TI  == association of targeted multiplex pcr with resequencing microarray for the detection of multiple respiratory pathogens.
AB  == a large number of viral and bacterial organisms are responsible for community-acquired pneumonia (cap) which contributes to substantial burden on health management. a new resequencing microarray (rpm-ivdc1) associated with targeted multiplex pcr was recently developed and validated for multiple respiratory viruses detection and discrimination. in this study, we evaluated the capability of rpm-ivdc1 for simultaneous identification of multiple viral and bacterial organisms. the nasopharyngeal aspirates (npas) of 110 consecutive cap patients, aged from 1 month to 96 years old, were collected from five distinct general hospitals in beijing during 1-year period. the samples were subjected to  the rpm-ivdc1 established protocol as compared to a real-time pcr (qrt-pcr), which was used as standard. the results of virus detection were consistent with those previously described. a total of 37 of streptococcus pneumoniae, 14 of haemophilus influenzae, 10 of mycoplasma pneumoniae, two of klebsiella pneumoniae and one of moraxella catarrhalis were detected by rpm-ivdc1. the sensitivities and specificities were compared with those of qrt-pcr for s. pneumoniae (100, 100%, respectively), h. influenzae (92.3, 97.9%, respectively), m. pneumoniae (69.2, 99.0%, respectively), k. pneumoniae (100, 100%, respectively), and m. catarrhalis (100, 100%, respectively). additional 22 of streptococcus spp., 24 of haemophilus spp. and 16 of neisseria spp. were identified. in addition, methicillin-resistant and carbapenemases allele were also found in nine of staphylococcus spp. and one of k. pneumoniae, respectively. these results demonstrated the capability of rpm-ivdc1 for simultaneous detection of broad-spectrum respiratory pathogens in complex backgrounds and the advantage of  accessing to the actual sequences, showing great potential use of epidemic outbreak investigation. the detection results should be carefully interpreted when introducing this technique in the clinical diagnostics.

TI  == destruction-free procedure for the isolation of bacteria from sputum samples for  raman spectroscopic analysis.
AB  == lower respiratory tract infections are the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. here, a timely identification of the causing pathogens is crucial to the success of the treatment. raman spectroscopy allows for quick identification  of bacterial cells without the need for time-consuming cultivation steps, which is the current gold standard to detect pathogens. however, before raman spectroscopy can be used to identify pathogens, they have to be isolated from the sample matrix, i.e., sputum in case of lower respiratory tract infections. in this study, we report an isolation protocol for single bacterial cells from sputum samples for raman spectroscopic identification. prior to the isolation, a  liquefaction step using the proteolytic enzyme mixture pronase e is required in order to deal with the high viscosity of sputum. the extraction of the bacteria was subsequently performed via different filtration and centrifugation steps, whereby isolation ratios between 46 and 57 % were achieved for sputa spiked with  6.107 to 6.104 cfu/ml of staphylococcus aureus. the compatibility of such a liquefaction and isolation procedure towards a raman spectroscopic classification was shown for five different model species, namely s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. a classification of single-cell raman spectra of these five species with an accuracy of 98.5 % could be achieved on the basis of a principal component analysis (pca) followed by a linear discriminant analysis (lda). these  classification results could be validated with an independent test dataset, where 97.4 % of all spectra were identified correctly. graphical abstract development of an isolation protocol of bacterial cells out of sputum samples followed by raman spectroscopic measurement and species identification using chemometrical models.

TI  == development of two real-time multiplex pcr assays for the detection and quantification of eight key bacterial pathogens in lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  == the frequent lack of a positive and timely microbiological diagnosis in patients  with lower respiratory tract infection (lrti) is an important obstacle to antimicrobial stewardship. patients are typically prescribed broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics while microbiology results are awaited, but, because these  are often slow, negative, or inconclusive, de-escalation to narrow-spectrum agents rarely occurs in clinical practice. the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate two multiplex real-time pcr assays for the sensitive detection and accurate quantification of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii. we found that all eight bacterial targets could be reliably quantified from sputum specimens down to a concentration of 100 cfus/reaction (8333 cfus/ml). furthermore, all 249 positive control isolates were correctly detected with our assay, demonstrating effectiveness on both reference strains and local clinical isolates. the specificity was 98% on a panel of nearly 100 negative control isolates. bacterial load was quantified accurately when three bacterial targets were present in mixtures of varying concentrations, mimicking likely clinical scenarios in lrti.  concordance with culture was 100% for culture-positive sputum specimens, and 90%  for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens, and additional culture-negative bacterial infections were detected and quantified. in conclusion, a quantitative  molecular test for eight key bacterial causes of lrti has the potential to provide a more sensitive decision-making tool, closer to the time-point of patient admission than current standard methods. this should facilitate de-escalation from broad-spectrum to narrow-spectrum antibiotics, substantially improving patient management and supporting efforts to curtail inappropriate antibiotic use.

TI  == [th17 lymphocytes in bacterial infections].
AB  == th17 cells are a relatively newly discovered subpopulation of helper cd4+ t lymphocytes. it has been shown that these cells may contribute to tissue damage during certain inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and also play an important role in antitumor and antimicrobial, particularly antibacterial, immunity. bacteria stimulate the th17 response through several toll-like (tlr), nod-like (nlr) and c-type lectin (clr) receptors. when activated, th17 lymphocytes produce several cytokines, mainly interleukin (il)-17 and chemokines, that further attract and activate phagocytes to mediate bacterial clearance. thus th17 cells contribute to induction of host protective immunity, particularly against extracellular bacterial pathogens: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and klebsiella pneumoniae. furthermore, numerous studies indicate the  importance of th17 lymphocytes in immunity against intracellular bacteria such as francisella tularensis and chlamydia muridarum. in this case, the protective immune response is mediated mainly through stimulation of local dendritic cell (dc) function for establishing a th1 immune response, indispensable for controlling intracellular infectious agents. however, deregulation of the th17/il17 response during bacterial infections may lead to profound pathologies.  as a result, th17 cells participate in chronic inflammatory diseases, leading to  tissue destruction and favoring tumor development. this article summarizes current understanding of the bacteriainduced th17 response in the context of the  protective immune response and immunopathology.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam alone and in combination with avibactam against european gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == recent clinical isolates of key gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were collected in 2012 from hospitalised patients in medical centres in four european  countries (france, germany, italy and spain) and were tested using standard broth microdilution methodology to assess the impact of 4mg/l avibactam on the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam. against enterobacteriaceae, addition of avibactam significantly enhanced the level of activity of these antimicrobials. mic90 values (minimum inhibitory concentration that inhibits 90%  of the isolates) of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam for escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter  freundii and morganella morganii were reduced up to 128-fold or greater when combined with avibactam. a two-fold reduction in the mic90 of ceftazidime to 8mg/l was noted in pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates when combined with avibactam,  whereas little effect of avibactam was noted on the mic values of the test compounds when tested against acinetobacter baumannii isolates. avibactam had little effect on the excellent activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against haemophilus influenzae. it had no impact on the in vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftaroline against staphylococci and streptococci. this study demonstrates that addition of avibactam enhances the activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa but not against a. baumannii.

TI  == appendicitis in a child due to streptococcus pneumoniae: a rare case report.
AB  == a variety of bacterial species play a major role in appendicitis. both aerobic and anaerobic gram positive and gram negative bacteria such as, bacteroides fragilis, streptococcus species, escherichia coli, klebsiella species and citrobacter freundii cause appendicitis. appendicitis is usually polymicrobial. the case assumes importance because of single aetiological agent i.e. unimicrobial and no predisposing factors are present to cause infection. we report a rare case of appendicitis due to streptococcus pneumoniae in child. this case emphasizes that streptococcus pneumoniae can cause wide spectrum of disease  like appendicitis.

TI  == bacterial-resistance among outpatients of county hospitals in china: significant  geographic distinctions and minor differences between central cities.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to survey antibacterial resistance in outpatients of chinese county hospitals. a total of 31 county hospitals were selected and samples continuously collected from august 2010 to august 2011. drug sensitivity  testing was conducted in a central laboratory. a total of 2946 unique isolates were collected, including 634 strains of escherichia coli, 606 klebsiella pneumoniae, 476 staphylococcus aureus, 308 streptococcus pneumoniae, and 160 haemophilus influenzae. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in e. coli (42.3% strains), k. pneumoniae (31.7%), and proteus mirabilis (39.0%). ciprofloxacin-resistance was detected in 51.0% of e. coli strains. salmonella spp. and shigella spp. were sensitive to most antibacterial agents. less than 8.0% of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were resistant to carbapenem. for s. aureus strains, 15.3% were resistant to methicillin, and some strains of s. pneumoniae showed resistance to penicillin (1.6%), ceftriaxone (13.0%), and erythromycin (96.4%). beta-lactamase was produced by 96.5% of moraxella catarrhalis strains, and 36.2% of h. influenzae isolates were resistant to ampicillin. azithromycin-resistant h. influenzae, imipenem-resistant but meropenem-sensitive proteus, and ceftriaxone- and carbapenem non-sensitive m. catarrhalis were recorded. in conclusion, cephalosporin- and quinolone-resistant  strains of e. coli and klebsiella pneumonia and macrolide-resistant gram-positive cocci were relatively prominent in county hospitals. the antibacterial resistance profiles of isolates from different geographical locations varied significantly,  with proportions in county hospitals lower than those in their tertiary counterparts in the central cities, although the difference is diminishing.

TI  == pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis to evaluate ceftaroline fosamil dosing regimens for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and complicated skin and skin-structure infections in patients with normal and impaired renal function.
AB  == in this study, the probability of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target attainment (pta) of ceftaroline against clinical isolates causing community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (cabp) and complicated skin and skin-structure infection (csssi) in europe was evaluated. three dosing regimens were assessed: 600 mg every 12 h (q12 h) as a 1-h infusion (standard dose) or 600 mg every 8 h (q8 h) as a 2-h infusion in virtual patients with normal renal function; and 400 mg q12 h as a 1-h infusion in patients with moderate renal impairment. pharmacokinetic and microbiological data were obtained from the literature. the pta and the cumulative fraction of response (cfr) were calculated by monte carlo simulation. in patients with normal renal function, the ceftaroline standard dose (600 mg q12 h as a 1-h infusion) can be sufficient to treat cabp due to ceftazidime-susceptible (caz-s) escherichia coli, caz-s klebsiella pneumoniae, meticillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis (cfr>90%). however, against meticillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), the cfr was 72%. in csssi, the cfr was also <80% for mrsa. administration of ceftaroline 600  mg q8 h as a 2-h infusion or 400 mg q12 h as a 1-h infusion in patients with moderate renal insufficiency provided a high probability of treatment success (cfr ca. 100%) for most micro-organisms causing cabp and csssi, including mrsa and penicillin-non-susceptible s. pneumoniae. these results suggest that in patients with normal renal function, ceftaroline 600 mg q8 h as a 2-h infusion may be a better option than the standard dose, especially if the mrsa rate is high.

TI  == utilization of blood cultures in danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  == this national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (bcs). a primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. from the danish microbiology database, we retrieved all bcs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the national patient registry. in total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one bc was taken. almost 50% of bcs were taken at admission. the chance of having a bc taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one bc  was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. ten species, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. an increase in bcs and positive bcs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. bcs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for s. pneumoniae particularly. a predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to s. aureus, e. faecium and k. pneumoniae. minor differences in bcs and positive bcs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. the study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.

TI  == antibiotic resistance prevalence in routine bloodstream isolates from children's  hospitals varies substantially from adult surveillance data in europe.
AB  == background: surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (amr) is central for defining appropriate strategies to deal with changing amr levels. it is unclear whether childhood amr patterns differ from those detected in isolates from adult  patients. methods: resistance percentages of nonduplicate staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream isolates from children less than 18 years of age reported to the antibiotic resistance and prescribing in european children (arpec) project were compared with all-age resistance percentages reported by the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance network (ears-net) for the same pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, period and countries. in addition, resistance percentages were compared between arpec isolates from children less than 1 year of age and children greater than or equal to1 year of age. results: resistance percentages for many important pathogen-antibiotic class combinations were different for arpec isolates compared with ears-net. e. coli and k. pneumoniae fluoroquinolone  resistance percentages were substantially lower in arpec (13.4% and 17.9%) than in ears-net (23.0% and 30.7%), whereas the reverse was true for all pathogen-antibiotic class combinations in p. aeruginosa (for example, 27.3% aminoglycoside resistance in arpec, 19.3% in ears-net, 32.8% carbapenem resistance in arpec and 20.5% in ears-net), and for s. pneumoniae and macrolide resistance. for many gram-negative pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, isolates from children greater than or equal to 1 year of age showed higher resistance percentages than isolates from children less than 1 year of age. conclusions: age-stratified presentation of resistance percentage estimates by surveillance programs will allow identification of important variations in resistance patterns between different patient groups for targeted intervention.

TI  == enhanced mucosal antibody production and protection against respiratory infections following an orally administered bacterial extract.
AB  == secondary bacterial infections following influenza infection are a pressing problem facing respiratory medicine. although antibiotic treatment has been highly successful over recent decades, fatalities due to secondary bacterial infections remain one of the leading causes of death associated with influenza. we have assessed whether administration of a bacterial extract alone is sufficient to potentiate immune responses and protect against primary infection with influenza, and secondary infections with either streptococcus pneumoniae or  klebsiella pneumoniae in mice. we show that oral administration with the bacterial extract, om-85, leads to a maturation of dendritic cells and b-cells characterized by increases in mhc ii, cd86, and cd40, and a reduction in icosl. improved immune responsiveness against influenza virus reduced the threshold of susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections, and thus protected the mice. the protection was associated with enhanced polyclonal b-cell activation and release of antibodies that were effective at neutralizing the virus. taken together, these data show that oral administration of bacterial extracts provides sufficient mucosal immune stimulation to protect mice against a respiratory tract viral infection and associated sequelae.

AB  == antimicrobial peptides (amps) play a vital role in defense against resistant bacteria. in this study, eight different amps synthesized from python reticulatus serum protein were tested for bactericidal activity against various gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, burkholderia pseudomallei (khw and tes strains), and proteus vulgaris) using a disc-diffusion method (20 mug/disc). among the tested peptides, phospholipase a2 inhibitory peptide (pip)-18[59-76], beta-asp65-pip[59-67], d-ala66-pnt.ii, and d60,65e-pip[59-67] displayed the most potent bactericidal activity against all tested pathogens in a dose-dependent manner (100-6.8 mug/ml), with a remarkable activity noted against  s. aureus at 6.8 mug/ml dose within 6 h of incubation. determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) by a micro-broth dilution method at 100-3.125 mug/ml revealed that pip-18[59-76], beta-asp65-pip[59-67] and d-ala66-pnt.ii peptides exerted a potent inhibitory effect against s. aureus and b. pseudomallei (khw) (mics 3.125 mug/ml), while a much less inhibitory potency (mics 12.5 mug/ml) was noted for beta-asp65-pip[59-67] and d-ala66-pnt.ii peptides against b. pseudomallei (tes). higher doses of peptides had no effect on the other two strains (i.e., klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus pneumoniae). overall, pip-18[59-76] possessed higher antimicrobial activity than that of chloramphenicol (chl), ceftazidime (cf) and streptomycin (st) (30 mug/disc). when the two most active peptides, pip-18[59-76] and beta-asp65-pip[59-67], were applied topically at a 150 mg/kg dose for testing wound healing activity in a mouse model of s. aureus infection, the former accelerates faster wound healing than the latter peptide at 14 days post-treatment. the western blot data suggest  that the topical application of peptides (pip-18[59-67] and beta-asp65-pip[59-67]) modulates nf-kb mediated wound repair in mice with relatively little haemolytic (100-1.56 mug/ml) and cytotoxic (1000-3.125 mug/ml)  effects evident on human cells in vitro.

TI  == a recombinant horseshoe crab plasma lectin recognizes specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns of bacteria through rhamnose.
AB  == horseshoe crab is an ancient marine arthropod that, in the absence of a vertebrate-like immune system, relies solely on innate immune responses by defense molecules found in hemolymph plasma and granular hemocytes for host defense. a plasma lectin isolated from the hemolymph of taiwanese tachypleus tridentatus recognizes bacteria and lipopolysaccharides (lpss), yet its structure and mechanism of action remain unclear, largely because of limited availability of horseshoe crabs and the lack of a heterogeneous expression system. in this study, we have successfully expressed and purified a soluble and functional recombinant horseshoe crab plasma lectin (rhpl) in an escherichia coli system. interestingly, rhpl bound not only to bacteria and lpss like the native hpl but also to selective medically important pathogens isolated from clinical specimens, such as gram-negative pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae and gram-positive streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes. the binding was demonstrated to occur through a specific molecular interaction with rhamnose in pathogen-associated molecular patterns (pamps) on the bacterial surface. additionally, rhpl inhibited the growth of p. aeruginosa pao1 in a concentration-dependent manner. the results suggest that a specific protein-glycan interaction between rhpl and rhamnosyl residue may further facilitate development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for microbial pathogens.

TI  == prevalence of community-acquired bacteraemia in guinea-bissau: an observational study.
AB  == background: the burden of bloodstream infections is insufficiently studied in children in africa and many healthcare facilities lack the capacity to identify invasive disease. often studies have been limited to febrile patients or patients admitted to hospital. methods: blood cultures and malaria diagnostics was performed on 372 consecutive children presenting with tachycardia and/or fever to a referral paediatric emergency department in bissau, guinea-bissau. bacterial species detection, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and molecular typing were performed. the capacity of clinical parameters to identify bacteraemia was evaluated. results: the prevalence of bloodstream infection was 12% (46/372) and  in 46% (21/46) of the infections the child was non-febrile at presentation to the hospital. the predictive value for bacteraemia was poor for all assessed clinical parameters. staphylococcus aureus accounted for 54% (26/48) of the isolates followed by non-typhoidal salmonella, 10% (5/48), streptococcus pneumoniae, 8% (4/48), and salmonella typhi, 6% (3/48). among s. aureus there was a large diversity of spa types and 38% produced pantone-valentine leukocidin. antibiotic  resistance was low, however two out of three klebsiella pneumoniae isolates produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. malaria was laboratory confirmed in only 5% of the children but 64% (237/372) received a clinical malaria diagnosis.  conclusions: bacteraemia was common irrespective of the presence of fever among children presenting to the hospital. the high prevalence of staphylococcus aureus may be due to contamination. there is an imminent need to improve microbiological diagnostic facilities and to identify algorithms that can identify children at risk of bloodstream infections in africa.

TI  == antibacterial activity and mode of action of the artemisia capillaris essential oil and its constituents against respiratory tract infection-causing pathogens.
AB  == inhalation therapy using essential oils has been used to treat acute and chronic  sinusitis and bronchitis. the aim of the present study was to determine the chemical composition of the essential oil of artemisia capillaris, and evaluate the antibacterial effects of the essential oil and its main components, against common clinically relevant respiratory bacterial pathogens. gas chromatography and gas chromatographymass spectrometry revealed the presence of 25 chemical constituents, the main constituents being: alphapinene, betapinene, limonene, 1,8cineole, piperitone, betacaryophyllene and capillin. the antibacterial activities of the essential oil, and its major constituents, were evaluated against streptococcus pyogenes, methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), mrsa (clinical strain), methicillingentamicin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mgrsa), streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and escherichia coli. the essential oil and its constituents exhibited a broad spectrum and variable degree of antibacterial activity against the various strains. the essential oil was observed to be much more potent, as compared with any of its major chemical constituents, exhibiting low minimum inhibitory and bacteriocidal concentration values against all of the bacterial strains. the essential oil was most active against s. pyogenes, mrsa (clinical strain), s. pneumoniae, k. pneumoniae, h. influenzae and e. coli. piperitone and  capillin were the most potent growth inhibitors, among the major chemical constituents. furthermore, the essential oil of a. capillaris induced significant and dosedependent morphological changes in the s. aureus bacterial strain, killing >90% of the bacteria when administered at a higher dose; as determined by scanning electron microscopy. in addition, the essential oil induced a significant leakage of potassium and phosphate ions from the s. aureus bacterial  cultures. these results indicate that the antibacterial action of a. capillaris essential oil may be mediated through the leakage of these two important ions. in conclusion, a. capillaris essential oil exhibits potent antibacterial activity by inducing morphological changes and leakage of ions in s. aureus bacterial cultures.

TI  == timing of positive blood samples does not differentiate pathogens causing healthcare-associated from community-acquired bloodstream infections in children  in england: a linked retrospective cohort study.
AB  == summary paediatricians recognize that using the time-dependent community-acquired vs. hospital-acquired bloodstream infection (bsi) dichotomy to guide empirical treatment no longer distinguishes between causative pathogens due to the emergence of healthcare-associated bsis. however, paediatric epidemiological evidence of the aetiology of bsis in relation to hospital admission in england is lacking. for 12 common bsi-causing pathogens in england, timing of laboratory reports of positive paediatric (3 months to 5 years) bacterial blood isolates were linked to in-patient hospital data and plotted in relation to hospital admission. the majority (88.6%) of linked pathogens were isolated <2 days after hospital admission, including pathogens widely regarded as hospital acquired: enterococcus spp. (67.2%) and klebsiella spp. (88.9%). neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, group a streptococcus and salmonella spp. were unlikely to cause hospital-acquired bsi. pathogens commonly associated with hospital-acquired bsi are being isolated <2 days after hospital admission alongside pathogens commonly associated with community-acquired bsi. we confirm that timing of blood samples alone does not differentiate between bacterial pathogens. additional factors including clinical patient characteristics and healthcare contact should be considered to help predict the causative pathogen and guide empirical antibiotic therapy.

TI  == in vitro fermentation of lactulose by human gut bacteria.
AB  == lactulose has been known as a prebiotic that can selectively stimulate the growth of beneficial bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. recent studies have indicated that streptococcus mutans, clostridium perfringens, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii are also able to utilize lactulose. however, the previous studies mainly focused  on the utilization of lactulose by individual strains, and few studies were designed to identify the species that could utilize lactulose among gut microbiota. this study aimed to identify lactulose-metabolizing bacteria in the human gut, using in silico and traditional culture methods. the prediction results suggested that genes for the transporters and glycosidases of lactulose are well distributed in the genomes of 222 of 453 strains of gastrointestinal-tract bacteria. the screening assays identified 35 species with  the ability to utilize lactulose, of which cronobacter sakazakii, enterococcus faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas putida were reported for the first time to be capable of utilizing lactulose. in addition, significant correlations between lactulose and galactooligosaccharide metabolism were found.  thus, more attention should be paid to bacteria besides bifidobacteria and lactobacilli to further investigate the relationship between functional oligosaccharides and gut bacteria.

TI  == functional synergy of alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides and traditional antibiotics against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == in this study, the antimicrobial activities based on the synergistic effects of traditional antibiotics (imipenem, cefepime, levofloxacin hydrochloride and vancomycin) and antimicrobial peptides (amps; pl-5, pl-31, pl-32, pl-18, pl-29 and pl-26), alone or in combination, against three gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus epidermidis)  and three gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae) were investigated. in addition, the antimicrobial activity that was based on the synergistic effects of levofloxacin hydrochloride and pl-5  against staphylococcus aureus in vivo was explored in a mouse infection model. traditional antibiotics and amps showed significant synergistic effects on the antibacterial activities against the different gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in vitro. a strong synergistic effect in the pl-5 and levofloxacin hydrochloride combination against staphylococcus aureus was observed in the mouse infection model in vivo. the mechanism of synergistic action was due to the different targets of amps and traditional antibiotics. the combination of amps and traditional antibiotics can dramatically enhance antimicrobial activity and may help prevent or delay the emergence of antibiotic resistance. thus, this combination therapy could be a promising approach to treat bacterial infections,  particularly mixed infections and multi-antibiotic-resistant infections, in the clinics.

TI  == platelet-rich plasma affects bacterial growth in vitro.
AB  == background aims: platelet-rich plasma (prp), a blood derivative rich in platelets, is a relatively new technique used in tissue regeneration and engineering. the increased quantity of platelets makes this formulation of considerable value for their role in tissue healing and microbicidal activity. this activity was investigated against five of the most important strains involved in nosocomial infections (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis) to understand the prophylactic role of pure (p)-prp. microbicidal proteins released  from activated p-prp platelets were also determined. methods: the microbicidal activity of p-prp and platelet-poor plasma (ppp) was evaluated on different concentrations of the five bacterial strains incubated for 1, 2, 4 and 18 h and plated on agar for 18-24 h. p-prp and ppp-released microbicidal proteins were evaluated by means of multiplex bead-based immunoassays. results: p-prp and ppp inhibited bacterial growth for up to 2 h of incubation. the effect of p-prp was significantly higher than that of ppp, mainly at the low seeding concentrations and/or shorter incubation times, depending on the bacterial strain. chemokine (c-c motif) ligand-3, chemokine (c-c motif) ligand-5 and chemokine (c-x-c motif)  ligand-1 were the molecules mostly related to pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis inhibition. escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were less influenced. conclusions: the present results show that p-prp might supply an early protection against bacterial contaminations during surgical interventions because the inhibitory activity is already evident  from the first hour of treatment, which suggests that physiological molecules supplied in loco might be important in the time frame needed for the activation of the innate immune response.

TI  == subclinical pulmonary pathogenic infection in camels slaughtered in cairo, egypt.
AB  == introduction: camels migrate between the open boundaries of sudan and egypt either for grazing or for slaughtering. bad hygiene and stress is often related to pulmonary diseases in camels. this study investigated whether camels slaughtered in cairo carried pulmonary infections. methodology: five hundred lung tissues of slaughtered camels were examined and 100 samples suspected for pulmonary infection were subjected to microbial identification and histopathology. results: a total of 70 lung tissues revealed 97 bacterial isolates of 8 species, including staphylococcus aureus (37.14%), escherichia coli (27.14%), klebsiella pneumoniae (26.71%), bacillus spp. (25.72%), streptococcus pyogenes (10%), corynebacterium spp. (8.85 %), pasteurella spp. (2.85%), and arcanobacterium pyogenes (1.4%). some of these species were earlier reported to be associated with pulmonary infection. histopathology revealed different types of pneumonia in 50% of the investigated lungs. conclusions: a considerable number of apparently healthy camels carry pathogenic agents in their lower respiratory tracts. immunosuppression and stressful conditions might influence these pathogens to induce respiratory diseases in camels. thus, the infected camels might act as reservoir of these infections agents. if adequate care is not taken, this might be a threat to abattoir workers and may spread infections to humans.

TI  == development of an immunochromatographic test with anti-lipl32-coupled gold nanoparticles for leptospira detection.
AB  == detection of antibody specific to leptospira by various immunological techniques  has been used for leptospirosis diagnosis. however, the sensitivity of antibody detection during the first few days after infection is low. molecular techniques  are suggested to provide earlier diagnosis than antibody detection, but a rapid and easy to perform assay for leptospira antigen detection would provide an additional useful tool for disease diagnosis. in this study, we coupled gold nanoparticles with antibody to lipl32, a protein commonly found in pathogenic leptospira. this coupled gold reagent was used in the immunochromatographic strip for leptospira detection. we demonstrated that the sensitivity of leptospira detection by this strip was 10(3) ml(-1). there was no positive result detected when strips were tested with non-pathogenic leptospira, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus group b, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis or enterococcus faecium. these data suggest that gold nanoparticles coupled with antibody to lipl32 could  be used for leptospira detection by a rapid test based on an immunochromatographic technique.

TI  == colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip test compromising optimised combinations of anti-s. suis capsular polysaccharide polyclonal antibodies for detection of streptococcus suis.
AB  == a rapid diagnosis kit that detects streptococcus suis (s. suis) antigens from urine with an immunochromatographic stripe (ics) test was developed in this study. the ics test was produced using colloidal gold coated with polyclonal antibodies (pabs) against s. suis. the pabs were developed from rabbits immunised with s. suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharides (cps). development of the pabs was investigated to establish their binding to cps and to determine the maximum sensitivity of two combination antibodies for the ics test. the results of the ics optimisation revealed that the combinations of pab c-n1 and pab c-n2 had the  highest sensitivity to cps. the minimum limitation of ics sensitivity indicated 1.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (cfu) and a cps concentration of 0.05 microg. the assay time for detection of s. suis antigens is less than 15 min, which is suitable for rapid detection. a cross-reactive test was also conducted, and it detected no other bacteria (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae). the cross-reactivity of other serotypes in s. suis was also investigated, and tests for serotypes of 1, 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6,  7, 8, 9, 14, and 16 were positive. this study presents the first report of a development of an ics that enables the quantitative detection of streptococcal antigens. the s. suis ics provides several advantages over other methods, including the speed and simplicity of use.

TI  == occurrence of urinary tract infection in adolescent and adult women of shanty town in dhaka city, bangladesh.
AB  == background: urinary tract infection (uti) is commonly experienced by women of various age groups especially elderly ones. we planned to find out the prevalent  microbial strains causing uti in slum inhabitant adolescent and adult women in dhaka city, bangladesh. methods and materials: urine sample was collected from 462 uti suspected female subjects. pathogenic bacteria were identified using standard microbiological tests, and antimicrobial sensitivity profiles of the pathogens were determined. results: bacteriuria was present in 9% of the subjects. a higher incidence (16.8%) of uti was noted among adult women aged above 19 years. escherichia coli (69%), streptococcus spp. (15%) and pseudomonas  aeruginosa (7%) were more frequently isolated from the urine samples compared to  enterococcus faecalis (3%), staphylococcus aureus (2%), klebsiella pneumoniae (2%) and hafnia alvei (2%). the e. coli isolates showed complete resistance to commonly used drugs, and 58% of these isolates were multidrug resistant (mdr). minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values for ciprofloxacin ranged between 64microg/ml and 512microg/ml, and the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) values against the isolates were 128microg/ml or above. isolated strains of e. coli exhibited equal extent of ciprofloxacin resistance irrespective of the presence or absence of plasmid in them. conclusion: the extent of drug resistance among the uropathogens if ignored may render them uncontrollable. this study suggests regular monitoring of drug resistance phenotype of the uti pathogens to  reduce the morbidity of female uti patients and offer better treatment strategy in the healthcare sectors of bangladesh.

TI  == lung abscess due to streptococcus pneumoniae: a case series and brief review of the literature.
AB  == anaerobes used to be the most common cause of community-acquired lung abscess, and streptococcus species used to be the second most common cause. in recent years, this has been changing. klebsiella pneumoniae is now an increasing cause of community- acquired lung abscess, but streptococcus species continue to be major pathogens. necrotizing pneumonia has generally been regarded as a rare complication of pneumococcal infection in adults. type 3 streptococcus pneumoniae was the single most common type implicated in necrosis; however, many other serotypes were implicated. this entity predominately infects children, but is present also in adults. lung abscess in adults due to streptococcus pneumoniae is not common. in this regard we present a case series of pulmonary cavitation due to streptococcus pneumoniae and discuss the possible pathogenic mechanism of the  disease.

TI  == management of necrotizing pneumonia and pulmonary gangrene: a case series and review of the literature.
AB  == background: necrotizing pneumonia is an uncommon but severe complication of bacterial pneumonia, associated with high morbidity and mortality. the availability of current data regarding the management of necrotizing pneumonia is limited to case reports and small retrospective observational cohort studies. consequently, appropriate management for these patients remains unclear. objective: to describe five cases and review the available literature to help guide management of necrotizing pneumonia. methods: cases involving five adults with respiratory failure due to necrotizing pneumonia admitted to a tertiary care centre and infected with streptococcus pneumoniae (n=3), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1) and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (n=1) were reviewed. all available literature was reviewed and encompassed case reports and retrospective  reviews dating from 1975 to the present. results: all five patients received aggressive medical management and consultation by thoracic surgery. three patients underwent surgical procedures to debride necrotic lung parenchyma. two of the five patients died in hospital. conclusions: necrotizing pneumonia often leads to pulmonary gangrene. computed tomography of the thorax with contrast is recommended to evaluate the pulmonary vascular supply. further study is necessary to determine whether surgical intervention, in the absence of pulmonary gangrene, results in better outcomes.

TI  == bacterial isolates associated with pelvic inflammatory disease among female patients attending some hospitals in abuja, nigeria.
AB  == background: pelvic inflammatory disease refers to any infection in the female lower reproductive tract that spreads to the upper reproductive tract. the disease comprises a spectrum of inflammatory disorders of the upper female genital tract, including any combination of endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess and pelvic peritonitis. pid is not a notifiable disease in most countries, so accurate statistics are not available. this situation is not in any way different here in nigeria and more so in the federal capital territory, abuja where this research was conducted, there had never been any published report so far on pid. it therefore became pertinent that such studies be carried out to evaluate the bacterial organisms which may be associated with the disease in this part of nigeria so that health care providers could take a better look at this affliction in women. materials and methods: endocervical swabs totalling 100 were aseptically collected from patients with confirmed pelvic inflammatory disease (pid), attending some hospitals in abuja, nigeria for detection of bacterial pathogens based on cultural and biochemical characterisation tests. antibiogram was also conducted on the identified bacterial isolates. results: out of the 100 samples analysed, 43% yielded pure cultures of bacterial isolates, 2% yielded mixed cultures while no bacterial growths were recorded from the remaining 55% samples. organisms encountered were  staphylococcus aureus (16%), escherichia coli (10%), streptococcus faecalis (8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%), streptococcus pyogenes (3%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), proteus rettgeri (2%) and proteus mirabilis (1%). the highest percentage occurrence of pathogenic isolates was observed in polygamous married patients (90%). the age group most affected falls within the mean age 30.5 years (68%) while the least affected group falls within the mean age 40.5 years (5%). there was a significant difference in the acquisition of pid in relation to marital status (p < 0.05). however there was no significant difference in the acquisition of the disease with respect to age (p > 0.05). antibiogram patterns of pathogenic isolates revealed varied resistance to most of the antibiotics employed. cefotaxime (a new generation cephalosporin antibiotic) was established in this study as the best antimicrobial agent for treatment of pid due to gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from the women examined. conclusion: in conclusion, pelvic inflammatory disease is a major health problem in developed or developing countries of the world. pid is not a notifiable disease, as accurate statistics on disease prevalence are rarely available. there is therefore no doubt thousands of young women have salpingitis every year and their sheer number makes it an important health problem. pid hence can be said to be a very serious  complication of sexually transmitted disease which should be critically and promptly handled by healthcare providers. the right type sample should be aseptically collected and be appropriately handled for laboratory investigation.  treatment of pid should be initiated as soon as the presumptive diagnosis has been made. immediate administration of antibiotics has been effective in the long-term sequelae associated with pid, especially new generation antibiotics, such as cefotaxime as recorded in this study.

TI  == contemporary use of ceftaroline fosamil for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia: capture study experience.
AB  == the clinical assessment program and teflaro((r)) utilization registry (capture) is a multicenter cohort study designed to collect information on the contemporary use of ceftaroline fosamil in the us. data collected from 398 evaluable patients  with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (cabp) (mean age 64 years) during the first 18 months of the study are presented. most patients had co-morbidities (76%; primarily structural lung disease), and >==2 signs and symptoms of cabp (76%). overall clinical success was 79% which varied little with ceftaroline fosamil usage (monotherapy vs concurrent therapy; first-line vs second-line therapy). most patients were discharged home (60%) or to another healthcare facility (35%). these data suggest that ceftaroline, in contemporary clinical use, is an effective antibiotic for the treatment of patients with cabp, including those with significant co-morbidities or who required a change of their prior antibiotic therapy.

TI  == prevalence and risk factors for antibiotic-resistant community-associated bloodstream infections.
AB  == background: antibiotic resistance is increasing in many community settings. the purpose of this study was to determine the proportion of antibiotic resistant community-associated bloodstream infections (ca-bsis) present on hospital admissions to identify risk factors for acquiring resistant versus susceptible ca-bsis and to describe the incidence of concurrent infections with ca-bsis. methods: we conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients discharged from one community, one pediatric, and two tertiary/quaternary care hospitals within an academically affiliated network in the borough of manhattan in new york, ny, from 2006 to 2008. the ca-bsis present at hospital admission were defined as bsis occurring within the first 48h of hospitalization. infections and patient characteristics were identified using data available from patients' electronic medical records and discharge records. results: in total, 1677 ca-bsis were identified. staphylococcus aureus had the largest proportion of resistance (41.2%), followed by enterococcal species (24.3%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.2%), streptococcus pneumoniae (16.6%), acinetobacter baumannii (10.0%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (9.9%). significant predictors of resistance were prior residence in a skilled nursing facility (or, 2.55; 95% ci, 1.39-4.70), advanced age (1.01; 1.002-1.02), presence of malignancy (0.58; 0.37-0.91), prior hospitalization (1.62; 1.17-2.23), a weighted charlson score (1.09; 1.02-1.17) for s. aureus, presence of malignancy (1.82; 1.004-3.30), prior hospitalizations  (2.03; 1.12-3.38) for enterococcal species, and younger age for s. pneumoniae (p=0.02). urinary tract infections were the most common concurrent infection (n=45/87, 51.7%). conclusion: over 27% of the ca-bsis present on admission were antibiotic resistant. understanding the prevalence and risk factors for ca-bsis may help improve empiric antibiotic therapy and outcomes for patients with community-onset infections.

TI  == contamination of medical charts: an important source of potential infection in hospitals.
AB  == objective: this prospective study aims to identify and compare the incidence of bacterial contamination of hospital charts and the distribution of species responsible for chart contamination in different units of a tertiary hospital. methods: all beds in medical, surgical, pediatric, and obstetric-gynecologic general wards (556) and those in corresponding special units (125) including medical, surgical, pediatric intensive care units (icus), the obstetric tocolytic unit and delivery room were surveyed for possible chart contamination. the outer  surfaces of included charts were sampled by one experienced investigator with sterile cotton swabs rinsed with normal saline. results: for general wards and special units, the overall sampling rates were 81.8% (455/556) and 85.6% (107/125) (p = 0.316); the incidence of chart contamination was 63.5% and 83.2%,  respectively (p<0.001). except for obstetric-gynecologic charts, the incidence was significantly higher in each and in all icus than in corresponding wards. coagulase-negative staphylococci was the most common contaminant in general wards (40.0%) and special units (34.6%) (p>0.05). special units had a significantly higher incidence of bacterial contamination due to staphylococcus aureus (17.8%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (9.3%), streptococcus viridans (9.4%), escherichia coli (11.2%), klebsiella pneumoniae (7.5%), and acinetobacter baumannii (7.5%). logistic regression analysis revealed the incidence of chart contamination was 2- to 4-fold higher in special units than in general wards [odds ratios: 1.97-4.00]. conclusions: noting that most hospital charts are contaminated, our study confirms that a hospital chart is not only a medical record but also an important source of potential infection. the plastic cover of  the medical chart can harbor potential pathogens, thus acting as a vector of bacteria. additionally, chart contamination is more common in icus. these findings highlight the importance of effective hand-washing before and after handling medical charts. however, managers and clinical staff should pay more attention to the issue and may consider some interventions.

TI  == secretion of a pneumococcal type ii secretion system pilus correlates with dna uptake during transformation.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is a major human pathogen that successfully adapts to the host environment via an efficient uptake system for free dna liberated from other organisms in the upper respiratory tract, facilitating immune evasion and drug resistance. although the initial signaling events leading to pneumococcal competence for dna transformation and the fate of dna when it has been taken up have been extensively studied, the actual mechanism by which dna in the environment may traverse the thick capsular and cell wall layers remains unknown. here we visualize that induction of competence results in the formation of a native morphologically distinct pilus structure on the bacterial surface. this plaited pilus is encoded by the competence (com)g locus, and, after assembly, it  is rapidly released into the surrounding medium. heterologous pneumococcal pilus  expression in escherichia coli was obtained by replacing the pule-k putative pilin genes of the klebsiella oxytoca type ii secretion system with the complete  comg locus. in the pneumococcus, the coordinated secretion of pili from the cells correlates to dna transformation. a model for dna transformation is proposed whereby pilus assembly "drills" a channel across the thick cell wall that becomes transiently open by secretion of the pilus, providing the entry port for exogenous dna to gain access to dna receptors associated with the cytoplasmic membrane.

TI  == oral microflora: a comparative study in hiv and normal patients.
AB  == the study was designed to compare the oral microbiota in normal and hiv-infected  individuals. the study tries to establish a significant shift in oral microflora  in hiv-infected patients. antibiotic sensitivity testing was performed to establish any rise in resistance against the antibiotics. it was a two and half year prospective study conducted in a tertiary care centre. the study group consisted of eighty subjects divided into two groups of control and hiv. the age  range for this group was 9-75 years. the mean age in this group was 39.7 years. the male:female ratio was 2.75:1. tuberculosis was the most common opportunistic  infection in patients with hiv infection. the most common commensal micro organism isolated was the viridans streptococci in 60% followed by streptococcus  pneumoniae in 23.33%. hiv group: the most common commensal micro organism isolated was the viridans streptococci in 42%; this was followed by the micrococci spp. in 22% cases. s. pneumoniae was isolated in 6% of cases. the colony count for viridans streptococci showed a heavy growth in 55.56% of cases in controls whereas the same in hiv group was 62.5%. micrococcus spp. was isolated from 11 subjects in hiv group while it was not isolated from the controls. 50% subjects in the hiv group showed a heavy growth of klebsiella spp.  whereas controls showed only moderate and scanty growth. in patients with cd4+ t  cell count less than 50 cells/mul we found a heavy colonization of the oral cavity with micrococcus spp., acinetobacter and klebsiella spp. viridans streptococcus was not isolated in any of the patients with cd4+ t cell count less than 50 cells/mul. as cd4+ t cells counts improved to 51-100 cells/mul viridans streptococcus colonies returned and 37.5% patients showed a heavy growth. micrococcus spp. colonies were isolated till the cd4+ t cells improved up to 300  cells/mul. at counts > 300 cells/mul the oral microbiota became comparable to that of the controls. many of the opportunistic infections in hiv are caused by commensal bacteria which are otherwise harmless in a normal individual. our study is unique in that such a study of the oral commensals in hiv patients has never been reported. we found an increased colonization of the oral cavity by micrococcus spp. which is a normal commensal of the skin.

TI  == removal of bacteria from stallion semen by colloid centrifugation.
AB  == bacteria (environmental contaminants and occasionally potential pathogens) are found in most stallion ejaculates and may negatively affect sperm quality during  storage. since the use of antibiotics can lead to the development of resistance,  an alternative means of microbial control is desirable. the removal of bacteria from stallion semen using single layer centrifugation through androcoll-e was investigated. known doses of cultured bacteria were added to freshly collected ejaculates (15ml aliquots) before processing by single layer centrifugation. the  resulting sperm pellets and controls (not processed by single layer centrifugation) were cultured and the bacteria identified. in experiment 1, doses of e. coli from 2x10(2) to 2x10(7) colony forming units were added to aliquots of semen. in experiment 2, taylorella equigenitalis or a mix of e. coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae and streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (approximately 7x10(6), 5x10(6), and 6x10(6)cfu, respectively) were added to 15ml aliquots of semen. in experiment 1, more than 90% of the bacteria were removed where loading doses were >x10(4)cfu/ml. in experiment 2, varying proportions of different bacteria were removed, ranging from 68% for naturally occurring corynebacterium spp. to >97% for added cultured e. coli. thus, single layer centrifugation can separate spermatozoa from many, but not all bacteria in stallion ejaculates and could be a useful alternative to adding antibiotics to semen extenders to control bacterial  contamination. however, further research is needed to determine the effect of small numbers of bacteria on sperm quality.

TI  == 16s rdna-based metagenomic analysis of dental plaque and lung bacteria in patients with severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  == background and objective: acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ae-copd) are leading causes of mortality in hospital intensive care units. we sought to determine whether dental plaque biofilms might harbor pathogenic bacteria that can eventually cause lung infections in patients with severe ae-copd. material and methods: paired samples of subgingival plaque biofilm and tracheal aspirate were collected from 53 patients with severe ae-copd. total bacterial dna was extracted from each sample individually for polymerase chain reaction amplification and/or generation of bacterial 16s rdna sequences and cdna libraries. we used a metagenomic approach, based on bacterial  16s rdna sequences, to compare the distribution of species present in dental plaque and lung. results: analysis of 1060 sequences (20 clones per patient) revealed a wide range of aerobic, anaerobic, pathogenic, opportunistic, novel and uncultivable bacterial species. species indistinguishable between the paired subgingival plaque and tracheal aspirate samples (97-100% similarity in 16s rdna  sequence) were dental plaque pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) and lung pathogens (acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae). real-time polymerase chain reaction of 16s rdna indicated lower levels of pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis colonizing the dental plaques compared with the paired tracheal aspirate samples. conclusion: these results support the  hypothesis that dental bacteria may contribute to the pathology of severe ae-copd.

TI  == ceftaroline activity against bacterial organisms isolated from acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections in united states medical centers (2009-2011).
AB  == ceftaroline, the active metabolite of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, is a new cephalosporin with bactericidal activity against resistant gram-positive organisms including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and multidrug-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, and commonly isolated gram-negative organisms, including ceftriaxone-susceptible enterobacteriaceae. we evaluated the in vitro activity of ceftaroline and selected comparator agents against bacterial isolates collected from patients with acute bacterial skin and  skin structure infections (absssis) in the usa. a total of 6222 isolates were collected from 67 medical centers distributed across all nine usa census regions  between 2009 and 2011 and tested for susceptibility by reference broth microdilution methods. ceftaroline was very active against s. aureus (mic50/90, 0.5/1 mug/ml; 99.6% susceptible), including mrsa (mic50/90, 0.5/1 mug/ml; 99.1% susceptible). against beta-hemolytic streptococci, the activity of ceftaroline (mic50/90, </=0.015/0.03 mug/ml; 100.0% susceptible) was comparable to that of both penicillin (mic50/90, </=0.06/</=0.06 mug/ml; 100.0% susceptible) and ceftriaxone (mic50/90, </=0.25/</=0.25 mug/ml; 100.0% susceptible). ceftaroline was also highly active against viridans group streptococci (mic50/90, 0.03/0.06 mug/ml). similar to ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, ceftaroline was active against wild-type strains of escherichia coli (mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml; 94.0% susceptible) and klebsiella pneumoniae (mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml; 96.8% susceptible); however, the ceftaroline activity was compromised among strains with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-phenotype (mic50/90, >32/>32 mug/ml for  both e. coli and k. pneumoniae). in summary, ceftaroline showed potent activity against a large contemporary collection (6222) of bacterial isolates associated with absssi in the usa.

TI  == hira-tan: a real-time pcr-based system for the rapid identification of causative  agents in pneumonia.
AB  == identification of the causative pathogen(s) of pneumonia would allow the selection of effective antibiotics and thus reduce the mortality rate and the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens. to identify such pathogens and to obtain these benefits, it is necessary that a clinical test is rapid, accurate, easily performed, and cost-effective. here, we devised a pcr-based test, named hira-tan, which is able to discriminate therapeutic targets from commensal organisms (e.g.  streptococcus pneumoniae or haemophilus influenzae) and to detect foreign organisms (e.g. mycoplasma pneumoniae or legionella pneumophila) in the sputum. the utility of this system was validated in a prospective study, using sputum samples from patients with pneumonia. 568 patients were enrolled and the hira-tan assay identified the causative pathogens with an accuracy of 96.7% for h. influenzae; 93.2% for pseudomonas aeruginosa; 80.6% for klebsiella pneumoniae; 90.9% for moraxella catarrhalis; 87.5% for escherichia coli; 78.1% for mrsa and 91.6% for s. pneumoniae. overall the hira-tan procedure was able to identify the  causative pathogens of pneumonia in 60% of the cases. additionally, this procedure was able to determine when the pneumonia-causing organism was a commensal organism or a foreign organism in a single assay. the hira-tan approach yielded reproducible results and provided valuable information to plan the course of treatment of pneumonia. through the rapid identification of the causative pathogens, the hira-tan will promote targeted treatments for pneumonias. clinical trials registration: umin000001694.

TI  == [diversity analysis of biofilm bacteria on tracheal tubes removed from intubated  neonates].
AB  == objective: the catheter-related infections caused by mechanical ventilation have  become a intractable clinical problem, and it is related to the formation of bacterial biofilm (bf) on the surface of the implanted material. the majority of  natural biofilms are formed by multiple bacterial species. however, there always  only one or limited species were detected on tracheal tubes removed from intubated neonates by using traditional methods including bacterium culture and antigen detection. the aims of this study were to observe the bacterial communities diversity of bf on endotracheal tube (ett), and discuss the difference between traditional bacterium culture methods and the use of molecular biology techniques on the basis of denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), to provide new ideas for clinical prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections. method: thirty-five etts were obtained from 26 neonates on  mechanical ventilator (from october 2012 to march 2013) in department of neonatology of children's hospital. among the patients, 18 were boys and 8 girls, and 19 patients were < 37 weeks gestational age and 7 patients >/= 37 weeks. dgge profiling of 16s rdna gene amplicons was used to assess the diversity of the bacterial population by using the software of quantity one. ta cloning kit and sequencing were used to investigate the distribution of bacteria and common dominant bacteria in ett-bf. result: the mean bands of 35 etts cases were 13.8 +/- 5.4 from 16s rdna pcr-dgge, and the mean shanon-wiener indexes was 2.42 +/- 0.38. the 16 etts were collected in different stages of diseases from the 7 patients. the indwelling days of 6/7 patients' etts increased, the shanon-siener  indexes were decreased. among the 6 cases from different basic illnesses, and there were different shanon-siener indexes. the result of molecular cloning and sequencing for 24 dominant bands showed that 35 cases (100%) contained klebsiella sp., 28 cases (80%) had pseudomonas sp., 27 cases (77%) had streptococcus sp., and 32 cases (91%) had uncultured bacterium, while more than 2 bacterial species  were found in 34 cases (97%). 28/35 (80%) klebsiella sp. and 22/27(82%) streptococcus sp. were accompanied by pseudomonas sp.. there were 22 positive results of sputum culture from 26 newborns, including 10 strains (45%) of klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 strains (9%) of acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae and non-cultured bacterium in each patient (5%), but only one bacterium isolated from every sputum. eight sputum samples had normal flora only, corresponding to the etts on which klebsiella and other bacterial genuses were found. conclusion: the diversity of microbiota in bf on ett was confirmed. 16s rdna pcr-dgge could produce a more complete picture of bacterial community than traditional bacterium culture method. klebsiella, pseudomonas and streptococcus were common dominant bacteria in ett-bf, and there might be interactions among them in the formation of bf.

AB  == background: physicians depend on reliable information on the local epidemiology of infection and antibiotic resistance rates to guide empiric treatment in critically ill patients. as these data are scarce for central africa, we performed a retrospective analysis of microbiological findings from a secondary care hospital in gabon. methods: microbiological reports from 2009 to 2012 were used to assess the non-susceptibility rates of the three most common isolates from six major types of infections (bloodstream, ear-eye-nose-throat, surgical site, skin and soft tissue, urinary tract and wound infection). results: a high diversity of pathogens was found, but staphylococcus aureus was predominant in the majority of infections. overall, the three most prevalent pathogens in children were s. aureus (33.7%), streptococcus pyogenes (8.1%) and escherichia coli (4.5%) and in adults s. aureus (23.5%), e. coli (15.1%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (7.4%). in total, 5.8% (n = 19) of all s. aureus isolates were methicillin resistant. the proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)  producing enterobacteriaceae was 15.4% (n = 78), 49.4% of all k. pneumoniae were  esbl-producer (n = 42). conclusion: the high diversity of potential pathogens and high resistance rates in gram-negative bacteria challenge a rational empiric use  of antibiotics. countrywide continuous sentinel surveillance is therefore urgently needed.

TI  == update of contemporary antimicrobial resistance rates across china: reference testing results for 12 medical centers (2011).
AB  == antimicrobial resistance (r) surveillance across asia and especially in china has documented unique patterns and mechanisms. this 2011 study reports results for 2278 isolates from 12 hospitals in china (94-216 strains/site); most from bacteremia (20.4%), pneumonias (29.1%), or skin and skin structure infections (20.9%). samples were tested by reference broth microdilution methods, interpreted by published susceptibility (s) breakpoints. the most common species  were staphylococcus aureus (343, 45.8% mrsa), escherichia coli (ec; 288), pseudomonas aeruginosa (psa; 221), klebsiella spp. (ksp; 208), acinetobacters (acb; 178), enterobacters (155), streptococcus pneumoniae (spn; 154, 46.8% penicillin-s), and enterococci (ent; 137). among 849 gram-positive (gp) cocci, linezolid, tigecycline (tig), daptomycin, and vancomycin provided best antimicrobial coverage (>/=99.7% s). resistance patterns of concern were 0.3% visa, 15.4% teicoplanin non-s coagulase-negative staphylococci, 1.5% vancomycin-r ent (all enterococcus faecium), 1.9% levofloxacin-r beta-haemolytic streptococci, and 35.1 and 12.7% ceftriaxone-non-s rates for spn and viridans group streptococci, respectively. for gram-negative bacilli, r among enterobacteriaceae was highest against beta-lactams (extended spectrum beta-lactamase-phenotype strains at 73.6 and 42.8% in ec and ksp, respectively; carbapenem-r was only 2.1-4.3% with kpc and imp type enzymes detected in ksp). the widest spectrum agents were cefoperazone/sulbactam (79.5-86.1%), piperacillin/tazobactam (88.9-92.0%), tig (98.6-100%), amikacin (amk; 91.8-93.7%), and meropenem (95.7-97.1% s). psa was most inhibited by amk (90.5% s) and colistin (col; 99.5%), with cefepime (67.9%) best among the tested beta-lactams. only col (100%  s) and tig (mic90, 2 mug/ml) showed significant potencies against acb. in conclusion, r among pathogens from 12 chinese hospitals illustrates several agents active against gp pathogens, but more serious r problems were noted among  enterobacteriaceae, psa, and acb. combination treatment for the latter multidrug-r strains appears necessary, guided by local antibiograms and national  surveillance results applying reference methods.

TI  == nasopharyngeal bacterial colonisation in hiv-positive children in cambodia.
AB  == objective: to determine patterns of nasopharyngeal colonisation in hiv-positive children. methods: nasopharyngeal, nasal and ear swabs were prospectively taken from all children living in two paediatric nursing homes for hiv-positive orphans in cambodia from 2004 to 2011. results: a total of 882 swabs were taken, of which 586 tested positive for bacteria. staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated species (178 isolates; 30.4%) followed by streptococcus pneumoniae (103  isolates; 17.6%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (99 isolates; 16.9%). the rate of s. pneumoniae decreased in 2009 when a vaccination programme was introduced. conclusions: the respiratory tract of hiv-positive children receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy is commonly colonised by s. aureus and s. pneumoniae, while other species normally found in the respiratory tract, such as  moraxella catarrhalis, are far less frequent.

TI  == community-acquired, healthcare-associated and hospital-acquired bloodstream infection definitions in children: a systematic review demonstrating inconsistent criteria.
AB  == background: historically, bacterial infections were categorized as either community-acquired (ca) or hospital-acquired (ha). however, the ca/ha dichotomy no longer adequately reflects patterns of emerging healthcare-associated (hca) infections in complex patients managed between hospital and the community. studies trying to define this evolving epidemiology often excluded children. aim: to identify what criteria have been used to distinguish between ca, hca and ha bloodstream infections (bsis) in children, and the proportional distribution of ca, hca and ha among total bsis and by organism. methods: we systematically reviewed published literature from pubmed, uk department of health and us centers for disease control and prevention websites. findings: results from 23 studies and the websites highlighted the use of inconsistent criteria. there were 13 and  15 criteria variations for ca and ha bsi respectively, although a 48h cut-off for cultures sampled post admission was most commonly reported. five studies used variable clinical criteria to define hca. the mean proportion of paediatric ca bsi in nine studies was 50%. only four bsi organisms from five studies were predominantly ca (streptococcus pneumoniae, salmonella spp.) or ha (coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus spp.), whereas pseudomonas spp.,  klebsiella spp. and enterobacter spp. did not clearly fit into either category. conclusions: our study reveals inconsistent use of criteria, and a lack of evidence upon which to base them, to distinguish between ca, hca and ha bsi in children. criteria for ca, hca and ha bsi need to be developed using population-based studies that consider patients' clinical characteristics, recent healthcare exposure as well as isolated organism species.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the canward surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 canadian hospitals from january 2010 to december 2012. in total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method (document m07-a9, 2012), with mics interpreted by using clsi breakpoints (document m100-s23, 2013). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (mic90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, c. freundii, and h. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to clsi mic interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (p. mirabilis) to 54.0% (s. marcescens). all isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (mic90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity  against staphylococci or streptococci. all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.03 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and streptococcus agalactiae (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. we conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to  third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing e. coli and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == regional resistance surveillance program results for 12 asia-pacific nations (2011).
AB  == the regional resistance surveillance program monitored susceptibility rates and developing resistance by geographic region, including 12 asia-pacific (apac) countries. reference broth microdilution methods for susceptibility/interpretations were applied, processing 5,053 strains. among staphylococcus aureus isolates (37% methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa], highest in south korea [73%]), linezolid (lzd), tigecycline (tig), and vancomycin were 100% active, but 33 and 34% of strains were levofloxacin (lev) or macrolide  resistant, respectively. streptococcus pneumoniae was most resistant to beta-lactams and macrolides (45%) but was lzd, lev, and tig susceptible (>98%). extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) phenotype rates in escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. were 48 and 47%, respectively, and were highest in taiwan, at 75  to 91%. the best anti-esbl-phenotype agents were amikacin (81 to 96% susceptible), colistin (col; >98%), tig (>98%), and carbapenems (81 to 97%). pseudomonas aeruginosa showed >/=20% resistance to all drugs except col (99% susceptible). in conclusion, endemic evolving antimicrobial resistances in apac nations show compromised roles for many commonly used antimicrobials.

TI  == spectrum and potency of ceftaroline against leading pathogens causing community-acquired respiratory tract and skin and soft tissue infections in latin america, 2010.
AB  == ceftaroline, the active metabolite of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, is a cephalosporin with in vitro bactericidal activity against gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic and viridans group streptococci, and streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as common gram-negative organisms. in this study a total of 986 isolates collected in 2010 from patients in 15 medical centers in five latin  american countries from the assessing worldwide antimicrobial resistance evaluation program were identified as community-acquired respiratory tract or skin and soft tissue infection pathogens. ceftaroline was the most potent agent tested against s. pneumoniae with a mic90 value (0.12mug/ml) that was eight-fold  lower than ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and linezolid. its spectrum of coverage (100.0% susceptible) was similar to tigecycline, linezolid, levofloxacin and vancomycin. against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, ceftaroline was the most active agent tested. the activity of ceftaroline against s. aureus (including mrsa) was similar to that of vancomycin and tetracycline (mic90, 1mug/ml) and linezolid (mic90, 2mug/ml). the beta-haemolytic streptococci exhibited 100.0% susceptibility to ceftaroline. ceftaroline activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., and enterobacter spp. was similar to that of ceftriaxone and ceftazidime. these parenteral cephalosporin agents have potent activity against non-extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-phenotype strains, but are  not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-phenotype strains. these results confirm the in vitro activity of ceftaroline against pathogens common in  community-acquired respiratory tract and skin and soft tissue infection in latin  america, and suggest that ceftaroline fosamil could be an important therapeutic option for these infections.

TI  == evaluation of post-mortem heart blood culture in a chinese population.
AB  == background: post-mortem blood cultures have been used in a wide variety of research studies. however, their significance is still a matter of dispute among  medico-legal experts. this study was aimed to determine the factors which influenced post-mortem blood culture results and to assess their value in determining the cause of death. methods: we retrospectively investigated 76 post-mortem cases with suspected infection and correlated pathological findings with heart blood culture results. results: we found that survival time after onset of illness was significantly associated with positive heart blood cultures  (p=0.014). blood culture results were not influenced by age, gender, prior antibiotic therapy, interval time from death to store or interval time from death to autopsy (p>0.05). in those who had heart blood cultures taken, 49 cases (64.5%) including four cases with mixed growth, showed positive results, and approximately one-third of blood cultures were sterile. the positive predictive value (ppv) was 77.6% (38/49) including two cases with mixed growth; most were genuine pathogens according to the clinical and pathological findings. however, the negative predictive value (npv) was 59.3% (16/27). escherichia coli, streptococcus spp., staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and klebsiella spp. were isolated most often. conclusion: these findings suggest that the results of post-mortem heart blood cultures, when combined with clinical and  pathological findings, strengthen the understanding of the cause of death.

TI  == atypical pathogens causing community-acquired pneumonia in adults.
AB  == objective: to determine the frequency of community-acquired respiratory pathogens with special focus on atypical organisms in patients presenting to a tertiary care facility with community-acquired pneumonia (cap). methods: the descriptive study on adult patients was conducted from february 2007 to march 2008 at the aga khan university hospital, karachi. it comprised 124 consenting patients of age 16 and above who presentd with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. the diagnostic modalities used were based on significant changes in antibody titer or persisting high antibody titers in the case of mycoplasma pneumoniae and chalmydia pneumoniae infections, or bacterial antigen in urine, in the case of legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 infection. pyogenic bacteria were identified on the results of respiratory secretions or blood cultures. continuous data and categorical variables were worked out using spss version 15. results: among the 124 patients enrolled, an etiologic agent was identified in 44 (35.4%) patients.  the most common organism was mycoplasma pneumoniae (n = 21, 17%), followed by chlamydia pneumoniae (n = 15, 12%), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 9, 7%), haemophilus influenzae (n = 2, 1.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2, 1.6%) and staphylococcus aureus (n = 1, 0.8%). streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common organism isolated from blood cultures. no cases of legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 were identified. conclusions: mycoplasma pneumoniae and chalmydia pneumoniae are significant etiologic agents for community-acquired pneumonia occurring in karachi. local treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia should include therapy directed specifically at these agents.

TI  == role of interleukin 1 receptor like 1 (st2) in gram-negative and gram-positive sepsis in mice.
AB  == background: interleukin 1 receptor-like 1 (st2) has been implicated as a negative regulator of toll-like receptor signaling. we here sought to elucidate the role of st2 in cytokine release and systemic infection caused by two common human sepsis pathogens, streptococcus pneumoniae (gram-positive) and klebsiella pneumoniae (gram-negative). methods: whole blood leukocytes and splenocytes were  harvested from st2-deficient (st2) and wild-type (wt) mice and stimulated ex vivo with s. pneumoniae or k. pneumoniae. in addition, st2 and wt mice were infected intravenously with these bacteria, and bacterial loads and cytokine levels were measured in blood, spleens and lungs at 6, 24, and 48 h thereafter. results: unexpectedly, st2 blood leukocytes and splenocytes produced lower levels of cytokines and chemokines than wt cells in response to either pathogen. in contrast, the in vivo role of st2 during sepsis caused by these bacteria was limited, although at 6 and 24 h after infection with s. pneumoniae bacterial loads were lower in spleens of st2 mice. conclusions: st2 augments rather than inhibits cytokine release by blood leukocytes and splenocytes exposed to s. pneumoniae or k. pneumoniae, but plays a limited role in host defense during sepsis caused by these pathogens.

TI  == bacterial diversity in meconium of preterm neonates and evolution of their fecal  microbiota during the first month of life.
AB  == the establishment and succession of bacterial communities in infants may have a profound impact in their health, but information about the composition of meconium microbiota and its evolution in hospitalized preterm infants is scarce.  in this context, the objective of this work was to characterize the microbiota of meconium and fecal samples obtained during the first 3 weeks of life from 14 donors using culture and molecular techniques, including dgge and the human intestinal tract chip (hitchip) analysis of 16s rrna amplicons. culture techniques offer a quantification of cultivable bacteria and allow further study  of the isolate, while molecular techniques provide deeper information on bacterial diversity. culture and hitchip results were very similar but the former showed lower sensitivity. inter-individual differences were detected in the microbiota profiles although the meconium microbiota was peculiar and distinct from that of fecal samples. bacilli and other firmicutes were the main bacteria groups detected in meconium while proteobacteria dominated in the fecal samples.  culture technique showed that staphylococcus predominated in meconium and that enterococcus, together with gram-negative bacteria such as escherichia coli, escherichia fergusonii, klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia marcescens, was more abundant in fecal samples. in addition, hitchip results showed the prevalence of  bacteria related to lactobacillus plantarum and streptococcus mitis in meconium samples whereas those related to enterococcus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and yersinia predominated in the 3(rd) week feces. this study highlights that spontaneously-released meconium of preterm neonates contains a specific microbiota that differs from that of feces obtained after the first week of life. our findings indicate that the presence of serratia was strongly associated with a higher degree of immaturity and other hospital-related parameters, including antibiotherapy and mechanical ventilation.

TI  == pediatric bloodstream infections in cambodia, 2007 to 2011.
AB  == background: pediatric bacterial bloodstream infections (bsis) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. epidemiological data from resource-limited  settings in southeast asia, such as cambodia, are sparse but have important implications for treatment and public health strategies. methods: we retrospectively investigated bsi in children at a pediatric hospital and its satellite clinic in siem reap, cambodia, from january 1, 2007, to july 31, 2011.  the range of bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns  were analyzed in conjunction with demographic, clinical and outcome data. results: of 7682 blood cultures with results (99.9% of cultures taken), 606 (7.9%) episodes of bsi were identified in 588 children. the incidence of bsi increased from 14 to 50/1000 admissions (p < 0.001); this was associated with an  increased sampling rate. most bsi were community acquired (89.1%). common pathogens included salmonella typhi (22.8% of all isolates), staphylococcus aureus (12.2%), streptococcus pneumoniae (10.0%), klebsiella pneumoniae (6.4%) and escherichia coli (6.3%). 21.5% of bsi were caused by a diverse group of uncommon organisms, the majority of which were environmental gram-negative species. no listeria monocytogenes or group b streptococcal bsi were identified.  antimicrobial resistance, particularly among the enterobacteriaceae, was common.  overall mortality was substantial (19.0%), higher in neonates (36.9%) and independently associated with meningitis/meningoencephalitis and k. pneumoniae infection. conclusions: bsi is a common problem in cambodian children attending hospital and associated with significant mortality. further studies are needed to clarify the epidemiology of neonatal sepsis, the contribution of atypical organisms and the epidemiology of pneumococcal disease before the introduction of vaccine.

TI  == spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of common pathogenic bacteria isolated from patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in mainland of china.
AB  == background: bacteria-induced respiratory infection has been long considered to be the major cause of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (aecopd). therefore, a clear picture about the distribution and drug-resistance of pathogenic bacteria in the lower airways should be helpful for treatment of the disease. so far, data on this topic among chinese are lacking. methods: a surveillance study was performed in consecutive patients with aecopd at five areas in china between october 2006 and april 2008. the sputum from these patients was cultured and isolated for bacteria. agar dilution method was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of levofoxacin and other 15 antibiotics against these strains. results: three hundred and fifty-nine pathogenic bacterial strains were isolated among 884 patients with aecopd. the predominant bacteria were pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.7%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.3%), haemophilus influenzae (14.2%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (11.7%), followed by haemophilus parainfluenzae (9.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (7.8%), moraxella catarrhalis (6.4%) and escherichia coli (3.6%). the majority of bacterial pathogens isolated in this study were susceptible to fuoroquinolones, ceftazidime, cefepime and imipenem. conclusions: gram-negative bacilli are the leading pathogens in patients with aecopd in china. haemophilus parainfluenzae may be one of the most important pathogens in aecopd. this study provides evidence for local surveillance of aecopd pathogens and appropriate choice of antimicrobials in china.

TI  == comparison of the epidemiological behavior of mastitis pathogens by applying time-series analysis in results of milk samples submitted for microbiological examination.
AB  == the objective of this study is to examine and compare the trends of mastitis pathogens in quarter milk samples (n = 240,232) submitted for microbiological examination at the milk analysis laboratory (l.i.g.a.l.) at galicia, spain from june 2005 to september 2011. autoregressive integrated moving average (arima) models and multivariate statistical techniques such as cluster analysis were used in order to detect seasonal trends and similarities between the series trends and to classify mastitis pathogens into relatively homogeneous groups. the decrease of bulk milk somatic cell counts achieved by the mastitis control program, developed in recent years in this region, is the result of the decrease in imi caused by a limited number of mastitis pathogens. the obtained results reflect a  greater complexity in the behavior of mastitis pathogens, unlike the traditional  classification into contagious or environmental. staphylococcus aureus showed a trend similar to streptococcus dysgalactiae, a mastitis pathogen can behave in both a contagious and an environmental manner. among the traditionally considered environmental mastitis pathogens, strep. uberis showed a different behavior to escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) species and streptococcus other than strep. agalactiae showed differences in the trend model. time-series analysis and multivariate statistical techniques, such as cluster analysis, could be powerful tools to assess the isolation trend of mastitis pathogens because of their ability to cope with stochastic dependence of consecutive data. furthermore, they could be used to identify the epidemiological behavior of mastitis pathogens using the results of milk samples  submitted for routine microbiological examination, by classifying them into relatively homogeneous groups.

TI  == bacterial spectrum and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bloodstream infections in children with febrile neutropenia: experience of single center in southeast of turkey.
AB  == empirical antimicrobial therapy is usually started in febrile neutropenic patients without having culture results. the aim of this study was to help determine the policies of empirical antibiotic usage in febrile neutropenic children by detecting the antimicrobial susceptibility profile in this group of patients. in this study 811 blood cultures taken from neutropenic children hospitalized at the department of oncology of gaziantep children hospital november 2007 and february 2010 were retrospectively evaluated. blood cultures were routinely collected in aerobic and anaerobic media and incubated using the bactec system. identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the isolates to antimicrobial agents was performed using the vitek2((r)) system according to the recommendations of the clinical and laboratory standards institute. of 811 isolates analyzed, 128 (56.4%) were gram positive cocci, 43 (18.9%) were gram negative bacilli and fungi accounted for 56 (24.7%). the main isolated gram-positive bacteria from blood were coagulase-negative staphylococcus (56.7%), followed by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (14.1%). s. aureus and streptococcus spp. were all susceptible to linezolid, vancomycin and teicoplanin. s aureus was still susceptible to few other antimicrobial agents such as tetracycline (82.4%), chloramphenicol (55.6%). seven e. faecium, 7 e. fecalis and 1 e. hirae was isolated from blood cultures. vancomycin resistance was detected in 6 out of 15 (40%) enterococcus spp. isolates. among gram-negative bacteria e. coli (30.2%) was followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (20.9%) and proteus spp. (18.6%). imipenem (89.2%), meropenem (86.6%), chloramphenicol (88.9%), amicasin (82.4%) and fosfomycin (81.3%) showed highest susceptibility in vitro activity against all gram-negative isolates. to know the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of the pathogens frequently isolated from febrile neutropenic children and to consider this profile before starting an empirical antibiotic therapy would help the clinics which have any role in the treatment of these patients to determine the empirical antibiotic usage policies.

TI  == plant-based hydrocarbon esters from tragia involucrata possess antimicrobial and  anti-inflammatory activities.
AB  == antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of hydrocarbon esters obtained from tragia involucrata were evaluated by disk-diffusion (250 microg/ml), and broth-dilution (500-7.8 microg/ml), methods against bacteria. among the compounds, shellsol showed the most potent activity against burkholderia pseudomallei (khw), aeromonas hydrophila, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. interestingly, vinyl hexylether was active against food-spoilage bacteria (bacillus cereus and proteus vulgaris), 2, 4-methyl hexane also exerted antimicrobial activity against k. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, b. pseudomallei, alcaligens viscolactis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. 2-methylnonane  and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane showed only weak activity. for example, shellsol showed bacteriostatic effect (mic of 7.8 microg/ml) against a. hydrophila, vinyl hexylether (mic of 15.6 microg/ml) against p. mirabilis, and 2, 4-methyl hexane (mic of 31.25 microg/ml) on b. pseudomallei. cytotoxic effects of compounds were  assayed in human skin and monkey kidney cells (62.5-2000 microg/ml) by an xtt assay. the vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol did not show any toxicity up to 1000 microg/ml concentrations. the 2-methylnonane and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane induced morphological changes (e.g. cell disintegration and lysis) of both cell types at a 2000 microg/ml. the vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol were devoid of toxic effects; however, 2-methylnonane induced weight loss and severe necrosis as evidenced by histopathological and serum biochemical analysis in rats. interestingly, shellsol showed the maximum inhibition of carrageenan-induced, paw oedema in rats. in conclusion, findings of this study clearly indicate that biologically active hydrocarbon esters, such as shellsol, vinyl hexylether, and 2, 4-dimethyl hexane  isolated from t. involucrata, may effectively control the growth of certain food-borne and food-spoilage pathogens.

TI  == volatile metabolites of pathogens: a systematic review.
AB  == ideally, invading bacteria are detected as early as possible in critically ill patients: the strain of morbific pathogens is identified rapidly, and antimicrobial sensitivity is known well before the start of new antimicrobial therapy. bacteria have a distinct metabolism, part of which results in the production of bacteria-specific volatile organic compounds (vocs), which might be used for diagnostic purposes. volatile metabolites can be investigated directly in exhaled air, allowing for noninvasive monitoring. the aim of this review is to provide an overview of vocs produced by the six most abundant and pathogenic bacteria in sepsis, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli. such vocs could be used as biological markers in the diagnostic approach of critically ill patients. a systematic review of existing literature revealed 31 articles. all six bacteria of interest produce isopentanol, formaldehyde, methyl mercaptan, and trimethylamine. since humans do not produce these vocs, they could serve as biological markers for presence of these pathogens. the following volatile biomarkers were found for identification of specific strains: isovaleric acid and 2-methyl-butanal for staphylococcus aureus; 1-undecene, 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptane, 2-butanone, 4-methyl-quinazoline, hydrogen cyanide, and methyl thiocyanide for pseudomonas aeruginosa; and methanol, pentanol, ethyl acetate, and indole for escherichia coli. notably, several factors that may effect voc production were not controlled for, including used culture media, bacterial growth phase, and genomic variation within bacterial strains. in conclusion, vocs produced by bacteria may serve as biological markers for their presence. goal-targeted studies should be performed to identify potential sets of volatile biological markers and evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of these markers in critically ill patients.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity and physicochemical properties of a crude methanol extract of the larvae of the blow fly lucilia cuprina.
AB  == the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains has prompted the reintroduction of maggot therapy in the treatment of chronic, infected wounds. many previous studies have demonstrated the potent antibacterial activity of larval excretions/secretions of the blowfly lucilia sericata (meigen) (diptera:calliphoridae) against bacteria. however, the antibacterial activity of  its sibling species, lucilia cuprina (wiedemann) (diptera:calliphoridae) against  a wide range of pathogenic bacteria has never been determined. the aim of this study was to develop a new procedure to produce whole body extract of larvae of l. cuprina via methanol extraction as well as to demonstrate the in vitro antibacterial activity of this extract against seven selected wound pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli). the turbidimetric assay demonstrated that l. cuprina larval extract was significantly potent against all bacteria tested (p < 0.001). additionally, colony-forming unit (cfu), agar well diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration assays have confirmed the apparent potency of larval extract against p. aeruginosa. the reconstituted larval extract was highly robust and thermally stable. these observations substantiated the feasibility of the methanol extraction method in the production of larval extract.

TI  == secondary electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (sesi-ms) breathprinting of multiple bacterial lung pathogens, a mouse model study.
AB  == bacterial pneumonia is one of the leading causes of disease-related morbidity and mortality in the world, in part because the diagnostic tools for pneumonia are slow and ineffective. to improve the diagnosis success rates and treatment outcomes for bacterial lung infections, we are exploring the use of secondary electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (sesi-ms) breath analysis as a rapid, noninvasive method for determining the etiology of lung infections in situ. using a murine lung infection model, we demonstrate that sesi-ms breathprints can be used to distinguish mice that are infected with one of seven lung pathogens: haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, moraxella  catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae, representing the primary causes of bacterial pneumonia worldwide. after applying principal components analysis, we observed that with the first three principal components (primarily comprised of data from 14 peaks), all infections were separable via sesi-ms breathprinting (p < 0.0001). therefore, we  have shown the potential of this sesi-ms approach for rapidly detecting and identifying acute bacterial lung infections in situ via breath analysis.

TI  == late respiratory infection after lung transplantation.
AB  == background: aiming to improve outcome of lung transplantation (ltx) patients, we  reviewed risk factors and treatment practices for the ltx recipients who experienced respiratory infection in the late post-ltx period (>1 month after ltx). methods: we analyzed the clinical data of 48 recipients and donors from 61  ltx, who experienced late respiratory infections. late respiratory infections were classified according to the etiology, time of occurrence, and frequency of donor-to-host transmission or colonization of the recipient prior to transplantation. results: during the period of observation, 42 episodes of respiratory infections occurred. the organisms most frequently involved were gram (-) bacteria: acinetobacter baumannii (n=13, 31.0%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=7, 16.7%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (n=4, 10.0%). among the 42 episodes recorded, 14 occurred in the late post-ltx period. these were bacterial (n=6, 42.9%), fungal (n=2, 14.3%), viral (n=4, 28.5%), and mycobacterial (n=2, 14.3%) infections. of 6 bacterial infections, 2 were from multidrug-resistant (mdr) a. baumannii and one from each of mdr p. aeruginosa, extended spectrum beta-lactamase (+) k. pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. infection-related death occurred in 6 of the 14 episodes (43%). conclusion: although the frequency of respiratory infection decreased sharply in the late post-ltx period, respiratory infection was still a  major cause of mortality. gram (-) mdr bacteria were the agents most commonly identified in these infections.

TI  == spectrum and potency of ceftaroline tested against leading pathogens causing skin and soft-tissue infections in europe (2010).
AB  == ceftaroline, the active metabolite of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, is a novel cephalosporin exhibiting bactericidal activity in vitro against gram-positive organisms, including meticillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), meticillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), beta-haemolytic streptococci, viridans group streptococci (vgs) and streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as against many common gram-negative organisms. the objective of this study was to determine the  spectrum and potency of ceftaroline against recent (2010) leading pathogens causing complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (csstis) isolated in europe.  a total of 2438 isolates from the assessing worldwide antimicrobial resistance and evaluation (aware) programme were identified as cssti pathogens. isolates were collected from patients in 52 medical centres in 19 european countries. reference susceptibility testing for ceftaroline and commonly used antimicrobials was performed by broth microdilution methodologies. ceftaroline was very active overall against s. aureus (mic(50/90)=0.25/1 mg/l) and inhibited 100.0% of isolates at a mic of </=2 mg/l. activity against mrsa was documented (mic(50/90)=1/2 mg/l) but was lower than that observed against mssa (mic(50/90)=0.25/0.25 mg/l). ceftaroline was also very active against 460 beta-haemolytic streptococci and 93 vgs (mic(90)=0.015 mg/l and 0.06 mg/l, respectively). ceftaroline was active against escherichia coli (mic(50)=0.12 mg/l) and klebsiella pneumoniae (mic(50)=0.06 mg/l) not expressing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, with activity similar to ceftriaxone and ceftazidime. in summary, this study documents the potent in vitro activity of ceftaroline when tested against recent pathogens isolated from patients with cssti in europe.

TI  == serum adhesion molecules as predictors of bacteremia in adult severe sepsis patients at the emergency department.
AB  == background: bacteremia is a severe bacterial infection with significant mortality. clinical parameters that reliably predict it are less elucidated. we assessed the potential of serum adhesion molecules for predicting bacteremia and  compare it with current available infection biomarkers to determine a more timely predictor of adult severe sepsis patients on admission to the emergency department (ed). methods: sixty-seven consecutive non-traumatic, non-surgical adult patients with severe sepsis admitted to the ed were evaluated. serum samples were collected and assessed while serum adhesion molecules were analyzed. results: thirty-one (46.2%) study patients had bacteremia. there were significant differences in both sicam-1 and se-selectin on admission between bacteremic and non-bacteremic patients. by stepwise logistic regression model, only se-selectin  was independently associated with bacteremia and any 1 ng/ml increase in level increased bacteremia rate by 0.8%. the cut-off value of se-selectin level for predicting bacteremia was 117 ng/ml (84% sensitivity and 69% specificity). conclusion: although serum cell adhesion markers are not specific for predicting  bacteremia in septic patients, higher mean serum cell adhesion molecules levels on admission may imply both more severe infection and presence of bacteremia. assay of serum adhesion molecules may be added as an infectious marker among the  panel of bacteremic parameters in clinical practice, especially since early diagnosis and prompt antimicrobial therapy are essentially for survival.

TI  == predictors of viral pneumonia: the need for viral testing in all patients hospitalized for nursing home-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == aim: community-acquired pneumonia (cap) is presumed to be bacterial in origin and empirical antibiotics are almost always given on admission. however, early detection of viral infection is also very important for hospital infection control and timely use of antiviral agents. the present study aimed to compare patients with viral and bacterial pneumonia, and identify independent predictors  of viral pneumonia. methods: a prospective cohort study was carried out in a tertiary teaching hospital in a 1-year period. older patients (aged >/= 65 years) were recruited if they were admitted for cap confirmed by chest radiographs. results: a cohort of 488 patients was analyzed. infective causes were found in 137 (28.1%) patients. bacterial, viral and mixed infections were detected in 86 (17.6%), 41 (8.4%) and 10 (2.0%) patients, respectively. bacteriology was established mostly by sputum culture and virology by nasopharyngeal aspirate (npa) viral culture. the commonest bacterial isolates were haemophilus influenzae (31), pseudomonas aeruginosa (15), mycobacterium tuberculosis (14), klebsiella spp. (9) and streptococcus pneumoniae (6). influenza a virus (28, 8 were pandemic 2009 a/h1n1 subtype) and respiratory syncytial virus (16) were the most frequent  viral causes. independent predictors of viral pneumonia included nursing home residence (rr 3.056, p = 0.009) and absence of leukocytosis (rr 0.425, p = 0.026). conclusions: all nursing home residents hospitalized for cap should undergo npa viral testing because of infection control, early antiviral treatment and discharge planning. we suggest that empirical antiviral agents might be considered for nursing home residents hospitalized for cap if outbreaks of influenza-like illness are reported in nursing homes.

TI  == bacteria can promote calcium oxalate crystal growth and aggregation.
AB  == our previous report showed that uropathogenic bacteria, e.g., escherichia coli, are commonly found inside the nidus of calcium oxalate (caox) kidney stones and may play pivotal roles in stone genesis. the present study aimed to prove this new hypothesis by direct examining caox lithogenic activities of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. caox was crystallized in the absence (blank control) or presence of 10(5) cfu/ml e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, or streptococcus pneumoniae. fragmented red blood cell membranes and intact red blood cells were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. the crystal area and the number of aggregates were measured to initially screen for effects of bacteria on caox crystal growth and aggregation.  the data revealed that all the bacteria tested dramatically increased the crystal area and number of crystal aggregates. validation assays (spectrophotometric oxalate-depletion assay and an aggregation-sedimentation study) confirmed their promoting effects on both growth (20.17 +/- 3.42, 17.55 +/- 2.27, 16.37 +/- 1.38, and 21.87 +/- 0.85 % increase, respectively) and aggregation (57.45 +/- 2.08, 51.06 +/- 5.51, 55.32 +/- 2.08, and 46.81 +/- 3.61 % increase, respectively) of caox crystals. also, these bacteria significantly enlarged caox aggregates, with  the diameter greater than the luminal size of distal tubules, implying that tubular occlusion might occur. moreover, these bacterial effects were dose-dependent and specific to intact viable bacteria, not intact dead or fragmented bacteria. in summary, intact viable e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. aureus, and s. pneumoniae had significant promoting effects on caox crystal growth and aggregation. this functional evidence supported the hypothesis that various types of bacteria can induce or aggravate metabolic stone disease, particularly the caox type.

TI  == a five-year review of necrotising fasciitis in a tertiary referral unit.
AB  == introduction: necrotising fasciitis is a life-threatening illness that is often difficult to diagnose. immediate debridement and intravenous antibiotic therapy are required to limit the spread of infection. this five-year audit aimed to review the number and outcomes of all cases of necrotising fasciitis admitted to  a tertiary referral unit and to assess the validity of the laboratory risk indicator for necrotising fasciitis (lrinec) scoring system. methods: a retrospective analysis of patient notes over the five-year period from october 2006 to october 2011 was undertaken. the lrinec score was calculated for each patient to evaluate its usefulness. results: overall, 15 patients were diagnosed  with necrotising fasciitis. three patients died. the median age of patients was 51.0 years (range: 34-76 years). there were no obvious predisposing factors in 8  cases but patients had a median of 2.0 co-morbidities. the most common infective  agent, present in five patients, was group a streptococcus. other monomicrobial agents included group g streptococcus and klebsiella pneumoniae. polymicrobial infections were less common than mono-microbial infections and two patients had a polymicrobial infection including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. although the lrinec scoring system identified 12 of the 15 patients as having a high or intermediate likelihood of necrotising fasciitis, 3 were classified as low likelihood. conclusions: this limited case series strongly suggests that the  lrinec system is too insensitive for diagnosis.

TI  == streptococcus pseudopneumoniae: an emerging respiratory tract pathogen.
AB  == background & objectives: streptococcus pseudopneumoniae a member of the viridans  streptococci, is known to be associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and respiratory tract infections (rti). very scanty information is available on the isolation of s. pseudopneumoniae from india. hence, the present  study was an attempt to isolate s. pseudopneumoniae from clinical samples and to  study their drug resistance pattern. methods: sputum samples (n=150) submitted to the microbiology laboratory for routine culture from patients clinically suspected to have lower respiratory tract infection were inoculated onto sheep blood agar and chocolate agar plates. alpha haemolytic colonies were identified as s. pseudopneumoniae based on absence of capsule, bile solubility and optochin  susceptibility in 5 per cent co(2) and ambient air. disk diffusion method was used for antibiotic susceptibilily testing. results: among the samples screened,  4 per cent showed the growth of only s. pseudopneumoniae. other pathogens isolated were streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, klebsiella spp., enterococcus spp., pseudomonas spp., haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans. all the s. pseudopneumoniae isolates were resistant to  erythromycin. interpretation & conclusions: our preliminary results showed presence of s. pseudopneumoniae in this part of the country and these were associated with rti. currently, most clinical laboratories report optochin susceptible isolates in 5 per cent co(2) as s. pneumoniae and the resistant ones  are not further tested for susceptibility in ambient air. as a result, s. pseudopneumoniae may be missed out. hence, performance of at least two tests, viz. optochin susceptibility with incubation in 5 per cent co(2) and ambient air  along with bile solubility is necessary to differentiate s. pneumoniae from s. pseudopneumoniae.

TI  == antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of cerebrospinal fluid (csf) isolates in namibia: implications for empirical antibiotic treatment of meningitis.
AB  == objective: bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency associated with high mortality rates. cerebrospinal fluid (csf) culture is the "gold standard" for diagnosis of meningitis and it is important to establish the susceptibility of the causative microorganism to rationalize treatment. the namibia standard treatment guidelines (stgs) recommends initiation of empirical antibiotic treatment in patients with signs and symptoms of meningitis after taking a csf sample for culture and sensitivity. the objective of this study was to assess the antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of microorganisms isolated from csf to antibiotics commonly used in the empirical treatment of suspected bacterial meningitis in namibia. methods: this was a cross-sectional descriptive study of routinely collected antibiotic susceptibility data from the namibia institute of  pathology (nip) database. results of csf culture and sensitivity from january 1,  2009 to may 31, 2012, from 33 state hospitals throughout namibia were analysed. results: the most common pathogens isolated were streptococcus species, neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus, and escherichia coli. the common isolates from csf showed high resistance (34.3% -73.5%) to penicillin. over one third (34.3%) of streptococcus were resistance to penicillin which was higher than 24.8% resistance in the united states. meningococci were susceptible  to several antimicrobial agents including penicillin. the sensitivity to cephalosporins remained high for streptococcus, neisseria, e. coli and haemophilus. the highest percentage of resistance to cephalosporins was seen among esbl k. pneumoniae (n = 7, 71%-100%), other klebsiella species (n = 7, 28%-80%), and staphylococcus (n = 36, 25%-40%). conclusions: the common organisms isolated from csf were streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus, and e. coli. all common organisms isolated from csf showed high sensitivity to cephalosporins used in the empirical treatment of meningitis. the resistance of the common isolates to penicillin is high. most esbl k. pneumoniae were isolated from csf samples drawn from neonates  and were found to be resistant to the antibiotics recommended in the namibia stgs. based on the above findings, it is recommended to use a combination of aminoglycoside and third-generation cephalosporin to treat non-esbl klebsiella isolates. carbapenems (e.g., meropenem) and piperacillin/tazobactam should be considered for treating severely ill patients with suspected esbl klebsiella infection. namibia should have a national antimicrobial resistance surveillance system for early detection of antibiotics that may no longer be effective in treating meningitis and other life-threatening infections due to resistance.

TI  == no change in antibiotic susceptibility patterns in the neonatal icu over two decades.
AB  == objectives: to identify trends in early-onset sepsis and late-onset sepsis neonatal rates and to evaluate the appropriateness of the empirical antibiotic protocols. design: a 17-yr (1993-2009) analysis of positive blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures. setting: the two neonatal icus at the hadassah- hebrew university medical center. results: during this period, 991 infants had at least one episode of either bacteremia or meningitis. the overall incidence of early-onset sepsis was 0.64 per 1,000 live births with a nonsignificant trend over the study period (p = 0.37). the overall incidence of late-onset sepsis was  7.5 per 100 admissions with a significant positive trend in the incidence rates (p = 0.021). the incidence of late-onset sepsis was 7.5 per 100 admissions with a significant positive trend in the prevalence rates (p = 0.021). the prevalence of early-onset group b streptococcus bacteremia decreased significantly throughout the study period. among late-onset sepsis, gram-positive and fungi infection rates were stable over time, while gram-negative infection rates showed a significant positive trend (p = 0.007). no significant change in the susceptibility rate of the isolated gram-negative bacteria in late-onset sepsis for the common antibacterial drugs was found. about 85% and 90% of the isolated organisms were susceptible to our early-onset sepsis (ampicillin and gentamicin)  and late-onset sepsis (vancomycin and cefotaxime) protocols, respectively, and these rates were stable over the study period (p = .1 and .55, respectively). sepsis-related mortality was higher among gram- negative sepsis cases resistant to our empiric antibiotic protocol. conclusions: our empiric antibiotic protocols are appropriate despite their continuous use over the last 17 yrs. this may have  been achieved by the use of a controlled antibiotic program and infection control efforts.

TI  == bacteriology of acute appendicitis and its implication for the use of prophylactic antibiotics.
AB  == background: to prevent surgical site infection (ssi) after appendectomy, antibiotic prophylaxis has been recommended for all patients, but this approach is based largely on bacteriologic findings that are decades old. the objective of this study was to reevaluate the bacteriology of acute appendicitis in order to assess the usefulness of current antibiotic prophylaxis. methods: between january 1 and december 31, 2010, 117 patients with pathology-proved acute appendicitis were recruited. antibiotic prophylaxis was given according to national guidelines. immediately after operation, the luminal contents of the appendices were swabbed for bacterial culture. the charts of the patients were surveyed retrospectively for postoperative complications until june 30, 2011. results: bacteria were isolated from 115 of 117 specimens sent for culture (98%). of the 115 samples that yielded bacteria, all gave rise to aerobic isolates and five yielded mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates. the most common aerobic organism was escherichia coli, which was present in 100 of 117 patients who had pathology-proved acute appendicitis (85%). less frequent organisms were klebsiella pneumoniae (30 cases; 26%), streptococcus spp. (29 cases; 25%), enterococcus spp. (21 cases; 18%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (18 cases; 15%). all p. aeruginosa isolates were sensitive to amikacin, ceftazidime, and cefepime; but seven of the eight were resistant to cefuroxime. eight patients were identified as having had a postoperative ssi, and p. aeruginosa was isolated from five of these cases. the isolation of p. aeruginosa correlated significantly with ssi (p=0.002). conclusions: the most commonly identified aerobic bacteria associated with acute appendicitis were e. coli, followed by k. pneumoniae, streptococcus, enterococcus, and p. aeruginosa. pseudomonas aeruginosa frequently was not covered by the prophylactic antibiotics chosen and might be associated with ssi.

TI  == a reflection on bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents at a major tertiary  care center in lebanon over a decade.
AB  == background: antimicrobial resistance has been inflecting deleterious health and economic consequences locally and globally. this study addresses the patterns and trends of bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents over a decade, at a major  tertiary care center in beirut. methods: data on bacterial susceptibility patterns at the cap accredited clinical microbiology laboratory is analyzed from  january 2000 to november 2011, along with related different studies conducted during this period. results: increasing rates of esbl-producing isolates were noted for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. resistance to carbapenems remains problematic in acinetobacter spp, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and started emerging in e. coli and k. pneumoniae. tigecycline and colistin maintained excellent activity against most esbl and carbapenem resistant bacteria relevant to the treatment by these agents. resistance to quinolones is being encountered in streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), though remaining relatively high, showed decreasing trends of resistance, while vancomycin maintain uniform activity. rare and sporadic vancomycin resistant strains in enterococci are encountered. macrolide and clindamycin increasing rates of resistance is noted in s. pneumoniae, group a streptococci, s. aureus, viridans streptococci and some others. conclusion: physicians should be aware of the local epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance  to properly guide the initial therapy. these resistance problems can be attributed to uncontrolled use of antimicrobial agents, thus, highlighting the need for antimicrobial stewardship to curb this threat.

TI  == aetiology of community-acquired neonatal sepsis in low and middle income countries.
AB  == background: 99% of the approximate 1 million annual neonatal deaths from life-threatening invasive bacterial infections occur in developing countries, at  least 50% of which are from home births or community settings. data concerning aetiology of sepsis in these settings are necessary to inform targeted therapy and devise management guidelines. this review describes and analyses the bacterial aetiology of community-acquired neonatal sepsis in developing countries. methods: a search of medline, embase, global health and web of knowledge, limited to post-1980, found 27 relevant studies. data on aetiology were extracted, tabulated and analysed along with data on incidence, risk factors, case fatality rates and antimicrobial sensitivity. results: the most prevalent pathogens overall were staphylococcus aureus (14.9%), escherichia coli  (12.2%), and klebsiella species (11.6%). however, variations were observed both between global regions and age-of-onset categories. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae were most prevalent in africa, while klebsiella was highly prevalent in south-east asia. a notably higher prevalence of group b streptococcus was present in neonates aged 7 days or less. the highest case fatality rates were recorded in south-east asia. klebsiella species showed highest antimicrobial resistance. conclusion: data on community-acquired neonatal sepsis in developing countries are limited. future research should focus on areas of high disease burden with relative paucity of data. research into maternal and  neonatal vaccination strategies and improved diagnostics is also needed. all of this could contribute to the formulation of community-based care packages, the implementation of which has significant potential to lower overall neonatal mortality and hence advance progress towards the attainment of millennium development goal 4.

TI  == [in vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,866 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2010].
AB  == postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (lvfx) has been conducted continuously since 1992. the present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in japan to 30 selected antibacterial  agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (fqs). the common respiratory pathogens streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to fqs. in contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among s pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. regarding h. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to fqs, however, prevalence of lvfx-resistant escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of lvfx-resistant e. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence  of lvfx 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. another enterobacteriaceae member, klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to fqs, in contrast with e.  coli. in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), the percentage of fq-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other fqs. however, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) isolates were highly susceptible to fqs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. the prevalence of fqs-resistant  isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of fq-resistance in mrsa. the prevalence of fqs-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (utis) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in p. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (rtis). while this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were  noted in the prevalence of fq-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates derived from utis. the prevalence of multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from utis and 0.3% among isolates from rtis, a decrease from the results  of 2007. acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to fqs. imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a  prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance  of 81.3-82.5%, to fqs. ceftriaxone (ctrx) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to ctrx in some clinical isolates. the result of the present survey indicated that although  methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococcus faecium, p. aeruginosa from utis, n. gonorrhoeae, and e. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the fqs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. while fq resistance has been prevailing in e. coli, e. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to fqs. the other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against fqs.

AB  == sm-295291 and sm-369926 are new parenteral 2-aryl carbapenems with strong activity against major causative pathogens of community-acquired infections such  as methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant strains), streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant strains), and neisseria gonorrhoeae (including ciprofloxacin-resistant strains), with mic(90)s of </= 1 mug/ml. unlike tebipenem (mic(50), 8 mug/ml), sm-295291 and sm-369926 had no activity against hospital pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic(50), >/=  128 mug/ml). the bactericidal activities of sm-295291 and sm-369926 against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren. the therapeutic efficacies of intravenous administrations of sm-295291 and sm-369926 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren, respectively, reflecting their in vitro activities. sm-295291 and sm-369926 showed intravenous  pharmacokinetics similar to those of meropenem in terms of half-life in monkeys (0.4 h) and were stable against human dehydropeptidase i. sm-368589 and sm-375769, which are medoxomil esters of sm-295291 and sm-369926, respectively, showed good oral bioavailability in rats, dogs, and monkeys (4.2 to 62.3%). thus, 2-aryl carbapenems are promising candidates that show an ideal broad spectrum for the treatment of community-acquired infections, including infections caused by penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae, have low selective pressure on antipseudomonal carbapenem-resistant nosocomial pathogens, and allow parenteral,  oral, and switch therapies.

TI  == community-acquired neonatal and infant sepsis in developing countries: efficacy of who's currently recommended antibiotics--systematic review and meta-analysis.
AB  == objective: to review the aetiology and antibiotic resistance patterns of community-acquired sepsis in developing countries in infants where no clear focus of infection is clinically identified. to estimate the likely efficacy of who's recommended treatment for infant sepsis. design: a systematic review of the literature describing the aetiology of community-acquired neonatal and infant sepsis in developing countries. using meta-analytical methods, susceptibility was determined to the antibiotic combinations recommended by who: (1) benzylpenicillin/ampicillin and gentamicin, (2) chloramphenicol and benzylpenicillin, and (3) third-generation cephalosporins. results: 19 studies were identified from 13 countries, with over 4000 blood culture isolates. among neonates, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli accounted for 55% (39-70%) of culture positive sepsis on weighted prevalence. in infants outside the neonatal period, the most prevalent pathogens were s aureus, e coli,  klebsiella spp., streptococcus pneumoniae and salmonella spp., which accounted for 59% (26-92%) of culture positive sepsis. for neonates, penicillin/gentamicin  had comparable in vitro coverage to third-generation cephalosporins (57% vs. 56%). in older infants (1-12 months), in vitro susceptibility to penicillin/gentamicin, chloramphenicol/penicillin and third-generation cephalosporins was 63%, 47% and 64%, respectively. conclusions: the high rate of  community-acquired resistant sepsis-especially that caused by klebsiella spp. and s aureus-is a serious global public health concern. in vitro susceptibility data  suggest that third-generation cephalosporins are not more effective in treating sepsis than the currently recommended antibiotics, benzylpenicillin and gentamicin; however, with either regimen a significant proportion of bacteraemia  is not covered. revised recommendations for effective second-line antibiotics in  neonatal and infant sepsis in developing countries are urgently needed.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == immunity to the conserved influenza nucleoprotein reduces susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections.
AB  == influenza causes >250,000 deaths annually in the industrialized world, and bacterial infections frequently cause secondary illnesses during influenza outbreaks, including pneumonia, bronchitis, sinusitis, and otitis media. in this  study, we demonstrate that cross-reactive immunity to mismatched influenza strains can reduce susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections, even though  this fails to prevent influenza infection. specifically, infecting mice with h3n2 influenza before challenging with mismatched h1n1 influenza reduces susceptibility to either gram-positive streptococcus pneumoniae or gram-negative  klebsiella pneumoniae. vaccinating mice with the highly conserved nucleoprotein of influenza also reduces h1n1-induced susceptibility to lethal bacterial infections. both t cells and abs contribute to defense against influenza-induced  bacterial diseases; influenza cross-reactive t cells reduce viral titers, whereas abs to nucleoprotein suppress induction of inflammation in the lung. these findings suggest that nonneutralizing influenza vaccines that fail to prevent influenza infection may nevertheless protect the public from secondary bacterial  diseases when neutralizing vaccines are not available.

TI  == structure of a udp-glucose dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon pyrobaculum islandicum.
AB  == the crystal structure of an extremely thermostable udp-glucose dehydrogenase (udp-gdh) from the hyperthermophilic archaeon pyrobaculum islandicum was determined at a resolution of 2.0 a. the overall fold was comprised of an n-terminal nad(+) dinucleotide binding domain and a c-terminal udp-sugar binding  domain connected by a long alpha-helix, and the main-chain coordinates of the enzyme were similar to those of previously studied udp-gdhs, including the enzymes from burkholderia cepacia, streptococcus pyogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae. however, the sizes of several surface loops in p. islandicum udp-gdh  were much smaller than the corresponding loops in b. cepacia udp-gdh but were comparable to those of the s. pyogenes and k. pneumoniae enzymes. structural comparison revealed that the presence of extensive intersubunit hydrophobic interactions, as well as the formation of an intersubunit aromatic pair network,  is likely to be the main factor contributing to the hyperthermostability of p. islandicum udp-gdh.

TI  == comparative study of nasal bacterial carriage in pediatric patients from two different geographical regions.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial carriage in the anterior nares of two different patient cohorts, aged 5-15 years. by use of a sensitive enrichment broth, gram-positive and -negative bacteria were cultured from the two cohorts of each 100 patients at the referral clinic in eritrea and at a german university hospital. in the german cohort, 27% of the patients were positive either for gram-negative (n=5) or -positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus (n=8; mrsa (n=2)), staphylococcus epidermidis (n=12), corynebacterium spp. (n=4), and streptococcus pyogenes (n=1). in comparison, the  eritrean cohort revealed 33% bacterial carriers in the anterior nares. among the  identified species were s. aureus (n=2), s. epidermidis (n=13), streptococcus haemolyticus (n=9), and gram-negative rods including klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca (n=5), enterobacter agglomerans (n=4), escherichia coli (n=2), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1). noteworthy, none of the eritrean patients were  positive for mrsa. in both cohorts there was no co-occurrence of gram-positive and -negative bacteria in the anterior nares. however, we observed in two subjects of the eritrean cohort co-colonization with s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus. the occurrence of gram-negative bacteria was less significant by age in the german cohort, whereas in the eritrean cohort gram-negative bacteria were more frequently detected in carriers aged 5-9 years. continued surveillance  of s. aureus and gram-negative bacteria carriage deserves further attention and might help to determine future trends in the characteristics of nasal carriage, subsequent incidence of infections, and the potential effectiveness of targeted population based intervention.

TI  == [necrotizing pneumonia - a rare complication].
AB  == necrotizing pneumonia is a rare complication of community-acquired pneumonia associated with destruction of the lung tissue during the infection and rise of necrotic foci in consolidated areas. staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, nocardia, klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus pneumoniae are the most common causative agents. risk factors for developing necrotizing pneumonia include smoking, alcoholism, old age, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung diseases or liver disease. diagnosis of necrotizing pneumonia requires supportive care, use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and monitoring for sepsis and respiratory failure.  hemoptysis, abscess, empyema and gangrene are possible complications and surgical intervention may be required. the authors present a clinical case of pneumococcal necrotizing pneumonia in a patient without important risk factors and favourable  progression with medical therapy. in this regard, a brief bibliographic review about this pathology is also made.

TI  == maternal hiv infection and vertical transmission of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: hiv-exposed newborns may be at higher risk of sepsis because of immune system aberrations, impaired maternal antibody transfer and altered exposure to pathogenic bacteria. methods: we performed a secondary analysis of a  study (clinicaltrials.gov, number nct00136370) conducted between april 2004 and october 2007 in south africa. we used propensity score matching to evaluate the association between maternal hiv infection and (1) vaginal colonization with bacterial pathogens; (2) vertical transmission of pathogens to the newborn; and (3) sepsis within 3 days of birth (eos) or between 4-28 days of life (los). results: colonization with group b streptococcus (17% vs 23%, p = .0002), escherichia coli (47% vs 45%, p = .374), and klebsiella pneumoniae (7% vs 10%, p  = .008) differed modestly between hiv-infected and uninfected women, as did vertical transmission rates. maternal hiv infection was not associated with increased risk of neonatal eos or los, although culture-confirmed eos was >3 times higher among hiv-exposed infants (p = .05). when compared with hiv-unexposed, neonates, hiv-exposed, uninfected neonates (heu) had a lower risk  of eos (20.6 vs 33.7 per 1000 births; p = .046) and similar rate of los (5.8 vs 4.1; p = .563). hiv-infected newborns had a higher risk than heu of eos (134 vs 21.5; p < .0001) and los (26.8 vs 5.6; p = .042). conclusions: maternal hiv infection was not associated with increased risk of maternal bacterial colonization, vertical transmission, eos, or los. hiv-infected neonates, however, were at increased risk of eos and los.

TI  == epidemiology, aetiology and management of childhood acute community-acquired pneumonia in developing countries--a review.
AB  == childhood acute community-acquired pneumonia is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. in children who have not received prior antibiotic therapy, the main bacterial causes of clinical pneumonia in developing countries are streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae type b (hib), and the main viral cause is respiratory syncytial virus  (rsv), but estimates of their relative importance vary in different settings. the only vaccines for the prevention of bacterial pneumonia (excluding vaccines for pertussis and measles) are hib and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (pcv). in children with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection, bacterial infection remains a major cause of pneumonia mortality; however, pneumocystis jirovecii and mycobacterium tuberculosis are important causes of pneumonia in them. studies of  bacterial aetiology of acute pneumonia in severely malnourished children have implicated klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and h. influenzae, with very few data on the role of respiratory viruses and tuberculosis. studies of neonatal sepsis suggest that gram-negative enteric organisms, particularly klebsiella spp., and gram-positive  organisms, mainly pneumococcus, group b streptococcus and s. aureus are causes of neonatal pneumonia. many of the developing countries that ranked high in pneumonia mortality are preparing to introduce new pneumonia vaccines with support from global alliance for vaccine and immunization (gavi alliance), plan for the expansion of community-based case management and have ambitious plans for strengthening health systems. assurance that these plans are implemented will require funding and continued public attention to pneumonia, which will help contribute to a substantial decline in childhood pneumonia deaths.

AB  == peptide deformylase (pdf) catalyzes the removal of the formyl group from the n-terminal methionine residue in newly synthesized polypeptides, which is an essential process in bacteria. four new inhibitors of pdf that belong to two different classes, hydroxamate/pseudopeptide compounds [pmt387 (7a) and pmt497] and reverse-hydroxamate/nonpeptide compounds [pmt1039 (15e) and pmt1067], have been developed. these compounds inhibited the growth of several pathogens involved in respiratory-tract infections, such as streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae, and leading nosocomial pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae with a minimum  inhibitory concentration (mic) in the range 0.1-0.8 mg ml(-1). interestingly, the reverse-hydroxamate/nonpeptide compounds showed a 250-fold higher antimicrobial activity towards s. aureus, although the four compounds showed similar k(i) values against s. aureus pdf enzymes, with k(i) values in the 11-85 nm range. to  provide a structural basis for the discovery of additional pdf inhibitors, the crystal structures of s. aureus pdf in complex with the four inhibitors were determined at resolutions of 1.90-2.30 a. the inhibitor-bound structures displayed distinct deviations depending on the inhibitor class. the distance between the zn(2+) ion and the carbonyl o atom of the hydroxamate inhibitors (or  the hydroxyl o atom of the reverse-hydroxamate inhibitors) appears to be correlated to s. aureus inhibition activity. the structural information reported  in this study should aid in the discovery of new pdf inhibitors that can be used  as novel antibacterial drugs.

TI  == chemical composition of 8 eucalyptus species' essential oils and the evaluation of their antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities.
AB  == background: in 1957, tunisia introduced 117 species of eucalyptus; they have been used as fire wood, for the production of mine wood and to fight erosion. actually, eucalyptus essential oil is traditionally used to treat respiratory tract disorders such as pharyngitis, bronchitis, and sinusitis. a few investigations were reported on the biological activities of eucalyptus oils worldwide. in tunisia, our previous works conducted in 2010 and 2011 had been the first reports to study the antibacterial activities against reference strains. at that time it was not possible to evaluate their antimicrobial activities against  clinical bacterial strains and other pathogens such as virus and fungi. methods:  the essential oils of eight eucalyptus species harvested from the jbel abderrahman, korbous (north east tunisia) and souinet arboreta (north of tunisia) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities by disc diffusion and microbroth dilution methods against seven bacterial isolates: haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. in addition, the bactericidal, fungicidal and the antiviral activities of the tested oils were carried out. results: twenty five components were identified by gc/fid  and gc/ms. these components were used to correlate with the biological activities of the tested oils. the chemical principal component analysis identified three groups, each of them constituted a chemotype. according to the values of zone diameter and percentage of the inhibition (zdi, % i, respectively), four groups and subgroups of bacterial strains and three groups of fungal strains were characterized by their sensitivity levels to eucalyptus oils. the cytotoxic effect and the antiviral activity varied significantly within eucalyptus species  oils. conclusions: e. odorata showed the strongest activity against s. aureus, h. influenzae, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae and against all the tested  fungal strains. in addition, e. odorata oil showed the most cytotoxic effect. however, the best antiviral activity appeared with e. bicostata. virus pretreatment with e. bicostata essential oil showed better antiviral activity (ic(50) = 0.7 mg/ml, si = 22.8) than cell-pretreatment (ic(50) = 4.8 mg/ml, si =  3.33). the essential oil of e. astringens showed antiviral activity only when incubated with virus prior to cell infection. this activity was dose-dependent and the antiviral activity diminished with the decreasing essential oil concentration.

TI  == recent trend of necrotizing fasciitis in taiwan: focus on monomicrobial klebsiella pneumoniae necrotizing fasciitis.
AB  == background: necrotizing fasciitis (nf) is a rapidly progressive, life-threatening soft-tissue infection that is traditionally caused by group a streptococcus (gas) or mixed aerobic/anaerobic bacteria. monomicrobial klebsiella pneumoniae nf (kp-nf) has been reported since 1996 but has not yet been systematically studied. methods: we retrospectively studied consecutive nf cases treated at a university  hospital in taiwan during 1997-2010 and investigated the clinical characteristics and outcomes associated with monomicrobial kp-nf, using monomicrobial gas-nf as a reference. we also analyzed the virulence gene profiles of the isolated k. pneumoniae strains. results: of 134 nf cases, 88 were monomicrobial, of which the most common pathogens were gas (n = 16) and k. pneumoniae (n = 15). monomicrobial kp-nf entailed a moderate risk of limb loss (20% vs 25%; p = 1.000) and high mortality (47% vs 19%; p = .135), and it was more likely to involve bacteremia (80% vs 31%; p = .011), concomitant distant abscesses (27% vs 0%; p = .043), and  underlying immunocompromising conditions (100% vs 63%; p = .018), compared with gas-nf. the isolated k. pneumoniae strains (n = 10) were of capsular polysaccharides genotype k1 (n = 4), k54/k20/k5 (n = 4), k2 (n = 1), and k16 (n = 1). all strains carried rmpa, iucabcdiuta, and iroa. genotype k1 strains had a significantly higher risk of concomitant distant abscesses, compared with non-k1  strains (75% vs 0%; p = .033). conclusions: k. pneumoniae has become a common pathogen of monomicrobial nf in taiwan. physicians treating patients with monomicrobial kp-nf should be aware of the risk of concomitant distant abscesses, particularly in cases caused by genotype k1.

TI  == leptin and mucosal immunity.
AB  == enhanced susceptibility to infection has long been recognized in children with congenital deficiency of leptin or its receptor. studies in mice have demonstrated that leptin deficiency affects both the innate and acquired immune systems. here, we review recent studies that demonstrate the impact on immunity of a common non-synonomous polymorphism of the leptin receptor. in a bangladesh cohort of children, the presence of two copies of the ancestral q223 allele was significantly associated with resistance to amebiasis. children and mice with at  least one copy of the leptin receptor 223r mutation were more susceptible to amebic colitis. leptin signaling in the intestinal epithelium and downstream stat3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) and shp2 (src homology phosphatase 2) signaling were required for protection in the murine model of amebic colitis. murine models have also implicated leptin in protection from other infections, including mycobacterium tuberculosis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and streptococcus pneumoniae. thus, the role of leptin signaling in infectious disease and specifically leptin-mediated protection of the intestinal epithelium  will be the focus of this review.

AB  == capsule polysaccharide is a major virulence factor for a wide range of bacterial  pathogens, including streptococcus pneumoniae. the biosynthesis of wzy-dependent  capsules in both gram-negative and -positive bacteria is regulated by a system involving a protein tyrosine phosphatase (ptp) and a protein tyrosine kinase. however, how the system functions is still controversial. in streptococcus pneumoniae, a major human pathogen, the system is present in all but 2 of the 93  serotypes found to date. in order to study this regulation further, we performed  a screen to find inhibitors of the phosphatase, cpsb. this led to the observation that a recently discovered marine sponge metabolite, fascioquinol e, inhibited cpsb phosphatase activity both in vitro and in vivo at concentrations that did not affect the growth of the bacteria. this inhibition resulted in decreased capsule synthesis in d39 and type 1 s. pneumoniae. furthermore, concentrations of fascioquinol e that inhibited capsule also lead to increased attachment of pneumococci to a macrophage cell line, suggesting that this compound would inhibit the virulence of the pathogen. interestingly, this compound also inhibited the phosphatase activity of the structurally unrelated gram-negative ptp, wzb, which belongs to separate family of protein tyrosine phosphatases. furthermore, incubation with klebsiella pneumoniae, which contains a homologous phosphatase, resulted in decreased capsule synthesis. taken together, these data  provide evidence that ptps are critical for wzy-dependent capsule production across a spectrum of bacteria, and as such represents a valuable new molecular target for the development of anti-virulence antibacterials.

TI  == gender and age-dependent etiology of community-acquired urinary tract infections.
AB  == urinary tract infections (utis) are among the most frequent community-acquired infections worldwide. escherichia coli is the most common uti pathogen although underlying host factors such as patients' age and gender may influence prevalence of causative agents. in this study, 61 273 consecutive urine samples received over a 22-month period from outpatients clinics of an urban area of north italy underwent microbiological culture with subsequent bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of positive samples. a total of 13 820 uropathogens were isolated and their prevalence analyzed according to patient's gender and age group. overall escherichia coli accounted for 67.6% of all isolates, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (8.8%), enterococcus faecalis (6.3%), proteus mirabilis (5.2%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%). data stratification  according to both age and gender showed e. coli isolation rates to be lower in both males aged >/=60 years (52.2%), e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa being more prevalent in this group (11.6% and 7.8%, resp.), as well as in those aged </=14 years (51.3%) in whom p. mirabilis prevalence was found to be as high as 21.2%. streptococcus agalactiae overall prevalence was found to be 2.3% although it was  shown to occur most frequently in women aged between 15 and 59 years (4.1%). susceptibility of e. coli to oral antimicrobial agents was demonstrated to be as  follows: fosfomycin (72.9%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (72.9%), ciprofloxacin (76.8%), ampicillin (48.0%), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (77.5%). in conclusion,  both patients' age and gender are significant factors in determining utis etiology; they can increase accuracy in defining the causative uropathogen as well as providing useful guidance to empiric treatment.

TI  == reproducible discrimination between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria using surface enhanced raman spectroscopy with infrared excitation.
AB  == the on time diagnostics of bacterial diseases is one of the essential steps in the foregoing treatment of such pathogens. here we sought to present an easy to use and robust method for the discrimination between gram-positive (enterococcus  faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes) and gram-negative (acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae) bacterial genera based on surface enhanced raman scattering (sers) spectroscopy. the robustness of our approach lies in the novel  method for the production of the ser substrate based on silver nanoparticles and  their subsequent re-crystallization in solutions containing high concentrations of chloride ions. the method presented here could be an interesting alternative both to commonly used histochemical approaches and commercial sers substrates.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of sitafloxacin against bacteria isolated from thai patients with urinary tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  == objective: to determine comparative in vitro activity of sitafloxacin against clinical isolates of bacteria from thai patients with urinary tract infection and those with lower respiratory tract infection. material and method: 1,255 clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus spp, streptococcus  pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis isolated from different thai patients with urinary tract infection and those with lower respiratory tract infection in 2010 were included. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of sitafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, imipenem, amikacin, ampicillin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, penicillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, azithromycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were determined by standard agar dilution method. results: the mic50 and mic90 values of sitafloxacin against all tested bacteria were lowest when compared with those of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin. sitafloxacin was active against 51% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) isolates. the activity of sitafloxacin against multidrug-resistant  (mdr) gram-negative bacteria, such as, extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing e. coli and k. pneumomiae, p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii was comparable to or more than that of some beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors, cephalosporins or carbapenems. conclusion: sitafloxacin is more active than levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against isolated bacteria from thai  patients with urinary tract and lower respiratory infections including antibiotic resistant bacteria, such as mrsa, esbl-producing gram-negatives, carbapenem-resistant a. baumannii.

TI  == sensitivities of major causative organisms isolated from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis against various antibacterial agents: results of subanalysis based on the presence of menopause.
AB  == we investigated whether the presence of menopause influenced the species and distribution of causative bacteria isolated from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis (the most common urinary tract infection), and we also investigated the sensitivity of the isolated species to antibacterial agents. using multivariate analysis, we also investigated risk factors for infection with quinolone-resistant escherichia coli, because its frequency has increased and it  is now a clinical problem in japan. six hundred and thirty-four strains were isolated from 489 premenopausal patients (mean age 32.3 +/- 10.1 years). major causative bacteria detected were escherichia coli (65.0 %), enterococcus faecalis (12.0 %), streptococcus agalactiae (5.5 %), and klebsiella pneumoniae (1.6 %). from 501 postmenopausal patients (mean age 68.7 +/- 10.29 years), 657 strains were isolated, and the major causative bacteria detected were e. coli (61.5 %), e. faecalis (13.7 %), k. pneumoniae (5.2 %), and s. agalactiae (4.0 %). the sensitivities to fluoroquinolones (fqs) and cephems of e. coli isolated from premenopausal patients were both >/=90 %, while the sensitivities to fqs of e. coli isolated from postmenopausal patients were about 5 % lower. in regard to infection with quinolone-resistant e. coli (minimal inhibitory concentration of levofloxacin [lvfx] >/=4 mug/ml), significant risk factors were observed in patients with more than two episodes of cystitis within a year (p = 0.0002), patients to whom antibacterial agents were used previously for this episode of cystitis (p = 0.0175), and patients who had a history of fq administration within 1 month. although the species and distribution of causative bacteria of acute uncomplicated cystitis were the same regardless of the presence of menopause, the sensitivities to fqs of e. coli detected in postmenopausal patients were significantly lower than those in the premenopausal women. the major risk factors for infection with quinolone-resistant e. coli were a history of fq administration and the morbidity of cystitis rather than the menopausal status. it was considered that taking an appropriate history including the morbidity of cystitis and history of fq administration, and the appropriate selection of an antibacterial agent, would be important when empirical therapy is required.

TI  == relationship between lactobacilli and opportunistic bacterial pathogens associated with vaginitis.
AB  == background: vaginitis, is an infectious inflammation of the vaginal mucosa, which sometimes involves the vulva. the balance of the vaginal flora is maintained by the lactobacilli and its protective and probiotic role in treating and preventing vaginal infection by producing antagonizing compounds which are regarded as safe  for humans. aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate the protective role of lactobacilli against common bacterial opportunistic pathogens in vaginitis and study the effects of some antibiotics on lactobacilli isolates. materials and methods: in this study (110) vaginal swabs were obtained from women suffering from vaginitis who admitted to babylon hospital of maternity and paediatrics in babylon province, iraq. the study involved the role of intrauterine device among  married women with vaginitis and also involved isolation of opportunistic bacterial isolates among pregnant and non pregnant women. this study also involved studying probiotic role of lactobacilli by production of some defense factors like hydrogen peroxide, bacteriocin, and lactic acid. results: results revealed that a total of 130 bacterial isolates were obtained. intrauterine device was a predisposing factor for vaginitis. the most common opportunistic bacterial isolates were staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, and klebsiella pneumoniae. all lactobacilli were hydrogen peroxide producers while some isolates were bacteriocin producers that inhibited some of opportunistic pathogens (s. aureus, e. coli). lactobacilli were sensitive to erythromycin while 93.3% of them were resistant to ciprofloxacin and (40%, 53.3%) of them were resistant to amoxicillin and gentamycin respectively. results revealed that there was an inverse relationship between lactobacilli presence and organisms causing vaginitis. this may be attributed to the production of defense  factors by lactobacilli. conclusion: the types of antibiotics used to treat vaginitis must be very selective in order not to kill the beneficial bacteria (lactobacilli) that help in preservation of vaginal health and ecosystem as being one of the probiotic bacteria.

TI  == lif reduces mics of antibiotics against clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == antibiotic resistance is an ever-growing problem yet the development of new antibiotics has slowed to a trickle, giving rise to the use of combination therapy to eradicate infections. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the combined inhibitory effect of lithium fluoride (lif) and commonly used antimicrobials on the growth of the following bacteria: enterococcus faecalis, staphyloccoccus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and streptococcus pneumoniae. the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, streptomycin, erythromycin, amoxicillin, and ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, alone or combined with lif were performed by microdilution method. mics were determined visually following 18-20 h of incubation at 37 degrees c. we observed reduced mics of antibiotics associated with lif ranging from two-fold to sixteen-fold. the strongest decreases of mics observed were for streptomycin and erythromycin associated with lif against acinetobacter baumannii and streptococcus pneumoniae. an eight-fold reduction was recorded for streptomycin against s. pneumoniae whereas an eight-fold and a sixteen-fold reduction were obtained for erythromycin against a. baumannii and s. pneumoniae. this suggests that lif exhibits a synergistic effect with a wide range of antibiotics and is indicative of its potential as an adjuvant in antibiotic therapy.

TI  == effects of an immunomodulatory feed additive on the development of mastitis in a  mouse infection model using four bovine-origin isolates.
AB  == the goal of this study was to examine the ability of a commercially available feed additive (omnigen-af) to reduce mammary infections caused by a single strain of mastitic pathogens (streptococcus uberis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae) and to examine the effects of the additive on markers of mammary immunity. four experiments were completed using a murine model of bovine mastitis. infection progression was examined using sybr-green- and taqman-based quantitative pcr assays of 16s ribosomal dna. infection of the mammary gland with all pathogens caused rapid (24 to 48 h) appearance of pathogen dna in mammary tissue. provision of the feed additive for 2 weeks before infection significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the extent of pathogen dna accumulation in models of s. uberis, e. coli and s. aureus infection. the additive was ineffective in reducing mammary infections caused by k. pneumoniae.  we examined mechanisms of action of the additive through assessment of mammary concentrations of mammary myeloperoxidase (mpo), major histocompatibility complex 2 class ii (mhc) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (mip) messenger rna (mrna) concentrations and by examining serum complement c3 concentration. infection of the mammary gland increased concentrations of mpo and mhc mrnas (p < 0.05). ability of the pathogen to elicit changes in mammary mpo and mhc gene expression was enhanced by the provision of the additive for 2 weeks before infection. these data imply that the additive increased the mammary inflammatory  response and increased antigen presentation during a mammary infection. value of  the additive in preventing mastitis in cattle awaits additional studies using a bovine model and further evaluation of additional strains of the pathogens used in this study.

TI  == the use of multiplex real-time pcr improves the detection of the bacterial etiology of community acquired pneumonia.
AB  == community-acquired pneumonia (cap) is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality especially to children and compromised hosts, such as the old and those with underlying chronic diseases. knowledge of pathogens causing cap constitutes  the basis for selection of antimicrobial treatment. previous data have shown that etiological agents can be identified in only up to 50% of patients, but this figure can be improved by using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). this study was designed to evaluate multiplex real-time pcr as a method for rapid differential detection of five bacterial causes of cap (streptococcus pneumoniae, burkholderia pseudomallei and atypical bacterial pathogens namely mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydophila pneumoniae and legionella pneumophila) in cap patients attending hospital tengku ampuan afzan (htaa)/ kuantan, pahang, malaysia. two previously developed multiplex real-time pcr assays, duplex for the differential detection of s. pneumoniae and b. pseudomallei and triplex for the atypical bacterial pathogens, were used to detect a bacterial cause of cap in blood and respiratory  samples. thus, 46 blood and 45 respiratory samples collected from 46 adult cap patients admitted to htaa were analysed by multiplex real-time pcr assays and conventional methods. the microbial etiology of cap could be established for 39.1% (18/46) of cap patients by conventional methods and this was increased to 65.2% (30/46) with the additional use of real-time pcr. the most frequently detected pathogens were s. pneumoniae (21.7% - all by pcr alone), klebsiella pneumoniae (17.3%), b. pseudomallei (13% - 83% of them positive by pcr alone and  17% by both culture and pcr), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.5%), m. pneumoniae (6.5%  - all by serology), c. pneumoniae (4.3% - all positive by both pcr and serology), l. pneumophila (2.1% - all by pcr alone), escherichia coli (4.3%). haemophilus infuenzae, acinetobacter lwoffii and acinetobacter baumannii were detected by conventional methods (2.1% for each).

TI  == minim typing--a rapid and low cost mlst based typing tool for klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == here we report a single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) based genotyping method for klebsiella pneumoniae utilising high-resolution melting (hrm) analysis of fragments within the multilocus sequence typing (mlst) loci. the approach is termed mini-mlst or minim typing and it has previously been applied to streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium. six snps  were derived from concatenated mlst sequences on the basis of maximisation of the simpsons index of diversity (d). dna fragments incorporating these snps and predicted to be suitable for hrm analysis were designed. using the assumption that hrm alleles are defined by g+c content, minim typing using six fragments was predicted to provide a d = 0.979 against known sts. the method was tested against 202 k. pneumoniae using a blinded approach in which the mlst analyses were performed after the hrm analyses. the hrm-based alleles were indeed in accordance with g+c content, and the minim typing identified known sts and flagged new sts.  the tonb mlst locus was determined to be very diverse, and the two minim fragments located herein contribute greatly to the resolving power. however these fragments are refractory to amplification in a minority of isolates. therefore, we assessed the performance of two additional formats: one using only the four fragments located outside the tonb gene (d = 0.929), and the other using hrm data from these four fragments in conjunction with sequencing of the tonb mlst fragment (d = 0.995). the hrm assays were developed on the rotorgene 6000, and the method was shown to also be robust on the lightcycler 480, allowing a 384-well high through-put format. the assay provides rapid, robust and low-cost typing with fully portable results that can directly be related to current mlst data. minim typing in combination with molecular screening for antibiotic resistance markers can be a powerful surveillance tool kit.

AB  == twenty-one lactobacillus isolates from "sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. these isolates were preliminarily identified as lactobacillus plantarum (62%), lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-pcr genomic fingerprinting. twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, proteinase k) and inhibition of other lactobacillus spp. these  bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin g, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. the bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria,  several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the world health organization, as well as multidrug-resistant strains. these include staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare typhi, bacillus cereus, streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella pneumoniae and shigella flexneri. these lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.

TI  == necrotizing pneumonia: a rare complication of pneumonia requiring special consideration.
AB  == purpose of review: necrotizing pneumonia is a rare complication of bacterial lung infection. its cause is owing to either a virulence factor of the microorganism or a predisposing factor of the host. this disease may cause devastating complications such as diffuse pulmonary inflammation, septic shock, and respiratory failure, making treatment more difficult. in the recent decade, the cause of necrotizing pneumonia and the role of surgical treatment have raised considerable attention, leading to therapeutically specific suggestions. recent findings: staphylococcus aureus strains that produce panton-valentine leukocidin  have been reported to cause rapidly progressive necrosis of the lung tissue in young immunocompetent patients. furthermore, recent studies have showed the risk  of disease progression is associated with underlying medical conditions. although antibiotics are the first choice of treatment for necrotizing pneumonia, it has been emphasized that surgical treatment is a feasible alternative option in patients who fail to respond to antibiotics and develop continued deterioration and complications. summary: the current knowledge of cause, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of necrotizing pneumonia are summarized. antibiotics remain the mainstay of treatment. lung resection can be considered an alternative treatment option in patients who are unresponsive to antibiotic therapy and develop parenchymal complications. outcome is affected by the degree  of disease progression and comorbidities.

TI  == complications of port-a-cath(r) in patients with sickle cell disease.
AB  == background: red cell exchange/transfusion is frequently used in the management of patients with medical complications related to acute severe sickle cell disease (scd). however, peripheral venous access is often difficult without central venous catheters (cvcs) in adult patients with moderate or severe scd. aims: to review our experience with the use of the port-a-cath((r)) device in sixteen patients with scd undergoing exchange or simple transfusions. methods: among a cohort of 550 patients who frequently visited the inpatient service, sixteen scd  patients required the insertion of a port-a-cath((r)) device. these patients included 3 males and 13 females, aged 25-44 years [31.1 +/- 2.3; mean +/- sd]. a  total of 24 port-a-cath((r)) devices were implanted in these 16 patients during the study period. eleven patients had 1 device implanted, three patients had 2 devices, one patient had 3 devices, and one patient had 4 devices implanted. results: out of the 24 devices implanted, 17 required removal, due to either infection associated with sepsis and/or thrombosis. the organisms involved were candida spp. (3), c. parapsilosis (2), c. albicans (1), c. famata (1), c. lusitanice (1), staphylococcus spp. (6), and s. aureus (3), as well as the coagulase-negative staphylococcus (2), alpha hemolytic streptococcus (1), diphtheroid bacilli (2), pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), ps. spp. (3), escherichia coli (3), klebsiella oxytoca (1), klebsiella pneumoniae (1), klebsiella spp. (1), serratia liquefaciens (1), serratia fanticola (1), achromobacter spp. (2) chromobacterium violaceum (1), delftia acidovirans (1), stenotrophomonas maltophile (1), alcaligenes faecalis (1), and enterobacter cloacae (1). two episodes of documented thrombosis were observed. one case presented with right atrial thrombosis/svc syndrome and the other case presented with left upper arm thrombosis. two patients died with ports in situ, while five patients had ports in place at the time of this study. the median working life of the ports was 688.5 days (range: 39-3925). the rate of infective complications was 2.63 infections per 1000 catheter days, and the number of infections was significantly correlated with the number of ports [pearson's r=0.66; p<0.01]. discussion: our results suggest that patients with scd suffer infective complications associated  with the port-a-cath((r)), which often necessitate its removal. although these devices are extremely useful, their optimal beneficial potential is only realized if the patients receive proper care at special centers well-versed in the maintenance of such devices by experienced staff.

TI  == efficacy of human simulated exposures of ceftaroline against phenotypically diverse enterobacteriaceae isolates.
AB  == ceftaroline fosamil, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin, exhibits potent bactericidal activity against common gram-negative pathogens, including enterobacteriaceae, and gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a human simulated dose of ceftaroline fosamil against clinical enterobacteriaceae in both neutropenic and immunocompetent mouse thigh infection models. thirty-five enterobacteriaceae isolates with ceftaroline mics ranging from 0.25 to 32 mug/ml were selected for the neutropenic model, and five escherichia coli isolates were also tested in the immunocompetent model. two hours after inoculation, the ceftaroline fosamil human simulated regimen of 600 mg intravenously (i.v.) every 12 h was administered. the change in log(10) cfu after 24 h was compared to that in 0 h controls. the human  simulated regimen produced predictable efficacy against 18 of 20 isolates with a  mic of </= 1 mug/ml. similar efficacy was seen in the immunocompetent model against isolates with a mic of </= 2 mug/ml, and enhanced efficacy was observed against the isolate with a mic of 4 mug/ml. human simulated exposures to ceftaroline fosamil at 600 mg every 12 h provided predictable efficacy against enterobacteriaceae with mics of </= 1 mug/ml and enhanced efficacy within the immunocompetent model, supporting the clinical utility of ceftaroline fosamil against these organisms.

TI  == vaginal bacterial flora and cytology in proestrous bitches: role on fertility.
AB  == the study of canine vaginal cytology underwent limited evolution over the years.  presence and significance of inflammatory cells in vaginal smears are little considered aspects in the bitch. moreover, occurrence of vaginal bacteria in breeding bitches during follicular phase of the reproductive cycle, in absence of clinical signs of infection, involves the difficult question of antibiotics administration. the aim of this study was to relate findings in vaginal cytology  (presence of neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, erytrocytes and bacteria) and microbial environment during proestrus with fertility outcomes (development of pregnancy, uterine infection, resorption, abortion and neonatal mortality). bacteria sensitivity to antibiotics normally used in small animal practice was also evaluated. bacteria isolated from vagina, in order of frequency, were enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus beta-haemolyticus, pasteurella multocida, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, e. coli haemolyticus, arcanobacterium pyogenes, streptococcus spp., staphylococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. no mycoplasmas were observed. the present study showed that proestrous cytological aspects do not affect fertility. eosinophils were never detected, while erythrocytes were always detected. during diestrus, e. coli was found in all pregnant bitches that developed clinical symptoms of uterine disorders (n = 3), resulting in uterine infection, resorption or abortion, but without statistical significance. vaginal presence of streptococcus spp. in proestrus was instead negatively associated with development of uterine infections (p = 0.005). therefore, streptococcus spp. could have a protective competitive role against more dangerous pathogens affecting fertility of the bitch. among the 12 antibiotics tested, gram-negative bacteria showed a significant sensitivity towards the amoxicillin and clavulanic acid association (p = 0.038). however, antibiotic treatment before mating, on the basis of positive culture, yet in the absence of clinical signs, seems to be unnecessary besides harmful leading to imbalance in vaginal commensal flora with adverse effects on fertility. in conclusion, vaginal bacteria, neutrophils, lymphocytes and erytrocytes should be considered as physiological aspect in the bitch during  proestrus that does not require antibiotic therapy when asymptomatic.

TI  == [epidemiology and clinical features in diabetic patients with invasive infections treated at the clinical hospital of infectious diseases of iasi, romania, between 2008-2010].
AB  == infections in the diabetic population can be severe and life threatning at least  for two reasons: clinical signs are often torpid, masqued by chronical complications of diabetes leading to late recognition and medical adresability and also because of the inability to control established infection due to complex cell-mediated and humoral immunity deffects. the aim of the study was to evaluate the etiology, clinical features and outcome in diabetic patients with invazive disease. material and methods: a retrospective study was conducted between january 2008 and december 2010 at the clinical hospital of infectious diseases iasi among 75 diabetic patients with sepsis of microbiologically confirmed etiology (positive cultures from normally sterile sites) and sepsis with clinically suspected etiology (positive cultures from pus). cases with positive urocultures and coprocultures only, were excluded. results: from 75 diabetics, 56% were males, 90,7% being over 50 years. severe cases of sepsis (33/75, 44%) were associated more often with insulin-treated diabetes than non-insulin treated group (40% vs. 4%, p<0,005) probably because of multiple comorbidities associated as suggested by a high charlson score (6,09 vs. 4,09, p<0,05). there were 64 cases with confirmed etiology and 11 cases with clinically suspected etiology. staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli were the most common agents isolated,  being involved in 16 (21,3%) cases each, followed by coagulase negative staphylococci (14/18,66%), enterococcus spp.(6/8%), group b streptococcus (3/4%), streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., salmonella spp. (2/2,66% each), aerococcus viridans, streptococcus equi, klebsiella pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, sphyngomonas paucimobilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis (1/1,33%). multiple septic disseminations occured in 17(22,6%) cases and meningeal involvment was doccumented in 10(15,6%) cases. meticillin resistance was noted in 53,3% for invasive isolates of s. aureus. among 16 invazive strains of e. coli, 25% were resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporins, 17% to ciprofloxacin and 6,6% to aminoglycosides and colimycin. there were no e.  coli strains resistant to imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam and aztreonam. the mean mortality rate was 14,66%. conclusions: the high level of resistance of s. aureus and e. coli to commonly used antibiotics and meningeal involvement imposes a multidisciplinary approach of the diabetic patient. proper knowledge of the pathogers involved in the potential invazive diseases is an important tool for successful treatment with appropriate empirical broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents.

TI  == different potency of bacterial antigens tlr2 and tlr4 ligands in stimulating mature mast cells to cysteinyl leukotriene synthesis.
AB  == the aim of study was to compare the potency of different bacterial antigens to induce rat mature mast cell to cysteinyl leukotriene (cyslt) generation. we examined toll-like receptor (tlr)2 agonists, i.e. lipoteichoic acid (lta) staphylococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus, lipoarabinomannan (lam) mycobacterium smegmatis, peptydoglican (pgn) staphylococcus aureus, as well as tlr4 agonists, i.e. lipopolysaccharide (lps) klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, pophyromonas gingivalis and escherichia coli. we also estimated the effect of tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-, interleukin (il)-6-, ccl5-, and il-10-priming on mast cell cyslt synthesis following bacterial antigen activation. we found that all bacterial antigens activated mast cells to cyslt generation; however, the extent of cyslt release in response to stimulation varied. out of the examined antigens lps p. gingivalis exhibited the highest potency, as it induced cyslt generation acting at a very low concentration (10(-4) ng/ml). other lpss affected mast cells at higher (up to 10(5) -fold) concentrations. ltas were the most effective at concentrations of 5 x 10(2) ng/ml, while lam and pgn stimulated mast cells to maximal cyslt generation at concentrations as high as 10(5) ng/ml. anti-tlr2 and anti-tlr4 antibodies, as well as nuclear factor kappab (nf-kappab) inhibitor significantly diminished cyslt generation in response to bacterial antigen stimulation. priming with tnf,  il-6 and ccl5 did not affect bacterial antigen-induced cyslt generation, while il-10-pretreatment caused significant decrease in cyslt synthesis by mast cells.  these observations might have a great pathophysiological importance; inasmuch cyslts strongly influence the development and intensity of inflammation during bacterial infection.

TI  == bronchoscopic findings in children with chronic wet cough.
AB  == objectives: protracted bacterial bronchitis is defined as the presence of more than 4 weeks of chronic wet cough that resolves with appropriate antibiotic therapy, in the absence of alternative diagnoses. the diagnosis of protracted bacterial bronchitis is not readily accepted within the pediatric community, however, and data on the incidence of bacterial bronchitis in children are deficient. the objective of this study was to determine the frequency of bacterial bronchitis in children with chronic wet cough and to analyze their bronchoscopic findings. methods: we performed a retrospective review of charts of children who presented with chronic wet cough, unresponsive to therapy, before referral to the pediatric pulmonary clinic. results: a total of 197 charts and bronchoscopy reports were analyzed. of 109 children who were 0 to 3 years of age, 33 (30.3%) had laryngomalacia and/or tracheomalacia. the bronchoscopy showed purulent bronchitis in 56% (110) cases and nonpurulent bronchitis in 44% (87). the bronchoalveolar lavage bacterial cultures were positive in 46% (91) of the children and showed nontypable haemophilus influenzae (49%), streptococcus pneumoniae (20%), moraxella catarrhalis (17%), staphylococcus aureus (12%), and klebsiella pneumoniae in 1 patient. the chi(2) analysis demonstrated that positive bacterial cultures occurred more frequently in children with purulent bronchitis (74, 69.8%) than in children with nonpurulent bronchitis (19, 19.8%) (p < .001). conclusions: children who present with chronic wet cough are often found to have evidence of purulent bronchitis on bronchoscopy. this finding is often indicative of a bacterial lower airway infection in these children.

TI  == in vitro potential of equine defa1 and ecath1 as alternative antimicrobial drugs  in rhodococcosis treatment.
AB  == rhodococcus equi, the causal agent of rhodococcosis, is a severe pathogen of foals but also of immunodeficient humans, causing bronchopneumonia. the pathogen  is often found together with klebsiella pneumoniae or streptococcus zooepidemicus in foals. of great concern is the fact that some r. equi strains are already resistant to commonly used antibiotics. in the present study, we evaluated the in vitro potential of two equine antimicrobial peptides (amps), ecath1 and defa1, as new drugs against r. equi and its associated pathogens. the peptides led to growth inhibition and death of r. equi and s. zooepidemicus at low micromolar concentrations. moreover, ecath1 was able to inhibit growth of k. pneumoniae. both peptides caused rapid disruption of the r. equi membrane, leading to cell lysis. interestingly, ecath1 had a synergic effect together with rifampin. furthermore, ecath1 was not cytotoxic against mammalian cells at bacteriolytic concentrations and maintained its high killing activity even at physiological salt concentrations. our data suggest that equine amps, especially ecath1, may be promising candidates for alternative drugs to control r. equi in mono- and coinfections.

TI  == a randomised, double-blind trial comparing ceftobiprole medocaril with ceftriaxone with or without linezolid for the treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalisation.
AB  == community-acquired pneumonia (cap) is a serious infection requiring hospitalisation in 20% of cases. the novel cephalosporin ceftobiprole has microbiological activity against the major bacterial pathogens causing cap, including streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and klebsiella pneumoniae, as well as against staphylococcus aureus, including meticillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). this was a multicentre, double-blind study in which 706 patients with cap severe enough to require hospitalisation were randomised to ceftobiprole or to an expert-recommended course of ceftriaxone +/-  linezolid (comparator group). clinical and microbiological outcomes were determined 7-14 days after completion of therapy (test-of-cure visit). for the 469 clinically evaluable patients, cure rates were 86.6% vs. 87.4% for ceftobiprole and comparator, respectively [95% confidence interval (ci) of the difference, -6.9% to 5.3%]; in the intention-to-treat (itt) analysis of 638 cap patients, these cure rates were 76.4% vs. 79.3%, respectively (95% ci of the difference, -9.3% to 3.6%). a typical bacterial pathogen was identified in 29% of the itt population. microbiological eradication rates in the 144 microbiologically evaluable patients were 88.2% and 90.8% for the respective treatment groups (95% ci of the difference, -12.6% to 7.5%). both study drugs were well tolerated, with but a minority of patients requiring premature discontinuation due to an adverse event (6% in the ceftobiprole group and 4% in the comparator group). the overall incidence of treatment-related adverse events  was higher in the ceftobiprole group, primarily owing to differences in rates of  self-limited nausea (7% vs. 2%) and vomiting (5% vs. 2%). in summary, ceftobiprole was non-inferior to the comparator (ceftriaxone +/- linezolid) in all clinical and microbiological analyses conducted, suggesting that ceftobiprole has a potential role in treating hospitalised patients with cap.

AB  == the results comparison is made between pcr polymerase chain reaction techniques in real-time mode and cultural techniques of analysis of blood samples in patients with suspicion of bacteriemia during early postoperational period. from  september to december 2009 43 blood samples from 37 adult patients aged 59+9.2 years were analyzed on suspicion of bacteriemia. the blood samples for pcr analysis (septifast technique roche diagnostics, switzerland) were taken parallel to the inoculation. among 43 samples 20 (46.5%) were positive. the species structure of identified germs was as follows: enteroccocus faecalis - 2, klebsiella pneumonia - 2, enteroccocusfaecium - 1, pseudomonas aeruginosa - 2, coagulase negative staphilococcus - 11. all cases of seeding of coagulase negative staphilococcus were interpreted using pcr techniques as negative or contamination. in four cases a full matching of results of compared techniques was obtained. in cases when hemoculture was negative (n = 23) the pcr techniques  permitted to detect two positive results (staphilococcus spp. and stenotrophomonas maltophilia). in three cases of positive hemoculture the pcr techniques brought negative result and at that in two cases the causative agents  (pseudomonas fluorescens and ralstonia mannitolilytica) were out of specter of pathogens detected by this method. the pcr techniques in real-time mode permit to reduce significantly time of pathogen investigation and to detect the false positive results conditioned by contamination. this techniques has to be applied  in parallel with cultural technique because only this approach provide a possibility to get the clinically needed data related to the sensitivity of causative agent to antibacterial preparations.

TI  == multi-drug resistant gram negative bacilli causing early neonatal sepsis in india.
AB  == objective: to study the organisms causing early and late onset neonatal sepsis, with special reference to multi-drug resistant gram negative bacilli, at two neonatal units (one urban, one rural) in india. methods: prospective surveillance study. results: there were 159 episodes of sepsis (81 urban and 77 rural) affecting 158 babies. gram negative bacilli caused 117 infections (68%) and predominated at both centres in both early and late sepsis. klebsiella pneumoniae was the commonest organism, causing 61 infections (38.3%). in early sepsis (0-2 days), non-fermenting gram negative bacilli caused 42.1% of infections at the urban centre; there were no cases of early group b streptococcus sepsis. late onset sepsis was mainly caused by gram negative bacilli at both centres. multi-drug resistance of over 80% of early-onset gram negative organisms to ampicillin, third generation cephalosporins and gentamicin indicates that these multi-resistant organisms are almost certainly circulating widely in the community. the overall mortality from early sepsis was 27.3% (9 of 33) and from late sepsis was 26.2% (33 of 126). gram negative bacilli caused all deaths from early sepsis and 87.5% of deaths from late sepsis. conclusion: this study shows that multi-drug resistant gram negative bacilli are a major cause of early and late neonatal sepsis in india and are almost certainly widespread in the community.

TI  == bacterial colonization or infection in chronic sinusitis.
AB  == the aim of this study was the determination of bacteria present in maxillary and  ethmoid cavities in patients with chronic sinusitis and to correlate these findings with bacteria simultaneously present in their nasopharynx. the purpose of this correlation was to establish the role of bacteria found in chronically inflamed sinuses and to evaluate if the bacteria present colonized or infected sinus mucosa. nasopharyngeal and sinus swabs of 65 patients that underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery were cultivated and at the same time the presence of leukocytes were determined in each swab. the most frequently found bacteria in nasopharynx were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus spp., streptococcus viridans and streptococcus pneumoniae. maxillary or ethmoidal sinus swabs yielded bacterial growth in 47 (72.31%) patients. the most frequently found bacteria in sinuses were staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella spp. and streptococci (pneumoniae, viridans and spp.). the insignificant number of leukocytes was present in each sinus and nasopharyngeal swab. every published microbiology study of chronic sinusitis proved that sinus mucosa were colonized with bacteria and not infected, yet antibiotic therapy was discussed making no difference between infection and colonization. chronic sinusitis should be considered a chronic inflammatory condition rather than bacterial infection, so routine antibiotic therapy should be avoided. empiric antibiotic therapy should be prescribed only in cases when the acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis occurs and the antibiotics prescribed should aim the usual bacteria causing acute sinusitis. in case of therapy failure, antibiotics should be changed having in mind that under certain circumstances any bacteria colonizing sinus mucosa can cause acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis.

TI  == investigation of the antibacterial activity of pioglitazone.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate the antibacterial potential of pioglitazone, a member of the thiazolidinediones class of drugs, against gram-positive (streptococcus pneumoniae) and gram-negative (escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria. methods: susceptibility testing was done using the antibiotic disk diffusion method and the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of pioglitazone was measured according to the broth micro incubation standard method. results: pioglitazone induced a dose-dependent antibacterial activity in which the optimal concentration was 80 mum. furthermore, results indicated that while e. coli was sensitive (mic = 31.25 +/- 3.87 mg/l) to pioglitazone-induced cytotoxicity, s. pneumoniae and k. pneumoniae were resistant (mic = 62.5 +/- 3.77 mg/l and mic = 62.5 +/- 4.14 mg/l, respectively). moreover, pretreatment of bacteria with a suboptimal concentration of pioglitazone (40 mum) before adding amoxicillin, cephalexin, co-trimoxazole, or ciprofloxacin enhanced the antibacterial activity  of all agents except co-trimoxazole. this enhancing effect was particularly seen  against k. pneumoniae. conclusion: these results indicate the possibility of a new and potentially important pioglitazone effect and the authors' ongoing studies aim to illustrate the mechanism(s) by which this antibacterial effect is  induced.

TI  == prevalence of uropathogens in diabetic patients and their corresponding resistance pattern: results of a survey conducted at diagnostic centers in dhaka, bangladesh.
AB  == objectives: urinary tract infection is the second most common clinical indication for empirical antibiotic treatment in primary and secondary health care settings. the incidence of diabetes mellitus throughout the world is increasing strikingly  and in the long run, it has some major effects on the genitourinary system which  makes diabetic patients more liable to urinary tract infection. this study is designed to reveal the distribution of uropathogens in diabetic patients according to age and sex, and corresponding resistance patterns. methods: a six-month retrospective review of urine culture assay data from august 2009 to january 2010 from randomly selected 85 patients who suffered from both urinary tract infection and diabetes was conducted. relevant information was retrieved and analyzed statistically using microsoft(r) excel 2002 software. results: the study showed that females are more vulnerable to pathogenic attack than males throughout a wide age distribution. in terms of pathogenic distribution, escherichia coli was the highest followed by streptococcus sp., acinetobacter, klebsiella pneumoniae and few others. though meropenem showed no resistance with  e. coli, acinetobacter and klebsiella pneumoniae, in the case of streptococcus sp. it exhibited resistance of 25%. amikacin exhibited only 3% resistance with e. coli, whereas no resistance with acinetobacter and klebsiella pneumoniae, and most interestingly showed 75% resistance with streptococcus sp. gentamicin exhibited no resistance with acinetobacter while 26.9%, 50% and 87.5% resistance  with e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus sp. respectively. hence, nitrofurantoin exhibited less resistance 11.9% compared to 12.5% resistance with  e. coli and streptococcus sp. nitrofurantoin was highly prone to resistance with  acinetobacter and klebsiella pneumoniae (100%, 50% respectively). cephalosporins  (cephradine, cefixime, ceftriaxone, cefepime etc.) showed moderate resistance (avg. 50%), whereas amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin showed the highest resistance in all these cases. conclusion: pathogens are mostly resistant to antibiotics including amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, cephalosporins and nitrofurantoin, with few exceptions including gentamicin, amikacin and meropenem.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of mastitis pathogens of dairy cattle and comparative relevance to humans.
AB  == mastitis, inflammation of the mammary gland, can be caused by a wide range of organisms, including gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, mycoplasmas and algae. many microbial species that are common causes of bovine mastitis, such as  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus also occur as commensals or pathogens of humans whereas other causative species, such as streptococcus uberis, streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae or staphylococcus chromogenes, are almost exclusively found in animals. a wide range of molecular typing methods have been used in the past two decades to investigate the epidemiology of bovine mastitis at the subspecies  level. these include comparative typing methods that are based on electrophoretic banding patterns, library typing methods that are based on the sequence of selected genes, virulence gene arrays and whole genome sequencing projects. the strain distribution of mastitis pathogens has been investigated within individual animals and across animals, herds, countries and host species, with consideration of the mammary gland, other animal or human body sites, and environmental sources. molecular epidemiological studies have contributed considerably to our understanding of sources, transmission routes, and prognosis for many bovine mastitis pathogens and to our understanding of mechanisms of host-adaptation and  disease causation. in this review, we summarize knowledge gleaned from two decades of molecular epidemiological studies of mastitis pathogens in dairy cattle and discuss aspects of comparative relevance to human medicine.

TI  == rapid identification of bovine mastitis pathogens by high-resolution melt analysis of 16s rdna sequences.
AB  == accurate identification of mastitis pathogens is often compromised when using conventional culture-based methods. here, we report a novel, rapid assay tested for speciation of bacterial mastitis pathogens using high-resolution melt analysis (hrma) of 16s rdna sequences. real-time pcr amplification of 16s rrna gene fragment, spanning the variable region v5 and v6 was performed with a resulting amplicon of 290bp. first, a library was generated of melt curves of 9 common pathogens that are implicated in bovine mastitis. six of the isolates, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus  uberis, staphylococcus aureus and mycoplasma bovis, were type strains while the other 3, arcanobacterium pyogenes, corynebacterium bovis and streptococcus dysgalactiae, were bovine mastitis field isolates. four of the type strains, e. coli, s. agalactiae, k. pneumoniae and s. aureus, were found to be of human origin, while the other 3 type strains were isolated from bovine infections. secondly, the melt curves and corresponding amplicon sequences of a. pyogenes, e. coli, s. agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae, k. pneumoniae, s. uberis and s. aureus were compared with 10 bovine mastitis field isolates of each pathogen. based on the distinct differences in melt curves and sequences between human and bovine isolates of e. coli and k. pneumoniae, it was deemed necessary to select a set of bovine strains for these pathogens to be used as reference strains in the hrma. next, the hrma was validated by three interpreters analyzing the differential clustering pattern of melt curves of 60 bacterial cultures obtained from mastitis milk samples. the three test interpreters were blinded to the culture and sequencing results of the isolates. overall accuracy of the validation assay was  95% as there was difficulty in identifying the streptococci due to heterogeneity  observed in the pcr amplicons of s. uberis. the present study revealed that broad-range real-time pcr with hrma can be used as a powerful, fast and low-cost  tool for the differentiation of clinically important bacterial mastitis pathogens.

TI  == differential effect of prior influenza infection on alveolar macrophage phagocytosis of staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli: involvement of interferon-gamma production.
AB  == the influenza a virus is one of the main causes of respiratory infection. although influenza virus infection alone can result in pneumonia, secondary bacterial infection combined with the virus is the major cause of morbidity and mortality. interestingly, while influenza infection increases susceptibility to some bacteria, including streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), and haemophilus influenzae, other bacteria such as escherichia coli (e.  coli) and klebsiella pneumoniae are not associated with influenza infection. the  reason for this discrepancy is not known. in this study, it was found that prior  influenza virus infection inhibits murine alveolar macrophage phagocytosis of s.  aureus but not of e. coli. here, the mechanism for this inhibition is elucidated: prior influenza virus infection strongly increases interferon gamma (ifn-gamma) production. furthermore, it was shown that ifn-gamma differentially affects alveolar macrophage phagocytosis of s. aureus and e. coli. the findings of the present study explain how influenza virus infection increases susceptibility to some bacteria, such as s. aureus, but not others, and provides evidence that ifn-gamma might be a promising target for protecting the human population from secondary bacterial infection by influenza.

TI  == susceptibility of bacterial isolates from community-acquired infections in sub-saharan africa and asia to macrolide antibiotics.
AB  == objective: to review the literature on the susceptibility of common community pathogens in sub-saharan africa and asia to the macrolide antibiotics. methods: inclusion criteria required that isolates were collected since 2004 to ensure results were of contemporary relevance. the data were aggregated by region, age group and sterility of site of culture sample. results: a total of 51 studies were identified, which reported the macrolide antimicrobial susceptibilities of common bacterial pathogens isolated since 2004. in general, there was less macrolide resistance in african than in asian isolates. most african studies reported high levels of macrolide susceptibility in streptococcus pneumoniae, whereas most chinese studies reported high levels of resistance. there was very little information available for gram-negative organisms. conclusions: susceptibility of the pneumococcus to macrolides in ssa remains high in many areas, and good activity of azithromycin has been shown against salmonellae spp.  in asia. in urban areas where high antibiotic consumption is prevalent, there was evidence of increased resistance to macrolides. however, there is no information  on susceptibility from large areas in both continents.

TI  == potential role of tigecycline in the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.
AB  == tigecycline is a member of the glycylcycline class of antimicrobials, which is structurally similar to the tetracycline class. it demonstrates potent in vitro activity against causative pathogens that are most frequently isolated in patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (cabp), including (but not limited to) streptococcus pneumoniae (both penicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains), haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase-producing strains), klebsiella pneumoniae, and 'atypical organisms' (namely chlamydophila pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and legionella pneumophila). comparative randomized clinical trials to date performed in hospitalized patients receiving tigecycline 100 mg intravenous (iv) x 1 and then 50 mg iv twice daily thereafter have demonstrated efficacy and safety comparable to the comparator agent. major adverse effects were primarily gastrointestinal in nature. tigecycline represents a parenteral monotherapy option in hospitalized patients with cabp (especially in patients unable to receive respiratory fluoroquinolones). however, alternate and/or additional therapies should be considered in patients with more severe forms of cabp in light of recent data of increased mortality in patients receiving tigecycline for other types of severe infection.

TI  == clinical and economic burden of community-acquired pneumonia amongst adults in the asia-pacific region.
AB  == community-acquired pneumonia (cap) is an important cause of mortality and morbidity amongst adults in the asia-pacific region. literature published between 1990 and may 2010 on the clinical and economic burden of cap amongst adults in this region was reviewed. cap is a significant health burden with significant economic impact in this region. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and advanced age were risk factors for  cap. aetiological agents included streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, gram-negative bacteria, mycobacterium tuberculosis, burkholderia pseudomallei, staphylococcus aureus and atypical pathogens (mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydophila pneumoniae and legionella spp.), with important differences in the prevalence of these pathogens within the region. antibiotic resistance was significant but was not linked to excess mortality. aetiological pathogens remained susceptible to newer antimicrobial agents. rational antibiotic use is essential for preventing resistance, and increased surveillance is required to identify future trends in incidence and aetiology and to drive treatment and prevention strategies.

TI  == synergistic antibacterial effects of polyphenolic compounds from olive mill wastewater.
AB  == polyphenols or phenolic compounds are groups of secondary metabolites widely distributed in plants and found in olive mill wastewater (omw). phenolic compounds as well as omw extracts were evaluated in vitro for their antimicrobial activity against gram-positive (streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae). most of  the tested phenols were not effective against the four bacterial strains when tested as single compounds at concentrations of up to 1000 mug ml(-1). hydroxytyrosol at 400 mug ml(-1) caused complete growth inhibition of the four strains. gallic acid was effective at 200, and 400 mug ml(-1) against s. aureus,  and s. pyogenes, respectively, but not against the gram negative bacteria. an omw fraction called antisolvent was obtained after the addition of ethanol to the crude omw. hplc analysis of antisolvent fraction revealed that this fraction contains mainly hydroxytyrosol (10.3%), verbascoside (7.4%), and tyrosol (2.6%).  the combinations of antisolvent/gallic acid were tested using the low minimal inhibitory concentrations which revealed that 50/100-100/100 mug ml(-1) caused complete growth inhibition of the four strains. these results suggest that omw specific fractions augmented with natural phenolic ingredients may be utilized as a source of bioactive compounds to control pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == bacteriology of deep neck abscesses: a retrospective review of 96 consecutive cases.
AB  == introduction: this study aimed to review the microbiology of deep neck abscesses  and identify the factors that influence their occurrence. methods: a retrospective chart review was done of patients diagnosed with deep neck abscesses at the department of otorhinolaryngology, tan tock seng hospital, singapore between 2004 and 2009. the data of 131 deep neck abscess patients were  reviewed, and those with positive pus culture were included in the study. logistic regression was applied to analyse and compare the incidence of common organisms in various conditions (age, gender, aetiology and effects of diabetes mellitus). results: of the 96 patients recruited, 18 had polymicrobial cultures.  the leading pathogens cultured were klebsiella (k.) pneumoniae (27.1 percent), streptococcus milleri group (smg) bacteria (21.9 percent) and anaerobic bacteria-not otherwise specified (nos) (20.8 percent). k. pneumoniae (50.0 percent) was over-represented in the diabetic group. smg bacteria (68.8 percent)  and anaerobic bacteria-nos (43.8 percent) were most commonly isolated in patients with odontogenic infections. k. pneumoniae was found more commonly among female patients (39.3 percent). the distribution of the three leading pathogens between  patients aged below 50 years and those 50 years and above was comparable. k. pneumoniae was the commonest organism cultured in parapharyngeal space abscesses, while the submandibular space and parotid space most commonly isolated smg bacteria and staphylococcus aureus, respectively. conclusion: broad-spectrum antibiotics are recommended for treating deep neck abscesses. empirical antibiotic coverage against k. pneumoniae infection in diabetic patients, and smg and anaerobic bacteria in patients with an odontogenic infection, is advocated. routine antibiotic coverage against gram-negative bacteria is not paramount.

TI  == comparative activity of tigecycline and tetracycline on gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria revealed by a multicentre study in four north european countries.
AB  == background: this study involves a multicentre surveillance of tigecycline and tetracycline activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria from primary care centres (pccs), general hospital wards (ghws) and intensive care units (icus) in denmark (n = 9), finland (n = 10), norway (n = 7) and sweden (n = 19). methods: the hospitals were each asked to test 30 consecutive gram-positive  and 30 gram-negative clinical isolates. supportive information accompanying each  isolate included the study centre, ward level (pcc, ghw, or icu), patient identification and source of the isolate. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) for tetracycline and tigecycline were determined with the etest. results:  the isolates collected comprised 1610 gram-negative and 1767 gram-positive clinical isolates. the study showed low rates of non-susceptibility (intermediate (i) and resistant (r)) to tigecycline: <1% in escherichia coli, though other enterobacteriaceae showed higher rates (enterobacter cloacae (7%), klebsiella pneumoniae (9%) and serratia spp. (23%)). the overall non-susceptibility rate for tigecycline in enterobacteriaceae with species-related breakpoints for tigecycline was 6% (4% excluding serratia spp.). the activity of tigecycline against haemophilus influenzae and acinetobacter spp. was high with a mic(50) of  0.25 mg/l and mic(90) of 1 mg/l. the prevalence of non-susceptibility to tigecycline among gram-positive bacteria was <1%. the corresponding figure for tetracycline was 14%. the activity of tigecycline against streptococcus pneumoniae was high with mic(50) and mic(90) of 0.125 mg/l. conclusion: tigecycline showed good overall in vitro activity against gram-positive and gram-negative isolates, including both tetracycline-susceptible and resistant isolates. most non-susceptibility to tigecycline among enterobacteriaceae other than e. coli was i (6%), rather than r (<1%). this indicates a problem setting interpretive species-related tigecycline breakpoints for enterobacteriaceae other than e. coli.

TI  == susceptibility of gram-positive and -negative bacteria to novel nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle technology.
AB  == the rapidly evolving crisis of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms has contributed to the rise of patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial and community-acquired infections. therefore, innovative antimicrobial technology targeting mechanisms to which the bacteria are unlikely to evolve resistance is urgently needed. we have previously described a nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle (no-np) with efficacy against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and acinetobacter baumannii in vitro and in murine wound and abscess models. although the prior findings suggest that the no-np can be a useful therapeutic for skin and soft tissue infections, the antimicrobial spectrum of no-np has yet to be fully elucidated. in the current study, we investigated the efficacy of a no-np against several gram-positive and -negative  clinical isolates. we found that the no-np were uniformly active against all of the streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates examined, including strains that were both sensitive and resistant to commonly used antibiotics. we concluded that the no-np have the potential to serve as a novel broad spectrum antimicrobial agent.

TI  == [trends of antimicrobial resistance in microbial strains isolated from invasive infections in romania. experience of participation in earss (european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system), 2002-2008].
AB  == earss (european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system) is the biggest antimicrobial resistance surveillance project in the world financed from public finds, aiming to provide validated and comparable official data on antimicrobial  resistance of invasive microbial strains (isolated from blood and csf), belonging to 6 indicator bacterial species, i.e.: s. aureus, e. coli, e. faecium/faecalis,  str. pneumoniae, ps. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae. romania reported data to earss since 2002 so far. though the number of participating laboratories increased progressively from 12 to 35, the number of hospitals which reported for earss. as the number of strains included in the data base remained steady and relatively low. this issue is related to the particular position of romania in the european  context, in respect of the very low number of blood cultures performed in hospitals. our paper is presenting the trends of antimicrobial resistance in the  indicator strains in the 2002-2008 interval. during the 2002-2008 interval, romania reported to earss a total number of 1276 bacterial strains, distributed by species as follows: 513 s aureus, 369 e. coli, 128 streptococcus pneumoniae, 127 enterococcus spp.. 71 klebsiella pneumoniae, 68 pseudomonas aeruginosa. klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were reported, according to the  earss protocol, only for the 2005-2008 interval. it is difficult to describe trends, specially in enterococcus, streptococcus pneumonaie and the 2 species collected only since 2005, because of the low number of isolates, but there are several results that are supporting us to claim that antimicrobial resistance in  invasive isolates is a real problem in romanian hospitals, like in other central, southern and south eastern european countries: more than 25% of s. aureus strains resistant to methicilline, with more than 50% in some years, high aminoglycozides resistance in more than 70-80% of enterococcus faecium invasive strains, more than 80% of strains resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporines etc.

AB  == background and objective: more than 100000 japanese die of pneumonia every year.  the number of people residing in nursing homes is increasing with the ageing of the population. in 2005, the american thoracic society/infectious diseases society of america (ats/idsa) published important guidelines for the management of healthcare-associated pneumonia (hcap). in japan, however, the optimum strategy for management of hcap is still unclear. the purpose of this study was to clarify the clinical features of patients with hcap. methods: patients (n = 202) who were consecutively admitted with a diagnosis of acute pneumonia between  october 2007 and september 2009 were retrospectively evaluated. using the ats/idsa guidelines, patients were divided into three groups: a community-acquired pneumonia (cap) group (n = 123), a nursing home-acquired pneumonia (nhap) group (n = 46) and a hcap other than nhap (o-hcap) group (n = 33). these groups were then compared with respect to laboratory data, microbiological findings and mortality. results: thirty-day mortality in the nhap group (10.9%) tended to be higher than that in the cap group (3.3%) or the o-hcap group (0%). the pathogens most frequently identified were streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae in the cap group, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae in the nhap group, and s. pneumoniae and k. pneumoniae in the o-hcap group. conclusions: the nhap group was clinically different from the o-hcap group, based on bacteriological examination  and mortality rates. in order to accurately diagnose, and formulate optimum treatment strategies for japanese patients, the categories of hcap, as specified  in the ats/idsa guidelines, should not be applied directly either to patients with nhap or those with o-hcap.

TI  == assessment of an extraction protocol to detect the major mastitis-causing pathogens in bovine milk.
AB  == despite all efforts to control its spread, mastitis remains the most costly disease for dairy farmers worldwide. one key component of better control of this  disease is identification of the causative bacterial agent during udder infections in cows. mastitis is complex, however, given the diversity of pathogens that must be identified. development of a rapid and efficient bacterial species identification tool is thus necessary. this study was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of bacterial dna extraction for the automated molecular detection of major mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples  to complement traditional microbiological identification. extraction and detection procedures were designed and optimized to achieve detection in a respectable time frame, at a reasonable cost, and with a high throughput capacity. the following species were identified: staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, and klebsiella spp. (including klebsiella oxytoca and klebsiella pneumoniae). the detection procedure includes specific genomic dna amplification  by multiplex pcr for each species, separation by capillary electrophoresis, and laser-assisted automated detection. the specificity of the primers was assessed with a panel of bacteria representing mastitis-negative control species. the extraction protocol comprised multiple steps, starting with centrifugation for fat removal, followed by heating in the presence of a cation exchange resin to trap divalent ions. the analytical sensitivity was 100 cfu/ml for milk samples spiked with staph. aureus, strep. dysgalactiae, and e. coli, with a tendency for  k. pneumoniae. the detection limit was 500 cfu/ml for strep. uberis and strep. agalactiae. the overall diagnostic sensitivity (95.4%) and specificity (97.3%) were determined in a double-blind randomized assay by processing 172 clinical milk samples with microbiological characterization as the gold standard. when the physical nature of the milk samples was too altered, dna purification with a magnetic bead-based system was used. of the apparent false-positive samples, 5 were identified by specific microbiological analysis as true-positive staph. aureus co-infections, with further confirmation by ribosomal 16s sequencing. the  proposed methodology could, therefore, become an interesting tool for automated pcr detection of major mastitis pathogens in dairy cattle.

AB  == objectives: to document the spectrum of activity of ceftaroline, the active form  of the prodrug, ceftaroline fosamil, a new cephalosporin with anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcal activity, against a surveillance collection of clinical isolates obtained from the usa and europe during 2008-09.  methods: a selected group of species associated with community-acquired pneumonia (cap; 6496 of 17 326 monitored strains) were tested for susceptibility in a central laboratory using clsi broth microdilution methods. organisms were sampled from 55 medical centres, 27 in the usa and 28 (12 countries) in europe. ceftaroline and comparator agents were tested and interpretations of mic endpoints made by applying current clsi (2010) and eucast (2010) breakpoint criteria. results: against 1340 streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline inhibited all isolates at </=0.5 mg/l (mic(50/90), </=0.008/0.12 mg/l) and was 8-fold more  active than ceftriaxone (mic(90), 1 mg/l; only 79.2% coverage at eucast breakpoint). haemophilus influenzae (n = 584; mic(50/90), </=0.008/0.015 mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (n = 377; mic(50/90), 0.03-0.06/0.12 mg/l) and staphylococcus aureus (n = 590; mic(50/90), 0.5/1 mg/l) were very susceptible to  ceftaroline, regardless of beta-lactamase production or multidrug resistance (mdr) patterns. the potency of ceftaroline against three species of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae) was similar to that of ceftriaxone, ceftazidime and piperacillin/tazobactam. only modest differences in rates of ceftaroline susceptibility (breakpoint </=2 mg/l) were noted with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-negative enterobacteriaceae strains between the usa and europe (97.9% versus 97.0% for e. coli). ceftaroline, like ceftriaxone, was not active against ceftazidime-resistant e. coli (10.2%-26.2% susceptible at </=2 mg/l) or k. pneumoniae (5.3%-11.2%). conclusions: the ceftaroline surveillance for 2008-09 (usa and europe) documented low mic(50/90) values for s. aureus isolates at 0.5/1 and 0.25/1 mg/l, respectively. more importantly, ceftaroline mic(90) results for  s. pneumoniae (0.12 mg/l), h. influenzae (0.015 mg/l) and m. catarrhalis (0.12 mg/l) were very low, all mics being </=0.5 mg/l. ceftaroline exhibited promising  high potency and wide coverage against gram-positive and -negative pathogens known to cause cap, especially isolates of mdr pneumococci and methicillin-resistant s. aureus.

TI  == sitafloxacin: in bacterial infections.
AB  == sitafloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial with in vitro activity against a  broad range of gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including anaerobic bacteria, as well as against atypical pathogens. it is approved in japan for use  in a number of bacterial infections caused by sitafloxacin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococcus spp., enterococcus spp., moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus spp., morganella morganii, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, legionella pneumophila, peptostreptococcus spp., prevotella spp., porphyromonas spp., fusobacterium spp., chlamydia trachomatis, chlamydophila pneumoniae and mycoplasma pneumoniae. in terms of clinical efficacy, oral sitafloxacin was noninferior to oral levofloxacin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia or an infectious exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract disease, noninferior to oral tosufloxacin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, and noninferior to oral levofloxacin in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, according to the results of randomized, double-blind, multicentre, noninferiority trials. noncomparative studies demonstrated the efficacy of oral sitafloxacin in  otorhinolaryngological infections, urethritis in men, c. trachomatis-associated cervicitis in women and odontogenic infections. gastrointestinal disorders and laboratory abnormalities were the most commonly occurring adverse reactions in patients receiving oral sitafloxacin. adverse reactions reported in sitafloxacin  recipients in the active comparator trials were of mild to moderate severity.

TI  == ultra-fast and sensitive detection of non-typhoidal salmonella using microwave-accelerated metal-enhanced fluorescence ("mamef").
AB  == certain serovars of salmonella enterica subsp. enterica cause invasive disease (e.g., enteric fever, bacteremia, septicemia, meningitis, etc.) in humans and constitute a global public health problem. a rapid, sensitive diagnostic test is  needed to allow prompt initiation of therapy in individual patients and for measuring disease burden at the population level. an innovative and promising new rapid diagnostic technique is microwave-accelerated metal-enhanced fluorescence (mamef). we have adapted this assay platform to detect the chromosomal oric locus common to all salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovars. we have shown efficient lysis of biologically relevant concentrations of salmonella spp. suspended in bacteriological media using microwave-induced lysis. following lysis and dna release, as little as 1 cfu of salmonella in 1 ml of medium can be detected in <30 seconds. furthermore the assay is sensitive and specific: it can  detect oric from salmonella serovars typhi, paratyphi a, paratyphi b, paratyphi c, typhimurium, enteritidis and choleraesuis but does not detect escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae or acinetobacter baumanii. we have also performed preliminary experiments using a synthetic salmonella oric oligonucleotide suspended in whole human blood and observed rapid detection when the sample was diluted 1:1 with pbs. these pre-clinical data encourage progress to the next step to detect salmonella in blood (and other ordinarily sterile, clinically relevant  body fluids).

TI  == phytochemical screening and antibacterial activities of vernonia ambigua, vernonia blumeoides and vernonia oocephala (asteraceae).
AB  == some vernonia species (vernonia ambigua, vernonia blumeoides and vernonia oocephala) used in northern nigerian traditional medicine, were subjected to phytochemical screening using standard procedures. the antibacterial activity using the disc diffusion method as outlined by the nccls was carried out on klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, corynbacterium ulcerans, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, shigella dysentriae, proteus mirabilis  and pseudomonas fluorescence. the results of the antibacterial activity as indicated by zone of growth inhibition ranged from 14 to 27 mm for the crude ethanol extracts and chloroform fractions of the vernonia species being studied.  the activity of chloroform fraction of v. blumeoides was higher on c. ulcerans and k. pneumoniae (27 mm), while the chloroform fractions of v. oocephala and v.  ambigua were more active on p. mirabilis (27 mm) and s. typhi (22 mm), respectively. it is worth of mention that the chloroform fractions of the three vernonia species demonstrated activity (20 mm) against mrsa. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values ranged from 1.25-2.5 mg/ml for all the organisms tested. the mic of 1.25 mg/ml exhibited by the chloroform fractions on  both gram positive and negative bacteria indicates broad spectrumactivity of the  vernonia species being studied. phytochemical screening of the extracts/fractions revealed the presence of steroids/terpenes, saponins, flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins and glycosides. the antibacterial activity exhibited in this study may be attributed to flavonoids, saponinss or sesquiterpene lactones. the overall results indicate that the extracts/fractions are potent antibacterial preparations at least in vitro. this lends credence to the use of these plants for the treatment of various infectious diseases.

TI  == pyogenic liver abscess: an audit of 10 years' experience.
AB  == aim: to describe our own experience with pyogenic liver abscesses over the past 10 years and investigate the risk factors associated with failure of initial percutaneous therapy. methods: a retrospective study of records of 63 pla patients presenting between 1998 and 2008 to australian tertiary referral centre, were reviewed. amoebic and hydatid abscesses were excluded. demographic, clinical, radiological, and microbiological characteristics, as well as surgical/radiological interventions, were recorded. results: sixty-three patients (42 males, 21 females) aged 65 (+/- 14) years [mean +/- (sd)] had prodromal symptoms for a median (interquartile range; iqr) of 7 (5-14) d. only 59% of patients were febrile at presentation; however, the serum c-reactive protein was  elevated in all 47 in whom it was measured. liver function tests were non-specifically abnormal. 67% of patients had a solitary abscess, while 32% had  > 3 abscesses with a median (iqr) diameter of 6.3 (4-9) cm. causative organisms were: streptococcus milleri 25%, klebsiella pneumoniae 21%, and escherichia coli  16%. a presumptive cryptogenic cause was most common (34%). four patients died in this series: one from sepsis, two from advanced cancer, and one from acute myocardial infarction. the initial procedure was radiological aspiration +/- drainage in 54 and surgery in two patients. 17% underwent surgical management during their hospitalization. serum hypoalbuminaemia [mean (95% ci): 32 (29-35) g/l vs 28 (25-31) g/l, p = 0.045] on presentation was found to be the only factor related to failure of initial percutaneous therapy on univariate analysis. conclusion: pla is a diagnostic challenge, because the presentation of this condition is non-specific. intravenous antibiotics and radiological drainage in the first instance allows resolution of most plas; however, a small proportion of patients still require surgical drainage.

TI  == hydroalcoholic extract based-ointment from punica granatum l. peels with enhanced in vivo healing potential on dermal wounds.
AB  == the present study reports for the first time, the in vivo wound healing potential of punica granatum l. peels. a 5% (w/w) methanolic extract based-ointment was formulated and evaluated for its wound healing in guinea pigs. the ointment was applied in vivo on the paravertebral area of twelve excised wounded models once a day for 10 consecutive days. the ointment significantly enhanced the wound contraction and the period of epithelialization as assessed by the mechanical (contraction rate, tensile strength), the biochemical (increasing of collagen, dna and proteins synthesis) and the histopathological characteristics. such investigation was encouraged by the efficiency of the methanolic extract as antimicrobial and antioxidant. indeed, the extract showed antioxidant activity as strong as natural and synthetic compounds (trolox, bha, quercetin). furthermore,  the extract exhibited significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all tested bacteria: pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 9027, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, escherichia coli atcc 25922, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella anatum, salmonella typhimurium, streptococcus pneumoniae, and fungi candida albicans, candida glabrata, trichopyton rubrum and aspergillus niger. the formulated ointment might well find use as skin repair agent without hazard to human health based on these results and on the fact that it has been well established that the extracts of pomegranate used in conditions similar to those  applied by traditional medicine, showed no toxic effects.

TI  == plasma concentrations resulting from florfenicol preparations given to pigs in their drinking water.
AB  == florfenicol administered through the drinking water has been recommended as a metaphylactic antibacterial drug to control outbreaks of respiratory diseases in  pigs caused by strains of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and pasteurella multocida, yet it is difficult to pinpoint in practice when the drug is given metaphylactically or therapeutically. further, pigs are likely to reject florfenicol-medicated water, and plasma concentrations of the drug are likely to  be marginal for diseases caused by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus. the reported minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for these organisms show a breakpoint of 2 to 3 mug/ml. an experiment was conducted during september and october 2009. one hundred twenty healthy crossbred pigs (landrace-yorkshire), weighing 23 +/- 6.2 kg, were used in this trial. they  were randomly assigned to 5 groups, with 3 replicates of 8 animals/group. two commercial preparations of florfenicol were administered through the drinking water at 2 concentrations (0.01 and 0.015%). water intake was measured before and after medication, and plasma concentrations of florfenicol were determined by hplc. considerable rejection of florfenicol-medicated water was observed. however, plasma florfenicol concentrations were of a range sufficient for a methaphylaxis approach to preventing disease by bacteria, with mic breakpoints of </= 0.25 mug/ml. decreased efficacy as a metaphylactic medication should be expected for bacteria with mic >0.25 mug/ml, considering the reported existence of bacteria resistant to florfenicol and the natural resistance of streptococcus  suis or e. coli to this drug.

AB  == plants that belong to the combretaceae family have long history of use in the traditional medicine systems of africa and asia for treatment of diseases and conditions associated with hiv/aids-opportunistic infections. the objective of this study was to investigate the biological activities of extracts of terminalia stenostachya engl. & diels and terminalia spinosa engl. (combretaceae), to verify the rationale for their use by traditional health practitioners in the treatment  of hiv/aids patients in tanzania. extracts of the leaves, stem barks and roots of t. stenostachya and extracts of stem barks and roots of t. spinosa have all shown strong activity against a number of standard microbial strains including mycobacterium madagascariense and mycobacterium indicus pranii, streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, vibrio cholera, bacillus anthracis, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhi, pseuodomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. all extracts from the two plant species showed strong antimycobacterial activity against test organisms. the stem and root bark extracts were more active than leaves against both gram positive and negative bacteria. with the exception of two extracts from stem barks of t. spinosa, all other extracts from t. stenostachya and t. spinosa that were tested exhibited less activity against brine shrimp larvae with lc50 values >/= 100 mug/ml compared to cyclophosphamide, a standard anticancer drug. these results provide an indication that these plants may possess therapeutically potent antimicrobial  compounds worth further development.

TI  == streptococcus mutans glnk protein: an unusual pii family member.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is a gram-positive bacterium present in the oral cavity, and is considered to be one of the leading causes of dental caries. s. mutans has a glnk gene, which codes for a pii-like protein that is possibly involved in the integration of carbon, nitrogen and energy metabolism in several organisms. to characterize the glnk protein of s. mutans, the glnk gene was amplified by pcr, and cloned into the expression vectors pet29a(+) and pet28b(+). the native glnk-sm was purified by anion exchange (q-sepharose) and affinity (hi-trap heparin) chromatography. the glnk-his-sm protein was purified using a hi-trap chelating-ni2+ column. the molecular mass of the glnk-his-sm proteins was 85 kda  as determined by gel filtration, indicating that this protein is a hexamer in solution. the glnk-his-sm protein is not uridylylated by the escherichia coli glnd protein. the activities of the glnk-sm and glnk-his-sm proteins were assayed in e. coli constitutively expressing the klebsiella pneumoniae nifla operon. in k. pneumoniae, nifl inhibits nifa activity in the presence of high ammonium levels and the glnk protein is required to reduce the inhibition of nifl in the presence of low ammonium levels. the glnk-sm protein was unable to reduce nifl inhibition of nifa protein. surprisingly, the glnk-his-sm protein was able to partially reduce nifl inhibition of the nifa protein under nitrogen-limiting conditions, in a manner similar to the glnk protein of e. coli. these results suggested that s. mutans glnk is functionally different from e. coli pii proteins.

TI  == changing trends in antimicrobial resistance of major bacterial pathogens, 1985-2005: a study from a medical center in northern taiwan.
AB  == background: antimicrobial resistance is a major health problem worldwide. we evaluated the antimicrobial resistance trends of 16 major bacterial pathogens at  a tertiary medical center in northern taiwan. methods: we conducted a retrospective review of annual summary documents for antimicrobial susceptibility of clinically isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria from 1985 to 2005. the numbers of isolates and susceptibilities were calculated for three 7-year periods: first period, 1985-1991; second period, 1992-1998; and the third  period, 1999-2005. results: during the 21-year period, 219,715 bacterial pathogens were identified. a significant increase in incidence over time was found for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s epidermidis, penicillin-nonsusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, erythromycin-resistant s pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, cefotaxime/ceftriaxone-resistant escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, and  imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. additionally, a significant increase  in ciprofloxacin resistance rates over time from 1996 to 2005 was noted for e coli, enterobacter cloacae, and a baumannii (through 1997 to 2005). however, a significant decrease in erythromycin resistance rate with time from 1999 to 2005  was found for groups a and b streptococci, non-a, b, d streptococci, and s pneumoniae. conclusion: resistance to antimicrobial agents increased rapidly in the past two decades in taiwan and has become very common in major bacterial pathogens. continuous enforcement of policies to limit use of antimicrobial agents and active surveillance of antimicrobial resistance through a nationwide system are both warranted.

AB  == although hemodialysis-associated pneumonia (hdap) was included among the healthcare-associated pneumonias (hcap) in the 2005 american thoracic society (ats)/infectious diseases society of america (idsa) guideline, little information relevant to clinical epidemiology, especially microbiological characteristics, is available. this study aimed to reveal microbiological characteristics and clinical outcomes of hdap and to assess whether hdap should be included in the hcap category. we retrospectively analyzed 69 hdap patients [42 with moderate and 27 with severe disease based on a-drop (age, dehydration, respiratory failure, orientation disturbance, and low blood pressure)] in whom sputum cultures were performed at our hospital between 2007 and 2009. the most common pathogens were staphylococcus aureus (37.7%), which were composed of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) (27.5%) and methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa) (10.1%), followed by streptococcus pneumoniae (10.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (8.7%), haemophilus influenzae (7.2%), and moraxella catarrhalis (5.8%). this distribution mostly resembled the microbiological characteristics of hcap reported previously, except that the frequency of multi-drug-resistant (mdr) gram negatives such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9%) was clearly lower and that of mrsa was higher. there were no significant differences in microbiological findings, including the incidence of mdr pathogens, between the two severity groups. despite most cases (82.6%) receiving only monotherapy, the prognosis (30-day survival and in-hospital mortality rates were 88.4% and, 17.4%, respectively) was similar to the past hcap reports, but there were no significant correlations between prognosis and presence of mdr pathogens (30-day mortality rates 18.2% in mdr positive vs. 8.5% in mdr negative; p = 0.242). assessment for  not only mdr pathogens, but also severity of illness by the a-drop system made it possible to conduct stratification based on prognosis. our results suggest that hdap should be included in the hcap category, while understanding that there are  some differences.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the canward 2007-2009 study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. all  staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (mic(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/ml and 2 mug/ml, respectively). ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), </=  0.06 mug/ml), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic(90), </= 0.06 mug/ml), staphylococcus epidermidis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml), and enterococcus faecalis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml). over 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/ml. ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and k. pneumoniae. the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus  pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (mic(90), 16 mug/ml). the  broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.

TI  == antimicrobial drug resistance in taiwan.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance is a major global health threat associated with high mortality rates and high medical costs. geographic variations in resistance profiles of bacterial and fungal pathogens have had a considerable impact on antimicrobial prescription. in taiwan, there is an alarmingly high prevalence of  penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant (xdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae, penicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant neisseria gonorrhoeae, and azole-resistant candida species. in addition, the emergence of xdr mycobacterium  tuberculosis has illustrated the need for regular monitoring of the resistance profiles of clinical isolates. a few clones of xdr a. baumannii and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus of unique sequence type (st 59) have  disseminated in taiwanese hospital settings. besides, the existence of a transposon-harboring carbapenemase gene has been verified in xdr p aeruginosa strains throughout taiwan. an end to the worsening trends in the emergence of antimicrobial resistance will require continuous survey of resistance data from clinical isolates and effective implementation of strict infection control policies in healthcare settings and animal husbandry.

TI  == prevalence of hospital-acquired enterococci infections in two primary-care hospitals in osogbo, southwestern nigeria.
AB  == enterococci are opportunistic bacteria that become pathogenic when they colonize  niches where they are not normally found. of recent, they have become major cause of nosocomial infections, especially of the bloodstream, urinary tract and surgical sites. the aim of this study is to determine the point-prevalence rate of human enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in osogbo, nigeria. the study was conducted between january and june 2009 in two primary-care hospitals in osogbo and involved a total of 118 patients who developed clinical evidence of infection at least 48 hours after hospital admission. appropriate clinical samples were collected from the patients after an informed consent and cultured for isolation/biochemical identification of enterococcus species at the  bacteriology laboratory of ladoke akintola university of technology, osogbo using standard microbiological methods. there were 525 hospital admissions within the time frame of the study of which 118 (22.5%) developed hospital acquired infection (hai); 58 (49.2%) of which cultured positive for bacterial pathogens. enterococci were isolated from infective focus in 7 patients, giving a prevalence rate of hospital-acquired enterococci infection of 5.9%. two species of enterococcus were identified; enterococcus faecalis from urinary tract infection  (uti) and surgical site infection (ssi) of 6 (85.7%) patients and enterococcus faecium from uti in 1 (14.3%) patient. other bacteria recovered from other infective foci were klebsiella spp 31.0%, pseudomonas spp 20.7%, staphylococcus aureus 17.2%, escherichia coli 12.1%, staphylococcus epidermidis 3.4%, streptococcus pneumoniae 1.7% and serratia spp 1.7%. all the enterococci isolates were multiply antibiotic resistant, and 42.9% were vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) with the vre strains showing resistance to wider range of antibiotics than the vancomycin-sensitive strains. other gram-positive and gram negative bacterial isolates also demonstrated multiple resistance to all commonly available antibiotics in this community except e. coli and pseudomonas spp which  were relatively sensitive to ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime. this limited study demonstrated a high prevalence rate of multiple antibiotic resistant enterococci  infections among hospitalized patients in this environment. there is need for systematic surveillance of hospitals for enterococci infections; prudent use and  rational prescription of antibiotics and stringent measures to reduce the prevalence rate by health education on infection control measures such as isolation, cleaning, disinfection and sterilization.

AB  == due to technical problems, biofilm biomasses are difficult to be precisely determined. one reliable strategy is based on the colorimetry of formazan compounds derived from tetrazolium salt reduction. xtt presents some desirable properties that make the biofilm measurements easier. however, cells entrapped within the extracellular matrixes normally do not metabolize the tetrazolium equally, leading to underestimation of cell contents. this study evaluated the effectiveness of d-glutamine, a plerotic substrate of tricarboxilic acid cycle (tac), as inducer of xtt reduction. the metabolic activities of aerobic and anaerobic 48 h-old monospecific biofilms of pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc(r)27853,  klebsiella pneumoniae atcc(r)13883, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc(r)12228, streptococcus mutans atcc(r)25175, and candida albicans sc5314 were evaluated. results showed that d-glutamine 50 mm (for p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and s. epidermidis) and 25 mm (for s. mutans and c. albicans) may enhance the detection  of soluble formazan in a significant manner, what becomes the xtt reduction assay more robust.

TI  == phytochemical investigations of stemona curtisii and synthetic studies on stemocurtisine alkaloids.
AB  == the isolation of two new stemona alkaloids, 1-hydroxyprotostemonine and stemocurtisine n-oxide, and a new benzofuran, stemofuran l, from the root extracts of stemona curtisii is reported. the major known alkaloids from this plant extract, stemocurtisine, stemocurtisinol, and oxyprotostemonine, were also  isolated along with oxystemokerrine n-oxide. the nonalkaloid components of this extract included a new benzofuran derivative, stemofuran l, the known stemofurans f, j, and k, dihydro-gamma-tocopherol, and stigmasterol. stemocurtisine and stemocurtisinol were converted to their respective n-oxides by oxidation. stemocurtisine was converted to a tetracyclic derivative by oxidative cleavage of the gamma-butyrolactone ring, while stemocurtisinol gave a novel lactam derivative by oxidative cleavage of the c-4 side chain under basic conditions. the acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities of some known and new alkaloids and their derivatives are also reported. all were 10-20 times less active as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors than the pyrrolo[1,2-a]azepine stemona alkaloids  stemofoline and 1',2'-didehydrostemofoline. none of the stemofuran compounds showed significant antibacterial or antifungal activities.

TI  == bacteremic community-acquired pneumonia due to klebsiella pneumoniae: clinical and microbiological characteristics in taiwan, 2001-2008.
AB  == background: klebsiella pneumoniae is the major cause of community-acquired pyogenic infections in taiwan. this retrospective study evaluated the clinical and microbiological characteristics of bacteremic community-acquired pneumonia due to k. pneumoniae in taiwanese adults. methods: the clinical characteristics of bacteremic community-acquired pneumonia (cap) in adults due to k. pneumoniae were compared to those of adults with bacteremic cap due to streptococcus pneumoniae at a tertiary medical center in taiwan from 2001-2008. risk factors for mortality of bacteremic cap due to k. pneumoniae were analyzed. all clinical  isolates of k. pneumoniae were examined for capsular serotypes, hypermucoviscosity phenotype, aerobactin and rmpa gene. results: k. pneumoniae was the dominant cause of bacteremic cap and was associated with a more fulminant course and a worse prognosis than bacteremic cap due to streptococcus pneumoniae. initial presentation with septic shock and respiratory failure were independent risk factors for both early and total mortality. serotype k1 and k2 comprised around half of all isolates. there were no significant differences in the clinical characteristics of patients with bacteremic cap due to k1/k2 and non-k1/k2 isolates. hypermucoviscosity phenotype as well as the aerobactin and rmpa genes were highly prevalent in the k. pneumoniae isolates. conclusions: k. pneumoniae continued to be the dominant cause of bacteremic cap in taiwanese adults during 2001-2008. initial presentation with septic shock and respiratory failure were independent risk factors for both early and total mortality from k.  pneumoniae bacteremic cap. serotypes k1/k2 comprised around half of all isolates, but did not predispose patients to a poor clinical outcome. physicians should be  aware of the poor prognosis of any patient with bacteremic k. pneumoniae cap and  monitor these patients more closely.

TI  == non-antibiotics reverse resistance of bacteria to antibiotics.
AB  == background: most clinical isolates that exhibit a multi-drug resistant phenotype  owe that resistance to over-expressed efflux pumps. compounds that are efflux pump inhibitors (epis) reduce or reverse resistance to antibiotics to which the bacterial strain is initially resistant. we have evaluated non-antibiotics to reduce resistance of commonly encountered bacterial pathogens to antibiotics. materials and methods: the effect of non-antibiotics on the susceptibility of bacteria to antibiotics was conducted by minimum inhibition concentration determinations of the antibiotic in the absence and presence of the non-antibiotic. results: non-antibiotics such as chlorpromazine, amitryptiline and trans-chlorprothixene are shown to reduce or reverse resistance of a variety  of bacteria to antibiotics. conclusion: the results suggest that non-antibiotics  may serve as adjuncts to conventional antibiotics for the therapy of problematic  antibiotic infections caused by bacteria that owe their resistance to over-expressed efflux pumps.

TI  == in vivo antibacterial activity of nemonoxacin, a novel non-fluorinated quinolone.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the in vivo antibacterial efficacy of nemonoxacin, a novel c8-methoxy non-fluorinated quinolone in murine systemic and local infection models. methods: the efficacy of nemonoxacin in systemic infections was evaluated in mouse peritonitis models using isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa, n=1), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa, n=1), methicillin- and levofloxacin-resistant staphylococcus capitis (levofloxacin-resistant mrsc, n=1), penicillin-intermediate streptococcus pneumoniae (pisp, n=1), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp, n=2), enterococcus faecalis (n=2, including 1 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, vre) and escherichia coli (n=3). the local infections included mouse pulmonary infections caused by prsp (n=1), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1) and mouse ascending  urinary tract infection caused by e. coli (n=1). results: in the mouse systemic infection model, nemonoxacin demonstrated potent activity against mssa (ed(50) =2.08 mg/kg), mrsa (ed(50) =2.59 mg/kg), levofloxacin-resistant mrsc (ed(50) =2.52 mg/kg), pisp (ed(50) =5.47 mg/kg), prsp (ed(50) =3.68-5.28 mg/kg) and e. coli (ed(50) =3.13-5.28 mg/kg), and moderate activity towards e. faecalis infection (ed(50) =8.48-15.16 mg/kg). the therapeutic efficacy of nemonoxacin was significantly higher (p<0.01) than that of levofloxacin in infections caused by gram-positive isolates (mssa, mrsa, levofloxacin-resistant mrsc, pisp, prsp and e. faecalis), but less potent than that of levofloxacin against e. coli infection (p<0.01). nemonoxacin in vivo efficacy results with gram-positive isolates (2- to 5-fold ed(50) advantage over levofloxacin) are consistent with the mic data (4- to 16-fold mic advantage of nemonoxacin over levofloxacin). in the mouse pulmonary infection model, nemonoxacin showed potent activity towards prsp (higher than levofloxacin) and k. pneumoniae (lower than levofloxacin) infections. in the mouse ascending urinary tract infection model, nemonoxacin exhibited potent activity against e. coli infection (lower than levofloxacin). conclusions: the results validated the potent efficacy of nemonoxacin in vivo. the higher efficacy of nemonoxacin than of levofloxacin towards infections caused by gram-positive cocci (especially mrsa, levofloxacin-resistant mrsc, prsp and vre) warrants investigation of its clinical use.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of sodium citrate against streptococcus pneumoniae and several oral bacteria.
AB  == aims: the aim of this study is to assess the antibacterial activity of sodium citrate against streptococcus pneumoniae and several oral bacteria. methods and results: the antibacterial activity was determined by broth microdilution method. the results showed that although enterocuccus faecium ob7084 and klebsiella pneumoniae ob7088 had high tolerance to sodium citrate, several oral bacteria including fusobacterium nucleatum jcm8532(t) , streptococcus mutans jcm5705(t) and strep. pneumoniae nbrc102642(t) were susceptible. furthermore, the bactericidal activity of sodium citrate against strep. pneumoniae nbrc102642(t) was not influenced by ph in the range of 5.0-8.0, whereas that of sodium lactate  was weakened at neutral or weak alkaline ph. when strep. pneumoniae nbrc102642(t) was treated with sodium citrate for 2 h, many burst cells were observed. however, addition of mgcl(2) or cacl(2) to an assay medium weakened the antimicrobial activity although zncl(2) or mncl(2) did not influence. conclusions: independent  of ph, sodium citrate inhibited the growth of oral bacteria, which suggests that  the mechanism is different from that of sodium lactate. significance and impact of the study: the results presented in this study would be available for understanding the antimicrobial property of sodium citrate.

AB  == objective: to study the association of tumor necrosis factor-a (tnf-a) and c--reactive protein (crp) with microbiologically documented cases of sepsis versus clinically documented cases of sepsis. materials and methods: seventy nine pediatric patients with sepsis were studied. relevant specimens were processed for bacterial or fungal etiology. tnf-a was detected by enzyme immunoassay and crp was detected by latex agglutination. thirty healthy cases were included in the study to establish baseline tnf-alpha levels. results: forty two (53.2%) patients had a microbiologically documented sepsis. among gram negative bacilli escherichia coli was the most common isolate followed by klebsiella spp. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae predominated among the gram positive cocci. patients with a positive culture had significantly higher tnf-alpha levels than patients with a negative culture (70 pg/ml vs. 33 pg/ml p < 0.01). further, pure gram negative infection correlated with significantly higher tnf-alpha levels than pure (p < 0.01) gram positive infection. the crp values did not highlight these differences significantly. conclusions: tnf-alpha level was significantly raised in patients with sepsis. tnf-a levels were raised significantly in culture positive cases in general and in gram negative infections in particular. serum tnf-alpha was a more sensitive marker for different categories of sepsis compared to crp and microbiology culture.

TI  == overview perspective of bacterial resistance.
AB  == the rapidly escalating prevalence of antimicrobial resistance is a global concern. this reduced susceptibility to currently available antimicrobial agents  coupled with the progressive shortage of newly approved compounds is a worrisome  situation. major problems are encountered for a growing number of gram-positive (i.e., staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus spp.) and gram-negative pathogens (i.e., pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae). we provide an overview of bacterial resistance focusing on the most common pathogens responsible for infection in both the community and  healthcare settings. in addition, several strategies to curb antimicrobial resistance are also discussed. it is increasingly evident that without the introduction of novel antimicrobial agents, a return to the clinical outcomes associated with the pre-antibiotic era are inevitable.

TI  == a report from the 20th european congress of clinical microbiology and infectious  diseases (april 10-13, 2010 - vienna, austria).
AB  == effective antimicrobials currently in use in europe and throughout the world are  fast losing ground as many pathogens acquire resistance to newly introduced drugs. multidrug and panresistance have now been identified in many pathogens, as iteratively discussed throughout this year's meeting of the european congress of  clinical microbiology and infectious diseases (eccmid). as extensively discussed  in an oral session entitled worldwide dissemination of resistances by 10 specialists from across europe and the world, important drug resistances have now been identified in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumanii and virtually all known pathogens (roede, b.m. et al., abst o127; huenger, f. et al., abst o395; mera, r.m. et al., abst o483). while many other issues were discussed, including the role of healthcare professionals  and of hand hygiene in controlling the spread of infections (derde, l. et al., abst o464), microbial resistance was indeed the main topic of discussion in the many oral and poster presentations at the austria center in vienna. the war against the superbugs has been declared and initiatives have been taken for tracking and destroying difficult to treat pathogens. treatments of the diseases  caused by these multidrug- and panresistant organisms continue, as manifested by  new research and population surveys. however, with antimicrobial resistances as leitmotiv background music, other very recent scientific achievements and findings in diagnostics and treatment for infectious diseases took center stage in vienna, including important information on novel drugs for infectious diseases and the use and comparative effectiveness of extant drugs, as summarized in the following report.

TI  == bacteriological and clinical profile of community acquired pneumonia in hospitalized patients.
AB  == the aim of our study was to obtain comprehensive insight into the bacteriological and clinical profile of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization. the patient population consisted of 100 patients admitted with the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (cap), as defined by british thoracic society, from  december 1998 to dec 2000, at the sher- i-kashmir institute of medical sciences soura, srinagar, india. gram negative organisms were the commonest cause (19/29), followed by gram positive (10/29). in 71 cases no etiological cause was obtained. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the commonest pathogen (10/29), followed by staphylococcus aureus (7/29), escherichia coli (6/29), klebsiella spp. (3/29), streptococcus pyogenes (1/29), streptococcus pneumoniae (1/29) and acinetobacter  spp. (1/29). sputum was the most common etiological source of organism isolation  (26) followed by blood (6), pleural fluid (3), and pus culture (1). maximum number of patients presented with cough (99%), fever (95%), tachycardia (92%), pleuritic chest pain (75%), sputum production (65%) and leucocytosis (43%). the commonest predisposing factors were smoking (65%), copd (57%), structural lung disease (21%), diabetes mellitus (13%), and decreased level of consciousness following seizure (eight per cent) and chronic alcoholism (one per cent). fourteen patients, of whom, nine were males and five females, died. staphylococcus aureus was the causative organism in four, pseudomonas in two, klebsiella in one, and no organism was isolated in seven cases. the factors predicting mortality at admission were - age over 62 years, history of copd or smoking, hypotension, altered sensorium, respiratory failure, leucocytosis, and staphylococcus pneumonia and undetermined etiology. the overall rate of identification of microbial etiology of community-acquired pneumonia was 29%, which is very low, and if serological tests for legionella, mycoplasma and viruses are performed the diagnostic yield would definitely be better. this emphasizes the need for further studies (including the serological tests for legionella, mycoplasma and viruses) to identify the microbial etiology of cap.

TI  == antibacterial properties of tualang honey and its effect in burn wound management: a comparative study.
AB  == background: the use of honey as a natural product of apis spp. for burn treatment has been widely applied for centuries. tualang honey has been reported to have antibacterial properties against various microorganisms, including those from burn-related diagnoses, and is cheaper and easier to be absorbed by aquacel dressing. the aim of this study is to evaluate the potential antibacterial properties of tualang honey dressing and to determine its effectiveness as a partial thickness burn wound dressing. methods: in order to quantitate the bioburden of the swabs, pour plates were performed to obtain the colony count (cfu/ml). swabs obtained from burn wounds were streaked on blood agar and macconkey agar for bacterial isolation and identification. later, antibacterial activity of aquacel-tualang honey, aquacel-manuka honey, aquacel-ag and aquacel-  plain dressings against bacteria isolated from patients were tested (in-vitro) to see the effectiveness of those dressings by zone of inhibition assays. results: seven organisms were isolated. four types of gram-negative bacteria, namely enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas spp. and acinetobacter spp., and three gram-positive bacteria, namely staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus aureus (cons) and streptococcus spp., were isolated. total bacterial count decreased on day 6 and onwards. in the in-vitro antibacterial study, aquacel-ag and aquacel-manuka honey dressings gave better zone of inhibition for gram positive bacteria compared to aquacel-tualang honey dressing. however, comparable results were obtained against gram negative bacteria tested with aquacel-manuka honey and aquacel-tualang honey dressing. conclusions: tualang honey has a bactericidal as well as bacteriostatic effect. it is useful as a dressing, as it is easier to apply and is less sticky compared  to manuka honey. however, for gram positive bacteria, tualang honey is not as effective as usual care products such as silver-based dressing or medical grade honey dressing.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of respiratory pathogens recently isolated in italy: focus on cefditoren.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antibiotic susceptibility of respiratory pathogens recently isolated in italy to commonly used antibiotics including cefditoren. six clinical microbiological laboratories collected, between january and september 2009, a total of 2,510 respiratory pathogens from subjects with community-acquired respiratory tract infections (carti). ceftditoren, out of all the beta-lactams studied, had the lowest mic(90 )against  965 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae examined, followed by cefotaxime and ceftriaxone (2% resistance in penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp)). against 470 haemophilus influenzae , independently of their production of beta-lactamases or ampicillin resistance, cefditoren was the oral cephalosporin with the best in  vitro activity, comparable to that of the injectable cephalosporins and levofloxacin. higher mic(90)s were found for the macrolides (4 - 16 mg/l) and cefaclor (4 - 32 mg/l). as was foreseeable, streptococcus pyogenes (225 strains)  was uniformly sensitive to all the beta-lactam antibiotics, but the elevated mic(90 )values reduced (<75%) susceptibility of this pathogen to macrolides. beta-lactamase-negative moraxella catarrhalis (100 strains) had reduced susceptibility only to the macrolides, while the 250 beta-lactamase-producing strains also had reduced susceptibility to cefuroxime. levofloxacin showed the lowest mic(50)/mic(90 )values in the producing strains, whereas cefditoren, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone in the non-producers. as regards the enterobacteriaceae, cefditoren and levofloxacin had the lowest mic(90)s against klebsiella pneumoniae. cefditoren and the third-generation injectable cephalosporins had the lowest mic(90)s against escherichia coli (100% susceptibility) while levofloxacin was less active (86% susceptibility).in conclusion, cefditoren's wide spectrum and high intrinsic activity, as well as its capacity to overcome most of the resistance that has become consolidated in some classes of antibiotics widely used as empiric therapy for carti, allows us to suggest that cefditoren might be included in the european guidelines as one of the first-choice antibiotics in the treatment of carti.

TI  == [immunization and bacterial pathogens in the oropharynx as risk factors for alopecia areata].
AB  == introduction: alopecia areata is an autoimmune inflammatory disease affecting the hair follicles. researchers are currently interested in whether the presence of bacterial pathogens and/or a history of immunization can trigger an autoimmune response in patients who are genetically predisposed. objectives: this study aimed to determine whether there is an association between the development of alopecia areata and throat carriage of bacterial pathogens or a history of immunization. material and methods: sixty-five men and women with alopecia areata and 65 control patients with other skin diseases were studied at the dr ladislao  de la pascua dermatology clinic between september 2008 and february 2009. the patients ranged in age from 18-59 years. patients with scalp diseases were excluded from the control group. in all cases, the patient was questioned about immunizations received in the previous 6 months, and a throat swab was cultured.  results: a history of immunization (odds ratio [or], 3.3; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.6-6.7; p=.001), the presence of bacterial pathogens in the oropharynx (or, 2.6; 95% ci, 1.1-6.2; p=.033), and being a carrier of streptococcus pyogenes (or, 2.1; 95% ci, 1.7-2.5; p=.042) were risk factors for alopecia areata. klebsiella pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, serratia marcescens and escherichia coli were isolated from cultures. conclusions: this is the first study to show an association between alopecia areata and throat carriage of bacterial pathogens or history of immunization, as  risk factors for development of the disease. given the characteristics of our study population, the association appears valid for patients with less than 25% hair loss and a course of disease under 1 year.

TI  == pyogenic liver abscess: differences in etiology and treatment in southeast asia and central europe.
AB  == knowledge of etiology and timely treatment of underlying causes, when possible, play an important role in the successful therapy of patients with pyogenic liver  abscess (pla). recent publications from central europe and southeast asia hint at considerable differences in etiology. in this article, we aim to elaborate these  differences and their therapeutic implications. apart from some special types of  pla that are comparable in southeast asia and central europe (such as posttraumatic or postprocedural pla), there are clear differences in the microbiological spectrum, which implies different risk factors and disease courses. klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae) pla is predominantly seen in southeast asia, whereas, in central europe, pla is typically caused by escherichia coli, streptococcus or staphylococcus, and these patients are more likely to be older and to have a biliary abnormality or malignancy. k. pneumoniae patients are more likely to have diabetes mellitus. control of septic spread is crucial in k. pneumoniae patients, whereas treatment of the underlying diseases is decisive in many central european pla patients.

TI  == ventilator-associated pneumonia in a tertiary care hospital in india: role of multi-drug resistant pathogens.
AB  == background: ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is the most frequent intensive-care-unit (icu)-acquired infection. the aetiology of vap varies with different patient populations and types of icus. methodology: a prospective study was performed over a period of 15 months in a tertiary care hospital to determine the various aetiological agents causing vap and the prevalence of multidrug resistant (mdr) pathogens. combination disk method, modified hodge test, edta disk synergy (eds) test and ampc disk test were performed for the detection of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl), carbapenemases, metallo-beta-lactamases (mbl) and ampc beta-lactamases respectively. results: enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, candida  spp. were more common in early-onset vap, while non-fermenters (pseudomonas spp.  and acinetobacter spp.) were significantly associated with late-onset vap (p value 0.0267, chi-square value 4.91). thirty-seven (78.7%) of the 47 vap pathogens were multidrug resistant. esbl was produced by 50% and 67% of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae respectively. mbl was produced by 20%  of p. aeruginosa. ampc beta-lactamases were produced by 33.3% and 60.7% of the enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenters respectively. of the s. aureus isolates, 43% were methicillin resistant. prior antibiotic therapy and hospitalization of five days or more were independent risk factors for vap by mdr pathogens. conclusions: vap is increasingly associated with mdr pathogens. production of esbl, ampc beta-lactamases and metallo beta-lactamases were responsible for the multi-drug resistance of these pathogens. increasing prevalence of mdr pathogens  in patients with late-onset vap indicate that appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics should be used to treat them.

TI  == synthesis of 1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-3-cyclopropyl-1h-pyrazol-5-amine derivatives as  antimicrobial agents.
AB  == a series of novel substituted 1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-3-cyclopropyl-1h-pyrazol-5-amine benzamides 9(a-h) were synthesized to determine their antibacterial and antifungal activities as well as possible structure-activity relationships (sars) to improve therapeutic efficacy. the pyrazol-5-amine benzamides were screened for their antibacterial activity against standard strains of gram-positive (streptococcus pyogenes ncim 2608, staphylococcus aureus atcc 29737, bacillus subtilis ncim 2010) and gram-negative  (escherichia coli atcc 25922, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 20852, klebsiella pneumoniae mtcc 618) bacteria by using streptomycin as positive control. they were also tested for their antifungal activities against mycotoxic strains of fusarium verticillioides, aspergillus ochraceous, aspergillus flavus, alternaria  alternata, and penicillium chrysogenum using nystatin as positive control. among  the synthesized compounds, 9d, 9g, and 9h showed potent antimicrobial activities.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline against patient isolates collected during phase  3 clinical trials for diabetic foot infections.
AB  == the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparative antimicrobial agents was evaluated against 1828 primary baseline pathogens isolated from 844 patients enrolled in the phase 3 clinical trials investigating the efficacy of tigecycline in diabetic foot infection (dfi). the trials were global, enrolling patients in 30 countries. tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens in dfi, including gram-positive and gram-negative isolates of both aerobic and anaerobic  bacteria with 95% of mics < or =2 microg/ml for the entire collection. the spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens for dfi, such as staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and bacteroides fragilis. as reported previously, pseudomonas aeruginosa and several pathogens in the proteeae group were generally less susceptible to tigecycline by comparison to other gram-negative pathogens. the excellent in vitro expanded broad-spectrum  activity of tigecycline in the clinical isolates confirmed the potential utility  of tigecycline for pathogens associated with dfis.

TI  == resistance to antibiotics in urinopathogenic bacteria isolated in patients attending kenyatta university health clinic, nairobi.
AB  == objective: to determine the aetiological bacterial agents of urinary tract infections, within communities in kenyatta university, and current resistance levels to commonly available therapeutic agents. design: cross-sectional survey research design. setting: kenyatta university health services clinic, nairobi. subjects: outpatients with symptoms of urinary tract infection within the six months study duration were observed. results: females were particularly prone to  have confirmed cases of uti. escherichia coli were the principle aetiological agent accounting for 61.7% of the isolates. other bacterial agents were enterobacter agglomerans (18.7%), citrobacter diversus (4%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3.3%), proteus spp. (2.1%), pseudomonas spp. (0.1%), staphylococcus saprophyticus (9.3%), and streptococcus feacalis (0.7%). over 60% of the gram negative bacterial isolates were resistant to cotrimoxazole and ampicillin, 39% resistant to augmentin and 25% were resistant to nalidixic acid. the ceftazidime  was the most efficacious antimicrobial with an escherichia coli resistance level  of 2.2% (p=0.05). resistance to nitrofuraintoin, gentamicin, cefuroxime, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin was demonstrated in less than 15% of the bacterial  isolates. conclusion: the cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, nitrofurantoin and gentamicin have good efficacy against the uropathogenic bacteria and may be good  therapeutic choices when culture results are unavailable. high resistance levels  exist against cotrimoxazole, ampicillin, augmentin, and nalidixic acid. these later antibiotics should therefore be used against the uropathogenic bacteria with caution.

TI  == wound healing properties and kill kinetics of clerodendron splendens g. don, a ghanaian wound healing plant.
AB  == as part of our general objective of investigating indigenous plants used in wound healing in ghana, we hereby report our findings from some in vitro and in vivo studies related to wound healing activities of clerodendron splendens g. don (verbanaceae). methanolic extract of the aerial parts of the plant was tested for antimicrobial activity against gram positive bacteria (bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, as well as resistant strains of staph. aureus sa1199b, rn4220 and xu212), gram negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteous mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae) and candida albicans using the micro-well dilution method. survivor-time studies of the microorganisms, radical scavenging activity using 2,2'-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (dpph) and various in vivo wound healing activity studies were also conducted on the extract. the extract exhibited biostatic action against all the test microorganisms with a minimum inhibition concentration (mic) ranging between 64 and 512 mug/ml and a free radical scavenging property with an ic(50) value of 103.2 mug/ml. the results of the in vivo wound healing tests showed that upon application of c. splendens ointment, there was a reduction in the epithelization period from 26.7 days (control) to 13.6 days along with a marked decrease in the scar area from 54.2 mm(2) (control) to 25.2 mm(2). significant increase in the tensile strength and hydroxyproline content were also observed as compared to the control and was comparable to nitrofurazone. the above results appear to justify the traditional use of c. splendens in wound healing and treatment of skin infections in ghana.

TI  == microbiology and epidemiology of brain abscess and subdural empyema in a medical  center: a 10-year experience.
AB  == background and purpose: brain abscess and subdural empyema are the 2 most common  forms of intracranial pyogenic infections. predisposing factors and etiological agents may change with time. this study examined the epidemiological features of  these conditions. methods: the medical records of all inpatients with a diagnosis of brain abscess or subdural empyema from 1998 to 2007 were reviewed. the diagnosis was confirmed by imaging study or operative findings. results: 151 episodes of brain abscess were diagnosed in 150 patients, and 10 patients had subdural empyema. the incidence of brain abscess fluctuated over time, while that of subdural empyema remained stable. the mean +/- standard deviation age of patients with brain abscess was significantly greater than that of patients with  subdural empyema (48.5 +/- 19 years vs 25.4 +/- 24 years; p = 0.004). the number  of patients with hematogenous brain abscess increased from 7 in 1998 to 2002 to 19 in 2003 to 2007, while that of those with infection related to operation decreased from 10 to 5. most subdural empyema was related to bacterial meningitis (4 of 10). etiological agents were identified in 53% of brain abscesses, including enterobacteriaceae spp. (21.3%), streptococcus spp. (20%), and mixed pathogens (17.5%). klebsiella pneumoniae was the most common enteric bacteria isolated (15.3%), especially in patients with diabetes mellitus, but was not observed in children younger than 18 years. conclusions: in contrast to western countries, k. pneumoniae plays an important role in intracranial pyogenic infections in taiwan. the pathogens and routes of infection are different between children and adults.

TI  == [urinary pneumococcal or legionella antigen detection tests and low-spectrum antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia].
AB  == we performed urinary antigen tests for pneumococcus and legionella for patients with community-acquired pneumonia (cap), to prescribe a documented antibiotic therapy. we report the efficiency of low-spectrum antibiotic treatment, illustrating the inappropriateness of bacteriological respiratory sampling. patients and methods: patients with cap were enrolled from three different units; the pneumonia severity index was used to assess the disease. respiratory samples  were also listed. low-spectrum antibiotic therapy was amoxicillin for pneumococcal infection, and macrolides or non-anti-pneumococcal fluoroquinolone for legionellosis. results: six hundred and seventy-five cap were diagnosed during the study period,, 150 with positive urinary antigen tests (23%), among which 108 pneumococcal infections (73%), 40 legionellosis (26%), and two mixed infections. the pneumonia severity index was 106+/-38. amoxicillin was prescribed in 108 cases, fluoroquinolone in 24 cases, macrolide in 18 cases. the outcome was favourable for 138 patients (92%). eighty three respiratory samples allowed identification of a bacterium for 58 patients (39%), among which 24 strains were  not in the antibiotic spectrum: haemophilus influenzae and pseudmomonas aeruginosa in six cases, staphylococcus aureus in five cases, klebsiella pneumoniae in two cases, and another gram negative bacillus in five cases. these  strains were resistant in vitro to the prescribed treatment in 19/24 cases (79%). one out of 12 patients who died had a respiratory sample positive for enterobacter spp strain resistant to the ongoing antibiotic treatment. conclusion: the low-spectrum antibiotic therapy based on urinary antigen tests is efficient, and demonstrates respiratory tract colonisation with bacteriological strains usually considered as pathogenic.

TI  == sialidase-based anti-influenza virus therapy protects against secondary pneumococcal infection.
AB  == background: das181 (fludase) is a sialidase fusion protein in clinical development as a broad-spectrum anti-influenza virus (ifv) therapeutic agent. previous reports by other investigators have raised the concern that desialylation of airway epithelium might increase susceptibility to streptococcus pneumoniae infection. methods: to address whether das181 would lead to an increased risk of pneumococcal infection, we tested s. pneumoniae colonization after das181 treatment of human a549 cells, healthy mice, and mice challenged with a lethal dose of ifv a/pr/8/34 (h1n1) or a/victoria/3/75 (h3n2), followed by 10(4) cfu of s. pneumoniae (d39) on day 3 or day 7. das181 treatment was given 24-48 h after ifv challenge. results: das181 treatment did not increase s. pneumoniae colonization in vitro or in vivo in healthy animals. in ifv-infected mice, das181 prevented pneumonia and significantly prolonged survival and inhibited the ifv titer by > or = 3 logs. none of the treated animals showed enhanced s. pneumoniae colonization of the lung. in addition, opportunistic infections with citrobacter species or klebsiella species occurred only in mice receiving vehicle, not in animals treated with das181. conclusions: these data indicate that das181 treatment does not exacerbate secondary bacterial infection  in mice. das181 may reduce the risk of secondary bacterial infection by inhibiting ifv.

TI  == in vitro activities of doripenem and other carbapenems against clinically important bacteria isolated in intensive care units: nationwide data from the smart programme.
AB  == this nationwide surveillance of clinically important bacteria from the intensive  care units (icus) of major teaching hospitals throughout taiwan investigated the  susceptibilities to doripenem and other comparator carbapenems from september through november 2005. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for 1,311 clinical isolates using the broth microdilution method according to clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) 2005 guidelines. doripenem showed similar (within four-fold difference of mics) in vitro activity to meropenem for enterobacteriaceae and probably comparable activity to meropenem against important nosocomial non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli (nfgnbs), including pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and burkholderia cepacia. among the four carbapenems analysed, doripenem and meropenem exhibited better in vitro activity than imipenem or ertapenem against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli isolates. however, the meropenem mic(90) against esbl-producing k. pneumoniae isolates was 2 microg/ml. besides, doripenem with the mic(90) of 0.5 microg/ml to streptococcus pneumoniae possibly suggested its potential therapeutic effect regarding community-acquired pneumonia. because of the heavy resistance burden in taiwan, closely monitoring the evolutionary trend of carbapenem susceptibilities  against clinically important pathogens is crucial in the future.

TI  == autoimmune diseases: solution of the environmental, immunological and genetic components with principles for immunotherapy and transplantation.
AB  == autoimmune diseases have environmental and genetic components. these are the microbial trigger, the immunity system component and the genetic component. here  we describe these components and how they interact. known microbial triggers are  streptococcus pyogenes for rheumatic carditis, proteus mirabilis for rheumatoid arthritis and klebsiella pneumoniae for ankylosing spondylitis. the immunity system component has been clarified by realisation that no autoimmune disease is  caused by loss of suppressor t cells. this leaves burnet's forbidden clones, clearly seen in graves' disease, as the immunological defect. with wide scope for clonal diversification by somatic gene mutations, to prevent frequent autoimmunity the immunity system is policed by the histocompatibility system. this dictates the immune response repertoire by deleting complementary clones (h  gene theory). we show molecular evidence of how specific histocompatibility antigens can predispose to an autoimmune disease by influencing choice of the microbial antigen to which the immunity system reacts. because of the unlucky random element in the somatic mutations involved in their development, forbidden  clones are unlikely to reappear in new immune repertoires developing after immune ablation and autologous bone marrow cell reconstitution, as observed clinically.  isolation of autoantigens and their attachment to cytotoxic moieties could provide specific immunotherapy for autoimmune diseases. kaplans's discovery that  xenografts can be accepted without rejection after immune ablation followed by autologous and xenogeneic bone marrow inoculation, could enable widespread use of pig grafts for humans.

TI  == streptococcus pneumoniae coinfection is correlated with the severity of h1n1 pandemic influenza.
AB  == background: initial reports in may 2009 of the novel influenza strain h1n1pdm estimated a case fatality rate (cfr) of 0.6%, similar to that of seasonal influenza. in july 2009, however, argentina reported 3056 cases with 137 deaths,  representing a cfr of 4.5%. potential explanations for increased cfr included virus reassortment or genetic drift, or infection of a more vulnerable population. virus genomic sequencing of 26 argentinian samples representing both  severe and mild disease indicated no evidence of reassortment, mutations associated with resistance to antiviral drugs, or genetic drift that might contribute to virulence. furthermore, no evidence was found for increased frequency of risk factors for h1n1pdm disease. methods/principal findings: we examined nasopharyngeal swab samples (nps) from 199 cases of h1n1pdm infection from argentina with masstag pcr, testing for 33 additional microbial agents. the  study population consisted of 199 h1n1pdm-infected subjects sampled between 23 june and 4 july 2009. thirty-nine had severe disease defined as death (n = 20) or hospitalization (n = 19); 160 had mild disease. at least one additional agent of  potential pathogenic importance was identified in 152 samples (76%), including streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 62); haemophilus influenzae (n = 104); human respiratory syncytial virus a (n = 11) and b (n = 1); human rhinovirus a (n = 1)  and b (n = 4); human coronaviruses 229e (n = 1) and oc43 (n = 2); klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2); acinetobacter baumannii (n = 2); serratia marcescens (n = 1); and staphylococcus aureus (n = 35) and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa, n = 6). the presence of s. pneumoniae was strongly correlated with severe disease. s. pneumoniae was present in 56.4% of severe cases versus 25% of mild cases; more than one-third of h1n1pdm nps with s. pneumoniae were from subjects with severe disease (22 of 62 s. pneumoniae-positive nps, p = 0.0004). in subjects 6 to 55 years of age, the adjusted odds ratio (or) of severe disease in the presence of s. pneumoniae was 125.5 (95% confidence interval [ci], 16.95, 928.72; p<0.0001).  conclusions/significance: the association of s. pneumoniae with morbidity and mortality is established in the current and previous influenza pandemics. however, this study is the first to demonstrate the prognostic significance of non-invasive antemortem diagnosis of s. pneumoniae infection and may provide insights into clinical management.

TI  == microbial aetiologic agents associated with pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts.
AB  == pulmonary infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunosuppressed patients. the aim of this study was to determine the etiologic agents and predisposing factors associated with pneumonia infections in immunocompromised patients. cross-sectional survey of 100 immunocompromised patients due to hiv and mycobacterium tuberculosis infections were enlisted for the study. the patients completed a structured questionnaire to abstract information on demographic features and risk factors. sputum samples were collected from the patients with clinical suspicion of having pneumonia and the sputa examined by cultural methods. the tuberculosis patients had the highest number of isolates, 119 (70%) while those with co-infections of hiv/aids and tuberculosis had 41(24.1%) and those with only hiv infection were 10 (5.9%). the  distribution of isolates were as follows, staphylococcus aureus 63 (37.9%), streptococcus pyogenes 44 (25.9%), streptococcus pneumoniae 27 (15.9%), candida albicans 24 (14.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae 7 (4.1%), proteus mirabilis 4 (2.4%) and escherichia coli 1 (0.5%). those with previous history of alcoholism and tobacco smoking had relatively high isolates. this study demonstrated that secondary infections are prevalent in the immunocompromised patients due to hiv/aids and tb or co-infection with tb/hiv-aids. this may lead to drug resistance, dots or haart programme, thereby leading to high mortality and morbidity.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from more than 10,000 patients with infectious respiratory diseases: a 25-year longitudinal study.
AB  == the study group on antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from respiratory infections was established in 1981 in japan to elucidate trends in such susceptibilities in patients with infectious respiratory diseases; the group has conducted nationwide research in collaboration with 21 medical institutions.  examination of more than 10,000 patients by 2005 allowed a summary of study findings. streptococcus pneumoniae started to become resistant to penicillin g in the 1990s, and the isolation rate of penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp + prsp) reached almost 60% in 2001. the  proportion of prsp also increased, reaching 19.4%. thereafter, the rate of pisp + prsp decreased somewhat to the mid-30% range. macrolide resistance was also observed; in 2005, the prevalence of strains highly susceptible to erythromycin with mics <or= 0.06 microg/ml had decreased to 15.5%, whereas the proportion of highly resistant strains with mics >or= 128 microg/ml exceeded 40%. among staphylococcus aureus isolates, the proportion of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) strains began to increase rapidly in 1986 and constituted around 60% of all s. aureus strains identified in 1990 and in the following years. in 1993, the prevalence of ampicillin-resistant isolates of haemophilus influenzae had increased remarkably, presumably related to the outbreak of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (blnar) h. influenzae strains, and the proportion of these strains among the isolates surpassed 30% in 2002 and thereafter. for klebsiella pneumoniae, the antimicrobial activity of first- to fourth-generation cephems improved with each generation. the mic distribution patterns of pseudomonas aeruginosa shifted towards higher mics when compared with the mics for other pathogens. broad patterns with no distinct peaks reflected the difficulty in treating p. aeruginosa infection. regarding moraxella catarrhalis,  beta-lactamase-producing strains already constituted a majority of the isolates in 1990, and the proportion of strains highly susceptible to ampicillin, with mics <or= 0.06 microg/ml, was less than 10% at that time.

TI  == [analysis on the sensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics of respiratory-infectious isolates on the second survey on the sensitivity of isolates conducted by the japanese society of chemotherapy in 2007--concerning the aspect of pk/pd break points].
AB  == sensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics of isolates clinically obtained from respiratory infection sites in adults on the second survey on sensitivity of isolates conducted by the japanese society of chemotherapy in 2007 was investigated according to the classification of the "guideline for treatment for  adult nosocomial pneumonia in 2008". among the primary antibacterial drugs for mild (a) and moderate (b) nosocomial pneumonia in adults, beta-lactam antibiotics; ceftriaxone (ctrx), sulbactam/ampicillin (sbt/abpc), panipenem/betamipron (papm/bp), tazobactam/piperacillin (taz/pipc), imipenem/cilastatin (ipm/cs), meropenem (mepm), doripenem (drpm), biapenem (bipm) were studied to evaluate their clinical efficacy. the covering rate was analyzed  using the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and break point of pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (pk/pd). consequently, the results with methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and klebsiella pneumoniae revealed  the mic90 of all antibacterial drugs to be at low levels, while almost 100% of isolates were within the range of pk/pd break points except bipm and sbt/abpc to  h. influenzae, and sbt/abpc to k. pneumoniae. however, the analysis of p. aeruginosa didn't reach 100% for the covering rates of isolates, indicating that  these drugs did not have a complete inhibitory action to restrict bacterial proliferation. the analysis of all 5 carbapenem drugs showed superiority to taz/pipc in mic90 while covering rates of isolates at pk/pd break points showed inferiority to taz/pipc. this tendency was found to be more significant in covering the rates of isolates on the regular dose with maximal bactericidal action and on the maximum dose. this is because the maximum dose approved in japan is as low as half that in ipm/cs and 1/3 that in mepm in western countries.

AB  == mics to tigecycline and 12 antimicrobials were performed by microdilution method, against 2423 nonduplicate pathogens recently isolated in 17 greek hospitals. the  food and drug administration (fda) and european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) criteria were used comparatively for interpretation of tigecycline mics. tigecycline exhibited potent in vitro activity against the majority of the isolates tested. (mic(90) values of 0.5, 1,  2, 0.125, 1, 0.25, 0.125, and 1 mg/l were observed for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., moraxella catarrhalis, acinetobacter spp., staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus spp., and streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, respectively.) tigecycline activity was the same, irrespective of the resistance profile to other antimicrobials (gram-negative pathogens susceptible or resistant to imipenem, enterococcus spp., s. aureus, or s. pneumoniae isolates, susceptible or resistant to vancomycin, methicillin or penicillin, respectively). interpretation using eucast and fda breakpoints differed among isolates of k. pneumoniae and enterobacter spp. having tigecycline mics of 2 to 4 mg/l. in conclusion, tigecycline exhibited potent activity against pathogens recently isolated in a region that experiences high antimicrobial resistance rates. indications that the available criteria might categorize differently tigecycline susceptibility status in k. pneumoniae and enterobacter spp. isolates were also detected.

TI  == summary trends for the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection program: a 10-year experience in the united states (1999-2008).
AB  == the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) program  was a global, longitudinal antimicrobial resistance surveillance network of more  than 100 medical centers worldwide monitoring the susceptibility of meropenem and selected other broad-spectrum comparator agents. in 1999, and from 2000 through 2008, a total of 10 or 15 united states (usa) medical centers each forwarded 200  nonduplicate clinical isolates from serious infections to a central processing laboratory. over the 10-year period of this surveillance program, the activity of meropenem and an average of 11 other antimicrobial agents were assessed against a total of 27 289 bacterial isolates using clinical and laboratory standards institute reference methods. meropenem consistently demonstrated low resistance rates against enterobacteriaceae species isolates through 2008 and did not exhibit a widespread change in resistance rates over the monitored interval. in fact, the incidence of emerging carbapenemase-producing (kpc-type) klebsiella spp. showed a decline in 2008 compared to the steeply increasing rates observed from 2004 to 2007. moreover, the kpc serine carbapenemases have spread to other enterobacteriaceae species monitored by the mystic program. greatest increases in antimicrobial resistance rates were observed for the fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin) among all species monitored by the mystic program.  current susceptibility rates for meropenem when tested against prevalent pathogens were pseudomonas aeruginosa (439 strains, 85.4% susceptible), enterobacteriaceae (1537 strains, 97.3% susceptible), methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (460 strains, 100.0% susceptible), streptococcus pneumoniae (125 strains, 80.2% at meningitis susceptibility breakpoints), other streptococci (159 strains, 90.0-100.0% susceptible), and acinetobacter spp. (127 strains, 45.7% susceptible), the widest spectrum among beta-lactams tested in 2008 and throughout the last decade. continued local surveillance of broad-spectrum agents following the completion of the mystic program (usa) appears critical to detect emerging resistances among pathogens causing the most serious infections requiring carbapenem agents.

TI  == bacteriology of external ocular infections in aba, south eastern nigeria.
AB  == background: bacteria are microbial agents that frequently cause infections of the eye and possible loss of vision. method: the common isolates were studied in 298  bacterial infections of the anterior eye, consisting of 35 blepharitis, 208 conjunctivitis and 55 keratitis. isolates were cultured in blood agar and chocolate agar. each strain's susceptibility to the antibiotics was determined using a standard table of antibiotic susceptibility. results: in decreasing order of frequency, the implicated bacteria were staphylococcus aureus 80 (23.7 per cent), staphylococcus albus 65 (19.2 per cent), pseudomonas aeruginosa 34 (10.1 per cent), streptococcus pneumoniae 29 (8.6 per cent), haemophilus influenzae 26  (7.7 per cent), streptococcus pyogene 20 (6.2 per cent), klebsiella pneumoniae 18 (6.2 per cent), escherichia coli 15 (4.4 per cent), neisseria gonorrhoeae 13 (3.9 per cent), streptococcus viridans 11 (3.5 per cent), moraxella catarrhalis 10 (3.0 per cent), streptococcus faecalis 5 (1.5 per cent), proteus mirabilis 5 (1.5 per cent) and neisseria meningitides 1 (0.3 per cent). bacteria were isolated most frequently from infections of the conjunctiva (222, 66.7 per cent), then the cornea (65, 20.1 per cent) and least from the eyelids (44, 13.2 per cent). bacterial isolates varied in their clinical features (p < 0.01). the age distribution showed isolations of 77 (23.2 per cent) and 79 (23.7 per cent) in the age groups of newborn to under three years and three to under 12 years, respectively. this was comparable to 66 (19.8 per cent) for the 12 to under 18 years, 61 (18.3 per cent) for the 18 to under 40 years age group and 50 (15 per cent) for those 40 years and above. bacterial isolates had no predilection for the age of patients (p < 0.95). conjunctivitis was diagnosed more in children, 60 (28.8 per cent) in the newborn to under three years and 53 (25.5 per cent) in the three to under 12 years age groups. blepharitis was diagnosed most frequently (15, 42.8 per cent) in adolescents 12 to under 18 years, while keratitis was more in adults (20, 36.4 per cent) in the 18 to under 40 years and (15, 27.3 per cent) in the 40 years and above. diagnosis varied among age groups but there was no relationship between sex and diagnosis (p < 0.75). klebsiella pneumoniae was the  most resistant to all the anti-bacterial preparations. the bacterial isolates were more susceptible to the second generation quinolones than the first. conclusion: the study recommends that quinolones be available as ophthalmic preparations to be prescribed by the qualified practitioners to avoid development of resistance from indiscriminate use.

TI  == pneumonia in severely malnourished children in developing countries - mortality risk, aetiology and validity of who clinical signs: a systematic review.
AB  == objectives: to quantify the degree by which moderate and severe degrees of malnutrition increase the mortality risk in pneumonia, to identify potential differences in the aetiology of pneumonia between children with and without severe malnutrition, and to evaluate the validity of who-recommended clinical signs (age-specific fast breathing and chest wall indrawing) for the diagnosis of pneumonia in severely malnourished children. methods: systematic search of the existing literature using a variety of databases (medline, embase, the web of science, scopus and cinahl). results: mortality risk: sixteen relevant studies were identified, which universally showed that children with pneumonia and moderate or severe malnutrition are at higher risk of death. for severe malnutrition, reported relative risks ranged from 2.9 to 121.2; odds ratios ranged from 2.5 to 15.1. for moderate malnutrition, relative risks ranged from 1.2 to 36.5. aetiology: eleven studies evaluated the aetiology of pneumonia in severely malnourished children. commonly isolated bacterial pathogens were klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and haemophilus influenzae. the spectrum and frequency of organisms differed from those reported in children without severe malnutrition. there are very few data on the role of respiratory viruses and tuberculosis. clinical signs: four studies investigating the validity of clinical signs showed  that who-recommended clinical signs were less sensitive as predictors of radiographic pneumonia in severely malnourished children. conclusions: pneumonia  and malnutrition are two of the biggest killers in childhood. guidelines for the  care of children with pneumonia and malnutrition need to take into account this strong and often lethal association if they are to contribute to the un millennium development goal 4, aiming for substantial reductions in childhood mortality. additional data regarding the optimal diagnostic approach to and management of pneumonia and malnutrition are required from regions where death from these two diseases is common.

TI  == description of streptococcus pneumoniae infections in burn patients.
AB  == background: longer survival in burn patients has resulted in more infectious complications, typically with klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and staphylococcus aureus. although streptococcus pneumoniae infections are common in the community and can cause nosocomial infections, the incidence and risk factors for pneumococcal infections in burn patients is unclear. methods: we performed an electronic retrospective chart review to collect rates of and risk factors for s. pneumoniae infections in patients with thermal burns from march 2003 through june 2008. results: of the 1838 patients admitted to the burn center, 10 were infected (0.54% incidence). patients presented with pneumonia (seven patients, 0.38% incidence) and bacteremia (three patients, 0.16% incidence) within a week of initial burn (median 1 day, range 0-8), often in the setting of bacterial co-infection (five patients). this group was mainly young males with median 28.8% total body surface area burns; 60% had concomitant inhalational injury. most did not have traditional risk factors for pneumococcal infection but had objective signs of infection at time of positive culture and were treated with appropriate antibiotics. two patients in this series died, although no mortality was attributed to s. pneumoniae. conclusions: pneumococcal disease is not common in burn patients and generally occurs early on in hospitalization after burn making  it more likely to be a community-acquired pathogen rather than nosocomial in the  burn population. it should be considered in the setting of sepsis or new pulmonary infiltrates within a week after burn, but typical empiric antibiotics against the usual burn pathogens should be adequate to also treat for pneumococcal infection.

TI  == the clinical consequences of antimicrobial resistance.
AB  == the continued evolution of antimicrobial resistance in the hospital and more recently in the community threatens to seriously compromise our ability to treat  serious infections. the major success of the seven-valent streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine at reducing both infection and resistance has been followed by the emergence of previously minor serotypes that express multiresistance. the almost universal activity of cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones against community escherichia coli strains has been compromised by the spread of ctx-m beta-lactamase-producing, fluoroquinolone-resistant strains, and the emergence of community-onset methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, particularly in the  united states, has forced us to re-think our empirical treatment guidelines for skin and soft-tissue infections. finally, our most potent and reliable class of antibiotics, the carbapenems, is compromised by the growth, primarily in intensive care units, of multiresistant klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumanni, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the lack of a robust pipeline of new agents, particularly against resistant gram-negative bacteria, emphasizes the importance of optimizing our use of current antimicrobials and promoting strict adherence to established infection control practices.

TI  == dark secrets behind the shimmer of contact lens: the indian scenario.
AB  == background: we studied the bacteriological profile of soft contact lens and its accessories among the asymptomatic subjects and monitored the compliance level with the lens use and its cleaning protocol. findings: a total of 115 (104 daily  wear and 11 extended wear) subjects using contact lens were studied. data regarding the duration of use and frequency and method of cleaning were recorded. contact lens, lens cases, preserving solutions and tips of solution bottles were  the samples collected. the isolates were identified on the basis of their phenotypic characters. samples from 24 subjects (21 daily wear and 3 extended wear) were found contaminated. of the 24 contaminated cases, 23 showed medium adherence to the cleaning protocol. contamination rate was higher among the 56 daily wear lens users who used same lens for 2 years and more, than the 48 users  who used their lenses for less than 2 years. lens case contamination was found in all the 24 cases. the bacteria isolated were citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pneumoniae. in extended wear lens users, there was no change in microbial flora on repeating the cultures on day 7 and 14. conclusion: non-compliance with contact lens use may lead to invitation of microbial flora. the accumulation of these bacteria may act as a precursor to biofilm formation, thus colonizing the lens accessories as well. the bacteria isolated in this study were similar to the ones causing microbial keratitis thus, predisposing the otherwise asymptomatic subjects to permanent visual damage.

TI  == comparison of clinical symptoms scored according to the national institutes of health chronic prostatitis symptoms index and assessment of antimicrobial treatment in patients with chronic prostatitis syndrome.
AB  == we examined a total of 194 patients over 18 years of age with chronic prostatitis syndrome and no evidence of structural or functional lower genitourinary tract abnormalities. the following data were obtained for each patient: clinical history--the severity of chronic prostatitis symptoms scored by a croatian translation of the nih cpsi questionnaire, clinical status including digitorectal examination, urethral swab specimens, and selective samples of urine and expressed prostatic secretion, according to the 4-glass localization test (meares and stamey localization technique). patients were treated orally with antimicrobial agents in doses and duration according to clinical practice in croatia. an infectious etiology was determined in 169 (87%) patients. chlamydia trachomatis was the causative pathogen in 38 (20%), trichomonas vaginalis in 35 (18%), enterococcus in 36 (19%) and escherichia coli in 35 (18%) patients. in the remaining 25 patients the following causative pathogens were found: ureaplasma urealyticum, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. comparison of symptoms scores and effect on quality of life has shown that the most severe clinical presentation of disease was recorded in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by e. coli and enterococcus (p<0.001). clinical success was paralleled by bacteriological eradication in chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by c. trachomatis, enterococcus and e. coli (kappa >0.2<0.5), but not in inflammatory chronic pelvic pain syndrome caused by t. vaginalis.

TI  == [predisposing factors of community acquired bacterial meningitis (excluding neonates)].
AB  == meningeal defects and primitive ent infections are known to promote pneumococcal  meningitis. other risk factors can be identified in the occurrence of community acquired bacterial meningitis (cabm) and play a key role either in the frequency  of this kind of infection, the type of bacteria concerned, the prognosis or the risk of recurrence. thus, epidural infiltrations are rarely responsible for staphylococcal or streptococcal meningitis. cochlear implants are also known to increase the risk of pneumococcal meningitis. the occurrence in children of aseptic meningitis or meningitis due to staphylococcus aureus or enterobacteriaceae is strongly suggestive of congenital spinal or cerebral anomalies (dermal sinus or spina bifida). mri must be rapidly performed. in cases of splenectomy or asplenism, pneumococcal meningitis is common and must be prevented. according to the larger series available on this topic, age over 60, diabetes mellitus, alcoholism and immune deficiency are found to promote cabm in  about 25% of cases. streptococcus pneumoniae is the most frequent causative bacteria in elderly patients, in case of alcoholism, as well as listeria monocytogenes and some enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae). l. monocytogenes is frequently isolated in immunodepressed patients  and patients treated by anti-tnf molecules (infliximab notably). finally, some genetic polyphormisms promote cabm: complement and properdin deficiencies (meningococcal meningitis), mannose-binding lectin deficiency, fcgamma receptors  alteration or interleukin-1 and il-1r polymorphisms. screening for such genetic disorders may be discussed in case of cabm but is mandatory in case of recurrent  meningococcal infections.

TI  == increase in detectable opportunistic bacteria in the oral cavity of orthodontic patients.
AB  == objectives: this study was performed to detect the opportunistic bacteria and fungi from the oral cavities of orthodontic patients and examine the ability of the organisms to adhere to saliva-coated metallic brackets. methods: opportunistic bacteria and fungi were isolated from 58 patients (orthodontic group: 42; non-orthodontic group: 16) using culture methods and were identified based on their biochemical and enzymatic profiles. seven opportunistic and four streptococcal strains were tested for their ability to adhere to saliva-coated metallic brackets. results: more opportunistic bacteria and fungi were detected in the orthodontic group than in the non-orthodontic group (p < 0.05). opportunistic bacteria adhered to saliva-coated metallic brackets to the same degree as oral streptococci. conclusions: the isolation frequencies of opportunistic bacteria and fungi increase during orthodontic treatment, suggesting the importance of paying special attention to oral hygiene in orthodontic patients to prevent periodontal disease and the aggravation of systemic disease in immunocompromised conditions.

TI  == early- and late-onset pneumonia: is this still a useful classification?
AB  == the choice of empirical treatment of nosocomial pneumonia in the intensive-care unit (icu) used to rely on the interval after the start of mechanical ventilation. nowadays, however, the question of whether in fact there is a difference in the distribution of causative pathogens is under debate. data from  308 icus from the german national nosocomial infection surveillance system, including information on relevant pathogens isolated in 11,285 cases of nosocomial pneumonia from 1997 to 2004, were used for our evaluation. each individual pneumonia case was allocated either to early- or to late-onset pneumonia, with three differentiation criteria: onset on the 4th day, the 5th day, or the 7th day in the icu. the frequency of pathogens was evaluated according to these categories. a total of 5,066 additional cases of pneumonia were reported from 2005 to 2006, after the cdc criteria had been modified. from 1997 to 2004, the most frequent microorganisms were staphylococcus aureus (2,718  cases, including 720 with methicillin [meticillin]-resistant s. aureus), followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa (1,837 cases), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,305 cases), escherichia coli (1,137 cases), enterobacter spp. (937 cases), streptococci (671  cases), haemophilus influenzae (509 cases), acinetobacter spp. (493 cases), and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (308 cases). the order of the four most frequent pathogens (accounting for 53.7% of all pathogens) was the same in both groups and was independent of the cutoff categories applied: s. aureus was first, followed by p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. coli. thus, the predictabilities of the occurrence of pathogens were similar for the earlier (1997-to-2004) and later (2005-to-2006) time frames. this classification is no longer helpful for empirical antibiotic therapy, since the pathogens are the same for both groups.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of tigecycline and comparators against bacterial isolates collected as part of the test study in europe (2004-2007).
AB  == tigecycline is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent that has been approved for the treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections as well as intra-abdominal infections. the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test) is a global, longitudinal surveillance study established in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against key gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. this report examines data obtained for 24748 isolates collected across 24 european countries between 2004 and 2007. tigecycline, meropenem and imipenem were the most active antimicrobial agents against most gram-negative isolates including multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii (15.7% of the a. baumannii isolates in this study), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli (8.5% of e. coli) and esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae (13.6% of k. pneumoniae). only amikacin was  active against >90% of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (92.8% susceptible). tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin were the most active agents against gram-positive agents across europe between 2004 and 2007, with tigecycline displaying the lowest mic(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms) against meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (26.5% of the collected s. aureus isolates), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (15.7% of the e. faecium strains) and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (9.3% of the s. pneumoniae strains). longitudinal analysis showed no increase in  tigecycline mic values over the 4-year study period, whilst increased resistance  was noted for several comparator agents.

TI  == growth inhibition of foodborne and pathogenic bacteria by conjugated linoleic acid.
AB  == the influence of conjugated linoleic acid (cla) on the growth of some foodborne and pathogenic bacteria was examined. a potassium salt of cla (cla-k) was tested  against three gram-positive strains ( bacillus cereus , staphylococcus aureus , and streptococcus mutans ) and five gram-negative strains ( pseudomonas aeruginosa , salmonella typhimurium , vibrio parahemolyticus , klebsiella pneumoniae , and proteus mirabilis ). cla-k-mediated growth inhibition was evident for all tested strains, particularly the gram-positive strains. the ic(50) value of cla-k was 0.3 mm for b. cereus, 1.2 mm for s. aureus, and 0.3 mm  for s. mutans, whereas the value was 1.2 mm for k. pneumoniae, 1.2 mm for p. aeruginosa, 1.8 mm for s. typhimurium, 1.8 mm for v. parahemolyticus, and 2.4 mm  for p. mirabilis. the cla-k delayed the growth of all the tested strains at lower cla-k concentrations, but completely inhibited the growth at higher concentrations. all cells grown in the medium containing cla-k contained cla in their membranes and exhibited irregular cell surface and cell disruption, which were greater in gram-positive than gram-negative strains. higher lactic dehydrogenase activity (ldh), protein content, and malondialdehyde (mda) content  were evident in gram-positive strains than in gram-negative strains. these results suggest that the broad spectrum of growth inhibition by cla mediated through the lipid peroxidation of cla in the membranes and in the medium.

TI  == community-acquired bacterial meningitis in elderly patients: experience over 30 years.
AB  == clinical characteristics, etiologies, evolution, and prognostic factors of community-acquired bacterial meningitis in elderly patients are not well known. to improve this knowledge, all episodes of community-acquired bacterial meningitis were prospectively recorded and cases occurring in patients >or=65 years old were selected. during the period 1977-2006, 675 episodes in adults (aged >or=18 yr) were recorded, with 185 (27%) in patients aged >or=65 years old; 76 were male and 109 were female, with a mean age of 73 +/- 6 years (range, 65-93 yr). causative microorganisms were streptococcus pneumoniae 74, neisseria meningitidis 49, listeria monocytogenes 17, other streptococcal 9, escherichia coli 6, haemophilus influenzae 4, klebsiella pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus 2 each, capnocytophaga canimorsus and enterococcus faecalis 1 each, and unknown in 20. on admission 91% had had fever, 32% were in a coma (glasgow coma scale <or=8), 9% presented with seizures, and 8% with shock. thirty patients (16%) presented with seizures during therapy. mortality was 58/185 (31%). compared with patients aged 18-65 years, there were significant differences among older patients (aged >or=65 yr), who showed a higher frequency of diabetes and malignancy as underlying disease; pneumonia, otitis, and pericranial fistula as predisposing factors; and s. pneumoniae and l. monocytogenes as etiology. there were also differences in clinical presentation, complications, sequelae, and mortality. factors independently related with mortality were age, pneumonia as a  predisposing factor, coma on admission, and heart failure and seizures after therapy. dexamethasone therapy was a protective factor. in conclusion, bacterial  meningitis in elderly patients is associated with greater diagnostic difficulties and neurologic severity and more complications, as well as with increased mortality. antiseizure prophylaxis might be useful in these patients.

AB  == tigecycline has been investigated in combination with other antibacterials against a wide range of susceptible and multiresistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. combinations have been analysed in vitro, in animal models and in human case reports. in vitro, tigecycline combined with other antimicrobials produces primarily an indifferent response (neither synergy nor antagonism). nevertheless, synergy occurred when tigecycline was combined with rifampicin against 64-100% of enterococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacter spp. and brucella melitensis isolates. combinations of tigecycline with amikacin also showed synergy for 40-100% of enterobacter spp., klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp. and stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates. moreover, bactericidal synergisms occurred with tigecycline plus amikacin against problematic acinetobacter baumannii and proteus vulgaris, and with colistin against k. pneumoniae. data from animal experiments and case reports, although limited, displayed consistent beneficial activity of tigecycline in combination with other antibacterials against multiresistant organisms, including vancomycin  against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae in experimental meningitis, gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa in experimental pneumonia, daptomycin against enterococcus faecium endocarditis, and colistin against k. pneumoniae bacteraemia and p. aeruginosa osteomyelitis. antagonism was extremely rare in vitro and was not reported in vivo. thus, tigecycline may be combined with a second antimicrobial as part of a combination regimen.

TI  == antimicrobial property of a herbal preparation containing dalbergia sissoo and datura tramonium with cow urine against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == in this study, a herbal preparation containing dalbergia sissoo and datura stramoium with cow urine (dsds), was evaluated for its antibacterial potential against pathogenic strains of gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae) and gram-negative (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria. antibacterial activity was compared to standard antibiotic drugs i.e. chloramphenicol (30 mcg), ampicillin (10 mcg), nalidixic acid (10 mcg) and rifampicin (30 mcg). cow urine extract was  found to be most active against both gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria. clinical isolate of s. aureus showed higher sensitivity towards cow urine extract of dsds than standard strains, and inhibited growth on most regulatory levels such as inhibition of protein, dna, rna and peptidoglycan synthesis. the results of the present study shows that the cow urine extract of dsds may be used as a potent antiseptic preparation for prevention and treatment  of chronic bacterial infections.

TI  == pathogens associated with sepsis in newborns and young infants in developing countries.
AB  == introduction: knowledge of pathogens causing infections in young infants (up to 90 days of life) is essential for devising community-based management strategies. most etiological data from developing countries are hospital-based and may have little relevance to communities in which most babies are born at home. methods: we searched the literature for studies from developing countries reporting etiology of community-acquired infections (sepsis, pneumonia, meningitis) published since 1980. hospital-based studies reporting early onset sepsis, sepsis among babies admitted from, or born at home were included. results: of 63 studies, 13 focused on community-acquired infections, but limited data were available from home-born neonates. in the first week of life (3209 isolates), klebsiella species (25%), escherichia coli (15%), and staphylococcus aureus (18%) were major pathogens. group b streptococci (gbs) were relatively uncommon (7%), although regional differences existed. after the first week of life (835 isolates), s. aureus (14%), gbs (12%), streptococcus pneumoniae (12%), and nontyphoidal salmonella species (13%) were most frequent. s. pneumoniae (27%) was most common in the postneonatal period (among 141 isolates). gram-negatives predominated (77%) among home-delivered babies (among 170 isolates). conclusions: limited information is available on etiology of serious bacterial infections in community settings. hospital-based studies suggest that most infections in the first week of life are due to gram-negative pathogens, and many may be environmentally rather than maternally-acquired, owing to unhygienic delivery practices. such practices may also explain the predominance of gram-negative infections among home-born infants, although data from home settings are limited. these findings have implications for developing prevention and management strategies in communities and hospitals.

TI  == update on antimicrobial susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms in the united states: results from the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test) 2005 to 2007.
AB  == background: the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (ttest) is a global surveillance study initiated in 2004.its goal is to assess the in vitro activity  of the glycylcycline, tigecycline, and comparator antimicrobials. objective: the  aim of this study was to measure the in vitro activity of a panel of antimicrobial agents against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms collected  in the united states in 2005, 2006, and 2007. methods: isolates were collected from 172 centers across the united states.in vitro activity was assessed using clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guidelines and clsi or us food and drug administration interpretive criteria. results: overall, data on 20,897 gram-negative and 8949 gram-positive isolates were collected. for the majority of organisms, percentage susceptibilities were unchanged over the 3 years of collection. one exception was acinetobacter baumannii; rates of susceptibility to the majority of agents in the panel decreased by approximately 10% over the 3 years. rates of resistant phenotypes were relatively unchanged with mean percentages over the 3 years of: 8.9% (337/3787) for extended beta-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing klebsiella pneumoniae; 2.1% (17/801) for esbl-producing klebsiella oxytoca; 2.3% (111/4861) for esbl-pproducing escherichia coli; 56.2% (2564/4560) for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus; 5.1% (97/1903) for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis; and 67.2%  (487/725) for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. the minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (mic(90)) for tigecycline was stable over the 3 years and was < or = 22 mg/l against non-esbl-producing k pneumoniae, k oxytoca, e coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and a baumannii. against methicillin susceptible and -resistant s aureus, e faecalis, e faecium, and streptococcus agalactiae tigecycline mic(90)s were < or = 0.25 mg/l. conclusions: this report of 3 years of data from the test study suggests stable susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, with the exception of decreased susceptibility rates for a baumannii. tigecycline continued to have good activity against enterobacteriaceae, a baumannii, s aureus, e faecalis, e faecium, and s agalactiae.

TI  == [bacterial etiology of pneumonia in hospitalized children: combined detection with culture and polymerase chain reaction].
AB  == objective: bacterial cultures from respiratory aspirate or sputum have been the conventional diagnostic method for pneumonia, but the results of culture was often affected by early extensive use of antibiotics, sample collection and delivery. the objective of this study was to explore application of the combined  detection of culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay in hospitalized children with pneumonia. methods: totally 187 hospitalized children with pneumonia were enrolled. the age of the patients ranged from 1 month to 10 years, 124 were male, 63 female; 175 of the patients received antibiotics treatment before admission. deep respiratory aspirate sample from patients was cultured by  streptococcus pneumoniae selective plate, hemophilus influenzae selective plate and conventional plate. the aspirate samples were also amplified for dna of 14 bacteria with target enriched multiplex polymerase chain reaction (tem-pcr) and detected with luminex xmap technology platform. results: the total positive rate  by bacterial culture was 40.1% (75/187), of which 17.1% (24/187) were hemophilus  influenzae b, 8.6% (16/187) were escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were klebsiella  pneumoniae, 4.8% (9/187) were staphylococcus aureus, 3.7% (7/187) were streptococcus pneumoniae, 1.6% (3/187) were pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1.1% (2/187)  were acinetobacter baumannii, and 1.1% (2/187) were enterobacter cloacae. the total positive rate by combined detection of culture and tem-pcr assay were 78.6% (147/187), of which 28.9% (54/187) were hemophilus influenzae b, 19.3% (36/187) were streptococcus pneumoniae, 8.6% (16/187) were escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were klebsiella pneumoniae, 5.9% (11/187) were staphylococcus aureus, 5.9% (11/187) were acinetobacter baumannii, 2.7% (5/187) were pseudomonas aeruginosa,  and 1.1% (2/187) were enterobacter cloacae. conclusion: the tem-pcr assay may increase the detection rate of hemophilus influenzae b, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. the combined detection may increase the positive rate of bacterial pathogens in hospitalized children with pneumonia, and the results might reflect the real patterns of bacterial etiology. the tem-pcr needs further improvement for diagnosis of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae.

TI  == [comparative analysis of the pathogens responsible for hospital acquired and community acquired late onset neonatal septicemia].
AB  == objective: late onset neonatal septicemia (systemic infection after 72 hours of life) remains a major cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. early treatment  with appropriate antibiotics is critical since infected infants can deteriorate rapidly. the aim of this study was to review the pathogens responsible for late onset neonatal septicemia (lons) and their antimicrobial susceptibilities in order to guide the initial selection of appropriate antibiotics for infants with  suspected lons. methods: a retrospective chart review of all cases with lons seen in the neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) of yuying children's hospital of wenzhou medical college from january 1, 2002 to december 31, 2005 was conducted.  all cases were selected based on the clinical presentation and at least one positive result of blood culture. the basic clinical characteristics and the results of blood culture and antimicrobial susceptibilities were analyzed. results: a total of 102 cases with lons were identified. among those 102 cases, 80 were community acquired (infants admitted from home and the blood culture was  done on admission) and 22 were hospital acquired (infants became sick while in the nicu and the blood culture was done prior to use of antibiotics). the clinical presentations were non-specific. compared to the infants with community  acquired lons, infants with hospital acquired lons were usually born more prematurely (mean gestational age 33 +/- 3 vs 39 +/- 2 wks, t = 2.255, p < 0.01), with lower weight (mean weight 1.79 +/- 0.70 vs 3.23 +/- 0.67 kg, t = 8.818, p <  0.01) and with younger age (mean age 12 +/- 6 vs 16 +/- 7 days, t = 7.581, p < 0.05). of the 102 cases, a total of 103 strains of bacteria were isolated. among  the pathogenic bacteria isolated, the most common were coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cons) (50/103, 48.5%), followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (16/103, 15.5%). the main pathogens for community acquired lons were staphylococcus species and escherichia coli. the most important pathogen responsible for hospital acquired lons was klebsiella pneumoniae. most (> 80%) of the staphylococcus especially cons were resistant to common antibiotics such as penicillin, erythromycin and cefazolin. significant numbers (6/9) of staphylococcus aureus isolated were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). however, all of the staphyloccus isolates were sensitive to vancomycin. almost all (15/16) of the klebsiella pneumoniae isolated were multi-drug resistant due to production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls). they were sensitive only to a few antibiotics such as carbapenems, aminoglycosides and quinolones. there was also one strain of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre). furthermore, there was no a single case of late onset neonatal sepsis due to infection with group b streptococcus (gbs). conclusions: the clinical manifestations of late onset neonatal sepsis are usually non-specific. gbs is not a significant pathogen responsible for community acquired lons in the wenzhou area. there are increasing numbers of multi-drug resistant bacterial species isolated from the newborn infants with late onset neonatal septicemia, which is most likely due the non-restricted use of antibiotics in the hospitals as well as in the communities. a routine blood culture should be taken from any newborn infant who is suspected of lons and empirical use of appropriate antibiotics should be initiated as soon as the blood specimen for culture has been drawn. to  reduce the occurrence of multi-drug resistant bacteria, the use of antibiotics especially the third generation cephalosporins in neonates should be restricted as much as possible.

TI  == a fatty acid messenger is responsible for inducing dispersion in microbial biofilms.
AB  == it is well established that in nature, bacteria are found primarily as residents  of surface-associated communities called biofilms. these structures form in a sequential process initiated by attachment of cells to a surface, followed by the formation of matrix-enmeshed microcolonies, and culminating in dispersion of the  bacteria from the mature biofilm. in the present study, we have demonstrated that, during growth, pseudomonas aeruginosa produces an organic compound we have  identified as cis-2-decenoic acid, which is capable of inducing the dispersion of established biofilms and of inhibiting biofilm development. when added exogenously to p. aeruginosa pao1 biofilms at a native concentration of 2.5 nm, cis-2-decenoic acid was shown to induce the dispersion of biofilm microcolonies.  this molecule was also shown to induce dispersion of biofilms, formed by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and the yeast candida albicans. active at nanomolar concentrations, cis-2-decenoic acid appears to be functionally and structurally related to the class of short-chain fatty acid signaling molecules such as diffusible signal factor, which act as cell-to-cell communication molecules in bacteria and fungi.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of bacterial agents of the upper respiratory tract of school children in buea, cameroon.
AB  == the study was aimed at determining bacterial agents of the upper respiratory tract and the susceptibility patterns of isolates to antibiotics. in total, 200 throat swabs were obtained from students attending different boarding schools within the buea municipality and screened to obtain the prevalence of respiratory pathogens and to understand the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of isolates using standard microbiological procedure and the disc-diffusion test. of the 200  samples screened, 112 (56%) had positive cultures with the dominant bacterial pathogens being haemophilus influenzae (20%), followed by streptococcus pneumoniae (15%), klebsiella pneumoniae (11%), and staphylococcus aureus (10%). although 56% of the isolates were recovered from females compared to 44% from males, the difference was not statistically significant (p>0.05). sixty-seven percent of the pathogens were isolated from the age-group of 10-13 years, 19.6% from the age-group of 14-17 years, and 12.5% from the age-group of 18-21 years. antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed that gentamicin (92%) and cefuroxime (88.4%) were the most effective antibiotics against the isolates. generally, susceptibility ranged from 0% to 92% depending on the antibiotic and the species  of microorganism. penicillin had the highest (100%) resistance to all the isolates. the findings revealed that students living in boarding schools in the buea municipality were at risk of acquiring upper respiratory tract infections from their peers since the upper respiratory tract of more than 50% of the students was colonized with respiratory pathogens. although multidrug-resistant strains of organisms were identified, gentamicin and cefuroxime are recommended as the first-line antibiotics of choice against the pathogens. there is, therefore, a need for surveillance of nasopharyngeal carriage of resistant strains of these organisms, especially h. influenzae in unhealthy school children since the vaccine is yet to be introduced in cameroon. the findings have clinical and epidemiological significance.

TI  == capsule polysaccharide is a bacterial decoy for antimicrobial peptides.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides (aps) are important host weapons against infections. nearly all aps are cationic and their microbicidal action is initiated through interactions with the anionic bacterial surface. it is known that pathogens have  developed countermeasures to resist these agents by reducing the negative charge  of membranes, by active efflux and by proteolytic degradation. here we uncover a  new strategy of resistance based on the neutralization of the bactericidal activity of aps by anionic bacterial capsule polysaccharide (cps). purified cpss  from klebsiella pneumoniae k2, streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3 and pseudomonas aeruginosa increased the resistance to polymyxin b of an unencapsulated k. pneumoniae mutant. furthermore, these cpss increased the mics of polymyxin b and human neutrophil alpha-defensin 1 (hnp-1) for unencapsulated k. pneumoniae, escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa pao1. polymyxin b or hnp-1 released cps from capsulated k. pneumoniae, s. pneumoniae serotype 3 and p. aeruginosa overexpressing cps. moreover, this material also reduced the bactericidal activity of aps. we postulate that aps may trigger in vivo the release of cps, which in turn will protect bacteria against aps. we found that anionic cpss, but not cationic or uncharged ones, blocked the bactericidal activity of aps by binding them, thereby reducing the amount of peptides reaching the bacterial surface. supporting this, polycations inhibited such interaction and the bactericidal activity was restored. we postulate that trapping of aps by  anionic cpss is an additional selective virulence trait of these molecules, which could be considered as bacterial decoys for aps.

TI  == antibacterial activity of cefditoren against major community-acquired respiratory pathogens recently isolated in italy.
AB  == in this study we evaluated the in vitro activities of cefditoren--a broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin--and other comparator agents against 2,396 fresh isolates from community-acquired respiratory tract infections, collected from 6 clinical italian microbiology laboratories. on penicillin-susceptible pneumococci and streptococcus pyogenes, cefditoren demonstrated to be the most active antibiotic (mic(90)values of 0.03 and 0.06 mg/l respectively), showing only a slight decrease in potency on penicillin-intermediate and resistant pneumococci (mic(90)value 0.5 mg/l, 1.0 mg/l respectively). all the other comparators displayed mic(90 )values of 4 - 8 mg/l for penicillins and of 4 to >64 mg/l for the oral cephalosporins. cefditoren and levofloxacin were the most active against mssa (mic(90)0.5 mg/ml). cefditoren displayed a uniformly potent inhibitory activity (mic(90)of 0.03 mg/l) against all strains of haemophilus influenzae, regardless of their ampicillin resistance (mediated or not by beta-lactamase production), while against moraxella catarrhalis mic(90)values were higher against beta-lactamase-positive (0.25 mg/l). cefditoren was active also against klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli : in this case its activity was comparable with that of levofloxacin. in conclusion, cefditoren, due to its potent activity, is a new effective therapeutic option for the treatment of respiratory tract infections.

TI  == [nationwide susceptibility surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antimicrobials against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--third ciproxan injection special survey (2005)].
AB  == we conducted 3 nationwide surveillance studies between 2001 and 2005 at 39 participating institutions throughout japan according to the special survey plan  to investigate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (cpfx) and various parenteral antimicrobials using clinical isolates from patients with severe infection during the reexamination period of parenteral cpfx. results of the first special survey  (2001) were already reported in this journal. the current third special survey (2005) was conducted at 34 participating institutions throughout japan to determine susceptibility to cpfx and 22 various parenteral antimicrobials with the use of the microdilution method with respect to 1696 strains isolated and identified from various clinical specimens between january and june 2005. the results of cpfx in this survey were compared with those in the first and second special surveys. the minimum inhibitory concentration of cpfx at which 90% of isolates were susceptible (mic90) ranged from < or =0.063 to 2 microg/ml for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella spp., citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., proteus spp., serratia marcescens, and acinetobacter baumannii, revealing no marked change from results of the first and second surveys. however, the cpfx-susceptibility rate of escherichia coli decreased in the second and third surveys compared to that in the first survey. for morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mic90 of cpfx tended to increase with time. the cpfx-susceptibility rates calculated from the pneumonia breakpoint were 85.2% for p. aeruginosa and 67.9% for stenotrophomonas maltophilia. with the exception of these 2 species, major causative organisms of  respiratory tract infection had susceptibility rates as high as 90% or more for cpfx, which were similar to results of the first and second special surveys. these susceptibility rates for cpfx were similar to the rates for cefozopran and  imipenem. these values generally indicated favorable cpfx susceptibility testing  results of major bacteria and the potent antimicrobial activity of cpfx particularly against gram-negative bacteria. further surveillance is required regarding the trend in susceptibility of e. coli, m. morganii, and p. aeruginosa, which tended to become less susceptible with time.

TI  == a study on nosocomial pathogens in icu with special reference to multiresistant acinetobacter baumannii harbouring multiple plasmids.
AB  == background & objectives: antibiotic resistant bacterial nosocomial infections are a leading problem in intensive care units (icu). present investigation was undertaken to know antibiotic resistance in acinetobacter baumannii and some other pathogens obtained from clinical samples from icu causing nosocomial infections. special emphasis was given on plasmid mediated transferable antibiotic resistance in acinetobacter. methods: the clinical specimens obtained  from icu, were investigated to study distribution of nosocomial pathogens (272) and their antibiotic resistance profile. acinetobacter isolates were identified by api2one system. antimicrobial resistance was studied with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) by double dilution agar plate method. the plasmid profile of  26 antibiotic resistant isolates of acinetobacter was studied. curing of r-plasmids was determined in three antibiotic resistant plasmid containing a. baumannii isolates. plasmid transfer was studied by transformation. results: major infections found in icu were due to acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. the infection rate was maximum in urinary tract (44.4%) followed by wound infections (29.4%), pneumonia (10.7%) and bronchitis (7.4%). acinetobacter isolates displayed high level of antibiotic resistance (up to 1024microg/ml) to most of antibiotics. more than 90 per cent isolates of acinetobacter were resistant to a minimum of 23 antibiotics. plasmid profile of acinetobacter isolates showed presence of 1-4 plasmids. ethidium bromide cured plasmids pupi280, pupi281, pupi282 with curing efficiencies 20, 16 and 11 per cent respectively while acridine orange cured plasmids pupi280, pupi281 with curing efficiencies 7 and 18 per cent retrospectively. transformation frequency of e. coli hb101 with pupi281 was 4.3 x 10(4) transformants/microg plasmid dna. interpretation & conclusions: a. baumannii was found to be associated with urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections, septicaemia, bacteraemia, meningitis and wound infections. a. baumannii displayed higher resistance to more number of antibiotics than other nosocomial pathogens from icu. antibiotic sensitivity of a. baumannii cured isolates confirmed plasmid borne nature of antibiotic resistance markers. transfer of antibiotic resistant plasmids from acinetobacter to other nosocomial pathogens can create complications in the treatment of the patient. therefore, it is very important to target acinetobacter which is associated with nosocomial infections.

TI  == highly resistant microorganisms in a teaching hospital: the role of horizontal spread in a setting of endemicity.
AB  == objective: to determine the incidence density of highly resistant organisms (hros) and the relative contribution of horizontal spread in a setting of endemicity. methods: prospective surveillance was performed among hospitalized patients during an 18-month period. enterobacteriaceae, nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecium--all considered highly resistant, according to dutch guidelines--were included. epidemiological linkage and nosocomial transmission were determined on the basis of molecular typing and hospital admission data. results: from 119 patients, we recovered a total of 170 unique hro isolates, as follows: escherichia coli, 96 isolates; klebsiella species, 11 isolates; enterobacter species, 8 isolates; proteus species, 9 isolates; citrobacter species, 5 isolates; pseudomonas species, 5 isolates; acinetobacter species, 3 isolates; morganella species, 2 isolates; salmonella species, 1 isolate; serratia species, 1 isolate; s. pneumoniae, 20 isolates; and s. aureus, 9 isolates. no vancomycin-resistant e. faecium was found. the incidence density was 4.3 hro isolates per 10,000 patient-days. the majority of hro isolates were unique, and nosocomial transmission was observed 4 times for highly resistant gram-negative bacilli (case reproduction rate, 0.05) and 4 times for penicillin-nonsusceptible  s. pneumoniae (case reproduction rate, 0.29). a stay on the intensive care unit was the main determinant for the recovery of an hro. conclusion: nosocomial transmission of hros was observed 8 times during the 18-month period. the intensive care unit was identified as the main reservoir of horizontal spread of  hros. this study shows that nosocomial transmission of hros is largely preventable using transmission precautions.

TI  == [the analysis of the bacterial and fungal flora in maxillary sinuses in patients  operated due to fess method].
AB  == introduction: the aim of this work was to analyse the bacterial and fungal flora  in maxillary sinuses in patients operated due to the fess method. material and methods: studies were conducted on 110 patients, including 47 women aged 17-78 and 63 men aged 17-66, who underwent endoscopic surgical procedures due to chronic polypoid maxillary sinusitis between 2006 and 2007. 214 cultures were prepared altogether. during the endoscopic operation on paranasal sinuses, a cannula was introduced along the natural entrance and material for the culture and antibiogram was removed by suction. results: in the studied material of 214 cultures, 72 (33.6%) cultures obtained positive results, including 2 cases with bacterial and fungal floras present simultaneously (aspergillus fumigatus and aspergillus niger) in 38 operated patients. in 25 (34.5%) cultures we noted the presence of staphylococcus epidermidis, which was sensitive to the following antibiotics: cotrimoxazole, rifampicin, vankomycin, teicoplanin and levofloxacin. staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 22 (31.0%) cultures, showing 100% sensitivity to similar antibiotics like the previous one. another bacteria (escherichia coli) was cultured in 10 cultures (13.8%), in 70% of the cases every second bacteria was staphylococcus epidermidis with 100% sensitivity mainly to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. in 3 cultures (4.17%) we found klebsiella pneumoniae, with 100% sensitivity to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and 100%  resistance to penicillins. in three cases pseudomonas fluorescens and proteus mirabilis (4.17% each) were cultured with their sensitivity and resistance similar to those of klebsiella pneumoniae. two cases (2.8% each) in the cultures  were noted: citrobacter freundii, streptococcus oralis and hafnia alvei, which were 100% sensitive to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides whereas their resistance to penicillins and cefuroxime was as high as 100%. conclusion: in the  operated patients suffering from chronic polypoid maxillary sinuses we found 33.6% of positive results in the bacterial flora. this indicates that the changes were accompanied by an acute inflammatory condition, thus surgical procedures had to be followed by a guided antibiotic. the cultured bacteria demonstrated sensitivity to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and resistance to penicillins, which proves the abuse of penicillins in the treatment of acute inflammatory states of upper airways.

TI  == sitafloxacin hydrate for bacterial infections.
AB  == sitafloxacin hydrate (du-6859a, gracevit), a new-generation, broad-spectrum oral  fluoroquinolone that is very active against many gram-positive, gram-negative and anaerobic clinical isolates, including strains resistant to other fluoroquinolones, was recently approved in japan for the treatment of respiratory and urinary tract infections. sitafloxacin is active against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae and other streptococci with reduced susceptibility to levofloxacin and other quinolones and enterococci. sitafloxacin has also demonstrated activity against clinical isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae (including about 67% of strains producing extended-spectrum, beta-lactamases and resistant to ciprofloxacin), enterobacter  cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa with some activity against quinolone-resistant strains and acinetobacter baumannii. the in vitro activity against anaerobes is comparable to imipenem or metronidazole. in a published phase ii randomized, open-label, multicenter study of patients hospitalized with pneumonia, sitafloxacin (400 mg once daily) was comparable to imipenem/cilastatin (500 mg three times a day). results of the phase iii trials of sitafloxacin are not available in english. the clinical safety profile of sitafloxacin has been characterized from 1,059 patients who participated in 10 clinical trials. the most common events with 50 or 100 mg twice daily were gastrointestinal disorders  (17.2%), mostly diarrhea, and abnormal laboratory test results (16.2%), mostly liver enzyme elevations. for japanese patients, sitafloxacin provides the broad-spectrum coverage promised by clinafloxacin and trovafloxacin and comparable to carbapenems. while it is currently limited by its potential for phototoxicity in caucasians, phototoxicity is essentially irrelevant if sitafloxacin is used in hospitals and especially in intensive care units.

TI  == clinical and microbiological characteristics of mycotic aneurysms in a medical center in southern taiwan.
AB  == background and purpose: mycotic aneurysm poses a high risk of mortality. this study evaluated the demographic and clinical characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized patients with mycotic aneurysm. methods: patients with mycotic aneurysm hospitalized between march 1996 and may 2006 at a medical center in southern taiwan were retrospectively analyzed. results: fifty two patients (38 men and 14 women; mean age, 64.5 +/- 15.6 years) were included. the leading underlying diseases were diabetes mellitus (40.4%), hypertension (21.2%), and renal disease and heart disease (19.2% each). the most common pathogens isolated  from blood and/or resected tissue were salmonella spp. (34.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (11.5%) and staphylococcus aureus (11.5%). mycotic aneurysms caused by gram-negative bacilli were significantly more likely to occur in older patients (p=0.018) and at infrarenal sites (p=0.021). there were trends suggesting that mycotic aneurysms were more likely to be caused by gram-negative bacilli in patients receiving steroid treatment and in those with underlying diabetes mellitus. mycotic aneurysms caused by gram-positive cocci were significantly more likely to occur in suprarenal arteries (p=0.048), especially intracranially (p=0.002), in younger patients (p=0.018) and in patients with concurrent endocarditis (p=0.008). the overall in-hospital mortality rate was 30.6%, and there was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality between mycotic aneurysms caused by gram-negative bacilli and those due to gram-positive cocci. conclusions: the relationship between the anatomic site of mycotic aneurysm and the spectrum of culprit bacteria may help clinicians promptly choose appropriate  antibiotic regimens on an empirical basis. further study is required to understand better the role of k. pneumoniae in mycotic aneurysm in taiwan.

TI  == effect of electrical current on the activities of antimicrobial agents against pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms.
AB  == bacterial biofilms are resistant to conventional antimicrobial agents. prior in vitro studies have shown that electrical current (ec) enhances the activities of  aminoglycosides, quinolones, and oxytetracycline against pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, and streptococcus gordonii. this phenomenon, known as the bioelectric effect, has been only partially defined. the purpose of this work was to study the in vitro bioelectric effect on the activities of 11 antimicrobial agents representing a variety of different classes against p. aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and s. epidermidis. an eight-channel current generator/controller and eight chambers delivering a continuous flow of fresh medium with or without antimicrobial agents and/or ec to biofilm-coated coupons were used. no significant decreases in the numbers of log(10) cfu/cm(2) were seen after exposure to antimicrobial agents alone, with the exception of a 4.57-log-unit reduction for s. epidermidis and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. we  detected a statistically significant bioelectric effect when vancomycin plus 2,000 microamperes ec were used against mrsa biofilms (p = 0.04) and when daptomycin and erythromycin were used in combination with 200 or 2,000 microamperes ec against s. epidermidis biofilms (p = 0.02 and 0.0004, respectively). the results of these experiments indicate that the enhancement of  the activity of antimicrobial agents against biofilm organisms by ec is not a generalizable phenomenon across microorganisms and antimicrobial agents.

AB  == ceftobiprole medocaril is the parenteral prodrug of ceftobiprole, a novel pyrrolidinone broad-spectrum cephalosporin with in vitro and in vivo bactericidal activities against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp). we have used murine thigh and lung infection models in neutropenic and normal mice to characterize the in vivo pharmacokinetic (pk)-pharmacodynamic (pd) activities of ceftobiprole against multiple strains of s. aureus (including mrsa), s. pneumoniae (including prsp), and gram-negative bacilli. serum levels of ceftobiprole following the administration of multiple doses were determined by a microbiological assay. in vivo bactericidal activities and postantibiotic effects (paes) of ceftobiprole against mrsa and prsp strains were determined from serial cfu/thigh values following single doses of ceftobiprole (40 and 160 mg/kg of body weight). dose fractionation studies were used to determine which pk-pd index correlated best with activity. magnitudes of the pk-pd indices were calculated from mics and pk parameters. a sigmoid dose-response model was used to estimate the dose (mg/kg/24 h) required to achieve a static and 2-log(10) kill effects over 24 h. pk results  showed area under the concentration-time curve/dose values of 1.8 to 2.8 and half-lives of 0.29 to 0.51 h. mics ranged from 0.015 to 2 microg/ml. ceftobiprole demonstrated time-dependent killing; its in vivo paes varied from 3.8 h to 4.8 h  for mrsa and from 0 to 0.8 h for prsp. the time above mic (t > mic) correlated best with efficacy for both mrsa and prsp. the t > mic values required for the static doses were significantly longer (p < 0.001) for enterobacteriaceae (36 to  45%) than for s. aureus (14 to 28%) and s. pneumoniae (15 to 22%). the drug showed activities in the lung model similar to those in the thigh model. the presence of neutrophils significantly enhanced the activity of ceftobiprole against s. pneumoniae but only slightly against klebsiella pneumoniae. based on its pd profile, ceftobiprole is a promising new beta-lactam agent with activity against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms including mrsa and prsp.

TI  == mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  == the crude extract and the hexane, ch(2)cl(2), etoac, n-buoh, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of leishmania (l. chagasi and l. amazonensis),  11 strains of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica sorovar tythimurium, shigella sonnei, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus pyogenes and bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (candida albicans and  cryptococcus neoformans). the antioxidant activity (dpph radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. all samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. s. sonnei, b. cereus and c. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-buoh and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. the lowest mic was recorded for the ch(2)cl(2) fraction against c. neoformans (mic of 10 microg/ml), followed by b. cereus, s. sonnei, and e. cloacae (mic of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). the ch(2)cl(2) fraction was the most effective against l. chagasi (ic(50) of 6.7  microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against  l. amazonensis (ic(50) of 9 microg/ml). a cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and ch(2)cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. these results suggest that m. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.

TI  == pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic target attainment analysis of cefozopran in japanese adult patients.
AB  == this study aimed to perform a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (pk-pd) target attainment analysis to create a dosing strategy for cefozopran in japanese adult  patients. a total of 145 plasma concentration samples from 32 adult patients were used for a population pharmacokinetic modeling and monte carlo simulation to assess the probability of attaining the pk-pd target (70% of the time above the minimum inhibitory concentration for the bacterium). the final population pharmacokinetic model was based on a two-compartment model, and creatinine clearance (cl(cr)) and body weight (bw) were the most significant covariates: cl(l/h) = 0.0263 x cl(cr) + 1.49, v (c)(l) = 0.185 x bw(0.931), q(l/h) = 4.55, v  (p)(l) = 5.86, where cl is the clearance, v (c) is the volume of distribution of  the central compartment, q is the intercompartmental clearance, and v (p) is the  volume of distribution of the peripheral compartment. the monte carlo simulation  demonstrated that 1 g q 12 h achieved a pk-pd target attainment probability of >  or =85% against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. however, against haemophilus influenzae and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, 1 g q 8 h and (2 g, 1 g, 1 g) q 8 h were required to achieve a high probability, which value varied with the cl(cr) and bw of the patient. these results provide a pk-pd-based strategy for tailoring cefozopran regimens in japanese adult patients.

TI  == survey of childhood empyema in asia: implications for detecting the unmeasured burden of culture-negative bacterial disease.
AB  == background: parapneumonic empyema continues to be a disease of significant morbidity and mortality among children despite recent advances in medical management. to date, only a limited number of studies have assessed the burden of empyema in asia. methods: we surveyed medical records of four representative large pediatric hospitals in china, korea, taiwan and vietnam using icd-10 diagnostic codes to identify children <16 years of age hospitalized with empyema  or pleural effusion from 1995 to 2005. we also accessed microbiology records of cultured empyema and pleural effusion specimens to describe the trends in the epidemiology and microbiology of empyema. results: during the study period, we identified 1,379 children diagnosed with empyema or pleural effusion (china, n =  461; korea, n = 134; taiwan, n = 119; vietnam, n = 665). diagnoses of pleural effusion (n = 1,074) were 3.5 times more common than of empyema (n = 305), although the relative proportions of empyema and pleural effusion noted in hospital records varied widely between the four sites, most likely because of marked differences in coding practices. although pleural effusions were reported  more often than empyema, children with empyema were more likely to have a cultured pathogen. in addition, we found that median age and gender distribution  of children with these conditions were similar across the four countries. among 1,379 empyema and pleural effusion specimens, 401 (29%) were culture positive. staphylococcus aureus (n = 126) was the most common organism isolated, followed by streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 83), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 37) and klebsiella (n = 35) and acinetobacter species (n = 34). conclusion: the age and gender distribution of empyema and pleural effusion in children in these countries are similar to the us and western europe. s. pneumoniae was the second  leading bacterial cause of empyema and pleural effusion among asian children. the high proportion of culture-negative specimens among patients with pleural effusion or empyema suggests that culture may not be a sufficiently sensitive diagnostic method to determine etiology in the majority of cases. future prospective studies in different countries would benefit from standardized case definitions and coding practices for empyema. in addition, more sensitive diagnostic methods would improve detection of pathogens and could result in better prevention, treatment and outcomes of this severe disease.

TI  == risk of bacteremia in bleeding and nonbleeding gastric varices after endoscopic injection of cyanoacrylate.
AB  == background and study aim: bacteremia is common in cirrhosis with gastrointestinal bleeding, including variceal bleeding. elective esophageal sclerotherapy and banding have been reported to cause bacteremia. the risk associated with therapeutic endoscopy in patients with gastric varices has not yet been reported. this study was conducted to compare the risk of bacteremia between patients with  active gastric variceal bleeding and those with gastric varices that were not actively bleeding who underwent n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate injection. patients and methods: patients were categorized into three groups: group i, patients with bleeding gastric varices who underwent cyanoacrylate injection for hemostasis (n  = 20); group ii, patients who underwent elective cyanoacrylate injection for further obliteration of gastric varices (n = 18); and group iii, patients with cirrhosis who underwent endoscopic surveillance for varices, and patients with gastric varices who presented for a follow-up endoscopy without a requirement for treatment (n = 17). blood culture was obtained before and 5 minutes and 3 hours after endoscopy. needle tips were also sent for culture. results: before procedures, blood cultures were positive in 4 patients (20 %) from group i. the number of positive blood cultures in group i at 5 minutes and 3 hours after the procedure were 3 (15 %) and 2 (10 %) respectively. the identified organisms were: klebsiella pneumoniae (2), escherichia coli (1), vibrio cholerae non-o1 (1). no patient from group ii had a positive culture at any point of blood drawn. only one in group iii had a positive culture, for streptococcus mitis at 5 minutes. no clinical evidence of infections occurred in any patient. needle-tip cultures grew mainly organisms from the oral and gastrointestinal tracts. conclusions: elective cyanoacrylate injection for nonbleeding gastric varices is not associated with significant bacteremia or infection. for this reason, prophylactic antibiotics may not be needed in this patient group. by contrast, prophylactic antibiotics are strongly recommended for patients with bleeding gastric varices undergoing cyanoacrylate injection.

TI  == adrenal gland hemorrhage in patients with fatal bacterial infections.
AB  == a wide spectrum of adrenal gland pathology is seen during bacterial infections. hemorrhage is particularly associated with meningococcemia, while abscesses have  been described with several neonatal infections. we studied adrenal gland histopathology of 65 patients with bacterial infections documented in a variety of tissues by using immunohistochemistry. the infections diagnosed included neisseria meningitidies, group a streptococcus, rickettsia rickettsii, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, ehrlichia sp., bacillus anthracis, leptospira sp., clostridium sp., klebsiella sp., legionella sp., yersinia pestis, and treponema pallidum. bacteria were detected in the adrenal of 40 (61%) cases. adrenal hemorrhage was present in 39 (60%) cases. bacteria or bacterial antigens were observed in 31 (79%) of the cases with adrenal hemorrhage including 14 with n. meningitidis, four with r. rickettsii, four with s. pneumoniae, three with group a streptococcus, two with s. aureus, two with b. anthracis, one with t. pallidum, and one with legionella sp. bacterial antigens were observed in nine of 26 non-hemorrhagic adrenal glands that showed inflammatory foci (four cases), edema (two cases), congestion (two cases), or necrosis (one case). hemorrhage is the most frequent adrenal gland pathology observed in fatal bacterial infections. bacteria and bacterial antigens are frequently seen in adrenal glands with hemorrhage and may play a pathogenic role. although n. meningitidis is the most frequent bacteria associated with adrenal gland pathology, a broad collection of bacteria can also cause adrenal lesions.

AB  == ceftobiprole is a 1st-in-class anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) extended-spectrum cephalosporin currently in clinical trials for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssis) and nosocomial pneumonia. this agent is also active against other prominent gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, making it an attractive candidate for  broad-spectrum therapy. we evaluated the in vitro potency of ceftobiprole tested  against the most commonly occurring bacterial pathogens as part of a global surveillance study for the years 2005 to 2006 (>60 medical centers in north america, latin america, and europe). all isolates (40 675) were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. ceftobiprole inhibited 100% and >99% of tested s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at < or =4 and  < or =8 microg/ml, respectively, although mic90 values for oxacillin-resistant strains were 4-fold and 8-fold higher than oxacillin-susceptible isolates for the 2 groups. ceftobiprole was also broadly active against streptococcus pneumoniae,  beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, inhibiting >98% of isolates at <  or =0.5 microg/ml. although ceftobiprole was generally inactive against enterococcus faecium, the majority of enterococcus faecalis strains (95.7%) were  inhibited at < or =4 microg/ml. this agent was similar in potency to the "3rd- and 4th-generation" cephems (mic50 values, < or =0.06 microg/ml) for all tested enterobacteriaceae. although cefepime provided enhanced coverage against klebsiella spp. (86.5% at < or =8 microg/ml versus 76.9-81.7% for ceftobiprole and ceftazidime), ceftobiprole and cefepime were superior to ceftazidime against  enterobacter spp. and citrobacter spp. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftobiprole was equal in potency to ceftazidime (mic50, 2 microg/ml) and 2-fold  more potent than cefepime. none of these agents inhibited >45% of acinetobacter spp. at 8 mug/ml. ceftobiprole is a new anti-mrsa beta-lactam with recognized activity against the most commonly occurring enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, similar to that of extended-spectrum cephems. these characteristics warrant continued evaluation of the agent as empiric therapy for csssis, and in pneumonia, especially in those institutions/regions where mrsa and p. aeruginosa  may be prevalent.

TI  == assessing genetic heterogeneity within bacterial species isolated from gastrointestinal and environmental samples: how many isolates does it take?
AB  == strain typing of bacterial isolates is increasingly used to identify sources of infection or product contamination and to elucidate routes of transmission of pathogens or spoilage organisms. usually, the number of bacterial isolates belonging to the same species that is analyzed per sample is determined by convention, convenience, laboratory capacity, or financial resources. statistical considerations and knowledge of the heterogeneity of bacterial populations in various sources can be used to determine the number of isolates per sample that is actually needed to address specific research questions. we present data for intestinal escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, and streptococcus uberis from gastrointestinal, fecal, or soil samples characterized  by ribotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and pcr-based strain-typing methods. in contrast to previous studies, all calculations were performed with a  single computer program, employing software that is freely available and with in-depth explanation of the choice and derivation of prior distributions. also, some of the model assumptions were relaxed to allow analysis of the special case  of two (groups of) strains that are observed with different probabilities. sample size calculations, with a bayesian method of inference, show that from 2 to 20 isolates per sample need to be characterized to detect all strains that are present in a sample with 95% certainty. such high numbers of isolates per sample  are rarely typed in real life due to financial or logistic constraints. this implies that investigators are not gaining maximal information on strain heterogeneity and that sources and transmission pathways may go undetected.

TI  == frequency of isolation and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bacterial isolates from blood culture, gondar university teaching hospital, northwest ethiopia.
AB  == background: bacterial bloodstream infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality, with up to one-quarter of affected patients dying as a result of their infection. up-to-date information on blood culture isolates and their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern is very important as guide for immediate prescription of antimicrobial agents and monitoring of emergence of drug resistant strains. objective: to determine the frequency of blood culture isolation and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of isolates in gondar university teaching hospital. methods: this was retrospective analysis of records of blood culture results for febrile patients seen at gondar university teaching  hospital, bacteriology section from march 2001 to april 2005. results: during the four years period, blood cultures were done for a total of 472 febrile patients.  among these, 233 (49.4%) were females and 239 (50.6%) were males. the median age  was 20.5 years (age range of 2 hours to 78 years). out of these, total of 114 bacterial strains were isolated with culture positivity rate of 24.2%. coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) were isolated with the highest frequency  in 38 (33.3%), followed by staphylococcus aureus in 34 (29.8%), salmonella species other than salmonella typhi in 12 (10.5%), klebsiella species in 10 (8.8%), streptococcus pneumoniae in 6 (5.3%), salmonella typhi in 4 (3.5%), enterobacter species in 3 (2.6%), escherichia coli in 2 (1.7%). the gram positive and gram negative bacteria constituted 80 (70.2%) and 34 (29.8%) of the culture isolates, respectively. culture positivity rates vary as for neonates, 63% (17 out of 27);followed by 25.6% (36 out of 141) in children and 20% (61 out of 304)  in adults. the isolates especially gram negative bacteria showed multiple drug resistance, to ampicillin and penicillin. however, ciprofloxacin is fairly effective against both gram negative and gram positive isolates. conclusion: an effective documented data may serve as a guide for initial empirical treatment of bloodstream infections but in view of these findings the presented data is only imperative to do large-scale prospective and quantitative studies. more importantly, an ongoing surveillance for antimicrobial susceptibility is of the essence to enhance efforts to identify resistance and attempt to limit its spread.

TI  == the antibacterial and antifungal properties of trappin-2 (pre-elafin) do not depend on its protease inhibitory function.
AB  == trappin-2 (also known as pre-elafin) is an endogenous inhibitor of neutrophil serine proteases and is involved in the control of excess proteolysis, especially in inflammatory events, along with the structurally related secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor. secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor has been shown to  have antibacterial and antifungal properties, whereas recent data indicate that trappin-2 has antimicrobial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. in the present study, we tested the antibacterial properties of trappin-2 towards other respiratory pathogens. we found that trappin-2, at concentrations of 5-20 microm, has significant activity against klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis and the pathogenic fungi aspergillus fumigatus and candida albicans, in addition to p. aeruginosa and s. aureus. a similar antimicrobial activity was observed with trappin-2 a62d/m63l, a trappin-2 variant that has lost its antiprotease properties, indicating that trappin-2 exerts its antibacterial effects through mechanisms independent from its intrinsic antiprotease capacity. furthermore, the antibacterial and antifungal activities of trappin-2 were sensitive to nacl and heparin, demonstrating that its mechanism of action is most probably dependent on its cationic nature. this enables trappin-2 to interact with the membranes of target organisms and disrupt them, as shown by our scanning electron microscopy analyses. thus, trappin-2 not only provides an antiprotease shield, but also may play an important role in the innate defense of the human lungs and mucosae against pathogenic microorganisms.

TI  == comparative activity of meropenem in us medical centers (2007): initiating the 2nd decade of mystic program surveillance.
AB  == since 1997, the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) program has monitored the antimicrobial activity of broad-spectrum agents against pathogens from hospitalized patients. in the united states, 2894 isolates were submitted in 2007 from 15 sites, including 1392 enterobacteriaceae, 643 nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli, and 829 gram-positive cocci. all isolates were tested by broth microdilution methods. meropenem (mic(90) range, 0.12-2 microg/ml) exhibited the lowest resistance rates (1.9-2.4%) against enterobacteriaceae, and fluoroquinolones had the highest rates of resistance (17.3-18.3%). kpc carbapenemases, usually found in klebsiella pneumoniae, were also detected in citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., and escherichia coli. confirmed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing isolate rates for e. coli, klebsiella spp., and proteus mirabilis isolates were 6.0%, 12.0%, and 0.0%, respectively. meropenem remained active against gram-positive pathogens such as staphylococci (methicillin-susceptible; mic(90), 0.12-0.25 microg/ml), streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml), and beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci (mic(90) range, 0.06-0.25 microg/ml). these us mystic program results demonstrate the continued emergence of novel beta-lactamases and  multidrug-resistant bacterial phenotypes necessitating monitoring of carbapenem activities against enterobacteriaceae species as well as nonfermentative bacilli.

TI  == in vitro activities of tigecycline combined with other antimicrobials against multiresistant gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens.
AB  == objectives: to test the activity of tigecycline combined with 16 antimicrobials in vitro against 22 gram-positive and 55 gram-negative clinical isolates. methods: antibiotic interactions were determined by chequerboard and time-kill methods. results: by chequerboard, of 891 organism-drug interactions tested, 97 (11%) were synergistic, 793 (89%) were indifferent and 1 (0.1%) was antagonistic. among gram-positive pathogens, most synergisms occurred against enterococcus spp. (7/11 isolates) with the tigecycline/rifampicin combination. no antagonism was detected. among gram-negative organisms, synergism was observed mainly with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole against serratia marcescens (5/5 isolates), proteus spp. (2/5) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (2/5), with aztreonam against s. maltophilia (3/5), with cefepime and imipenem against enterobacter cloacae (3/5), with ceftazidime against morganella morganii (3/5), and with ceftriaxone against  klebsiella pneumoniae (3/5). the only case of antagonism occurred against one s.  marcescens with the tigecycline/imipenem combination. selected time-kill assays confirmed the bacteriostatic interactions observed by the chequerboard method. moreover, they revealed a bactericidal synergism of tigecycline with piperacillin/tazobactam against one penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and with amikacin against proteus vulgaris. conclusions: combinations of tigecycline with other antimicrobials produce primarily an indifferent response.  specific synergisms, especially against enterococci and problematic gram-negative isolates, might be worth investigating in in vitro models and/or in animal models simulating the human environment.

TI  == picomolar inhibitors as transition-state probes of 5'-methylthioadenosine nucleosidases.
AB  == transition states can be predicted from an enzyme's affinity to related transition-state analogues. 5'-methylthioadenosine nucleosidases (mtans) are involved in bacterial quorum sensing pathways and thus are targets for antibacterial drug design. the transition-state characteristics of six mtans are  compared by analyzing dissociation constants (k(d)) with a small array of representative transition-state analogues. these inhibitors mimic early or late dissociative transition states with k(d) values in the picomolar range. our results indicate that the k(d) ratio for mimics of early and late transition states are useful in distinguishing between these states. by this criterion, the  transition states of neisseria meningitides and helicobacter pylori mtans are early dissociative, whereas escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and klebsiella pneumoniae mtans have late dissociative  characters. this conclusion is confirmed independently by the characteristic [1'- (3)h] and [1'- (14)c] kinetic isotope effects (kies) of these enzymes. large [1'- (3)h] and unity [1'- (14)c] kies are observed for late dissociative transition states, whereas early dissociative states showed close-to-unity [1'- (3)h] and significant [1'- (14)c] kies. k d values of various mtans for individual transition-state analogues provide tentative information about transition-state structures due to varying catalytic efficiencies of enzymes. comparing k d ratios for mimics of early and late transition states removes limitations inherent to the enzyme and provides a better predictive tool in discriminating between possible transition-state structures.

TI  == inherent antibacterial activity of a peptide-based beta-hairpin hydrogel.
AB  == among several important considerations for implantation of a biomaterial, a main  concern is the introduction of infection. we have designed a hydrogel scaffold from the self-assembling peptide, max1, for tissue regeneration applications whose surface exhibits inherent antibacterial activity. in experiments where max1 gels are challenged with bacterial solutions ranging in concentrations from 2 x 10(3) colony forming units (cfus)/dm2 to 2 x 10(9) cfus/dm2, gel surfaces exhibit broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. results show that the hydrogel surface is  active against gram-positive (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus,  and streptococcus pyogenes) and gram-negative (klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli) bacteria, all prevalent in hospital settings. live-dead assays  employing laser scanning confocal microscopy show that bacteria are killed when they engage the surface. in addition, the surface of max1 hydrogels was shown to  cause inner and outer membrane disruption in experiments that monitor the release of beta-galactosidase from the cytoplasm of lactose permease-deficient e. coli ml-35. these data suggest a mechanism of antibacterial action that involves membrane disruption that leads to cell death upon cellular contact with the gel surface. although the hydrogel surface exhibits bactericidal activity, co-culture experiments indicate hydrogel surfaces show selective toxicity to bacterial versus mammalian cells. additionally, gel surfaces are nonhemolytic toward human  erythrocytes, which maintain healthy morphologies when in contact with the surface. these material attributes make max1 gels attractive candidates for use in tissue regeneration, even in nonsterile environments.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of dc-159a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == dc-159a is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that possesses a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, with extended activity against gram-positive pathogens, especially streptococci and staphylococci from patients with community-acquired infections. dc-159a showed activity against streptococcus spp. (mic(90), 0.12 microg/ml) and inhibited the growth of 90% of levofloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains at 1 microg/ml. the mic 90s of dc-159a against staphylococcus  spp. were 0.5 microg/ml or less. against quinolone- and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains, however, the mic 90 of dc-159a was 8 microg/ml. dc-159a was the most active against enterococcus spp. (mic 90, 4 to 8 microg/ml)  and was more active than the marketed fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. the mic 90s of dc-159a against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.015, 0.06, and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. the activity of dc-159a against mycoplasma pneumoniae was eightfold more potent than that of levofloxacin. the mics of dc-159a against chlamydophila pneumoniae were comparable to those of moxifloxacin, and dc-159a was more potent than levofloxacin. the mic 90s of dc-159a against peptostreptococcus spp., clostridium difficile, and bacteroides fragilis were 0.5, 4, and 2 microg/ml, respectively; and among the quinolones tested it showed the highest level of activity against anaerobic organisms. dc-159a demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against quinolone-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains both in vitro and in vivo. in vitro, dc-159a showed faster killing than moxifloxacin and garenoxacin. the bactericidal activity of dc-159a in a murine muscle infection model was revealed to be superior to that of moxifloxacin. these activities carried over to the in vivo efficacy in the murine pneumonia model, in which treatment with dc-159a led to bactericidal activity superior to those of the other agents tested.

TI  == leptin improves pulmonary bacterial clearance and survival in ob/ob mice during pneumococcal pneumonia.
AB  == the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin is an important regulator of appetite and energy expenditure and is now appreciated for its ability to control innate and adaptive immune responses. we have reported previously that the leptin-deficient  ob/ob mouse exhibited increased susceptibility to the gram-negative bacterium klebsiella pneumoniae. in this report we assessed the impact of chronic leptin deficiency, using ob/ob mice, on pneumococcal pneumonia and examined whether restoring circulating leptin to physiological levels in vivo could improve host defences against this pathogen. we observed that ob/ob mice, compared with wild-type (wt) animals, exhibited enhanced lethality and reduced pulmonary bacterial clearance following streptococcus pneumoniae challenge. these impairments in host defence in ob/ob mice were associated with elevated levels of lung tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, macrophage inflammatory peptide (mip)-2  [correction added after online publication 28 september 2007: definition of mip corrected], prostaglandin e(2) (pge(2)), lung neutrophil polymorphonuclear leukocyte (pmn) counts, defective alveolar macrophage (am) phagocytosis and pmn killing of s. pneumoniae in vitro. exogenous leptin administration to ob/ob mice  in vivo improved survival and greatly improved pulmonary bacterial clearance, reduced bacteraemia, reconstituted am phagocytosis and pmn h(2)o(2) production and killing of s. pneumoniae in vitro. our results demonstrate, for the first time, that leptin improves pulmonary bacterial clearance and survival in ob/ob mice during pneumococcal pneumonia. further investigations are warranted to determine whether there is a potential therapeutic role for this adipokine in immunocompromised patients.

TI  == crystal structure of cefditoren complexed with streptococcus pneumoniae penicillin-binding protein 2x: structural basis for its high antimicrobial activity.
AB  == cefditoren is the active form of cefditoren pivoxil, an oral cephalosporin antibiotic used for the treatment of respiratory tract infections and otitis media caused by bacteria such as streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, and methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus. beta-lactam antibiotics, including cefditoren, target penicillin-binding proteins (pbps), which are membrane-associated enzymes that play essential roles in the peptidoglycan biosynthetic process. to envision the binding of cefditoren to pbps, we determined the crystal structure of a trypsin-digested form of pbp 2x from s. pneumoniae strain r6 complexed with cefditoren. there are two pbp 2x molecules (designated molecules 1 and 2) per asymmetric unit. the structure reveals that the orientation of trp374 in each molecule changes in a different way upon the formation of the complex, but each forms a hydrophobic pocket. the methylthiazole group of the c-3 side chain of cefditoren fits into this binding pocket, which consists of residues his394, trp374, and thr526 in molecule 1 and residues his394, asp375, and thr526 in molecule 2. the formation of the complex is also accompanied by an induced-fit conformational change of the enzyme in the  pocket to which the c-7 side chain of cefditoren binds. these features likely play a role in the high level of activity of cefditoren against s. pneumoniae.

TI  == prevention of transfusion of platelet components contaminated with low levels of  bacteria: a comparison of bacteria culture and pathogen inactivation methods.
AB  == background: this study compared the efficacy of bacterial detection with inactivation for reducing the risk associated with transfusion of platelet (plt)  components contaminated with low levels of bacteria. study design and methods: twenty-one double-dose plts were spiked with seven species of bacteria at three levels (0.003-0.03, 0.03-0.3, 0.3-3 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml). after split, each plt unit contained 1 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000 cfus. one unit was photochemically treated (pct; 150 micromol/l amotosalen and 3 j/cm(2) ultraviolet a). the other unit was untreated. all units were stored and sampled on days 1, 2, and 5 of storage for aerobic and anaerobic culture in the bact/alert system (biomerieux). plts were classified as sterile when no bacterial growth was detected after 120 hours of culture. results: in all pct plts, no bacteria were detected throughout 5 days of storage regardless of species, level of contamination, and sampling time. in untreated plts, staphylococcus aureus was consistently detected by culturing. growth of 1 to 10 cfus per unit staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 to 100 cfus per unit of klebsiella pneumoniae, and  1 to 1000 cfus per unit propionibacterium acnes was delayed and only detectable after 5, 2, and 5 days of storage, respectively. low levels of streptococcus agalactiae (1-10 cfus/unit), escherichia coli (1-100 cfus/unit), and clostridium  perfringens (1-100 cfus/unit) were not detected during 5 days of storage, although bacterial outgrowth was detected at higher levels of contamination. conclusions: for the seven bacterial species examined, contaminated plts may be released for transfusion on test-negative-to-date status. in contrast, bacterial  inactivation by pct could reduce the risk associated with transfusion of plts contaminated with low levels of these bacteria.

TI  == [drug-resistant bacteria isolated from pharyngeal swab cultures and urine in acutely or chronically febrile elderly nursing home inmates].
AB  == aim: patients in nursing homes are becoming more and more elderly and also prone  to infectious diseases. it is important to select proper antimicrobial agents in  treating such patients because of the increase in drug-resistant bacteria in recent years. methods: pathogenic aerobic bacteria were isolated from cultures of the pharyngeal swab obtained from patients with acute febrile episodes and those  with chronic febrile conditions with a repetition of fever or continuing low-grade fever. isolation of pathogens was also carried out in patients with a urinary tract infection that was resistant to treatment. isolated bacteria were tested for sensitivity to commonly used antimicrobial agents. results: pathogenic bacteria were isolated from 33% of the patients with acute febrile episodes, while they were isolated from 75% of the patients with chronic febrile conditions. the number of major pathogenic bacteria from 85 isolates were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) 13, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa) 6, streptococcus pneumoniae 8, beta-hemolytic streptococcus 5, klebsiella pneumoniae 10, and enterobacter cloacae 6. only two isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae were penicillin-sensitive (pssp), while the  others were penicillin-resistant (prsp) (1) or penicillin-insensitive (pisp) (5). among these 8 isolates, 5 were resistant to levofloxacin (lvfx). escherichia coli was isolated from the pharyngeal swab of 2 patients, one of the 2 isolates being  resistant to lvfx. escherichia coli was isolated from 5 patients with urinary tract infection and 5 of the 6 isolates were resistant to lvfx; with one of them  being extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl). conclusion: the frequency of isolation of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens was extremely high among elderly patients in our nursing home compared to values reported from a nation-wide survey recently carried out in japan. in particular, attention should be focused  on the resistance of bacteria to fluoroquinolones.

TI  == complicated parapneumonic effusion and empyema thoracis: microbiology and predictors of adverse outcomes.
AB  == objectives: to describe the microbiological characteristics of a cohort of patients with complicated parapneumonic effusion and empyema thoracis, and to identify the potential risk factors for adverse outcomes, with particular reference to the choice of empirical antibiotics, intrapleural fibrinolytics, adherence to management guidelines, and input from pulmonologists. design: retrospective review. setting: regional hospital, hong kong. patients: all patients with a diagnosis of complicated parapneumonic effusion/empyema thoracis  admitted between january 2003 and june 2005. main outcome measures: microbiological characteristics, mortality, and surgery-free survival. results. there were 63 patients, with a mean age of 64 (standard deviation, 16) years and  a male-to-female ratio of 45:18. the pleural fluid culture positivity rate was 68%; streptococcus milleri (19%), bacteroides (14%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12%), and peptostreptococcus (7%) were the most common organisms. thirteen (21%) patients died during their index admission. use of intrapleural fibrinolytics according to the guideline was associated with survival (p=0.001) while discordant initial antibiotic use was associated with mortality (p=0.002). discordant initial antibiotic use was also independently associated with reduced  surgery-free survival (p<0.001). subgroup analysis showed that early intrapleural fibrinolytic use (within 4 days of diagnosis) was associated with decreased mortality (p<0.001), increased surgery-free survival (p=0.005), and shorter hospital stay (p=0.039). conclusion: organisms identified from complicated parapneumonic effusion and empyema thoracis differ from those giving rise to community-acquired pneumonia. in these patients, adherence to guidelines, early concordant antibiotic treatment, intrapleural fibrinolytics, and input from a pulmonologist were associated with improved outcomes.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline (ppi-0903m, t-91825) against bacteria with defined resistance mechanisms and phenotypes.
AB  == background: ceftaroline (ppi-0903m, t-91825) is a novel cephalosporin, administered as an n-phosphono prodrug. we investigated its in vitro activity and resistance selection potential. methods: mics were determined by clsi agar dilution, but with varied inocula. mutant selection was investigated in single- and multi-step procedures. results: mics for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) were 0.5-2 mg/l, compared with 0.12-0.25 mg/l for methicillin-susceptible s. aureus; corresponding values for coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.25-2 and 0.06-0.12 mg/l, respectively. even with 2% nacl added, all mrsa were susceptible at 2 mg/l. mics for enterococcus faecalis were from 0.25 to 8 mg/l; e. faecium was resistant. mics for escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., morganella morganii and proteeae without acquired resistance were 0.06-0.5 mg/l versus 0.12-1 mg/l for enterobacter, serratia and citrobacter  spp. and 2-8 mg/l for acinetobacter spp. mics rose to 1-2 mg/l for many enterobacteriaceae with classical tem beta-lactamases, and were much higher for those with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), hyperproduced ampc or k1 enzymes. mics for strains with classical tem/shv beta-lactamases rose if the inoculum was increased to 10(6) cfu/spot; this effect was even more marked for those with esbls. resistance due to class a beta-lactamases was reversed by clavulanate. geometric mean mics were 0.005, 0.05 and 0.09 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains, respectively-lower than for any comparator beta-lactam. haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were very susceptible, although with marginally raised mics for beta-lactamase-positive moraxella strains and for haemophili with chromosomal ampicillin resistance. ceftaroline selected ampc-derepressed enterobacter mutants similarly to cefotaxime in single-step experiments; in multi-step procedures it selected esbl variants of blatem in e. coli. resistance selection was not seen with s. aureus, h. influenzae or pneumococci. conclusions: ceftaroline has impressive anti-mrsa and anti-pneumococcal activity. slight lability to classical tem and shv beta-lactamases is exceptional for an oxyimino-cephalosporin, but was reversible  with clavulanate, as was the greater resistance mediated by esbls. resistance selection occurred with enterobacteriaceae, not mrsa.

TI  == early evolution of arterial oxygenation in severe community-acquired pneumonia: a prospective observational study.
AB  == purpose: acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation in severe community-acquired pneumonia has been shown to be a significant negative prognostic factor. we analyzed the early evolution of the pao(2)/fio(2) ratio and evaluated its clinical value as an outcome predictor. materials and methods: this is a prospective study conducted in a tertiary referral hospital. in 62 adult patients requiring early mechanical ventilation due to severe community-acquired  pneumonia, we measured serial changes in pao(2)/fio(2) ratio and other clinical variables within the first 48 hours of mechanical ventilation and compared the difference between survivors and nonsurvivors. results: the initial pao(2)/fio(2) ratio was lower in nonsurvivors (n = 27) than in survivors (n = 35) (158.0 +/- 55.8 vs 117.9 +/- 50.6, p = .025). over the next 48 hours, the ratio increased significantly in survivors but not in nonsurvivors (analysis of variance, p < .001). an increase in pao(2)/fio(2) ratio greater than 56 mm hg had a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 81% of survival. a definite causative pathogen was identified in 36 patients (58%) and the 3 most commonly isolated pathogens were streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and klebsiella pneumoniae. ten patients received inadequate initial empirical antimicrobial therapy, in which the pao(2)/fio(2) ratio change was significantly less than those who were adequately treated (analysis of variance, p < .001). mortality was much higher (86% [6/7]) in patients who received inadequate antibiotics and where pao(2)/fio(2) ratio change was less than 56 mm hg. on multivariate analysis, trend changes in pao(2)/fio(2) ratio over 48 hours, shock, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii score were documented to be independent predictors of mortality. conclusions: a progressive improvement of pao(2)/fio(2)  ratio during the first 48 hours of mechanical ventilation indicates favorable outcome. serial measurement of this ratio should be considered in decision making for therapeutic strategy.

TI  == in vitro availability studies of enoxacin in presence of h2 receptor antagonists.
AB  == enoxacin is a second-generation quinolone with increased antibacterial activity both in potency as well as in terms of broad spectrum against a wide range of clinically important pathogens over the first generation quinolones and produces  its effect by inhibiting bacterial enzyme dna gyrase. there are a number of drug  interactions reported for enoxacin. on the other hand h2-receptor antagonists block gastric acid secretion and some cardiovascular effects of histamine. as the later drugs are used for a long-term therapy, they may be coadministered with other drugs. in present study in vitro release of enoxacin in presence of cimetidine, ranitidine and famotidine has been studied on a b.p. 2003 dissolution test apparatus and compared with the availability of enoxacin and h2-receptor antagonists alone. the interacting drugs were analyzed spectrophotometrically. these studies were carried out in simulated gastric juice, simulating empty stomach, simulated intestinal juice (ph 9) and buffers of ph 7.4 simulating blood ph at 37 degrees c. in order to support these interaction studies, the effect of  h2-receptor antagonists on the antibacterial efficacy (mic) of enoxacin was also  studied by turbidity method and compared with parent drug against staphylococcus  aureus, streptococcus pyogens, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and bacillus subtilis. on the basis of these results, it is suggested that enoxacin should be coadministered with care along with h2-receptor antagonists especially in case of ranitidine, although chances of adverse reactions are rare but decrease in mic of enoxacin may result in delayed effect or require prolonged use of the drug.

TI  == the antimicrobial effect of heparin on common respiratory pathogens.
AB  == aim: the mucolytic, anticoagulative, anti-inflammatory and neo-angiogenic properties of inhaled heparin may benefit patients with burns and cystic fibrosis. we assessed the antibacterial effects of unfractionated heparin. methods: stored clinical isolates of acinetobacter baumannii (n =4), candida albicans (n = 5), haemophilus influenzae (n =5), klebsiella pneumoniae (n =4), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (n=3), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2), and streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 7) were subcultured on horse blood agar, incubated at 35 degrees c overnight, then inoculated into trypticase soy broth to a density of 1 mcfarland standard. dilutions of unfractionated heparin (containing 250- 7500 u) and 100 microl of the 1.0 mcfarland standard broth were  incubated at 35 degrees c overnight in microtitre plates and then subcultured on  horse blood agar using 1 microl standard loops. colonies (representing viable organisms) were counted. results: heparin produced dose-dependent growth inhibition of three of seven s. pneumoniae isolates (complete inhibition at 2500u dose per 200 microl) and one of five h. influenzae isolates (complete inhibition  at 7500 u dose per 200 microl), but no inhibition of other isolates. conclusions: unfractionated heparin is unlikely to have antibacterial effects because of its unpredictable inhibition of growth of common respiratory pathogens.

TI  == a model of myocardial inflammation and dysfunction in burn complicated by sepsis.
AB  == numerous studies have described that an initial injury alters immune function, disposing the injured subject to infectious complications. the mechanisms by which an initial injury primes the subject, exacerbating the responses to a second injury, remain unclear; however, inflammatory cytokines have been implicated. the development of "2-hit" models has allowed investigators to determine the role of inflammatory mediators in susceptibility to infection after injury. a high incidence rate of pneumonia after burn injury and a significant increase in postburn mortality led us to develop models of either gram-positive (streptococcus pneumoniae) or gram-negative (klebsiella pneumoniae) sepsis after  burn injury on 40% of total body surface area in rodents. in this present model,  we used adult sprague-dawley rats to evaluate cardiac function in vitro (using langendorff method) and myocardial inflammation (myocyte secretion of cytokines measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) after burn complicated by sepsis. either burn injury alone or sepsis alone produced myocardial inflammatory responses and contractile dysfunction. either gram-negative or gram-positive infection exacerbated the myocardial inflammation (increased myocyte secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1beta, and interleukin 6) above that which occurred with burn alone or with infection alone. burn complicated by sepsis exacerbated the myocardial contraction and relaxation defects observed with either sepsis alone or burn alone. inasmuch as sepsis, which occurs after a  previous injury, increases myocardial inflammation/dysfunction and mortality, the development of therapeutic strategies that either decrease inflammatory response  to the initial injury or provide cardiac support during the postinjury period may improve the outcome in injured patients who are at risk for developing sepsis.

TI  == microbial and clinical determinants of time-to-positivity in patients with bacteraemia.
AB  == time-to-positivity is useful in the diagnosis of catheter-related bacteraemia and as a predictor of an endovascular source in patients with staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia. however, this parameter has been evaluated for only a limited number of microorganisms. in the present study, time-to-positivity was recorded for 1872 episodes of significant monomicrobial bacteraemia diagnosed at a teaching hospital during a 2-year period, and the associated microbial and clinical variables were investigated. according to multivariate analysis, streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-haemolytic streptococci, escherichia coli, klebsiella, enterobacter, citrobacter and aeromonas were characterised by fast growth, with an endovascular source, shock, liver cirrhosis and neutropenia also predicting a  short time-to-positivity. for patients not receiving appropriate antibiotics, detection of gram-positive cocci in clusters within 14 h was predictive of staph. aureus; a time-to-positivity of >21 h ruled out the possibility that a gram-positive organism in chains was a beta-haemolytic streptococcus or strep. pneumoniae, and a time-to-positivity of < or =12 h meant that it was very unlikely that a gram-negative bacillus was a non-fermenter. a time-to-positivity  of < or =8 h was predictive of a non-urinary tract source in patients with e. coli bacteraemia, and detection of growth within 13 h predicted an endovascular source in those with staph. aureus bacteraemia. in conclusion, time-to-positivity depended on the microorganism, original source and clinical variables involved. although this measurement may provide some early clues concerning the microorganisms involved and the source of bacteraemia, its clinical impact remains to be defined.

TI  == aspiration pneumonias: under-diagnosed and under-treated.
AB  == purpose of review: to examine recent advancements of the epidemiology, risk factors, bacteriology, diagnostic measures, and treatment for aspiration pneumonia. recent findings: in a large prospective study, 10.3% of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization was associated with aspiration pneumonia, as opposed to 30% when patients were admitted from long-term facilities. a murine stroke model showed increased apoptosis of cell-mediated immune cells due to overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system. subsequent nasal inoculum of low-dose streptococcus pneumoniae caused severe pneumonia. another murine study showed intratracheal administration of hydrochloric acid-primed lungs more susceptible to infection with klebsiella pneumoniae. tracheal ph monitoring demonstrated acidification of trachea in 28% of patients with acute stroke deemed to be safe for oral feeding. various antimicrobial agents used to treat aspiration pneumonia have comparable success rates. however, clindamycin was the only agent that did not propagate emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. summary: aspiration pneumonia is  prevalent in community-acquired pneumonia. further studies are needed to elucidate the effects of sympathetic nervous system and aspiration pneumonitis as primers for lung infection. predicting aspiration risk is difficult and newer diagnostic tools are necessary. antimicrobials used in aspiration pneumonia have  similar success rates although the development of resistant organisms must be monitored.

TI  == exploring the antibacterial and hemolytic activity of shorter- and longer-chain beta-, alpha,beta-, and gamma-peptides, and of beta-peptides from beta2-3-aza- and beta3-2-methylidene-amino acids bearing proteinogenic side chains--a survey.
AB  == the antibacterial activities of 31 different beta-, mixed alpha/beta-, and gamma-peptides, as well as of beta-peptides derived from beta2-3-aza- and beta3-2-methylidene-amino acids were assayed against six pathogens (enterococcus  faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa), and the results were compared with literature data. the interaction of these peptides with mammalian cells, as  modeled by measuring the hemolysis of human erythrocytes, was also investigated.  in addition to those peptides designed to fold into amphiphilic helical conformations with positive charges on one face of the helix, one new peptide with hemolytic activity was detected within the sample set. moreover, it was demonstrated that neither cationic peptides used for membrane translocation (beta3-oligoarginines), nor mixed alpha/beta- or gamma-peptides with somatostatin-mimicking activities display unwanted hemolytic activity.

TI  == comparison of bactec plus blood culture media to bact/alert fa blood culture media for detection of bacterial pathogens in samples containing therapeutic levels of antibiotics.
AB  == blood culture bottles with antimicrobial removal systems are recommended for patients who develop fever while on antibiotics. this study compared the ability  of becton dickinson (sparks, md) bactec plus bottles and biomerieux (durham, nc)  bact/alert fa bottles to effectively remove vancomycin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin, oxacillin, gentamicin, and a combination of gentamicin/penicillin, thus allowing bacterial pathogens to grow.  each bottle was spiked with 10 ml of human blood, antibiotic, and strains of organisms susceptible to the antibiotic evaluated. the organisms used were type strains and clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible and resistant), streptococcus pneumoniae, a viridans streptococcus, enterococcus  faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. testing was completed in triplicate, using 10 to 100 cfu/ml of organisms with various concentrations of each antibiotic. two rounds of testing were completed per antibiotic/organism combination. bottles were mixed and loaded onto their respective instruments as per the manufacturer's instructions. antimicrobial removal was evaluated on the basis of time to detection of organism growth, for up to 5 days of incubation. overall, the bact/alert fa system recovered 25.1% of strains from test bottles and 96.9% of strains from growth control bottles (no antibiotic added), and the bactec plus system recovered 95.1% of strains from test bottles and 100% of strains from growth control bottles. both systems performed well in the detection of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of gentamicin. in the presence of ceftriaxone, neither system was able to recover streptococcus pneumoniae. the ability to remove vancomycin and cefoxitin was also determined by measuring antibiotic levels remaining in bottles after 1 h of incubation. the results demonstrated remaining levels of 72 to 90% of vancomycin and 71 to 72% of cefoxitin in the bact/alert system. for the bactec system, remaining levels were 0 to 30% of vancomycin and 0% of cefoxitin. under these simulated conditions, the bactec plus system was superior to the bact/alert fa system in recovering gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics, gentamicin/penicillin, and vancomycin.

TI  == [characteristics of war wound infection].
AB  == war wounds are the most complex type of non-targeted injuries due to uncontrolled tissue damage of varied and multifold localizations, exposing sterile body areas  to contamination with a huge amount of bacteria. wound contamination is caused by both the host microflora and exogenous agents from the environment (bullets, cloth fragments, dust, dirt, water) due to destruction of the host protective barriers. war wounds are the consequence of destructive effects of various types  of projectiles, which result in massive tissue devitalization, hematomas, and compromised circulation with tissue ischemia or anoxia. this environment is highly favorable for proliferation of bacteria and their invasion in the surrounding tissue over a relatively short period of time. war wounds are associated with a high risk of local and systemic infection. the infection will develop unless a timely combined treatment is undertaken, including surgical intervention within 6 hours of wounding and antibiotic therapy administered immediately or at latest in 3 hours of wound infliction. time is a crucial factor in this type of targeted combined treatment consisting of surgical debridement, appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy, and specific antitetanic prophylaxis. apart from exposure factors, there are a number of predisposing factors that favor the development of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infection.  these are shock, pain, blood loss, hypoxia, hematomas, type and amount of traumatized tissue, age, and comorbidity factors in the wounded. the determinants that define the spectrum of etiologic agents in contaminated war wounds are: wound type, body region involved, time interval between wounding and primary surgical treatment, climate factors, season, geographical area, hygienic conditions, and patient habits. the etiologic agents of infection include gram-positive aerobic cocci, i. e. staphylococcus spp, streptococcus spp and enterococcus spp, which belong to the physiological flora of the human skin and mucosa; gram-negative facultative aerobic rods; members of the family enterobacteriacea (escherichia coil, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae), which predominate in the physiological flora of the intestines, transitory flora of the skin and environment; gram-negative bacteria, i. e. pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter calcoaceticus -  a. baumanii complex; environmental bacteria associated with humid environment and dust; anaerobic gram-positive sporogeneous rods clostridium spp, gram-negative asporogeneous rods bacteroides spp and gram-positive anaerobic cocci; peptostreptococcus spp and peptococcus spp. the latter usually colonize the intestine, primarily the colon, and the skin, while clostridium spores are also found in the environment. early empirical antibiotic therapy is used instead of standard antibiotic prophylaxis. empirical antimicrobial therapy is administered  to prevent the development of systemic infection, gas gangrene, necrotizing infection of soft tissue, intoxication and death. the choice of antibiotics is determined by the presumed infective agents and localization of the wound. it is  used in all types of war wounds over 5-7-10 days. the characteristics of antibiotics used in war wounds are the following: broad spectrum of activity, ability to penetrate deep into the tissue, low toxicity, long half-life, easy storage and application, and cost effectiveness. the use of antibiotics is not a  substitution for surgical treatment. the expected incidence of infection, according to literature data, is 35%-40%. if the time elapsed until surgical debridement exceeds 12 hours, or the administration of antibiotics exceeds 6 hours of wound infliction, primary infection of the war wound occurs (early infection) in more than 50% of cases. the keys for the prevention of infection are prompt and thorough surgical exploration of the wound, administration of antibiotics and antitetanic prophylaxis, awareness of the probable pathogens with respect to localization of the wound, and optimal choice of antibiotics and length of their administration.

TI  == bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  == treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. it is active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. the aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella ozaenae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers  and non-producers). gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic bacteroides fragilis. ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs). killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the  first few hours of the kinetic curves against e. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (cfu) reduction in the first 2h), b. fragilis (4 log(10) cfu reduction in 4h), mssa (3 log(10) cfu reduction in 4-6h), k. ozaenae (esbl+), k. pneumoniae (esbl+ and -), e. cloacae (esbl-) in 1h and p. mirabilis (esbl+) in the first 2h. the potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of e. coli-b. fragilis and e. coli-b. fragilis-e. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of s. aureus-p. mirabilis. these results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

AB  == the objective of this paper was to establish whether patients with confirmed painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis (pbs/ic) presenting with symptoms  of uti have actual bacteriuria vs a flare of their pbs/ic symptoms. one hundred and six (n = 106) consecutive female patients (mean age 39.8 +/- 14 years) with newly diagnosed ic were identified and followed longitudinally for 24 months. at  the initial visit and at all subsequent visits, urinary specimens were obtained by sterile catheterization (bard 14fr female) and cultured for bacteria. eight patients had an initially positive urine culture, and repeat cultures 8 weeks after treatment were all negative. once sterile urine was established, the diagnosis of pbs/ic was confirmed. a pelvic pain/urgency/frequency (puf) questionnaire score was obtained from 89 patients. after the diagnosis of pbs/ic, all patients received multimodal treatment. patients were instructed to present to the office whenever they developed symptoms of uti, at which time a sterile catheter specimen was obtained and sent for culture. greater than 10(3) colonies  were considered positive. patients who did not report flares were contacted to establish whether unreported treatments were given. seventy-two patients (68%) had no uti episodes or flares. the remaining 34 patients (32%) presented with 54  flares, of which 44 were culture-negative and 10 were culture-positive. a single  flare was reported by 21 patients during the 24 months, with three positive cultures (14.3%). recurrent uti symptoms (two to four flares) were seen in a small group (n = 13) for a total of 33 flares. of these, seven had two flares each (12 negative, 2 positive), five had three flares each (12 negative, 3 positive), and one patient had four flares (two negative, two positive). therefore, within the group with recurrent symptoms, seven positive cultures were obtained for a rate of recurrent bacteriuria of 6.6% (7/106). nine of the 10 positive bacterial cultures were due to gram-negative bacteria: escherichia coli  (n = 6), proteus mirabilis (n = 1), klebsiella pneumonia (n = 1), and citrobacter sp. (n = 1). one grew streptococcus sp. there was no difference between the flare group and nonflares in regards to age or puf scores between groups. this study is the first to report on the low incidence of confirmed utis in a large group of pbs/ic patients followed longitudinally. these data suggest that only a small number of pbs/ic patients with uti symptoms have positive urine cultures (9.4%; 10/106). although the symptoms of recurrent uti are prevalent in ic patients, the incidence of confirmed recurrent utis is only 6.6%. because the flares of ic are  usually self-limiting, treatment response to antibiotics may be misleading in light of the low incidence of positive urine cultures. these data suggest that the symptom flares of ic are not usually associated with recurrent uti and, therefore, are likely due to a triggering of the other painful mechanisms involved in ic patients who are culture-negative.

TI  == [effect of dietary fish-oil on survival of experimental animals after infection with streptococcus pneumoniae or klebsiella pneumoniae.]
AB  == objective: dietary fish-oil has beneficial effect in infections and in autoimmune disorders. this effect is thought to be associated with alterations in the immune system. the gram negative organism klebsiella pneumoniae has been used as an infective agent in most studies investigating the effect of dietary fish-oil on infection. the immune response against gram positive bacteria is somewhat different to the response to gram negative oeganisms. moreover, the gram positive bacteria streptococcus pneumoniae is a very common pathogen, particularly in children. to investigate whether dietary fish-oil has different effect in infections by gram positive or gram negative bacteria, we studied the survival of mice fed with fish-oil or corn-oil supplemented diets and infected in the lungs with either klebsiella pneumoniae or streptococcus pneumoniae. materials and methods: 120 nmri mice were divided into four groups and fed diets supplemented with fish-oil (two groups, 30 mice in each group) or corn-oil (two groups, 30 mice in each group). after six weeks, the mice were infected with klebsiella pneumoniae (fish-oil group and corn-oil group) or with streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3 (fish-oil group and corn-oil group). the survival was monitored. the experiment was performed twice. results: the survival of the mice infected with klebsiella pneumoniae was significantly better in the groups receiving the fish-oil enriched diet as compared to the groups fed the corn-oil enriched diet (p=0.0001 and 0.0013). there was no difference in the survival of mice infected with streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3, receiving the fish-oil or corn-oil enriched diets (p=0.74 and p=0.15). conclusions: these results indicate that dietary fish-oil has beneficial effect on survival of mice after experimental infection with the gram negative bacteria klebsiella pneumoniae but not on experimental infections with the gram positive bacteria streptococcus pneumoniae  serotype 3.

TI  == assessment of pathogen frequency and resistance patterns among pediatric patient  isolates: report from the 2004 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program on 3 continents.
AB  == selecting empiric or directed therapy for pathogens isolated from pediatric patients can be problematic. many antimicrobial agents are not indicated for use  in pediatric patients, and regional variations of resistance mechanisms have been reported. the purpose of this study was to analyze antimicrobial resistance patterns and pathogen occurrence rates in pediatric-aged patient infections on 3  continents using data from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. a total of 3537 clinical isolates were collected from 47 medical centers in 2004. with a  protocol that dictated a sampling of 80 consecutive isolates from children (< or  =18 years of age), all samples were forwarded to a central laboratory for reference susceptibility testing. broth microdilution methods and current clinical and laboratory standards institute breakpoint criteria were used. the 15 most frequently observed pathogens accounted for 93.6% of all isolates. staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen isolated in north america (27.4%) and europe (19.0%), but escherichia coli was most common in latin america (19.3%). all streptococcus pneumoniae strains from north america and latin america were susceptible to the newer fluoroquinolones, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin. however, 2 s. pneumoniae strains from italy were resistant to gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin (> or =4 microg/ml). ribotype and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns found that these resistant pneumococci  were clonal. numerous strains of klebsiella spp. (22.5%), e. coli (4.5%), and proteus mirabilis (4.9%) exhibited phenotypic extended-spectrum beta-lactamase resistance patterns. four pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (3 from latin america and 1 from europe) were multidrug resistant, 2 p. aeruginosa isolates from turkey were resistant to polymyxin b (> or =4 microg/ml), and 8.7% of stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates from latin america were resistant to the "drug of choice", trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. physicians should be aware of pathogen occurrences that vary by children's age, geographic location, and prior antimicrobial exposure. therefore, continued surveillance will be necessary to monitor emerging antimicrobial resistance in the pediatric patient population, especially because  new agents such as the fluoroquinolones are used to a greater extent in this age  group.

TI  == pharmacodynamics of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin against streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli: simulation of human plasma concentrations after intravenous dosage in an in vitro kinetic model.
AB  == objectives: to compare in an in vitro kinetic model the pharmacodynamics of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin with a concentration-time profile simulating the human free non-protein bound concentrations of 400 mg moxifloxacin intravenous (iv) once daily, 500 mg levofloxacin iv once daily and 750 mg levofloxacin iv once daily against strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli with variable susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. methods: the strains used in the study included s. pneumoniae atcc 6306 (native strain), s. pneumoniae 19397 (double mutation; gyra and parc),  s. pneumoniae 4241 (single mutation; parc), s. aureus atcc 13709 (native strain), s. aureus mb5 (single mutation; gyra), e. coli m12 (single mutation; gyra), e. coli atcc 25922 (native strain) and k. pneumoniae atcc 29655 (native strain). the strains were exposed to moxifloxacin and levofloxacin in an in vitro kinetic model simulating the free human serum concentration-time profile of moxifloxacin  400 mg once daily, levofloxacin 500 mg once daily and 750 mg once daily. repeated samples were taken regularly during 24 h and viable counts were carried out. results and conclusions: a correlation was seen between both the area under the serum concentration curve and mic (auc/mic) and the peak concentration/mic (cmax/mic) versus area under the bactericidal killing curve (aubkc) or deltalog0-24 cfu/ml. compiling all data, an auc/mic of approximately 100 and a cmax/mic of 10 gave a maximal bactericidal effect for both levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. in accordance with the results from others, our study indicated that a lower auc/mic was needed for s. pneumoniae in comparison with the gram-negative bacteria studied. moxifloxacin yielded higher auc/mic and cmax/mic  against the investigated gram-positive bacteria in comparison with levofloxacin 500 mg once daily and 750 mg once daily.

TI  == comparisons of parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporins tested against bacterial  isolates from pediatric patients: report from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (1998-2004).
AB  == a contemporary collection of 12737 strains from pediatric patients (<18 years) isolated over a 7-year period (1998-2004) from 52 sentinel hospitals in north america was tested to determine the comparative antimicrobial potency of broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporins and selected comparator agents. most of  the strains (84.1%) were isolated from blood stream or respiratory tract infections. the rank order of the top 10 pediatric pathogens analyzed was streptococcus pneumoniae (15.5%) >haemophilus influenzae (14.6%) >staphylococcus  aureus (13.8%) >moraxella catarrhalis = coagulase-negative staphylococci (8.0%) >escherichia coli (7.8%) >pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.2%) >klebsiella spp. (4.8%) >enterococcus spp. (4.7%) > beta-hemolytic streptococci (4.4%). both cefepime and ceftriaxone (mic(90), 1 microg/ml; 93.9% and 93.7% susceptible, respectively) were highly active against s. pneumoniae. however, the s. pneumoniae strains showed reduced susceptibility to ceftazidime (56.6%), as well as penicillin (56.6%) < trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (57.1%) < erythromycin (66.2%) < tetracycline (71.4%). beta-hemolytic streptococci showed 100.0% susceptibility to penicillin, cefepime, and ceftriaxone. cefepime and ceftriaxone exhibited high activity against oxacillin (methicillin)-susceptible s. aureus, (mic(90), 4 microg/ml; 100.0% and 99.8% susceptible, respectively), whereas ceftazidime (mic(90), 16 microg/ml) was active against only 86.7% of strains. h. influenzae strains showed complete susceptibility to cefepime, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin (mic(90), < or =0.5 microg/ml; 100.0%), and 34.0% of h. influenzae and 99.2% of m. catarrhalis strains produced beta-lactamase. although the 3 cephalosporins tested (cefepime, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime) were very active (98.6-99.6% susceptible) against e. coli, cefepime (99.0% susceptible) was slightly more active than ceftriaxone and ceftazidime (96.4% and 95.1% susceptible, respectively) against klebsiella spp. cefepime was also the most active beta-lactam agent tested against enterobacter spp. (mic(90), 2 microg/ml; 99.3% susceptible), whereas the susceptibility rates of other broad-spectrum beta-lactams (ceftriaxone, ceftazidime and piperacillin-tazobactam) were significantly lower (78.4-81.5%). against p. aeruginosa, imipenem and piperacillin-tazobactam showed the highest susceptibility rates (94.4% and 93.3%, respectively), whereas imipenem and cefepime showed the lowest resistance rates (1.4% and 2.3%, respectively). our results indicate that cefepime was the most broad-spectrum cephalosporin analyzed and remains a very potent alternative for the treatment of contemporary pediatric infections in north america.

TI  == 1h nmr spectroscopy in the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae-induced urinary tract infection.
AB  == the (1)h nmr spectroscopic method is suggested and its utility is demonstrated for the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae) in urinary tract infection (uti). k. pneumoniae have the specific property of metabolizing glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-pd), acetate, ethanol and succinate. the quantity of 1,3-pd produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. other common bacteria causing uti (except for citrobacter frundii), such as escherichia coli (e. coli), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), enterobacter  aerogenes, acinetobacter baumanii, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus gp b and staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize glycerol under similar conditions. citrobacter frundii (c. frundii) also gives the same nmr results but is easily differentiated as being motile on direct microscopic examination of urine and it is not common nosocomial infectious agent in urinary  tract infection. the method provides a single-step documentation of k. pneumoniae (and c. frundii) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. out of the total 614 subjects considered, clinical diagnosis of uti was obtained in 516 cases (84%). the nmr-based screening had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 100% and a false negativity of 10% relative to the conventional quantitative culture method. in the present authors' experience, the results of nmr spectroscopy based screening show a very good correlation with the diagnosis of urinary tract infected patients.

TI  == faecal coliform bacteria in febros river (northwest portugal): temporal variation, correlation with water parameters, and species identification.
AB  == febros river water was sampled weekly, during 35 successive weeks, and analyzed for microbiological (total coliforms, faecal coliforms, faecal streptococci and enterococci) and chemical-physical (ammonia and temperature) parameters. all microbiological parameters were highly correlated with each other and with ammonia, suggesting that the simultaneous determination of all variables currently in use in the evaluation of the microbiological quality of waters is probably redundant, and could be simplified, and that ammonia should be tested as a sentinel parameter of the microbiological pollution load of febros river. from  the strains isolated from positive tubes of the faecal coliforms test (multiple tube fermentation technique) and retested in this assay, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca and klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae strains were positive, indicating that the faecal coliforms test is not totally specific for escherichia coli, and can detect other bacteria. considering that these klebsiella spp. are not necessarily of faecal origin, it was concluded that the faecal coliforms test can overestimate true faecal pollution. from the strains isolated from positive tubes of the faecal coliforms procedure, only escherichia  coli strains were clearly positive in the beta-d-glucuronidase test. all other species were negative or very weakly positive, suggesting that the assay of the beta-d-glucuronidase activity is less prone to false positives than the faecal coliforms test in the quantification of escherichia coli in environmental waters.

AB  == our medical institution does not have a bacterial culture facility, requiring outsourcing of bacterial culture tests. due to the time elapsed from the time of  specimen collection to culturing, the identification of causative bacteria in respiratory tract infections tends to be difficult. we therefore used transport medium for sputum bacteria examinations. expectorated purulent or purulent-mucous sputum specimens were collected from 32 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. we divided each of the sputum specimens into the two treatment groups: transport medium (seedswab gamma2) ndar and stad disinfection container. paired samples prepared from each patient were sent out for bacterial culture together.  the time elapsed from collection to delivery to the lab were as follows: day 0 (same day, n = 14 patients), day 1 (n = 15), day 2 (n = 2), and day 3 (n = 1). the identified causative bacteria were streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 6 patients), haemophilus influenzae (n =5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), moraxella catarrhalis (n = 2), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1), and streptococcus agalactiae (n = 1). samples prepared by each of the two methods gave similar results. the utility of transport medium for examination of general  bacteria for lower airway infection from sputum samples was not demonstrated. the rate of detection of bacteria decreased, when the transport of samples was delayed. therefore, we need to send the sputum specimens as quickly as possible.

TI  == [guidelines for treatment of pneumonia in intensive care units].
AB  == patients affected by pneumonia can be admitted in intensive care units (icus) independently by the setting where the infection has been acquired (community, hospital, long-term care facilities); even more frequently pneumonia can develop  in patients already hospitalized in icu especially in those requiring mechanical  ventilation for different reasons. within the severe community acquired pneumonia requiring admission in icu, the most frequently responsible micro-organisms are mainly represented by streptococcus pneumoniae, but also by legionella and haemophilus. pseudomonas aeruginona, anyway, cannot be excluded. the most recent  canadian and american guidelines for treatment of the above mentioned infections  suggest the use of a combination therapy with beta-lactams (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam) and a new generation macrolide or respiratory fluoroquinolone. in case of allergy to beta-lactams, the association fluoroquinolone-clindamycin should be preferred. whenever a pseudomonas etiology is suspected because of the presence of risk factors such as copd, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, previous and/or frequent therapies with antibiotics and/or steroids, the same guidelines suggest the use of an anti-pseudomonas beta-lactam (such as piperacillin/tazobactam, carbapenems, cefepime) associated with an anti-pseudomonas fluoroquinolone (high doses ciprofloxacin). an anti-pseudomonas beta-lactam plus an aminoglycoside or aminoglicosyde plus fluoroquinolone can be an alternative. early onset hospital acquired pneumonia (hap) and early onset ventilator associated pneumonia (vap) in patients without risk factors for multi-resistant etiological agents are generally sustained by s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, methicillin-susceptible staphylocccus aureus e gram negative enteric rods. these infections can be treated with one of the following antibiotics: ceftriaxone or fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin or ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) or ampicillin/sulbactam or ertapenem. late onset vap and hap in patients with risk factors for multi-resistant, by contrast, should be treated with a combination therapy: in case of defined or suspected p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae (esbl+), acinetobacter sp etiology, it is required the use of an anti-pseudomonas cephalosporin or an anti-pseudomonas carbapenem or b-lactam + beta-lactamase inhibitor associated with an anti-pseudomonas fluoroquinolone or an aminoglicoside. the possible presence of mrsa or legionella pneumophila suggests  the use of anti-gram positive antibiotics such as glycopeptides or linezolid. these quidelines confirm the role of ciprofloxacin combined with beta-lactams whenever p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae (esbl+), acinetobacter sp. etiology is suspected.

TI  == bacteremia in children at a regional hospital in trinidad.
AB  == objective: the objective of this study was to provide a trinidadian perspective on pediatric community-acquired and hospital-acquired bacteremia via the documentation of common etiologic agents, antimicrobial profiles of the isolated  pathogens, and patient outcome. methods: this was a six-year retrospective study  of children with bacteremia admitted to the pediatric wards of the san fernando general hospital, trinidad. results: seven hundred and four episodes of pediatric bacteremia were reviewed during the six-year study period. the predominant isolate was staphylococcus aureus (23.9%), followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.5%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.5%), and enterobacter spp (11.1%). the remaining isolates each accounted for less than 10% of total isolates. the mortality rate was highest for p. aeruginosa (39.4%), streptococcus pneumoniae (22.5%), and escherichia coli (19.2%). of the six cases due to neisseria meningitidis, only two survived. the overall mortality rate for the study period  was 15.1%, but varied considerably according to age. all deaths due to p. aeruginosa and e. coli occurred in neonates. almost 90% and about half of all s.  aureus were resistant to ampicillin and erythromycin, respectively; nineteen (11.3%) were methicillin-resistant. more than 95% of k. pneumoniae and more than  87% of haemophilus influenzae were resistant to ampicillin. group b streptococci  were fully susceptible to ampicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, but showed  >90% and >70% resistance to tetracycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, respectively. of the 40 strains of s. pneumoniae isolated, 10.0% had a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) >or=4 microg/ml (resistance) and 12.5% had a mic=2.0 microg/ml (intermediate resistance) to ceftriaxone, while 7.5% showed intermediate resistance (mic between 0.12 and 1 microg/ml) and 25.0% showed resistance (mic >or=2 microg/ml) to penicillin. conclusion: the bacteremia rate was found to be 8.4% among hospitalized children suspected of having sepsis and from whom a blood culture was positive. bacteremia was also associated with a high mortality rate of 15.1%. an unusually high level of bacteremia with gram-negative enteric bacteria was seen, which might indicate cross infection and reflect a breakdown in infection control measures. relatively high-level resistance of s. pneumoniae to penicillin and ceftriaxone was not seen, even though the overall prevalence of resistance to other antibiotics among other pathogens was relatively low. the drugs that showed the greatest efficacy were imipenem, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and the cephalosporins ceftazidime and ceftriaxone.

TI  == microbial pathogens of adult community-acquired pneumonia in southern estonia.
AB  == prospective analysis of the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia in 209 inpatients (mean age 56.2+/-11.2 years) was performed at the lung hospital of tartu university, estonia. majority of the patients (87.6%) had at least one significant modifying or risk factor and 30.6% had severe community-acquired pneumonia. streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, klebsiella pneumoniae, and moraxella catarrhalis were the most frequent pathogens (22.0, 12.2, 11.4, and 10.2%, respectively). combined etiology was detected in 17.2%. gram-negative pathogens prevailed over gram-positives and were significantly more frequent in patients aged > or =60 years (p=0.002) as in those with underlying diseases (p=0.01). an age of > or =60 years and previous antibacterial therapy were significant risk factors for klebsiella pneumoniae as a pathogen (p=0.005 and p=0.002, respectively). susceptibility of streptococcus pneumoniae to penicillin, erythromycin, and doxycycline was 79.5, 90.2, and 100%, respectively, whereas all penicillin-resistant isolates were cefuroxime- and ceftriaxone-susceptible. klebsiella pneumoniae was 100, 88.5, 84.2, and 81.8% susceptible to ceftazidime, gentamicin, ampicillin-sulbactam, and ciprofloxacin,  and moraxella catarrhalis was 100, 100, 100, 93.8, and 93.3% susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam, cephalexin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, and erythromycin, respectively. in conclusion, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and klebsiella pneumoniae were the major pathogens of community-acquired pneumonia in southern estonia. although gram-negatives were more prevalent, the major pathogens were favorably susceptible without a noticeable cross-resistance. nevertheless, improved surveillance studies are needed because of a pressure for  the rise in antibiotic resistance in the society.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefditoren: antimicrobial efficacy against major respiratory pathogens from asian countries.
AB  == in this study we evaluated the in vitro activities of cefditoren and 14 other comparator agents against 1025 isolates of major respiratory tract pathogens including streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, klebsiella pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus. bacterial isolates  were collected from 11 asian countries. the majority of s. pneumoniae isolates (98.8%) were susceptible to cefditoren. the mic(50) and mic(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentrations for 50% and 90% of the organisms, respectively) of s. pneumoniae were <or=0.06 microg/ml and 1 microg/ml, respectively. these values were 2-32-fold lower than those of the other cephalosporins. activity against s.  pneumoniae was observed irrespective of penicillin or macrolide resistance. cefditoren was also active against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (100% susceptible; mic(90)=1 microg/ml), h. influenzae (100% susceptible; mic(90)<or=0.016 microg/ml) and m. catarrhalis (mic(90)=0.016 microg/ml). however, the cefditoren mic(90) of k. pneumoniae reached only 64 microg/ml (81.4% susceptible), which may be due to the high incidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in asian countries. therefore, cefditoren should be considered as a therapeutic option for the treatment of respiratory tract infections in asian countries.

TI  == [antibiotic-resistance in italy: activity of the first year of the surveillance project ar-iss].
AB  == the antibiotic resistance surveillance project ar-iss, started in 2001, is based  on a network of 62 sentinel microbiological laboratories throughout the country.  the laboratories collect and transmit data to the istituto superiore di sanita on the antibiotic susceptibility of bloodstream isolates of 7 species: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis/faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca ed escherichia coli. they also send selected bacterial strains for further characterization. results of the first year of surveillance are presented and are compared with data from the previous study earss-italia and from other european countries. oxacillin resistance in s. aureus appears to be stable, however, it remains one of the highest in europe (41,5%). no strain with intermediate susceptibility or resistance to vancomycin has been isolated. in s. pneumoniae, the level of penicillin resistance is moderate (10,8%), but macrolide resistance has increased greatly (37,6% versus 28,6% of the previous study), following a tendency common to several european countries. unexpectedly, vancomycin resistance in e. faecium was found to be 18%, the highest in europe. presumptive esbl production in gram-negative organisms can be  estimated at 20% in klebsiella and 1% in e. coli. ampicillin and ciprofloxacin resistance in e. coli (respectively 50% and 18%) are among the highest in europe. in conclusion, the rate of antibiotic resistance in the species studied is worrisome and requires continuing monitoring. although some activities of ar-iss  need improvements, the surveillance has the potentiality to produce relevant and  representative data about antibiotic resistance in italy that can be used for comparison at the european level.

TI  == leptin and host defense against gram-positive and gram-negative pneumonia in mice.
AB  == leptin is a pleiotrophic protein mainly produced by adipocytes that has been implicated as a link between nutritional status and immune function. severe bacterial infection is associated with elevated plasma levels of leptin. to determine the role of leptin in the host response to bacterial pneumonia leptin deficient ob/ob mice and normal wild-type (wt) mice were intranasally infected with different doses of the gram-positive pathogen streptococcus (s.) pneumoniae  or the gram-negative bacterium klebsiella (k.) pneumoniae. after infection with lower doses of either pathogen ob/ob mice displayed lower pulmonary levels of proinflammatory cytokines, in particular tumor necrosis factor-alpha and chemokines. however, after infection with a higher dose of s. pneumoniae or k. pneumoniae the lung concentrations of these inflammatory mediators did not differ between ob/ob and wt mice. in addition, the extent and severity of lung inflammation, as assessed by semi-quantitative histopathology scores, were similar in both mouse strains. finally, leptin deficiency did not impact on the bacterial outgrowth in the lungs during either gram-positive or gram-negative pneumonia irrespective of the infective dose. these data suggest that although leptin may play a modest role in the regulation of inflammation during bacterial  pneumonia, it does not contribute to host defense mechanisms that act to limit the outgrowth of s. pneumoniae or k. pneumoniae in the lower airways.

TI  == effect of aspiration pneumonia-induced sepsis on post-burn cardiac inflammation and function in mice.
AB  == introduction: numerous studies have found that burn injury alters immune function, predisposing the subject to infectious complications. we developed a mouse model of burn injury complicated by either gram-positive or gram-negative infection and hypothesized that post-burn infection would exacerbate the myocardial cytokine responses and contractile dysfunction characteristic of either sepsis alone or burn alone. methods: adult c57 bl6 mice were given burn injury over 40% of the total body surface area and conventional fluid resuscitation (lactated ringer's solution, 4 ml/kg/% burn) followed on day 7 by intratracheal administration of 1 x 10(5) cfu of either streptococcus pneumoniae  or klebsiella pneumoniae or saline. mice received fluid resuscitation (2 ml of lactated ringer's intraperitoneally) again after bacterial challenge. cardiomyocyte cytokine secretion and the contractile function of isolated hearts  (langendorff perfusion) were examined in vitro 24 h after bacterial challenge. results: infectious challenge seven days after burn injury exaggerated the inflammatory cytokine responses over those observed with either burn alone or gram-positive or gram-negative infection alone (tumor necrosis factor-alpha: sham, 72 +/- 9 pg/ml; burn alone, 176 +/- 6 pg/ml, klebsiella pneumoniae alone, 337 +/- 8 pg/ml; streptococcus pneumoniae alone, 184 +/- 2 pg/ml; burn + klebsiella, 476 +/- 14 pg/ml; burn + streptococcus, 351 +/- 6 pg/ml). myocardial  contractile depression was evident in the burn alone, infection alone, and burn plus infection groups, regardless of the organism selected to produce pneumonia-related sepsis. conclusions: gram-negative or gram-positive infection exacerbated the myocardial inflammation seen with burn alone or infection alone.  the availability of a mouse model of burn injury complicated by pneumonia-related sepsis will allow use of genetically engineered mice to examine further the mechanisms by which burn injury increases susceptibility to infection.

TI  == [using antibiotics in case of influenza].
AB  == acute respiratory bacterial infection is the most common complication of influenza and a leading cause for excess rate of outpatient visits, hospitalization, and death (pneumonia). influenza promotes bacterial infection as stated by epidemiologic evidence of temporal association between outbreaks or peaks of both influenza and bacterial pneumonia. the bacteria involved are streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus. however, gram-negative rods, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, anaerobes and  methicillin resistant s. aureus may be involved in institutionalized elderly patients. various studies confirm that antibiotics are over-prescribed in patients with influenza or influenza like illness, even in the absence of bacterial infection signs, and in patients without comorbidity. no data has proven the benefice of antibiotic prescription in influenza-infected patients without bacterial infection. neuraminidase inhibitors may be of interest for the  management of influenza infected patients, because they can decrease the risk of  bacterial complications and the use of antibiotics.

TI  == comparative study of bacteriology in recurrent tonsillitis among children and adults.
AB  == introduction: diagnosis and treatment of acute tonsillitis are one of the most common problems seen at an otorhinolaryngology clinic in both adult and paediatric populations. much has been written about bacteriology of recurrent tonsillitis but it remains a controversial topic. despite the fact that tonsillitis is so common, consensus seems to be lacking as to the main causative  organism and the differences between children and adults. the tonsillar core bacteriology of 233 patients with recurrent tonsillitis who underwent tonsillectomy from january 2000 to june 2003 is presented. methods: the patient population was divided into two groups, namely: the paediatric group and the adult group. 132 patients, whose age was more than 12 years, were in the adult group. 101 patients aged between two and 12 years, were in the paediatric group.  the bacteriology of the children and adults were tabulated according to their species, and were compared. results: 138 patients grew single pathogenic bacteria in their tonsillar core culture, 52 grew two different pathogenic bacteria, and the rest (43) grew normal bacterial flora. staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly-isolated bacterium and accounted for 40.9 percent of the total cultures  isolated; its prevalence was the same in the adults and children. beta-haemolytic streptococcus was isolated in 23 percent of subjects, and was predominantly from  group a (streptococcus pyogens). group a beta-haemolytic streptococci was more prevalent in children. pseudomonas aeruginosa, which rarely cause pathogenicity in tonsils, was cultured from nine (3.8 percent) of our study subjects. conclusion: this study showed that staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogenic bacteria cultured both in adults and children. klebsiella pneumonia, streptococcus pneumonia, escherichia coli and enterobacter are more prevalent in  adults. haemophilus influenza and streptococcus pyogens are more prevalent in children. pseudomonas aeruginosa is not a rare causative organism in recurrent tonsillitis. since the mechanism of activation of infection in recurrent tonsillitis is unknown, knowing the bacteriology does not help us to treat the disease. however, it may be a stepping stone to eventually understanding whether  the bacteria play a role in reactivating recurrent infections. from previous and  current studies, there is no relationship between bacteriology and recurrent infections.

TI  == neutropenia induced in outbred mice by a simplified low-dose cyclophosphamide regimen: characterization and applicability to diverse experimental models of infectious diseases.
AB  == background: for its low cost and ease of handling, the mouse remains the preferred experimental animal for preclinical tests. to avoid the interaction of  the animal immune system, in vivo antibiotic pharmacodynamic studies often employ cyclophosphamide (cpm) to induce neutropenia. although high doses (350-450 mg/kg) are still used and their effects on mouse leukocytes have been described, a lower dose (250 mg/kg) is widely preferred today, but the characteristics and applicability of this approach in outbred mice have not been determined. methods: fifteen female icr mice were injected intraperitoneally with 150 and 100 mg/kg of cpm on days 1 and 4, respectively. blood samples (approximately 160 microl) were  drawn from the retro-orbital sinus of each mouse on days 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 11. leukocytes were counted manually and the number of granulocytes was based on microscopic examination of wright-stained smears. the impact of neutropenia induced by this method was then determined with a variety of pathogens in three different murine models of human infections: pneumonia (klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus), meningoencephalitis (s. pneumoniae), and the thigh model (s. aureus, escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis). results: the basal count of leukocytes was within the normal range for outbred mice. on day 4, there was an 84% reduction in total white blood cells, and by day 5 the leukopenia reached its nadir (370 +/- 84 cells/mm3). profound neutropenia (< or =10 neutrophils/mm3) was demonstrated at day 4 and persisted through days 5 and 6. lymphocytes and monocytes had a 92% and 96% decline between days 1 and 5, respectively. leukocytes recovered completely by day 11. mice immunosupressed under this protocol displayed clinical and microbiological patterns of progressive and lethal infectious diseases after inoculation in different organs with diverse human pathogens. conclusion: a cpm total dose of 250 mg/kg is sufficient to induce profound and sustained neutropenia (<10 neutrophils/mm3) at least during 3 days in outbred mice, is simpler than previously described methods, and allows successful induction of infection in a variety of experimental models.

TI  == endoscopically guided aerobic cultures in postsurgical patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.
AB  == background: there is considerable amount of debate in the literature regarding the microbial flora of normal, acutely infected, and chronically infected paranasal sinuses. few studies have specifically looked at the microbial flora of healthy and infected sinus cavities after functional endoscopic sinus surgery. methods: one hundred thirty-four cultures were studied. all cultures were obtained using a standard technique. the nasal cavities were decongested and anesthetized, and nasal endoscopy was performed. when purulent secretions were identified, specimens of purulent secretions were obtained for incubation. sensitivities were tested according to microorganisms identified. empiric therapy generally consisted of afluoroquinolone, amoxicillin/clavulanate, or a later-generation cephalosporin, and adjustment in individual instances when appropriate. results: twelve cultures showed no growth, 86 grew a single microorganism, and 35 grew two or more microorganisms for a total of 151 microorganisms identified. the most common microorganisms were staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. other organisms that were cultured <5% of the time included streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenza, moraxella catarrhalis, serratia liquefaciens, stenotrophomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia, alcaligenes, fusobacterium, escherichia coli, diphtheroids, acinetobacter species, klebsiella species, skin flora, and mixed gram-negative and gram-positives. conclusion: endoscopically guided aerobic cultures in postsurgical patients with acute exacerbations of chronic rhinosinusitis most commonly grew s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and pseudomonal species. these cultures altered antibiotic treatment management decisions in a significant number of cases regardless of patients' clinical characteristics or history of previous culture.

TI  == surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of invasive pathogens: the estonian experience.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to evaluate the needs for surveillance of invasive gram-negative pathogens in estonia. the antimicrobial susceptibility data of invasive isolates of acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella spp, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci were collected in accordance with earss (european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system) protocols. despite the higher rate of gram positive pathogens, their resistance to antimicrobials was low in contrast to the elevated resistance established for gram negative pathogens. the higher resistance to antimicrobials was particularly associated with a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa. also, the proportion of extended spectrum betalactamase (esbl)-producing strains was 23% among klebsiella spp. and 3.6% among e. coli. the inclusion of invasive gram negative pathogens in antimicrobial resistance surveillance provides useful information concerning local pathogen susceptibility, as well as for the empirical treatment of suspected infections.

TI  == pharmacodynamics of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin simulating human serum and lung concentrations.
AB  == fluoroquinolones are known to penetrate well into the infectious foci such as lung mucosa, epithelial lining fluid and alveolar macrophages achieving higher target site concentrations than the corresponding serum levels. in order to integrate the in vitro antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin, their bactericidal efficacy was assessed by simulating human serum and lung tissue concentrations using streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae as indicator organisms. the bacteria were exposed to fluctuating moxifloxacin and levofloxacin concentrations simulating the drug levels in serum, lung mucosa, epithelial lining fluid and alveolar macrophages. the following parameters were deduced from the kill curves: area under the bactericidal kill curve normalized to the initial inoculum (aubkc norm), the time needed to reduce the inoculum by 3 log(10) titers, and the initial bactericidal activity. in general, all these three parameters were for all the bacterial isolates having been exposed to moxifloxacin concentration dependent. in contrast, beyond a levofloxacin concentration of optimal bactericidal effect, higher drug concentrations did not  further augment the bactericidal activity of levofloxacin. these data demonstrate that not all fluoroquinolones share the same pharmacodynamic targets needed to maximize their antibacterial effect.

TI  == stroke-associated pneumonia: microbiological data and outcome.
AB  == introduction: pneumonia is a common complication after acute stroke. it affects the outcome adversely. however, data regarding microbiology of stroke-associated  pneumonia and its effect on outcome is scarce. methods: stroke-associated pneumonia was identified through chart review of all icd-9 identified adult stroke patients admitted to our hospital over a period of four years (1998-2001). the demographical, laboratory, radiological, microbiological data and outcome of  patients with stroke-associated pneumonia were recorded and analysed. results: 443 patients with stroke were admitted over the four-year period and 102 (23 percent) had stroke-associated pneumonia. their ages range from 28 to 100 (mean 64+/-14) years. 69 (68 percent) were men. median length of stay was nine days compared to four days for all stroke patients. 68 (67 percent) patients manifested pneumonia within 48 hours and 34 (33 percent) after 48 hours of admission. yield of tracheal aspirate cultures was 38 percent and that of chest radiographs was 25 percent. pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus were the most common organisms (12 percent each) followed by streptococcus pneumoniae  and klebsiella pneumoniae (4 percent each). patients with infiltrates on chest radiographs were more likely to have positive tracheal aspirate cultures (p-value is 0.003). 35 patients (34 percent) expired during hospital stay. positive chest  radiographs and tracheal aspirates were independent predictors of prolonged hospital stay (p-value is less than 0.005). conclusion: pneumonia is a common medical complication of stroke. it is associated with a high mortality and prolongs the hospital stay. the yield of chest radiographs and tracheal aspirates is low. however, these are independent predictors of prolonged hospital stay. pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus are most common organisms in stroke-associated pneumonia.

TI  == acute bacterial meningitis in qatar.
AB  == objective: to study the changes in the epidemiology, clinical and bacteriological profiles of bacterial meningitis in the era of the haemophilus influenzae type b  (hib)vaccine and pneumococcus resistance. methods: this is a retrospective study  of children aged <12 years admitted to the hamad medical corporation, qatar between january 1998 through december 2002 with positive cerebrospinal fluid culture. results: we described 64 patients with culture proven bacterial meningitis. in infants <3 months (n=29 [45%]), the most common organism was group b streptococcus (gbs) (20%). children >3 months (n=35 [55%]); hib (25%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (stp) (20%) were the most common organisms before introduction of hib vaccination. a significant drop of hib infections were noticed after introduction of the vaccine. fever, neck stiffness, seizure, vomiting, and bulging fontanel were the most frequent presenting features. group  b streptococcus were sensitive to ampicillin and cefotaxime with no resistance detected. forty percent of stp isolates were resistant to penicillin and 12% were resistant to ceftriaxone. fifty percent of hib were resistant to ampicillin; while none of hib were resistant to ceftriaxone. no case of listeria monocytogenes meningitis was diagnosed. morbidity was 28%, and one patient expired (2%) after klebsiella pneumoniae meningitis. streptococcus pneumoniae was associated with the highest morbidity (62%) while hib had zero morbidity in our patients. conclusion: bacterial meningitis is a serious illness with a significant morbidity and mortality. haemophilus influenzae type b infection decreased which indicated an effective vaccination. as there is 12% bacterial resistance of stp reported against ceftriaxone; we recommend cefotaxime for infants <3 months while ceftriaxone plus vancomycin as empiric therapy for older  patients with community acquired bacterial meningitis. a pneumococcal vaccination may further decrease the incidence of meningitis in our community. a continuos surveillance to detect changes in the microbiology of organisms causing bacterial meningitis or their sensitivity in our community is essential to update these recommendations.

TI  == detection of diverse bacterial signatures in atherosclerotic lesions of patients  with coronary heart disease.
AB  == background: bacterial infection has been discussed as a potential etiologic factor in the pathophysiology of coronary heart disease (chd). this study analyzes molecular phylogenies to systematically explore the presence, frequency, and diversity of bacteria in atherosclerotic lesions in patients with chd. methods and results: we investigated 16s rdna signatures in atherosclerotic tissue obtained through catheter-based atherectomy of 38 patients with chd, control material from postmortem patients (n=15), and heart-beating organ donors  (n=11) using clone libraries, denaturating gradient gel analysis, and fluorescence in situ hybridization. bacterial dna was found in all chd patients by conserved pcr but not in control material or in any of the normal/unaffected coronary arteries. presence of bacteria in atherosclerotic lesions was confirmed  by fluorescence in situ hybridization. a high overall bacterial diversity of >50  different species, among them staphylococcus species, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella pneumoniae, and streptococcus species, was demonstrated in >1500 clones from a combined library and confirmed by denaturating gradient gel analysis. mean bacterial diversity in atheromas was high, with a score of 12.33+/-3.81 (range, 5 to 22). a specific pcr detected chlamydia species in 51.5% of chd patients. conclusions: detection of a broad variety of molecular signatures in all chd specimens suggests that diverse bacterial colonization may  be more important than a single pathogen. our observation does not allow us to conclude that bacteria are the causative agent in the etiopathogenesis of chd. however, bacterial agents could have secondarily colonized atheromatous lesions and could act as an additional factor accelerating disease progression.

AB  == background: alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against cd52, a cell surface antigen expressed on b and t lymphocytes, monocytes and nk cells.  its use results in a profound decrease in cd4 positive t lymphocytes. alemtuzumab is used as induction immunosuppression and therapy for rejection in organ transplant recipients in some centers. we followed a cohort of 449 consecutive transplant recipients who received alemtuzumab to determine the occurrence of bloodstream infections, particularly those previously associated with decrease in cd4 positive t lymphocytes. patients and methods: fifteen percent (69/449) patients had at least one episode of bloodstream infection. however, no patient had bacteremia with streptococcus pneumoniae, listeria monocytogenes, non-typhoidal salmonella or mycobacterium avium complex. fungaemia was rare, occurring in 1.5% of patients. the most common organisms isolated from the blood  were staphylococcus aureus (21 episodes), coagulase negative staphylococcus (14 episodes), klebsiella pneumoniae (12 episodes), enterococcus faecium (11 episodes), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 episodes), enterococcus faecalis (9 episodes) and escherichia coli (7 episodes). discussion: we conclude that although alemtuzumab use is associated with profound cd4 positive t lymphocyte depletion, alemtuzumab does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of bloodstream infection with pathogens typically seen in other disorders of cd4 cell depletion, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

TI  == a prospective etiologic study of community-acquired pneumonia in taiwan.
AB  == background and purpose: the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (cap) is complicated by the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance and the tendency to rely on empirical therapy. this study investigated the etiologic agents of adult  cap in taiwan and the susceptibility of streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from these patients. methods: a collaborative group was established in the emergency department to conduct a prospective study of the etiology of adult cap. the etiologic agent was determined by a combination of microscopic, culture, serologic and antigen detection methods. pneumococcal susceptibility testing was  performed to determine the extent of penicillin resistance. results: a total of 100 consecutive cases of mild to moderate adult cap prior to the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic were enrolled. the etiologic agent was determined in 72% of cases. the 5 most common causative pathogens were s. pneumoniae (26%),  mycoplasma pneumoniae (20%), chlamydia pneumoniae (13%), haemophilus influenzae (9%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (5%). atypical pathogens accounted for 40% of cap. bacteremic pneumonia was diagnosed in 6.2% of cases. co-infections with 2 or more pathogens were found in 16% of the cases. among the 20 isolates of s. pneumoniae, 85% (17/20) were susceptible to penicillin, 3 (15%) were intermediate, and none were resistant to penicillin. conclusion: s. pneumoniae, m. pneumoniae and c. pneumoniae were the 3 leading causes of mild to moderate cap in taiwan. this study indicates that penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae play a very limited role in this condition in adults.

TI  == spectrum and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of bacterial isolates from conjunctival swabs.
AB  == conjunctivitis is the most common disease of conjunctiva which occurs by exogenous or endogenous source. bacterial conjunctivitis is the most common type  of this infection for which emperical treatment is started without knowing the etiological agents because prior cultures are generally not taken. we conducted this survey to study the etiological agents of conjunctivitis in a total of 6763  swabs obtained over a period of four years (2001 to 2004). the prevalence of bacterial conjunctivitis was found to be 20.4% with a predominance of staphylococcus aureus (87.2%) followed by streptococcus pneumoniae (4.7%) and gram negative rods (e.coli + klebsiella spp. + pseudomonas spp.) in 8.1% swabs. for s. aureus, amikacin showed maximum sensitivity (73.2%) while for s. pneumoniae, cefotaxime (90.6%) and cefazolin (89%) were found to be highly sensitive drugs. for gram negative rods, ceftazidime (74.1%) and cefotaxime (67%) were found to be preferred options. thus it is concluded that bacterial conjunctivitis in our hospital is predominated by s. aureus. the bacterial isolates obtained from conjunctiva have not yet attained a high level of antibiotic resistance and hence averts the need to unnecessarily start new/latest generations of antibiotic eyedrops or antibiotic combination which may lead to acquisition of resistance by these bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of native and synthetic surfactant protein b peptides.
AB  == surfactant protein b (sp-b) is secreted into the airspaces with surfactant phospholipids where it reduces surface tension and prevents alveolar collapse at  end expiration. sp-b is a member of the saposin-like family of proteins, several  of which have antimicrobial properties. sp-b lyses negatively charged liposomes and was previously reported to inhibit the growth of escherichia coli in vitro; however, a separate study indicated that elevated levels of sp-b in the airspaces of transgenic mice did not confer resistance to infection. the goal of this study was to assess the antimicrobial properties of native sp-b and synthetic peptides  derived from the native peptide. native sp-b aggregated and killed clinical isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and group b streptococcus by increasing membrane permeability; however, sp-b also lysed rbc, indicating that the membranolytic activity was not selective for bacteria. both the antimicrobial and hemolytic activities of native sp-b were inhibited by surfactant phospholipids, suggesting that endogenous sp-b may not play a significant role in alveolar host defense. synthetic peptides derived from native sp-b were effective at killing both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria at low peptide concentrations (0.15-5.0 microm). the sp-b derivatives selectively lysed bacterial membranes and were more resistant to inhibition by phospholipids; furthermore, helix 1 (residues 7-22) retained significant antimicrobial activity in the presence of native surfactant. these results suggest that the role of endogenous sp-b in host defense may be limited; however, synthetic peptides derived from sp-b may be useful in the treatment of bacterial  pneumonias.

TI  == pharmacologic characteristics of prulifloxacin.
AB  == prulifloxacin, the prodrug of ulifloxacin, is a broad-spectrum oral fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent. after absorption, prulifloxacin is metabolized by esterases to ulifloxacin. the drug has a long elimination half-life, allowing once-daily administration. in vitro, ulifloxacin is generally more active than other fluoroquinolones against a variety of clinical isolates of gram-negative bacteria, including community and nosocomial isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus, providencia and morganella spp., moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa. gram-positive organisms, including methicillin- or oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus spp. and streptococcus pneumoniae, are susceptible to ulifloxacin. in well-designed clinical trials, prulifloxacin showed good clinical and bacteriological efficacy (similar to that of ciprofloxacin) and was generally well tolerated, demonstrating a similar tolerability profile to that of ciprofloxacin. in conclusion, the in vitro inhibitory and bactericidal activities exhibited by ulifloxacin and the favorable characteristics shown by its prodrug (prulifloxacin) in clinical trials, particularly indicate this drug for the treatment of lung and urinary infections.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of doripenem (s-4661): a global surveillance report (2003).
AB  == the spectrum of activity and potency of doripenem, a broad-spectrum parenteral carbapenem currently in clinical development, was evaluated using 16 008 clinical bacterial isolates collected as part of an international surveillance project during 2003. using reference broth microdilution methods, doripenem was found to  be highly active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (2705 and 297 isolates, respectively; mic90s 0.06 mg/l), with a potency greater than that of other carbapenem antibiotics. against enterococci (1474 isolates), with the exception of enterococcus faecium,  doripenem displayed modest activity (mic50 4). doripenem was among the most potent agents tested against streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci and beta-haemolytic streptococci (885, 140 and 397 isolates; mic(90)s 0.5, 0.5 and 0.03 mg/l, respectively). for enterobacteriaceae (> 6200 isolates), doripenem was four- to 32-fold more active than imipenem against wild-type isolates (mic90s 0.03-0.5 mg/l). mic90s for confirmed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae (121 and 155  isolates; 0.06 and 0.12 mg/l, respectively) were two-fold higher than for wild-type isolates. doripenem was also active against citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp. and serratia spp. (mic90s 0.06-0.25 mg/l), including ceftazidime-resistant isolates. doripenem and meropenem were the most active agents among all beta-lactams against pseudomonas aeruginosa (829 isolates; mic50/90s 0.5/8 and 0.5/16 mg/l, respectively), whereas doripenem and imipenem were the most active agents against acinetobacter spp. (155 isolates; mic50/90s 0.5/4 and <or= 0.5/2 mg/l, respectively). doripenem was slightly more potent (mic50 2 mg/l) than ertapenem and imipenem (mic50 4 mg/l), and had a potency similar to that of meropenem (mic50 2 mg/l), against burkholderia cepacia (20 isolates). both haemophilus influenzae (1824 isolates) and moraxella catarrhalis  (108 isolates), including beta-lactamase-positive isolates, were susceptible to doripenem (mic90s 0.25 and 0.03 mg/l, respectively). doripenem displays the favourable characteristics of other carbapenems, and appears to offer certain advantages in terms of potency, spectrum and beta-lactamase stability when compared with some carbapenems used currently to treat nosocomial infections.

TI  == changing face of septicaemia and increasing drug resistance in blood isolates.
AB  == in a retrospective study conducted between january, 2000 and december 2000, 7157  adults and children were studied. amongst these, 1071 patients had positive blood cultures. of these, 575 (53.6%) cases were community acquired septicaemia and 486 (46.4%) cases had developed septicaemia of nosocomial origin. gram negative aerobes accounted for 708 (66.1%) isolates. amongst them, klebsiella pneumoniae predominated (23%), followed by escherichia coli (14%). acinetobacter spp. emerged as the next common pathogen (9%), followed by salmonella typhi (5.4%). staphylococcus aureus (9%) and coagulase negative staphylococci (9%) were the most common gram positive isolates followed by enterococcus faecalis (4.7%). antibiotic susceptibility of all these isolates was performed by the modified stokes' method. both klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli showed alarmingly high resistance to all groups of antibiotics with 70-80% resistance to amoxicillin and cephalexin. minimum resistance was observed against cefotaxime (23%) and ciprofloxacin (12%). majority of enterococcus faecalis were multidrug resistant. streptococcus pneumoniae exhibited 26% resistance to penicillin. thus, the study clearly highlights the rising level of drug resistance amongst the bacterial isolates from blood and hence the need to update and formulate newer drug policies.

TI  == a study of the role of multiple site blood cultures in the evaluation of neonatal sepsis.
AB  == background: the optimal number of blood cultures needed to document sepsis in an  ill neonate has undergone little critical evaluation. multiple site cultures may  improve pathogen detection if intermittent bacteremia occurs, or if a low density of bacteria is present in the blood. we hypothesized, however, that bacterial clearance is slower and bacteremia more continuous in septic neonates, so that a  single site blood culture should be sufficient to accurately document true septicemia. objective: to determine the need for multiple site blood cultures in  the evaluation of neonates for sepsis. design/methods: clinical data were prospectively collected for 216 neonates who had 269 pairs of blood cultures taken from two different peripheral sites for the evaluation of possible sepsis.  a minimum of 1 ml of blood was obtained from the two peripheral sites within 15-30 min of each other. based on prior retrospective data, we determined that 203 infants would need to have two site blood cultures to demonstrate a significant improvement in pathogen detection at an alpha of 0.05 and a beta of 0.20 (80%) power. results: a total of 186 culture pairs were taken for evaluation of early-onset sepsis in 186 neonates, while 83 pairs were drawn for evaluation of late-onset sepsis in 43 neonates. in all, 21 neonates from the late-onset group were evaluated more than once, and 12 neonates were evaluated for both early- and late-onset sepsis. in all, 20 (9.2%) of 216 neonates had 22 episodes of culture-proven sepsis at a median age of 18 days. all neonates with positive cultures had the same organism with a similar sensitivity pattern obtained from the two different peripheral sites. the other 196 study neonates had negative blood cultures from both sites. the single episode of early-onset sepsis was caused by listeria monocytogenes, while all remaining episodes were late-onset with the following organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis (7), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (3), combined mrsa and candida albicans (2), candida albicans alone (2), late-onset group b beta-hemolytic streptococcus (gbs) (2), klebsiella pneumoniae (2), enterococcus fecalis (1), escherichia coli (1), and serratia marcescens (1). since no infant grew organisms from only one of the two sites, the data indicate that the diagnosis of sepsis would have been made correctly in all infants with a single site culture. conclusions: two site blood cultures for the initial evaluation of neonatal sepsis do not have a better yield in pathogen detection. sepsis in neonates can be detected with no loss of accuracy with a single site blood culture with blood  volume of>or=1 ml.

TI  == bacteriophage therapy: a revitalized therapy against bacterial infectious diseases.
AB  == bacteriophage (phage) therapy involves using phages or their products as bioagents for the treatment or prophylaxis of bacterial infectious diseases. much evidence in support of the effectiveness of phage therapy against bacterial infectious diseases has accumulated since 1980 from animal model studies conducted in western countries. reports indicate that appropriate administration  of living phages can be used to treat lethal infectious diseases caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, vibrio vulnificus, and salmonella spp., and gram-positive bacteria, such as enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus. the phage display system and genetically modified nonreplicating phages are also effective for treatment of helicobacter pylori and p. aeruginosa, respectively. in addition to phage particles per se, purified phage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolase (lysin) is also reported to be effective for the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases caused by gram-positive bacteria such  as streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, bacillus anthracis, and group b streptococci. all phage lysins that have been studied to date exhibit immediate and strong bacteriolytic activity when applied exogenously. furthermore, phage-coded inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis (protein antibiotics), search methods for novel antibacterial agents using phage genome informatics, and vaccines utilizing phages or their products are being developed. phage therapy will compensate for unavoidable complications of chemotherapy such as the appearance of multidrug resistance or substituted microbism.

AB  == rationale: leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone that declines dramatically during fasting and plays a pivotal role in the neuroendocrine response to starvation. previously, we employed leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice to identify an  important role for leptin in the host defense against klebsiella pneumonia. objectives: to assess the effects of fasting on the innate immune response against pneumococcal pneumonia and to determine the effects of maintaining circulating leptin levels on host defense in fasted mice. methods: c57bl/6 mice were either fed ad libitum or fasted for 48 h and given an intraperitoneal injection of saline or recombinant leptin (1 microg/g of body weight) twice daily for 48 h before bacterial challenge. mice were challenged with 10(5) cfu of streptococcus pneumoniae via the intranasal route. measurements and main results: lung homogenate s. pneumoniae burden was nearly 20-fold greater in the fasted as  compared with fed mice. the impairment in bacterial clearance observed in fasted  animals was associated with reduced bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophil counts and  interleukin-6 and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 levels. alveolar macrophages  from fasted animals also exhibited defective phagocytosis and killing of s. pneumoniae and reduced calcium-ionophore-stimulated leukotriene b(4) synthesis in vitro. in contrast, the provision of exogenous leptin to fasted animals restored  bacterial clearance, bronchoalveolar lavage levels of neutrophils and cytokines,  alveolar macrophage bacterial killing, and leukotriene b(4) synthesis. conclusions: these results suggest that reduced leptin levels substantially contribute to the suppression of pulmonary antibacterial host defense during starvation and that administration of this adipokine may be of therapeutic benefit clinically.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sm-216601, a new broad-spectrum  parenteral carbapenem.
AB  == sm-216601 is a novel parenteral 1beta-methylcarbapenem. in agar dilution susceptibility testing, the mic of sm-216601 for 90% of the methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) strains tested (mic(90)) was 2 microg/ml, which was  comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid. sm-216601 was also very potent against enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant strains (mic(90) = 8 microg/ml). sm-216601 exhibited potent activity against penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, moraxella  catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, with mic(90)s of less than 0.5 microg/ml, and intermediate activity against citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa. the therapeutic efficacy of sm-216601 against experimentally induced  infections in mice caused by s. aureus, e. faecium, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa reflected its in vitro activity and plasma level. thus, sm-216601 is a promising  candidate for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in the hospital setting: impact, trends, and infection control measures.
AB  == the growing threat posed by antibiotic-resistant pathogens is a major challenge for infectious disease practitioners and public health officials. in recent years, the prevalence of resistance among key bacterial pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus sp, has increased at an alarming rate. the impact of antimicrobial resistance is manifold and can ultimately lead to treatment failure and increased morbidity and mortality. to control the spread of resistance and subsequent impact, a multifaceted approach is warranted. awareness and surveillance of antimicrobial resistance, prudent use of antibiotics, and compliance with infection control techniques may help contain the emergence and spread of resistant organisms.

TI  == [susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2003)].
AB  == from october 2003 to september 2004, we collected the specimen from 399 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 12 institutions in japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and patients' characteristics. of 474 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 469 strains were examined. the breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: staphylococcus aureus 76, streptococcus pneumoniae 81, haemophilus influenzae 84, pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 56, p. aeruginosa (mucoid) 11, klebsiella pneumoniae 36, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis 24, etc. of 76 s. aureus strains, those with 2 microg/ml or less of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-susceptible s. aureus: mssa) and those with 4 microg/ml or more of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) were both 38 strains (50.0%). against mssa, imipenem had the most potent antibacterial activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/ml. against mrsa, vancomycin showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/ml. arbekacin also showed the potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 4 microg/ml. carbapenems showed the most potent  activities against s. pneumoniae and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.125-0.5 microg/ml. cefozopran (czop) also had a preferable activity (mic90:2 microg/ ml) and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 4 microg/ml. in contrast, there were high-resistant strains (mic: 128 microg/ml or more) for cefaclor (11.1%), erythromycin (43.2%), and clindamycin (40.7%). against h. influenzae, levofloxacin showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of 83 of all the strains (98.8%) at 0.063 microg/ml. tobramycin showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) and its mic90  was 2 microg/ml. the activity of czop also was preferable and its mic90 was 4 microg/ml for the mucoid-type and 8 microg/ml for the non-mucoid type. czop was the most potent activities against k. pneumoniae and inhibited the growth of all  the strains at 0.125 microg/ml. also, all the agents generally showed potent activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis and the mic90 of them were 4 microg/ml or  less. the approximately half the number (54.1%) of the patients with respiratory  infection were aged 70 years or older. bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for 46.1% and 30.6% of all the respiratory infection, respectively. the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were s. aureus (18.6%) and h. influenzae (18.1%). in contrast, s. aureus (16.9%) and s. pneumoniae (14.9%) were frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients were s. pneumoniae (20.6%) and h. influenzae (21.5%). the bacteria relatively frequently isolated from the patients treated with cephems or macrolides were p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus was relatively frequently isolated from the patients treated with quinolones.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of ceftriaxone against various clinical strains isolated  in 2004].
AB  == the susceptibility of clinical strains isolated from patients with infection to ceftriaxone (ctrx) and injectable beta-lactam antibiotics was determined in japanese medical institutions in 2004. the in vitro antibacterial activity of the above antibiotics against clinical strains isolated in 2004 was compared with that against part of the clinical strains isolated about ten years ago (1994 - 1996). the antibacterial activity of ctrx against streptococcus including penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant streptocuccus pneumoniae was potent and there were no large differences between clinical strains isolated in 1994 - 1996 and those in 2004 in the antibacterial activity of ctrx. ctrx inhibited the growth of all the strains of haemophilus influenzae including beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant (blnar) strains at 0.5 microg/ml or less and showed the potent antibacterial activity against these strains. in addition, since there are no large differences between strains isolated in the past and those isolated in 2004 in the antibacterial activity, ctrx is considered to be a useful antibiotic in the treatment of blnar infections which are increased by the causative organism of infections especially in the field of pediatrics in recent years. ctrx showed the excellent antibacterial activity against escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae but one of the 50 strains of e. coli tested was highly resistant. the antibacterial activity of ctrx against neisseria gonorrhoeae was the most potent in all the antibiotics tested. these results indicate that ctrx shows excellent antimicrobial activity against fresh strains isolated from patients with infections. ctrx is thus useful as a therapeutic antimicrobial for the treating a variety of infections.

TI  == [surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to panipenem between 2000 and 2003].
AB  == for the post-marketing surveillance of panipenem/betamipron (papm/bp, carbenin),  mics of injectable beta-lactam antibacterials including papm against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over japan are measured yearly and the  incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. in the first surveillance from june 2000 to march 2001, 1,356 isolates of 28 species were tested, 1,221 isolates of the same 28 species were tested in the second surveillance from april 2001 to march 2002, and 1,403 isolates of the same 28 species were tested in the third surveillance from april 2002 to march 2003. no remarkable changes in the activity of papm were observed in these surveillances spanning three years. the activity of papm in this study was comparable to that in the studies conducted before carbenin was launched. this result suggests that  papm still maintains potent activity. in these surveillances spanning three years, the incidence rates of resistance in various species were as follows (2000.6-2001.3 --> 2001.4-2002.3 --> 2002.4-2003.3): methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (39.3% --> 43.9% --> 47.3%), penicillin-intermediate streptococcus pneumoniae (48.9% --> 44.2% --> 25.7%), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp, 13.8% --> 26.3% --> 43.2%), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli (0.9% --> 0% --> 1.4%), esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4% --> 1.3% --> 3.1%), beta-lactamase-producing haemophilus influenzae (19.2% --> 8.9% --> 42.9%), beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae (blnar, 22.1% --> 30.7% --> 33.0%), and metallo-beta-lactamase-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.0% --> 4.4% --> 1.0%). papm showed the most potent activity among tested drugs against prsp, whose incidence rate increased notably. blnar, whose incidence rates also increased, exhibited low susceptibility to all tested drugs and metallo-beta-lactamase-producing p. aeruginosa also exhibited high resistance. the findings of this surveillance indicate that it is necessary to pay careful attention to the trends of resistant bacteria such as prsp, blnar, and metallo-beta-lactamase producing strains.

TI  == [study on treatment strategy for ventriculitis associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus].
AB  == objective: to study the treatment strategy for ventriculitis associated with ventriculo peritoneal shunt for hydrocephalus. methods: for all of the patients suspected to have cerebrospinal fluid (csf) infections, the first step of treatment was removal of the "infected" shunts, then a ventricular drainage was placed in frontal horn of the ventricle, and at the same time csf was obtained from the ventricle for bacterial culture and tests of bacterial sensitivities to  antibiotics. after the shunt removal and before the result from bacterial cultures was obtained, 25-50 mg of vancomycin was administered intraventricularly daily. as soon as the result from bacterial cultures was obtained, antibiotics should be adjusted according to the sensitivity test result. by the time of the infections being controlled, appropriate treatments including reshunting would finally be given for hydrocephalus if necessary. results: among 11 patients, 9 were infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci or staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus, one of them with concomitant infection of aerobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacteriaceae aerogenesis, 1 patient with streptococci, and another one with mycobacterium stercoris bovis. the tests of drug sensitivity showed that cocci in infection of 9 patients were all sensitive  to vancomycin, but only 1 of them sensitive to gentamycin. there were other sensitive antibiotics for streptococcus in 1 case and for bacillus in 2 patients. practically vancomycin was effective for 8 of 11 patients, including one case of  streptococcal infection. the duration for anti-infection treatment was in a range of 16-36 days. finally, all of 11 patients survived from the shunt ventriculitis, and 9 of them had significant improvement in their neurological functions. conclusion: (1)intraventricular administration of proper antibiotics is a reliable and effective way to treat ventriculitis associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunts. (2)vancomycin is the preferred antibiotic for ventriculitis, but other kind(s) of some antibiotics are necessary in a few patients in addition to or instead of vancomycin. (3)the effect of systemic use of antibiotics could not be defined in this series of patients, but this may be used as an adjunct in the practice. (4)there are many problems related to diagnosis and treatment of shunt ventriculitis that should be studied more extensively and deeply.

TI  == potency and spectrum trends for cefepime tested against 65746 clinical bacterial  isolates collected in north american medical centers: results from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (1998-2003).
AB  == we evaluated the antimicrobial spectrum and potency of cefepime and selected comparators agents against clinical bacterial strains collected in north america  over a 6-year period (1998-2003). isolates were consecutively collected from bloodstream (44%), respiratory tract (41%), urinary tract (6%), and skin/soft tissue (5%) infections in 48 medical centers. isolates were susceptibility tested by reference broth microdilution methods in a central laboratory. oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci were excluded from the analysis. imipenem (mic90 = 1 microg/ml, 99.9% susceptible) was the most active compound tested against enterobacteriaceae (22860 isolates tested) followed by cefepime (mic90 = 0.25 microg/ml, 99.5% susceptible) > amikacin (99.4% susceptible) > ceftriaxone (95.6% susceptible) > aztreonam (95.1% susceptible). among comparators, the lowest susceptibility rate for enterobacteriaceae was observed with ciprofloxacin (92.8% susceptible). imipenem was also the most active compound against esbl-producing klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli (99.3% and 100% susceptible, respectively), followed by amikacin (81.4% and 97.2% susceptible, respectively) and cefepime (92.5% and 93.8% susceptible, respectively). cefepime activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa (85.2% susceptible) was similar to that of imipenem (86.9% susceptible). against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, cefepime (mic90 = 4 microg/ml, 100.0% susceptible) was 4-fold more active than ceftazidime (mic90 = 16 microg/ml, 86.4% susceptible) and showed a higher susceptibility rate than ciprofloxacin (93.2% susceptible). cefepime was the most active compound tested against streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90 = 1 microg/ml, 97.4% susceptible), ranked after gatifloxacin and levofloxacin (99.2% susceptible). the activity of cefepime remained stable during the study period evaluated with the susceptibility rates varying from 99.3% to 99.8% among the enterobacteriaceae and 84.4% to 88.4% among p. aeruginosa isolates. in summary, cefepime has retained broad activity and spectrum against enterobacteriaceae, p. aeruginosa, and gram-positive cocci (except oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci) isolated from north american medical centers in the 1998-2003 period. continued resistance surveillance is critical to monitor the effectiveness of widely used parenteral antimicrobial agents such as cefepime.

AB  == emerging antimicrobial resistance among respiratory tract pathogens has created a critical need for development of new antimicrobial agents that are not affected by the commonly occurring genetic resistance mechanisms. tigecycline, a novel broad-spectrum parenteral glycylcycline, has been shown to be active against many of gram-positive, gram-negative, atypical, and anaerobic organisms, including strains highly resistant to commonly prescribed antimicrobials and was recently approved by the us food and drug administration for treating infections of skin and skin structures, and for intra-abdominal infections. in this study, tigecycline spectrum and potency were evaluated against a global collection of pathogens (2000-2004) recovered from community-acquired respiratory infections (7580 strains) or from hospitalized patients with pneumonia (3183 strains). among community-acquired infections, the ranking pathogens were haemophilus influenzae  (52.9%; 21% ampicillin-resistant), streptococcus pneumoniae (39.2%; 23.7% penicillin-nonsusceptible), and moraxella catarrhalis (7.9%). tigecycline displayed potent activity by inhibiting 100% of the 3 species at clinically achievable concentrations (2, 1, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). the 10 most prevalent pathogens producing 94.3% of pneumonias in hospitalized patients were staphylococcus aureus (48.5% of strains; 49.4% oxacillin-resistant), pseudomonas  aeruginosa (15.6%), klebsiella spp. (5.6%), s. pneumoniae (4.6%), acinetobacter spp. (4.5%), enterobacter spp. (4.0%), escherichia coli (3.8%), serratia marcescens (2.5%), enterococcus spp. (2.3%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.8%), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (1.1%). at a concentration of 4 microg/ml, tigecycline inhibited >96% of these pathogens (exception, p. aeruginosa). s. aureus was readily inhibited by tigecycline (mic50 and mic90, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively) with all strains inhibited at < or =1 microg/ml. streptococci recovered from hospitalized patients (beta-hemolytic and s. pneumoniae) were also very susceptible to tigecycline with the highest mic being  0.12 microg/ml. all e. coli (including 13.3% with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase [esbl] phenotype) were inhibited by < or =1 microg/ml, and all klebsiella (25.8% esbl phenotype) and enterobacter spp. plus 97.0% of serratia spp. were inhibited by < or =4 microg/ml. tigecycline was also active against acinetobacter spp. and s. maltophilia strains (mic50 and mic90, 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively). further clinical studies should consider the role that  tigecycline may play in the therapy for severe respiratory tract infections, both of nosocomial and community origin.

TI  == tigecycline activity tested against 26,474 bloodstream infection isolates: a collection from 6 continents.
AB  == the activity of tigecycline (formerly gar936), a novel glycylcycline, was tested  against recent bloodstream infection (bsi) pathogen isolates from 6 continents. frequency of clinical occurrence of these pathogens was determined and their antibiograms assessed using reference broth microdilution methods. a total of 26474 strains were tested for tigecycline susceptibility according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (formerly the national committee for  clinical laboratory standards) by the m7-a6 guidelines with interpretations from  m100-s15 and the package insert. the rank order of pathogens was staphylococcus aureus (33.1%), escherichia coli (14.0%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (13.5%), enterococcus spp. (12.3%), klebsiella spp. (5.7%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.2%), enterobacter spp. (3.0%), beta-hemolytic streptococci (2.9%),  streptococcus pneumoniae (2.3%), and viridans group streptococci (1.4%). tigecycline exhibited a broader spectrum of activity against bsi isolates when compared to ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, aminoglycosides, and many beta-lactams (imipenem). tigecycline was highly active against most pathogens tested, including staphylococci (mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml), enterococci (mic90, 0.25 microg/ml), streptococci (mic(90), < or =0.12 microg/ml), escherichia coli (mic90, 0.25 microg/ml), klebsiella spp. (mic90, 1 mmicrog/ml), and enterobacter  spp. (mic(90), 2 mmicrog/ml), but showed limited inhibition of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 16 microg/ml) and indole-positive or indole-negative proteae (mic90, 4-8 microg/ml). in summary, tigecycline exhibited a wide spectrum of antimicrobial potency versus bsi isolates collected worldwide. serious infections in nosocomial environments should benefit from tigecycline use among the investigational phase 3 agents focused toward resistant strains.

TI  == the antibiotic treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia admitted to the critical care unit.
AB  == community-acquired pneumonias (cap) are still caused by streptococcus pneumoniae, hemophilus influenzae, or moraxella catarrhalis. legionella and chlamydia pneumoniae have been defined as important atypical pathogens causing cap. klebsiella causes cap primarily in patients with chronic alcoholism or in chronic care facilities. normal hosts do not present with "unusual pathogens'' e.g., staphylococcus aureus or pseudomonas aeruginosa. the clinical severity of a bacterial pneumonia has important prognostic implications and predicts admission  to intensive care units, duration of therapy, and complications. the factors that determine the severity of a cap are less related to the pathogen than the underlying cardiopulmonary status of the patient as well as the patient's humoral immunity. relatively avirulent pathogens may result in severe cap in patients with diminished/absent splenic function or significant cardiopulmonary disease. a critical concept is to appreciate that the selection of antimicrobial therapy is  not dependent on co-morbidities since the antimicrobial therapy is directed against the pathogen and not the co-morbidities. therefore the treatment of cap,  whether moderate or severe is with the same antibiotic at the same dose. many antibiotic regimens are equally efficacious in the treatment of cap. the most cost effective optimal regimen covers both typical and atypical pathogens, e.g.,  levofloxacin, and is currently the preferred antibiotic approach to moderate or severe cap in the ccu.

TI  == etiology of community acquired pneumonia among adult patients requiring hospitalization in taiwan.
AB  == background: there has not been a comprehensive multi-center study investigating the microbial profile of community acquired pneumonia (cap) in taiwan. methods: a prospective study of adult cap patients requiring hospitalization between december 2001 and april 2002 was carried out in 13 hospitals in taiwan. etiology  was determined based on laboratory data from blood and sputum cultures plus serology from paired serum and urine antigen detection tests. results: etiology was assigned to 99 (58.9%) of the 168 patients having the most complete data for  etiology determination, with mixed infection in 21 (12.5%) patients. more than half (51.8%) of the patients were>60 years and 63.7% of the patients were males.  the most common etiologic agent was streptococcus pneumoniae (40, 23.8%), the majority (60%, 24 cases) of which was detected by positive urine antigen test. other common agents included mycoplasma pneumoniae (24, 14.3%), chlamydia pneumoniae (12, 7.1%), influenza a virus (11, 6.5%), klebsiella pneumoniae (8, 4.8%) and haemophilus influenzae (8, 4.8%). the prevalence of s. pneumoniae and m. pneumoniae was highest in patients>60 years (25/87, 28.7%), and<44 years (12/59, 19%), respectively; while k. pneumoniae comprised a larger proportion (4/22, 18%) in the 45-59 years group. conclusions: s. pneumoniae was the most common etiology agent in adult patients hospitalized due to cap in taiwan and the spectrum of other major pathogens was similar to studies conducted elsewhere in the world. empiric treatment recommendations developed in other parts of the world may be appropriately adapted for local use after taking into account local  resistance profiles. our data also support the recommendation that urine antigen  test be added as an adjunct to adult cap etiology diagnosis protocol.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline against isolates from patients enrolled in phase 3 clinical trials of treatment for complicated skin and skin-structure infections and complicated intra-abdominal infections.
AB  == the in vitro activity of tigecycline was evaluated against 4913 baseline pathogens isolated from 1986 patients enrolled in 4 pivotal phase 3 clinical trials. the trials, which were conducted in 38 countries worldwide, involved patients with complicated skin and skin-structure infections or complicated intra-abdominal infections. tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens for each infection type, including gram-positive and gram-negative strains of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria (mics, < or =2 microg/ml for most  pathogens). the spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant s. aureus), streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and bacteroides  fragilis. a few genera, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and members of the tribe proteeae, were generally less susceptible to tigecycline than were other gram-negative pathogens. the susceptibility of the pathogens to tigecycline was similar for isolates obtained from patients enrolled in the studies of complicated skin and skin-structure infection or of complicated intra-abdominal infection. for most pathogens, the susceptibility to tigecycline was similar across all geographic regions. the excellent expanded broad-spectrum activity of  tigecycline demonstrated in vitro against clinical isolates confirmed its potential utility for pathogens associated with complicated skin and skin-structure infections or complicated intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in bulgaria--a synopsis from bulstar 2003.
AB  == we introduce bulgarian surveillance tracking antimicrobial resistance (bulstar) and make the first report on surveillance data for 2003. this longitudinal surveillance programme monitors the isolation and antimicrobial susceptibility of all clinically significant microorganisms isolated from blood cultures, cerebrospinal fluid, upper and lower respiratory tract, urine and wound samples in the participating microbiology laboratories. twenty eight public, 45 hospital  and 6 private laboratories from all 28 counties of the republic of bulgaria participated in bulstar 2003. the total number of isolates from monitored sources during the surveillance period was 98 929. seven microorganisms represented 72% of all isolated bacteria in bulstar 2003: escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, proteus-providencia-morganella group, klebsiella spp., pseudomonas spp, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. generally the resistance of  clinically significant gram positive and gram negative bacteria in bulgaria was estimated to be at a medium level when compared with many other surveillance sources worldwide. a unique 32-year experiment on the population by treating all  severe infections with an ampicillin/gentamicin combination resulted in twofold higher levels of resistance to amynoglycosides compared with other countries worldwide. this is due to the extremely conservative treatment schemes used in the former socialist countries, based on national directives and cheap domestic production of gentamicin and ampicillin. the forthcoming introduction of a computer network and improvements in detecting mistakes are expected to increase  the sensitivity and the significance of bulstar surveillance system - an indispensable tool in the combat against increasing worldwide antibiotic resistance.

TI  == role of the acrab-tolc efflux pump in determining susceptibility of haemophilus influenzae to the novel peptide deformylase inhibitor lbm415.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae isolates vary widely in their susceptibilities to the peptide deformylase inhibitor lbm415 (mic range, 0.06 to 32 microg/ml); however,  on average, they are less susceptible than gram-positive organisms, such as staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. insertional inactivation of the h. influenzae acrb or tolc gene in strain nb65044 (rd strain kw20) increased  susceptibility to lbm415, confirming a role for the acrab-tolc pump in determining resistance. consistent with this, sequencing of a pcr fragment generated with primers flanking the acrra region from an lbm415-hypersusceptible  h. influenzae clinical isolate revealed a genetic deletion of acra. inactivation  of acrb or tolc in several clinical isolates with atypically reduced susceptibility to lbm415 (mic of 16 microg/ml or greater) significantly increased susceptibility, confirming that the pump is also a determinant of decreased susceptibility in these clinical isolates. examination of acrr, encoding the putative repressor of pump gene expression, from several of these strains revealed mutations introducing frameshifts, stop codons, and amino acid changes relative to the published sequence, suggesting that loss of pump repression leads to decreased susceptibility. supporting this, nb65044 acrr mutants selected by exposure to lbm415 at 8 microg/ml had susceptibilities to lbm415 and other pump substrates comparable to the least sensitive clinical isolates and showed increased expression of pump genes.

TI  == in-house validation of the bactec 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: at present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the fda for the purpose of quality control (qc) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates: the bact/alert blood culture system (biomerieux) and the pall ebds (pall corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived plts. after the decision of the aabb to institute universal qc testing of plt concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the  performance of our current blood culture system, the bactec 9240, was carried out for this purpose. study design and methods: serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with plt contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis plt unit per organism. four ml of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (cfus) per ml was inoculated into blood culture bottles (standard 10 aerobic/f, becton-dickinson diagnostic systems) and incubated in a bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to  insure the identity of bacterial growth. results: with the exception of streptococcus mitis, the bactec system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 cfus per ml for staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the limit of detection for the  s. mitis test strain was 61 cfus per ml. detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis plt products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. conclusion: this study validates the use of the bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis plts in  less than 24 hours.

TI  == deep neck infection in diabetic patients: comparison of clinical picture and outcomes with nondiabetic patients.
AB  == objective: to compare the difference in the clinical picture and outcomes between diabetic and nondiabetic patients with deep neck infections. study design and setting: we retrospectively reviewed the records of patients who were diagnosed with deep neck infections and who received treatment at the department of otolaryngology of national taiwan university hospital between 1997 and 2002. one  hundred eighty-five patients were included in our study. fifty-six patients with  diabetes mellitus were enrolled for further analysis (diabetic group) and compared with the other 129 patients without diabetes mellitus (nondiabetic group) in demography, etiology, bacteriology, treatment, duration of hospital stay, complications, and outcome. results: the parapharyngeal space was the space most commonly involved in both the diabetic (33.9%) and nondiabetic groups (40.3%). odontogenic infections and upper airway infections were the 2 leading causes of deep neck infection in diabetic and nondiabetic groups. streptococcus viridans is the most commonly isolated organism in the nondiabetic group (43.7%). however, the most common organism in the diabetic group was klebsiella pneumoniae (56.1%). there were 89.3% of diabetic patients, versus 71.3% of nondiabetic patients, with abscess formation ( p = 0.0136). surgical drainage was performed more frequently in the diabetic group than in the nondiabetic group (86.0% versus 65.2%, p = 0.0142). in comparison with the nondiabetic group, the diabetic group  tended to have older mean age (57.2 y versus 46.2 y, p = 0.0007), longer duration of hospital stay (19.7 days versus 10.2 days, p < 0.0001), more frequent complications (33.9% versus 8.5%, p < 0.0001), and more frequent tracheostomy or  intubation (19.6% versus 6.2%, p = 0.0123). conclusions: patients with diabetes mellitus are susceptible to deep neck infection. we should pay more attention when dealing with deep neck infections in patients with diabetes mellitus because those patients tend to have complications more frequently and a longer duration of hospital stay. empirical antibiotics should cover k. pneumoniae in patients with deep neck infection who have diabetes mellitus.

TI  == etiologies and treatment outcomes in patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (cap) at srinagarind hospital, khon kaen, thailand.
AB  == local epidemiological data on the etiologies of in-patients who are hospitalized  with cap is needed to develop guidelines for clinical practice. this study was conducted to determine the pattern of microorganisms causing community-acquired pneumonia (cap) in adult patients admitted to srinagarind hospital, khon kaen, thailand, between january 2001 and december 2002. altogether, 254 patients (124 males, 130 females) averaging 56.4 (sd 19.8) years were included. eighty-six of them (33.8%) presented with severe cap on initial clinical presentation. the etiologies for the cap cases were discovered by isolating the organisms from the  blood, sputum, pleural fluid, and other sterile sites. serology for chlamydia pneunmoniae and mycoplasma pneumoniae were performed to diagnose current infection. the causative organisms were identified in 145 patients (57.1%). streptococcus pneumoniae was the commonest pathogen, identified in 11.4% of the cases, followed by burkholderia pseudomallei (11.0%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (10.2%). the atypical pathogens, c. pneumoniae and m. pneumoniae, accounted for 8.7% and 3.9% of the isolates, respectively. sixteen patients (6.3%) had dual infections; c. pneumoniae was the most frequent coinfecting pathogen. the average length of hospital stay was 12.9 (sd 14.0) days, with 27.9% staying more than 2 weeks. overall, 83.9% of the patients improved with treatment, 10.2% did not improve and 5.9% died. the most common complications were acute respiratory failure (31.1%) and septic shock (20.9%). we conclude that initial antibiotic use should cover the atypical pathogens, c. pneumoniae and m. pneumoniae, in hospitalized cap patients. b. pseudomallei is an endemic pathogen in northeast thailand, and should be considered in cases of severe cap.

AB  == between october 2000 and december 2002, a prospective study was conducted among hospitalized community acquired pneumonia (cap) patients admitted to srinagarind  hospital, khon kaen, thailand. the diagnosis of chlamydia pneumoniae infection was based on serologic testing. the prevalence of c. pneumoniae among patients hospitalized with cap was 8.7%; 24 cases of 276 hospitalized cap patients. the mean age was 42.7 (range, 17-79) years and the male to female ratio was 1:2.4. more than half (54.2%) of them were without underlying disease. the mean duration of symptoms prior to admission was 5.5 (sd 3.7) days. leukocytosis was found in 62.5% of patients. localized patchy alveolar infiltration was the most common radiographic finding, followed by bilateral interstitial infiltration. over half  (52.4%) of the patients had a non-productive cough. gram-positive diplococci or no organisms predominated in cases where adequate sputum was obtained. dual infection was found in 45.8% of cases, mostly with streptococcus spp or klebsiella pneumoniae. four patients (16.7%) had an initial clinical presentation of severe cap; 3 of 4 had a dual infection. ten patients (41.7%) received macrolides or a macrolide plus a third generation beta-lactam at the beginning of management. two patients (8.3%) did not improve clinically and were transferred home. the average hospital stay was 11 .5 (range, 1-45) days. parapneumonic effusions complicated 20.8% of the cases. other complications included acute respiratory failure (16.7%), shock (8.3%), hospital-acquired pneumonia (8.3%), and acute renal failure (4.2%). we concluded that c. pneumoniae caused a wide variation of clinical presentations ranging from mild disease to severe cap. co-infection with other bacterial pathogens was a common finding. use of macrolides or new fluoroquinolones as part of an initial therapeutic regimen should be considered to cover this organism.

AB  == sixty-five consecutive eligible adult patients, who were treated as outpatients for stable severe-to-very severe copd, were enrolled in the study. all of them received 23-valent pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccine intramuscularly.  patients were seen monthly, as well as whenever they had symptoms suggestive of an exacerbation, at our outpatient clinic. eighteen out of 65 patients suffered from acute exacerbation (aecopd). three of these patients presented two episodes  of aecopd. patients with an acute exacerbation of copd received azithromycin 500  mg/day once daily for 3 days and a short course of oral prednisolone 25 mg/die. in 16 cases, a single species was isolated, while in the remaining 5 cases at least two species were recovered. clinical cure or improvement at the end of therapy (3-5 days post-therapy) was reported in 17 episodes of aecopd with no relapse at the late post-therapy (10-14 days after the completion of treatment).  bacteriologic eradication or presumptive eradication rates at the end of therapy  were 86% (24 out of 28 isolates). azithromycin eradicated all isolates of haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, h. parainfluenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and klebsiella spp. isolated at baseline. eradication of sta aureus occurred in 1 of 3 isolates whereas azithromycin was unable to eradicate pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. our data seem to indicate that pneumococcal vaccination reduces the possibility that an aecopd is caused by streptococcus pneumoniae. this finding allows the use of antibiotics such as azithromycin, which, otherwise, should be avoided because of resistances.

TI  == is a change in the vaginal flora associated with an increased risk of preterm birth?
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to determine if a change in the vaginal  flora was associated with an increased risk of preterm birth, and to determine if metronidazole therapy before 32 weeks increased the risk of preterm birth. study  design: we compared cultures taken at 23 to 26 weeks of gestation with cultures taken at delivery from women enrolled in the vaginal infections and preterm birth study to analyze the association of changes in the vaginal flora with preterm birth. results: metronidazole therapy before 32 weeks was associated with an increased risk of preterm birth (or 1.5, 95%ci 1.05-2.1) in an unadjusted model.  a change to heavy growth of escherichia coli or klebsiella pneumoniae at delivery was found to be associated with preterm birth (or 2.4, 95%ci 1.6-3.8). after controlling for race, parity, prepregnancy weight <100 pounds, smoking or drinking during pregnancy, trichomonas vaginalis, bacterial vaginosis, chlamydia, mycoplasmas, group b streptococcus, metronidazole therapy before 32 weeks, vaginal ph >5.0, and an increase in e coli or k pneumoniae , only prepregnancy weight <100 pounds (adjusted odds ratio [aor] 2.07, 95%ci 1.01-4.21) and increased e coli or k pneumoniae in the vagina at delivery (aor 2.99, 95%ci 1.37-6.53) were found to be significantly associated with preterm birth. conclusion: an increase in e coli or k pneumoniae in the vagina is an independent risk factor for preterm birth. changes in the vaginal flora may explain the increased risk of preterm birth seen with vaginal clindamycin or oral metronidazole therapy.

TI  == changing bacteriology of adult community-acquired lung abscess in taiwan: klebsiella pneumoniae versus anaerobes.
AB  == background: most literature regarding lung abscess focuses on anaerobic bacterial lung abscess, and aerobic gram-negative bacillary infection is less frequently discussed. this study was conducted to investigate the bacteriology of community-acquired lung abscess and to improve the empirical therapeutic strategy for adults with community-acquired lung abscess. methods: we reviewed and analyzed data on 90 consecutive adult cases of bacteriologically confirmed community-acquired lung abscess treated during 1995-2003 at a tertiary university hospital in taiwan. results: we found that a high proportion (21%) of cases of lung abscess were due to klebsiella pneumoniae infection, which differs from the  findings of previous studies. lung abscess due to k. pneumoniae was associated with underlying diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [or], 4.3; 95% confidence interval  [ci], 1.0-18.4; p = .039) and negatively correlated with a time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis of >30 days (or, 0.2; 95% ci, 0.1-0.7; p = .008). a higher  percentage of patients with k. pneumoniae lung abscess had concomitant bacteremia (or, 9.4; 95% ci, 1.1-81.9; p = .032), delayed defervesence (or, 9.2; 95% ci, 1.8-47.8; p = .004), and multiple cavities noted on radiographs (or, 11.0; 95% ci, 1.3-94.9; p = .015), compared with patients with anaerobic bacterial lung abscess. the rate of nonsusceptibility to clindamycin and penicillin among anaerobes and streptococcus milleri group isolates increased. conclusion: k. pneumoniae has become a more common cause of lung abscess than before, and a high proportion of anaerobes and s. milleri strains have become resistant to penicillin and clindamycin. a beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor or second- or  third-generation cephalosporin with clindamycin or metronidazole is suggested as  empirical antibiotic therapy for community-acquired lung abscess.

TI  == [nosocomial bacteremia: epidemiology and current antimicrobial drugs resistances].
AB  == nosocomial bacteremia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. a change is being observed in the distribution of its causative agents, as well as an increase in the resistances to some antimicrobial drugs. we have analyzed 600 significant bacteremia episodes during the year 2002, studying the resistances to antimicrobial drugs and some epidemiological aspects. bacteremias caused by gram-positive were 57%, while the ones caused by gram-negative were 46.1%. the three microorganisms more frequently isolated were staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. in s. aureus low resistance to oxacillin (10.3%) was observed. streptococcus pneumoniae with lower sensitivity to penicillin was observed in 49.9%. resistance of gram-positive microorganisms to vancomycin/teicoplanin was not observed. e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae showed low prevalence of expanded spectrum ss-lactamase strains. there are differences in epidemiology of bacteremias at regional level, and continuous local programs for monitoring resistances to antimicrobial drugs are needed.

TI  == cefdinir: an oral alternative to parenteral cephems.
AB  == cost savings are possible if oral cephems of equivalent efficacy can be substituted for parenteral cephems. an in vitro study was performed to compare the activity of cefdinir, cefoxitin, cefazolin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and cefepime against 243 clinical isolates of human pathogens. activities were determined by national committee for clinical laboratory standards microbroth dilution methodology using an inoculum of approximately 5 x 10(5) cfu/ml. cefdinir was the single or equally most potent agent against streptococcus pyogenes, penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and klebsiella pneumoniae isolates that produced a variety of beta-lactamase types. cefdinir was less potent than ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and cefepime against haemophilus influenzae, but was 2- to 8-fold more potent than cefoxitin and 8- to 32-fold more potent than cefazolin. cefdinir was slightly less potent than ceftazidime, against beta-lactamase-positive moraxella catarrhalis. these data support clinical consideration of cefdinir as an alternative to parenteral cephems in infections where adequate tissue levels can be safely assured.

TI  == statistical assessment of a laboratory method for growing biofilms.
AB  == microbial biofilms have been grown in laboratories using a variety of different approaches. a laboratory biofilm reactor system, called the cdc biofilm reactor (cbr) system, has been devised for growing biofilms under moderate to high fluid  shear stress. the reactor incorporates 24 removable biofilm growth surfaces (coupons) for sampling and analysing the biofilm. following preliminary experiments to verify the utility of the cbr system for growing biofilms of several clinically relevant organisms, a standard operating procedure for growing a pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm was created. this paper presents the results of  a rigorous, intra-laboratory, statistical evaluation of the repeatability and ruggedness of that procedure as well as the results of the experiments with clinically relevant organisms. for the statistical evaluations, the outcome of interest was the density (c.f.u. cm(-2)) of viable p. aeruginosa. replicate experiments were conducted to assess the repeatability of the log density outcome. the mean p. aeruginosa log10 density was 7.1, independent of the coupon  position within the reactor. the repeatability standard deviation of the log density based on one coupon per experiment was 0.59. analysis of variance showed  that the variability of the log density was 53 % attributable to within-experiment sources and 47 % attributable to between-experiments sources. the ruggedness evaluation applied response-surface design and regression analysis techniques, similar to those often used for sensitivity analyses in other fields  of science and engineering. this approach provided a quantitative description of  ruggedness; specifically, the amount the log density was altered by small adjustments to four key operational factors--time allowed for initial surface colonization, temperature, nutrient concentration, and fluid shear stress on the  biofilm. the small size of the regression coefficient associated with each operational factor showed that the method was rugged; that is, relatively insensitive to minor perturbations of the four factors. these results demonstrate that the cbr system is a reliable experimental tool for growing a standard biofilm in the laboratory and that it can be adapted to study several different micro-organisms.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of oral cephems against various clinically isolated strains and evaluation of efficacy based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics theory].
AB  == we compared the antimicrobial activity of commercially available oral cephem agents, cefaclor (ccl), cefroxadine (cxd), cefdinir (cfdn), cefixime (cfix), cefpodoxime (cpdx), cefteram (cftm), cefcapene (cfpn), and cefditoren (cdtr), against streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and esbl-producing bacteria isolated from clinical materials in kansai medical university hospital between 2002 and 2003. based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (pk/pd) theory, we determined the concentration of each agent at which the time above mic (tam) value was 40% or more, and calculated the rate of efficacy against each type of bacteria. in s. pneumoniae strains, the mic(50,80,90) values of cdtr were 0.25, 0.5, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, lower than those of the other agents, demonstrating the  most potent antimicrobial activity. however, the efficacy rate for cdtr calculated based on the pk/pd theory was 58.5%. cftm showed the highest efficacy  rate (66.1%). in h. influenzae strains, the antimicrobial activity of cdtr was most potent, followed by that of cftm and that of cfpn/cfix. the mic90 value of cdtr was lowest (0.25 microg/ml), followed by that of cftm (0.5 microg/ml). the efficacy rate for cdtr was 100%. this result supports that cdtr frequently eradicates h. influenzae. in e. coli strains, the mic90 values of the above agents, excluding ccl and cxd, ranged from 0.5 to 1 microg/ml. the antimicrobial  activity of cfix against k. pneumoniae was most potent, followed by that of cfdn/cpdx and that of cftm. in esbl-producing bacteria, most agents showed an mic90 value of more than 4 microg/ml. in s. agalactiae and s. pyogenes strains, all of the agents showed satisfactory mic values. in methi- cillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa) strains, cfdn and cxd showed a high efficacy rate, whereas the efficacy rates for the other agents were low. the frequent use of oral agents has increased the number of cephem-resistant bacteria. esbl-producing bacteria become highly resistant, and the presence or absence of response can be  readily evaluated. however, when a mutation of penicillin-binding protein (pbp) occurs, drug resistance is less marked. therefore, it is difficult to evaluate the treatment response in many cases. in s. pneumoniae strains, the efficacy rates for all of the agents were low in the evaluation using the pk/pd theory, suggesting that a dose higher than the standard dose should be established. thus, in the future, the efficacy should be evaluated based on the pk/pd theory, appropriate antimicrobial treatment should be administered, and the administration method that does not increase the number of resistant bacteria must be established.

TI  == [bacterial causes of meningitis in newborns].
AB  == introduction: bacterial meningitis jeopardizes the life of affected newborns and  in survived children often leaves permanent sequels. the sooner the diagnosis is  established and the therapy is started, the more a prosperous outcome can be expected. when the indication is established, lumbar punction should be performed. on the basis of the results of cytological and biochemical analyses of the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) that point to bacterial meningitis, the initial therapy should begin even before the results of bacteriological analyses. it is important to know which causes are to be expected in order to make an adequate choice of antibiotics for initial therapy. the aim of this study is to identify the causes of meningitis, frequency of their occurrings and mortality-rate in the affected newborns. patients and methods: a prospective study was carried out in the paediatric department of the institute from january 1, 1978 to december 31, 2000. patients originated from all parts of yugoslavia. after the establishing of indication, lumbar punction was performed. csf was sent to cytological, biochemical and bacteriological analyses. diagnosis of meningitis was established when at least two criteria of four were fulfilled: 1. isolation of the cause by csf culture; 2. elevation of csf leukocyte count more than 20 with predominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes; 3. hypoglucorrhachia (glycaemia less than 40 mg  percent or less than 50 percent of glycaemia); 4. identification of bacteria by the gram stain of csf sediment. in 173 newborns the cause of bacterial meningitis was confirmed. results and discussion: causes of meningitis were as follows: e. coli in 46 newborns (n) (26.5%), streptococcus b haemolyticus group b in 35 n (20.2%), k. pneumoniae in 27 n (15.6%), k. oxytoca in 3 n (1.7%), proteus spp in  14 n (8%), salmonella spp in 12 n, pseudomonas spp in 9 n, streptococcus pneumoniae in 9 n, acinetobacter calcoaceticus in 4 n, enterobacter spp in 3 n, l. monocytogenes and serratia marcescens and staphylococcus aureus in 2 n each, and in one n. meningitidis, streptococcus group d, citrobacter, morganella morganii and alkaligenes xilosoxidans. over the period 1978-1987, the most frequent causes were: e. coli (28.2%), sbhb (26.8%) and klebsiella spp (11.3%). over the period 1991-2000, order and frequency of causes had been changed: klebsiella spp (26.8%), e. coli (19.2%), sbhb (14.1%), etc. in addition, new causes appeared, namely: morganella morganii, citrobacter, k. oxitoca and alkaligenes xylosoxidans (table 2). of a total of 173 patients, 52 (30.1%) died:  of 124 children with meningitis caused by gram-negative bacteria, 39 (31.4%) died, and of 49 children with gram-positive bacteria, 13 (26.5%) died (table 1).  comparing the first and the last decade, mortality decreased by only 0.2% (table  2). the explanation might be that the patients came to the institute too late, and after manifestation of resistant and multiresistant causes that obscured the  appropriate selection of antibiotics for initial therapy. the precious time between the onset of the disease and start of the therapy was lost in this way. newborns with bacterial meningitis should be treated only in health institutions  where the intensive care units for newborns exist. conclusion: the most frequent  causes of meningitis are the following: e. coli, sbhb and klebsiella pn. frequency of causes of meningitis changed with time. new uncommon causes have appeared. the mortality-rate remained very high.

TI  == validation of a rapid diagnostic strategy for determination of significant bacterial counts in bronchoalveolar lavage samples.
AB  == context: bacterial cultures of bronchoscopic samples require 1 to 2 days for results to be available for use in clinical decisions. we developed a rapid diagnostic testing strategy that is highly sensitive for screening bacteria in bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) samples, with results available within hours of collection. objective: to validate the ability of a bacterial adenosine triphosphate (atp) assay and routine gram stain microscopy to detect significant  bacterial counts in bal samples. design: four hundred seventy-seven bal samples from 319 patients suspected of having pneumonia were tested using a rapid diagnostic strategy, consisting of gram stain and a bacterial atp assay. rapid results were compared with quantitative cultures with a positive cutoff of 10(4)  cfu/ml or higher. results: significant bacterial counts were identified in 107 samples (22%). the most common etiologic agents were staphylococcus aureus (25%), haemophilus influenzae (17%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (12%). the rapid test  results were false negative in 5 cases (s aureus in 2, both klebsiella pneumoniae and s aureus in 1, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia and s pneumoniae in 1 case each). the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of the rapid diagnostic strategy were 95.3%, 54.9%, 37.9%, 97.6%, and 63.9%, respectively. conclusion: a negative result with  this rapid diagnostic testing strategy rules out significant bacterial counts in  bal samples with a high degree of certainty and may allow use of narrow-spectrum  antimicrobial agents or withholding of empiric antimicrobial therapy in patients  suspected of having ventilator-associated pneumonia.

TI  == severe community-acquired pneumonia: assessment of microbial aetiology as mortality factor.
AB  == community-acquired pneumonia (cap) remains a major cause of mortality. the aetiology of cap has rarely been identified as a mortality risk factor. a prospective study was conducted to assess the prognostic factors of cap patients  admitted to the intensive care unit (centre hospitalier departmental felix guyon, st denis de la reunion, france), with a special emphasis on microbial aetiology.  all variables assessing severity were collected, with a special emphasis on microbial investigations. among 112 immunocompetent patients (mean+/-sd age 54.7+/-15.1 yrs), 84% were male. severity of cap was demonstrated by mortality rate (43%), shock (48%), simplified acute physiology score (saps; 46.4+/-21.6) and mechanical ventilation support (82%). mean risk factor score was 2.2+/-1.2. microbiological identification was obtained in 78.6% of cases, with positive blood culture in 33%. most frequently, microbial agents were streptococcus pneumoniae and klebsiella pneumoniae (42% and 22%, respectively). the univariate  analysis recorded the usual mortality variables: age, alcohol consumption, saps,  shock, mechanical ventilation, positive end expiratory pressure level, positive blood culture, multilobar infiltrates on chest radiograph, neutropenia, and acidosis, and found k. pneumoniae (versus s. pneumoniae, and all cap) as a mortality factor. the multivariate analysis demonstrated that septic shock (relative risk (rr) 141), k. pneumoniae cap (rr 27), saps (rr 10.7) and positive  blood culture (rr 2.7) were independent factors related to death. in conclusion,  the present study found that the microbial aetiology, klebsiella pneumoniae, was  an independent risk factor for mortality in severe community-acquired pneumonia.

TI  == [in vitro antibacterial activity of cefdinir against isolates of respiratory tract pathogens in children].
AB  == objective: to study the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefdinir against clinical isolates of respiratory tract pathogens in children. methods: mic values of cefdinir against 380 strains were determined with e-test method and compared with those of cefaclor. results: all penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp) strains were also susceptible to cefdinir and cefaclor. both cefdinir and cefaclor were not active against penicillin-resistant sp (prsp). against penicillin-intermediate sp (pisp) the susceptibility rates of cefdinir and cefaclor were 70.1% and 57.4%, respectively. the activity of cefdinir and cefaclor against beta-lactamases negative hemophilus influenzae (hi) was excellent, but the susceptibility rates of cefdinir and cefaclor against beta-lactamases positive hi were 85.0% and 70.0%, respectively with mic(90) of 1.5 mg/l vs. 256.0 mg/l. cefdinir presented higher activities and lower mic values than cefaclor against moraxella catarrhalis (mc), group a streptococcus (gas), methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), and extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) negative escherichia coli (e. coli) or klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pn). both cefdinir and cefaclor were not susceptible to esbls positive e. coli and k. pn. conclusions: cefdinir exhibits excellent activity against pssp, pisp, hi, as well as mc, gas, mssa and esbls negative e. coli or k. pn.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16srdna oligonucleotide array].
AB  == objective: the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. however conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological  assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. on the basis of special gene sequence, pcr provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. but it is  difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic  agents. oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of  target genes. the objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the pcr product of 16srdna using a pair of universal  primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. methods: by comparison and analysis of the 16srdna sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. a pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight  species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. the probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of pcr  using the universal primers. results: the universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, neisseria meningitides, citrobacter freundii, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human dna as control. the results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could  not hybridize with other bacteria. the lowest concentration of dna (product of pcr) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. the results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. the results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. from the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common  infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. conclusions: despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system,  which contains amplification of the segment of 16rdna from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of pcr products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == in vitro activity of ertapenem against selected respiratory pathogens.
AB  == objectives: the in vitro activity of ertapenem was evaluated in comparison to 21  selected agents against a large collection of recently isolated respiratory tract pathogens including: 180 streptococcus pneumoniae, 100 streptococcus pyogenes, 70 haemophilus influenzae, 70 moraxella catarrhalis, 100 methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and 30 klebsiella pneumoniae. additional in vitro tests (time-kill curves with ertapenem alone and in combination with four other agents) for s. pneumoniae were carried out. methods: mic determinations and time-kill curves were carried out following the procedures suggested by the nccls. results: according to nccls susceptibility breakpoints, ertapenem was comparable to the most potent compounds tested for all pathogens studied. ertapenem was 100% active against penicillin-susceptible and -intermediate s. pneumoniae and against 60% of penicillin-resistant strains. time-kill tests at 4x mic confirmed a pronounced bactericidal potency of ertapenem against these organisms. interactions of ertapenem with several other agents against pneumococci resulted in clear synergic interactions (98.4%). indifference was extremely rare and antagonism was not observed. all s. pyogenes strains tested were inhibited by ertapenem, irrespective of their macrolide resistance phenotypes. ertapenem was also fully active against h. influenzae (100% susceptible) and m. catarrhalis (mic90 0.015-0.03 mg/l) even when capable of synthesizing beta-lactamases. methicillin-susceptible s. aureus and k. pneumoniae, including extended-spectrum  beta-lactamase-producing strains, were 100% susceptible to ertapenem. conclusions: our results indicate that ertapenem has a suitable spectrum of activity against organisms encountered in community-acquired bacterial respiratory tract infections.

TI  == prulifloxacin.
AB  == prulifloxacin, the prodrug of ulifloxacin, is a broad-spectrum oral fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent. after absorption, prulifloxacin is metabolised by esterases to ulifloxacin. the drug has a long elimination half-life, allowing once-daily administration. ulifloxacin is generally more active in vitro than other fluoroquinolones against a variety of clinical isolates of gram-negative bacteria, including community and nosocomial isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus, providencia and morganella spp., moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus spp. the activity of ulifloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa varies between countries. gram-positive organisms, including meticillin- or oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus spp. and italian community isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae are  susceptible to ulifloxacin. activity against spanish strains of s. pneumoniae is  moderate. in well designed clinical trials, good clinical and bacteriological efficacy (similar to that of ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or pefloxacin) was seen with prulifloxacin 600 mg once daily for 10 days in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis or complicated lower urinary tract infections (utis), and with single-dose prulifloxacin 600 mg in acute, uncomplicated lower utis. prulifloxacin was generally well tolerated in clinical  trials, with a similar tolerability profile to that of ciprofloxacin.

TI  == lps-binding protein-deficient mice have an impaired defense against gram-negative but not gram-positive pneumonia.
AB  == lps-binding protein (lbp) can facilitate the transfer of cell wall components of  both gram-negative bacteria (lps) and gram-positive bacteria (lipoteichoic acid)  to inflammatory cells. although lbp is predominantly produced in the liver, recent studies have indicated that this protein is also synthesized locally in the lung by epithelial cells. to determine the role of lbp in the immune response to pneumonia, lbp gene-deficient (-/-) and normal wild-type (wt) mice were intra-nasally infected with either streptococcus pneumoniae or klebsiella pneumoniae, common gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, respectively. pneumococcal pneumonia was associated with a 7-fold rise in lbp concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of wt mice; lbp-/- mice infected with s. pneumoniae  showed a similar survival and a similar bacterial burden in their lungs 48 h post-infection. in klebsiella pneumonia, however, lbp-/- mice demonstrated a diminished survival together with an enhanced bacterial outgrowth in their lungs. these data suggest that lbp is important for a protective immune response in klebsiella pneumonia, but does not contribute to an effective host response in pneumococcal pneumonia.

TI  == deep neck infection: analysis of 185 cases.
AB  == purpose: this study reviews our experience with deep neck infections and tries to identify the predisposing factors of life-threatening complications. methods: a retrospective review was conducted of patients who were diagnosed as having deep  neck infections in the department of otolaryngology at national taiwan university hospital from 1997 to 2002. their demographics etiology, associated systemic diseases, bacteriology, radiology, treatment, duration of hospitalization, complications, and outcomes were reviewed. the attributing factors to deep neck infections, such as the age and systemic diseases of patients, were also analyzed. results: one hundred eighty-five charts were recorded; 109 (58.9%) were men, and 76 (41.1%) were women, with a mean age of 49.5 +/- 20.5 years. ninety-seven (52.4%) of the patients were older than 50 years old. there were 63  patients (34.1%) who had associated systemic diseases, with 88.9% (56/63) of those having diabetes mellitus (dm). the parapharyngeal space (38.4%) was the most commonly involved space. odontogenic infections and upper airway infections  were the two most common causes of deep neck infections (53.2% and 30.5% of the known causes). streptococcus viridans and klebsiella pneumoniae were the most common organisms (33.9%, 33.9%) identified through pus cultures. k. pneumoniae was also the most common infective organism (56.1%) in patients with dm. of the abscess group (142 patients), 103 patients (72.5%) underwent surgical drainages.  thirty patients (16.2%) had major complications during admission, and among them, 18 patients received tracheostomies. those patients with underlying systemic diseases or complications or who received tracheostomy tended to have a longer hospital stay and were older. there were three deaths (mortality rate, 1.6%). all had an underlying systemic disease and were older than 72 years of age. conclusions: when dealing with deep neck infections in a high-risk group (older patients with dm or other underlying systemic diseases) in the clinic, more attention should be paid to the prevention of complications and even the possibility of death. early surgical drainage remains the main method of treating deep neck abscesses. therapeutic needle aspiration and conservative medical treatment are effective in selective cases such as those with minimal abscess formation.

TI  == community-acquired brain abscess in taiwan: etiology and probable source of infection.
AB  == brain abscess is a life-threatening infection caused by spread from infected parameningeal or remote foci. historically, streptococci have been the predominant organisms reported while brain abscess metastatic from liver abscess  caused by klebsiella pneumoniae has been a more recent emerging problem. this study retrospectively analyzed the characteristics of community-acquired brain abscess admitted during an 11-year period. there were 17 men and 7 women with age from 20 to 82 years (median, 41 years). the most common source of infection was liver abscess, followed by otitic infection and sinusitis. the classic triad of fever, headache and focal neurologic deficit was noted in only 25% of cases. spread of the abscess to multiple lobes was common (n = 6). the most commonly identified organisms were streptococcus spp. (n = 7) and k. pneumoniae (n = 5). all 5 cases of k. pneumoniae brain abscess also had concomitant pyogenic liver abscess and 4 of them had diabetes mellitus. in this study, brain abscess was common in young patients and in patients with diabetes mellitus. in taiwan, streptococcus spp. and k. pneumoniae are leading etiologies for community-acquired brain abscess. liver abscess is the most likely source of k. pneumoniae brain abscess.

AB  == background: bacterial detection of platelet (plt)-rich-plasma (prp)-derived plts  presents unique challenges for countries that do not allow pooling before storage. this study validated the bact/alert for use in testing pooled prp-derived plts with nine contaminating organisms. study design and methods: isolates of bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into two prp-derived plt pools (target, 10 and 100 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml; actual recovered concentrations, 5 and 90 cfus/ml). four milliliters of each postbacterial inoculation sample was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles and 0.5 ml was plated onto blood agar. results: all organisms (excluding p. acnes) were detected in 8.2 to 22.0 and 7.6 to 20.3 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively) and the mean time to detection was 15.0 and 13.1 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respective). p. acnes was detected with the anaerobic bottles in a mean of 74.9 and 64.3 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively). with e. cloacae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and s. viridans detection with the anaerobic bottles was faster or equivalent to the detection with the aerobic bottles. this was most notable with s. viridans where  the anaerobic bottle was reactive on average 21.6 and 10.8 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively) faster than the aerobic bottle. conclusions: this study validates the use of the bact/alert system for the detection of bacteria in prp-derived plts in a pooled format. overall, the use of the bact/alert system allowed the detection of pooled prp-derived plts inoculated with nine bacteria at 10 and 100 cfus per ml in 7.6 to 22.0 hours (excluding p. acnes).

TI  == incidence and etiological agents of bacterial meningitis among children <5 years  of age in two districts of romania.
AB  == to expand upon the limited comprehensive population-based data for childhood bacterial meningitis in eastern europe, the present study was conducted in the iasi and constanta districts of romania. from march 2000 through march 2002, children <5 years of age hospitalized for bacterial meningitis were enrolled in a prospective surveillance study. a total of 56 cases of bacterial meningitis were  identified, including 37 due to neisseria meningitidis (22 per 100,000 per year), 13 due to haemophilus influenzae type b (7.6 per 100,000 per year), and six due to streptococcus pneumoniae (3.5 per 100,000 per year). of the 31 meningococcal isolates that were serotyped, 12 were serogroup a, eight were serogroup b, and 11 were serogroup c. among all cases of bacterial meningitis, 25 occurred in children <1 year of age, including those due to meningococci (n=14), h. influenzae type b (n=7), pneumococci (n=3), and klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1). in romania the incidence of h. influenzae type b meningitis is similar to that found in other areas of southern and eastern europe during the pre-vaccination era, and the incidence of meningococcal meningitis is one of the highest yet found in europe. an unexpectedly high proportion of these meningococcal meningitis cases is due to serogroup a. disease burden could be substantially reduced through the  introduction of h. influenzae type b conjugate vaccine and, when available, meningococcal conjugate vaccine protective against serogroups a, b and c.

TI  == corneal infections after implantation of intracorneal ring segments.
AB  == purpose: to report risk factors, clinical course, and outcome in patients with infectious keratitis following implantation of intracorneal ring segments (icrs). methods: the records of 8 patients with culture-proven infectious keratitis after icrs (ferrara or intacs) implantation were retrospectively reviewed. age, gender, corneal findings, ocular abnormalities, the condition that led to icrs implantation, immediate prior use of a contact lens, elapsed time between implantation and the onset of symptoms, previous medications, and systemic disorders were noted. results: culture-positive infectious keratitis developed in 7 eyes of 7 patients (2 men and 5 women) with a mean age of 35 years who underwent ferrara implantation for the treatment of keratoconus and in a 29-year-old man who underwent intacs implantation for correction of low myopia. contact lens use, diabetes, and trauma were factors possibly associated with the  risk of infection in three cases. microorganisms, identified in all cases, included staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus viridans, streptococcus pneumoniae, pseudomonas sp, nocardia sp, klebsiella sp, and paecylomices sp. onset of symptoms of infection varied from less than 1 week to 22 months postoperatively,  depending on the infecting organism. conclusions: infectious keratitis following  icrs implantation is a sight-threatening complication for which early recognition and rapid institution of appropriate treatment may result in a better visual outcome.

TI  == evaluation of the hyplex bloodscreen multiplex pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  == we evaluated the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) system (bag, lich, germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification  of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive bactec 9240 blood culture bottles. the test involves amplification of the bacterial dna by multiplex pcr and subsequent hybridization  of the pcr product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an elisa-based format. the available probes allow the separate detection of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal meca  gene. the hyplex bloodscreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (s. aureus, 100%; s. epidermidis, 97.2%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). the specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (escherichia coli, 92.5%; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; klebsiella spp., 100%; enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; s. aureus, 100%, s. epidermidis, 97.7%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus  faecium, 99.6%; streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). the result of the meca gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of staphylococcus aureus investigated. in conclusion, the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-elisa system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the meca gene of staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.

TI  == evaluation of the uro-quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

TI  == enteric gram-negative bacilli bloodstream infections: 17 years' experience in a neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  == objective: to assess the occurrence of enteric gram-negative bacilli (egnb) bloodstream infections (bsi) in a neonatal intensive care setting during a 17-year period in which a consistent antibiotic treatment program was in place. to document infections, outbreaks, or epidemics, emergence of antibiotic resistance, clinical correlates, and outcomes of the most prevalent egnb (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae). methods: this study analyzed demographic, clinical, and bacteriologic information from 360 infants born 1986-2002 who developed 633 blood culture-proven bsi. a total of 121 egnb were isolated (e coli, k pneumoniae, and e cloacae). early-onset bsi were discovered within 48 hours from birth, and late-onset bsi were those that occurred thereafter. suspected early-onset bsi were treated with ampicillin and gentamicin, suspected late-onset bsi with vancomycin and gentamicin. antibiotics  were changed on the basis of organism antimicrobial susceptibility. results: early-onset bsi were noted in 52 of 21,336 (244/100,000) live births (1986-1991), 40 of 20,402 (196/100,000) live births (1992-1997), and 25 of 17,926 (139/100,000) live births (1998-2002). of these cases, 39 were caused by e coli and 4 by k pneumoniae. antibiograms for e coli isolated during the last 5 years of the study showed an increase in antibiotic resistance that coincided with obstetric group b streptococcus antepartum antibiotic prophylaxis. group b streptococcus declined from 41 to 4 cases from the first to the last period. late-onset bsi increased from 111 to 230 cases from the first to the second 6-year study period and declined modestly (171 cases) during the last. fifteen percent (78 cases) of late-onset bsi were caused by egnb, 5% by other gram-negative bacilli, 67% primarily by coagulase-negative staphylococcus, and 13% by fungus. nonspecific clinical and hematologic signs of late-onset bsi were  similar across egnb species, but necrotizing enterocolitis was often associated with e coli, whereas pneumonia and prolonged thrombocytopenia characterized k pneumoniae infections. no outbreaks or epidemics were observed, and strains of egnb with evidence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase production were never isolated. conclusion: antepartum antibiotic prophylaxis may have increased antibiotic resistance in e coli isolates from early-onset bsi but has dramatically decreased group b streptococcus infections. late-onset bsi caused by egnb increased, but without changes in antibiotic susceptibility. in spite of medical advances, e coli, k pneumoniae, and e cloacae remain responsible for significant morbidity and mortality, especially in very low birth weight infants.

TI  == [bact-alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. first argentine multicentre study].
AB  == bact-alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. first argentine multicentre study. between january and december 2001, we analyzed 80,141 blood cultures by the bact-alert system (14,960 fan aerobics, 3,855 fan anaerobic, 11,114 standards aerobics, 11,367 standards anaerobic, 12,054 pediatrics and 26,791 fan pediatrics bottles) and 44.235 series from 27.615 patients at eight hospitals of buenos aires city, one of la plata city and three  of the buenos aires province. a total of 13,657 blood cultures yielded a positive result. only 181 of them had been detected as positive between the 5th and 7th day of incubation and only 26 (0.19%) had clinical significance (staphylococcus aureus 3; coagulase negative staphylococci 2; enterococcus faecalis 1; streptococcus pneumoniae 2; campylobacter spp 1; escherichia coli 1; enterobacter cloacae 1; enterobacteraerogenes 1; citrobacter freundii 1; klebsiella pneumoniae 1; proteus mirabilis 1; serratia marcescens 4; yeasts 7, including one strain of  cryptococcus neoformans). of the total of contaminants, 38% were isolated by the  anaerobic standard (65% were propionibacterium spp and 29% coagulase negative staphylococci), 31.2% by the fan aerobic (33.3% difphteroids and 28.9% bacillus spp), 11.8% by the pediatric, 9% by fan pediatric, 8.33% by aerobic standard and  1.4% by fan anaerobic bottle. our results show that the prolonged incubation of blood cultures for more than 5 days using the bact-alert system is unnecessary.

TI  == rates of antimicrobial resistance among common bacterial pathogens causing respiratory, blood, urine, and skin and soft tissue infections in pediatric patients.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance patterns among the principal bacterial pathogens from infections of the respiratory tract, blood, skin and soft tissue, and urinary tract of pediatric patients from the usa, canada, germany, france, and italy were studied using the the surveillance network (tsn) database. among streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from respiratory tract infections, the prevalence of high-level penicillin resistance (mic>/=2 microg/ml) ranged from 1.1 (italy) to 36.2% (usa); erythromycin resistance was higher, ranging from 13.4 (germany) to 63.8% (france). the prevalence of beta-lactamase-positive haemophilus influenzae  among isolates from lower respiratory tract infections ranged from <10 (italy and germany) to 38.4% (usa). among isolates from blood and skin and soft tissue infections, the prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa)  ranged from 7.2% (canada and germany) to 27.3% (italy). the prevalence of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae with putative extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among isolates from blood, urinary tract, and skin and soft tissue infections ranged from 0 (germany and france) to 29.6% (italy). with the exception of pseudomonal infections or infections with mrsa, amoxicillin-clavulanate retained moderate activity, whilst ceftriaxone and cefepime were the most effective broad-spectrum injectable agents. meropenem was  the most effective agent against pseudomonas aeruginosa with <5% resistance. low  levels of resistance, along with acceptable safety profiles and the availability  of convenient oral formulations, continue to support the use of ceftriaxone, cefepime, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and meropenem as viable options for the treatment of infections in pediatric patients.

TI  == prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from blood cultures of hospitalized patients in the united states in 2002.
AB  == background: bloodstream infections are associated with significant patient morbidity and mortality. antimicrobial susceptibility patterns should guide the choice of empiric antimicrobial regimens for patients with bacteremia. methods: from january to december of 2002, 82,569 bacterial blood culture isolates were reported to the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa by 268 laboratories. susceptibility to relevant antibiotic compounds was analyzed using national committee for clinical laboratory standards guidelines. results: coagulase-negative staphylococci (42.0%), staphylococcus aureus (16.5%), enterococcus faecalis (8.3%), escherichia coli (7.2%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3.6%), and enterococcus faecium (3.5%) were the most frequently isolated bacteria from blood cultures, collectively accounting for >80% of isolates. in vitro susceptibility to expanded-spectrum beta-lactams such as ceftriaxone were high for oxacillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (98.7%), oxacillin-susceptible s. aureus (99.8%), e. coli (97.3%), k. pneumoniae (93.3%),  and streptococcus pneumoniae (97.2%). susceptibilities to fluoroquinolones were variable for k. pneumoniae (90.3-91.4%), e. coli (86.0-86.7%), oxacillin-susceptible s. aureus (84.0-89.4%), oxacillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (72.7-82.7%), e. faecalis (52.1%), and e. faecium (11.3%). combinations of antimicrobials are often prescribed as empiric therapy for bacteremia. susceptibilities of all blood culture isolates to one or  both agents in combinations of ceftriaxone, ceftazdime, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam or ciprofloxacin plus gentamicin were consistent (range,  74.8-76.3%) but lower than similar beta-lactam or ciprofloxacin combinations with vancomycin (range, 93.5-96.6%). conclusion: ongoing surveillance for antimicrobial susceptibility remains essential, and will enhance efforts to identify resistance and attempt to limit its spread.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of the pathogens of bacteraemia in the uk and ireland 2001-2002: the bsac bacteraemia resistance surveillance programme.
AB  == objectives: to describe the current patterns of antimicrobial resistance in the major pathogens of bacteraemia in the uk and ireland, to highlight any unexpected resistance patterns and to act as a reference baseline for future studies. methods: in 2001 and 2002, 5092 blood culture isolates were collected by 29 laboratories distributed across the uk and ireland. a single central laboratory re-identified the isolates and measured mics by the bsac agar dilution method. results: oxacillin resistance was found in 42% of staphylococcus aureus and 76% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. streptococci were generally susceptible to beta-lactams, but tetracycline resistance was common (except in streptococcus pneumoniae) and particularly common among group b isolates (82% resistant). nine  percent of s. pneumoniae had reduced susceptibility to penicillin (mics 0.12-1 mg/l), but none required >/=2 mg/l for inhibition. high-level gentamicin resistance was seen in 43% of enterococcus faecalis, often in combination with raised ciprofloxacin mics (>/=32 mg/l), but these isolates remained susceptible to ampicillin and imipenem. only linezolid and tigecycline showed in vitro potency against a large proportion of enterococcus faecium. vancomycin resistance was restricted to enterococci (20% of e. faecium, 3% of e. faecalis) and a single isolate of coagulase-negative staphylococci (0.2%, mic of 8 mg/l). escherichia coli isolates were commonly resistant to amoxicillin (56%) and tetracycline (88%) but remained susceptible to ceftazidime, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in 2% of e. coli (none in 2001, 3.2% in 2002), 5% of klebsiella spp. and 8% of enterobacter spp. resistance rates of pseudomonas aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, gentamicin, imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam were between 4% and 7%. among the newly licensed and developmental agents, there was no resistance to linezolid in gram-positive organisms. ertapenem had a wide spectrum, covering enterobacteriaceae, streptococci and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci. mics of tigecycline were low for gram-positive species and enterobacteriaceae except proteeae and enterobacter spp. conclusion: antimicrobial resistance among major bloodstream pathogens to those antimicrobials often selected for empirical therapy was relatively uncommon in 2001-2002, usually <10%. an important exception was oxacillin resistance in s. aureus.

TI  == use of florfenicol in non-human primates.
AB  == studies were undertaken to determine if florfenicol, an antimicrobial agent structurally similar to chloramphenicol, could be used as an effective broad spectrum antibiotic for the treatment of bacterial infections in primates. florfenicol was developed as an injectable antibiotic for use in cattle on an every other day dosing schedule. its broad spectrum activity, long duration of action following i.m. administration, and its safety as compared with chloramphenicol made it an attractive antibiotic for use in non-human primates. previous studies had shown that florfenicol is effective against common primate pathogens such as salmonella, klebsiella, escherichia coli, bordetella bronchiseptica, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus spp., and yersinia pseudotuberculosis. we performed experiments on a total of 15 macaques. the animals were given florfenicol at 50 mg/kg i.m. and blood samples taken at various time points. serum was evaluated for florfenicol absorption. necropsies were also performed to determine if major organs were affected and to determine the effects of i.m. injection of florfenicol. we determined that florfenicol given every 48 hours in rhesus macaques results in blood levels that were acceptable for therapeutic use. the effect on muscle tissue of i.m. injection was similar to ketamine and normal saline. there were no gross lesions observed and no changes with tissues submitted for histology. our work shows that with further studies, florfenicol may be useful when injectable antibiotic therapy is required in non-human primates.

TI  == management of postirradiation infection: lessons learned from animal models.
AB  == ionizing radiation depresses host defenses and enhances susceptibility to local and systemic infection due to endogenous or exogenous microorganisms. exposure of mice to a lethal dose of ionizing 60co-gamma radiation induces a dose-related reduction in the number of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 10(10-12) to  10(4-6) per gram of stool within 4 days. the number of anaerobic bacteria stays low, but the number of enterobacteriaceae per gram of stool increases significantly up to 10(9) by the 12th day after irradiation. this increase is associated with bacterial translocation of these organisms and fatal bacteremia.  the use of quinolones in the irradiated animals was effective in controlling systemic endogenous gram-negative infection after irradiation. supplementation with penicillin prevented treatment failures due to streptococcus spp. and increased survival. quinolones given for 21 days also were effective in management of systemic exogenous infections due to orally ingested klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. effectiveness of quinolones may be attributed to inhibition of exogenous organism growth within the gut lumen while  preserving the anaerobic gut flora as well as their systemic antibacterial activity. based on these findings, antimicrobial agents recommended for therapy of infection after exposure to irradiation are: ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, gentamicin +/- amoxicillin, or vancomycin.

AB  == three doses of moxifloxacin 400 mg qd were administered orally to 20 candidates for knee arthroscopy (mean age, 71.2 years). the procedure was scheduled at four  different points of time after the last dose: 2, 6, 12, and 24 h. five patients were studied at each point of time. drug levels were determined by the bioassay method. bactericidal activity against four bacterial pathogens (two strains of each) was studied on serum and synovial fluid samples obtained during arthroscopy using the nccls guidelines. mean (+/-s.d.) peak serum and synovial fluid concentrations were 3.46 +/- 0.78 mg/l and 3.42 +/- 0.51 mg/l, respectively. levels above 1.0 mg/l were detected as long as 24 h. the peak bactericidal titers were (in serum and synovial fluid, respectively) 1:18.3 and 1:32 against staphylococcus aureus, 1:18.3 and 1:22.6 against streptococcus pyogenes, 1:45.2 and 1:64.0 against klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1:2.3 and 1:1.7 against pseudomonas aeruginosa. bactericidal titers >1:2 were documented against the first three pathogens up to 24 h after dosing. on the basis of its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, moxifloxacin seems to be an excellent candidate  for the treatment of joint infections, except those caused by p. aeruginosa.

TI  == comparative study of the in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, abt-492.
AB  == objectives: the in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, abt-492, was determined. methods: mics were compared with those of two beta-lactams, telithromycin, ciprofloxacin and four later generation fluoroquinolones. the effects of human serum and of inoculum concentration were also investigated. results: mic data indicate that abt-492 has potent activity against gram-positive organisms with enhanced anti-staphylococcal activity compared with earlier fluoroquinolones, in addition to activity against beta-haemolytic streptococci, pneumococci including penicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococcus faecalis but not enterococcus  faecium. abt-492 was the most active agent tested against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria meningitidis, fluoroquinolone-susceptible neisseria gonorrhoeae and anaerobes. good activity was observed for abt-492 amongst the enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes tested, but ciprofloxacin showed superior activity for species of proteus, morganella and providencia, as well as  for pseudomonas spp. in common with the other fluoroquinolones tested, organisms  with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin had raised mic(90)s to abt-492. the  one isolate of h. influenzae tested with reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility had an abt-492 mic close to that of the population lacking a mechanism of quinolone resistance. abt-492 was more active than ciprofloxacin against chlamydia spp. an inoculum effect was observed with a number of isolates of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, e. faecium, klebsiella spp. and  escherichia coli, in addition to moderately raised mics in the presence of 70% serum protein. the clinical significance of these findings is yet to be determined. conclusions: abt-492 is a new fluoroquinolone with excellent activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, with many potential clinical uses.

AB  == antimicrobial resistance in hospital and community settings is growing at an alarming rate and has been attributed to such organisms as methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus, staphylococci with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, multi-drug resistant pseudomonas spp., klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp, and acinetobacter spp., as well as streptococcus pneumoniae with decreased susceptibility to penicillin and other antibacterials. to address the need for new therapies to combat resistant organisms, drug companies are refocusing their discovery efforts on developing novel agents with new mechanisms of action. the hope is that rapidly emerging technologies including combinatorial chemistry, high throughput screening, proteomics and microbial genomics will have a positive impact on antimicrobial drug discovery. these technologies should aid in the identification of novel drug targets and compounds with unique mechanisms of action other than those currently provided by the traditional antibiotics. nucleosides are one class of compounds worthy of further investigation as antibacterials since some derivatives have shown moderate to good activity against specific bacterial strains. for example,  5'-peptidyl nucleoside derivatives can inhibit peptide deformylase, an enzyme essential for bacterial survival that is not vital to human cells. this review also includes a list of miscellaneous nucleosides that have been synthesized as potential antibacterials. more detailed investigations on structure, as it relates to the antimicrobial activity of the various classes of nucleosides, need to be conducted in order to maximize the potential of developing a potent nucleoside for the treatment of bacterial infections. this review begins with an  introduction to terms followed by discussions regarding the general background and relevance for developing novel antimicrobial agents. challenges facing the antimicrobial drug discovery process are discussed along with relevant drug targets. an overview of nucleoside chemistry as it relates to antimicrobial activity is presented, followed by a discussion of the evidence which supports the potential of this class of compounds to yield the novel antimicrobial therapies needed in the new millennium.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of common bacterial pathogens isolated from a new regional hospital in southern taiwan.
AB  == background: antimicrobial resistance has become a major health problem in taiwan. while some trends in antimicrobial resistance are universal, others appear to be  unique for specific regions. methods: to determine the distribution and antimicrobial drug resistance of bacterial pathogens in a new hospital in southern taiwan, surveillance data on major bacterial pathogens isolated from chang gung memorial hospital at chia-yi from january 2002 through december 2002 were retrospectively analyzed. results: the most common gram-positive isolate was staphylococcus aureus. escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were the two most common gram negative isolates. pseudomonas aeruginosa ranked the first among gram-negative, glucose non-fermenting isolates, followed in the order of frequency by acinetobacter baumannii. oxacillin resistance rate of s. aureus was  58%, while vancomycin and teicoplanin remained effective against all of the isolates. the penicillin non-susceptibility rate of streptococcus pneumoniae was  52%, and it is notable that the rate of resistance to erythromycin was 87%. resistance to various antimicrobial agents for p. aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila, and gram-negative enteric bacilli was very common in our study. infections caused by multidrug-resistant a. baumannii was not uncommon in this hospital but fortunately, imipenem resistant a. baumannii was rarely encountered. antimicrobial resistance was common in nontyphoid salmonella, s. choleraesuis and serogroup b isolates in particular. conclusion: the high rates of antimicrobial resistance among these major bacterial pathogens in this new hospital are impressive and alarming. judicious use of antimicrobial agents can never be overemphasized. continued surveillance of the changes of resistance patterns over time is necessary.

TI  == neonatal sepsis and meningitis in haiti.
AB  == the aim of the study was to determine the etiology of meningitis and sepsis in the newborn at the state university hospital of haiti and evaluate the susceptibility 'in vitro' of the pathogens to the antibiotics commonly used. this was a prospective case series study over a 10-month period (may 1997-february 1998) of 42 newborns with sepsis and/or meningitis. besides the clinical signs, a positive blood culture and/or a positive culture of cerebrospinal fluid was present in each case. gram-negative bacteria were most commonly found as a cause  of early onset sepsis, with enterobacter aerogenes as the most common agent. there were no such difference between gram-negative and gram-positive in late onset sepsis. group b streptococcus was associated with neonatal meningitis (44 per cent of cases) which was more related to gram-positive bacteria (66 per cent). risk factors were vaginal discharge and dysuria in mothers, and low apgar  score in newborns. thirty-three per cent of the pathogens found, among them klebsiella pneumoniae, were resistant 'in vitro' to ampicillin and gentamycin. all were susceptible to amikacin. enterobacter aerogenes is an important pathogen in the etiology of early onset sepsis in the newborn at the state university hospital of haiti, while group b streptococcus is the leading cause of meningitis in that age group. resistance to gentamycin should be taken into consideration for the treatment of sepsis and meningitis in the newborn.

TI  == comparison of the microbicidal and muramidase activities of mouse lysozyme m and  p.
AB  == lysozyme is one of the most abundant antimicrobial proteins in the airspaces of the lung. mice express two lysozyme genes, lysozyme m and p, but only the m enzyme is detected in abundance in lung tissues. disruption of the lysozyme m locus significantly increased bacterial burden and mortality following intratracheal infection with a gram-negative bacterium. unexpectedly, significant lysozyme enzyme activity (muramidase activity) was detected in the airspaces of uninfected lysozyme m-/- mice, amounting to 25% of the activity in wild-type mice. muramidase activity in lysozyme m-/- mice was associated with increased lysozyme p mrna and protein in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid respectively. the muramidase activity of recombinant lysozyme p was less than that of recombinant m lysozyme. recombinant p lysozyme was also less effective in killing selected gram-negative bacteria, requiring higher concentrations than lysozyme m to achieve the same level of killing. the lower antimicrobial activity of p lysozyme, coupled with incomplete compensation by p lysozyme in lysozyme m-/- mice, probably accounts for the increased susceptibility of null mice to infection. recombinant lysozyme m and p were equally effective in killing selected gram-positive organisms. this outcome suggests that disruption of both m and p loci would significantly increase susceptibility to airway infections, particularly those associated with colonization by gram-positive organisms.

TI  == bacteriology of mastoid subperiosteal abscess in children.
AB  == objective: subperiosteal abscess (sa) is the most frequent complication of acute  mastoiditis (am). of pathogens cultured from the external auditory canal or middle ear during myringotomy, 15% may be different from microorganisms isolated  from the sa. we suggest, therefore, that only cultures obtained from the abscess  cavity can truly reflect the bacteriology of this complication of am. the purpose of our study was to analyze the infectious agents which cause sa and mastoid cortex erosion in children. material and methods: the medical records of 35 children who underwent mastoidectomy for sa between may 1984 and april 2002 were  evaluated. results: mastoid cortex erosion was found at surgery in 72.7% of abscesses purulent discharge was obtained from the sa cavity in 28 cases. the commonest pathogens isolated in these cases, as well as in 18 cases of mastoid cortex erosion, were staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, followed by streptococcus pneumoniae. hemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. sterile culture was found in 25% of cases. conclusions: mastoid sa is a unilateral disease that can recur. early administration of anti-staphylococcus medications should be considered for patients with sa as a complication of am.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  == the ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. these pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. these infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer  generations of antibiotics. in this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis  and endophthalmitis. the ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis. mic90 values for the drugs  against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/ml to 0.57 mg/ml and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. the mic90 for gatifloxacin against streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/ml compared with 0.73 mg/ml for moxifloxacin (p = .011). among the gram-negative isolates, the mean mic90 for gatifloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/ml compared with 2.60 mg/ ml for moxifloxacin (p = .023).  mic90 values for gatifloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. for the atypicals, the mic90 values for gatifloxacin against nocardia asteroides and mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.

TI  == role of toll-like receptor 4 in gram-positive and gram-negative pneumonia in mice.
AB  == to determine the role of toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4) in the immune response to pneumonia, c3h/hej mice (which display a mutant nonfunctional tlr4) and c3h/hen wild-type mice were intranasally infected with either streptococcus pneumoniae (a common gram-positive respiratory pathogen) or klebsiella pneumoniae (a common gram-negative respiratory pathogen). in cases of pneumococcal pneumonia, tlr4 mutant mice showed a reduced survival only after infection with low-level bacterial doses, which was associated with a higher bacterial burden in their lungs 48 h postinfection. in klebsiella pneumonia, tlr4 mutant mice demonstrated  a shortened survival after infection with either a low- or a high-level bacterial dose together with an enhanced bacterial outgrowth in their lungs. these data suggest that tlr4 contributes to a protective immune response in both pneumococcal and klebsiella pneumonia and that its role is more important in respiratory tract infection caused by the latter (gram-negative) pathogen.

TI  == antibiotic consumption, bacterial resistance and their correlation in a swiss university hospital and its adult intensive care units.
AB  == ecological surveys of high-antibiotic use areas in the hospital should be used to evaluate patterns and trends in order to optimise antibiotic consumption and minimise resistance. we conducted a retrospective cohort study with the aim to examine trends in antimicrobial consumption and bacterial susceptibility at the geneva university hospital and its adult icus between 1996 and 2000. the average  annual consumption of antimicrobials was 400 d-defined doses (ddd)/1000 patient-d in the entire hospital, 462 in the surgical icu and 683 in the medical icu. in the medical icu, we observed a steady decrease of intravenous antimicrobial use,  whereas a 25% increase in the total antimicrobial consumption was noted in 1999 and 2000 for the entire hospital. the proportion of different bacterial species,  resistance rates and antibiotic consumption rates differed between the entire hospital and the icus, with moderate variation between y. possible relationships  between antibiotic consumption and resistance rates, expressed as ddd and as number of resistant isolates per 1000 patient-d respectively, were calculated for of the most frequently isolated bacteria (total 71 correlations). statistically significant positive correlations between antibiotic consumption and resistance were found in escherichia coli for piperacillin, in pseudomonas aeruginosa for piperacillin, cephalosporins and aminoglycosides, in klebsiella spp. for cephalosporin, in coagulase-negative staphylococci for gentamicin and in streptococcus pneumoniae for penicillin.

AB  == background: inappropriate use of antimicrobials is of special importance in the intensive treatment unit because of the large number of drugs prescribed, the chance for drug errors, and the likelihood of development of drug resistance. methods: a total of 297 records of patients admitted to the intensive treatment unit of the manipal teaching hospital, a tertiary care hospital in pokhara, western nepal, were studied to determine the prescribing frequency and rationality of use of antimicrobials. patient outcome, duration of stay in the intensive treatment unit, and the age and sex distribution of the patients were also studied. results: mean+/-sd drugs per patient was 3.4+/-1.8. about half (50.2%) of the patients received an antimicrobial; 84.6% of the antimicrobials were used without obtaining bacteriologic evidence of infection. the commonest organisms isolated on culture were pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus. a total of 28.9% of the antimicrobials were prescribed for lower respiratory tract infections on the basis of the putative site of infection; 61.9% of the antimicrobials were prescribed by the parenteral route and mainly the older generation of antimicrobials were used. in 39 of the 149 patients prescribed an antimicrobial,  the use was irrational. conclusions: prescriber education to improve prescribing  patterns and regular auditing of antimicrobial prescriptions to prevent their inappropriate use and unnecessary cost to the patients are required. the high percentage of inappropriate use of antimicrobials raises concerns about the development and spread of drug resistance, which must be addressed.

TI  == pharmacodynamics of the new des-f(6)-quinolone garenoxacin in a murine thigh infection model.
AB  == garenoxacin is a new des-f(6)-quinolone with broad-spectrum activity against both gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli. we used the neutropenic murine thigh infection model to characterize the time course of antimicrobial activity of garenoxacin and determine which pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (pk-pd) parameter best correlated with efficacy. serum drug levels following three fourfold-escalating single-dose levels of garenoxacin were measured by microbiologic assay. in vivo postantibiotic effects (paes) were determined after  doses of 16 and 64 mg/kg of body weight. mice had 10(6.5) to 10(6.7) cfu of streptococcus pneumoniae strain atcc 10813 or staphylococcus aureus strain atcc 33591 per thigh when they were treated for 24 h with garenoxacin at a dose of 4 to 128 mg/kg/day fractionated for 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-hour dosing regimens. nonlinear regression analysis was used to determine which pk-pd parameter best correlated with the measurement of cfu/thigh at 24 h. pharmacokinetic studies yielded peak/dose values of 0.2 to 0.3, area under the concentration-time curve (auc)/dose values of 0.1 to 0.5, and half-lives of 0.7 to 1.6 h. garenoxacin produced in vivo paes of 1.4 to 8.2 h with s. pneumoniae atcc 10813, 7.6 to >12.4 h with s. aureus atcc 25923, and 0 to 1.5 h with klebsiella pneumoniae atcc 43816. the 24-h auc/mic ratio was the pk-pd parameter that best correlated with efficacy (r2=71 to 90% for the two organisms compared with 43 to 56% for the peak/mic ratio and 47 to 75% for percent time above the mic [% t>mic]). in subsequent studies we used the neutropenic murine thigh infection model to determine if the magnitude of the auc/mic ratio needed for efficacy of garenoxacin varied among pathogens (including resistant strains). mice had 10(5.9) to 10(7.2) cfu of 6 strains of s. aureus (2 methicillin resistant), 11 strains of s. pneumoniae (5 penicillin susceptible, 1 penicillin intermediate, and 5 penicillin resistant, and of the resistant strains, 3 were also ciprofloxacin resistant), and 4 gram-negative strains per thigh when treated for  24 h with 1 to 64 mg of garenoxacin per kg every 12 h. a sigmoid dose-response model was used to estimate the doses (mg/kg/24 h) required to achieve a net bacteriostatic effect over 24 h. mics ranged from 0.008 to 4 microg/ml. the free  drug 24-h auc/mic ratios for each static dose (2.8 to 128 mg/kg/day) varied from  8.2 to 145. the mean 24-h auc/mic ratios +/- standard deviations for s. pneumoniae, s. aureus, and gram-negative strains were 33 +/- 18, 81 +/- 37, and 33 +/- 30, respectively. methicillin, penicillin, or ciprofloxacin resistance did not alter the magnitude of the auc/mic ratio required for efficacy.

TI  == composition and antimicrobial activity of achillea clavennae l. essential oil.
AB  == the volatile constituents of achillea clavennae l. (asteraceae), rare plant of europe, have been analysed using gc/ms. twenty- five components making up 81.6% of the oil were characterized with camphor (29.5%), myrcene (5.5%), 1,8-cineole (5.3%), beta-caryophyllene (5.1%) and linalool (4.9%) being the major constituents. the essential oil was evaluated for antibacterial and antifungal activities. the screening of the antimicrobial activity of essential oil was conducted by a disc diffusion test against gram-positive (bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis), gram-negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis) and fungal organisms (aspergillus niger, aspergillus fumigatus, candida albicans). the activity was more pronounced against gram-negative and fungal organisms than against gram-positive bacteria. a. clavennae oil was found  to possess antimicrobial activity against klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and all fungal organisms.

TI  == thrombomodulin mutant mice with a strongly reduced capacity to generate activated protein c have an unaltered pulmonary immune response to respiratory pathogens and lipopolysaccharide.
AB  == the thrombomodulin-protein c-protein s (tm-pc-ps) pathway exerts anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory effects. we investigated the role of tm in the pulmonary immune response in vivo by the use of mice with a mutation in the tm gene (tm(pro/pro)) that was earlier found to result in a minimal capacity for activated pc (apc) generation in the circulation. we here demonstrate that tm(pro/pro) mice also display a strongly reduced capacity to produce apc in the alveolar compartment upon intrapulmonary delivery of pc and thrombin. we monitored procoagulant and inflammatory changes in the lung during gram-positive  (streptococcus pneumoniae) and gram-negative (klebsiella pneumoniae) pneumonia and after local administration of lipopolysaccharide (lps). bacterial pneumonia was associated with fibrin(ogen) depositions in the lung that colocalized with inflammatory infiltrates. lps also induced a rise in thrombin-antithrombin complexes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. these pulmonary procoagulant responses were unaltered in tm(pro/pro) mice, except for enhanced fibrin(ogen) deposition during pneumococcal pneumonia. in addition, tm(pro/pro) mice displayed unchanged  antibacterial defense, neutrophil recruitment, and cytokine/chemokine levels. these data suggest that the capacity of tm to generate apc does not play a role of importance in the pulmonary response to respiratory pathogens or lps.

TI  == bacteremia in hematological and oncological children with febrile neutropenia: experience in a tertiary medical center in taiwan.
AB  == a retrospective study of bacteremia in children with febrile neutropenia admitted to a medical center in taiwan from january 1999 to december 1999 was performed. there were 190 episodes of febrile neutropenia during this period and 46 pathogens were isolated from blood specimens in 38 bacteremic episodes (7 mixed infections). pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.4%), staphylococcus aureus (10.9%), klebsiella pneumoniae (10.9%), and enterobacter cloacae (10.9%) were the most common isolates. three of the 5 isolates of s. aureus were resistant to methicillin. twenty-three episodes of bacteremia (four mixed infections) were associated with recent antibiotic use. of the 23 bacteremic episodes with recent  antibiotic use, p. aeruginosa (20%), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (10%), k. pneumoniae (10%), escherichia coli (10%), and e. cloacae (10%) were isolated most often. relapsed leukemia (odds ratio 3, 95% confidence interval 1.4-6.5) and recent antibiotic therapy (odds ratio 3.4, 95% confidence interval 1.7-7.7) were  the independent risk factors of bacteremia. there were 9 mortality cases in patients with bacteremia, including 4 cases with mixed infections, and 5 cases with p. aeruginosa, e. coli, klebsiella oxytoca, s. aureus, and streptococcus mitis, respectively. broad-spectrum antibiotics were necessary in febrile neutropenic children because of the high percentage of mixed infection.

TI  == susceptibility trends in bacteraemias: analyses of 7544 patient-unique bacteraemic episodes spanning 11 years (1990-2000).
AB  == the aim of the present study was to design more accurate tools for the selection  of appropriate antimicrobial therapy for hospitalized patients with suspected sepsis. we created a large database comprising data on all patient-unique blood cultures obtained over an 11 year period (1 january, 1990 through 31 december, 2000). improved statistical tools were applied to assess the trends in in vitro activity of individual antibiotic agents against various bacteria over time, and  to calculate susceptibility rates of subsets of organisms. during the 11 year study period, 173571 blood cultures were obtained, of which 17703 (10.2%) were positive, with 7544 patient-unique blood cultures (4.3%). the mean annual number  of positive, patient-unique cultures was 686 (standard deviation=79). the 10 most frequently isolated organisms were: escherichia coli (1494), staphylococcus aureus (1240), klebsiella pneumoniae (779), enterococcus spp. (631), pseudomonas  aeruginosa (488), streptococcus pneumoniae (447), enterobacter spp. (338), acinetobacter spp. (298), proteus mirabilis (260) and candida spp. (254). no significant change was detected in the annual rates (means, standard deviations)  per 1000 admissions of these organisms: the highest was e. coli (5.5, 1), the lowest was candida (1, 0.3). forty percent of organisms (n=2943) were obtained from patients in the emergency department (ed), 23% (1744) in medical departments, 15% (1134) in paediatric units, 13% (998) on surgical wards and 9% (709) in intensive care units (icus). trend statistical analysis revealed a significant decrease in susceptibility in ed enterobacteriaceae to eight of 15 (53%) tested antimicrobials, with a mean annual decrease of 1.6%+/-0.6%, in the icu isolates, a significant decrease was detected in only five (33%) of the tested antimicrobials, with a mean annual decrease of 2.5%+/-1.3%. the difference in susceptibility between ed and icu isolates was significant for all antimicrobials (p<0.001). a significant decrease in the susceptibility of e coli  to nine of 15 drugs (60%) was detected, ranging from 0.7% to 2.7% annually. in k. pneumoniae a significant decrease in susceptibility of k. pneumoniae was detected with only two agents. pseudomonas spp. isolates remained highly sensitive to all  traditional anti-pseudomonal agents, without significant decay in sensitivity rates over time. susceptibility of s. aureus to methicillin decreased significantly for several subsets of patients (p<0.001). marked differences in susceptibility rates between the departments were detected. trend statistical analyses, when appropriately applied to multi-year databases of microbial susceptibilities, may yield susceptibility tables that are significantly more accurate than traditional semi-annual or annual tables.

TI  == bacteriological status of canine milk and septicaemia in neonatal puppies--a retrospective study.
AB  == results of the bacteriological examination of milk samples from 46 bitches were evaluated retrospectively, and correlated with findings of the bacteriological examination of organs from dead, septicaemic puppies in their litters (n = 33). the aim of this study was to investigate, in how many cases of clinical and subclinical mastitis of the bitches, the same bacteria can be detected in their septicaemic neonates. one group of lactating bitches was clinically healthy (group i, n = 38), whereas in eight bitches different puerperal disorders were found (group ii). twenty-five septicaemic puppies were from group i, eight from group ii. out of a broad spectrum of bacteria isolated from the milk of clinically healthy and diseased bitches, only escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and/or ss-haemolytic (haem.) streptococcus sp. could be isolated from  organs of their septicaemic puppies. this was the case in three bitches with mastitis and in one clinically healthy bitch only. staphylococcus intermedius, although frequently isolated from canine milk, does not seem to be a cause of septicaemia in neonates. it is assumed that in most cases of neonate septicaemia, bacteria from the bitches' milk are not the primary cause.

TI  == bacterial polysaccharides as vaccines--immunity and chemical characterization.
AB  == studies on protective immunity and biochemical characterization of bacterial capsular polysaccharides have led to significant contributions to understanding of the mechanisms of infectious diseases and development of effective vaccines. immunity to encapsulated bacteria is related to antibody response to polysaccharide (ps) antigen, interactions with t- and b-lymphocytes, and host defense mechanisms. meningococcal, pneumococcal and salmonella vi pss and haemophilus type b ps-protein conjugate vaccines have been licensed and provided  effective immunity for prevention of these bacterial infections. capsular pss are cell-surface polymers consisting of oligosaccharide repeating units. many pss are highly polar and hydrophilic and interfere with cell-to-cell interactions with phagocytes. most pneumococcal pss are negatively charged and possess acidic components such as d-glucuronic acid and phosphate in phosphodiester bonds. extensive immunologic cross-reactivity has been observed among bacterial capsular pss. in infants the antibody responses to most capsular pss are generally poor. enhanced immunogenicity of ps antigens can be achieved through ps-protein conjugate vaccines, immunization during a critical period of perinatal development and effective antigen delivery system.

TI  == amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium extended release tablets: a new antimicrobial for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis and community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == community-acquired bacterial respiratory tract infections are among the most common health disorders requiring medical care and are associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and direct and indirect costs. recent increases in the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance have resulted in reduced susceptibility of the most common respiratory tract bacterial pathogens to a number of antimicrobials. amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium extended release (er) tablets (augmentin xr, glaxosmithkline) is a new formulation of amoxicillin/clavulanate that retains activity against betalactamase-producing organisms whilst increasing the activity against streptococcus pneumoniae through elevated and sustained plasma amoxicillin concentrations. the bilayer tablet provides immediate release of clavulanate and both immediate and sustained release of amoxicillin to maintain therapeutic concentrations of amoxicillin over longer periods of the dosing interval. in clinical trials of acute bacterial sinusitis (abs) and community-acquired pneumonia (cap), amoxicillin/clavulanate er was shown to have excellent bacteriological and clinical success rates, even in patients infected with antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, and was found to be  generally well tolerated. amoxicillin/clavulanate er is approved in the us for the treatment of patients with abs or cap caused by beta-lactamase-producing pathogens (ie, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, or methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus  aureus) and s. pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility to penicillin (penicillin minimum inhibitory concentration = 2.0 microg/ml).

TI  == bacterial pathogens and outcome determinants of childhood pyogenic meningitis in  ilorin, nigeria.
AB  == empirical antimicrobial therapy remainsjustifiable in childhood pyogenic meningitis (cpm), but the continuing efficacy in a particular setting requires periodic microbiological surveillance. it was this need that informed the present five-year retrospective study of consecutive admissions for cpm at the emergency  paediatric unit (epu) of the university of ilorin teaching hospital, ilorin, nigeria. of the 71 cerebro-spinal fluid [csf] analyses, 41 (57.6%) were gram-smear positive (gsp). gram-positive cocci (gpc) were identified in 23 (56.1%) smears, while 14 (34.2.%) had gram-negative bacilli (gnb). only three (7.3%) had gram-negative diplococci (gnd). despite corroborative biochemical findings, the remaining 30 (42.3%), including two with tuberculous meningitis proved smear-negative. gpc cases had a mean age of 4.49 +/- 5.3yrs, gnb, 3.06 +/- 4.8yrs and gnd, 4.47 +/- 4.9yrs. csf isolates were made in 28 (39.4%) cases. streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for a predominant 22 (78.6%) (p = 0.00), haemophilus influenzae for 2 (7.1%), and neisseria meningitidis for only 1 (3.5%) case. whereas strept. pneumoniae and h. influenzae isolates were uniformly sensitive to each of sultamicillin, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, 7.7% of strept. pneumoniae were resistant to crystalline penicillin, 6.7% to ampicillin, and 69.2% to chloramphenicol; one of the two h. influenzae isolates was chloramphenicol-resistant. amongst the 30 (42.3%) fatal cases, the length of  stay was significantly shorter in gnb-positive cases (p = 0.045). mortality was significantly higher amongst cases with purulent/turbid csf at admission (p = 0.03), and in those with csf protein of >150mg/dl (p = 0.02) and glucose <1mg/dl  (p = 0.047). the present aetiological preponderance of gpc and strept. pneumoniae in our study population, the high case-fatality, and the emerging resistance profile suggest the need for exploring additional control options including vaccination. we emphasize the need for periodic auditing of local antimicrobial policies in cpm.

TI  == levofloxacin pharmacokinetics in esrd and removal by the cellulose acetate high performance-210 hemodialyzer.
AB  == background: no published data are available describing the pharmacokinetics of intravenous levofloxacin in patients with end-stage renal disease (esrd). objectives of this study are to determine the pharmacokinetics and dialytic clearance of levofloxacin and develop dosing strategies in these patients. methods: eight noninfected subjects receiving long-term thrice-weekly hemodialysis, with no measurable residual renal function, were administered intravenous levofloxacin, 250 mg, over 1 hour after a scheduled hemodialysis session. blood samples were collected serially during the interdialytic period, during the next intradialytic period, and immediately after the next hemodialysis session. serum concentrations of levofloxacin were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. differential equations describing a 2-compartment open-infusion pharmacokinetic model were fit to each individual subject's serum concentration-time data by iterative nonlinear weighted least-squares regression  analysis using adapt ii (biomedical simulations resource, university of southern  california, los angeles, ca). ratios of maximum serum concentration (c(max)) to minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) were calculated for common respiratory pathogens by using mic for 90% of isolates (mic90) data from published studies. results: all subjects completed the study, and no adverse events were reported. median systemic clearance, volume of distribution at steady state, elimination half-life, and c(max) were 37.0 ml/min (range, 12.8 to 42.7 ml/min), 103.3 l (range, 39.8 to 139.3 l), 34.4 hours (range, 28.4 to 39.3 hours), and 5.2 microg/ml (range, 4.1 to 11.3 microg/ml), respectively. median dialytic clearance and levofloxacin reduction ratios were 84.4 ml/min (range, 61.8 to 107.6 ml/min)  and 0.244 (range, 0.181 to 0.412), respectively. median c(max)-mic90 ratios were  10 or greater for haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, enterobacter cloacae, and klebsiella pneumoniae, approximately 5 for streptococcus pneumoniae, and less than 1 for pseudomonas aeruginosa. conclusion: the administration of levofloxacin to patients with esrd as 500 mg initially, followed by 250 mg every  48 hours, will provide adequate c(max)-mic ratios after the first and subsequent  doses for most patients with respiratory tract infections caused by organisms with levofloxacin mics of 1 microg/ml or less.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of three fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates by e test.
AB  == the in vitro susceptibility of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against several gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates was tested by e test. we found that the mic(50) and mic(90) values against all members of the enterobacteriaceae family except serratia were <0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin (mic range 0.006-32 mg/l) based on the in vitro susceptibility data. the susceptibility rates for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more than 85% for escherichia coli, citrobacter, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae, although serratia and acinetobacter exhibited more or  less similar susceptibility rates (about 80%). pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance to fluoroquinolones (mic(90) >32 mg/l) and decreased bactericidal rates (<65%) to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. respiratory pathogens such as streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae were highly susceptible (100%) to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. the ineffectiveness of fluoroquinolones for treating coagulase-positive staphylococcus aureus was demonstrated by poor in vitro susceptibility rates with levofloxacin (52%) and moxifloxacin (57%). coagulase-negative staphylococci demonstrated significantly decreased bactericidal rates to levofloxacin (21%), while the in vitro susceptibility to moxifloxacin was higher (66%) than that to levofloxacin. we propose that the beneficial effect of inclusion of any of these  three fluoroquinolones in treating enterococcus infections is marginal, as demonstrated by significantly reduced susceptibility rates (<32%). these data demonstrate the utility of fluoroquinoles to treat several gram-negative bacterial infections (with the exception of acinetobacter and p. aeruginosa), as  well as s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae.

AB  == sm-197436, sm-232721, and sm-232724 are new 1beta-methylcarbapenems with a unique 4-substituted thiazol-2-ylthio moiety at the c-2 side chain. in agar dilution susceptibility testing these novel carbapenems were active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) with a mic(90) of </=4 micro g/ml. furthermore, sm-232724 showed strong bactericidal activity against mrsa, in contrast to linezolid, which was bacteriostatic up to four times the mic. sm-232724 showed good therapeutic efficacy comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid against systemic infections of mrsa in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. the mics of sm-197436, sm-232721, and sm-232724 for streptococci, including penicillin-intermediate and  penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains, ranged from </=0.063 to 0.5 micro g/ml. these drugs were the most active beta-lactams tested against enterococcus faecium, and the mic(90) s for ampicillin-resistant e. faecium ranged between 8 and 16 micro g/ml, which were slightly higher than the value for linezolid. however, time-kill assays revealed the superior bactericidal activity  of sm-232724 compared to those of quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid against an e. faecium strain with a 4-log reduction in cfu at four times the mic after 24 h of exposure to antibiotics. in addition, sm-232724 significantly reduced the numbers of bacteria in a murine abscess model with the e. faecium strain: its efficacy was superior to that of linezolid, although the mics (2 micro g/ml) of these two agents are the same. among gram-negative bacteria, these three carbapenems were highly active against haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), moraxella catarrhalis, and bacteroides fragilis, and showed antibacterial activity equivalent to that of imipenem for escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus spp. thus, these new carbapenems are promising candidates for agents to treat nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, especially multiresistant gram-positive cocci, including mrsa and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.

AB  == background: cirrhotic patients are usually associated with a high susceptibility  to infection. although bacterial translocation from gut mucosa to mesenteric lymph node (mln) and systemic circulation is a well-known phenomenon after hepatectomy, its role in cirrhotic patients remains unclear. materials and methods: mln was harvested for bacterial culture before and after liver resection in 181 cirrhotic patients. the characteristics and postoperative courses of patients with positive and negative bacterial culture for mln after hepatectomy were compared. postoperative systemic antibiotics were administered if infectious complications occurred. results: no bacteria were cultured in mln before hepatectomy. bacterial translocation (bt) to mln after hepatectomy occurred in 36 patients (bt group). after multivariate analysis, intraoperative blood transfusion was the only independent factor that influenced bacterial translocation rates after cirrhotic liver resection. bt group patients also had higher infectious and overall complication rates, with a longer postoperative hospital stay. among the cultured bacteriae from infected sites in bt group patients with infectious complications, only 2 patients (12.5%) had totally different bacterial species to those cultured from mlns. conclusions: bacterial translocation more often occurred after liver resection in cirrhotic patients who received intraoperative blood transfusion. such patients had higher postoperative infectious and overall complication rates. thus, avoidance of intraoperative blood transfusion is mandatory for cirrhotic liver resection.

TI  == endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis: a 17-year prospective series and review of  267 reported cases.
AB  == endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis is a rare but serious condition that occurs  when bacteria cross the blood-ocular barrier and multiply within the eye. we provide an overview of endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis by reviewing 267 reported cases and integrating this with our experience of an additional 19 cases. the majority of patients with endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis are initially misdiagnosed and many have an underlying disease known to predispose to infection. this condition is often previously undiagnosed. blood cultures are the most frequent means of establishing the diagnosis. the most common gram positive  organisms are staphylococcus aureus, group b streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae,and listeria monocytogenes. the most common gram negative organisms are klebsiella spp., escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and neisseria meningitidis. gram negative organisms are responsible for the majority of cases reported from east asian hospitals, but gram positive organisms are more common in north america and europe. the visual outcome is poor with most cases leading to blindness in the affected eye. many patients have extraocular foci of infection, with an associated mortality rate of 5%. the outcome of endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis has not improved in 55 years and clinicians need to have a high level of awareness of this commonly misdiagnosed condition.

TI  == evaluation of infectious etiology and prognostic risk factors of febrile episodes in neutropenic cancer patients.
AB  == objectives: febrile neutropenic cancer patients are at risk for development of serious infections, morbidity and mortality. the aim of this study was to determine the type and frequency of infections and to evaluate some prognostic risk factors. methods: 220 episodes of neutropenic fever in 177 cancer patients have been reviewed. results: infections could be documented microbiologically in  38 (17.3%) episodes and suspected clinically in 29 (13.2%). the most common focus of infection was the lower respiratory tract (11.4%) followed by the urinary tract (6.4%). the most frequently isolated pathogen was escherichia coli (31%) followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (18%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (13%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (13%). the median durations of neutropenia and fever were 4 and 3 days, respectively. mortality was seen in 25 patients (11.4%). its rate was higher in documented infections except for non-bacteremic microbiologic  infections in which no death was seen. hypotension and shock were the most significant determinants of poor prognosis. conclusions: the management of these  special patients should be given adequate attention and be considered important since the success of therapy depends on revealing of etiologic agents.

TI  == comparative bactericidal activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin and norfloxacin against clinical isolates conventionally classified as resistant to fluoroquinolones were compared at their maximum concentrations in serum, urine (except moxifloxacin) and bronchial mucosa (except norfloxacin). time killing curves against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pneumoniae  were performed. serum concentrations of the tested drugs were not able to produce a bactericidal effect on fluoroquinolone-resistant strains. in the urine series,  levofloxacin was always bactericidal (decrease > or = 3 logs cfu/ml), while norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were bactericidal on e. coli (both), p. mirabilis (norfloxacin) and p. aeruginosa (ciprofloxacin). in the bronchial mucosa series,  s. pneumoniae was rapidly killed by levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, and k. pneumoniae by levofloxacin after 12 hours. in conclusion, the maximum levofloxacin concentrations achievable at certain body sites allowed killing even of strains defined as resistant by conventional breakpoints.

TI  == amoxicillin-sulbactam: a clinical and therapeutic review.
AB  == combinations of beta-lactamase inhibitors with penicillins, especially aminopenicillins, have broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against most of the  common pathogens of the respiratory and urinary tracts. this means that they are  an ideal treatment for infections such as otitis media, sinusitis, special cases  of pharyngeal tonsillitis (recurring forms, indirect pathogenic action, or after  the failure of amoxicillin monotherapy), acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, cystitis, urethritis, etc. the amoxicillin-sulbactam combination is active against both beta-lactamase producer and nonproducer strains, and is effective against gram-positive cocci (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus of nonhospital origin), gram-negative cocci (neisseria gonorrhoeae, moraxella catarrhalis and others), gram-negative bacilli  (nonhospital strains of haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae and others) and anaerobes. its antimicrobial activity means that it is indicated in the treatment of respiratory, ear, nose and throat, urinary, dermatological and gynecological infections caused by susceptible germs, as well  as in a variety of surgical situations (both as a treatment and as prophylaxis).  it is absorbed very well orally, and its pharmacokinetic profile is very favorable, with very good tissue penetration. it is reasonably well tolerated: in a variable percentage of cases it may cause modification of intestinal transit and/or fecal consistency, which usually abates spontaneously. the new formulation for administration at intervals of 12 h is easier to use, is better tolerated and favors completion of therapy. in summary, the amoxicillin-sulbactam combination is effective and well tolerated in most infections of nonhospital origin in adults and children.

TI  == [cefepime (maxipime), large spectrum 4th generation cephalosporin, resistant to beta-lactamases].
AB  == as a result of the appearance of bacterial strains resistant to 3rd generation cephlosporin, since 1993 cephalosporins of 4th generation have been developed and introduced in therapy; among them are: cefepime and cefpirome. cefepime is the most active 4th generation cephalosporin possessing the following advantages over the 3rd generation cephalosporins: high intrinsic potency due to rapid penetration into the periplasmic space; an extended spectrum of activity that includes many gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; activity against multi-resistant gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacter and klebsiella species; low potential for beta-lactamase induction, especially bush group 1 beta-lactamases, even ar low periplasmic concentrations; minimal selection of resistant mutant strains. its spectrum is very large being very active against gram-negative bacilii: enterobacter, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia, citrobacter, proteus mirabilis and less active against bacillus fragillis. cefepime is also very active against gram-positive cocci: staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains only), streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes. some of the methicillin-resistant strains of  staphylococcus are susceptible to cefepime; enterococcus is resistant. due to its high resistance against beta-lactamases cefepime (maxipime) is the best choice in life threatening nosocomial infections occuring in patients in the intensive care units. cefepime can be synergically associated with aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones.

TI  == pathogen of occurrence and susceptibility patterns associated with pneumonia in hospitalized patients in north america: results of the sentry antimicrobial surveillance study (2000).
AB  == antimicrobial selection for patients diagnosed with pneumonia is a major therapeutic challenge and dilemma to the clinical practitioner. in the community  setting, patients usually receive empiric oral therapy based upon multiple patient risk factors and locally prevalent pathogen susceptibilities. for patients admitted to the hospital with pneumonia, or who acquire pneumonia while  in the hospital, therapy can be initially empiric and then become directed once culture and susceptibility results are known. the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program since 1997, has monitored pathogen frequency and antimicrobial susceptibilities in hospitalized patients with pneumonia in north america. in this study 2,712 pathogens were studied from 30 medical centers (25 in the united states and 5 in canada). over 30 species of organisms were recovered with staphylococcus aureus comprising 28.0% of all isolates and with four other species (pseudomonas aeruginosa 20.0%, streptococcus pneumoniae 9.1%,  klebsiella spp. 7.5% and haemophilus influenzae 7.3%) constituted 71.9% of isolates submitted. methicillin (oxacillin)-resistant s. aureus accounted for 43.7% of all s. aureus isolates. antimicrobials demonstrating significant (>80%)  activity against s. aureus were: chloramphenicol (81.6%), tetracycline (91.4%), rifampin (96.4%) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (99.7%); and no isolate was resistant to glycopeptides or linezolid. north american isolates of p. aeruginosa were most susceptible to amikacin (93.7%) > tobramycin (90.2%) > meropenem (89.1%) > imipenem = piperacillin/tazobactam (85.6%) > piperacillin (82.1%) > cefepime (80.5%). overall, 32.1% of s. pneumoniae were penicillin non-susceptible while erythromycin susceptibility was only 74.8%. fluoroquinolones and recent generation cephalosporins retained excellent activity (gatifloxacin [99.2%] > levofloxacin = cefepime [98.8%] > ceftriaxone [97.2%]) against s. pneumoniae. klebsiella spp. were 100.0% susceptible to the carbapenems (meropenem and imipenem) but extended spectrum beta-lactamases were detected at a rate of 5.4%.  the beta-lactamase-positive rate in h. influenzae was 28.6% in north america (71.4% ampicillin-susceptible). the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program continues to identify important north american patterns of pathogen frequency and resistance. additionally, the provision of multi-year longitudinal data and associated reports allow for comparisons, which function as critical tools for effective patient management and antimicrobial interventions.

AB  == a prospective study was carried out on 70 burned patients admitted to the burn unit, ain shams university hospital, cairo, with the aim to verify the pattern of microbial colonization of burn wounds. throughout the study period starting from  1 june 1999 till 31 may 2001, 281 sampling procedures (surface swabs) were performed from the burn wounds. a total of 301 microbial isolates were grown in cultures. eight different species of bacteria, and only one species of candida (c. albicans) were detected. there was no incidence of recovery of anaerobic microorganisms. our results revealed that the most frequent isolate was pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.6%), followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (15.2%), then escherichia coli (13.6%), staphylococcus aureus (13.2%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (11.6%), streptococcus pyogenes (8.3%), enterobacter species (6.6%), and lastly streptococcus faecalis and candida albicans (5.9 and 3.6%, respectively). studying the time-related changes in burn wound microbial colonization showed an initial predominance of gram-positive cocci upon admission (70.7%) over gram-negative bacilli (27.6%). during the first 5 days, gram-negative bacilli started to predominate (55.7%) over gram-positive cocci (40.3%). burn wound sampling performed starting from the sixth day onwards, revealed further prevalence of gram-negative bacilli (72.7%) over gram-positive cocci (22.7%). as for candida albicans, there was a gradual increase in the frequency of its recovery as time elapsed from admission. it is crucial for every burn institution to determine the specific pattern of burn wound microbial colonization, the time-related changes in the dominant flora, and the antimicrobial sensitivity profiles. this would enable early treatment of imminent septic episodes with proper empirical systemic antibiotics, without waiting for culture results, thus improving the overall infection-related morbidity and mortality.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. special references to bacteria isolated between april 1999  and march 2000].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in japan since july 1982. in this paper, the results obtained in the academic year 1999 (from april 1999 to march 2000) have been summarized. two hundred seven cases were investigated, and 411 strains were isolated from 169 cases (81.6%). of those strains, 184 and 227 strains were from primary infections and postoperative infections, respectively. in primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes, streptococcus spp., and escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of gram-positive aerobes were higher than in primary infections. staphylococcus aureus were most frequently isolated among gram-positive aerobes, peptostreptococcus prevotii among gram-positive anaerobes, e. coli among gram-negative aerobes, and bacteroides fragilis among gram-negative anaerobes. in primary infections, the percentage of gram-negative aerobes, which gradually increased by the year 1998, decreased in the year 1999. the percentage of gram-negative anaerobes increased, while that of gram-negative bacteria was equivalent to that in the last year. in postoperative infections, the percentage  of gram-negative anaerobes, which continuously increased after the year 1990, decreased, while that of gram-positive aerobes, which decreased in the last year, increased. methicillin-resistant s. aureus accounted for 70.7% of s. aureus (41 strains). either the number of strain or the percentage of mrsa decreased. the susceptibilities of e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae decreased against third and forth generation cephems, oxacephems, and monobactams. the susceptibilities of p. aeruginosa to carbapenems tend to decrease after the year 1997. s. aureus showed  good susceptibilities to the tested drugs including arbekacin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in cairo, egypt 1999-2000: a survey of five hospitals.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens is a global problem, but in egypt data are sparse. we reviewed the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bloodstream isolates of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli in five hospitals in cairo, egypt, from 1999 to 2000. in addition, susceptibilities of non-bloodstream isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus spp. were analysed. high rates of resistance were found in most of the bacteria studied. in the hospitals, a variety of methods were used for identification and susceptibility testing, but in the laboratories quality controlled strains were utilized routinely, to ensure accurate performance of the assays. only 29% of staphylococcus aureus isolates and 23% of coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates were oxacillin susceptible. both groups of staphylococci were also highly resistant to erythromycin, co-trimoxazole, clindamycin and doxycycline; all isolates were susceptible to vancomycin. susceptibility of s. pneumoniae isolates to penicillin, ceftriaxone and fluoroquinolones was 63%, 84% and 82%, respectively. vancomycin susceptibility of the enterococci was 96%; susceptibility to high-level gentamicin and streptomycin was 54% and 48%, respectively. resistance to most relevant antimicrobials was commonplace among the gram-negative bacilli; however, most remained susceptible to imipenem. the percentage of bloodstream isolates of escherichia coli susceptible to common antimicrobial agents was as follows: ampicillin (6%), ampicillin-sulbactam (38%), co-trimoxazole (38%) and aminoglycosides (52%). the susceptibility of isolates of e. coli, klebsiella and enterobacter spp. to ceftazidime was 62%, 40% and 46%, respectively. this suggests a potentially high rate of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) and/or amp-c enzyme production. these results call for a nationwide surveillance programme to monitor microbial trends and antimicrobial resistance patterns in egypt.

TI  == microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  == aim: the present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. methods: we identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp). results: nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. a single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per ml of bile (> 105 cfu/ml). the predominant gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). the predominant gram-positive bacteria were enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. all gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (cim90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/ml. gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. although all five isolates of e. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) e. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. conclusion: e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. faecalis and streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.

TI  == naturally occurring immune response against bacteria commonly involved in upper respiratory tract infections: analysis of the antigen-specific salivary iga levels.
AB  == lyophilized bacterial lysates, which actively stimulate the immune response, are  widely used as vaccines or 'biological response modifiers' in subjects with recurrent bacterial respiratory infections. since vaccines are indicated in the absence or in the presence of a weak constitutive immune response activity, a better knowledge on the 'naturally' occurring antibacterial immune response at the oropharingeal level should be helpful. a study was, therefore, designed to quantify the presence of salivary iga directed against surface antigens bacteria  frequently involved in the pathogenesis of upper respiratory tract infections: klebsiella pneumoniae (kp), staphylococcus aureus (sa), streptococcus pyogenes (spy), morraxella catarrhalis (mc), haemophylus influenzae (hi), and streptococcus pnumoniae (spn). in 34 volunteers (21 adults and 13 children), salivary fluid was collected and the presence of microorganism-specific iga antibodies evaluated by a novel enzyme immuno-assay. in the whole population only 29 and 24% of subjects had iga directed, respectively, to kp and sa, while the immune-response against other microbes was detectable in a small population ranging from 12 to 15% of all subjects studied. we found higher proportions of individuals with strain specific salivary iga in the adult than in the pediatric  population for all the microorganism evaluated. in addition, in children, the only strain inducing a significant production of specific iga at oropharingeal level was kp. interestingly, only ten out of 21 adults and two out 13 children have at least one significantly high antibody titer against one of the bacteria evaluated. nevertheless, when a group of healthy donors was treated with a polyvalent mechanical bacterial lysate (ismigen t.), the large majority developed a specific immune-response in the salivary fluid. these results are thus consistent with the good features of the novel enzyme-immunoassay and with a poor frequency of naturally induced specific anti-microbe antibodies in children and in adults despite the presence on recurrent respiratory infections in their clinical history.

TI  == emerging bacterial pathogens: a consensus of the scientific data and the risk for development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
AB  == antibiotic resistance in the hospital setting is continuing to increase, particularly in intensive care units (icus) and other areas of the hospital such  as oncology units, where the use of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics is common. the problem of antibiotic resistance is also compounded in the immunocompromised  patient. multi-drug resistance is common among both gram-positive and -negative bacteria, and becoming more prevalent among fungi (yeast). two major antibiotic-resistant pathogens include extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing klebsiella pneumoniae (esbl-kp) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). when  infections occur with esbl-kp, a carbapenem antibiotic is usually the drug of choice. when infection occurs with vre, specific therapy is bacteriostatic, and the clinician may have to rely on empirically selected antibiotics or combinations of antibiotics to achieve a positive outcome. two newly-approved agents, linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin can be used to treat infections caused by resistant gram-positive cocci, but the latter is approved for use against vr-e. faecium. risk factors for the development of esbl-kp include the use of extended-spectrum cephalosporins such as ceftazidime. risk factors for the development of vre include inappropriate use of vancomycin, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and antianaerobic drug therapy such as clindamycin. several institutions have documented a reduction in one or both of these resistant pathogens following a decrease in the use of extended-spectrum cephalosporins combined with the increased use of extended-spectrum penicillins/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, such as piperacillin/tazobactam, for the empiric therapy  of infections. for vre, a reduction in the inappropriate use of vancomycin is also an important interventional strategy along with improved infection control practice.

TI  == acute bacterial suppurative parotitis: microbiology and management.
AB  == the parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. the most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial parotitis are staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. the predominant anaerobes include gram-negative bacilli (including pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp.), fusobacterium spp., and peptostreptococcus spp. streptococcus spp. (including s.  pneumoniae) and gram-negative bacilli (including escherichia coli) have also been reported. gram-negative organisms are often seen in hospitalized patients. organisms less frequently found are arachnia, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, salmonella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, treponema pallidum, cat-scratch bacillus, and eikenella corrodens. mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of parotitis. therapy includes maintenance  of hydration and administration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy. once an abscess has formed surgical drainage is required. the choice of antimicrobial depends on the etiologic agent. maintenance of good oral hygiene, adequate hydration, and early and proper therapy of bacterial infection of the oropharynx  may reduce the occurrence of suppurative parotitis.

AB  == from october 2000 to september 2001, we collected the specimen from 410 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 16 institutions in japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various anti-bacterial  agents and antibiotics and patients' characteristics. of 499 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 493 strains were investigated. the breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: staphylococcus aureus 78, streptococcus pneumoniae 73, haemophilus infiuenzae 99, pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 64, p. aeruginosa (mucoid) 14, klebsiella pneumoniae 25, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis 21, etc. of  78 s. aureus strains, those with 4 micrograms/ml or more of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) occupied 53.8%. vancomycin and arbekacin  had the most potent activities against mrsa as observed in 1999. the frequency of s. pneumoniae exhibiting low sensitivity to penicillin (penicillin-intermediate s. pneumoniae: pisp + penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae: prsp) was 38.4% being consistent with that in 1999 (34.7%). prsp accounted for 11.0% of the total, being more than that in 1999 (3.0%). carbapenems had strong activities against s. pneumoniae. especially, panipenem inhibited the growth of all 73 strains at 0.125 microgram/ml. generally, all drugs had strong activities against h. influenzae with mic80s of 8 micrograms/ml or less. the drug that had the strongest activity  against h. infiuenzae was levofloxacin, which inhibited the growth of 94 of the 99 strains at 0.063 microgram/ml. tobramycin had a strong activity against p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) with mic80 of 1 microgram/ml. the mucoid  strain was little isolated (14 strains) but the susceptibilities to all drugs were better than the non-mucoid strain. k. pneumoniae showed good susceptibilities to all drugs except ampicillin and the mic80s were 2 micrograms/ml or less. particularly, cefpirome, cefozopran, and levofloxacin had  strong bactericidal activities against k. pneumoniae with mic80s of 0.125 microgram/ml, and cefotiam, second-generation cephems, also had a favorable activity being mic80 of 0.25 microgram/ml. also, all drugs generally had strong activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis. mic80s of all drugs were 2 micrograms/ml  or less. the drug having the strongest activity was imipenem and levofloxacin inhibiting all 21 strains at 0.063 microgram/ml. most of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older, accounting for approximately a half of the total (44.4%). as for the incidence by the diseases, bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the highest, being noted in 38.0% and 31.7% of all the patients, respectively. the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were s. aureus (18.3%) and s. pneumoniae (16.1%). in contrast, h. infiuenzae (20.4%) and p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid: 16.7%) were frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from all the patients were s. pneumoniae (24.3%) and h. infiuenzae (26.7%). the frequency of isolated s. pneumoniae tended to decrease with the increase in the number of administration days while that of isolated h. infiuenzae did not. the frequency of isolated p. aeruginosa tended to increase with the duration of administration. the isolated bacteria were comparable between the patients already treated with penicillins and cephems. in the patients treated with aminoglycosides, macrolides, and quinolones, p. aeruginosa was most frequently isolated (33.3 to 40.0%).

TI  == evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  == the newly developed rapid lumi eiken/is60 (rl/is60) system automatically determines mics by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. the present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility  testing. chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with mics determined by the reference microdilution method. when the mics of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (qc) strains (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the rl/is60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the qc limits  proposed by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the system  was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including e. coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, p. aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae. overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the rl/is60 system and the reference microdilution method. our  results suggest that the rl/is60 system provides rapid and reliable mics of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as qc strains.

TI  == bacterial resistance: origins, epidemiology, and impact.
AB  == the basic mechanisms of antibacterial resistance are well known, but critical new aspects continue to be discovered. recently discovered factors with major implications for the emergence, dissemination, and maintenance of resistance include multidrug efflux, hypermutability, integrons, and plasmid addiction. some resistances are widespread and others local, with prevalence rates often worst in newly prosperous countries and in those specialist units where antibacterial use  is heaviest. multidrug-resistant epidemic strains are critical to the total accumulation of resistance (e.g., among streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae), but it remains unclear why some bacterial lineages achieve epidemic spread whereas others that are equally resistant do not. the correlation between in vitro resistance and treatment failure is imperfect, but resistance undoubtedly increases mortality, morbidity, and costs in many settings. recent concern has led to a plethora of governmental and agency reports advocating less antibacterial use, better antibacterial use, better infection control, and the development of new antibacterials. the evidence that better prescribing can reduce resistance rates is mixed, and although changes to hospital regimens may reduce one resistance problem, other opportunistic bacteria may fill the vacant niche. overall, the best that can reasonably be anticipated is an improved balance between the accumulation of resistance and new antibacterial development.

TI  == sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  == aims: to test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. methods: the bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 iu/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin b was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees c with five inocula of 14 bacteria. two yeasts  (candida spp) and one aspergillus were also tested. contaminated media were then  inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened  daily by visual inspection. the sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. results: organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria  irrespective of the starting inoculums: streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, and haemophilus influenzae. for micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal  only (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, candida kruzei, aspergillus  fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (sd 13.8, range 2-52). in cases of detection by the  blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. conclusions: blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.

TI  == listeria monocytogenes-induced monomicrobial non-neutrocytic bacterascites.
AB  == spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (sbp) is a common complication in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. the organisms most commonly involved in this infection are gram-negative bacteria like escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, and gram-positive bacteria like streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus. listeria monocytogenes is an uncommon gram-positive bacillus implicated in infections in neonates, pregnant females, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients. listeria monocytogene-induced sbp is rare, with less than 40 cases reported in the medical literature. monobacterial non-neutrocytic bacterascites (mnb) is a variant of sbp, where the ascitic fluid culture is positive but the ascitic neutrophil count is less than 250/mm3. forty percent of these patients will subsequently have sbp. only 2 cases of mnb from l monocytogenes have previously been reported. we report a case of mnb in a patient with cirrhosis whose ascitic neutrophil count was 164/mm', but gram stain and microbiologic culture showed the growth of l monocytogenes.

TI  == intravitreal penetration of cefepime after systemic administration to humans.
AB  == purpose: to investigate the penetration of cefepime (a fourth-generation cephalosporin) into the vitreous after single-dose intravenous administration to  human subjects. methods: thirty phakic patients about to undergo vitreous surgery received 1 g (group 1, 15 patients) or 2 g cefepime (group 2, 15 patients) in a single intravenous injection before surgery. the indications for vitreous surgery were retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (24 patients), retinal detachment associated with giant retinal tear (4 patients), macular hole  (1 patient) and intraocular foreign body (1 patient). samples of vitreous and serum were obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 12 h after injection. three patients were used for each sampling time and for 1 g and 2 g of cefepime. samples were assayed for cefepime concentrations with high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). results: all the patients had detectable cefepime in their vitreous and serum measurable by hplc. the level of cefepime in the vitreous peaked at 2 h and reached a minimum at 12 h after intravenous injection in both groups. a mean peak vitreous level of cefepime was 1.91 +/- 0.13 microg/ml in group 1 and 2.86 +/- 0.37 microg/ml in group 2. the level of cefepime in the vitreous at 12 h after injection was 0.89 +/- 0.14 microg/ml in group 1 and 0.97 +/- 0.30 microg/ml in group 2. conclusion: the vitreous level of cefepime after intravenous injection was below the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic(90)) against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was over the mic(90) against proteus mirabilis, klebsiella spp., haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and enterobacter spp.

TI  == recognition of bacterial capsular polysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides by the  macrophage mannose receptor.
AB  == the in vitro binding of the macrophage mannose receptor to a range of different bacterial polysaccharides was investigated. the receptor was shown to bind to purified capsular polysaccharides from streptococcus pneumoniae and to the lipopolysaccharides, but not capsular polysaccharides, from klebsiella pneumoniae. binding was ca(2+)-dependent and inhibitable with d-mannose. a fusion protein of the mannose receptor containing carbohydrate recognition domains 4-7 and a full-length soluble form of the mannose receptor containing all domains external to the transmembrane region both displayed very similar binding specificities toward bacterial polysaccharides, suggesting that domains 4-7 are sufficient for recognition of these structures. surprisingly, no direct correlation could be made between polysaccharide structure and binding to the mannose receptor, suggesting that polysaccharide conformation may play an important role in recognition. the full-length soluble form of the mannose receptor was able to bind simultaneously both polysaccharide via the carbohydrate recognition domains and sulfated oligosaccharide via the cysteine-rich domain. the possible involvement of the mannose receptor, either cell surface or soluble, in the innate and adaptive immune responses to bacterial polysaccharides is discussed.

TI  == intrapulmonary neutrophil apoptosis in a pig model of pneumonia.
AB  == background: apoptosis and necrosis are two distinct cell death modalities. polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmnl) play an important role in pneumonia and little information is available on whether these cells are cleared by necrosis or apoptosis. we therefore compared the proportion of apoptotic pmnl in lung tissues with and without pneumonia. in addition, the association of pmnl apoptosis and mechanical ventilation (mv) was investigated. methods: samples obtained from a pig model developed to tracheobronchial stenting were analysed. pneumonia was induced with that model in 10 animals (white-landrace piglets, pittman-moore or gottingen minipigs). animals were sacrificed when clinical parameters of pneumonia became evident and 17 lung samples could be analysed for histologic evidence of pneumonia, growth of micro-organisms, and the apoptotic index (proportion of apoptotic pmnl over all pmnl in a 400-power field). in addition, lung samples (n = 7) from two pigs without stent implantation on mechanically ventilated for more than 48 h were studied. results: a total of 9/17 samples (53%) showed histologic evidence of pneumonia, 11/17 (65%) had significant bacterial growth (> 10(3) cfu/g), and 7/17 (41%) fulfilled both criteria. the apoptotic index was not significantly different in samples with and without histologic evidence of pneumonia (pneumonia: 25.3 +/- 6.1% vs. no pneumonia: 25.2 +/- 11.9%; 95%ci: -9.7 - 9.5, p = 0.989) or in samples with and without significant bacterial growth (significant bacterial growth: 23.5+/-9.3% vs. no significant bacterial growth: 28.5+/-8.2%; 95%ci: -4.6 - 16.7; p = 0.284). however, the apoptotic index was higher in samples of pigs, mechanically ventilated for more than 48 h, compared to the stent group (mv: 36.9+/-10.7% vs.  stent: 25.2 +/- 9.0%; 95% ci: -20.5 - -2.9; p = 0.012). conclusion: in an animal  model, the proportion of apoptotic pmnl was not different in lung samples with and without histologic or bacterial pneumonia. however, mv for more than 48 h was associated with a higher proportion of apoptotic pmnl in lung tissue. this study  may be helpful for the understanding of the evolution of lung tissue damage induced by bacterial pneumonia and mv.

AB  == a study was conducted to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of selected commercial mastitis medications with and without edta-tris by comparing minimum inhibitory concentrations and minimum bactericidal concentrations in vitro. solutions containing 5 mm edta/50 mm tris potentiated the antimicrobial action of seven commercially available mastitis medications when reacted in vitro with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. lesser potentiation was observed for escherichia coli, whereas no potentiation was observed for klebsiella pneumoniae. the incorporation of edta-tris solutions into mastitis medications may reduce the amount of antibiotics necessary for therapy and may prevent formation of antibiotic-resistant forms.

TI  == trends in antibacterial susceptibility of mastitis pathogens during a seven-year  period.
AB  == milk samples collected from dairy cattle suspected of having mastitis were submitted to the microbiology laboratory of the animal health diagnostic laboratory, michigan state university, for bacteriologic culture. a total of 2778 isolates, from the years 1994 to 2000, were isolated, identified, and subjected to in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing using the disk diffusion method, in accordance with national committee on clinical laboratory standards (nccls) standards. isolates included in this study were streptococcus uberis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcesens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the proportion of bacterial isolates determined to be susceptible did not change during the 7-yr period for the majority of bacterial-antibacterial interactions tested. however, analysis for linear trend in proportions determined that there were increases in the proportion of s. aureus isolates that were susceptible to ampicillin, penicillin, and erythromycin. for strep. uberis, increases in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred for oxacillin, sulfa-trimethoprim, gentamicin, and pirlimycin, and a decrease in the proportion  of susceptible isolates occurred with penicillin. for strep. dysgalactiae, increases in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred with erythromycin, gentamicin, sulfa-trimethoprim, and tetracycline. for strep. agalactiae, increases in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred with sulfa-trimethoprim. among e. coli isolates, there was an increase in the proportion that were susceptible to ampicillin and cephalothin. among k pneumoniae isolates, there was an increase in the proportion that were susceptible to ceftiofur. overall, there was no indication of increased resistance of mastitis isolates to antibacterials that are commonly used in dairy cattle.

TI  == pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral beta-lactam antibiotics as a two-dimensional approach to their efficacy.
AB  == pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters are increasingly recognized as important determinants of the therapeutic efficacy of an antibiotic. for beta-lactam antibiotics, the most important determinant of the antimicrobial efficacy, and hence predictor of therapeutic efficacy, is the length of time that serum concentrations exceed the mic. dosing schedules for beta-lactam antibiotics should maintain serum concentrations above the mic for the bacterial pathogen for at least 50% of the dosing interval to achieve therapeutic efficacy and prevent the development of resistance. this is a basic criterion for the clinical efficacy of beta-lactams. a combination of microbiological activity and pharmacokinetic characteristics was applied to calculate the time that serum antibiotic concentrations exceed the mic for the major respiratory tract pathogens such as streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae. in contrast with some other oral beta-lactam antibiotics, cefpodoxime 200 mg bd maintains serum concentrations above the mic for each organism for at least 50% of the dosing interval and may therefore be an attractive choice for empirical therapy of community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections.

TI  == antibacterial activity of oral antibiotics against community-acquired respiratory pathogens from three european countries.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance is universally recognized as a major problem. a european resistance survey was established to monitor the activity of widely used oral antibiotics against common respiratory tract pathogens. studies were conducted in italy, spain and austria to monitor resistance patterns among respiratory streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae to amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav, penicillin, cefaclor, cefadroxil, cefalexin, cefprozil, cefuroxime, cefixime, ceftibuten, cefpodoxime, clarithromycin and azithromycin (the antibiotics tested varying slightly from country to country). minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using the nccls-recommended broth microdilution method. among the antibiotics tested, cefpodoxime, an oral cephalosporin, was remarkably active against the major respiratory pathogens in all three countries. cefpodoxime was more potent than cefaclor, cefixime and ceftibuten against pneumococci, especially against strains with decreased sensitivity to penicillin, and more active than cefaclor and cefuroxime against gram-negative respiratory pathogens. pneumococci and staphylococci displayed a very high level of in vitro macrolide resistance. these data indicate that cefpodoxime represents an appropriate choice in the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infection in the three countries surveyed.

TI  == potency and antimicrobial spectrum update for piperacillin/tazobactam (2000): emphasis on its activity against resistant organism populations and generally untested species causing community-acquired respiratory tract infections.
AB  == the in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam and several comparison broad-spectrum compounds was assessed against recent clinical isolates of gram-positive and -negative bacteria from geographically diverse medical centers  in europe, north and latin america participating in various surveillance programs in 2000. several organisms were characterized for phenotypic expression of various resistant determinants such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) or amp c cephalosporinase hyperproduction, and vancomycin resistance in enterococci  (vre). piperacillin/tazobactam retained activity (mic50) against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus spp. (0.12-0.5 microg/ml), bacillus spp. (0.5 microg/ml), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (>4 microg/ml), and corynebacterium spp. (2 microg/ml; not including c. jeikeium) with susceptibility rates of 100.0, 91.7, 85.7 and 81.8%, respectively. piperacillin/tazobactam inhibited all streptococcus spp. strains at < or = 16 microg/ml, including penicillin-resistant strains many of which were co-resistant to erythromycin (90%) and other beta-lactams. a specific breakpoint for these streptococci when testing piperacillin/tazobactam appears needed to prevent false-resistant reports using penicillin as a class representative. the carbapenems among beta-lactams were the most active agents against the esbl-producing species of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae and those strains which hyper-express amp c enzymes including citrobacter spp. and enterobacter spp. piperacillin/tazobactam  only exhibited modest activity against the "amp c resistance group" strains (68.8% susceptible or intermediate, mic < or = 64 microg/ml). piperacillin/tazobactam (mic50, 8 microg/ml; 79.5% susceptible) was the most active agent tested against multi-drug resistant isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa. against sampled haemophilus influenzae (39.2% ampicillin-resistant),  piperacillin/tazobactam (mic(90,) < or = 0.06 microg/ml), ceftriaxone and ceftazidime inhibited 100.0% of the isolates at < or = 0.25 microg/ml. these in vitro surveillance results from the year 2000 on three continents, demonstrated a sustained potent activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against selected problematic nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. the potential importance of these findings is that this beta-lactamase inhibitor combination can be used an empiric treatment of serious infections in hospital environments where resistance has emerged, as well as covering nearly all isolates of fastidious respiratory tract  pathogens acquired in the community setting.

TI  == pharmacodynamics of the new fluoroquinolone gatifloxacin in murine thigh and lung infection models.
AB  == gatifloxacin is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone with enhanced activity against gram-positive cocci. we used the neutropenic murine thigh infection model to characterize the time course of antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin and determine which pharmacokinetic (pk)-pharmacodynamic (pd) parameter best correlated with efficacy. the thighs of mice were infected with 10(6.5) to 10(7.4) cfu of strains of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, or escherichia coli, and the mice were then treated for 24 h with 0.29 to 600 mg of  gatifloxacin per kg of body weight per day, with the dose fractionated for dosing every 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. levels in serum were measured by microbiologic assay. in vivo postantibiotic effects (paes) were calculated from serial values of the log(10) numbers of cfu per thigh 2 to 4 h after the administration of doses of 8  and 32 mg/kg. nonlinear regression analysis was used to determine which pk-pd parameter best correlated with the numbers of cfu per thigh at 24 h. pharmacokinetic studies revealed peak/dose values of 0.23 to 0.32, area under the concentration-time curve (auc)/dose values of 0.47 to 0.62, and half-lives of 0.6 to 1.1 h. gatifloxacin produced in vivo paes of 0.2 to 3.1 h for s. pneumoniae and 0.4 to 2.3 h for s. aureus. the 24-h auc/mic was the pk-pd parameter that best correlated with efficacy (r(2) = 90 to 94% for the three organisms, whereas  r(2) = 70 to 81% for peak level/mic and r(2) = 48 to 73% for the time that the concentration in serum was greater than the mic). there was some reduced activity when dosing every 24 h was used due to the short half-life of gatifloxacin in mice. in subsequent studies we used the neutropenic and nonneutropenic murine thigh and lung infection models to determine if the magnitude of the auc/mic needed for the efficacy of gatifloxacin varied among pathogens (including resistant strains) and infection sites. the mice were infected with 10(6.5) to 10(7.4) cfu of four isolates of s. aureus (one methicillin resistant) per thigh,  nine isolates of s. pneumoniae (two penicillin intermediate, four penicillin resistant, and two ciprofloxacin resistant) per thigh, four isolates of the family enterobacteriaceae per thigh, a single isolate of pseudomonas aeruginosa per thigh, and 10(8.3) cfu of klebsiella pneumoniae per lung. the mice were then  treated for 24 h with 0.29 to 600 mg of gatifloxacin per kg every 6 or 12 h. a sigmoid dose-response model was used to estimate the dose (in milligrams per kilogram per 24 h) required to achieve a net bacteriostatic effect over 24 h. mics ranged from 0.015 to 8 microg/ml. the 24-h auc/mics for each static dose (1.7 to 592) varied from 16 to 72. mean +/- standard deviation 24-h auc/mics for  isolates of the family enterobacteriaceae, s. pneumoniae, and s. aureus were 41 +/- 21, 52 +/- 20, and 36 +/- 9, respectively. methicillin, penicillin, or ciprofloxacin resistance did not alter the magnitude of the auc/mic required for  efficacy. the 24-h auc/mics required to achieve bacteriostatic effects against k. pneumoniae were quite similar in the thigh and lung (70 versus 56 in neutropenic  mice and 32 versus 43 in nonneutropenic mice, respectively). the magnitude of the 24-h auc/mic of gatifloxacin required for efficacy against multiple pathogens varied only fourfold and was not significantly altered by drug resistance or site of infection.

TI  == streptococcus pneumoniae polysaccharides conjugated to the outer membrane protein a from klebsiella pneumoniae elicit protective antibodies.
AB  == polysaccharides (pss) derived from streptococcus pneumoniae include more than 90  serotypes and differ greatly in their immunogenicity. in addition, immunization with pss does not induce high affinity antibody production and no memory b-cells  are generated. coupling pss to carrier proteins has been reported to induce b-cell maturation and to install a b-cell memory. as an alternative carrier protein, the outer membrane protein a (ompa) derived from klebsiella pneumoniae has been coupled to various pss. we evaluated the immunogenicity of two ps conjugates, using ps derived from s. pneumoniae types 14 and 19. in this report,  we show that anti-ps igg responses are generated after the conjugation of pss to  p40. in addition, the humoral response generated is able to protect mice from a bacterial challenge. our results indicate that p40 could be included in the development of new ps conjugate vaccines.

TI  == ceftriaxone activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated in us clinical microbiology laboratories from 1996 to 2000: results from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa.
AB  == ceftriaxone was introduced into clinical practice in the usa in 1985 and was the  first extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporin approved for once-daily  treatment of patients with gram-positive or gram-negative infections. review of ceftriaxone activity is important given its continued use since the mid-1980s and reports of emerging resistance among all antimicrobial agent classes. we reviewed the activity of ceftriaxone and relevant comparative agents against five gram-positive and 11 gram-negative species for a 5-year period, 1996-2000, using  data from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa. all mic results were interpreted using nccls breakpoint criteria. ceftriaxone resistance among isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (n=17219) remained essentially unchanged over the 5 years studied and in fact was lower from 1998 to 2000 (5.0-5.1%) than  in 1996 (6.3%) and 1997 (6.6%). ceftriaxone resistance (range, 5.1-6.9%) among viridans group streptococci (n=6621) varied by <2% from 1997 to 2000. beta-lactam-resistant streptococcus pyogenes (n=935) and group b beta-haemolytic  streptococci (n=2267) were not identified in any year. among methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (n=39 284) ceftriaxone resistance was 0.1-0.3% per year from 1996 to 2000. ceftriaxone resistance among escherichia coli (n=472407; range, 0.2-0.4%), klebsiella oxytoca (n=16231; range, 3.5-4.8%),  klebsiella pneumoniae (n=117754; range, 1.9-2.6%), proteus mirabilis (n=67692; range, 0.2-0.3%), morganella morganii (n=11251; range, 0.3-2.1%) and serratia marcescens (n=26519; range, 1.6-3.8%) was low and consistent from 1996 to 2000. resistance to ceftriaxone among enterobacter cloacae (n=48114; range, 21.7-23.9%) was relatively high, compared with other enterobacteriaceae, but unchanged from 1996 to 2000. rates of resistance to ceftriaxone among acinetobacter spp. (n=20813) increased from 24.8% in 1996 to 45.1% in 2000. all haemophilus influenzae (n=7911) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (n=218) were susceptible to ceftriaxone, as were 99.7% of moraxella catarrhalis (n=312) tested in 1996 and 1997. in summary, ceftriaxone has retained its potent activity against the most commonly encountered gram-positive and gram-negative human pathogens despite widespread and ongoing clinical use for more than 15 years.

TI  == jaundice as an early diagnostic sign of urinary tract infection in infancy.
AB  == objective: urinary tract infections (utis) are a common clinical problem in febrile infants younger than 8 weeks old, with a prevalence between 5% and 11%. previous studies have noted that jaundice may be one of the first signs of a bacterial infection in infants. our goal was to determine the incidence of utis in asymptomatic, jaundiced infants younger than 8 weeks old and to determine which historical and laboratory parameters are associated with utis. methods: we  prospectively evaluated asymptomatic, jaundiced infants younger than 8 weeks old  for evidence of a uti (defined as >10 000 colony-forming units per milliliter of  a single pathogen, obtained by bladder catheterization). a serum fractionated bilirubin level was obtained on all study patients. detailed questionnaires were  completed, which included demographic information, prenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal events. results: twelve (7.5%) of 160 infants had a uti (95% confidence interval: 3.9%-12.7%). isolated organisms included escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterococcus, klebsiella pneumoniae, group b streptococcus, streptococcus viridans, and staphylococcus aureus. patients with the onset of jaundice after 8 days of age had a higher incidence of uti, 6 (50%) of 12 infants in the positive culture group, versus 15 (10%) of 148 infants in the negative culture group. abnormal urinalysis and microscopy results were noted in 5 (42%) of 12 infants with a uti, and 6 (55%) of 11 infants had abnormal renal ultrasound results. conclusion: a uti was found in 7.5% of asymptomatic, afebrile, jaundiced infants younger than 8 weeks old. in addition, infants with the onset of jaundice after 8 days of age or patients with an elevated conjugated bilirubin fraction were more likely to have a uti. therefore, we recommend that testing for a uti be included as part of the evaluation in asymptomatic, jaundiced infants presenting  to the emergency department.

(10%). considering the germs identified in the various clinical syndromes, we found a high frequency of anaerobes associated to suppurations (51%), interstitial lung diseases (43%) and tumors (37%), while ps. aeruginosa is first in post-tb syndromes (50%) and copd exacerbations (21%),  equal to h. influenzae. in pneumonias, str. pneumoniae was most frequently isolated (38%) followed by h. influenzae (25%). the susceptibility testing of strains of klebsiella and ps. aeruginosa revealed the increasing tendency to resistance to broad spectrum antibiotics, especially for ps. aeruginosa, with consecutive difficulties in finding the appropriate treatment.

TI  == nb2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  == enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ecta) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. we present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ecta compounds, nb2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of nb2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) nb2001 is a substrate for tem-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/k(m)) of greater than 77,000 m-1 s-1. (ii) triclosan is detected in nb2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli but not in e. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) nb2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing e. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. nb2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae. nb2001 is also active against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae.  the results indicate that nb2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent  and demonstrate the potential of ecta in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.

AB  == fullerene compounds have avid reactivity with free radicals and are regarded as 'radical sponges'. the trimalonic acid derivative of fullerene is one of the water-soluble compounds that has been synthesized and found to be an effective antioxidant both in vivo and in vitro. carboxyfullerene has been shown to be effective in the treatment of both gram-positive and -negative infections, although its mode of action is poorly understood. we determined the mic and minimal bactericidal concentration of carboxyfullerene for 20 isolates, including staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi and klebsiella pneumoniae. we further investigated the action of carboxyfullerene using transmission electron microscopy (tem), anticarboxyfullerene antibody binding assay and a membrane perturbation assay. all gram-positive species were inhibited by < or = 50 mg/l of carboxyfullerene, whereas gram-negative species were not inhibited, even at 500 mg/l carboxyfullerene. bactericidal activity was demonstrated only for gram-positive species, particularly for streptococcus pyogenes a-20, which was killed rapidly. intercalation of carboxyfullerene into the cell wall of staphylococci and streptococci was demonstrated by tem and anti-carboxyfullerene  binding assay. damage to the cell membrane in gram-positive, but not gram-negative, bacteria was confirmed by the membrane perturbation assay. these findings indicate that the action of carboxyfullerene on gram-positive bacteria is achieved by insertion into the cell wall and destruction of membrane integrity.

TI  == use of computerized image analysis to quantify staphylococcal adhesion to canine  corneocytes: does breed and body site have any relevance to the pathogenesis of pyoderma?
AB  == an optimized system of computerized image analysis was used to investigate variations in the adherence of staphylococcus intermedius to canine corneocytes from four different breed groups and six different anatomical sites. s. intermedius showed significantly greater adherence to the head and neck compared  with the dorsum, but adherence to the limb, axilla and groin did not differ from  other sites. furthermore, there was significantly greater adherence of s. intermedius to corneocytes from the dorsum, forelimb, axilla and groin of boxers  and bull terriers than spaniels and hounds. s. intermedius, and also pseudomonas  aeruginosa, exhibited abundant adherence, which was significantly greater than staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus canis, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli. in addition, s. intermedius adherence demonstrated a sigmoid dose-response  curve with increasing bacterial concentration. these results suggest that s. intermedius adheres to canine corneocytes by a specific receptor-ligand interaction and adheres to the skin of some breeds more avidly than others. however, variations in adherence between body regions would not account for the predilection sites of canine bacterial pyoderma.

TI  == production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 in whole blood stimulated by live gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == objective: to investigate the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-6 (il-6) induced by live gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria in whole blood in vitro. methods: in all, 49 different isolates were studied. each of the 49 different isolates was incubated for 4 h with whole blood at a ratio of one monocyte per 1--5 bacteria. plasma was then separated and frozen, and the concentrations of tnf-alpha and il-6 were measured  by enzyme immunoassays. results: there was a positive correlation between tnf-alpha and il-6 values, r=0.9. gram-negative bacteria induced higher levels of both tnf-alpha and il-6 than gram-positive bacteria. group g streptococci (ggs) induced higher levels of tnf-alpha than streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus  aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and group a streptococci (gas). klebsiella pneumoniae induced higher levels of tnf-alpha than haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli and neisseria meningitidis. ggs induced higher levels of il-6 than staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus and gas. when the relative amounts of cytokine induced by the strains were compared to serum concentrations  measured on admission in patients with bacteremia caused by the same bacterial isolates there was no significant correlation. conclusion: species- and strain-related differences in cytokine-inducing properties were found which may have significance in clinical infections.

TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against local bacterial isolates.
AB  == introduction: the emergence of resistance to common antimicrobials in bacteria has been increasingly reported in various countries. empirical antimicrobial therapy of various infections would therefore need to be reviewed. the introduction of new fluoroquinolones has created an interest in the use of these  as possible agents in the empirical treatment of respiratory tract infections. materials and methods: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the new fluoroquinolone, moxifloxacin, against 400 clinical bacterial isolates was determined by the e-test method. results: all streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (penicillin sensitive or resistant) were susceptible to moxifloxacin. similarly,  both beta-lactamase and non beta-lactamase producing haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis isolates were susceptible to moxifloxacin. as for enterobacteriaceae, 88.6% of the isolates tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin with mic < 8 mg/l, but resistance was noted for some of proteus mirabilis, klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli. enterococci and acinetobacter baumannii were resistant to moxifloxacin, whilst the anaerobes tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin. conclusion: moxifloxacin has good in vitro activity against common  organisms associated with community and nosocomial infections, with the exception of enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria. there was good anti-anaerobic activity against bacteroides fragilis and clostridum spp. results of this study are consistent with other similar published in vitro studies.

TI  == present situation of antimicrobial resistance in korea.
AB  == resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is a worldwide concern. in korea,  resistant bacteria are more prevalent than in other industrialized countries. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, erythromycin-resistant streptococcus pyogenes, penicillin non-susceptible pneumococci, beta-lactamase-producing gonococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, class c beta-lactamase-producing e. coli, fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli, and aminoglycoside-resistant acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa are examples of resistant bacteria prevalent in korea, and their presence suggests a high level of antimicrobial selective pressure and the nosocomial spread of resistant bacteria. recently observed rapid increases in the incidence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and carbapenem-resistant p. aeruginosa present new threats in korea.

TI  == in-vitro antibacterial activities of cefpiramide and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against 440 clinical isolates in china.
AB  == the in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefpiramide was compared with those of 15  other broad-spectrum cephalosporins. a total of 440 clinical strains of bacteria, including 9 bacterial species, were isolated from our hospital in 1998. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefpiramide and five other antibiotics were determined for each species, using the agar-dilution method. the mic of cefpiramide for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae was higher than those of three other third-generation cephalosporins, (ie, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone). fifty-one percent (26/51) of enterobacter cloacae  isolates were resistant to cefpiramide. cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime had greater activity against e. cloacae (resistance, 3.9% and 19.6%, respectively) than cefpiramide. cefpiramide was more active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (resistance rates, 12%) than cefoperazone, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, aztreonam, and cefepime. cefpiramide-resistant p. aeruginosa strains were resistant to ceftazidime, but 27% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were susceptible to cefpiramide; 15.3% of cefpiramide-resistant s. maltophilia strains were also susceptible to ceftazidime, but 50% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were still susceptible to cefpiramide. cefoperazone/sulbactam was the most active agent against acinetobacter baumannii, showing a resistance rate of 2%. ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftazidime, and cefpiramide were the second most active agents, and about 50% of the tested strains were susceptible to these three antibiotics. cefpiramide had an activity comparable to that of all tested beta-lactams against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 2 microg/ml). against streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, cefpiramide had good activity, with an mic90 concentration at which 90% of the strain was inhibited of 1 microg/ml and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. these results indicated that cefpiramide was more active against glucose non-fermenting bacteria than against enterobacteriaceae, and was very active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylo-coccus aureus, s. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae. thus, cefpiramide may be a good choice of drug for the treatment of patients with infections with glucose non-fermenting bacteria and community acquired infections.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity and penetration rate into sputum of gatifloxacin, a novel 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone, and its therapeutic efficacy in respiratory infections.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin against clinical isolates of  pathogenic bacteria was evaluated. minimum inhibitory concentrations of gatifloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and rifampicin against 20 strains each of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18 strains of enterobacter cloacae, 15 strains each of streptococcus pneumoniae and moraxella catarrhalis, 12 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 18 strains of mycobacterium intracellulare, and 22 strains each of mycobacterium tuberculosis and mycobacterium avium were determined. the minimum inhibitory concentrations90's of gatifloxacin against the above species were 0.12, 8, <==0.06, 0.5, 2, 2, <==0.06, 0.39, 0.05, 0.013, 2, 0.5, and 4 &mgr;g/ml, respectively. gatifloxacin was four times as active as ofloxacin against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, and as active as ofloxacin against enterobacteriaceae and  pseudomonas aeruginosa. gatifloxacin was as active as tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin against streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae. the antimycobacterial activity of gatifloxacin was similar to that of sparfloxacin. five patients with chronic respiratory infections and one patient with acute pneumonia received 100-400 mg/day of gatifloxacin orally for 5-12 days (mean, 8.17 days). the clinical effects were excellent in one patient and good in five. one strain of haemophilus influenzae was eradicated and one strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa persisted after therapy.  adverse reactions were mild and improved after completion of therapy. in one patient with chronic bronchitis, the maximum sputum concentrations 2-4 h after oral administration of 150 mg of gatifloxacin on days 1 and 6 were 0.88 and 1.45  &mgr;g/ml, respectively, and in serum the values were 0.84 and 1.24 &mgr;g/ml, respectively. thus it was found that gatifloxacin possesses potent activity against respiratory pathogens (including mycobacteriaceae), and shows good penetration rate into sputum, and that it can be used as the drug of first choice in the treatment of respiratory tract infections.

AB  == this study was performed in order to evaluate the efficacy of different mouthrinses whose use is extended in spain. six different antiseptic mouthrinses  were studied by means of determination of minimal inhibitory concentration (mic)  values against klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus mutans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. also in vivo experiments were carried out in volunteers by the use of mouthrinses and evaluation of bacterial populations before and after the treatment. finally, the kinetics of bacterial death was determined. results suggested that the determination of mic values is not a reliable method to evaluate the antibacterial effect of such products. on the other hand those rinsing solutions based on the effect of oxygen, such as those containing carbamide peroxide have a greater efficacy against anaerobic bacteria compared with rinses whose active molecule is a disinfectant. finally, the kinetics of bacterial death demonstrates that the essential oil rinse kills bacteria much faster. all tested mouthrinses were active as antibacterial although those based on oxygen production or essential oils were more active than solutions based on chlorhexidine and triclosan.

TI  == ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  == ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (pbp) 2 and 3. ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with mic90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella spp., serratia spp.,  proteus spp., clostridium perfringens, fusobacterium spp. peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic streptococcus spp. ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short pae of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the gram-positive strains but no pae against gram-negative strains. in an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to  ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. in comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. the protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. for pathogens with a mic of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated t > mic will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a mic of 1 mg/l 31%. for anaerobic bacteria with mic values between 1-2 mg/l, the t > mic may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. however, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.

AB  == csf-a beta 42 may be a marker of alzheimer's disease (ad). a decreased level of csf-a beta 42 is consistently found in ad and has been suggested to be related to the deposition of amyloid plaques in the brain. however, low csf-a beta 42 levels have also been found in disorders devoid of plaques, for instance creutzfeldt-jakob disease. to examine if the level of a beta 42 in csf is related to inflammatory processes, we studied csf-a beta 42 levels in eight patients with acute purulent bacterial meningitis, 10 patients with acute viral meningitis and  18 age-matched controls. in acute purulent bacterial meningitis, the csf-a beta 42 level was markedly reduced (28% of that in controls, p<0.0001), whereas no change was found in viral meningitis. after successful treatment of bacterial meningitis, the csf-a beta 42 level increased (p<0.05 compared to baseline) and did no longer differ from that in controls (ns). the decrease could not be explained by interference with high protein levels, since addition of increasing  volumes of serum did not influence the csf-a beta 42 levels. our findings suggest that the reduction in csf-a beta 42 found in bacterial meningitis is not a direct consequence of the inflammatory process. the cause may be disturbance of the clearance of a beta 42 from the brain.

TI  == [the sensitivity of common bacteria to antibiotics in children in southern israel].
AB  == background: many reports describe an increasing antibiotic resistance among various pathogenic bacteria. since every empiric antibiotic treatment is also based on the expected antibiogram of the probable isolate, it is essential to frequently monitor the resistance trends at different ages and contexts. aim: the purpose of this study was to monitor the antibiogram of a large bacterial population isolated from pediatric bacteremia episodes. methods: all bacteremia episodes of children under the age of 18 years in the soroka medical center, beer sheva, israel, were prospectively documented from january 1990 to december 1998.  results: of the 5,373 positive blood cultures that were noted during the study period, 1,689 were considered as true different episodes. during the years 1990-92, 1993-95 and 1996-98 454, 538 and 697 episodes were noted, respectively.  the most common pathogens were streptococcus pneumoniae (447 isolates), staphylococcus aureus (224 isolates), escherichia coli (187 isolates) and klebsiella spp (180 isolates). the antibiotic sensitivity of the pathogens declined with time in some of the cases and increased in others. the major problems raised were the development of esbl (extended spectrum beta lactamase) and mrsa (methacillin resistant staphylococcus aureus) producing isolates, high level of resistance of coagulase negative staphylococci and acinetobacter to most of the antibiotic agents, and increasing resistance of streptococcus pneumoniae to various agents. conclusion: despite the significant increase in the antibiotic resistance of many of the pathogens tested, there are still various therapeutic options available.

TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. a total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the national taiwan university hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. for many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. some strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum  inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. moxifloxacin was less active against p. aeruginosa, but was more active against s. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. the drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in taiwan.

TI  == an observational study on the epidemiology of respiratory tract bacterial pathogens and their susceptibility to four injectable beta-lactam antibiotics: piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone.
AB  == bacterial infections of the respiratory tract account for a large proportion of total medical consultations in general practice. in recent years, antibiotic resistance has increased alarmingly in a number of bacterial species that are common causes of these infections. the aim of this observational study was to determine the antibiotic resistance of microbial agents isolated from patients with acute or acutely exacerbated respiratory infections. subjects recruited as potential sources of bacteria were either outpatients seen in a number of specialized clinics and hospital practices, or hospitalized patients. overall, 648 consecutive patients (67% male, mean age 48.1+/-27.0 years) with infection of the upper or lower respiratory tract were observed during a 13-month period. a total of 551 pathogenic microbial strains were isolated and tested for their in vitro susceptibility to piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone. among all isolates, the four most frequent pathogens were pseudomonas aeruginosa (132 isolates, 24%), streptococcus pyogenes (99 isolates,  18%), staphylococcus aureus (93 isolates, 17%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (46 isolates, 8%). the susceptibility of gram-positive isolates ranged from 97.5% to  95.1%, and no remarkable difference was found in the antibacterial activity of tested b-lactam antibiotics. the susceptibility of gram-negative isolates to piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam was also similar: 96.5% and 97.1%, respectively. in contrast, differences were found between piperacillin (or piperacillin/tazobactam) and either ceftazidime (p=0.003) or ceftriaxone (p<0.0003) in gram-negative isolates. we conclude that, despite the extensive use of beta-lactam antibiotics (piperacillin, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone) in medical practice during the past three decades, the susceptibility of the most common pathogens involved in the etiology of upper and lower respiratory tract infections to these antibiotics is still high. in particular, bacterial resistance developed by gram-positive organisms against piperacillin is negligible and not alarming.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of ertapenem (mk-0826), a long-acting carbapenem, tested against selected resistant strains.
AB  == ertapenem (mk-0826) is a novel, long-acting parenteral carbapenem. the purpose of this in vitro study was to test ertapenem's activity against a collection of multiply-resistant strains of gram-positive and -negative bacteria isolated from  locations worldwide, and to examine its bactericidal activity and ability to act  in a synergistic manner in combination with other antimicrobial agents. ertapenem was active against a variety of gram-negative pathogens, with particular potency  noted for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae (mic90s < or =0.015-0.5 microg/ml) including extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains. less ertapenem activity was seen against pseudomonas aeruginosa, especially ceftazidime-resistant strains (mic50 16 microg/ml). except for enterococci, ertapenem was active against most gram-positive species, including beta-haemolytic streptococci (mic90 0.03 microg/ml; 100% susceptible), viridans group streptococci (mic90 2 microg/ml; 98.1% susceptible), and penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90 < or =0.015 microg/ml; 100% susceptible). ertapenem was also very potent against haemophilus influenzae  (mic90 0.25 microg/ml; 100% susceptible). bactericidal action was observed versus staphylococci, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae, and at least an additive effect was detected against the majority of the strains tested when ertapenem was combined with ciprofloxacin or gentamicin. these results from testing 902 organisms indicate that ertapenem appears to be a promising broad-spectrum carbapenem with  a possible role against some emerging resistant species.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of gar-936 tested against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive blood stream infection isolates and strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  == gar-936, a new, semisynthetic glycylcycline, has shown good antibacterial activity against a wide range of clinically important gram-positive and -negative aerobic bacteria including streptococcus pneumoniae, hemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, most enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus spp. the purpose of this study was to determine the activity of gar-936 against a range of gram-positive and -negative  bloodstream isolates including many strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls). six hundred four bloodstream isolates of gram-positive cocci collected as part of the sentry surveillance program were selected for their geographic diversity. gar-936 was also tested against an additional 176 gram-negative cocci isolates (klebsiella pneumoniae, 98 strains; escherichia coli, 78 strains), 96 of which were esbl-producers. broth microdilution testing was used to determine the susceptibility of the selected organisms and a range of comparator antimicrobial agents whose choice was based on their activities against the selected pathogens and included a mix of both newer and older agents. presence of an esbl-producing strain was confirmed using the clavulanate test. gar-936 demonstrated impressive activity against all 604 strains of gram-positive cocci, with an mic range of <or=0.015-1 microg/ml, and mic(90)s ranging from <or=0.05 microg/ml for s. pneumoniae to 0.25 for s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. mics against the 176 gram-negative isolates were higher (range 0.06-4 microg/ml), with mic(90)s of 0.25-1 microg/ml. the activity of gar-936 was relatively unaffected by the presence of esbls. the activity of gar-936 was particularly impressive against gram-positive cocci when compared against the test results for vancomycin and the newer antimicrobial agents, linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin. the mic(90)s for gar-936 were significantly lower than the comparator agents for all species tested with particularly impressive results against s. pneumoniae and enterococci.

AB  == from october 1999 to september 2000, we collected the specimen from 430 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 17 institutions in japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics and patients' characteristics. of 515 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 506 strains were investigated. the breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: staphylococcus aureus 78, streptococcus pneumoniae 101, haemophilus influenzae 104, pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 58, p. aeruginosa (mucoid) 11, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis 41, klebsiella pneumoniae 18, etc. of 78 s. aureus strains, those with 4 micrograms/ml or above of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) occupied 57.7%. vancomycin and  arbekacin showed the most potent activities against mrsa without detection of abk-resistant strain (mic: 64 micrograms/ml) and decrease of vcm-sensitive strains those were found in 1998. the frequency of s. pneumoniae exhibiting low sensitivity to penicillin (penicillin-intermediate s. pneumoniae: pisp + penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae: prsp) decreased to 34.7% from 46.0% in 1998.  the frequency of prsp was 3.0%, being the least number after 1991. carbapenems showed strong activities against s. pneumoniae. especially, panipenem inhibited the growth of all 101 strains with mic of 0.063 microgram/ml. generally, all drugs showed strong activities against h. influenzae with mic80s of 4 micrograms/ml or below. mics of ofloxacin ranged between 0.063 microgram/ml and 4 micrograms/ml in 1998, however, those were 0.125 microgram/ml or below in all h.  influenzae in 1999 showing the strongest activity. tobramycin and ciprofloxacin showed strong activities against p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) with  mic80s of 1 microgram/ml. number of isolated p. aeruginosa (mucoid) was little as 11, however, the susceptibilities to all drugs were better than p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid). k. pneumoniae showed good susceptibilities to all drugs except for  ampicillin with decreasing of low-sensitive strains compared to those detected in 1998. also, all drugs generally showed strong activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis. mic80s of all drugs were 2 micrograms/ml or below. the drug which showed the strongest activity was imipenem inhibiting all 41 strains with mic of  0.063 microgram/ml. on the patients' characteristics, the number of patients aged 80 years or older who had been increased was decreased in 1999 in the distribution by age. the percentage of the elderly patients aged 70 years or older was 47.0%, which occupied almost a half number of the total patients as in  the last year. as for the incidence by disease, bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the highest. they were noted in 37.9% and 30.5% of the patients,  respectively. in 1999, bronchial asthma was frequently observed as compared in recent years. it was noted in about 10% of the patients which is the same % as in bronchiectasis. we examined the number of strains from these patients with infections before and after administration of antibiotics. in patients with bacterial pneumonia, the number of isolated strains was almost the same between those before and after administration. however, in patients with chronic bronchitis, the number of strains remarkably decreased to less than the half of the total after administration of antibiotics in the last year, but it decreased  to 2/3 of the total in 1999. on the administration of antibiotics and isolated bacteria by the day of administration, the bacteria which were isolated more before administration were h. influenzae in 28.4%, s. pneumoniae in 25.7%, m. (b.) catarrhalis in 12.0% and s. aureus in 10.6%. the frequency of s. aureus after administration over 15 days was almost the same as that before administration, but the frequency of p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) was 36.8% which was higher than that before administration. the frequency of isolated s. pneumoniae was decreased after administration and none of them was isolated after completion of administration. however, that of h. influenzae was decreased to 7.1% after administration within 3 days, and many h. influenzae were isolated after completion of administration as 21.4%.

TI  == neonatal meningitis.
AB  == objective: to determine the prevalent bacterial agents of neonatal meningitis and their antibiotic susceptibility in a referral intensive care unit in assir central hospital, saudi arabia, during the years 1993-1998. methods: records of newborn infants with positive cerebrospinal fluid culture during the period were  retrospectively studied. results: there were 1473 nursery admissions, of which 32 episodes of meningitis occurred amongst 31 neonates. klebsiella pneumoniae (31%)  and serratia marcescens (21%) were the main pathogens. the incidence of concurrent septicemia among these infants was 58%. klebsiella pneumoniae appears  to dominate in both early and late onset infections. the sex incidence was equal  and the mortality rate was 48%. conclusion: the survey identifies klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia sp. as the leading bacterial agents of neonatal meningitis in our environment. the relatively high frequency of serratia infection in the present survey appears unique as this organism is comparatively  rare in other reports across the globe. no group b streptococcus was isolated, which is in contrast to reports obtained in europe, america and australia where it is the predominant organism of neonatal sepsis or meningitis. antibiogram identified imipenem and cefotaxime as the empirical antibiotics in infants with a clinical diagnosis of neonatal sepsis in our hospital; no more conventional use of ampicillin. in view of the changing bacterial pattern of infant infection with time even in the same environment, a periodic review of this subject is advocated.

TI  == pulmonary and systemic host response to streptococcus pneumoniae and klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia in normal and immunosuppressed mice.
AB  == mortality related to bacteremic pneumonia remains high, and the role of sepsis in inflammation, pulmonary injury, and death remains unclear, mostly in leukopenic states. in the present study, the microbiology, histopathology, and host response to streptococcus pneumoniae and klebsiella pneumoniae infection were determined in an experimental model of bacteremia in immunocompetent and leukopenic mice. leukocyte depletion by cyclophosphamide did not impair the early clearance of pneumococci from blood but facilitated growth in lungs. by contrast, klebsiellae  rapidly grew in blood of leukopenic mice. these observations suggest that tissue-based phagocytes and circulating leukocytes, respectively, play prominent  roles in s. pneumoniae and k. pneumoniae eradication. the kinetics of leukocyte recruitment in lungs during s. pneumoniae bacteremia suggested early strong inflammation in immunocompetent mice that is associated with tumor necrosis factor alpha release and histological disorders, including cell debris and surfactant in alveolar spaces. leukocyte depletion further stimulated pulmonary capillary leakage both in s. pneumoniae and k. pneumoniae bacteremia, which seemed attributable to bacterial virulence factors. nitric oxide production did not differ significantly among groups. leukopenia and low platelet counts characterized the late stage of bacteremia for both strains, but only k. pneumoniae altered renal function. understanding the pathogenesis of bacteremia will help establish beneficial therapies for both sepsis and pneumonia.

AB  == objectives: to assess the bacteriology of beta-lactamase (bl) enzyme activity in  sputum of 40 patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (aecb). methods: the microbiology, bl production by the different isolates, and bl contents in the sputum were determined. results: eighty-four isolates were recovered (2.1 isolates per specimen), 44 aerobic and facultative (1.1 isolates per specimen), and 40 anaerobic (1.0 isolate per specimen). aerobic bacteria were recovered in only 9 (22.5%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria in 9 (22.5%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were found in 22 (55%). the predominant aerobic isolates were streptococcus pneumoniae (15 isolates), haemophilus influenzae (11), moraxella catarrhalis and klebsiella pneumoniae (4 each). the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus sp. (19), prevotella sp. (11), and fusobacterium sp.(6). mixed flora were present in 25 (62.5%) specimens, and the number of isolates varied from 2 to 5 per specimen. thirty-nine beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (blpb) were isolated in 33 (82.5%) of the 40 cases. the predominant aerobic blpb were h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, k. pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. the predominant anaerobic blpb were prevotella sp. and fusobacterium sp. beta-lactamase activity  was detected in 26 (79%) of 33 of specimens in which blpb were isolated, and in none of the seven specimens that did not harbor blpb. conclusions: the rapid detection of bl activity in sputum specimens may have implications for the antimicrobial management with aecb.

TI  == efficacy of cefepime versus ceftazidime in the treatment of adult pneumonia.
AB  == effective empiric treatment of pneumonia requires antibiotic coverage against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, including drug-resistant isolates. this study evaluated the efficacy of cefepime treatment in 20 patients with community-acquired pneumonia (cap) and 21 patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap), and ceftazidime treatment in 20 patients with hap. the mean age  of patients was over 70 years. more than half of the patients had multiple lobe involvement. there was no significant difference in the severity of illness according to the acute physiology, age, chronic health evaluation (apache) iii score between the hap-cefepime and hap-ceftazidime group. the most common bacteria isolated from sputum of patients with cap were streptococcus pneumoniae  (n = 7), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2). in patients with hap, p. aeruginosa (n = 13), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 11), serratia marcescens (n = 6), k. pneumoniae (n = 5), stenotrophomonas maltophilia  (n = 5), enterobacter cloacae (n = 3), citrobacter spp. (n = 2), and escherichia  coli (n = 2) were isolated. the cure rates were 95%, 76%, and 60% in the cap-cefepime group, the hap-cefepime group, and the hap-ceftazidime group, respectively. the increased rates of antimicrobial resistance commonly found among isolates causing cap and hap indicate that extended-spectrum antimicrobial  agents, such as cefepime, would be more appropriate therapeutic agents.

TI  == the efficacy and safety of two oral moxifloxacin regimens compared to oral clarithromycin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == an international multi-centre, randomized, prospective, double-blind study compared oral moxifloxacin (200 mg or 400 mg once daily for 10 days) with oral clarithromycin (500 mg, twice daily for 10 days) in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (cap). the clinical success rate in the evaluable population at the primary efficacy assessment, 3-5 days after the end of study treatment, was 93.9% in patients treated with 200 mg moxifloxacin; 94.4%, with 400 mg moxifloxacin; and 94.3%, with clarithromycin. clinical success rates were  maintained at follow-up, 21-28 days after the end of treatment: 90.7% (200 mg moxifloxacin), 92.8% (400 mg moxifloxacin) and 92.2% (clarithromycin). the 95% confidence intervals indicated that all three treatment regimens were equally effective in treating cap. at follow-up, the 400 mg moxifloxacin dose had a slightly higher observed cure rate than the 200 mg moxifloxacin dose, but this was not statistically significant. the most frequently isolated pathogens were streptococcus pneumoniae (42%), haemophilus influenzae (19%), haemophilus parainfluenzae (10%), moraxella catarrhalis (6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5%) and  staphylococcus aureus (4%). the bacteriological success rate (eradication and presumed eradication) was 72.5% (29/40) for 200 mg moxifloxacin, 78.7% (37/47) for 400 mg moxifloxacin and 70.7% (29/41) for clarithromycin. the adverse event profile was comparable between the three treatment groups. most adverse events, possibly or probably related to the study drug, were generally mild or moderate in severity and mostly related to the digestive system: diarrhoea, nausea and abdominal pain in 200 mg moxifloxacin patients; diarrhoea, liver function abnormalities and nausea in 400 mg moxifloxacin patients and liver function abnormalities, diarrhoea, nausea and taste perversion in clarithromycin patients. study drugs were discontinued because of adverse events in 7/229 (3%) patients treated with 200 mg moxifloxacin, 11/224 (5%) with moxifloxacin 400 mg and 11/222 (5%) with clarithromycin. in all assessments, moxifloxacin was at least as effective clinically, and as well tolerated as clarithromycin in the treatment of cap. bacteriological success rates in moxifloxacin-treated patients were greater  than those of clarithromycin. moxifloxacin, given once daily, is free of many drug-drug interactions and requires no dosage adjustments in most renal hepatic deficient patients.

TI  == synthesis and antibacterial evaluation of certain quinolone derivatives.
AB  == a number of 7-substituted quinolone derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial and cytotoxic activities. preliminary results indicated that most compounds tested in this study demonstrated better activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus than norfloxacin. among them, 1-(4-amino-2-fluorophenyl)-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-7-[4-[2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-hydro xyiminoethyl]-1-piperazinyl]-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid (11d) and its ketone precursor 10d exhibited significant activities against klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, erythromycin- and ampicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis. due to strong cytotoxicities of 11d (a mean log gi(50) of  -5.40), compound 10d, with good antibacterial activities and low cytotoxicities (a mean log gi(50) of -4.67), is a more potential drug candidate.

TI  == [hospital acquired pneumonia--analysis of frequency and etiology in polish hospitals in 1998].
AB  == hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap) is one of the most frequently occurring hospital infections in the world. this study describes the incidence of hap in poland, as well as the specific risk factors leading to this type of infection in polish hospitals; including those of patient age, length of hospitalization, and  use of mechanical ventilation. the epidemiology of hap as well as treatment resistance of various causal organisms was studied. data for this study was acquired from the registry of hospital-acquired infectious diseases for the year  1998. out of 329,608 hospital-acquired infections in all patients except newborns, 920 were found to be hap. this study showed that of every 1000 hospital admissions three patients developed hap (0.3%). death occurred in 260 of 920 hap  cases or 30%; and hap found to be the direct cause of death in 66 of the 260 cases (25%). the greatest incidence of hap was found to occur in patients older than 75 years, was directly related to the length of hospital stay, and was higher in patients on mechanical ventilation longer than 10 days. the most frequently isolated causal agents were the gram-negative rods (pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter sp., klebsiella sp., enterobacter sp.), and staphylococcus aureus. streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae were found in only 2% and 4% of cases, respectively, and thus were the least likely causes of hap in this population. it was found that the percentage of methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus was very high (55% to 60%); vancomycin-resistant enterococci were only found in patients who did not undergo surgery. the isolated strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa showed marked resistance to chinolones (58-76%) and to imipen (approximately 20%). in the enterobacteriaceae family, klebsiella sp. was found to be resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (56-73%) and enterobacter sp. resistant in 55% to 81% of the isolates.

TI  == effect of different antibacterial agents and surfactant protein-a (sp-a) on adherence of some respiratory pathogens to bronchial epithelial cells.
AB  == some antibiotics at sub-inhibitory concentrations are able to alter bacterial surface structures and modulate adhesiveness by affecting the expression of microbial adhesins. an important mechanism of pulmonary defence against pathogens is sp-a, one of the proteins of the alveolar surfactant having opsonizing activity. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect that sub-inhibitory concentrations of different antibiotics and physiological concentrations of sp-a  (1 and 5 microg/ml) could exert on the adherence of respiratory pathogens to the  bronchial epithelial cell line, wi26va4. cefdinir and clarithromycin showed high  efficacy, mainly at 1/2 mic, in reducing the adherence of staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae strains to values lower or equal to 50% of the control; sparfloxacin showed the same effect on s. aureus and s. pneumoniae but teicoplanin only on s. pneumoniae. other similar results were observed with netilmicin on klebsiella pneumoniae (40%) and with cefepime and ciprofloxacin on pseudomonas aeruginosa (60%). clarithromycin reduced the adherence of k. pneumoniae to 80% although it is not active against this strain.  adherence of the test strains was not modified by sp-a alone or in combination with any of the antibiotics used.

(2) the proportion receiving antibiotics before hospitalization decreased with age. (3) there were striking atypical pneumonic symptoms, such as dyspnea and consciousness disturbance in the two age groups over 75 years old. (4) hypotension (shock) increased with age. (5) markers of nutritional conditions, such as serum protein, albumin, cholinesterase, and hypoxia remarkably increased in the two age groups over 75 years old. (6) there were no significant differences in the isolation rate of etiological microorganisms. (7) the number of polymicrobial agents in the < or =  54 years old group was lower than that in the other age groups. (8) mycoplasma pneumoniae was most significantly higher in < or = 54 years old group, haemophilus influenzae in patients 55-64 years old, and streptococcus pneumoniae  in both 65-74 and 75-84 years old groups. (9) the isolation rate of mssa, gram-negative bacilli such as klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, respiratory viruses increased with age. (10) the amount of sepsis increased with  age. (11) the prognosis was poor in the two groups over 75 years old because the  mortality rate (over 10%) was higher that for the other age groups.

TI  == integration of molecular characterization of microorganisms in a global antimicrobial resistance surveillance program.
AB  == the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program has incorporated molecular strain typing and resistance genotyping as a means of providing additional information that may be useful for understanding pathogenic microorganisms worldwide. resistance phenotypes of interest include multidrug-resistant pathogens, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and fluoroquinolone-resistant (fqr) strains of gram-negative bacilli and streptococcus pneumoniae. clusters of > or =2 isolates within a given resistance profile that are linked temporally and by hospital location are flagged for dna fingerprinting. further characterization of organisms with respect to resistance genotype is accomplished with use of polymerase chain reaction and dna sequencing. this process has been highly successful in identifying clonal spread within clusters of multiresistant pathogens. between 50% and 90% of mrsa clusters identified by phenotypic screening contained evidence of clonal spread. among the enterobacteriaceae, esbl-producing strains of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae are the most common pathogens causing clusters of infection, and approximately 50% of recognized clusters demonstrate clonal spread. clusters of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter species, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia have been noted with clonal spread among patients with urinary tract, respiratory, and bloodstream infections. characterization of mutations in the fqr-determining region of phenotypically susceptible isolates of e. coli and s. pneumoniae has identified first-stage mutants among as many as 40% of isolates. the ability to characterize organisms phenotypically and genotypically is extremely powerful and provides unique information that is important in a global antimicrobial surveillance program.

TI  == effect of some fractions of alveolar surfactant (phospholipids and sp-a) on the bactericidal activity of different antimicrobials against some respiratory pathogens.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the effects of physiologic concentrations, at alveolar level, of some fractions of pulmonary surfactant (phospholipids and sp-a) on the  bactericidal activity of different antimicrobials against some respiratory pathogens. methods: the antimicrobial agents cefdinir, sparfloxacin, clarithromycin, teicoplanin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, netilmicin and tobramycin,  depending on their specific activity, were investigated against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis,  klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. killing curves were carried out with antimicrobials at 0.5 and 2 mic, sp-a at 1 and 5 mg/l and phospholipids at 50 mg/l. results: time-kill experiments showed that while sp-a never modified the activity of antimicrobials, phospholipids exerted, in some cases, a weak antagonistic effect. among antibacterials and pathogens investigated, phospholipids were able to decrease the rate of killing of cefepime and ciprofloxacin only on p. aeruginosa, both at 0.5 and at 2 mic, with an increase of about 1 log in cfu. the combination of sp-a and phospholipids never modified the effect observed in the presence of lipids alone. conclusions: the paucity of  data only allow us to observe that the examined antibiotics do not have substantially reduced activity against respiratory pathogens studied in the presence of physiologic concentrations of some fractions of surfactant. cefepime  alone already exerted a small effect, and ciprofloxacin at 2 mic, even in the presence of phospholipids, retained its bactericidal activity.

AB  == we developed an algorism to identify microbial subtypes automatically from daily  antibiotic susceptibility data in clinical microbiology laboratory. the susceptibility pattern was expressed as a string of digits, each consisting of 0(resistant), 1(intermediate) or 2(susceptible) to respective antibiotics. any two patterns were regarded identical and combined if the difference at each digit never exceeds 1. the combined pattern was expressed as an array of digit-by-digit weighted averages of the two. the second combination was based on a degree of similarity among the numerical patterns using a formula, which was designed to emphasize differences in highly variable elements. this subgrouping procedure was done every three months. identity of the detected subtypes between the intervals  was determined using the same algorism as for the second combination. the algorism was applied to data of clinical isolates of mrsa, pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa), klebsiella pneumoniae (kp), enterococcus faecalis (ef), streptococcus pneumoniae (sp), escherichia coli (ec) that were obtained over a period of 4 years. three major subtypes of mrsa, kp and ef were consistently detected with shifting mutual frequencies. most of ec isolates belonged to two consistent subtypes. although pa and sp had one or two consistent subtypes, there were multiple minor subtypes of varying frequencies. this analysis is regarded as an "infotyping", in contrast to serotype or genotype, of clinical microbial isolates, which is useful for nosocomial infection surveillance.

TI  == interaction of bladder glycoprotein gp51 with uropathogenic bacteria.
AB  == purpose: a major component of bladder surface mucin is a glycoprotein gp51 (molecular weight 51 kd.). gp51, which has previously been isolated from rabbit mucosa, appears to function as part of the defense mechanism in an in vivo infection model. gp51 coats the epithelium and is secreted into the urine, as detected by immunohistochemical testing and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). increased urinary gp51 occurs during urinary tract infection. to elucidate the role of gp51 as a component of the primary defense mechanism we studied interactions with uropathogenic bacterial isolates and urine from symptomatic patients with urinary tract infection. materials and methods: elisa was performed to demonstrate the binding of gp51 and various uropathogens. immunochemical studies were done using monoclonal antibodies to gp51 to determine the interaction of gp51 with certain uropathogenic isolates, including escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and streptococcus faecalis. infected urinary sediments and uropathogenic bacterial cultures were examined by immunocytochemical testing to localize gp51. antigen inhibition elisa was done to quantitate urinary gp51 in the urine of 17 normal controls and 19 patients with urinary tract infection. results: elisa revealed that gp51 binds to a wide spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative uropathogens in semiquantitative fashion. immunochemical methods confirmed that purified gp51 binds to bacteria, encapsulating and aggregating the bacteria. clinical specimens showed gp51 localized to bacteria and uroepithelial  cells. we observed a significant increase in urinary gp51 in urinary tract infection compared to uninfected urine (p = 0.0003). conclusions: these studies suggest that gp51, a component of bladder mucin, may be a strategic factor in the primary defense mechanism of the bladder.

AB  == pneumonia is the second most frequent cause of nosocomial infection, and hospitalization frequently is needed for community-acquired pneumonia. knowledge  of causative pathogens through periodic surveillance, and their prevailing antimicrobial susceptibility patterns becomes paramount in choosing appropriate empiric therapy. the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, tracks pathogen distribution worldwide since 1997 and documents emerging resistance to a wide range of antimicrobial agents. during the respiratory disease season in 1998, each of 30 medical centers (25 in the united states [us], and five in canada [can]) contributed 100 consecutive isolates obtained from hospitalized patients with suspected pneumonia. the 2773 organisms, processed by the monitor consisted  of a total of 35 species, with staphylococcus aureus comprising 25.6% of all isolates and five other species (pseudomonas aeruginosa 18.7%, haemophilus influenzae 9.4%, streptococcus pneumoniae 7.8%, klebsiella spp. 7.0%, and enterobacter spp. 6.7%) making up almost 50% of the total. in the us, pneumococci (8.5%) were more prevalent than in can (4.1%; p = 0.001). the us isolates of s. pneumoniae were variably susceptible to penicillin (76.8%), with non-susceptible  strains demonstrating greater levels of cross resistance to macrolides (31.8%), cefepime (9.0%) and cefotaxime (6.8%), but remaining susceptible to gatifloxacin  and quinupristin/dalfopristin. h. influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were generally ampicillin-resistant, 40.4-44.4% and 93.7-95.7%, respectively. p. aeruginosa remained very susceptible to amikacin (91.3-93.8%) > tobramycin > meropenem > piperacillin/tazobactam > gentamicin > piperacillin > cefepime (80.0-81.8%). extended spectrum beta-lactamase phenotypes among the klebsiella spp. were isolated from five medical centers in the us and were 4.8-6.0% overall; a rate similar to the previous year. among the us isolates of enterobacter spp.,  only 77.6% and 79.6% were susceptible to ceftazidime and cefotaxime, respectively, but >90% were inhibited by cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones. isolates from can were generally more susceptible, except for pseudomonas isolates, where resistance to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones and imipenem was greater. the sentry program results outline important national differences in the frequencies of pathogen occurrence, but more importantly, identify unstable patterns of resistance to available antimicrobial drugs, and serves as a reference for results of other local, national or international investigations.

TI  == modulation of colonic barrier function by the composition of the commensal flora  in the rat.
AB  == background and aims: altered intestinal permeability is a key pathogenetic factor of idiopathic bowel inflammation. we investigated in the rat if changes in the composition of the bowel flora can alter colonic permeability. methods: a colonic segment was surgically excluded from faecal transit and brought out as a loop to  the abdominal wall through two colostomies. the loop was used for colonisation with specific bacterial strains after eradication of the native flora with antibiotics. lumen to blood clearance of dextran (molecular weight 70 000) and mannitol (molecular weight 182) was measured in rats recolonised with a single bacterial strain from rat colonic origin, and in control rats whose colonic loop  was kept free of bacteria by antibiotics. actual colonisation was confirmed by culture of segment effluents. results: colonisation with escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and streptococcus viridans significantly increased lumen to blood clearance of mannitol. colonisation with lactobacillus brevis had the opposite effect and reduced permeability to mannitol. bacteroides fragilis did not induce significant changes. permeability to dextran was not altered by any of the strains tested. conclusions: certain commensal bacteria can modify colonic wall permeability to luminal substances.

TI  == risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia in critically ill trauma patients.
AB  == objective: to determine risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia in critically ill trauma patients. design: prospective cohort study. setting: the trauma intensive  care unit (icu) of a 1500-bed tertiary-care hospital. patients: all critically ill trauma patients (n = 103) admitted consecutively between november 1995 and october 1996. interventions: a comparison of data recorded at the time of icu admission and during the clinical evolution in patients with (n = 23) and without (n = 80) nosocomial pneumonia was made. data referred mainly to possible risk factors were recorded; they also included factors related to pneumonia etiology and evolutive factors. predictors of nosocomial pneumonia were assessed by logistic regression analysis. measurements and main results: the presence of significant growth on quantitative cultures of the protected specimen brush (> or = 103 colony forming units/ml) was required to accept pneumonia as microbiologically proven, as well as the concurrence of a cohort of clinical and  radiologic signs. twenty-three (22.3%) patients developed nosocomial pneumonia. the mean age of these patients was 41.7 yrs; 18 of them (78.3%) were men. the microorganisms isolated in significant concentrations were acinetobacter baumanii (ten cases), staphylococcus aureus (11 cases), pseudomonas aeruginosa (five cases), haemophilus influenzae (two cases), and klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, enterococcus spp., enterobacter spp.,  coagulase-negative staphylococcus, and streptococcus intermedius (one case each one). risk factors for pneumonia by univariate analysis included nasogastric tube; continuous enteral feeding; prolonged mechanical ventilation (>1 day); use  of h2-receptor antagonist, sucralfate, muscle relaxants, corticosteroids, barbiturates, and inotropic agents; positive end-expiratory pressure; intense sedation; re-intubation; tracheotomy; urgent brain computed tomography (ct) scan; craniotomy; iatrogenic event; and hyperventilation. the mortality rate was 43.5%  (10 of 23) in the nosocomial pneumonia group and 18.8% in patients without nosocomial pneumonia (p =.02). also, the mean stay in the icu, the therapeutic charge (measured with total and mean punctuation of the therapeutic intervention  scoring system) and the complications, infectious and noninfectious, of the clinical evolution were significantly more frequent in patients with nosocomial pneumonia than in those without pneumonia (p <.05). in the multivariate analysis, continuous enteral feeding, craniotomy, prolonged mechanical ventilation (>24 hrs), use of positive end-expiratory pressure, and corticotherapy were independent predictors of nosocomial pneumonia. conclusions: it seems that factors related to the patient's clinical course, rather than variables registered on the first days of icu admission, are those that would exert an influence on the development of nosocomial pneumonia in critically ill trauma patients. in this way, from our point of view, in our study the main risk factors are the use of prolonged mechanical ventilation (>4 hrs) and positive end-expiratory pressure. at the same time, we can conclude that the reduction of  this infection incidence could decrease the mean stay in the icu, the therapeutic charge, and the prognosis in terms of mortality and morbidity.

TI  == systemic antibiotics fail to clear multidrug-resistant klebsiella from a pediatric icu.
AB  == study objectives: to determine the magnitude of infection rate and antimicrobial  resistance in a pediatric icu (picu), and to evaluate the efficacy of using broad-spectrum antibiotics. design: a 3-month, prospective, observational cohort  audit. setting: a 12-bed tertiary, referral picu. patients or participants: all children admitted to the picu for > 72 h. interventions: surveillance cultures of throat and rectum on admission and once weekly thereafter. measurements and results: of the 150 admissions during the 3-month period, a total of 52 patients  (24 girls and 28 boys) requiring mechanical ventilation for a minimum of 3 days were enrolled in the audit. the median age and interquartile range (iqr) was 17 months (iqr, 5.8 to 63); length of stay, 6.5 days (iqr, 4 to 13); ventilation days, 5 (iqr, 3 to 11); pediatric risk of mortality score, 14 (iqr, 9 to 19); and risk of mortality, 0.03 (iqr, 0.014 to 0.087). fifteen patients (29%) developed 21 infections, mainly lower-airway infections and septicemias. of the 52 children, 7 children carried multidrug-resistant bacteria and 3 patients progressed to develop four infections with those resistant bacteria. of the seven carriers, six patients carried gentamicin-resistant klebsiella. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and gentamicin-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa each were carried by one child. six of those nine resistant isolates were present in the admission flora. despite the potent combination of piperacillin/tazobactam and amikacin, three children acquired the multidrug-resistant klebsiella while in the picu and  became nosocomial carriers. conclusions: only surveillance cultures allow the distinction between import of multidrug-resistance and resistant bacteria acquired while in picu. in this study, two thirds of the resistant isolates were  imported. the introduction of newer potent systemic antibiotic combinations failed to control the endemic reservoir of multidrug-resistant klebsiella and suggests that such policies have little impact.

TI  == bacteraemia and mortality among adult medical admissions in malawi--predominance  of non-typhi salmonellae and streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == objectives: the high seroprevalence of hiv in malawi might be expected to alter the pattern of pathogens isolated from bacteraemic patients. we aimed to describe the frequency and seasonal pattern of bacterial isolates from blood, their antibiotic susceptibility, and patient outcome, in order to provide data on which to base empirical antibiotic therapy and further studies of pathogenesis. methods: over a 12-month period, blood cultures were taken from all febrile adult medical admissions to queen elizabeth central hospital, blantyre. results: a total of 2789 out of 9298 adult general medical admissions had blood culture performed, of whom 449 (16.1%) grew significant pathogens. non-typhi salmonellae  (nts) (37%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (30%) were the two commonest isolates. mortality was 18% among general medical admissions and 38% among bacteraemic patients. mortality for individual pathogens was: nts 33%; s. pneumoniae 36%; escherichia coli 54%; klebsiella spp. 58%; neisseria meningitidis 44%; salmonella typhi 17%. despite an overwhelming association between the major pathogens and hiv infection (95% of s. pneumoniae cases and 92% of nts cases were seropositive  for hiv), a seasonal pattern was preserved. streptococcus pneumoniae was more frequently isolated in the cold dry months, while stm isolates increased following a rise in temperature. a case of bacteraemia with vibrio cholerae (serotype 01) was detected during a cholera outbreak in the rainy season. although s. pneumoniae isolates were relatively susceptible to penicillin (88%) and chloramphenicol (74%), s. typhimurium isolates were fully susceptible only to chloramphenicol. conclusions: this large study confirms the dominance of nts and  s. pneumoniae in bacteraemia in an area affected by hiv-1 and allows comparison of mortality by individual pathogens. it demonstrates a preserved seasonal pattern of bacteraemia for these major pathogens, despite an overwhelming association with hiv infection.

TI  == common bacteria whose susceptibility to antimicrobials is no longer predictable.
AB  == the widespread use of antibiotics has been responsible for the development of numerous problems including the emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria, increased number of nosocomial- and community-acquired infections, less than optimal patient outcome, and increased health care costs. of equal concern is the emergence of resistance in clinical isolates to antibiotics that were once considered "standard" with predictable in vitro susceptibility patterns. such resistance has been especially notable in organisms that are commonly encountered in a variety of infections including, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus. enterococci, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli. it is important for the clinical microbiology laboratory to provide the practicing clinician with accurate and timely antimicrobial susceptibility information which requires the application of standardized and approved in vitro testing methods. the laboratory also serves as a sentinel by maintaining an active monitoring and surveillance program in which current in vitro susceptibility patterns can be compared with local, regional, and national data bases.

TI  == seven-year study of bacteraemic pneumonia in a single institution.
AB  == in order to enhance current knowledge of nosocomial and community-acquired bacteraemic pneumonia in a single tertiary hospital in israel, a 7-year study was conducted. using a computerised database, all patients who had bacteraemic pneumonia from march 1988 to august 1995 were studied. during the study period, pneumonia was the source of bacteraemia in 319 of 4,548 (7%) episodes, occurring  in 295 patients; 211 (66%) episodes were community-acquired and 108 (34%) were nosocomial. the microoroganisms isolated most frequently from patients with community-acquired bacteraemic pneumonia were streptococcus pneumoniae (46%), staphylococcus aureus (10%) and haemophilus influenzae (8%); while pseudomonas spp. (17%), klebsiella spp. (11%) and staphylococcus aureus (10%) were isolated most often from the patients with nosocomial bacteraemic pneumonia. the median age of patients was 68 years (range, 0.003-100). the overall mortality was 34%. no significant difference was found between the mortality rates of patients with  community-acquired (31%) and nosocomial (40%) bacteraemic pneumonia (p=0.1). multivariate analysis showed that hypothermia, respiratory failure, impaired consciousness, tracheal intubation, staphylococcus aureus aetiology, septic shock, inappropriate empiric antibiotic treatment and age significantly increased mortality.

TI  == synthesis and microbiological activity of some n-(o-hydroxyphenyl)benzamides and  phenylacetamides as the possible metabolites of antimicrobial active benzoxazoles: part ii.
AB  == the synthesis of some n-(o-hydroxyphenyl)benzamides and benzacetamides (2a-2p) in order to determine their in vitro antimicrobial activity against two gram-positive bacteria, three gram-negative bacteria and the fungus candida albicans is described. the new compounds were compared with several control drugs. the derivative 2g, 4-amino-n-(o-hydroxyphenyl)benzamide, was found active  at an mic value of 25 microg/ml against the gram-negative microorganism klebsiella pneumoniae. most of the compounds exhibited antibacterial activity at  an mic value of 25 microg/ml against pseudomonas aureginosa. for the antifungal activity against c. albicans, compounds 2e, 2h and 2m were found more active than the other derivatives (mic 12.5 microg/ml). the antimicrobial activity of some of these benzamide and phenylacetamide derivatives (2a, 2b, 2f, 2g, 2h and 2k), possible metabolites of benzoxazoles, was also compared with that of the cyclic analogues 3-8. compound 2f possesses two dilutions better antifungal activity than its cyclic analogue the benzoxazole derivative 5 against c. albicans, while  having one dilution better antibacterial activity against streptococcus faecalis  and k. pneumoniae.

AB  == from the guts of new and old colonies (female and male) of mexican fruit flies, anastrepha ludens (diptera: tephritidae), we identified a total of 18 different bacterial species belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonadaceae, vibrionaceae, micrococcaceae, deinococcacea, bacillaceae, and the genus listeria. enterobacter, providencia, serratia, and staphylococcus spp. were the most frequently isolated genera, with citrobacter, streptococcus, aerococcus, and listeria found less frequently. we found bacillus cereus, enterobacter sakazakii, providencia stuartii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa only in the new colony, aeromonas hydrophila and klebsiella pneumoniae spp. pneumoniae only in the old colony. we also studied resistance/sensitivity to 12 antibiotics for six bacterial isolates such as enterobacter cloacae, e. sakazakii, k. pneumoniae spp., providencia rettgeri, p. aeruginosa, and bacillus cereus. isolates on the whole were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin (five of six isolates) and sensitive to rifampin and streptomycin (six of six isolates). antibiotic resistance profiles might be useful characteristics for distinguishing among species and strains of these bacteria, probably having ecological significance with respect to intra- and inter-specific competition within host cadavers, and could have implications for the utility of these organisms for biological control, including the alternative control strategy, paratransgenesis.

TI  == resistance patterns among nosocomial pathogens: trends over the past few years.
AB  == multiple surveillance studies have demonstrated that resistance among prevalent pathogens is increasing at an alarming rate, leading to greater patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial infections. among gram-positive organisms, the most important resistant pathogens are methicillin- (oxacillin-)resistant staphylococcus aureus, beta-lactam-resistant and multidrug-resistant pneumococci, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. important causes of gram-negative resistance include extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis, high-level third-generation  cephalosporin (amp c) beta-lactamase resistance among enterobacter species and citrobacter freundii, and multidrug-resistance genes observed in pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. in selecting an empiric treatment for a nosocomial infection, one should consider the prevalent resistance patterns. antimicrobials used for the treatment of nosocomial infections should be effective against any likely resistant pathogens and should  not further promote the development of resistance. recent data suggest that because of esbls and high-level amp c beta-lactamase resistances, use of third-generation cephalosporins may be ineffective in many patients with nosocomial infections. in addition, use of these agents may allow overgrowth of inherently resistant enterococci. the role of fluoroquinolones in the empiric treatment of nosocomial infections is also being limited by new resistance patterns and increasing resistance levels. available antimicrobials with good activity against many resistant pathogens include the carbapenems, piperacillin/tazobactam, and cefepime. in addition, several new agents with good  activity against gram-positive organisms are in development or have been recently released. appropriate antimicrobial selection, surveillance systems, and effective infection-control procedures are key partners in limiting antimicrobial-resistant pathogen occurrence and spread.

TI  == acute mastoiditis--the antibiotic era: a multicenter study.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the clinical course and identify the causative organisms  of acute mastoiditis in a community where most of the patients who develop acute  otitis media are treated with antibiotics. methods: a multicenter retrospective review of a series of 223 consecutive cases of acute mastoiditis. setting: nine secondary or tertiary academic or non-academic referral centers. results: prior to the diagnosis of acute mastoiditis, 121 of the patients (54.3%) had been receiving oral antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media for periods ranging from 1 to 21 days (mean 5.3 days). samples for bacterial culture were obtained from 152 patients. cultures were negative in 60 patients. the organisms isolated  in the 92 positive cultures were: streptococcus pneumoniae (15 patients), streptococcus pyogenes (14 patients), staphylococcus aureus (13 patients), staphylococcus coagulase negative (three patients), pseudomonas aeruginosa (eight patients), haemophilus influenzae (four patients), proteus mirabilis (two patients), escherichia coli (two patients), klebsiella pneumoniae (one patient),  enterobacter (one patient), acinetobacter (one patient), anaerobic gram-negative  bacilli (one patient), and fungi (two patients). ten patients had mixed flora. sixteen patients presented with complications (cerebellar abscess, perisinus empyema, subdural abscess or empyema, extradural abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, lateral sinus thrombosis, bacterial meningitis, labyrinthitis, petrositis, or facial nerve palsy). conclusions: antibiotic treatment cannot be considered an absolute safeguard against the development of acute mastoiditis. early myringotomy for acute otitis media seems to decrease the incidence of complications. the distribution of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis differs from that in acute otitis media. intracranial complications in acute mastoiditis are not rare. because of the diversity of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis and the growing resistance of bacteria to the various antibiotics, all means to obtain a sample for culture prior to antibiotic treatment, including general anesthesia.

AB  == the duration of time that serum levels are above the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic; t >mic) seems to be an important pharmacodynamic parameter for beta-lactams. the aim of this study was to evaluate the bactericidal activity of cefodizime and ceftriaxone in a pharmacokinetic model mimicking the concentrations in bronchial mucus and in serum (total and free) obtained at 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h, after 1 g i.m. administration once daily. the species investigated were respiratory pathogens (1 strain of staphylococcus aureus, 2 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 strain b-lactamase negative and 1 strain beta-lactamase positive of haemophilus influenzae, 1 strain of escherichia coli and 1 strain of klebsiella pneumoniae); mic50s of the chosen strains were reported. in this in vitro model the concentrations (serum and bronchial mucus) for both antibiotics are generally at or above the mic values of the tested strains until 24 hours. the killing curve showed rapid killing for both antibiotics: 99.9% killing (a 3-log reduction in growth) within 6 to 8 h, depending upon the microorganism tested. there was no significant difference in the log kill between cefodizime and ceftriaxone. these data confirm that t >mic for beta-lactams is the pharmacodynamic parameter which best correlates with bactericidal efficacy. on the basis of the killing curve determined for cefodizime versus ceftriaxone at concentrations that these antibiotics can reach  during therapy with 1 g i.m. once daily we expect reasonable clinical efficacy with monoadministration of cefodizime as well as for ceftriaxone in respiratory tract infections.

TI  == ability of laboratories to detect emerging antimicrobial resistance: proficiency  testing and quality control results from the world health organization's external quality assurance system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  == the accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility data submitted by microbiology laboratories to national and international surveillance systems has been debated  for a number of years. to assess the accuracy of data submitted to the world health organization by users of the whonet software, the centers for disease control and prevention distributed six bacterial isolates representing key antimicrobial-resistance phenotypes to approximately 130 laboratories, all but one of which were outside of the united states, for antimicrobial susceptibility  testing as part of the world health organization's external quality assurance system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. each laboratory also was asked to submit 10 consecutive quality control values for several key organism-drug combinations. most laboratories were able to detect methicillin (oxacillin) resistance in staphylococcus aureus, high-level vancomycin resistance in enterococcus faecium, and resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins in klebsiella pneumoniae. many laboratories, particularly those using disk diffusion tests, had difficulty in recognizing reduced susceptibility to penicillin in an isolate of streptococcus pneumoniae. the most difficult phenotype for laboratories to detect was reduced susceptibility to vancomycin in an isolate of  staphylococcus epidermidis. the proficiency testing challenge also included a request for biochemical identification of a gram-negative bacillus, which most laboratories recognized as enterobacter cloacae. although only a small subset of  laboratories have submitted their quality control data, it is clear that many of  these laboratories generate disk diffusion results for oxacillin when testing s.  aureus atcc 25923 and s. pneumoniae atcc 49619 that are outside of the acceptable quality control range. the narrow quality control range for vancomycin also proved to be a challenge for many of the laboratories submitting data; approximately 27% of results were out of range. thus, it is important to establish the proficiency of laboratories submitting data to surveillance systems in which the organisms are tested locally, particularly for penicillin resistance in pneumococci and glycopeptide resistance in staphylococci.

TI  == infections in e-beta thalassemia.
AB  == infection is a major complication and the leading cause of death in thalassemia,  especially e-beta thalassemia. the spectrum of infections in e-beta thalassemia include mild and severe infections, therapy-related infections such as yersinia enterocolitica infection associated with desferrioxamine (dfo) therapy, and transfusion-transmitted disease, as well as unique infections such as with pythiosis. prospective studies in thailand indicate that patients with e-beta thalassemia had more frequent episodes of both mild and severe infections. the former included upper respiratory tract infection, acute gastroenteritis, cutaneous abscess, and gingivitis. severe infections occurred more commonly in patients with splenectomy and included septicemia, pneumonia, biliary tract infection, salmonellosis, and urinary tract infection. responsible organisms were escherichia coli (26%), klebsiella pneumoniae (23%), salmonella (15%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (13%). other organisms included pseudomonas, staphylococci, burkholderia pseudomallei (melioidosis), and aeromonas. patients undergoing dfo therapy are at risk for y. enterocolitica infection which may be localized to mesenteric nodes and tonsils or occur as a generalized form such as  septicemia. recently, we have seen a unique infection so-called vascular pythiosis. patients usually presented with clinical features of vascular occlusion of lower limbs from ascending arteritis and thrombosis. the causative organism, pythium insidiosum, is fungus-like, in the kingdom stramenopila, and in the class oomycetes. the mortality rate is high and the only effective treatment  has been early amputation or possibly immunotherapy. the predisposing factors of  infections in thalassemia include splenectomy, iron overload, anemia, and granulocyte dysfunctions. general management of infections in thalassemia consist of prevention, i.e., immunization with pneumococcal and hepatitis vaccines, oral  penicillins especially in patients with splenectomy, removal of predisposing factors such as gallstones, iron overload, and appropriate antibiotics.

AB  == in two investigative phases over a 13.5-year study period (january 1986-june 1999), 202 adult patients with culture-proven bacterial meningitis were enrolled  in this study. in order to determine the epidemiologic trend, prognostic factors  and therapeutic results for this disease. klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae),  pseudomonas aeruginosa, and streptococcus pneumoniae were the three most commonly revealed pathogens, accounting for about 48% of the episodes. although there was  a change in relative frequency for the pathogens, k. pneumoniae remained the most prevalent during the two periods studied (january 1986-december 1992 and january  1993-june 1999). multiantibiotic resistant strains have been in evidence since their appearance in 1994, with most of our patients acquiring their infection nosocomially. the overall mortality rates during the two periods were 40% and 34%, respectively. in stepwise logistic regression analysis, only initial conscious level, appropriate antibiotic therapy and septic shock were independently associated with mortality, after adjustment for other potentially confounding factors. initial empirical antibiotics with both third-generation cephalosporin and penicillin g, should be considered for the majority of meningitis cases resulting from infection with gram-negative bacilli and streptococcal species. besides the evolution of newer pathogens, there has been increasing incidence for nosocomially acquired bacterial meningitis for patients  postneurosurgery, with the emergence of resistant strains presenting a therapeutic challenge in recent years. vancomycin and imipenem/cilastatin should  be considered as the initial empirical antibiotics of choice for the treatment of this special group of patients.

TI  == results of the 1997 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program in three brazilian  medical centers.
AB  == the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program began in january, 1997, and is designed to monitor nosocomial and selected community acquired infections via a worldwide surveillance network of sentinel hospitals distributed equally by geographic location and size. three sites in brazil - rio de janeiro, florianopolis, and sao paulo - participated in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program stet. rank order of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogenic species causing bloodstream infections, pneumonia, wound or skin and soft tissue infections, and urinary tract infections (uti) in hospitalized patients were determined by collecting consecutive isolates over a specified period of time. antimicrobial susceptibilities of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis obtained from outpatients with respiratory tract infections were also evaluated. the isolates for the evaluated infections were: 1) bloodstream - 20 consecutive isolates in each calendar month during a 12-month period; 2) pneumonia - 100 consecutive isolates over a 6 month period; 3) wound or skin and soft tissue - 50 consecutive isolates over a 3 month period; and 4) uti - 50 consecutive isolates over a 3 month period. each hospital also contributed, over a 6 month period, consecutive  clinically significant outpatient isolates (one isolate per patient) of s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, and m. catarrhalis that were considered pathogens in respiratory tract infections. data collected for each isolate included species identification, antimicrobial susceptibility profile, date of isolation, and specimen type. molecular studies were performed on selected isolates. a total of  1,241 bacterial strains were obtained; the majority were cultured from hospitalized patients, while 139 were fastidious organisms from community acquired respiratory tract infections. gram-negative bacilli and s. aureus were the predominant pathogens, and enterobacter spp. was a significant pathogen. the  predominance of p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. and the significant levels of resistance to most agents are of major concern, as is the epidemic rate of esbl-producing strains of klebsiella spp. and e. coli in brazil, which is much higher than rates seen in other areas of the world. resistance among p. aeruginosa and the enterobacteriaceae to fluoroquinolones, oxacillin-resistant s. aureus, and penicillin- and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-resistant pneumococci were other significant resistance issues identified in this surveillance study. vancomycin resistance among the enterococci, s. aureus, and s. pneumoniae was not identified. this benchmark study will serve as comparison for future surveillance studies, including the ongoing sentry program, to monitor emerging resistance trends in brazil. the high rates of resistance observed in this study underscore  the need for global surveillance and local action.

TI  == immunostimulating and protective effects of an oral polybacterial immunomodulator 'dentavax' in a rabbit experimental model.
AB  == the immunostimulating and protective effects of an oral polybacterial immunomodulator, dentavax (d), composed of killed cells from klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans and lactobacillus acidophilus and their lysates, have been investigated on an experimental rabbit model. in this model, mixed suspensions of the above bacterial wild strains have been injected in six sides of oral mucosa. a long-lasting inflammation with the development of infiltrates and confluating abscesses has been observed. the influence of orally given dentavax on the course of the model infection as well as on the dynamics of the immune response has been studied. a two-fold decrease in the duration and severity of inflammatory reaction, confirmed by the histological findings, has been registered. in immunised animals, an activation of polymorphonuclear phagocytosis, together with stimulation of humoral systemic and mucosal immunity with synthesis of specific serum (predominantly, igg) and coproantibodies (predominantly, s-iga) determined  by elisa, has been found. the results obtained proved the strong immunostimulating and protective effects of the preparation d, which is meant for the prophylaxis and treatment of inflammatory periodontal diseases.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. special references to bacteria isolated between april 1997  and march 1998].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 19 facilities in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained during the period from april 1997 to march 1998. the number of cases investigated as objectives was 215 for one year. a total of 420 strains (170 strains from primary infections and 250 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 174 cases (80.9% of total cases). in primary infections, the isolation rate  of anaerobic bacteria was higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of aerobic gram-positive bacteria and pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by staphylococcus aureus, which was frequently isolated from postoperative infections. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was most predominantly isolated  from primary infections, followed by p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. we found neither vancomycin nor arbekacin resistant strains of s.  aureus, and found no vancomycin resistant strains of enterococcus spp. the susceptibility of p. aeruginosa against carbapenems did not decline in the year 1997, while resistance of b. fragilis group against cephems advanced increasingly.

TI  == evaluation of the in vitro activity of 9 antimicrobials against bacterial strains isolated from patients in intensive care units in brazil: mystic antimicrobial surveillance program.
AB  == multi-resistant bacterial strains are increasingly prevalent in hospital environments. bacterial resistance is an important problem, especially for practitioners in intensive care units (icus) because of the selective pressure on the prevalent bacteria in these environments. the mystic (meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection) study has been monitoring the performance of carbapenems and other antibiotics in different hospitals for at least 3 years. the in vitro activities of meropenem, imipenem, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, piperacilin/tazobactam, gentamicin, and tobramycin were compared against 452 recent clinical aerobic isolates. the isolates consisted of 19 species of gram-negative bacteria (n=290) including k. pneumoniae (n=49), e. coli (n=48), a. baumannii (n=47), enterobacter spp. (n=41), and p. aeruginosa (n=33) and 9 species of gram-positive bacteria (n=162) including staphylococcus aureus (n=63), enterococcus faecalis (n=22), streptococcus pneumoniae (n=22) and coagulase negative staphylococci (n=21). all  isolates were collected from icu patients. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by etest methodology, using standardized and controlled procedures. meropenem and imipenem showed the lowest mic(90) for all species tested. gram-negative isolates showed the following overall resistance percentages to the other 7 drugs: tobramycin (43.1%), cefotaxime (38.6%), gentamicin (34.1%), ceftazidime (31.7%), ciprofloxacin (25.5%), piperacillin/tazobactam (26.9%), and cefepime (18.6%). carbapenems were the most  active drugs overall and only p. aeruginosa presented some degree of resistance (18.2%). we also evaluated the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) among all enterobacteriaceae members (n=176) by etest/esbl strip. esbl production was detected in 51 strains (29.0%). among them, klebsiella pneumoniae  was the most prevalent at 59.2%, followed by enterobacter spp. (19.5%) and e. coli (14.6%). the high level of resistance against several antimicrobials and the alarming rate of esbl production may restrict therapeutic choice to the carbapenems in this selected group of patients.

TI  == antibiotic bacterial resistance in ambulatory patients.
AB  == background: this study evaluates trends in antibiotic resistance in patients who  were treated in an ambulatory setting. methods: the authors compiled the data from all lower respiratory track(sputum) cultures collected from ambulatory patients who visited the olmsted medical center and mayo clinic between 1985 and  1998. cultured organisms were identified, and minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values were presented and categorized as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant based on the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) guidelines for mic and antibiotic susceptibility. results: 4,297 potentially pathogenic organisms were obtained from sputum cultures for 1,921 patients. the most discernible changes in antibiotic resistance appeared to be in cultures positive for pseudomonas aeruginosa. a trend toward increasing resistance of isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae to beta-lactam drugs was observed in a portion of the population. an emerging intermediate susceptibility  among isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudoumonas species was noted. conclusions: trends in antimicrobial resistance of respiratory pathogens from ambulatory patients are less clear than those from hospitalized patients, but must be monitored because of the high percentage of ambulatory patients who receive empirical therapies. trends in intermediate susceptibility patterns may help reveal emerging antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == bifidobacterium strains from resident infant human gastrointestinal microflora exert antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background and aims: the gastrointestinal microflora exerts a barrier effect against enteropathogens. the aim of this study was to examine if bifidobacteria,  a major species of the human colonic microflora, participates in the barrier effect by developing antimicrobial activity against enterovirulent bacteria. methods: antibacterial activity was examined in vitro against a wide range of gram negative and gram positive pathogens. inhibition of salmonella typhimurium sl1334 cell association and cell invasion was investigated in vitro using caco-2  cells. colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract in vivo by bifidobacteria was examined in axenic c3/he/oujco mice. antimicrobial activity was examined in vivo  in axenic c3/he/oujco mice infected by the lethal s typhimurium c5 strain. results: fourteen human bifidobacterium strains isolated from infant stools were  examined for antimicrobial activity. two strains (ca1 and f9) expressed antagonistic activity against pathogens in vitro, inhibited cell entry, and killed intracellular s typhimurium sl1344 in caco-2 cells. an antibacterial component(s) produced by ca1 and f9 was found to be a lipophilic molecule(s) with a molecular weight of less than 3500. in the axenic c3/he/oujco mice, ca1 and f9  strains colonised the intestinal tract and protected mice against s typhimurium c5 lethal infection. conclusion: several bifidobacterium strains from resident infant human gastrointestinal microflora exert antimicrobial activity, suggesting that they could participate in the "barrier effect" produced by the indigenous microflora.

TI  == ability of laboratories to detect emerging antimicrobial resistance in nosocomial pathogens: a survey of project icare laboratories.
AB  == a proficiency testing project was conducted among 48 microbiology laboratories participating in project icare (intensive care antimicrobial resistance epidemiology). all laboratories correctly identified the staphylococcus aureus challenge strain as oxacillin- resistant and an enterococcus faecium strain as vancomycin-resistant. thirty-one (97%) of 32 laboratories correctly reported the  streptococcus pneumoniae strain as erythromycin-resistant. all laboratories testing the pseudomonas aeruginosa strain against ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin correctly reported the organism as resistant. of 40 laboratories, 30 (75%) correctly reported resistant mics or zone sizes for the imipenem- and meropenem-resistant serratia marcescens. for the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strain of klebsiella pneumoniae, 18 (42%) of 43 laboratories testing ceftazidime correctly reported ceftazidime mics in the resistant range. these results suggest that current testing generally produces accurate results, although some laboratories have difficulty detecting resistance to carbapenems and extended-spectrum cephalosporins. this highlights the need for monitoring how well susceptibility test systems in clinical laboratories detect emerging resistance.

TI  == nucleotide sequence, expression and transcriptional analysis of the bifidobacterium longum mb 219 lacz gene.
AB  == the gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of escherichia coli from bifidobacterium longum mb219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten bifidobacterium strains tested of the species b. longum, b. breve, b. adolescentis, b. indicum, b. animalis and b. cuniculi. the nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to e. coli revealed the presence of a lacz-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site.  a sequence showing 72% identity with the proline trna of bacillus subtilis and a  gene probably encoding the dna-3-methyladenine glycosydase i were located downstream from the lacz gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. by primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacz gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the  -10 region of the putative promoter. the nucleotide sequence of lacz and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes  and enzymes from other microorganisms. high similarity was demonstrated between the b. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, e. coli, clostridium acetobutylicum, leuconostoc lactis, klebsiella pneumoniae and kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the lacz family. the b. longum mb219 lacz gene was cloned in bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. the expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.

TI  == differential host susceptibility to pulmonary infections with bacteria and fungi  in mice deficient in myeloperoxidase.
AB  == myeloperoxidase (mpo), which is located within neutrophils capable of producing hypochlorous acid, is active in vitro against bacteria and fungi. however, mpo-deficient persons are usually healthy. to define the in vivo contribution of  mpo to early host defense against pulmonary infections, mpo-deficient and control mice were intranasally infected with various fungi and bacteria, and the number of residual microorganisms in lungs was compared 48 h later. mpo-deficient mice showed severely reduced cytotoxicity to candida albicans, candida tropicalis, trichosporon asahii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. however, the mutant mice showed  a slight but significantly delayed clearance of aspergillus fumigatus and klebsiella pneumoniae and had comparable levels of resistance to the wild type against candida glabrata, cryptococcus neoformans, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae. these results suggest that the mpo-dependent oxidative  system is important for host defense against fungi and bacteria, although the effect varies by pathogen species.

AB  == during the period from 1984 to 1997, 85 bacterial meningitis neonates with positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures were treated. the ages of these patients ranged from 1 to 28 days. the male to female ratio was 1.7 to 1. the most common  causative agent was group b beta-hemolytic streptococci (gbs, 31.8%), followed by escherichia coli (20%), proteus mirabilis (7.1%), enterobacter cloacae (5.9%), other streptococci excluding streptococcus pneumoniae (5.9%), chryseobacterium meningosepticum (5.9%), enterococci (4.7%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (3.5%). among the 85 patients treated, 51 (60%) were younger than 7 days old. among them, dyspnea was the most common clinical manifestation. in contrast, fever and diarrhea were seen more frequently in neonates with late onset of disease (after  seven days of age). ampicillin and cefotaxime were the most commonly used antibiotics. the most frequently encountered complications were hydrocephalus and seizures. since 1991, gbs has overtaken e. coli as the leading cause of neonatal  bacterial meningitis. this was accompanied by a fall in the mortality rate, but a sustained high incidence of complications and sequelae. the results of this study highlight the importance of developing strategies to prevent group b streptococcal infection.

TI  == [susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (1998)].
AB  == the bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected by institutions located throughout japan, since 1981. ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and analyzed some characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. results obtained from these investigations are discussed. in these 18 institutions around the entire japan, 532 strains of presumably etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 438 patients with lower respiratory tract infections during the period from october in 1998 to september in 1999. mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 85 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 100  strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 96 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 75 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 6 strains of pseudomonas  aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 38 strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, 26 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the susceptibilities of 517 strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. s. aureus strains for which mics of oxacillin (mpipc) were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) accounted for 60.0%. vancomycin (vcm) and arbekacin (abk) showed the most potent activities against mrsa. but one of mrsa showed resistance to abk with the mic of 64 micrograms/ml.  the sensitive strains of mrsa to vcm have decreased. the frequency of penicillin  (pc)-intermediate s. pneumoniae (pisp) + pc-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) have increased in 46.0% for 1998 comparatively from 30.9% of 1997's. but prsp decreased, and pisp increased into 39.0% of 1998 years from 19.8% of 1997's. panipenem (papm), imipenem (ipm) and faropenem (frpm) showed the most potent activities against s. pneumoniae with mic80s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. against h. influenzae and m. (b.) catarrhalis, almost all the drugs showed good activities. the sensitive strains of them against ceftazidime (caz) decreased in  1997, but those have increased in 1998. inversely, the susceptibility of them against cefotiam (ctm) had been higher in 1997, but those have been lower in 1998. tobramycin (tob) showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and nonmucoid strains). all drugs except ampicillin (abpc) were active against k. pneumoniae. a quite few of k. pneumoniae showed low susceptibilities. also, we investigated year to year changes in the characteristics of patients, their respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology. the examination of age distribution indicated that the proportion of patients with ages over 70 years was 48.6% of all the patients showing a slight increase in every year. about the proportion of diagnosed diseases as follows: bacterial pneumonia was the most frequent with 40.2%. the ratio of it has increased slightly, and the increased rate was 10% in patients with ages over 70  years compared with the results in 1997. chronic bronchitis have decreased slightly with 27.6% in 1998. number of strains isolated from patients before administration of antibiotics were more than those after administration of them in chronic bronchitis, but these were almost same number in bacterial pneumonia.  administration of antibiotics has changed the results of the frequency of isolation of bacterial species. bacterial isolations before administration of antibiotics were as follows: s. pneumoniae 26.7%, h. influenzae 23.8%, s. aureus  13.3% and m. (b.) catarrhalis 10.8%. the frequencies of s. aureus decreased after antibiotics administration over 15 days, but the frequencies of p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) was not affected. the frequencies of p. aeruginosa was 45.5% after administration over 15 days. the frequencies of s. pneumoniae decreased upon administration of antibiotics, these were only 4.5% over 15 days.  the frequencies of h.

TI  == neonatal meningitis.
AB  == objective: to determine the prevalent bacterial agents of neonatal meningitis and their antibiotic susceptibility in a referral intensive care unit in assir central hospital, saudi arabia, during the years 1993-1998. methods: records of newborn infants with positive cerebrospinal fluid culture during the period were  retrospectively studied. results: there were 1473 nursery admissions, of which 32 episodes of meningitis occurred amongst 31 neonates. klebsiella pneumoniae (31%)  and serratia marcescens (21%) were the main pathogens. the incidence of concurrent septicemia among these infants was 58%. klebsiella pneumoniae appears  to dominate in both early and late onset infections. the sex incidence was equal  and the mortality rate was 48%. conclusion: the survey identifies klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia sp. as the leading bacterial agents of neonatal meningitis in our environment. the relatively high frequency of serratia infection in the present survey appears unique as this organism is comparatively  rare in other reports across the globe. no group b streptococcus was isolated, which is in contrast to reports obtained in europe, america and australia where it is the predominant organism of neonatal sepsis or meningitis. antibiogram identified imipenem and cefotaxime as the empirical antibiotics in infants with a clinical diagnosis of neonatal sepsis in our hospital; no more conventional use of ampicillin. in view of the changing bacterial pattern of infant infection with time even in the same environment, a periodic review of this subject is advocated.

TI  == microbiologic features of adult community-acquired bacterial meningitis in taiwan.
AB  == background and purpose: community-acquired bacterial meningitis (cabm) is a life-threatening disease that requires prompt initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy. the purpose of this study was to determine the causative microorganisms of cabm and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns at a major teaching hospital in taipei from 1993 to 1998. methods: a review of medical records and microbiologic data was used to identify cases of cabm and causative pathogens. antimicrobial susceptibility testing for bacterial isolates was performed by the disk diffusion method. results: among the 48 adult patients with a diagnosis of cabm during the study period, the causative pathogens were identified in 36 cases. unlike reports from other countries, klebsiella pneumoniae was the leading causative pathogen (33%), followed by streptococcus pneumoniae (28%), listeria monocytogenes (11%), neisseria meningitidis (6%), staphylococcus aureus (6%), streptococci (6%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%). the incidence of cabm due to k. pneumoniae increased during the study period (p = 0.012, poisson regression), while the incidence of cabm due to other pathogens remained stable. all of the cabm-associated k. pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to cefotaxime but 25% of the cabm-associated s. pneumoniae strains were not susceptible to penicillin g. conclusions: penicillin g alone was not an  appropriate empiric therapy for adult cabm because a high percentage of cases were due to k. pneumoniae or penicillin nonsusceptible s. pneumoniae. while the recommendations for the initial empiric regimen for cabm due to s. pneumoniae in  taiwan remain to be developed, third-generation cephalosporins appear to be an appropriate initial empiric regimen for the treatment of cabm due to k. pneumoniae.

TI  == respiratory tract pathogens isolated from patients hospitalized with suspected pneumonia: frequency of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (united states and canada, 1997).
AB  == thirty-seven sentinel hospitals (29 in the united states [us]; eight in canada) collected bacterial isolates from hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of pneumonia. the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of these pathogens were determined to more than 60 agents (40 reported) using the reference broth microdilution method described by the national committee for clinical laboratory  standards. the five most frequently recorded species among the 2757 isolates collected during the study were (no. tested/%): staphylococcus aureus (632/22.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (498/18. 1%), haemophilus influenzae (284/10.3%), klebsiella spp. (240/8.7%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (213/7.7%). there was a significant difference in the susceptibility to antimicrobials between the us and canada for s. aureus to oxacillin (50.1% versus 93.8% susceptible, respectively), gentamicin (78.7% versus 97.8%), and fluoroquinolones (49.5 to 53.0% versus 89.8 to 94.9%). amikacin (92. 8% susceptible) was the most  active antimicrobial agent against p. aeruginosa, and meropenem was the most potent beta-lactam. against h. influenzae, most drugs retained a high level of activity, whilst against the s. pneumoniae, only the newer fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, sparfloxacin) remained highly effective in vitro. only two antimicrobial agents (imipenem and meropenem) were >99% active against the klebsiella spp. and enterobacter spp. isolated in this survey (possess extended spectrum beta-lactamases or hyperproduction of amp c cephalosporins); cefepime (95.6-100.0% susceptible) was significantly more active than other cephalosporins tested. clonal, epidemic outbreaks of multiply resistant strains were very rare in monitored hospitals. in conclusion, important differences exist between the us and canada in the susceptibility patterns of some respiratory tract pathogens to commonly used antimicrobial agents with canadian strains generally being more susceptible to currently available antimicrobial agents.

TI  == use of pcr with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == we have designed a universal pcr capable of amplifying a portion of the 16s rrna  gene of eubacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. the sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most pcr products generated by haeiii digestion were different. pcr products from s. aureus and s. epidermidis could not be digested by haeiii but yielded different patterns when they were digested with mnli. pcr products from s. pneumoniae, e. faecium, and e. faecalis yielded the same haeiii digestion pattern but could be differentiated by alui digestion. pcr  products from e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and e. cloacae also had the  same haeiii digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with ddei  or bstbi. this universal pcr could detect as few as 10 e. coli or 250 s. aureus organisms. compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal pcr for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. these results suggest that this universal pcr coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.

TI  == in vitro activity of difloxacin against canine bacterial isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of difloxacin against canine bacterial isolates from clinical cases was studied in the united states and the netherlands. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic), the postantibiotic effect, the effect of ph on antimicrobial activity, and the bacterial killing rate tests were determined according to standard techniques. the mics of american and dutch isolates agreed  in general. the mics of the american gram-negative isolates ranged from 0.06 to 2.0 microg/ml, and the mics of the dutch gram-negative isolates ranged from 0.016 to 8.0 microg/ml. a few european strains of proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae had relatively high mics. bordetella bronchiseptica also was less susceptible to difloxacin. the mics of the american gram-positive cocci ranged from 0.125 to 4.0 microg/ml, and the mics of dutch isolates ranged from 0.125 to  2.0 microg/ ml. difloxacin induced a concentration-dependent postantibiotic effect that lasted 0.2-3 hours in cultures with escherichia coli, staphylococcus  intermedius, streptococcus canis, proteus spp., and klebsiella pneumoniae. there  was no postantibiotic effect observed against canine pseudomonas aeruginosa. decreasing the ph of the medium increased the mic of proteus mirabilis for difloxacin. the mics of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were lowest at neutral ph and were slightly increased in acid or alkaline media. at a neutral ph, most tested bacterial species were killed at a difloxacin concentration of 4  times the mic. similar results were obtained when these same bacteria were tested against enrofloxacin. a klebsiella pneumoniae strain in an acidic environment was readily killed at difloxacin or enrofloxacin mic, but at neutral ph the drug concentration had to be raised to 4 times the mic for a bactericidal effect. after 24 hours of incubation at ph 7.1, difloxacin and enrofloxacin had similar bactericidal activity for all bacteria tested except staphylococcus intermedius.  against s. intermedius, difloxacin was more bactericidal than enrofloxacin.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the usa.
AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

AB  == the postantibiotic effect (pae), sub-mic effect (sme) and postantibiotic sub-mic  effect (pasme) of moxifloxacin were investigated in an in-vitro dynamic model reproducing in-vivo elimination kinetics of the antibiotic. the pae was induced by exposing strains of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae to 5 x mic of the antibiotic for 1.5 hours. after induction, cultures were washed to eliminate the antibiotic and resuspended into the dynamic model either in the presence or absence of a subinhibitory concentration of the antibacterial agent of 0.5 x mic. unexposed controls were treated similarly. pasmes were constantly longer than corresponding smes, but differences between them were not statistically significant. both pasmes (mean 11:17 hours, range from 8:17 to 14:57) and smes (mean 9:23 hours, range from 6:03 to 12:34) had an initial bactericidal effect and were significantly longer than paes (mean 1:31 hours, range from 0:21 to 2:14). the primary effect of moxifloxacin sub-mics appears to be prevalent in pae. the possibility of once-daily dosing of the drug is strengthened.

TI  == multilocus enzyme analysis in aerobic and anaerobic bacteria using gel electrophoresis-nitrocellulose blotting.
AB  == an optimized multilocus enzyme electrophoresis method, which involves polyacrylamide-agarose gel electrophoresis followed by electrophoretic transfers  on nitrocellulose sheets, was developed for the analysis of enzyme polymorphism in several aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, klebsiella pneumoniae and k. oxytoca, clostridium bifermentans and c. sordellii, and prevotella bivia. serial  electrophoretic transfers (during 5-15 min each) from a single polyacrylamide gel could be achieved for most enzymes studied, and allowed an increased definition of enzyme bands on nitrocellulose as compared to migration gels. four enzymes, which could not be blotted in such conditions, could still be stained in gels after blotting. thus, the method allowed the combined analysis of several enzymes after a single gel electrophoresis separation. the analysis of enzyme polymorphism in the various species studied raised the interest of polymorphic loci such as esterase or glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase for epidemiologic studies. the method characterized a genetic diversity of enzyme loci of s. pneumoniae higher than previously reported, and is thus convenient for the analysis of genetic relationships between related isolates. since the present method reduces the tediousness of multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and requires  experimental conditions that are not specific for the bacterial population studied, it may be proposed for rapid population genetics analysis of a wide variety of bacteria.

AB  == the in vivo pharmacodynamic activities of two glycylcyclines (gar-936 and way 152,288) were assessed in an experimental murine thigh infection model in neutropenic mice. mice were infected with one of several strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, or klebsiella pneumoniae. most infections were treated with a twice-daily dosing schedule, with administration of 0.75 to 192 mg of gar-936 or way 152,288 per kg of body weight. a maximum-effect dose-response model was used to calculate the dose that produced a net bacteriostatic effect over 24 h of therapy. this dose was called the bacteriostatic dose. more extensive dosing studies were performed with s. pneumoniae 1199, e. coli atcc 25922, and k. pneumoniae atcc 43816, with doses being given as one, two, four, or eight equal doses over a period of 24 h. the dosing schedules were designed in order to minimize the interrelationship between the various pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters studied. these parameters were time above 0.03 to 32 times the mic, area under the concentration-time curve (auc), and maximum concentration of drug in serum (c(max)). the bacteriostatic dose remained essentially the same, irrespective of  the dosing frequency, for s. pneumoniae 1199 (0.3 to 0.9 mg/kg/day). for e. coli  atcc 25922 and k. pneumoniae atcc 43816, however, more frequent dosing led to lower bacteriostatic doses. pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated dose-dependent elimination half-lives of 1.05 to 2.34 and 1.65 to 3.36 h and serum protein bindings of 59 and 71% for gar-936 and way 152,288, respectively. gar-936 and way 152,288 were similarly effective against the microorganisms studied, with small differences in maximum effect and 50% effective dose. the glycylcyclines were also similarly effective against tetracycline-sensitive and tetracycline-resistant bacteria. time above a certain factor (range, 0.5 to 4 times) of the mic was a better predictor of in vivo efficacy than c(max) or auc for most organism-drug combinations. the results demonstrate that in order to achieve 80% maximum efficacy, the concentration of unbound drug in serum should be maintained above the mic for at least 50% of the time for gar-936 and for at least 75% of the time for way 152,288. the results of these experiments will aid  in the rational design of dose-finding studies for these glycylcyclines in humans.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility and frequency of occurrence of clinical blood isolates in europe from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, 1997 and 1998.
AB  == as part of the european arm of the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, 25  european university hospitals referred 9613 blood isolates for in vitro testing against >20 antimicrobial agents. escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae were the 5 most frequent isolates and accounted for two-thirds of all  referrals, with minor regional variation. of these, approximately 0.36% of e. coli and 16.7% of k. pneumoniae isolates proved to be potential extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers, and their incidence clearly varied regionally. quinolone resistance was detected among gram-negative species; in particular, p.  aeruginosa and acinetobacter species. considerable regional variation was observed in the incidences of methicillin resistance in s. aureus and penicillin  resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae. the incidence of vancomycin resistance in enterococci was relatively low overall and primarily associated with enterococcus faecium. however, extrapolation of these data to smaller and nonteaching hospitals should be undertaken with caution, since resistance rates may be lower  in these facilities.

TI  == respiratory pathogens: assessing resistance patterns in europe and the potential  role of grepafloxacin as treatment of patients with infections caused by these organisms.
AB  == although most respiratory tract infections (rti) are caused by viruses, various bacteria, particularly streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, are common causes of community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, otitis media and sinusitis. empirical antibiotic therapy of patients with rti must take account of the increasing prevalence of resistance among the predominant pathogens. europe-wide susceptibility surveillance studies have revealed that resistance to penicillin and macrolides is highly prevalent among isolates of s. pneumoniae from france and spain. uniquely, in italy, macrolide resistance is highly prevalent while the prevalence of penicillin resistance is low. resistance to other antibiotic classes, including chloramphenicol, doxycycline and, in particular, co-trimoxazole, is associated with penicillin resistance in pneumococci, but resistance to the fluoroquinolones is rare. beta-lactamase production is the principal mechanism of resistance in isolates of h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis, with fluoroquinolone resistance being detected rarely in these pathogens. in 1998 a surveillance study involving 15 european countries determined the susceptibilities of many respiratory pathogens to a range of antimicrobials, including grepafloxacin. the mic(90) of grepafloxacin for 1251 isolates of s. pneumoniae was 0.25 mg/l, the mics for only five strains being >2  mg/l, and 99.4% of all of the isolates tested were inhibited by concentrations </=0.5 mg/l. the mic(90)s of grepafloxacin for 587 isolates of h. influenzae and  323 of haemophilus parainfluenzae were 0.015 and 0.06 mg/l, respectively, while that for 509 isolates of m. catarrhalis was 0.03 mg/l. the mic(90)s for 1164 isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and 435 isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.12 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. other studies have shown grepafloxacin to be highly active against clinical isolates of legionella pneumophila (mic(90) 0.015 mg/l), mycoplasma pneumoniae (mic(90) 0.5 mg/l) and chlamydia pneumoniae (mics 0.06-0.12 mg/l). current susceptibility data indicate  that fluoroquinolone resistance rates among bacterial respiratory tract pathogens are low in european countries. the enhanced potency and activity of grepafloxacin against isolates of s. pneumoniae, including those exhibiting resistance to unrelated classes of antibiotics, together with its activity against other respiratory tract pathogens, suggest that this drug has considerable potential as empirical therapy of patients with a wide range of rti.

TI  == pyogenic psoas abscess: analysis of 27 cases.
AB  == from 1993 to 1998, 29 pyogenic psoas abscesses occurring in 27 patients were seen in taichung veterans general hospital. their age range was 25 to 85 years. diabetes mellitus was the leading underlying disease. fever and pain in the flank area, back and hip were the usual manifestations. the duration of symptoms prior  to the diagnosis ranged from 3 days to 6 months. most abscesses were diagnosed by computed tomography (ct) images and proven by abscess cultures, which were divided into primary and secondary types. eighteen of 29 abscesses were regarded  as primary. staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen in the primary abscesses, followed by streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, viridans streptococci, s. epidermidis, and salmonella spp.. in the secondary abscess category, e. coli was the leading organism in this series, followed by s. aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, viridans streptococci and candida albicans. the associated conditions included epidural abscess, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, perirenal  abscess, pulmonary tuberculosis, empyema, hydronephrosis and trauma history. the  initial empiric therapy comprised mostly of cefazolin or oxacillin with or without an aminoglycoside. thirteen patients underwent percutaneous drainage, while six received surgical debridement, including two with a recurrent abscess.  one patient had both drainage and debridement. others received medical treatment  only. two of the patients with primary abscess died in spite of percutaneous drainage. therefore, open drainage, besides appropriate antibiotic treatment, is  still required to control complex abscesses with sepsis.

TI  == an additional dose of cefazolin for intraoperative prophylaxis.
AB  == we examined the pancreatic tissue concentrations of cefazolin in ten patients undergoing pancreatectomy, and determined the optimal intraoperative time to deliver a repeat dose of cefazolin. an intravenous bolus dose of 1 g cefazolin was administered at the time of skin incision. peripheral blood, subcutaneous adipose tissue, and peritoneal samples were obtained intraoperatively every hour  for 4 h after the antibiotic was first administered, and pancreatic tissue samples were obtained at the time of pancreatectomy. to determine adequate tissue levels of cefazolin, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were measured for four bacterial species, namely 360 isolates of methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), 204 isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, 314 isolates of escherichia coli, and 30 isolates of streptococcus spp. the antibiotic concentrations in adipose tissue and peritoneum 3 h after the administration of cefazolin were lower than the mic80 for k. pneumoniae, e. coli, and streptococcus spp. most pancreatic tissue samples showed antibiotic concentrations greater than the mic80 for these bacterial species; however, those from four patients complicated by severe chronic pancreatitis, massive intraoperative bleeding, or obesity showed concentrations lower than the mic80. thus, we recommend that a second dose of cefazolin be given 3 h after the first administration to maintain  adequate levels of antibiotic activity.

TI  == mannose-binding lectin binds to a range of clinically relevant microorganisms and promotes complement deposition.
AB  == mannose-binding lectin (mbl) is a collagenous serum lectin believed to be of importance in innate immunity. genetically determined low levels of the protein are known to predispose to infections. in this study the binding of purified mbl  to pathogens isolated from immunocompromised children was investigated by flow cytometry. diverse candida species, aspergillus fumigatus, staphylococcus aureus, and beta-hemolytic group a streptococci exhibited strong binding of mbl, whereas  escherichia coli, klebsiella species, and haemophilus influenzae type b were characterized by heterogeneous binding patterns. in contrast, beta-hemolytic group b streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus epidermidis showed low levels of binding. bound mbl was able to promote c4 deposition in a concentration-dependent manner. we conclude that mbl may be of importance in first-line immune defense against several important pathogens.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of selected cyclic dipeptides.
AB  == cyclic dipeptides are products of rational drug design, which may exhibit both antimicrobial and antitumor properties. the aim of this study was to investigate  both the antimicrobial effects of the cyclic dipeptides cyclo(l-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl), cyclo(l-tyrosyl-l-prolyl), cyclo(l-tryptophanyl-l-prolyl) and cyclo(l-tryptophanyl-l-tryptophanyl) and the effects of these cyclic dipeptides on the gastrointestinal epithelium in vitro. furthermore, a relevant solvent for the possible pharmaceutical application of the products was sought concurrently. the antimicrobial effect of the cyclic dipeptides was assayed using the kirby-bauer disc diffusion assay against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pneumoniae, candida albicans, aspergillus niger and penicillium notatum. the effect of the cyclic dipeptides on the gastrointestinal epithelium was assessed by changes in alkaline phosphatase expression of ht-29 cells. cyclo(pro-trp) and cyclo(phe-pro) show broad spectrum  antibacterial properties and cyclo(trp-pro) and cyclo(trp-trp) show broad spectrum antifungal properties. the maturation of the gastrointestinal cells was  enhanced by cyclo(phe-pro), cyclo(tyr-pro), cyclo(trp-trp) and cyclo(trp-pro). the activity of these cyclic dipeptides thus indicates potential application of these compounds as pharmacological agents.

TI  == cure of implantable venous port-associated bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology-oncology patients without catheter removal.
AB  == the efficacy of antibiotic treatment of port-associated bloodstream infection without device removal has not been systematically studied. we analyzed the outcome of 43 consecutive port-associated bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology-oncology patients. etiologies included staphylococcus epidermidis (30) and staphylococcus aureus (6). antibiotics were given through the port for a median of 11 days. four ports were removed within 72 hours. in 36 (92%) of the remaining 39 episodes, there was a response to antibiotic therapy (defervescence  and negative blood culture). in 78% of episodes in which there was a response (excluding two in which the catheters were removed because of mechanical problems), the infections were cured without port removal. two of the four relapses were cured with a second course of antibiotics. the cure rate was 92% for s. epidermidis infections and 67% for s. aureus infections. thus, the majority of port-associated bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology-oncology patients can be cured without device removal.

TI  == bacterial colonization of central airways after stenting.
AB  == airway stenting (as) is increasingly used in the management of obstructive lesions of the central airways. although retention of secretions and infection have been reported as complications of as, the microbiological consequences of as have not yet been evaluated. in this study, we prospectively performed protected  specimen brush (psb) sampling of the airways, before and 3 to 4 wk after as, in 14 consecutive patients (65 +/- 17 yr), suffering from bronchial (5), extensive esophageal (2), thyroid (1), and adenocystic (1) carcinoma, stenotic tracheal burn lesions (2), postintubation stenosis (2), and wegener's granulomatosis (1).  a cutoff value of >/= 10(2) colony-forming units (cfu). ml(-)(1) was considered diagnostic for airway colonization (ac). psb results were related to the presence and degree of secretion retention (sr) at the level of the stent. in five of the  14 patients, ac was present prior to as; in three of these, potentially pathogenic microorganisms (ppm) were identified. after as, ac was found in 11 (including seven patients without prior ac) of the 14 patients. in six of these patients, one or more ppm were present (pseudomonas aeruginosa [4], staphylococcus aureus [3], streptococcus pneumoniae [1], klebsiella spp. [1]). although ac tended to be associated with the presence of sr (psb >/= 10(2) cfu. ml(-)(1) in 10 of 12 sr-positive and in zero sr-negative cases; psb < 10(2) cfu.  ml(-)(1) in two sr-positive and in two sr-negative cases), statistical significance was not reached (fisher exact test, p = 0.06). we conclude that as is frequently followed by ac, the majority of which occurs in patients without ac prior to as, and is caused by ppm. in no case, however, ac was associated with clinical signs of infection. ac tended to be associated with sr in the stent.

TI  == antibacterial properties of a silver chloride-coated nylon wound dressing.
AB  == objective: a silver chloride-coated nylon wound dressing (ag-wd) was evaluated in vitro for antimicrobial activity against five common equine wound pathogens. study design: bacterial susceptibility study. sample population: equine wound pathogens: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus, and staphylococcus aureus. methods:  an inoculum of each pathogen was incubated directly with ag-wd and quantitated after 24 to 48 hours of incubation. to determine if bactericidal activity of ag-wd was contact dependent, an inoculum of e. coli and staphylococcus aureus was incubated separately from ag-wd by a filter and quantitated after 18 hours of incubation. inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (icp) determined the silver concentration of mueller-hinton broth containing ag-wd after 24 hours of incubation. to establish if the rate of bacterial killing by ag-wd differed from  a constant silver concentration, pathogens were exposed to a silver concentration of 6.45 microg/ml and quantitated after 18 hours. results: direct exposure to ag-wd significantly reduced bacterial numbers after 15 minutes for k. pneumoniae, 30 minutes for e. coli, 1 hour for p. aeruginosa, and 2 hours for s. equi subspecies zooepidemicus and staphylococcus aureus. indirect exposure to ag-wd resulted in > or =99.9% and > or =90% kill of the inoculum doses of e. coli at 2  hours and staphylococcus aureus at 18 hours, respectively. incubation of the pathogens at the constant silver concentration resulted in bacterial killing rates similar to those obtained by incubation with ag-wd. conclusions: in vitro,  equine pathogens are effectively killed when exposed to ag-wd, and the rate of bacterial killing by ag-wd is similar to a constant silver concentration of 6.45  microg/ml. clinical relevance: the in vitro antimicrobial properties of this silver-coated nylon wound dressing are promising for future prevention of equine  wound infections.

TI  == bacterial meningitis in the newborn: a prospective study of mortality and morbidity.
AB  == neonatal bacterial meningitis is a serious disease around the world, with the incidence changing little in the past 30 years. group b streptococci, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae are common causative organisms and lumbar puncture remains the definitive method of diagnosis. the mortality rate has declined in industrialized countries over the years, from almost 50% in the 1970s to less than 10% in 1997. however, neurological sequelae are still frequently observed despite major changes in treatment. preliminary analysis of our own data from a prospective study of cases in the united kingdom suggests that treatment with third generation cephalosporins is related to a decrease in mortality but not morbidity.

TI  == susceptibility to levofloxacin of clinical isolates of bacteria from intensive care and haematology/oncology patients in switzerland: a multicentre study.
AB  == the objective of this study was to examine the susceptibility of clinical isolates to levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone with extended activity against gram-positive bacteria, and other antibiotics in 12 swiss clinical microbiology laboratories using the nccls disc diffusion technique. isolates were prospectively collected from intensive care units (icus (59%), oncology wards (7%) and other units with haematology/oncology patients (34%) from june 1995 to march 1996. the levofloxacin breakpoints used were as recommended by the manufacturer. a total of 310 gram-positive and 580 gram-negative isolates from the respiratory tract (36%), skin/wounds (12%), blood (16%), urine (17%) and other sources (19%) were tested. the percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin was 100% for enterococcus spp. (38 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (13), streptococcus pneumoniae (65), acinetobacter spp. (11), citrobacter diversus (6), citrobacter freundii (17), klebsiella oxytoca (39), morganella morganii (16), proteus mirabilis (20), proteus vulgaris (23), serratia spp. (19), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (10) and haemophilus influenzae (41). the percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin for staphylococcus aureus (95  strains, including 2% mrsa) was 94%, coagulase-negative staphylococci (85) 65%, enterobacter spp. (75) 99%, escherichia coli (111) 97%, klebsiella pneumoniae (45) 98% and pseudomonas aeruginosa (124) 87%. in conclusion, levofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone to which the most common clinical isolates in switzerland are susceptible. the susceptibility of enterococcus spp. and s. pneumoniae to levofloxacin was particularly remarkable. this compound appears to be a promising therapeutic alternative for the treatment of gram-positive infections.

TI  == [survey of the sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  == research groups were formed in 21 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance. the activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems, were tested against clinical isolates collected from these institutions. the broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,241 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at all institutions between october and  december 1996. the results were as follows: carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against mssa and streptococcus pneumoniae and showed low activities against mrsa. their activities against enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of ampicillin and piperacillin. the carbapenems showed high activities against haemophilis influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae. enterobacter cloacae. serratia marcescens and bacteroides fragilis group. their activities were greater than that exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains of serratia marcescens were detected. the antibacterial activity of carbapenems against pseudomonas aeruginosa was comparable to that of caz, and there were some resistant strains.

AB  == objective: to examine immunological parameters that might explain disease discordance in monozygotic twin pairs with ankylosing spondylitis (as). methods:  11 monozygotic twin pairs (nine with as, two with undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy) were investigated. the peripheral t cell receptor vbeta repertoire was investigated using facs analysis and 14 different vbeta antibodies. in addition serum samples were tested for antibodies to klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, candida albicans, proteus mirabilis, and escherichia coli. peripheral blood lymphocyte reactivity against a number of bacteria was investigated by interferon gamma elispot assays. results: twins suffering from as showed cellular hyporeactivity against k pneumoniae, s pyogenes, c albicans in the elispot assays compared with healthy twins. in contrast with the antibody data, where no significant differences were observed between the two groups, as concordant twins showed the most pronounced differences in their vbeta repertoire on cd4+ and cd8+ lymphocytes. conclusions:  cellular hyporeactivity of peripheral blood cells to bacterial antigens might reflect defective t cell responses allowing bacterial antigens to persist in diseased patients. there are probably other environmental factors that influence  disease concordance.

TI  == bacteraemia in febrile children presenting to a pae3iatric emergency department.
AB  == objective: to determine the prevalence of bacteraemia in young febrile children presenting to a paediatric emergency department. design: prospective observational case study. setting: emergency department of the royal children's hospital, melbourne, between may 1996 and may 1997. participants: patients aged 3-36 months presenting to the emergency department with temperature > or = 39 degrees c and without specific viral illnesses (varicella, croup or herpes gingivostomatitis). outcome measures: bacteraemia (defined as presence of pathogenic bacteria in a blood culture), white blood cell count (wcc), mccarthy score, and final diagnosis based on clinical features and investigations. results: bacteraemia was identified in 18 of 534 patients (3.4%). pathogens isolated were streptococcus pneumoniae (15), neisseria meningitidis (2) and klebsiella pneumoniae (1). increased wcc counts (p < 0.001) and brief duration of fever (p < 0.001) were associated with bacteraemia. nevertheless, clinical features, including mccarthy scores, and high wcc counts (> or = 20 x 10(9)/l) had < 10% predictive accuracy for bacteraemia. overall, final diagnoses in the 534 febrile children included non-specific viral infections (25%), upper respiratory tract infections (24%), otitis media (10%), gastroenteritis (9%), pneumonia (7%), and urinary tract infection (5%). conclusions: most urban australian children aged 3-36 months presenting to a paediatric emergency department with temperature > or = 39 degrees c without a clinical focus have a viral infection. however, 3%-4% have occult bacteraemia. neither clinical features nor high wcc counts reliably identify these patients. as empiric antibiotics may contribute to increasing antibiotic resistance and have not been  shown to prevent the rare complication of meningitis, we believe that close contact and regular review of these patients is preferable to empiric antibiotic  therapy.

TI  == antibacterial activity of simple coumarins: structural requirements for biological activity.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of a series of simple coumarins was evaluated against  8 microorganisms, including three gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococcus and streptococcus pneumoniae) and five gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and haemophilus influenzae), using the microdilution broth method. the coumarins tested showed broad diversity regarding growth inhibitory activity with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.9 to > 12.4 microm. this study, presenting the first systematic analysis of structure-activity relationships among this group of coumarins, revealed some interesting structural requirements. while coumarins with a methoxy function at c-7 and, if present, an oh group at either the c-6 or c-8 position are invariably effective against the spectrum of tested standard bacteria (gram-negative microorganisms including the gram-positive bacterium staphylococcus aureus), the  presence of an aromatic dimethoxy arrangement is apparently favourable against those microorganisms which require special growth factors (beta-hemolytic streptococcus, streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae). a combination of these structural features, two methoxy functions and at least one  additional phenolic group as reflected by the highly oxygenated coumarins, identify promising candidates with antibacterial broad-spectrum activity.

TI  == bloodstream infections in a neonatal intensive-care unit: 12 years' experience with an antibiotic control program.
AB  == objective: to assess the prevalence of gram-positive coccal (gpc), gram-negative  bacillary (gnb), and fungal blood-stream infections (bsis) during a 12-year period in which a consistent antibiotic treatment protocol was in place; to evaluate the efficacy of these antibiotic policies in relation to treatment, to the emergence of bacterial or fungal resistance, and to the occurrence of infection outbreaks or epidemics. study design: case series. methods: demographic, clinical, and bacteriological information from 363 infants born during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997 who developed 433 blood-culture-proven bsis was analyzed. early-onset bsis were defined as those infections discovered within 48 hours of birth, and late-onset bsis as those that occurred thereafter. suspected early-onset bsis were treated with ampicillin and  gentamicin, and suspected late-onset bsis with vancomycin and gentamicin. antibiotics were changed on the basis of organism antimicrobial susceptibility. results: early-onset bsis were noted in 52 of 21,336 live births and 40 of 20,402 live births during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997, respectively. gpc (83% due to group b streptococcus [gbs]) accounted for approximately one half of  early-onset bsi cases and gnb (68% enterobacteriaceae) for the remainder. early-onset gbs declined from 24 to 11 cases (p=.04) and late-onset bsi increased from 111 to 230 cases (p<.01) from the first to the last study period. sixty-eight percent of late-onset bsis were due to gpc (primarily coagulase-negative staphylococcus), 18% to gnb, and 14% to fungus. over the study period, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from the newborn intensivecare unit (unlike those strains from other hospital units) remained fully susceptible to ceftazidime and  gentamicin. although the hospitalwide prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus increased, all 17 newborn bsi cases were due to methicillin-sensitive strains. prevalence of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus increased, although all strains remained vancomycin-susceptible, as did the 16 enterococcus faecalis isolates. all fungi recovered (from 48 patients) were susceptible to amphotericin. conclusion: we observed a decrease in the prevalence of early-onset bsis due to gbs and an increase in late-onset bsis due to gpc, gnb, and fungi. the combination of ampicillin and gentamicin for suspected early-onset bsis and vancomycin and gentamicin for late-onset bsis has been successful for treatment of individual patients without the occurrence of infection outbreaks or the emergence of resistance. controlled antibiotic programs and periodic evaluations based on individual unit and not on hospitalwide antibiograms are advisable.

TI  == bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents: an overview from korea.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance of bacteria has become a worldwide problem. available data suggest that the resistance problem is comparatively more serious in korea.  in large hospitals, the proportion of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) has been reported at over 70%, and of penicillin-nonsusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae at around 70%. infection or colonization of vancomycin-resistant enterococci has started to increase. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae has become widespread and even carbapenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa has been increasing. community-acquired pathogens such as salmonella, shigella and neisseria gonorrhoeae are often resistant to various antimicrobial agents. the prevalence of resistant bacteria can lead to erroneous empirical selection of either noneffective or expensive drugs, prolonging hospitalization and higher mortality. the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria are unavoidable unless  antimicrobial agents are not used at all. the high prevalence of resistant bacteria in korea seems to be related to antibiotic usage: 1) easy availability without prescription at drug stores, 2) injudicious use in hospitals, and 3) uncontrolled use in agriculture, animal husbandry, and fisheries. nosocomial infection is an important factor in the spread of resistant bacteria. antimicrobial resistance problems should be regarded as the major public health concern in korea. it is urgently required to ban the sale of antibiotics without  prescription, to use antibiotics more judiciously in hospitals by intensive teaching of the principles of the use of antibiotics, and to establish better control measures of nosocomial infections. regulation of antimicrobials for other than human use should also be required. these issues are not easy to address and  require the collective action of governments, the pharmaceutical industry, health care providers, and consumers.

AB  == the results of the bacteriological investigation of the secretion from the trachea, large bronchi and fauces of 36 newborns (including 27 preterms) with severe pneumonia were analyzed. 20 of them were born of women with complicating somatic, obstetric and gynecologic histories: candidiasis, herpes genitalis, chronic endometritis, adnexitis or chronic pyelonephritis that could be the risk  of the fetus intranatal infection. during the acute period of pneumonia in the newborns within the first 4-8 days of life mainly pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated (51.3 per cent), staphylococcus epidermidis, s. haemolyticus and enterococcus faecalis were less frequent (18.9, 8.1 and 5.4 per cent, respectively). klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus anhaemolyticus and other organisms were extremely rare. on the whole the gramnegative microflora predominated. the study of the antibiotic susceptibility showed that the majority of the p. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to amikacin and polymyxin b, the isolates susceptible to ceftazidime were less frequent, 20-25 per cent of the isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone and imipenem and practically no isolates were susceptible to gentamicin. the s.epidermidis isolates were susceptible to rifampicin and vancomycin and in rare cases to fusidin and amikacin and resistant to oxacillin. when the treatment course was more than 15 days, the isolates proved to be susceptible to 1/3 of the presently  available antibiotics. because of the host low protective forces, peculiarities of the infection pathways and high frequency of the resistant strains it is valid to include netilmicin, imipenem, cefoperazone and ceftriaxone to the complex therapy of the newborns along with the substitution immunotherapy.

AB  == the aim of this study was to report the clinical and laboratory characteristics of bacterial pneumonia related to measles infection, and also to assess any correlation between severity and time of onset. four hundred and twenty-four previously healthy young males (age 22+/-2.1 yrs) were hospitalized with typical  symptoms and signs of measles. one hundred and twelve (26%) developed bacterial pneumonia on admission (n=41), during their hospital stay (n=20) or days after their discharge (n=51): groups a, b and c, respectively. single lobar consolidation was the most common finding, accounting for 89% of cases. pleural effusion was uncommon and associated in half of the cases with empyema. a microbiological diagnosis was made in 81 cases. streptococcus pneumoniae (65 cases) and klebsiella pneumoniae (9 cases) were the most commonly identified organisms. patients from group c had significantly higher values of white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and lower values of arterial oxygen tension (14+/-0.8 x 10(9) x l(-1), 88+/-4 mm and 6.3+/-0.4 kpa (47+/-3 mmhg), respectively) than the other two groups. there were no deaths during the hospitalization period. the mean duration of hospital stay was 13+/-2.4 days and  was longer in the presence of k. pneumoniae infection (19+/-1.6 days). six patients from group c were admitted to the intensive care unit. in conclusion, these data suggest that bacterial pneumonia associated with measles is not unusual in hospitalized adults, and it seems to be more severe when it occurs days after the onset of rash.

TI  == the biological activity of selected cyclic dipeptides.
AB  == cyclic dipeptides are widely used as models for larger peptides because of their  simplicity and limited conformational freedom. some cyclic dipeptides have been shown to be antiviral, antibiotic and anti-tumour. the aim of this study was to determine the biological activity of four cyclic dipeptides synthesized in this laboratory: cyclo(l-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl), cyclo(l-tyrosyl-l-prolyl), cyclo(l-tryptophanyl-l-prolyl) and cyclo(l-tryptophanyl-l-tryptophanyl). the enhancement or inhibition of calcium channels in ventricular myocytes from rats and delayed-rectifier potassium channels in ventricular myocytes from guinea-pigs were determined by use of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. the induction of  differentiation in ht-29 cells was assessed by assaying for an increase in the expression of alkaline phosphatase. antibiotic properties against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilus and streptococcus sp. were determined by use of the kirby-bauer disc-diffusion assay. results from these assays indicate that the cyclic dipeptides have biological activity in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. three of  the dipeptides block cation channels in ventricular myocytes and all increase the expression of alkaline phosphatase. all the dipeptides have concentration-dependent antibacterial properties. these results suggest that with increased solubility the cyclic dipeptides might have potential as muscle relaxants, anti-tumour compounds and antibiotics.

AB  == a series of novel aminomethyl tetrahydrofuranyl (thf)-1 beta-methylcarbapenems which have excellent broad-spectrum antibacterial activities exhibit modest efficacies against acute lethal infections (3.8 mg/kg of body weight against escherichia coli and 0.9 mg/kg against staphylococcus aureus) in mice when they are administered orally. in an effort to improve the efficacies of orally administered drugs through enhanced absorption by making use of a peptide-mediated transport system, several different amino acids were added at the aminomethyl thf side chains of the carbapenem molecules. the resulting peptidic prodrugs with l-amino acids demonstrated improved efficacy after oral administration, while the d forms were less active than the parent molecules. after oral administration increased (3 to 10 times) efficacy was exhibited with the alanine-, valine-, isoleucine-, and phenylalanine-substituted prodrugs against acute lethal infections in mice. median effective doses (ed50s) of < 1 mg/kg against infections caused by s. aureus, e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, or penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae were obtained after the administration of single oral doses. several of the peptidic prodrugs were efficacious against morganella morganii, serratia marcescens, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae, and e. coli infections, with ed50s of 1 to 14 mg/kg by oral administration compared with ed50s of 14 to > 32 mg/kg for the parent molecules. in general, the parent molecules demonstrated greater efficacy than the prodrugs against these same infections when the drugs were administered by the subcutaneous route. the parent molecule was detectable in the sera of mice after oral administration of the peptidic prodrugs.

TI  == comparative in-vitro activities of trovafloxacin, ciproflaxacin, ofloxacin, and broad-spectrum beta-lactams against aerobe blood culture isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of trovafloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared with  that of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, fleroxacin, ceftazidime, piperacillin/tazobactam, and meropenem against 613 consecutively recovered blood  isolates from recently hospitalized patients. susceptibility testing was performed by agar dilution according to nccls guidelines. test strains included acinetobacter species (n = 26), escherichia coli (n = 137), enterobacter species  (n = 27), klebsiella species (n = 42), proteus species (n = 16), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 28), serratia marcescens (n = 13), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 7), enterococci (n = 54), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 38), staphylococcus aureus (n = 137), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 27), beta-haemolytic streptococci (n = 13), and viridans group streptococci (n = 48).  the overall respective mics at which 50% and 90% of isolates were inhibited (mic50s and mic90s) were as follows: trovafloxacin, 0.06 and 1 mg/l; ciprofloxacin, 0.25 and 4 mg/l; ofloxacin, 0.5 and 4 mg/l; fleroxacin, 0.5 and 16 mg/l; ceftazidime, 2 and 128 mg/l; piperacillin/tazobactam, 2 and 8 mg/l; meropenem, 0.06 and 4 mg/l. for the quinolones, the rank order of activity against gram-negative microorganisms was ciprofloxacin > trovafloxacin > ofloxacin = fleroxacin, against gram-positive organisms, trovafloxacin > ciprofloxacin = ofloxacin > fleroxacin. data obtained showed the similar activity of trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin against gram-negative pathogens and the superior activity of trovafloxacin against gram-positive bacteria thus making it  a potential candidate for the empiric treatment of patients with suspected bacteremia and sepsis.

TI  == spontaneous gastroduodenal perforation in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.
AB  == background/aims: spontaneous gastroduodenal perforation is a rare and lethal complication in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. methodology: data of 9 patients with spontaneous gastroduodenal perforation occurring during chemotherapy were reviewed. results: all 9 patients were male with an average age of 54.4+/-2.5 years. the primary malignancies included 5 head and neck cancers, 2 esophageal cancers, 1 malignant lymphoma, and 1 hepatocellular carcinoma. abdominal pain was the most common symptom. the average interval between the onset of symptoms and surgery was 2.9+/-0.7 days (range: 16 hours to 7 days). perforation was located on the duodenum (6 patients) and on the lower part of the body of the stomach (3 patients). simple closure of the perforation was performed on 8 patients, and subtotal gastrectomy on 1 patient. culture of the ascitic fluid of 8 patients revealed e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus viridans, and enterococcus. four patients (44.4%) had post-operative complications. the 30-day post-operative mortality was 44.4% (4/9). three patients died of sepsis with multiple organ failure, and 1 died of hepatic failure. age, anaemia, leukopenia, serum albumin levels, impaired renal or liver  functions are not significant operative risk factors. pre-operative shock is a significant factor in predicting operative mortality and complications. conclusions: high index with suspicion of the disease with early treatment may improve survival of cancer patients with spontaneous gastroduodenal perforation.

TI  == in vitro activity of meropenem against common pathogenic bacteria isolated in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in taiwan. meropenem was active against most gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis. for many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. it is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. it is uncommon for these common bacteria, except mrsa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to  other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.

TI  == a distinctive cutaneous reaction pattern indicative of infection by reactive arthropathy-associated microbial pathogens: the superantigen id reaction.
AB  == the two major cutaneous expressions of infective states are infections of the skin by viable organisms and immunological responses to nonviable microbial antigens or, in the case of molecular mimickry, their human analogues. these immunological responses are designated as cutaneous id reactions, and manifest a  histomorphology similar to that seen at the primary infective site. this study presents the clinical and histological findings in 16 patients who developed skin eruptions associated with extracutaneous or systemic infections. there was a striking female predominance; patients ranged in age from 10 to 78 years. the majority of cases manifested skin lesions which clinically resembled sweet's syndrome, erythema multiforme and/or erythema nodosum. fever, arthralgia, oligoarthritis, mucosal ulcers of the mouth and/ or genital tract and uveitis were additional features in some cases. isolated clinical presentations included  a petechial rash in a stocking and glove distribution, papular dermatitis, a morbilliform eruption and annular erythema. among the medical and family histories were atopy and stigmata associated with connective tissue disease (ctd). two patients were ingesting drugs with known immune dysregulating properties. skin biopsies showed focal lymphocytic interface dermatitis, a diffuse interstitial histiocytic infiltrate, and a mononuclear cell predominant vascular reaction which in some cases represented vasculitis by virtue of manifesting concomitant luminal or mural fibrin deposition. eosinophils, eczematous alterations, and papillary dermal edema were identified in a minority  of cases. all patients had evidence of a prior or concurrent infection, based on  either positive igm serology for specific microbes or cultures. among the implicated pathogens were cytomegalovirus, parvovirus b19, streptococcus, mycoplasma, klebsiella, and borrelia burgdorferi. all of these organisms are among those associated with reactive arthritis, a phenomenon that was seen in some cases. the histology suggested florid cell mediated immunity (cmi), which the authors attributed to the superantigen properties held by the aforesaid pathogens. skin lesions and constitutional symptoms resolved quickly with antimicrobial therapy in 7 of 9 cases causally linked to bacteria. spontaneous resolution occurred in 5 of 6 virally mediated eruptions. the other 4 patients were given topical steroids or prednisone; these included 1 patient with borrelia burgdorferi infection and 1 patient with radiographic evidence of pneumonia who was never cultured, 1 patient with parvovirus b19 infection, and 1 patient with pneumococcal pneumonia and concomitant sarcoidosis. it is the authors' belief that the eruptions seen in these patients may in part reflect a genetic or iatrogenic predisposition to respond excessively to certain infectious triggers.

TI  == community-acquired septicaemia in southern viet nam: the importance of multidrug-resistant salmonella typhi.
AB  == in a prospective study conducted between mid 1993 and 1994, 437 adults and children were admitted with community-acquired septicaemia to an infectious diseases hospital in southern viet nam. gram-negative aerobes accounted for 90% of isolates and were predominantly salmonella typhi (67%), sal. para-typhi a (3%), escherichia coli (10%), and klebsiella spp. (5%). other salmonella spp. (1%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1%), neisseria meningitidis (0.5%) and haemophilus  influenzae (0.2%) were uncommon. staphylococcus aureus (5.5%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (2%) were the most common gram-positive isolates. patients with enteric fever were younger (median age 16 years, range 1-63) than the other patients (median age 43 years, range 1-88) (p < 0.001) and had a lower mortality  rate (0.3% vs. 23%; relative risk 69.5, 95% confidence interval 9.5-507.8; p < 0.0001). over 70% of the sal. typhi isolated were multi-drug-resistant, and 4% were resistant to nalidixic acid. multidrug-resistant sal. typhi is a major cause of community-acquired septicaemia in viet nam.

TI  == the benefit of appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment in patients with bloodstream infection.
AB  == objectives: to test whether empirical antibiotic treatment that matches the in vitro susceptibility of the pathogen (appropriate treatment) improves survival in patients with bloodstream infections; and to measure the improvement. design: observational, prospective cohort study. setting: university hospital in israel.  subjects: all patients with bloodstream infections detected during 1988-94. interventions: none. main outcome measures: in-hospital fatality rate and length  of hospitalization. results: out of 2158 patients given appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment, 436 (20%) died, compared with 432 of 1255 patients (34%) given inappropriate treatment (p = 0.0001). the median durations of hospital stay for patients who survived were 9 days for patients given appropriate treatment and 11 days for patients given inappropriate treatment. for patients who died, the median durations were 5 and 4 days, respectively (p < 0.05), for both comparisons. in a stratified analysis, fatality was higher in patients given inappropriate treatment than in those given appropriate treatment in all strata but two: patients with infections caused by streptococci other than streptococcus gr. a and streptoccocus pneumoniae (odds ratio (or) of 1.0, 95% confidence interval (95% ci) 0.4-2.5); and hypothermic patients (or = 0.9, 95% ci = 0.3-2.4). even in patients with septic shock, inappropriate empirical treatment was associated with higher fatality rate (or = 1.6, 95% ci = 1.0-2.7). the highest benefit associated with appropriate treatment was observed in paediatric  patients (or = 5.1, 95% ci = 2.4-10.7); intra-abdominal infections (or = 3.8, 95% ci = 2.0-7.1); infections of the skin and soft tissues (or = 3.1, 95% ci = 1.8-5.6); and infections caused by klebsiella pneumoniae (or = 3.0, 95% ci = 1.7-5.1) and s. pneumoniae (or = 2.6, 95% c = 1.1-5.9). on a multivariable logistic regression analysis, the contribution of inappropriate empirical treatment to fatality was independent of other risk factors (multivariable adjusted or = 1.6, 95% ci = 1.3-1.9). conclusion: appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment was associated with a significant reduction in fatality in patients with bloodstream infection.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones and other antibiotics on 1,116 clinical gram-positive and gram-negative isolates.
AB  == a total of 1,116 clinically isolated strains belonging to staphylococcus aureus (200), staphylococcus epidermidis (200), streptococcus pneumoniae (20), escherchia coli (200), klebsiella spp. (177), serratia marcescens (22), pseudomonas aeruginosa (224), haemophilus influenzae (35) and salmonella (38) from the department of infectious diseases, la sapienza university in rome (italy) were tested against three fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and  levofloxacin) and 10 other antibiotics (augmentin, ampicillin, cefaclor, cefixime, cefotaxime, cotrimoxazole, gentamicin, minocycline, oxacillin and vancomycin). fluoroquinolones inhibited essentially about 100% of h. influenzae,  salmonella and s. pneumoniae, more than 75% of staphylococcus including methicillin-resistant strains, and about 90% of enterobacteriaceae and 50% of p.  aeruginosa. minimal inhibitory concentration values ranged from < 0.015 to > 32 micrograms/ml for klebsiella, s. aureus and epidermidis, e. coli and p. aeruginosa; from < 0.015 to 2 micrograms/ml for salmonella; from 0.03 to 16 micrograms/ml for serratia; from < 0.015 to 1 microgram/ml for haemophilus; and from 0.5 to 2 micrograms/ml for s. pneumoniae. levofloxacin and to a lesser extent ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, generally exhibited a greater activity than the other agents against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. regarding the distribution of resistant strains in italy, we found a peculiar pattern of resistance as far as e. coli and p. aeruginosa were concerned. quality control parameters are also summarized. s. epidermidis resulted as a new emergent pathogen especially in immunocompromised patients and its level of sensitivity has been modified over the last few years. in fact, the percentage of resistant strains to antibiotics or the percentage of methicillin-resistant isolates (in our study 35%), has gradually increased. levofloxacin and ofloxacin showed good activity against staphylococcal strains compared with the majority of other antibiotics. these results suggest that the newer quinolones are promising antimicrobial agents for various infections.

TI  == tuberculosis is the commonest cause of pneumonia requiring hospitalization during hajj (pilgrimage to makkah).
AB  == the diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia in mass gathering situations is a medical challenge, requiring prompt decision making and knowledge of the aetiology. we studied cases of pneumonia admitted to two hospitals during the 1994 pilgrimage (hajj) season to makkah. sixty-four patients were enrolled in the study, of which 47 (75%) were men with a mean age of 63 years (range 21-91). nearly all were from developing countries. diagnosis was established in 46 patients (72%) with mycobacterium tuberculosis being the commonest causative organism (20%), followed by gram-negative bacilli (18.8%). streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for only 10%, with legionella pneumophilia, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and viruses accounting each for 6%. the main finding of this study is that m. tuberculosis is a common cause of pneumonia under these unusual "extreme  circumstances". its presentation was acute and indistinguishable from pyogenic pneumonia. thirty-one per cent of tuberculous cases had upper lobe involvement, 54% lower lobe, and 15% multi-lobar. this was similar to the radiographic features in non-tuberculous pneumonia cases. all but one patient with tuberculosis recovered following the administration of first-line anti-tuberculous drugs. the total mortality was 17%. the preponderance of m. tuberculosis and gram-negative bacteria over s. pneumoniae may reflect the prior  use of amoxycillin and the effect of exhaustion, malnutrition, and old age.

TI  == sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

TI  == bacteraemia in the adult intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in nottingham, uk, 1985-1996.
AB  == bacteraemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit. in this study the distribution of organisms causing bacteraemic episodes in patients in the adult intensive care unit of a large teaching hospital was determined. particular emphasis was placed on the type of organisms  isolated from community- and hospital-acquired bacteraemia, the suspected source  of infection, the possible risk factors associated with bacteraemia, and outcome. the incidence of bacteraemia and fungaemia increased from 17.7 per 1000 admissions in 1985 to 80.3 in 1996. a total of 315 episodes of bacteraemia and fungaemia were documented over a 12-year period, of which 18% were considered community-acquired and 82% hospital-acquired. gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 46.9% and 31.5% of the episodes, respectively. polymicrobial infection accounted for 17.8% and fungi for 3.8% of the episodes. staphylococcus aureus (22.5%), staphylococcus epidermidis (7.6%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (7.9%) were the predominant gram-positive bacteria implicated, whereas escherichia coli (6%), enterobacter cloacae (7%), klebsiella  aerogenes (3.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.1%), and acinetobacter spp. (3.8%) were the predominant gram-negative bacteria isolated. the two most common sources of infection were the respiratory tract (39.7%) and an intravascular line (24.5%), but in 8.9% of episodes the focus of infection remained unknown. bacteraemic patients stayed in the unit for a longer period (12 days) than did non-bacteraemic patients (3 days). the overall mortality related to bacteraemia and candidaemia was 44.4%. surveillance of bacteraemia in the intensive care unit is important in detecting major changes in aetiology, e.g., the increasing incidence of gram-positive bacteraemia, the emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in 1995, and the emergence of enterobacter cloacae. it is of value in determining empirical antimicrobial therapy to treat presumed infection pending a microbiological diagnosis and in directing the development of guidelines for infection prevention, e.g., guidelines for central venous catheter care.

TI  == bacterial pathogens (non-mycobacterium) from sputum culture and antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  == sputum culture of patients at siriraj hospital, bangkok was 49.84% positive for bacterial pathogens in 1994 and 40.95% in 1995. the average incidence of gram-negative rods was 3.11 fold more than the combination of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative cocci. the most common gram-negative rod was pseudomonas aeruginosa, followed by either klebsiella pneumoniae or acinetobacter anitratus depending on year. the most common coccus was staphylococcus aureus. from both years, the number of haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, burkholderia pseudomallei and nocardia spp isolated were 122, 93, 13 and 11 strains respectively. for antimicrobial susceptibility, p. aeruginosa was sensitive to ceftazidime, imipenem, gentamicin, amikacin, netilmicin, ciprofloxacin (range 56-89%). s. aureus (mssa) was sensitive to common used drugs. s. aureus (mrsa) was sensitive to co-trimoxazole, fosfomycin, vancomycin (range 57-100%) and resistant to most drugs.

TI  == aetiology and outcome of severe community-acquired pneumonia in singapore.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the aetiology and outcome of severe community-acquired pneumonia, and to assess whether the existing guidelines for initial antimicrobial therapy are being applied. the records of 57 consecutive nonimmunocompromised patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit (icu) between january 1989 and may 1993 with this diagnosis were reviewed. the microbiological data, chest radiographic changes and outcome were analysed. nine  (16%) of the 57 patients had pulmonary tuberculosis. when these patients were excluded from further analysis, a microbiological diagnosis was made in 41 (72%)  cases. the most commonest pathogens were burkholderia pseudomallei (n=10), klebsiella spp. (n=5) and staphylococcus aureus (n=5), mycoplasma pneumoniae (n=4) and streptococcus pneumoniae (n=2) were less common. this microbiological spectrum was quite different from that in the west, where the incidence of s. pneumoniae was higher. also, when pulmonary tuberculosis was excluded, the mortality (67%) was much higher than that in other series. this was attributed to the high incidence of unrecognized b. pseudomallei infection, which is associated with a very high mortality in the region under study. in addition to applying published guidelines on severe community-acquired pneumonia, the endemicity of certain organisms such as mycobacterium tuberculosis and burkholderia pseudomallei in different geographical regions needs to be considered when choosing initial empirical antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == activity of cefepime compared with other antibiotics against gram-positive bacteria and cefuroxime-resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == background: cefepime is a new, parenteral, fourth-generation antibiotic that is stable in the presence of bush group 1 beta-lactamases. in vitro activity of cefepime, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and imipenem against gram-positive cocci and cefuroxime-resistant gram-negative bacilli was studied. methods: the agar dilution method described by the us national committee for clinical laboratory standards was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics tested. these included cefepime, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and imipenem. the tested clinical isolates included gram-positive cocci (methicillin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci, methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, viridans streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, group d enterococci) and cefuroxime-resistant gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter spp, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, burkholderia cepacia and xanthomonas maltophilia). results:  the activity of cefepime against most gram-negative bacilli other than b cepacia  and x maltophilia is better than that of ceftazidime. however, cefepime is less active against these gram-negative bacilli than ciprofloxacin and imipenem. the activity of cefepime against b cepacia and x maltophilia is less than that of ceftazidime or ciprofloxacin. among gram-positive cocci, cefepime was active against most isolates of methicillin-sensitive staphylococci, s pyogenes, viridans streptococci and s pneumoniae. however, cefepime has poor activity against methicillin-resistant s aureus and enterococci. conclusions: due to its extended spectrum of activity, cefepime has potential use as suitable empiric monotherapy for the treatment of a variety of community- and hospital-acquired infections.

TI  == cocaine and lidocaine with phenylephrine as topical anesthetics: antimicrobial activity against common nasal pathogens.
AB  == topical anesthetics are commonly used in the evaluation of nasal pathology. the anesthetics routinely used, 4% lidocaine with phenylephrine, or 4% cocaine, have  been demonstrated to have varying inhibitory effects on bacterial cultures. the present study examined the antimicrobial activity of these topical anesthetics used in nasal procedures. the pathogens used were branhamella catarrhalis, enterobacter sp., haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. organisms were against two-fold serial dilutions of stock preparations of 4% lidocaine with 0.25% phenylephrine, 0.25% phenylephrine, 0.1% methylparaben, 250 mg/ml ampicillin, and 4% cocaine. the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration for each of the solutions were obtained. the bacteria  studied varied gently in their susceptibility to lidocaine with phenylephrine versus cocaine: cocaine consistently exhibited greater antimicrobial activity than lidocaine. phenylephrine and methylparaben showed slight antimicrobial activity. these topical anesthetics have slight bactericidal activity against nasal pathogens, which can sometimes lead to false-negative results. otolaryngologists should recognize the possible antimicrobial effects of topical  anesthetics when culturing specimens. this is especially important when the specimen will be used for guidance of antimicrobial therapy, as in the case of the critically ill patient who requires aspiration for organism-specific therapy. further studies, specifically in vivo experiments, are needed to determine if use of the drugs produces a significant change in the ability to culture organisms from these sites. this type of study would, however, be difficult to perform, since most patients requiring aspiration are already on high-dose antibiotics that would inhibit the growth of most microorganisms. a modified aspiration technique using a less concentrated topical anesthetic will likely be required to increase the chances of obtaining positive cultures.

TI  == the pattern of micro-organisms and the efficacy of new macrolide in acute lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  == lower respiratory tract infection (lrti) is one of the major health problems in developing countries such as indonesia. according to the national household health survey conducted by the ministry of health in 1992, lrtis still rank fourth as the main cause of death in indonesia. the problem of lrtis could be simply managed as long as the causative organism can be identified and the proper antibiotic known. in some occasions, it is not quite so easy to identify the causative micro-organism, especially in lower tract infections. there are several methods of obtaining specimens from lrtis for cultures. the easiest, most simple  way is to collect expectorated sputum. unfortunately, because of the high rate of contamination by upper respiratory tract flora, this method is not reliable. recognizing the difficulties with routine expectorated sputum cultures, two alternative approaches have been suggested. one approach is to bypass potential expectorated sputum 'contaminants' in the oropharynx by transtracheal aspiration  or transthoracic aspiration. the second approach is to modify the usual technique of processing expectorated sputum by either washing techniques or by quantitative cultures. azithromycin and clarithromycin are chemically related to macrolide erithromycin. both antibiotics retain the traditional macrolide spectrum of activity against gram-positive and atypical pneumonia pathogens, while demonstrating improved activity against gram-negative bacteria. the american thoracic society (ats) recommended the use of macrolide for outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia, without comorbidity and 60 years of age or younger. a total of 34 outpatients with acute lrtis were open-comparative, randomly allocated to treatment with the new macrolide in persahabatan hospital, jakarta,  1996. the purposes of this study were: (i) to identify the causative micro-organisms; and (ii) to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the new macrolide  in these infections. azithromycin 500 mg was given orally once a day for 3 days and was administered 1 h before or 2 h after every meal. clarithromycin 500 mg was given orally every 12 h for 10 days. the diagnosis of the patients were: 16 with pneumonia, 10 with acute bronchitis and 8 with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. in this study of 34 patients, the sputum specimens were washed with n acetylcysteine before culture and we could only detect micro-organisms in one patient. before treatment, we found 47 strains in 33 (97.05%) patients and after  treatment we found five strains. from serological examination, only four (11.76%) atypical bacterial were detected. the most frequently found microorganisms were 23 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae (40.42%), 10 of streptococcus alpha haemolyticus (21.26%), five of streptococcus pneumoniae (10.63%) and five of staphylococcus aureus (10.63%). the atypical bacterial were: two legionella pneumophila, one mycoplasma pneumoniae and one chlamydia pneumoniae. the clinical efficacy of new macrolides were 100% and the bacteriological responses with eradication of 94.12% vs 70.59% of isolates in the azithromycin and clarithromycin groups are shown in table 1. there were no adverse reactions detected in the two treatment groups until the end of the study.

TI  == the role of cytokines in bacterial pneumonia: an inflammatory balancing act.
AB  == bacterial pneumonia is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in both developed and developing countries. while tremendous advances have been made in the treatment of pneumonia using broad-spectrum antibiotic regimens, these approaches have resulted in the recent emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria. to understand better the role of the host immune response to pulmonary bacterial  infections, several in vivo animal models have been developed using different bacterial agents: two acute infection models using klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus pneumoniae and one model of chronic infection using pseudomonas aeruginosa. to summarize, the resolution of pulmonary bacterial infections involves a finely orchestrated balancing act of proinflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines. on initial encounter with deposited bacteria, resident alveolar macrophages become activated and secrete proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, resulting in the eventual generation of a proinflammatory amplification loop between resident or recruited macrophages or polymorphonuclear neutrophils and lymphocytes. as the infection is cleared, a second wave of antiinflammatory cytokines is produced to localize the inflammatory response to within the lung microenvironment and eventually to downmodulate this response. experimental perturbation of the host inflammatory "cycle" can have either beneficial or detrimental effects on bacterial clearance. with this in mind, a cautionary approach needs to be used in proposing immunoadjuvant therapies for pneumonia treatment.

TI  == sparfloxacin vs ofloxacin in the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, comparative study. sparfloxacin multicenter abecb study group.
AB  == study objective: comparison of efficacy and safety of sparfloxacin vs ofloxacin for treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (abecb). design: multicenter, double-blind, randomized study. setting: sixty-eight private offices and outpatient clinics in the united states and canada. patients: seven hundred ninety-eight adults with abecb, as confirmed by the acute onset of new (or worsened from the immediate premorbid state) cough and sputum production. interventions: randomization 1:1 to sparfloxacin, 400 mg on day 1, then 200 mg once daily, or ofloxacin, 400 mg twice daily, with matching comparator placebos,  given concurrently for 10 consecutive days. results: the primary efficacy parameter was overall response in the bacteriologically evaluable population. overall success rates in this population were 85.3% and 89.3% for sparfloxacin and ofloxacin, respectively. the two-sided 95% confidence interval was -9.9, 1.9, indicating that sparfloxacin was statistically equivalent to ofloxacin. the all-treated population analysis was similar to that in the evaluable population.  bacterial eradication rates were similar in both treatment groups for haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, chlamydia pneumoniae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and staphylococcus aureus. the frequency of adverse events overall was comparable in the two treatment groups. the sparfloxacin group had a lower frequency of digestive and nervous system adverse events, but a higher frequency  of photosensitivity reactions than the ofloxacin group. conclusions: once-daily oral treatment with 200 mg sparfloxacin (after initial 400 mg dose) is as effective as twice-daily treatment with 400 mg ofloxacin in patients with abecb.

TI  == bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with bloodstream infection: frequencies of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (united states and canada, 1997).
AB  == the sentry program was established in january 1997 to measure the predominant pathogens and antimicrobial resistance patterns of nosocomial and community-acquired infections over a broad network of sentinel hospitals in the united states (30 sites), canada (8 sites), south america (10 sites), and europe  (24 sites). during the first 6-month study period (january to june 1997), a total of 5,058 bloodstream infections (bsi) were reported by north american sentry participants (4,119 from the united states and 939 from canada). in both the united states and canada, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli were the most common bsi isolates, followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci. klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic streptococci were also among the 10  most frequently reported species in both the united states and canada. although the rank orders of pathogens in the united states and canada were similar, distinct differences were noted in the antimicrobial susceptibilities of several  pathogens. overall, u.s. isolates were considerably more resistant than those from canada. the differences in the proportions of oxacillin-resistant s. aureus  isolates (26.2 versus 2.7% for u.s. and canadian isolates, respectively), vancomycin-resistant enterococcal isolates (17.7 versus 0% for u.s. and canadian  isolates, respectively), and ceftazidime-resistant enterobacter sp. isolates (30.6 versus 6.2% for u.s. and canadian isolates, respectively) dramatically emphasize the relative lack of specific antimicrobial resistance genes (meca, vana, and vanb) in the canadian microbial population. among u.s. isolates, resistance to oxacillin among staphylococci, to vancomycin among enterococci, to  penicillin among pneumococci, and to ceftazidime among enterobacter spp. was observed in both nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens, although in almost  every instance the proportion of resistant strains was higher among nosocomial isolates. antimicrobial resistance continues to increase, and ongoing surveillance of microbial pathogens and resistance profiles is essential on national and international scales.

TI  == urinary excretion and bactericidal activities of a single oral dose of 400 milligrams of fleroxacin versus a single oral dose of 800 milligrams of pefloxacin in healthy volunteers.
AB  == twelve healthy volunteers participated in this randomized crossover study to compare the concentrations and recovery levels of fleroxacin and pefloxacin in urine and to assess their bactericidal activities against 12 strains of urinary pathogens with different susceptibilities over a wide range of mics. the volunteers received a single oral dose of 400 mg of fleroxacin or 800 mg of pefloxacin. the mean cumulative renal excretion of unchanged fleroxacin, n-demethyl-fleroxacin, and n-oxide-fleroxacin accounted for 67, 7, and 6% of the  total dose, respectively. the total urinary recovery of pefloxacin and the active metabolite norfloxacin was 34%. in the time-kill and the urinary bactericidal titer (ubt) studies, only the subjects' urine not supplemented with broth was used. with most tested organisms and both quinolones it took more than 8 h to achieve a reduction in cfu of 99.9% (3 log units). overall, there was a good correlation between ubts and mics for the strains. against escherichia coli atcc  25922 the median ubts were similar for both antibiotics and at least 1:8 for 96 h; against the e. coli strain for which the mic was 0.5 microgram/ml the ubt was  at least 1:4 for 48 h. the ubts of both drugs against klebsiella pneumoniae were  at least 1:16 for 72 h. the ubts for staphylococcus aureus (the mic for which was 16 micrograms/ml) of both antibiotics were low, and in some of the samples, no bactericidal titers were observed. ubts for proteus mirabilis of pefloxacin are significantly higher than those of fleroxacin. for pseudomonas aeruginosa the median ubts were present for the 24-to-48-h interval. the same is true for enterococcus faecalis. against staphylococcus saprophyticus, ubts were present for at least 48 h with both quinolones. overall, a single oral dose of 400 mg of  fleroxacin exhibits ubts comparable to those of 800 mg of pefloxacin. therefore,  it may be expected that half of the dose of fleroxacin gives comparable results in the treatment of urinary tract infections; this should be substantiated in comparative clinical trials.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of sparfloxacin activity and spectrum against 24,940 pathogens isolated in the united states and canada, the final analysis.
AB  == sparfloxacin, a recently marketed oral fluoroquinolone, was tested against 24,940 recent clinical strains isolated from blood stream and respiratory tract cultures at 187 hospitals in the usa and canada. sparfloxacin activity was compared with 5 to 13 antimicrobial agents using either etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) and a reference broth microdilution or a standardized disk diffusion method. when applying recommended mic breakpoint criteria of sparfloxacin susceptibility (< or = 0.5 microgram/ml) for streptococcus pneumoniae (4,410 strains) and other streptococcus spp. (554 isolates), 93% and 88% were inhibited, respectively. furthermore, at < or = 1 microgram/ml sparfloxacin susceptibility rates for streptococci increased to 98% overall and 99.3% for s. pneumoniae. in contrast, only 46% and 68% of pneumococci were susceptible to ciprofloxacin (mic90, 3 micrograms/ml; susceptible at < or = 1 microgram/ml) and penicillin (mic90, 1.5 microgram/ml; susceptible at < or = 0.06 microgram/ml), respectively. differences between regions in the usa for rates of penicillin-resistant pneumococcal strains were observed (greatest resistances in southeast and midwest), but results indicate that the sparfloxacin potency was not adversely influenced (mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml). also pneumococcal isolates from the lower respiratory tract were more resistant to penicillin and other beta-lactams. nearly all haemophilus species and moraxella catarrhalis strains, including those harboring beta-lactamases, were susceptible to tested fluoroquinolones (sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and newer oral cephalosporins. sparfloxacin was very active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (mic90, 0.12 microgram/ml; 96-97% susceptible), klebsiella spp. (mic90 0.12 microgram/ml), and other tested enteric bacilli (92-95% susceptible). comparisons between the broth microdilution mic and disk diffusion interpretive results demonstrated excellent intermethod susceptibility category agreement (> 95%) using current sparfloxacin breakpoints, but some compounds (cefpodoxime disk diffusion tests for s. aureus) may require modifications. these results demonstrate that new gram-positive focused fluoroquinolones (sparfloxacin) possess an excellent in vitro activity and spectrum against pathogens that cause  respiratory tract infections. this spectrum of activity includes strains resistant to other antimicrobial classes, including the oral cephalosporins, macrolides, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and earlier fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin). overall, sparfloxacin inhibited 89% to nearly 100% of the isolates (species variable) tested against those species against which it has food and drug administration indications for clinical use.

AB  == in vitro antibacterial activity of the third-generation oral cephem cefteram (cftm)--ten years after its first use in the clinical setting--against recent clinical isolates was evaluated and compared with those of other oral cephems. a  total of 851 clinical isolates belonging to 13 species used in this study were collected from five medical institutions across japan during 1996. cftm showed excellent antibacterial activity against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus and s. pyogenes, equivalent to those of other third-generation oral cephems, except cefixime. of the s. pneumoniae strains, a high proportion, 34.1%, were penicillin-resistant strains (prsp), with mic values of 2.0 micrograms/ml or above, but the mic50 of cftm against prsp was 1.0 microgram/ml. cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems showed potent antibacterial activity against  e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis. a few strains of e. coli, however, were highly resistant to third-generation oral cephems; that might include extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains. mic values against p. vulgaris varied significantly, depending on whether they were determined by the broth micro-dilution method or the agar dilution method; growth was observed at high concentrations in the broth micro-dilution method, in which the skip phenomenon was demonstrated, but not in the agar dilution method. the reason for  this discrepancy is unknown. most strains of s. marcescens, c. freundii, and e. cloacae demonstrated resistance to cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems. cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems showed excellent antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, n. gonorrhoeae, and h. influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains.

TI  == discovery of novel pyridinopolyamines with potent antimicrobial activity: deconvolution of mixtures synthesized by solution-phase combinatorial chemistry.
AB  == a 1638-member pyridinopolyamine library, consisting of 13 sublibraries of 126 members prepared by a solution-phase approach, was completely deconvoluted from orthogonally protected intermediates by a combination of iterative and positional scanning procedures. antibacterial assays against streptococcus pyogenes and escherichia coli imp- and a candida albicans yeast specificity assay were employed to follow the activity of sublibraries. screening of the 13 sublibraries, which were prepared by a synthetic method that places the differentiating functionality in a selected position a (secondary amine), at the  end of the synthesis (fix last), provided several first-round activities. subsequently, six single pyridinopolyamines (2-7) were prepared where the first-round winner, a hydrogen atom, is in the first deconvoluted position and the remaining three positions contained the same functionalities. the range of antibacterial and yeast activities of these single compounds suggested that a more active and selective compound may be discovered by completely deconvoluting  the first-round active sublibraries. pyridinopolyamine positions b (secondary benzylamine) and c (primary benzylamine) were then sequentially positionally scanned with a set of six meta-substituted benzyl functionalities to generate two sets of second/third-round sublibraries, containing 21 or 36 compounds in each sublibrary, respectively. high-throughput screening yielded sublibraries 15, 18,  and 21 with mics of 1-5 microm against s. pyogenes and e. coli imp-. using rounds 1 and 2/3 screening data, two sets of single compounds (22-27) and (28-32) with the combination of m-(trifluoromethyl)-benzyl group at position c and m-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl or m-methylbenzyl group at position b with position d (primary benzylamine) fixed were synthesized in the fourth round deconvolution. subsequently, broader screening of deconvoluted compounds against a tier ii panel of wild-type bacteria identified eight compounds (5, 7, 27, and 29-32) with approximately 100-fold greater selectivity for gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. thus, s. pyogenes, s. pyogenes (wild-type), streptomyces aureus, and enterococcus faecalis were inhibited at mics of 1-12 microm, whereas mics for e.  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were >  100 microm. these eight compounds were not active (> 100 microm) against fungus c. albicans.

TI  == emerging pathogens for pneumonia in singapore.
AB  == the death rate from pneumonia in singapore has increased steadily over the past decade. the emerging respiratory pathogens may have contributed to this increased mortality. new challenges have arisen from changes in the characteristics of the  host and the susceptibilities of the various pathogens to antibiotics. there has  been a 60-fold increase in the incidence of penicillin resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae, the major pathogen for community-acquired pneumonia (cap). gram-negative bacilli are the major pathogens in severe cap with klebsiella pneumonia being the most frequently isolated organism. there has been  a small increase in the number of cases of legionnaire's disease and a marked increase in the incidence of melioidosis. while the overall incidence of tuberculosis has been unchanged, the number of non-residents with tuberculosis has doubled in the past 5 years. the rising prevalence of human immunodeficiency  virus infection is reflected in an increasing number of apparently healthy young  men who present with cap caused by pneumocystis carinii. there is increasing resistance to antibiotics among gram-negative bacilli and staphylococcus aureus,  the dominant pathogens in hospital-acquired pneumonia. new strategies are urgently needed to prevent the emergence of pathogens in the hospital environment which may be resistant to all known antibiotics.

TI  == the infectious complications of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
AB  == infectious complications continue to have a major impact on the clinical course of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia despite advances in therapeutic approaches to this disease and supportive care. although the pathogenesis of infection in these patients is multifactorial, systemic hypogammaglobulinemia is  the major immune defect accounting for the increased risk of infection. despite common knowledge of systemic immune defects in this population, information regarding mucosal immune function is minimal. in patients treated with conventional alkylating agents, infections commonly occur at mucosal sites, especially the respiratory tract, and organisms such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa are frequent isolates. the use of purine analogues as fludarabine has resulted in a change in this spectrum of infection,  with the appearance of opportunistic infections caused by pneumocystis, listeria, mycobacterium tuberculosis, nocardia, candida, aspergillus, and herpesviruses. further knowledge of the impact of chemotherapy on immune function, and of the immune defects in these patients, both inherent to the primary disease process and therapy-related, will aid in the formulation of better prophylactic and therapeutic interventions to reduce the risk of infection and improve the ultimate outcome of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

TI  == bacterial and ureaplasma colonization of the airway: radiologic findings in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  == objective: we designed this retrospective study to compare radiologic findings in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) in whom gram-positive cocci (gpc), gram-negative bacilli (gnb), or ureaplasma urealyticum were colonized. another objective was to correlate the radiologic findings of these patients with the clinical severity of bpd. study design: we correlated serial tracheal aspirates with radiographic findings from 183 infants whose birth weight was < or = 1250 gm. bpd severity was assessed by oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age (36 w pca) and at the time of discharge. two radiologists independently scored films taken at birth and 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days of life. results: of the study population, 55% were male and 35% were black; 80% received surfactant and 69% received dexamethasone; 91% survived. gpc isolates from throat cultures were mainly staphylococcus [corrected] epidermidis and streptococcus haemolyticus. a superimposed gnb colonization was present in 37% of these infants. most common isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and escherichia coli. sepsis caused by gpc developed in 16% of all patients; 7% had sepsis caused by gnb. infants infected with gnb remained receiving oxygen at 36 w pca and at the time of discharge twice as often as those noninfected. radiologic findings: hyperinflation, interstitial changes, and generalized or localized emphysema were prominent features throughout. mean radiologic scores increased over time in a pattern similar among gpc, gnb, and u. urealyticum infected and noninfected infants. high radiologic scores were not predictive at any time of infants who needed supplemental oxygen at 28 days and at 36 w pca. infants infected with u. urealyticum were neither clinically nor radiologically different than noncolonized neonates. conclusion: gpc, gnb, and u. urealyticum airway colonization is not associated with particular radiographic changes at any time. gnb-infected infants had the most severe bpd course, and yet they were radiologically indistinguishable from the other patients. u. urealyticum colonization does not result in more clinically severe bpd or demonstrate a unique radiologic course.

TI  == bacterial growth in human vitreous humor.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the capacity of human vitreous to support bacterial growth and to show differences in the growth kinetics of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. vitreous gel of 70 keratoplasty donor eyes was sampled under sterile conditions, screened microscopically for cellular  components and tested for sterility and levels of antibiotic drugs by bio-assay.  the samples were inoculated with clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus viridans and streptococcus pyogenes. as control each strain was added both to 0.9% sodium chloride solution and to mueller-hinton broth. in order to determine bacterial growth the number of colony forming units was determined 4, 6, 24, 48 and 72 hr after inoculation by viable count. vitreous gel did not support bacterial growth; the tested strains could not be recovered after 48 hr.  similar results could be obtained with sodium chloride; whereas in mueller hinton broth the strains showed normal pattern of growth. it seems that vitreous humor has inherent antibacterial capacity in vitro, although the responsible factors remain unknown.

AB  == in the antimicrobial therapy of denture stomatitis, it is desirable to inhibit the growth of not only the primary causative organism, candida albicans, but also other oral bacteria closely associated with the condition. three synthetic anti-candidal chalcones were characterized and compared for their additional activity in inhibiting these causative bacteria. among the tested chalcones, 2,4,2'-trihydroxy-5'-methylchalcone showed the highest activity for different gram-positive bacteria. it inhibited the growth of streptococci, staphylococci and lactobacilli at 25.0-50.0 micrograms/ml which was lower than or comparable to its minimum inhibitory concentration for candida. it functioned with a bactericidal action and leaked 260 nm-absorbing substances from the streptococcal cells. the antimicrobial activity of 2,4,2'-trihydroxy-5'-methylchalcone against  both primary and secondary causative agents suggests it could be useful as a potent therapeutic agent in denture stomatitis.

TI  == comparative in vitro assessment of sparfloxacin activity and spectrum using results from over 14,000 pathogens isolated at 190 medical centers in the usa. spar study group.
AB  == sparfloxacin, a new orally administered fluoroquinolone, was tested against 14,182 clinical strains isolated (generally blood stream and respiratory tract cultures) at nearly 200 hospitals in the united states (usa) and canada. sparfloxacin activity was compared with 13 other compounds by etest (ab biodisk,  solna, sweden), broth microdilution, or a standardized disk diffusion method. using the food and drug administration/product package insert mic breakpoint for  sparfloxacin susceptibility (< or = 0.5 microgram/ml), 94% of streptococcus pneumoniae (2666 isolates) and 89% of the other streptococci (554 isolates) were  susceptible. however, at < or = 1 microgram/ml (the breakpoint for all nonstreptococcal species) sparfloxacin susceptibility rates increased to 100% and 98%, respectively, for the two groups of streptococci. only 50% and 65% of pneumococci were susceptible to ciprofloxacin (mic90, 3 micrograms/ml) and penicillin (mic90, 1.5 micrograms/ml), respectively. although there were significant differences between regions in the usa in the frequency of penicillin-resistant pneumococcal strains, results indicate that the overall sparfloxacin mic90 was uniformly at 0.5 microgram/ml. nearly all (> or = 99%) haemophilus species and moraxella catarrhalis, including those harboring beta-lactamases, were susceptible to sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. only cefprozil and macrolides demonstrated lower potency and spectrum against these two species. sparfloxacin was active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (96 to 97%), klebsiella spp. (95%), and other tested enteric bacilli (93%). comparison between broth microdilution mic and disk diffusion interpretive results for m. catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus, and the enterobacteriaceae showed an absolute intermethod categorical agreement of > 95% using current sparfloxacin breakpoints, in contrast to those of cefpodoxime for s. aureus where a conspicuous discord (98% versus 59%) between methods was discovered. these results demonstrate that sparfloxacin possesses sufficient in vitro activity and spectrum versus pathogens that cause respiratory tract infections (indications), especially strains resistant to other drug classes such as the earlier fluoroquinolones, oral cephalosporins, macrolides, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. the sparfloxacin susceptibility breakpoint for streptococci may require modification (< or = 1 microgram/ml) based on the mic population analysis presented here. a modal mic (0.38 to 0.5 microgram/ml) was observed at the current breakpoint. regardless, sparfloxacin inhibited 89% (nonpneumococcal streptococcus spp.) to 100% (haemophilus spp., m. catarrhalis) of the isolates tested with a median activity of 97% against indicated species.

AB  == objective: to study the epidemiology of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in the negev area of southern israel. design: a prospective 8-year study conducted at the neonatal intensive care unit and pediatric wards of the soroka university medical center. results: two hundred twenty-nine cases of hospital and community-acquired neonatal sepsis occurred during the study period. thirty-two patients (14%) were meningitis. during this period 70,709 births (59% jews and 41% bedouins) were recorded; thus the rates of neonatal sepsis and meningitis were 3.2 and 0.5/1000 live births, respectively. one hundred seventeen (4/1000 live births) cases were recorded in bedouins and 112 (2.6/1000 live births) in jewish neonates (p < 0.001). twenty-six percent of all sepsis cases occurred within < 24 h from birth, 25% from days 2 to 7 of life and 49% between days 8 and 28. a total of 251 organisms that were considered true pathogens were isolated. fifty-seven of all isolates were gram-negative organisms (mainly klebsiella pneumoniae (20%) and escherichia coli (16%)). gram-positive organisms were isolated in 41% of cases. although e. coli was the most frequently recovered gram-negative pathogen in community-acquired late onset sepsis, klebsiella and enterobacter spp. represented the most commonly isolated gram-negative organisms  in nosocomial late onset sepsis. all staphylococcus aureus isolates recovered in  late onset sepsis were nosocomial. the incidence of streptococcus agalactiae was  3 times higher in early onset sepsis than in late onset sepsis. all cases of streptococcus pneumoniae sepsis occurred in bedouins. conclusions: neonatal sepsis and meningitis rates in southern israel are similar to those reported in western europe and the united states. the incidence of neonatal sepsis is significantly higher for bedouins than for jewish neonates. the distribution of the main pathogens is different in southern israel and although gram-negative enteric organisms are predominant, s. agalactiae plays a relatively minor role in the etiology of sepsis during the first month of life. in southern israel the etiology of community-acquired late onset sepsis is different from that of nosocomial late onset sepsis.

TI  == development of an antimicrobial susceptibility testing method suitable for performance during space flight.
AB  == very little is known regarding the effects of the microgravity environment of space flight upon the action of antimicrobial agents on bacterial pathogens. this study was undertaken to develop a simple method for conducting antibacterial susceptibility tests during a space shuttle mission. specially prepared susceptibility test research cards (biomerieux vitek, hazelwood, mo.) were designed to include 6 to 11 serial twofold dilutions of 14 antimicrobial agents,  including penicillins, cephalosporins, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, vancomycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. mics of the drugs were determined by visual reading of color end points in the vitek research cards made possible by incorporation of a colorimetric growth indicator (alamarblue; accumed international, westlake, ohio). this study has demonstrated reproducible susceptibility results in the testing of isolates of staphylococcus aureus, group a streptococcus species, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli (beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains), klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in some instances, the mics were comparable to those determined by a standard broth microdilution method, while in some cases the unique test media and format yielded slightly different values that were themselves reproducible. the proposed in-flight experiment will  include inoculation of the vitek cards on the ground prior to launch of the space shuttle, storage of inoculated cards at refrigeration temperature aboard the space shuttle until experiment initiation, and then incubation of the cards for 18 to 48 h prior to visual interpretation of mics by the mission's astronauts. ground-based studies have shown reproducible mics following storage of inoculated cards for 7 days at 4 to 8 degrees c to accommodate the mission's time schedule and the astronaut's activities. for comparison, ground-based control (normal gravity) mic values will be generated by simultaneous inoculation and incubation  of a second set of test cards in a laboratory at the launch site. this procedure  can provide for a safe and compact experiment that should yield new information on the effects of microgravity on the biological activities of various classes of antibiotics.

TI  == [diagnostic imaging and therapeutic implications in lung infections in patients with hiv-1 infection].
AB  == we studied retrospectively 132 episodes of infectious pneumonias in 89 patients examined from 1990 to 1995. pneumocystis carinii was found to be the most common  cause of pneumonia (33 patients). the other causes were: streptococcus pneumoniae (15), mycobacterium tuberculosis (14), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8), staphylococcus aureus (5), cytomegalovirus (4), haemophilus influentiae (4), mycobacterium avium intracellulare (2), klebsiella pneumoniae (2), e. coli (2), serratia marcescens (1). no etiologic agent was found in 40 cases. we stress the need of a more frequent use of invasive diagnostic procedures in the study of focal lung consolidations because this radiologic sign is highly aspecific and may be caused by too many different pathogenic agents, needing different therapies-i.e., streptococcus pneumoniae (15 cases), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8), staphylococcus aureus (5), klebsiella pneumoniae (2), escherichia coli (2), pneumocystis carinii, serratia marcescens and haemophilus influentiae (1). since there is an increase in mortality among patients treated with empiric antibiotic therapy, we  stress the need of the routinary use of bronchoalveolar lavage in hiv+ patients with lung consolidation to perform specific therapy. moreover, pneumocystis carinii is by far the most frequent cause of diffuse interstitial infiltrates, and pcp has very suggestive clinical (dyspnea), radiologic (diffuse perihilar interstitial infiltrates; ground glass opacities; pneumatoceles) and laboratory (cd3+cd4 < 200/mcl; ldh > 600 ui/dl; po2 < 70 mmhg) patterns, always related to the discovery of pneumocystis carinii in escreatum. thus, we decided to treat 15  patients with specific therapy for pneumocystis carinii pneumonia with the above  diagnostic algorithm, obtaining in all of them complete clinical and radiologic recovery. to conclude, in critical patients, invasive procedures should be performed only in the cases in which pcp is clinically improbable.

TI  == [susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1995)].
AB  == the bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected by institutions located throughout japan, since 1981. ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. results obtained from these investigations are discussed. in 23 institutions around the entire japan, 567 strains of presumably  etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 459 patients with lower respiratory tract infections during the period from october 1995 to september 1996. mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 74 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 82 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 104 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 85 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 18 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 52 strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, 25 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the drug susceptibilities of these strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. 1) s. aureus. s. aureus strains for which mics of oxacillin (mpipc) were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) accounted for 52.7%. arbekacin (abk) showed the most highest activity against s. aureus with mic80 of  0.5 micrograms/ml. vancomycin (vcm) showed the next highest activity with mic80 of 1 microgram/ml. these drugs showed the high activities against mrsa with mic80s of 1 microgram/ml. 2) s. pneumoniae. most of drugs tested showed potent activities against s. pneumoniae. imipenem (ipm) and panipenem (papm), carbapenems, showed the most potent activity with mic80s of 0.063 microgram/ml. cefotaxime (ctx), cefmenoxime (cmx) and cefpirome (cpr) of cephems showed the next most potent activities with mic80s of 0.25 microgram/ml. erythromycin (em) and clindamycin (cldm) showed low activities with mic80s 128 micrograms/ml or high. among these strains, however, 48.8% and 65.9% of respective strains were quite toward sensitive these agents with mics of 0.063 microgram/ml. 3) h. influenzae. the activities of all drugs were potent against h. influenzae test with all mics at 4 micrograms/ml or below. cefotiam (ctm), cmx, cefditoren (cdtr) and ofloxacin (oflx) showed the most potent activity with mic90s to 0.063 microgram/ml. 4) p. aeruginosa. (mucoid strains) ipm and tobramycin (tob) showed  the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains) with mic80s of 1  microgram/ml. ceftazidime (caz), cefsulodin (cfs) and carumonam (crmn) showed next potent activity, with mic80s of 2 micrograms/ml. the mic80s of the other drugs ranged from 4 micrograms/ml to 32 micrograms/ml. 5) p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). tob and ciprofloxacin (cpfx) showed the most potent activities against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains) with mic80s of 1 microgram/ml. the mic80 of ampicillin (abpc) was 128 micrograms/ml in 1994, it was 16 micrograms/ml in 1995. 6) k. pneumoniae. all drugs except abpc were active against k. pneumoniae. cpr and crmn showed the most potent activities against k.  pneumoniae with mic80s of 0.063 microgram/ml. the mic80s of the other drugs ranged from 0.125 microgram/ml to 2 micrograms/ml. 7) m. (b.) catarrhalis. against m. (b.) catarrhalis, all the drugs showed good activities with mic80s at  4 micrograms/ml or below. and mics of all strains were 8 micrograms/ml or below.  ipm, oflx and minocycline (mino) showed the most potent activity with mic80s of 0.063 microgram/ml. also, we investigated year to year changes in the characteristics of patients, their respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology. patients' backgrounds were examine for 567 isolates from 459 cases. the examination of age distribution found that the proportion of patients with ages over 60 years was 66.3% of all the patients showing a slight increase over that in 1994. proportion of differe

TI  == single and multiple pyogenic liver abscesses: clinical course, etiology, and results of treatment.
AB  == a total of 483 patients with pyogenic liver abscess during the years 1986 to june 1995 were studied at chang gung memorial hospital in kaohsiung: 343 were a single abscess and 140 were multiple abscesses. males were predominantly affected by this disease. abdominal pain was more frequent with the single abscess than with  multiple abscesses, and jaundice was more frequent with multiple abscesses. blood levels of alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and creatinine and the white blood cell count were significantly higher in patients with multiple abscesses than in  those with a single abscess; and the hemoglobin level was higher with single abscesses. the single abscess was usually larger than 5 cm, and the multiple abscesses were usually smaller than 5 cm. the single abscess was always located on the right side (72%) and the multiple abscesses always on the right or both sides. single abscesses mainly had a cryptogenic origin (58.9%) and multiple abscesses a biliary origin (45.0%). liver aspirates revealed klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, streptococcus, bacteroides, enterococcus, among others. k. pneumoniae was more often found in a single abscess and e. coli more often in multiple abscesses. percutaneous catheter drainage and aspiration comprised the main treatment initially, and the failure rate with multiple abscesses was higher than that with single abscesses. surgical intervention should be considered for multiple abscesses because of the underlying disease. the overall mortality with multiple abscesses (22.1%) was higher than that with a single abscess (12.8%). partial hepatectomy produced a low mortality rate for both single and multiple abscesses and should be considered in the presence of severe hepatic destruction by an abscess or a stone.

TI  == host-pathogen interactions in bacterial endocarditis: streptococcal virulence in  the host.
AB  == to identify streptococcal genes that are expressed during experimental endocarditis, we developed a promoter-less dual reporter gene-fusion (amy, cat) plasmid, pak36. chromosomal dna from s. gordonii v288 was digested with sau3a1. the resulting fragments were ligated into pak36. following transformation into s. gordonii, the library of random gene fusion clones was inoculated into a rabbit to induce experimental endocarditis. chloramphenicol treatment effected positive  selection. upon euthanization of the rabbits, the valvular vegetations were excised in a sterile field. surviving clones were isolated and screened in vitro  for chloramphenicol sensitivity and negative amylase activity. from the 48 randomly picked, double-negative clones, dna was isolated and analyzed by southern hybridization with labeled pak36 probe. different insertion patterns were identified, suggesting that no fewer than 13 s. gordonii genes were induced. therefore, s. gordonii genes are induced during experimental endocarditis, which  may contribute to virulence.

AB  == the kinetics of specific iga mucosal responses was assessed in 12 healthy volunteers over 3 weeks of treatment by oral administration of an immunostimulant, ribomunyl, composed of ribosomes from the four bacteria streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. the levels of iga specific for these four bacteria increased after each immunization and, after the third week of treatment, were significantly higher than baseline day 0 values. this study demonstrates that oral ribosomal immunostimulation results in the production of specific salivary antibodies liable to recognize whole bacteria antigens, and therefore likely to confer protection. the kinetic analysis performed also demonstrates the rapidity  of specific mucosal immune responses after oral stimulation in man, a feature still seldom explored.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance: implications for managing respiratory failure.
AB  == the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in respiratory pathogens is increasing rapidly. in the community, resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics has escalated dramatically among moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, and streptococcus pneumoniae. resistance to penicillin among s. pneumoniae has developed at an alarming rate over the past two decades. recent studies in the united states have cited rates of penicillin resistance as high as 23.6%, with 9.5% exhibiting high-level resistance. many of these strains are resistant to multiple antibiotics. antimicrobial resistance in hospital-acquired pathogens is  a problem, which in large part reflects patterns of antibiotic use. antimicrobial resistance may arise via multiple mechanisms. pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli have become increasingly resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, including imipenem. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases are seen with  increasing frequency in enterobacteriaceae, primarily klebsiella spp. fluoroquinolone resistance has increased in p. aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus and has now been identified in escherichia coli isolated from hematology wards. excessive use of antibiotics may promote the emergence and spread of resistant microorganisms. rigorous infection control measures and modification of antibiotic use patterns may limit or reduce the prevalence of resistant organisms.

TI  == role of coagulase in a murine model of hematogenous pulmonary infection induced by intravenous injection of staphylococcus aureus enmeshed in agar beads.
AB  == we describe a novel mouse model of acute staphylococcal pneumonia induced by intravenous injection of staphylococcus aureus enmeshed in agar beads. for comparison, we also used various strains of bacteria, including three strains of  s. aureus, two strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, one strain of streptococcus pyogenes, three strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one strain of klebsiella pneumoniae. all except two strains of s. aureus were cleared rapidly from the lungs. when s. aureus numr1 enmeshed in agar beads was injected intravenously, the organisms concentrated and remained in the lung for a period longer than several weeks. multiple lung abscesses were evident macroscopically, and histological examination of the infected lung showed multiple lung abscesses around the pulmonary arterioles, consisting of bacterial colonies encircled with  fibrin filaments and surrounded by inflammatory cells of neutrophils and macrophages. when 14 strains of clinically isolated s. aureus were injected intravenously, the number of bacteria recovered from the lung tissue 7 days after infection correlated with the titer of staphylocoagulase (p < 0.01) but not with  the titer of clumping factor. injection of coagulase-deficient mutant strain du5843 was associated with a markedly reduced number of viable bacteria isolated  from the lung, compared with its coagulase-positive parental strain du5789. our results suggest that coagulase may play a role in the development of blood-borne  staphylococcal pneumonia in our model. our animal model is simple and reproducible and resembles blood-borne staphylococcal pneumonia in humans, and it could be useful for investigating the pathogenicity or treatment of staphylococcal pulmonary infection, including infections with methicillin-resistant s. aureus.

AB  == the in vitro activity of cefpirome, a new parenteral fourth-generation cephalosporin, was investigated in the 5 university hospitals of switzerland, and compared to 9 other antibiotics mainly used in hospitals, such as ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, piperacillin, imipenem, gentamicin, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. a total number of 992 strains collected only from intensive care units and haematology-oncology units were tested by microdilution  according to nccls. cefpirome showed an excellent activity against all enterobacteriaceae (mic90 = 4 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic90 = 1 mg/l), streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90 = 0.25 mg/l) and haemophilus influenzae (mic90 = 0.12 mg/l) isolates. its activity was superior to that of third-generation cephalosporins against cephalosporinase-depressed mutants of enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii isolates (mic90 > 32 mg/l for third-generation cephalosporins vs 4 mg/l for cefpirome). the mics of cefpirome of 3 strains of klebsiella spp. with an extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase were lower (mic90 = 2 mg/l) than those of third-generation cephalosporins (mics90 > 32 mg/l). against pseudomonas aeruginosa cefpirome was as active as ceftazidime. the activity of cefpirome was poor against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococci and nosocomial gram-negative bacteria such as stenotrophomonas maltophilia.

TI  == [community-acquired pneumonia: etiological diagnosis].
AB  == microbiological and immunoserological approaches were used in etiological diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. it was concluded that streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, legionella pneumophila and klebsiella pneumoniae predominated in the etiological structure of present severe community-acquired pneumonia. the most actual causative agents of nonsevere community-acquired pneumonia in persons under 60 were s. pneumoniae, hemophilus influenzae, mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydia pneumoniae. nonsevere  community-acquired pneumonia in persons over 60 and/ or at the background of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, diabetes mellitus or other affections was most frequently due to s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae and aerobic gramnegative microbes.

TI  == effectiveness of ribosomal fractions of klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae and the membrane fraction of kp (ribomunyl) in the prevention of clinical recurrences of infectious rhinitis. results of a multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled study.
AB  == a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to investigate the efficacy of an immunostimulant, ribomunyl, in the prevention of recurrences of infectious rhinitis in adults. this trial involved 327 patients (168 ribomunyl treated and 159 placebo cases) with an average of 4.3 +/- 1.8 rhinitis episodes per patient recorded during the year preceding the study. the main criterion of efficacy was the cumulative number of recurrences of infectious rhinitis during a 6-month follow-up period, as analyzed by standard tests. an additional analysis of relative risk of recurrences used multivariate failure for time data. ribomunyl was effective throughout the study period, starting from the first month of treatment: a mean of 1.0 +/- 1.1 recurrences was recorded in the ribomunyl group as compared to 1.5 +/- 1.4 recurrences in the placebo group; this indicated one-third fewer infections (p = 0.001). the protective effect of ribomunyl on the relative risk for recurrences was estimated to be 0.58 by multivariate analysis (95% ci: 0.43-0.78, p = 0.0001). analysis of secondary criteria also favored ribomunyl: 38.5% less antibiotic courses per patient (0.8 +/- 1.3 vs 1.3 +/- 1.6; p = 0.002) and the number of days with antibiotics (5.6 +/- 9.3 vs 9.1 +/- 12.1; p = 0.002).

TI  == community-acquired bacteremia in human immunodeficiency virus-infected children in harare, zimbabwe.
AB  == background: hiv infection is common in mothers and their children in zimbabwe, and hiv-infected children are particularly susceptible to bacterial infections. there is little information on the etiology and outcome of hiv-related bacteremia in african children. methods: blood cultures from 309 hospitalized children in zimbabwe, of whom 168 were diagnosed as having hiv, were examined for pathogens.  the association among significant bacteremia, hiv infection and mortality was assessed in these children. results: the most common isolates were coagulase-negative staphylococci (31 children, 25 clinically significant), staphylococcus aureus (22 children) and streptococcus pneumoniae (20 children). nontyphoidal salmonella (10 children), escherichia coli (4 children) and klebsiella sp. (4 children) were the most frequent gram-negative bacteria. two children had rhodococcus equi pneumonia. hiv-infected children showed increased risk of bacteremia (odds ratio (or) = 2.68), especially if younger than 18 months of age (or = 2.94), and high risk of enterobacteremia (or = 15.76). there was no  significant association of bacteremia with nutritional status. mortality was 17%  overall but was higher in hiv-infected children up to 6 months of age (or = 2.81) and in bacteremic children of any age (or = 2.03). conclusions: prompt recognition of pathogens and early administration of appropriate antimicrobials is important in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with bacteremia in hiv-infected children in africa.

AB  == a persistent suppression of bacterial growth following limited exposure to an antimicrobial agent, the postantibiotic effect (pae), has been described for a variety of antibiotics and microorganisms. in this study the pae of ceftriaxone and gentamicin was determined in vitro on three strains each of klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus viridans. the strains were exposed to the substances for 2 h at varying concentrations. ceftriaxone was used at the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and 1/2 mic and gentamicin at 1/2 mic, 1/4 mic, and 1/8 mic, each alone and in combination. antibiotic concentrations were reduced by 1,000-fold dilution, bacterial regrowth was consequently monitored by viable count. the pae of ceftriaxone alone reached up to 145 min (mic) and 50 min (1/2 mic), that of gentamicin alone up to 170 min (1/2 mic), 135 min (1/4 mic) and 70 min (1/8 mic), depending on the bacterial species. combinations of the antibiotics produced longer paes than one substance  alone; the longest pae was produced by the combination of ceftriaxone (mic) and gentamicin (1/2 mic) lasting up to 320 min (s. viridans). it may be important to  take the pae into account when evaluating dosing intervals.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against clinical isolates].
AB  == in order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefodizime (cdzm), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cdzm and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates collected from nation-wide medical institutions and in  our laboratory from september to december of 1992 and from september to december  of 1995. the results are summarized as follows: 1. bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to cdzm included streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis and neisseria gonorrhoeae. the  range of mic values of cdzm against klebsiella pneumoniae was spread. other strains, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., peptostreptococcus spp.  and bacteroides fragilis group were resistant to cephems including cdzm. 2. the mic90's of cdzm were 0.05 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml against streptococcus  spp., h. influenzae, m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, klebsiella spp., p. mirabilis, n. gonorrhoeae and peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently  found in daily treatment of infections. it appears that the effectiveness of cdzm was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. among h. influenzae isolates included imipenem (ipm)-resistant and norfloxacin (nflx)-resistant strains. the mic-range of cdzm against strains collected in 1995 including ipm-resistant and nflx-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and mic90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. cdzm showed strong antimicrobial activities against h. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.

TI  == a multinational european survey on the in-vitro activity of rufloxacin and other  comparative antibiotics on respiratory and urinary bacterial pathogens.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of rufloxacin was confirmed against a large number of  respiratory and urinary tract pathogens collected in five european countries. in  terms of both mic90 values and percentages of susceptible isolates found, this new quinolone showed useful in-vitro activity against mycoplasma catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae and klebsiella pneumoniae, with a large proportion of staphylococcus aureus also covered, while, as expected streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes were not included in its antibacterial spectrum. rufloxacin was comparable with the other antibiotics against these pathogens with the exception of streptococci. against these microorganisms, beta-lactams were the most active agents. against the urinary pathogens the in-vitro activity of rufloxacin is similar to that of norfloxacin although this latter drug is more active in terms of mic90 values and in percentages of strains inhibited. in many  cases more isolates were susceptible to the remaining comparator agents than to rufloxacin. however, there were no significant differences between the numbers of microorganisms inhibited by the various drugs and rufloxacin. the findings of this survey do not seem to modify the general picture which emerged in previous studies and further confirms its useful spectrum in different geographic settings.

AB  == 3 splenectomized patients infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) are  described. they all presented with more than 500 cd4/mm3 but, surprisingly, with  a cd4 percentage below 15, positive p24 antigenemia and a cd4/cd8 ratio below 0.24. 2 patients had repeated episodes of oropharyngeal candidiasis while their cd4 counts exceeded 800/mm3. these episodes suggested the presence of a certain degree of immuno-suppression and prompted us to introduce anti-hiv therapy. 2 patients also presented with a pulmonary infection, due to klebsiella pneumoniae  and haemophilus influenzae respectively. the third patient had septicemia due to  streptococcus pneumoniae type 22, despite vaccination and a cd4 count above 700/mm3. in splenectomized hiv-infected patients the number of cd4 lymphocytes should be interpreted with caution, as this number increases after splenectomy. the cd4 percentage and cd4/cd8 ratio correlated better with the clinical stage of hiv infection and gave more valuable indications as to the degree of immunosuppression. a possible correlation between viremia and the number of cd4 lymphocytes in this subset of patients remains to be established. in hiv-infected patients, infections due to s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, s. aureus and enteric gram-negative bacteria are frequent. after splenectomy, susceptibility to encapsulated bacteria increases even in hiv-negative patients. early vaccination  against the main strains of s. pneumoniae is essential, as vaccinal response is uncertain in patients with less than 400 cd4/mm3.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich peptide derived from a  putative porcine precursor protein of a novel family of antibacterial peptides.
AB  == it has long been speculated that porcine cathelin is an n-terminal fragment of a  longer precursor protein which possesses antimicrobial activity. in an attempt to find such a precursor, a cdna clone was recently isolated and sequenced by screening a cdna library from porcine bone marrow. in order to identify the functional activity of the putative protein encoded by an open reading frame, we  have synthesized various lengths of peptides that correspond to the c-terminal region of the protein and examined them for their antimicrobial activities. we found that a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich region with the sequence of vrrfpwwwpflrr had strong antimicrobial activity with a wide spectrum. it showed potency against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus group d as well  as aspergillus fumigatus. the action of this peptide is bactericidal rather than  bacteriostatic and this activity is completely inhibited by 2 mm mgcl2. our results indicate that the previously identified putative precursor encoded by the isolated cdna indeed possesses a potent antimicrobial activity and that this 13 amino acid synthetic peptide is considered to be a potentially effective drug against various infectious agents.

TI  == clinical applications of a new parenteral antibiotic in the treatment of severe bacterial infections.
AB  == cephalosporins are one of the mainstays of antibiotic therapy, and third-generation cephalosporins are first-line agents for the treatment of many types of serious infections, including those of nosocomial origin. gaps in activity of currently available third-generation cephalosporins such as cefotaxime, cefoperazone, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime, and increasing reports of gram-negative bacilli resistance to some of these agents, especially klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter spp., make it necessary to investigate new compounds. cefepime, a fourth-generation cephalosporin with a wide range of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multi-resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae, was evaluated in comparison with ceftazidime for the treatment of serious infections in hospitalized patients. ceftazidime is a commonly prescribed third-generation cephalosporin used for empiric treatment of serious infections such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and skin and skin-structure infection. this investigation was an open, randomized comparative study involving 882 patients in north america. cefepime 2 g every 12 hours demonstrated similar efficacy to that  of ceftazidime 2 g every 8 hours for the treatment of pneumonia and urinary tract infection (including cases associated with concurrent bacteremia), and skin and skin-structure infections. the bacteriologic responses were generally >85%. the most common pathogens isolated were escherichia coll, streptococcus pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and  streptococcus, group b. overall, approximately 94% of pathogens isolated in pretreatment cultures were susceptible to cefepime and ceftazidime. cefepime and  ceftazidime were well tolerated; only 3% of patients in each group discontinued therapy because of an adverse event. the most common adverse events were headache, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and rash. the results of this study indicate that cefepime is a promising, effective, and safe single-agent therapy for serious infections in hospitalized patients.

AB  == the selection of drug-resistant pathogens in hospitalized patients with serious infections such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections (uti), skin and skin-structure infections, and primary or secondary bacteremia has generally been ascribed to the widespread use of antimicrobial agents. issues of concern regarding gram-negative bacilli include the expression of extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumonias and constitutive resistance in some enterobacteriaceae caused by bush group 1 beta-lactamases. current concerns with gram-positive pathogens are increasing multidrug resistance in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci, and increasing incidence of penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. contemporary treatment strategies  for pneumonia in hospitalized patients mandate early empiric therapy for the most likely gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. newer beta-lactams, such as fourth-generation cephalosporins, may be useful in the treatment of pneumonia, including those cases associated with bacteremia. combination beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor drugs, an aminoglycoside co-drug, or a carbapenem may also be indicated. the initial treatment of uti in the hospital setting also may be empirically treated with the newer cephalosporins, combination broad-spectrum penicillins plus an aminoglycoside, a quinolone, or a  carbapenem. current problems in treating uti include the emergence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli, the tendency of fluoroquinolones both to select for resistant strains of major uti pathogens and  to induce cross-resistance among different drug classes, and beta-lactam and vancomycin resistance of enterococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci. treatment of skin and skin-structure infections is complicated by the coexistence of gram-positive and gram-negative infections, which may be drug resistant. both  fourth-generation beta-lactams and carbapenems may have in vitro activity against these pathogens; however, where these drugs--with their increased spectra and lower affinity for beta-lactamases and less susceptibility to beta-lactamase hydrolysis--fit into the therapeutic armamentarium remains to be determined. initial clinical studies appear to be promising, nonetheless. the ability of both nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens to develop resistance to powerful broad-spectrum agents presents a great challenge for prescribing patterns and in  the development of new drugs to be relatively resistant to inactivation.

TI  == evaluation of the use of bactec anaerobic blood cultures in the detection of bacteraemia and fungaemia in children.
AB  == in an attempt to reduce costs, the role of bactec anaerobic blood culture in the  detection of bacteraemia and fungaemia in children was evaluated. results from 3167 sets of aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures from children admitted to the university hospital, kuala lumpur during a one year period, were analysed. four hundred and eight (12.9%) sets of blood cultures were positive, of which 348 sets (11.0%) from 201 patients were clinically significant. of the 348 significant positive sets, organisms were isolated on 177 (50.9%) occasions from both aerobic and anaerobic bottles, on 136 (39.1%) occasions from the aerobic bottle only and  35 (10.0%) occasions from the anaerobic bottle only. no strict anaerobes were isolated, but clinically significant isolates recovered from the anaerobic bottle only included klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella species, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae and group b streptococcus. patients with bacteraemia diagnosed solely by anaerobic culture were distributed evenly across the various paediatric subspecialities. when results from the anaerobic bottles were excluded, the overall isolation rate was reduced from 11% to 9.9%. potential financial savings  resulting from omission of anaerobic cultures must be balanced against the small  number of bacteraemic episodes that could be missed. undiagnosed bacteraemia may  result in increased morbidity and mortality with its own attendant financial implications.

TI  == brodimoprim: effects of subminimal inhibitory concentrations on virulence traits  of respiratory and urinary tract pathogens, and on plasmid transfer and stability.
AB  == the effects of brodimoprim, a new trimethoprim analogue, on several virulence traits of respiratory and urinary tract pathogens exposed to sub-lethal levels of the drug was studied. adherence to tracheal epithelial cells was inhibited by brodimoprim in klebsiella pneumoniae (41-67% reduction), moraxella catarrhalis (87-90%) and haemophilus influenzae (0-53%), while in streptococcus pneumoniae binding was unaffected. with buccal epithelial cells the comparison between treated and control bacteria indicated statistically significant reduction in adherence with both s.pneumoniae and h.influenzae, (p < 0.015). with m.catarrhalis and streptococcus pyogenes only marginal changes were detected (p > 0.05). exoenzyme and capsule production were assessed in at least three isolates  of diverse respiratory pathogens grown in the presence of sub-lethal levels of the new agent. the drug affected protease and beta-hemolysin (alpha-toxin) production in both oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant s.aureus. on the contrary, synthesis of lipase, dnase, coagulase, and beta-lactamase (s.aureus), pneumolysin (s.pneumoniae), streptolysin s, dnase, and protease (s.pyogenes), capsule (k.pneumoniae, h.influenzae and s.pneumoniae), and beta-lactamase (k.pneumoniae, h.influenzae and m.catarrhalis) were not inhibited by subminimal inhibitory concentrations (sub-mics) of the drug. finally, motility was blocked in urinary pathogens e.coli, p.mirabilis and p.aeruginosa, while in this latter microorganism pigment production was also affected. high molecular weight low-copy f'lac, and low molecular weight high-copy phsg298 plasmids were eliminated from e.coli treated with sub-mic concentrations of brodimoprim. the incidence and cured cells ranged from 9% for f'lac to 23% for phsg298. f'lac transfer was also inhibited by the drug. when conjugation was carried out with bacteria exposed to brodimoprim (5xmic), a reduction (50%) in the number of recombinants was noted in comparison to the control. the fact that brodimoprim interferes with the expression of some virulence traits, in particular with adherence, at sub-mic levels may assist the drug in eradicating respiratory pathogens from the epithelial lining, thus diminishing the probability of reinfection.

TI  == escherichia coli lobar pneumonia: fatal infection in a patient with mental retardation.
AB  == lobar pneumonia due to escherichia coli is rare. most lobar pneumonias are caused by either streptococcus pneumoniae or klebsiella pneumoniae, and most e coli pneumonias are bronchopneumonias. we report an acute fulminant course of e coli lobar pneumonia in a 37-year-old patient who was profoundly retarded, institutionalized, and nonimmunosuppressed and who died within 2 days of developing initial symptoms. antemortem blood and postmortem blood and lung specimens isolated pure cultures of e coli. the source of infection in e coli lobar pneumonia is not clear in this patient or in the few cases that have been reported. we postulate that nasopharyngeal colonization of e coli in those who are institutionalized with mental retardation may predispose these patients to e  coli pneumonia. our case illustrates features of pneumonias that are unique in the institutionalized, mentally retarded patient population (ie, the relatively high prevalence of nasopharyngeal colonization of e coli, a higher incidence of e coli pneumonia than in other institutionalized populations, the often fulminant course of the disease), as well as the need for early, aggressive treatment including antibiotics effective against gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == we measured adenosine deaminase (ada) activity in a guinea pig model of legionella pneumophila infection. female hartley guinea pigs were inoculated intraperitoneally with one-quarter of the ld50 dose of l. pneumophila philadelphia-1 strain. control groups were inoculated with clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae or klebsiella pneumoniae. each group consisted of 5 animals. ada activity in plasma  was assayed calorimetrically before and at various intervals after infection by measuring the amount of ammonia produced after adenosine was added to plasma samples. ada activity before inoculation was 25.6 +/- 6.0 iu/1, it reached 174.4  +/- 60.0 iu/1 on day 3 after inoculation of l. pneumophila. ada activity returned to normal levels on day 14. ada activity did not increase significantly in guinea pigs infected with the other types of bacteria. these findings suggest that measurement of plasma ada activity may be useful for the diagnosis of legionella  infection.

TI  == [susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1994)].
AB  == bacteria isolated from lower respiratory tract infections were collected in cooperation with institutions located throughout japan, since 1981. ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. results obtained from these investigations are discussed. in 23 institutions around the entire japan, 492 strains of presumably  etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputum of 421 patients with lower respiratory tract infections from october 1994 to september 1995. mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 70 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 101 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 92 strains of  haemophilus influenzae, 61 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 25 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 48 strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, 14 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the drug susceptibilities of these strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. 1. s. aureus. s. aureus strains for which mics of oxacillin were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) accounted for 51.4%, but the frequency of the drug resistant bacteria decreased comparing to the previous year's 56.0%. vancomycin showed the highest activity against s. aureus with mic80 of 0.5 microgram/ml. 2. s. pneumoniae. most of the drugs tested showed potent activities against s. pneumoniae. imipenem of carbapenems showed the most potent activity with mic80 was 0.063 microgram/ml. erythromycin and clindamycin showed low activities with mic80s > or = 256 micrograms/ml. among these strains, however, 46.5% and 68.3% of strains, were quite sensitive toward these agents, respectively, with mics of 0.063 microgram/ml. 3. h. influenzae. the activities of all drugs were potent against h. influenzae tested. cefmenoxime a cephem, showed the most potent activity, the mics of this drug against all of the 92 strains were 0.063 microgram/ml. ofloxacin also showed a potent activity, and inhibited about 96% of strains with mic of 0.063 microgram/ml. 4. p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains). tobramycin showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains) with mic80 of 0.5 microgram/ml. gentamicin, arbekacin and ciprofloxacin showed next potent activities, and their mic80s were 2 micrograms/ml. 5. p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). tobramycin showed the most  potent activity against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains) with mic80 of 2 micrograms/ml. comparing to the activities against p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains), the activities of all the drugs tested were lower against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). 6. k. pneumoniae. carumonam showed the most potent activity against k. pneumoniae with mic80 of 0.063 microgram/ml. cefozopran showed the next most potent activity with mic80 of 0.125 microgram/ml. ampicillin and cephems except cefpodoxime, cefozopran and cefditoren showed low activities and their mic80s were > or = 16 micrograms/ml, and their mics were all higher than >  or = 4 micrograms/ml. 7. m. (b.) catarrhalis. imipenem and ofloxacin showed the most potent activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, their mic80s were 0.063 microgram/ml. erythromycin and minocycline showed the next highest activities with their mic80s at 0.25 microgram/ml. also, we investigated year to year changes in the background of patients, the respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology of bacteria. patients characteristics, in this period of investigation showed varieties of infectious diseases found in patients in a high age bracket, and the patients over age 60 accounted for 62.0% of all the cases. different lower respiratory tract infectious were distributed as follows: chronic bronchitis and bacterial pneumonia accounted for the greatest number of cases with 35.6%, 27.1%, respectively, followed by

AB  == the serum bactericidal activities of ceftizoxime and ceftriaxone against organisms commonly implicated in community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonias were studied. ceftizoxime 1 g (as the sodium salt) every 12 hours for two doses and ceftriaxone 1 g (as the sodium salt) every 24 hours for two doses were administered to 20 healthy volunteers in a crossover fashion. blood samples were  drawn immediately before and 2,4,6,8,10, and 12 hours after the second ceftizoxime dose and immediately before and 8,12,16,18,20, and 24 hours after the second ceftriaxone dose. serum drug concentrations were determined by validated high-performance liquid chromatography. serum bactericidal titers were determined in duplicate for each serum sample against four clinical isolates of each of the  following organisms: streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, and  serratia marcescens. the median duration of serum bactericidal activity during the dosage interval was significantly different between antimicrobial regimens only for s. pneumoniae (92% of the dosage interval for ceftizoxime, versus 100% for ceftriaxone). this difference does not appear to be clinically important since ceftizoxime provides adequate serum bactericidal activity for more than 50% of the dosage interval and its effectiveness against pneumococcal pneumonia has been supported in clinical trials. the ceftriaxone and ceftizoxime regimens did not differ significantly in their duration of serum bactericidal activity against six of the seven organisms tested.

TI  == an evaluation of the in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB  == tazobactam is a new, irreversible inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases of staphylococci, plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of the tem and shv types found in escherichia coli and klebsiella species and beta-lactamases of anerobes such as bacteroides species. its combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum ureido-penicillin, would be expected to improve the activity of piperacillin against staphylococci, tem and shv beta-lactamase producing gram negative bacteria and anerobes. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of piperacillin/tazobactam were determined for 1952 individual patient isolates of gram positive and negative bacteria causing significant infections and compared with mic values for cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid. mics were determined by agar dilution (nccls 1990 and 1992). piperacillin/tazobactam had excellent activity against methicillin susceptible staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, enterococci and organisms of the bacteroides fragilis group. it was also active against the majority of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates tested. it was not active against extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing klebsiella species and some high level tem and shv beta-lactamase producing e. coli and klebsiella species. activity against gram negative organisms capable of producing chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases was good, since in most organisms tested, the enzymes were not induced in sufficient quantities to cause antibiotic resistance. however some enterobacter species were derepressed hyperproducing mutants; these isolates showed resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam since tazobactam does not inhibit these class i beta lactamases. activity was superior to ticarcillin/clavulanic acid for gram negative rods. imipenem was the most active agent against esbl producing klebsiella species. piperacillin/tazobactam has a suitable spectrum of activity in vitro to suggest its use in monotherapy of mixed anerobic infections, mixed respiratory infections such as aspiration pneumonia and, in combination with an aminoglycoside, it would provide gram positive as well as gram negative cover of  febrile episodes in immunosuppressed patients.

TI  == spontaneous bacterial empyema in cirrhotic patients: a prospective study.
AB  == spontaneous bacterial empyema (sbem) is an infection of a preexisting hydrothorax in cirrhotic patients and has seldom been reported. to determine its incidence and primary characteristics, all cirrhotic patients with pleural effusion underwent thoracentesis at our hospital either on admission or when an infection  was suspected. pleural fluid (pf) study included biochemical analysis, polymorphonuclear (pmn) leukocyte count, and culture by two methods: conventional and modified (inoculation of 10 ml of pf into a blood culture bottle at the bedside). sbem was defined according to previously reported criteria: pf culture  positive or pmn count greater than 500 cells/micro l, and exclusion of parapneumonic effusions. sixteen of the 120 (13 percent) cirrhotic patients admitted with hydrothorax had 24 episodes of sbem. in 10 of the 24 episodes (43 percent), sbem was not associated with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (sbp). pf culture was positive by the conventional method in 8 episodes (33 percent) and by the modified method (blood culture inoculation) in 18 (75 percent) (p = .004,  mcnemar). the microorganisms identified in pf were escherichia coli in 8 episodes, streptococcus species in 4, enterococcus species in 3, klebsiella pneumoniae in 2, and pseudomonas stutzeri in 1. all episodes were treated with antibiotics without inserting a chest tube in any case. mortality during treatment was 20 percent. we conclude that sbem is a common complication of cirrhotic patients with hydrothorax. almost half of the episodes were not associated with sbp; thus, thoracentesis should be performed in patients with cirrhosis, pleural effusion, and suspected infection. culture of pf should be performed by inoculating 10 ml into a blood culture bottle at the bedside.

TI  == cation and sugar selectivity determinants in a novel family of transport proteins.
AB  == a new family of homologous membrane proteins that transport galactosides-pentoses-hexuronides (gph) is described. by analysing the aligned amino acid sequences of the gph family, and by exploiting their different specificities for cations and sugars, we have designed mutations that yield novel insights into the nature of ligand binding sites in membrane proteins. mutants have been isolated/constructed in the melibiose transport proteins of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella typhimurium, and the lactose transport protein of streptococcus thermophilus which facilitate uncoupled transport or have an altered cation and/or substrate specificity. most of the mutations map in the amino-terminal region, in or near amphipathic alpha-helices ii and iv, or in  interhelix-loop 10-11 of the transport proteins. on the basis of the kinetic properties of these mutants, and the primary and secondary structure analyses presented here, we speculate on the cation binding pocket of this family of transporters. the regulation of the transporters through interaction with, or phosphorylation by, components of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system is also discussed.

TI  == diffusion of 3-quaternary ammonium cephem antibiotics into cerebrospinal fluid of patients with bacterial meningitis.
AB  == cefepime and cefpirome are new beta-lactamase resistant parenteral cephalosporin  derivatives whose spectrum of activity makes them suitable for use in the treatment of severe infections such as bacterial meningitis. however, the published information on the penetration of these new agents into human csf and on their use in the treatment of bacterial meningitis are really scarce. experimental studies have shown that cefepime and cefpirome penetrated remarkably well into the csf of animals infected with streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae type b or pseudomonas aeruginosa. the mean changes in bacterial colony count in csf after cefpirome or cefepime administration express the antibacterial activity of these drugs. studies in patients show that cefepime and cefpirome crossed the blood-brain barrier and reached concentrations in the csf that are bactericidal against most potential pathogens. higher levels are likely to be achieved with multiple dosing and in the presence of inflamed meninges. no study has been performed to investigate the efficacy of cefpirome in the treatment of bacterial meningitis. cefepime was as effective and safe as cefotaxime for treatment of patients with bacterial meningitis as shown in the only clinical trial.

TI  == [stimulation of synthesis of secretory immunoglobulin a in the lung by oral immunization: an approach with therapeutic relevance?].
AB  == due to its strategic position on mucosal surfaces secretory immunoglobulin a (siga) is one of the first protective factors of the specific immune system against invading pathogens. as a factor of acquired immunity, the synthesis of siga can be modulated by various immunization strategies. our experiments aimed at the enhancement of the siga pool in the lungs by oral immunization. as reported previously, commercially available lw 50020, an immunomodulator consisting of lysates of seven common pneumotropic pathogens, is effective in inducing significant iga antibody responses in the lungs following oral immunization [1]. in the present study we developed new strategies to enhance this effect by encapsulating lw 50020 into microspheres and liposomes. microspheres and liposomes with entrapped immunomodulator each enhanced the effect of soluble lw 50020 by about 45% and 90%, respectively. in addition, microsphere based immunization induced a significantly increased immunoglobulin g (igg) response in the lungs. in further experiments we demonstrated that a similar effect could be achieved by administration of a high molecular weight conjugate of lipopolysaccharide from klebsiella pneumoniae (lps) and lipoteichoic acid from streptococcus pyogenes (lta). this conjugate enhanced the synthesis of  iga in the lungs by 45% and, furthermore, induced a significantly enhanced igg response in the lungs, without any obvious toxic or pyrogenic side effects. this  new conjugate possibly offers an opportunity to replace the complex immunomodulator lw 50020 by a less complex vaccine.

TI  == comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: results of eight european countries.
AB  == in this multicenter study conducted in eight european countries, 13,173 pathogens--all isolated from community-acquired infections in 1992 and 1993--were evaluated for their susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin g, ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. ten centers in italy, five in germany, in the netherlands and switzerland, four in greece and spain, three in hungary and one in finland contributed to this study; ready-to-use standardized microtiter panels (sceptor system, bbl, heidelberg, germany) were used throughout all assays. the most frequently encountered species were: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and non-typhoid salmonella spp., enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus agalactiae, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter freundii, staphylococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, proteus  vulgaris, moraxella catarrhalis and shigella spp. the percentage of susceptible isolates was assessed for each of the above-mentioned countries and european-wide with all the data available. for many species, the percentage of resistant isolates did not differ markedly between the countries considered. however, one of the most striking exceptions was the high prevalence of high-level penicillin-g-resistant s. pneumoniae isolates in hungary and spain; some of the low-level penicillin-g-resistant strains remained susceptible to cefuroxime, whereas complete cross-resistance occurred for all other beta-lactams studied. the high frequency of ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae isolates in spain deserves mentioning; this could be attributed mainly to the prevalence of a beta-lactamase, as the addition of clavulanic acid rendered these strains susceptible to ampicillin. the penicillin compounds exhibited the greatest activity against gram-positive pathogens, whereas cefetamet was the most active agent against gram-negative pathogens with a well-balanced spectrum of activity.

AB  == plasma fibronectic (pfn) is a high molecular weight multifunction glycoprotein, which augments neutrophil and macrofage phagocytosis and acts as a nonspecific opsonin for the reticuloendothelial system. in this study we have determined pfn  concentrations in fifty eight preterm infants to discriminate infected from non infected ones. concentrations of pfn decreased from baselin in babies with early  or late onset infections. the changes in pfn concentrations were not found before sepsis, but on day 1. by day 5 pfn concentrations have increased and have been no longer different from controls. we have calculated sensitivity (73.68%), specificity (74.36%), positive (58.35%) and negative (85.29%) predictive values of pfn and of other markers of infections (c-reactive protein--crp-, immature/mature neutrophil ratio--i/m n. ratio-). adding these tests to pfn, provided equal specificity and positive predictive value, but increased sensitivity (94.73%) and negative predictive value (96.43%). thus, low concentrations of pfn may be a valuable but not early marker for neonatal infections. the combination of pfn, crp and i/m n. ratio increase the precision of diagnostic testing.

TI  == bacterial pneumonia in recipients of bone marrow transplantation. a five-year prospective study.
AB  == bacterial pneumonia as an important complication of bone marrow transplantation (bmt) has not been subjected to comprehensive analysis. two hundred fifty-five consecutive allogeneic and autologous bmt recipients, ranging in age from 1 month to 53 years, were prospectively followed for 3 days to 3 years (median, 108 days) for development of bacterial pneumonia. etiology, place acquired, chest radiography, and outcome were recorded and the association between bacterial pneumonia and demographic and clinical variables was analyzed. thirty-seven (15%) patients experienced 52 episodes of bacterial pneumonia: onset of 13 episodes occurred within 30 days after transplantation, 10 episodes occurred on days +31 to +100, and 29 episodes occurred thereafter. bacterial pneumonia was the terminal event or contributed to fatal outcome in 8 patients (22% of bacterial pneumonia cases, 3% total study population). mortality due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (6/21) was significantly higher than (p = 0.03). bacterial pathogens were identified in 27 (52%) episodes. during the first 100 days after bmt, hospital-acquired gram-negative bacteria predominated, caused mainly by pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter lwoffi, and enterobacter cloacae. after day +100, community-acquired, gram-positive bacteria  predominated, particularly streptococcus pneumoniae. haemophilus influenzae occurred periodically. considering all episodes, significant association was found between bacterial pneumonia and veno-occlusive disease (vod) (p < 0.01) and chronic graft-versus-host disease (gvhd) (p < 0.02). for culture-positive episodes, the association between bacterial pneumonia and vod was significant (p  < 0.001) and borderline for acute gvhd (p = 0.07). it is concluded that vod and gvhd are positively associated with post-bmt bacterial pneumonia. its incidence,  etiology, risk factors, and outcome are important considerations in its prevention and treatment.

TI  == activation of human endothelial cells by viable or heat-killed gram-negative bacteria requires soluble cd14.
AB  == in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (lps; endotoxin), endothelial cells  are converted to an activation phenotype expressing both proinflammatory and procoagulant properties that include the induction of leukocyte adhesion molecules and tissue factor expression. lps-induced endothelial cell activation requires a soluble form of the monocyte lps receptor, scd14. we evaluated the capacity of multiple strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to induce endothelial e-selectin and tissue factor expression through scd14-dependent pathways with cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huve). both viable and heat-killed gram-negative bacteria (bacteroides fragilis, enterobacter cloacae, haemophilus influenzae, and klebsiella pneumoniae) but not  viable or heat-killed gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) induced prominent e-selectin surface expression detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. tissue factor activity  on huve, indicated by factor x activation, was induced in response to gram-negative bacteria but not in response to gram-positive bacteria. gram-negative bacteria induced transcriptional activation in huve, indicated by the appearance of e-selectin-specific mrna and by the demonstration of activation of nf-kappa b, a trans-activating factor necessary for e-selectin and tissue factor gene transcription. in contrast, neither e-selectin mrna nor activation of nf-kappa b was detected in huve treated with gram-positive bacteria. endothelial  cell activation by gram-negative bacteria in each of these assays was inhibited with a monoclonal antibody (60bd) against cd14. furthermore, cho-k1 cells, transfected with human recombinant cd14, responded to all strains of gram-negative bacteria (viable or heat killed), indicated by cho-k1 nf-kappa b activation. we conclude that gram-negative bacteria induce endothelial cell activation through a common scd14-dependent pathway.

TI  == in vivo evaluation of three acid-stable azalide compounds, l-701,677, l-708,299 and l-708,365 compared to erythromycin, azithromycin and clarithromycin.
AB  == l-701,677, l-708,299 and l-708,365 are novel azalide derivatives of erythromycin  that exhibit improved acid stability over erythromycin, azithromycin and clarithromycin. the half-life in aqueous solution at ph = 2.1 of these compounds  ranged from 0.3 hour for erythromycin to 16.2 hours for l-708,299. the rank order of half-life in acid solution from most to least stable was l-708,299 > l-701,677 > l-708,365 > azithromycin = clarithromycin > erythromycin. in a disseminated streptococcus pyogenes mouse infection model, azithromycin and l-708,365 were slightly more efficacious than clarithromycin, l-701,677 and l-708,299; all 5 compounds being more active than erythromycin. in a klebsiella pneumoniae pulmonary challenge mouse model, azithromycin, l-701,677, l-708,299 and l-708,365 were all equal in efficacy and at least four-fold more active than clarithromycin and erythromycin. clarithromycin, l-708,365 and interestingly erythromycin, showed greater bacterial clearance than azithromycin, l-701,677 and l-708,299 in  a localized infection model that measured clearance of staphylococcus aureus from mouse thigh tissues. our results indicate that l-701,677, l-708,299 and l-708,365 exhibit improved acid stability and were at least equally efficacious as presently marketed macrolide/azalide antibiotics.

TI  == virulence factors in the colonization and persistence of bacteria in the airways.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa are commonly isolated from sputum specimens of patients with lower respiratory tract  infections. haemophilus influenzae, s. pneumoniae, and m. catarrhalis have several pathogenic properties in common. these bacteria are able to interact with mucus, to exert ciliotoxic activity, to adhere to bronchial epithelial cells, and to invade airway epithelium. haemophilus influenzae and s. pneumoniae strains persist for many months in the respiratory tract of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), despite the specific antibodies present in  serum and sputum against the persistent strain. especially during exacerbations persistent strains with changes in their antigenic composition are isolated. among h. influenzae strains, the antigenic characteristics of the outer membrane  protein composition vary. variation in s. pneumoniae occurs in capsular polysaccharides, the major immunogens of this bacterium. such variations affect the efficacy of the antibody-mediated defense mechanisms against the bacteria. between exacerbations, particularly h. influenzae, s. pneumoniae strains are recovered from the sputum of patients with copd. recovery may continue for periods up to 2 yr, although not continuously. besides ineffective antibody-mediated defense mechanisms, it is likely that hiding of the bacteria in tissue contributes to the persistence of these bacteria in patients with copd.

AB  == ear swabs from 350 patients with chronic otitis media attending different orthorhinolaryngological clinics at different hospitals and health centres in benin city and ekpoma in edo state were screened for the presence of bacterial agents of chronic otitis media. results revealed the presence of 19 different species indicating polymicrobial infections. species isolated comprised staphylococcus aureus (33.6%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.3%), proteus mirabilis  (17%), alcaligenes faecalis (6.2%) and klebsiella aerogenes (4.3%). others included escherichia coli (3.3%), proteus rettgeri (2.8%), and staphylococcus epidermidis (2.2%), klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, acinetobacter spp, proteus morgani, haemophilus influenzae, providencia spp, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, non-haemolytic streptococci and diphotheroids, each accounted for less than 2% of isolates. the study also showed a higher prevalence of chronic otitis media among males (55.7%) than females (44.3%). cases of chronic otitis media were highest among the age groups (0-5 years) with a prevalence rate of 50% and least among the 6-10 year age group with a prevalence rate of 14.9%. antibiogram of isolates revealed marked sensitivities (over 90% of the isolates) to ciproxin, tarivid, rocephin and fortum whereas over 70% were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. results have indicated that staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis are leading bacterial agents of otitis media and highlights the high risk involved in the use of penicillin, ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, cloxacillin and septrin in the management of chronic otitis media in our locality.

TI  == third generation oral cephalosporins: comparative in vitro kinetics.
AB  == in order to provide additional data on the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefetamet-pivoxil against respiratory pathogens, we determined the bactericidal kinetics of this antibiotic in comparison to cefixime and ceftibuten against h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, k. pneumoniae, e. coli, s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. time-kill studies were performed by using concentrations equal to a x mic, and 4 x mic of the antibiotics tested and different inocula (10(5), 10(7) and 10(9) cfu/ml). the strains were incubated in a shaking incubator at 37 degrees c and 1 ml samples were removed at regular intervals for viable count determination. the antibiotics were eliminated by serial ten-fold dilutions in physiological saline before plating. at 4 x mic of cefetamet and at 10(5) cfu/ml  inoculum the results were 99.9% killing or more of h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis at 4 h, and of e. coli and k. pneumoniae within 4 to 6 h, and of e. coli and k. pneumoniae within 4 to 6 h. at the same concentration of mic and with the same inoculum a 99.9% reduction was achieved against s. pneumoniae within 4 h and against s. pyogenes within 2 h with no regrowth at 24 h in both cases. similar results were obtained using 10(7) and 10(9) cfu/ml inocula. cefetamet had efficient killing activity even at lower concentrations. bactericidal kinetics of cefetamet favorably compare with those of cefixime and ceftibuten. the efficient  bactericidal activity of cefetamet-pivoxil indicates a clinical role for this new oral cephalosporin in the treatment of respiratory tract infections.

TI  == toc-39, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin with excellent activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == toc-39, a new parenteral cephalosporin, is a hydroxyimino-type cephem antibiotic  with vinylthio-pyridyl moiety at the 3 position. toc-39 was evaluated for antibacterial activity against various clinically isolated strains. toc-39 had excellent activity, stronger than that of methicillin, oxacillin, the cephalosporins tested, imipenem, gentamicin, minocycline, tobramycin, ofloxacin,  and ciprofloxacin against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and  had an mic comparable to that of vancomycin (the mics of toc-39 and vancomycin for 90% of the strains tested were 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively). against enterococcus faecalis strains, which are resistant to cephalosporins, toc-39 was twice as active as ampicillin. against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp., and streptococcus pneumoniae, toc-39 was twice as active as or more active than cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome. against streptococcus pyogenes, toc-39 was superior to cefotiam, ceftazidime, and flomoxef and was similar to cefpirome. in addition, the activity of toc-39 was equal to or greater than that of cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome against haemophilus influenzae, escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and morganella morganii. in terms of bactericidal effect against mrsa, toc-39 was superior to vancomycin. no mutant resistant to toc-39 or vancomycin was obtained from susceptible mrsa strains. in  murine systemic infection models, toc-39 showed potent activity against s. aureus and e. coli. against highly mrsa, the activity of toc-39 was comparable to that of vancomycin.

TI  == a single daily dose of ceftriaxone for bacterial meningitis in adults: experience with 84 patients and review of the literature.
AB  == although the pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone allows its administration in a single daily dose, this practice is not standard in the treatment of bacterial meningitis. herein, we review our experience and that of other investigators with this mode of therapy. we used a single daily dose of ceftriaxone (50 mg/[kg.d]; maximum, 4 g/d) for the treatment of bacterial meningitis in 84 adult patients. meningitis was due to neisseria meningitidis in 34 cases, to streptococcus pneumoniae in 25, to escherichia coli in three, to klebsiella pneumoniae in two,  to haemophilus influenzae in two, to viridans streptococci in two, and to an unknown agent in 16. eleven patients died, for an overall mortality of 13%; therapy failed in three additional cases. the mean trough levels of ceftriaxone in cerebrospinal fluid was 3.5 micrograms/ml; the median trough bactericidal titer at this site was 1:128. both our experience and that in the literature suggest that a single daily dose is optimal when ceftriaxone is used for the treatment of bacterial meningitis.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of sulbactam/ampicillin against clinically isolated microbial strains].
AB  == antimicrobial activities were examined for sulbactam/ampicillin (sbt/abpc) against clinically isolated microbial strains in 1987, 1990, 1994. besides, the beta-lactamase productivity and mics of these strains were measured, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. the ratio of beta-lactamase producing strains were 90% of methicillin (dmppc)-susceptible staphylococcus aureus subsp.  aureus (mssa), about 80% of dmppc-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), 100% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis, 95% of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis and 15-20% of haemophilus influenzae.  several kinds of beta-lactamase productivity were observed. 2. antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc against beta-lactamase producing strains of mssa, m. (b.)  catarrhalis, h. influenzae, and almost all of enterobacteriaceae were stronger than those of ampicillin (abpc) and piperacillin (pipc), but antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were weak against mrsa and cephems (ceps)-resistant strains detected in some of enterobacteriaceae. 3. it appeared that benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive streptococcus pneumoniae (pisp) or pcg-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) and ceps-resistant escherichia coli increased  year by year. 4. antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were strong against streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, m. (b.) catarrhalis and h. influenzae including beta-lactamase producing strains. additionally, beta-lactamase inhibiting effect of sbt was observed against beta-lactamase produced by s. aureus and k. pneumoniae which demonstrate indirect pathogenicity. thus, sbt/abpc is an injectable antibiotic that is expected to demonstrate clinical usefulness,  especially as the first line drug for the respiratory tract infections that are community-acquired.

TI  == a 4-year study of neonatal meningitis: clinical and microbiological findings.
AB  == the clinical and microbiological data of 60 neonates, 23 from the neonatal unit (group i) and 37 (group ii) from the general paediatric wards with meningitis are presented. the overall prevalence/1000 was significantly lower in group i (0.36)  than in group ii (1.11; p < 0.0001). this low incidence follows the introduction  of amikacin for the treatment of the ill neonate in 1986. streptococcus agalactiae 21 (35 per cent), klebsiella pneumoniae 17 (28 per cent) and e. coli 10 (17 per cent) were the commonest pathogens accounting for 80 per cent of the cases. streptococcus agalactiae isolates were uniformly susceptible to penicillin and chloramphenicol. gram negative isolates showed resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol and sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim. in addition k. pneumoniae isolates showed resistance to gentamycin and amikacin. all isolates were fully susceptible to cefotaxime. recently, four of six cases of k. pneumoniae in the neonatal unit were resistant to amikacin. low birth weight, additional clinical problems, and ultrasound changes on cranial scanning carried a poor prognosis. emphasis should be placed on close collaboration between clinicians and microbiologists in the choice of antimicrobial agents and aseptic techniques for  the care of neonates.

TI  == [susceptibility of bacterial isolates from the equine respiratory tract to trimethoprim, sulfadoxine, sulfadimethoxine and combinations of these compounds].
AB  == using a broth microdilution technique, the in vitro susceptibility of bacterial isolates from the equine respiratory tract to trimethoprim, sulfadoxine, sulfadimethoxine, and combinations of these compounds was determined. the bacterial strains (n = 88) isolated recently from horses with respiratory symptoms belonged to the following species: streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (n = 34), streptococcus equi subsp. equi (n = 22), staphylococcus aureus (n = 9), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 7), rhodococcus equi (n = 4), pseudomonas spp. (n = 3) and escherichia coli (n = 3). in addition, two isolates  of enterobacter spp. and one isolate of streptococcus equisimilis, staphylococcus intermedius, proteus mirabilis and serratia marcescens were examined. for determination of susceptibility of an organism the following minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) were fixed as limiting values: trimethoprim < or = 0.5 microgram/ml, sulfadoxine < or = 32 micrograms/ml, sulfadimethoxine < or = 32 micrograms/ml, trimethoprim/sulfadoxine < or = 0.5/32 micrograms/ml, trimethoprim/sulfadimethoxine < or = 0.5/32 micrograms/ml. as expected, rhodococcus-equi-isolates were resistant to the antimicrobials tested. however, most of the clinically more common isolates showed a high degree of susceptibility to the combinations. the fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) indices indicated synergism of the combination-partners in a wide range. according to these in vitro results, application of trimethoprim/sulfonamide combinations for the initial therapy of equine respiratory tract infections can be recommended.

TI  == [nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1991. in this study, identifications and susceptibility  testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. the susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by nccls. staphylococcus aureus and cns showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (dmppc). streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to  many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. though enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (abpc), piperacillin (pipc), imipenem (ipm), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st) compounds, enterococcus faecium was resistant  to almost all antibacterial agents but to st compounds. high susceptibility rates were observed for strains of enterobacter cloacae to ipm, gentamicin (gm) and ofloxacin (oflx) and for strains of proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (lmox), ipm, aztreonam (azt), gm and oflx. serratia marcescens and bacteroides fragilis group  were highly susceptible only to ipm. pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (caz), ipm, amikacin (amk) and tobramycin (tob). pseudomonas cepacia  was relatively susceptible only to caz. ipm showed strong antibacterial activity  to many species except for s. aureus and cns.

TI  == the aetiology of severe community-acquired pneumonia and its impact on initial, empiric, antimicrobial chemotherapy.
AB  == of 259 patients admitted to an intensive care unit with severe acute community-acquired pneumonia, 173 had primary infections and 86 had secondary infections. the commonest organism isolated in each group was streptococcus pneumoniae (51.3 and 36.6% of known isolates in each group respectively). klebsiella pneumoniae was the next most common isolate (31.9 and 29.3% respectively). a variety of other gram-negative organisms and staphylococcus aureus accounted for most of the remaining pathogens. based on retrospective analysis of data, there appeared to be no difference in the alcohol consumption of patients with infection due to s. pneumoniae and k. pneumoniae. the overall mortality rate for the primary infections was 47.4%, with 68.4% of these infections due to k. pneumoniae and 33.9% due to the pneumococcus (p < 0.002). among the secondary infections, the overall mortality rate was 40.8% (not significantly different to that of primary infections) with 45.5% due to k. pneumoniae and 23.1% due to the pneumococcus (not significantly different on statistical analysis, probably due to low patient numbers). our investigation confirms that severe community-acquired pneumonia due to k. pneumoniae is extremely common, even in patients without obvious risk factors for gram-negative colonization. this organism is contributing to the high mortality rate seen in our intensive care unit among patients with pneumonia, and our empiric therapy for such cases routinely includes a combination of agents active against this organism (e.g. a cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside).

AB  == an analysis of the features of lower respiratory diseases (lrd) associated with respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) in 21 children aged 1-23 months, indicated that the clinical features did not differ appreciably from those described for lrd due to other infective agents. it was however, remarkable that none of the children was grossly malnourished, neither was there any death. the final respiratory diagnoses were bronchiolitis alone (6 cases), bronchopneumonia (6 cases), empyema/pleural effusion (3 cases, including one with bronchopneumonia), lobar pneumonia (3 cases, including one with associated bronchopneumonia). streptococcus pneumonia and klebsiella pneumoniae respectively, were isolated from blood culture in the two cases with lobar pneumonia alone. one child had laryngotracheobronchitis (croup) alone and another, croup associated with bronchiolitis and bronchopneumonia. radiologically, the single most common lesion was patchy consolidation (8 cases) followed by hyper-inflation (6 cases); in one  case, there was no observable lesion on the chest radiograph. all the 6 children  who had bronchiolitis alone were aged 12 months and below, and were well nourished; conversely, 8 of the 12 children with pneumonia alone or in addition to other lesions and both children with pleural effusion, were older than 12 months and underweight. other viral agents were identified in 8 (38%) of the cases. complications included heart failure in 4 cases and a combination of anaemia and heart failure in one child with empyema. in a child with symptom complex and radiological features suggestive of acute obstructive lower respiratory infection with immunofluorescence evidence of rsv infection, age and  nutritional status are important factors in determining the need for antibiotic therapy pending the outcome of bacterial cultures.

TI  == a prospective study of microorganisms in urine and bladder biopsies from interstitial cystitis patients and controls.
AB  == objectives: interstitial cystitis (ic) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the bladder of unknown etiology. we tested the hypothesis that a microorganism would  be found at higher prevalence in urine or bladder tissue from women with ic than  from control women. methods: urine and bladder tissue were obtained at cystoscopy from 11 ic patients and 7 control subjects. these specimens were cultured for a variety of fastidious and nonfastidious bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, and viruses. in addition, special staining techniques were used to examine biopsy specimens and cytospun urine, and tissue sections and outgrowths of explanted bladder cells were examined by electron microscopy. results: cultures of urine from 6 of 11 ic patients grew five different bacteria (corynebacterium sp. klebsiella pneumoniae, lactobacillus sp, streptococcus constellatus, and streptococcus morbillorum), human cytomegalovirus, or torulopsis glabrata; one of these organisms (lactobacillus sp) was found in urine from 2 patients. although contamination by urethral organisms is possible, the prevalence of microorganisms in urine of ic patients (6 of 11) was significantly greater than in urine of control subjects (0 of 7) (p < 0.05). acridine orange staining revealed rods with appropriate morphology in urine from 4 of the 5 ic patients who had positive bacterial cultures and yeastlike organisms in urine and bladder tissue specimens  that grew torulopsis. additionally, rodlike organisms were seen in urine from 2 ic patients with negative bacterial cultures and cocci were seen in the urine of  1 control patient. biopsy specimens from 2 ic patients grew torulopsis sp or lactobacillus sp, in agreement with the results of acridine orange staining and culture of urine from these patients; in contrast, specimens from 3 control subjects grew small numbers of pseudomonas sp or staphylococcus epidermidis, but  no organisms were cultured from urine or seen in acridine orange-stained tissue smears. all other cultures and stains were negative. conclusions: these data do not provide evidence that ic is associated with infection or colonization by a single microorganism. however, they do generate the hypothesis that the prevalence of microorganisms, especially bacteria at low concentrations, is greater in the urine of ic patients than of control subjects. if these results are confirmed by other controlled studies, the question of whether the presence of these organisms is a cause or a result of ic should be addressed.

TI  == influence of pulmonary surfactant on in vitro bactericidal activities of amoxicillin, ceftazidime, and tobramycin.
AB  == the influence of a natural pulmonary surfactant on antibiotic activity was investigated to assess the possible use of exogenous surfactant as a vehicle for  antibiotic delivery to the lung. the influence of surfactant on the bactericidal  activity of amoxicillin was tested against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae, and the influence of surfactant on the activities of ceftazidime and tobramycin was tested against klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa, s. aureus, and s. pneumoniae. in vitro antibiotic activity was determined by killing curve studies in media with and without surfactant. amoxicillin and ceftazidime activities were not changed in the presence of surfactant, except for a decreased killing rate of s. pneumoniae by ceftazidime in medium with additional rabbit serum. in contrast, killing curves with low concentrations of tobramycin (0.25x and 1x the mic) showed a decreased level of activity of tobramycin against all pathogens tested in the presence of surfactant. with higher tobramycin concentrations (4x the mic) killing rates were decreased less or were unchanged in the presence of surfactant. concluding from the results of the study, both amoxicillin and ceftazidime can be combined with surfactant without the loss of activity. for mixing surfactant with tobramycin, dosages should be adjusted to overcome the partial inactivation of tobramycin by  surfactant.

TI  == pulmonary penetration of ceftazidime.
AB  == for an antibiotic to be effective in lower respiratory tract infections, it should be available in adequate concentrations in respiratory tissues and fluids. cephalosporins usually achieve modest concentrations in the respiratory tract. in this study we have determined the pulmonary penetration of intramuscularly administered ceftazidime (a single dose of 1 g). levels of ceftazidime in bronchial secretions (bs), bronchial mucosa (bm), epithelial lining fluid (elf),  and serum (s) were measured by microbiological assay in 25 patients suffering from acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis who were divided into 5 groups of 5 subjects according to sampling time (1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 hours after the administration of the antibiotic). the peak s level was high (39.89 +/- 10.42 micrograms/ml at 1 hour) and mean s concentrations decreased slowly and were still detectable at 12 hours (1.07 +/- 0.45 microgram/ml). in all other samples,  mean concentrations were in excess of the ceftazidime minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) for many relevant respiratory pathogens (haemophilus influenzae 0.15 microgram/ml; moraxella catarrhalis 0.06 micrograms/ml; streptococcus pneumoniae 0.15 micrograms/ml; klebsiella pneumoniae 0.4 microgram/ml). concentrations in bm (7.05 +/- 2.38, 8.14 +/- 2.23, 6.40 +/- 1.63, 4.06 +/- 0.99 and 0.45 +/- 0.27 microgram/g) were higher than that in bs (6.87 +/- 1.96, 6.54 +/- 1.84, 3.52 +/- 1.23, 1.56 +/- 0.92 and 0.23 +/- 0.19 microgram/ml).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == structure and functions of endotoxin-binding peptides derived from cap18.
AB  == cap18 (cationic antimicrobial protein, 18kda) is a 142 amino acid protein originally isolated from rabbit granulocytes using agglutination of lps-coated erythrocytes as an assay. cap-18 is composed of an n-terminal domain of unknown function (cap181-105) and a c-terminal lps-binding domain (cap18106-142). synthetic cap18106-142 and cap18106-137, a 32-amino acid peptide resulting from the truncation of 5 amino acids from the c-terminus of cap18106-142, inhibited lps-induced tissue factor generation, nitric oxide production and tnf release by  macrophages. mice treated with cap18106-142 or cap18106-137 were significantly protected from lps lethality. although cap18106-142 and cap18106-137 were highly  active, other fragments of cap18106-142, including cap18110-142 with a truncated  n-terminus, did not exhibit lps-binding and lps-neutralizing activities. both peptides had broad anti-microbial activity against both gram-negative bacteria such as escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa (ic50; 40-100 nm) and gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus(methicillin sensitive and resistant strains) and streptococcus pneumoniae (ic50; 100-200nm). we cloned a cap18 family protein from human granulocytes. the cloned cdna encoded 140 amino acid residues. human cap18  (cap181-140) was highly homologous to that of rabbit. a 32- amino-acid c-terminal fragment (cap18104-135) was shown to bind lps, inhibit lps-induced tissue factor  generation by murine macrophages, and protect mice from lps lethality. this peptide exhibited antimicrobial activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. we hypothesize that cap18 and the derived peptides bind to lps and alter the capacity of lps to initiate disseminated intravascular coagulation. in this regard, cap may act as host defense protein against infectious diseases, and have therapeutic potential for sepsis and endotoxin shock.

TI  == trends in antimicrobial resistance among today's bacterial pathogens.
AB  == resistance of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens to antimicrobial agents is a serious problem with significant clinical consequences. microbiologic surveillance data, such as those provided by the national nosocomial infections surveillance system, supply information on current nosocomial pathogens in the united states. many species show resistance to commonly used antimicrobials and,  in many cases, it is emerging resistance. resistance in many gram-negative bacteria is caused by beta-lactamase production. escherichia coli, the leading nosocomial pathogen, is capable of hyperproducing tem-1 beta-lactamase. a novel form of resistance in klebsiella pneumoniae and e. coli is caused by extended-spectrum cephalosporinases. many enterobacteriaceae can be induced to produce group 1 beta-lactamase by exposure to broad-spectrum cephalosporins and other beta-lactams. thirty percent of haemophilus influenzae isolates are resistant to ampicillin because of beta-lactamase production. issues of concern in gram-positive species include multiple antimicrobial resistance in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and coagulase-negative  staphylococci, and increasing beta-lactam resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae. to minimize the development of resistance, antimicrobials must be administered judiciously, and infection-control practices must be instituted and followed.

TI  == [fundamental and clinical studies of sy5555 in pediatrics].
AB  == we assessed the in vitro antimicrobial activity and the clinical efficacy and safety of sy5555 in the field of pediatrics. the results obtained are summarized  below. 1. in vitro antibacterial activities of sy5555 against 52 clinical isolates were compared with those of clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (cva/ampc), cefotiam (ctm), cefpodoxime (cpdx), cefaclor (ccl) and cefdinir (cfdn). against gram-positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes, sy5555 displayed antimicrobial activities superior or nearly equivalent to those of the reference agents used in the study. in cases of gram-negative bacteria, the antimicrobial activity of sy5555 against haemophilus  influenzae was inferior to those of cpdx and cfdn. against klebsiella pneumoniae, the antimicrobial activity of sy5555 was less potent than that of cpdx. 2. forty-seven children with infectious diseases were treated with sy5555 dry syrup  (powder dissolved just before use). the clinical results were excellent in 24 and good in 16, with an efficacy rate of 85.1%. 3. bacteriological screening identified 30 pathogenic organisms, and the eradication rate was 76.7%. 4. side effects consisted of diarrhea in 12.5% (6 cases), loose stools in 4.2% (2 cases)  and urticaria in 2.1% (1 case) of the patients. the only abnormal laboratory test value observed was an increase in eosinophil count in one child. 5. the palatability of sy5555 dry syrup was very good; it was very easily ingestable or  easily ingestable by 32 of the 48 children. from the above results, sy5555 dry syrup appears to be a useful drug with a preferable safety profile in the treatment of pediatric patients with infectious diseases.

TI  == development of a polymerase chain reaction assay to detect the presence of streptococcus pneumoniae dna.
AB  == in this study, we have developed a chemically sensitive and specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay to detect the presence of streptococcus pneumoniae genomic dna. the target dna sequence was a 322-base pair segment of the s. pneumoniae dna polymerase i gene (pol i). pcr products of pure cultures of a set  of pneumococcal serotypes commonly associated with human infection could be amplified in water and in blood cultures of clinical isolates containing s. pneumoniae. we were able to detect 2 fg of purified s. pneumoniae dna. there were no false-positive reactions when the assay was performed on samples containing the following clinically encountered bacteria: haemophilus influenzae type b, neisseria meningitidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas spp. nontypeable h. influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and streptococcus pyogenes. the addition of edta and citrate-anticoagulated whole blood to the pcr reaction mixture inhibited the pcr  assay, whereas the addition of lithium heparin, sodium heparin, and sodium polyanetholesulfonate-anticoagulated whole blood to pcr reaction mixture did not  interfere with the ability to detect the presence of s. pneumoniae dna.

TI  == comparison of the antibody responses to the 77 klebsiella capsular types in ankylosing spondylitis and various rheumatic diseases.
AB  == the production of antibodies to klebsiella capsular polysaccharides was measured  in sera from either hla-b27-positive (hla-b27+) or hla-b27-negative (hla-b27-) patients with classical ankylosing spondylitis (n = 54). these sera were compared with sera from patients with various rheumatic diseases (n = 82) and hla-b27+ or  hla-b27- healthy individuals (n = 85). all sera were analyzed by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay specific to each of the 77 klebsiella serotypes. the sera from hla-b27+ patients with ankylosing spondylitis showed a significantly higher antibody frequency to the capsular types k26, k36, and k50 than the sera from hla-b27- ankylosing spondylitis patients, patients with psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, or reactive arthritis after yersinia enterocolitica infection, or healthy controls (p < 0.02). the antibodies were of the immunoglobulin g type. no significant antibody response to the other 74 klebsiella serotypes, noncapsulated mutants of  k26, k36, and k50, or preparations of citrobacter, serratia, hafnia, or morganella spp. or streptococcus pneumoniae could be detected. the results might  suggest a specific association between these capsular types and hla-b27+ ankylosing spondylitis and might imply their predominance in this disease.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of opc-17116, a new fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent, against important pathogens that cause respiratory tract infections was evaluated in vitro and in vivo and compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin. the pharmacokinetic profiles of opc-17116 were studied in both mice and rats given the drug orally at doses of 50 and 40 mg/kg of body weight, respectively. opc-17116 showed a high degree of distribution in the lung tissues of both species, with maximum concentrations of 29.6 and 32.0 micrograms/g, respectively. furthermore, the drug concentrations in lung tissue were about 10 to 15 times greater than the concentrations in plasma. opc-17116 showed potent antibacterial activity against such pathogens as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. the mics of this compound for  90% of these organisms except methicillin-resistant s. aureus and p. aeruginosa ranged from < or = 0.006 to 0.78 microgram/ml. the in vitro antibacterial activity of opc-17116 was reflected by the efficacy of a single oral dose against systemic bacterial infections in mice. opc-17116 showed a superior effect against gram-positive bacteria, h. influenzae, and m. catarrhalis. in comparison with the other reference compounds, the efficacy of opc-17116 was less than that of ciprofloxacin against k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa. opc-17116 showed a greater therapeutic effect than the other drugs against experimental acute pneumonia caused by these organisms in mice or rats. this excellent therapeutic effect against respiratory tract infections may be a result of its high level of distribution in lung tissue.

TI  == acute mastoiditis--revisited.
AB  == the clinical course and causative organisms were studied in 18 patients with acute mastoiditis, 13 of whom (72%) had no previous history of middle ear disease. their age ranged from 5 months to 21 years, and duration of middle ear symptoms immediately prior to admission ranged from 1 to 45 days (average 9.7 days). none had undergone a myringotomy prior to admission, while 13 (72%) had been receiving antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media. three were admitted with intracranial complications. bacteria were isolated in 10 of the 16 patients  in whom samples were available for bacterial culture, and included streptococcus  pneumonia (2), streptococcus pyogenes (2), staphylococcus aureus (2), staphlococcus coagulase negative (2), klebsiella pneumonia (1), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1). of the 17 patients treated by us, 11 received surgery. acute otitis media, secretory otitis media, acute mastoiditis, subacute mastoiditis and masked mastoiditis create a continuum. antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media cannot be considered as an absolute safeguard against acute mastoiditis. when antibiotics are prescribed for acute mastoiditis before culture result is available, an anti-staphylococcal agent should be included. at least some patients with acute mastoiditis develop a primary infection of the bony framework of the middle ear cleft. the prevalence of the intracranial complications in acute mastoiditis is still high and may appear soon after or concomitant with the first sign of acute mastioditis.

TI  == compartmentalization of specific b-cells in sheep mucosae associated lymphoid organs.
AB  == numerous studies have shown that peyer's patches (pp) contribute to the seeding of other lymphoid organs in sheep. this was demonstrated by perfusing labeled lymphocytes in pp, and later investigating their presence in drainage lymph nodes, spleen, peripheral blood or bone marrow. these data showed that pp export  considerable numbers of cells every day, but provided no information as to their  specificity. in this work, we used the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa)  spot method to investigate, in the peripheral blood, mesenteric and cervical lymph nodes and tonsils from ten sheep, the numbers of specific b-cells, directed to four common bacteria of the oro-pharyngeal area of mammals: streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae or klebsiella pneumoniae. the data were obtained from five sets of monozygous sheep, one animal of each pair being previously fed ribosomal preparations of these bacteria. both  prior to and after oral challenge, specific b-cells could be found in all the tissues tested. they were mostly igg-producing cells and preferentially located in oro-pharyngeal drainage lymph nodes and tonsils. their numbers increased in these lymph nodes after stimulation, while they decreased in mesenteric lymph nodes. these observations are consistent with the current hypothesis suggesting intestinal sensitization, proliferation and fast emigration of specific b-cells after oral challenge.

AB  == forty-three medical centers participated in a national (united states) surveillance study of parenteral antimicrobial agents as empiric therapy of pathogens isolated from blood, skin wounds, respiratory tract, and urine (> 8500  strains, 200 per laboratory). all laboratories tested each organism by the same reagent disks and/or etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) strips. quality control results validated all laboratories for analyses. the most common isolates were escherichia coli (1648), staphylococcus aureus (1408), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1003), klebsiella species (792), and the enterococci (684). among the tested drugs the percent susceptible rates observed were ofloxacin (83.4%), ciprofloxacin (82.0%), and cefuroxime (62.9%) tested against all organisms; cefazolin (54.7%) and ceftazidime (76.7%) tested against all nonfastidious aerobes; gentamicin (91.2%), imipenem (95.3%), ticarcillin-clavulanate (78.2%), and ceftriaxone (66.2%) tested against gram-negative organisms only; and vancomycin (97.9%) and erythromycin (49.2%) tested against gram-positive aerobes. several drug-resistant species appear to be emerging or increasing in the united  states: (a) vancomycin-resistant enterococci (7.9%, mostly enterococcus faecium); (b) oxacillin-resistant s. aureus (21.0%); (c) third-generation cephalosporin-resistant enterobacteriaceae, including e. coli and klebsiella species with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (approximately 1.3%-8.6%); (d) penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (17.8%); and (e) ciprofloxacin-resistant p. aeruginosa (14.9%). fluoroquinolone resistance among the enteric bacilli was confirmed in 60 of 66 referred strains (0.8% of total strains), and cross-resistance was high among ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, fleroxacin, and norfloxacin (98.3%-100%). seventeen strains of fluoroquinolone-resistant enteric bacilli (0.2% of total) also harbored an esbl and resistance to aminoglycosides. clonal spread within medical centers was observed with the esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae. this national clinical isolate data base continues to demonstrate broad fluoroquinolone efficacy (ofloxacin > ciprofloxacin) against hospital-based pathogens and many strains of  emerging resistant bacteria. continued us surveillance studies are urged to monitor emerging antimicrobial resistance and to guide interventions to minimize  its occurrence.

TI  == characterisation of an oxidative response inhibitor produced by streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == background: pneumonia caused by infection with streptococcus pneumoniae is still  a major clinical problem. reactive oxygen species contribute to the killing of these bacteria by polymorphonuclear leucocytes (pmns). defence mechanisms of str  pneumoniae which counter reactive oxygen species are characterised. methods: pmns were stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (pma) in the presence and absence  of str pneumoniae and supernatants from them, and superoxide (o2-) production was measured by the reduction of ferricytochrome c. results: streptococcus pneumoniae, but not klebsiella pneumoniae or staphylococcus aureus, inhibited pma stimulated superoxide production by pmns. washed pmns which had been preincubated with str pneumoniae autolysis phase supernatants also exhibited depressed h2o2 production in response to pma. the inhibitory activity was not attributable to non-specific cytotoxicity as assessed by release of the cytoplasmic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase, nor did the supernatants inhibit pma stimulated degranulation of pmns. fractionation of the autolysis phase supernatants revealed inhibitory activity in both the fractions greater than and less than 10 kd. like  pneumolysin the inhibitory activity was heat sensitive. however, both a parent and pneumolysin negative mutant str pneumoniae, and autolysis phase supernatants  from them, inhibited pmn superoxide production. antisera to pneumolysin failed to abrogate the inhibitory effect of intact str pneumoniae or autolysis phase supernatants from types 1 or 14 str pneumoniae. conclusions: the inhibitory effect of str pneumoniae on the respiratory burst of pmns is not shared by two other common lung pathogens. the existence of a novel inhibitor of the pmn respiratory burst, distinct from pneumolysin, has been demonstrated. the inhibitor is specific for the respiratory burst and is active both in the logarithmic phase of growth and during autolysis.

AB  == the efficacy of ribosomal preparations as mucosal immunostimulants was examined in the peripheral blood and tonsils of 14 children, before and after 28 days of oral treatment with d-53, a preparation of ribosomes from klebsiella pneumoniae,  streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pyogenes. tonsils from 10 untreated children were used as controls. immunofluorescence and  elisaspot were performed to analyse variations in the numbers of immunoglobulin-containing and immunoglobulin-secreting b-cells. both isotypic and antigenic specificities of these two types of cells were investigated. significant differences were observed after treatment in the peripheral blood as  well as between tonsils from treated and untreated children. in the peripheral blood a significant increase in immunoglobulin-secreting cells directed against antigenic specificities of d-53 was the major change. in tonsils, higher numbers  of specific immunoglobulin-containing and secreting cells, and higher numbers of  iga-secreting cells were induced in treated children. these data support the efficacy of d-53 as an oral immunostimulant.

TI  == the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis. a prospective study using ultrasound-guided transthoracic needle aspiration.
AB  == obstructive pneumonitis, the opacity that develops distal to an obstructing endobronchial lesion or external compression, is actually a combination of atelectasis, bronchiectasis with mucus plugging, and true parenchymal inflammation. in the majority of cases, it is usually not possible to determine whether infection is present or not from the radiographic findings alone. the aim of this study was to evaluate the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis and the influence of this result on the treatment of patients. from march 1992 to february 1993, 26 consecutive patients (20 men and six women) with obstructive pneumonitis were investigated. the obstructive pneumonitis had been caused by malignant tumors in 24 and benign lesions in two. chest ultrasound (us) and us-guided percutaneous transthoracic aspirations were undergone to obtain specimens for microbiologic examination. microorganisms were isolated from seven  of nine febrile patients and two of 17 nonfebrile patients. a total of 16 bacterial strains are detected in obstructive pneumonitis (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, viridant streptococci, bacteroides fragilis, two peptostreptococcus species, mycobacterium tuberculosis, pseudomonas maltophilia, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides thetaiotamomicrons, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides species, veillonella species, aerobic gram-positive bacilli, and escherichia coli). in five cases the  isolates were monobacteriae, and in the remaining four cases, cultures yielded more than one bacteria. the results of aspirate cultures led to changes in the initial antibiotic trial in seven of nine patients, and fever subsided thereafter. pneumothorax occurred in one cases as the sole complication. the pathogen causing obstructive pneumonitis is very heterogeneous, and polymicrobial infection is common.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == sepsis-induced apoptosis of the thymocytes in mice.
AB  == intraperitoneal injection of gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) induces thymic atrophy in mice. the thymus weight, cell number, and viability began to decrease at 3 h, and reached their lowest level at 72 h. the thymocyte death was associated with dna fragmentation of approximately 200 base pairs in ladder form. the kinetic study on histopathology revealed the process of thymocyte death and thymic atrophy. flow-cytometric analysis showed that cd4+cd8+ thymocytes decreased predominantly. lps caused thymocyte apoptosis, but only in lps-responder mice, unlike gram-negative bacteria that induced apoptosis in both lps-responder (c3h/hen) and lps-nonresponder (c3h/hej). gram-positive bacteria streptococcus pneumoniae also  caused apoptosis in lps-nonresponder (c3h/hej) and lps-responder mice (b6). the kinetics of serum tnf-alpha production after gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria injection was slightly different. e. coli induced serum tnf-alpha peak at 1 h in b6 mice, whereas s. pneumoniae induced a peak at 6 h in c3h/hej and at  9 h in b6 mice. similarly, s. pneumoniae induced thymocyte apoptosis around 9 to  12 h, which was 6 to 9 h later than that observed with e. coli in b6 mice. anti-tnf-alpha ab completely blocked the e. coli-induced thymocyte apoptosis, but was only partially inhibitory on the s. pneumoniae-induced thymocyte apoptosis. furthermore, thymocyte apoptosis induced by e. coli was inhibited by cycloheximide or actinomycin d. these data indicate that both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria could induce thymus atrophy via apoptosis, and that tnf-alpha is a common denominator released and might be responsible for the thymocyte apoptosis.

AB  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. the advantages of in vitro activity of fk037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (mic90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (h-mrsa), (3) a strong activity against enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (mic90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for escherichia coli,  0.1 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for haemophilus influenzae and proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis and moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for c. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant s. aureus (l-mrsa), enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for h-mrsa and serratia marcescens.  fk037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except mrsa, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except p. vulgaris and/or m. catarrhalis. the increase in mics of fk037 against 2 l-mrsa strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. fk037 was highly bactericidal against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa at the mic or higher. fk037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against h-mrsa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. against the other strains, fk037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa. transmission electron microscopic  studies revealed that fk037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in mrsa after 4 h incubation.

TI  == photochemical inactivation of pathogenic bacteria in human platelet concentrates.
AB  == platelet concentrates (pc) may be infrequently contaminated with low levels of bacteria that can cause septicemia and death in patients receiving transfusion therapy. we evaluated the efficacy of a photochemical decontamination (pcd) technique using 8-methoxypsoralen (8-mop) and long wavelength uv light (uva) to inactivate bacteria in standard therapeutic pc. twelve phylogenetically distinct  pathogenic bacteria, 5 gram-positive and 7 gram-negative organisms, were seeded into pc to a final challenge dose ranging from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. contaminated pc were treated with 8-mop (5 micrograms/ml) and 5 j/cm2 of uva, a pcd treatment regimen found to adequately preserve in vitro platelet function. greater than 10(5) cfu/ml of all 5 gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, and corynebacterium minutissimum) and 2 of the gram-negative (escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica) organisms were inactivated. the remaining 5 gram-negative organisms were more resistant, with less than 10(1) to 10(3.7) cfu/ml inactivated under these conditions. the inactivation efficiency for this resistant group of gram-negative organisms was improved when pc were resuspended in a synthetic storage medium with reduced plasma protein concentration (15%) and an increased 8-mop concentration (23.4 micrograms/ml). illumination with 3 j/cm2 of uva in this system inactivated greater than 10(5) cfu/ml of 4 resistant gram-negative organisms (salmonella choleraesuis, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and klebsiella pneumoniae) and 10(4.1) cfu/ml of the most resistant gram-negative organism (pseudomonas aeruginosa). this level of pcd treatment did not adversely affect in vitro platelet function. these results demonstrate that pcd using 8-mop (5 to 23.4 micrograms/ml) effectively inactivated high levels of pathogenic bacteria in pc with adequate preservation of in vitro platelet properties.

TI  == optimal times above mics of ceftibuten and cefaclor in experimental intra-abdominal infections.
AB  == the duration of time that serum drug levels remain above the mic (time above the  mic) for the pathogen has been shown to be the most significant parameter determining the efficacies of beta-lactam antibiotics. in the described study, we investigated the optimal time above the mic of ceftibuten and cefaclor using a nonneutropenic mouse model of intra-abdominal infections caused by staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and streptococcus pneumoniae. the abilities of the drugs to protect mice against the organisms were determined  in mouse protection tests, and the doses were fractionated to produce various dosing regimens with different times above the mic. all drug-organism combinations showed a significant correlation (r > 0.9) between drug efficacy and the time above the mic. also, with ceftibuten treatment, the different dosing regimens that produced equal times above the mic resulted in the same efficacy, whereas with cefaclor, an apparent dose-dependent effect was observed. these results showed that for a 100% recovery from k. pneumoniae and e. coli infections, the optimal times above the mic with ceftibuten treatment were 2.2 and 1.6 h, respectively. relatively high doses of both antibiotics were required  to ensure recovery from s. pneumoniae infections. in vitro time-kill studies demonstrated that cefaclor exhibits a marked inoculum effect against the pathogens, and there was a concentration-dependent killing at a large inoculum size. on the other hand, ceftibuten showed no inoculum effect. it is suggested that optimization of both dose and time above the mic appears to be necessary for the treatment of s. aureus infections with cefaclor, and this may apply to other  beta-lactams tht exhibit marked inoculum effects.

AB  == antimicrobial activity of cefuroxime axetil (cxm-ax) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains obtained mainly from outpatients of our center in a period from january to september of 1990 and 1993. minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined and the following results were  obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic80 of cxm were equal to or lower against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, peptostreptococcus spp., and propionibacterium acnes, except for streptococcus pneumoniae, mic80 which was slightly higher. 2. mic90 of comparator drugs reflected those of new resistant organisms recently appeared, such as benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephem-resistant e. coli and klebsiella spp., new quinolone-resistant h. influenzae and n. gonorrhoeae. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was detected also from specimens of community acquired infections. from the nature of mrsa detected in those situations mrsa appeared to present a continuing problem. 3. mic90 against strains obtained from  patients with community acquired infections was a good index of increases of multidrug-resistant organisms in the past. therefore, the determination of mic90  is important in examining changes with time of sensitivities or resistances of clinically isolated strains to antimicrobial drugs. 4. antimicrobial activities of cxm against recent clinical isolates showed the existence of problems as mentioned above. however, mic of cxm as well as those of comparator drugs indicated that antimicrobial activities of cxm against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., h. influenzae appeared to be relatively strong, and it is concluded that cefuroxime axetil still is one of the clinically useful oral antimicrobial drugs in the 1990's.

TI  == cefuroxime axetil.
AB  == cefuroxime is the first commercially-available second-generation cephalosporine to be widely used in therapy; it is a semi-synthetic cephalosporin obtained from  the 7-cephalosporanic acid nucleus of cephalosporin c. cefuroxime axetil is the acetoxyethyl ester of cefuroxime. the majority of micro-organisms associated with respiratory infections are highly sensitive to cefuroxime. these include haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and the  other streptococci (excluding group d streptococci), and moraxella catarrhalis. bacteria sensitive to cefuroxime include the enterobacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella and shigella and straphylococcus aureus (methicillin-sensitive strains). the pharmacokinetic studies show that the maximum plasma concentration of cefuroxime after oral administration of 250 mg and 500 mg of cefuroxime axetil after a meal are respectively 4.6 and 7.9 mg/l. the absolute bioavailability of tablets is 68% (extremes 63-73%) after oral administration of 500 mg cefuroxime axetil. the protein binding is 33+/-5.7%. tissue diffusion was studied in the interstitial fluid, the bronchial mucosa, the tonsils, and the bronchial secretions. cefuroxime axetil is available as capsule-shaped tablets containing 125, 250 or 500 mg. an oral suspension dosage form for paediatric purposes is also available  as granules in multidose bottles and sachets. constitution gives a suspension containing 125 mg or 250 mg cefuroxime (as cefuroxime axetil). cefuroxime axetil  is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible bacteria. indications include: lower respiratory tract infections (e.g., acute and chronic  bronchitis and pneumonia); upper respiratory tract infections (e.g., ear, nose and throat infections such as otitis media, sinusitis tonsillitis and pharyngitis); genito-urinary tract infections (e.g., pyelonephritis, cystitis and urethritis, gonorrhoea, acute uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis); and skin and soft tissue infections (e.g., furunculosis, pyoderma and impetigo). for most infections, a dose of 250 mg twice daily is appropriate.  in some urinary tract infections, 125 mg twice daily has been shown to be effective. if pneumonia is suspected or in more severe lower respiratory tract infection, doses of 500 mg bd should be used. uncomplicated gonorrhoea has been shown to respond to a single 1-g dose of cefuroxime axetil. adverse reactions to  cefuroxime have generally been mild and transient in nature (gastrointestinal disturbances, including diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting).

AB  == the in vitro activity of cefdinir, an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin was compared with that of cefixime, cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, oxacillin, ampicillin, vancomycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against 279 gram-positive and gram-negative recent  clinical isolates from adult and pediatric patients. cefdinir was the most active drug among the cephalosporins against oxacillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, escherichia coli and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90 0.015-2 mg/l). cefixime was the most active agent against hemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris (mic90 < 0.015-0.125 mg/l). the activity of cefpodoxime was better than that of cefixime against s. pneumoniae and oxacillin-sensitive staphylococci (mic90 0.25-8 vs. 0.5-32 mg/l), similar to  cefixime against s. pyogenes (mic90 0.06 mg/l) and not as good as cefixime against h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, klebsiella spp. and proteus spp. (mic90 <  0.015-0.25 vs. 0.125-0.5 mg/l). the activity of cefdinir was greater than that of the other cephalosporins against enterococcus faecalis (mic90 16-32 vs. > 64 mg/l). none of the cephalosporins were active against methicillin-resistant, coagulase-positive or -negative staphylococci or pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 >  64 mg/l). overall, the susceptibilities of adult and pediatric isolates were similar. kinetic kill curves demonstrated rapid and similar killing at 6 h by cefdinir, cefixime, cefpodoxime and ofloxacin. at 24 h at 1 x mic, the least regrowth was observed with cefdinir and cefpodoxime; at 2 x mic, suppression of growth was similar with all four drugs.

TI  == in-vitro evaluation of cefpodoxime.
AB  == in-vitro antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was evaluated against several microbial species by both conventional tests and additional parameters which take into consideration some of the conditions likely to be encountered in infected tissues. mics for 414 recent clinical isolates, including staphylococci, streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, several enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas hydrophila and campylobacter jejuni were determined. mic values overall were similar to those observed for strains from other geographical areas. inhibition of growth by cefpodoxime was virtually unaffected by the inoculum size, even using bacterial populations as large as 10(9) cfu of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, h. influenzae, beta-lactamase-negative m. catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. growth in the presence of human serum as the only source of nutrients did not significantly affect the inhibition exerted by cefpodoxime, even against large bacterial populations of s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae. for k. pneumoniae, e. coli, p. mirabilis and beta-lactamase-negative m. catarrhalis it was also found that sub-mic concentrations of cefpodoxime were still able to inhibit the majority of  cells in microbial populations as large as 10(9) cfu. evaluation of bactericidal  activity demonstrated that cefpodoxime concentrations comparable to those achievable in plasma or in the respiratory tract were able to kill rapidly large  bacterial populations of s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. the bactericidal activity was apparently lower against m. catarrhalis, h. influenzae, s. aureus, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae.

TI  == bacterial meningitis in children: etiology and clinical features, an 11-year review of 618 cases.
AB  == during the period january 1980 to december 1990 (11 years) a retrospective study  of patients with bacterial meningitis who were admitted to bangkok children's hospital was carried out. there were 618 patients with 77 cases (12.5%) occurring below the age of one month (neonatal meningitis), and 541 cases (87.5%) between one month to 15 years (childhood meningitis). pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common pathogenic organism (16.9%) in neonatal meningitis; other causative agents in this age group included klebsiella pneumoniae (13.0%), group b streptococcus (11.7%), escherichia coli and enterobacter sp (10.4% each). in childhood meningitis, haemophilus influenzae was the most common causative organism (42.3%), and followed by streptococcus pneumoniae (22.2%) and salmonella sp (12.4%). excluding a 13 year-old leukemic patient, salmonella meningitis occurred exclusively in infants, 87% of them were under six months, and 13% of them developed relapsing meningitis. presenting symptoms and signs on admission of neonatal meningitis such as fever (81.8%), convulsions (45.4%), neck stiffness (22.5%), bulging fontanelle (33.3%) and brudzinski sign (11.5%) were significantly less frequent than in the patients beyond the neonatal period (p <  0.05). the overall fatalities during 1980-1990 were 45.4% and 17.3% for neonatal  meningitis and childhood meningitis, respectively. the fatalities of the two age  groups declined significantly during 1987-1990 to 26.3% and 11.4% respectively.

TI  == the effects of intravesical pretreatment with pentosan polysulfate on the bacillus calmette-guerin induced immune reaction of the guinea pig.
AB  == immunotherapy with intravesical instillation of bacillus calmette-guerin (bcg) is an effective treatment for superficial bladder carcinoma. in the present study the bcg-induced immunological reaction in the guinea pig (ppd skin test, bladder  wall infiltrates and number of cells in the iliac lymph nodes) was investigated after intravesical pretreatment with pentosan polysulphate (pps), which modulated bcg attachment to the bladder wall. pentosan polysulfate is a molecule comparable to the naturally occurring glycosaminoglycans (gags) of the bladder mucosa. the data obtained after six weekly instillations of bcg-rivm (5 x 10(6) - 5 x 10(7) cfu) with or without preinstillation with pps (10 mg. in 1 ml. for 0.5 hour) suggested an elevation of the immunological reaction to intravesical bcg. a strong binding capacity of pps to the mammalian bladder wall was observed. in addition, and in contrast to bacteria commonly causing cystitis, a significant binding of pps to mycobacteria was found: 3.5, 3.6 and 3.1 micrograms./ml. dry weight of bcg connaught, rivm and pasteur, compared with 0.2, 0.3, 0.7 and 0.0 microgram./mg. dry weight of escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus. the results suggest that pps enhances the attachment of bcg to the bladder wall, resulting in an increased bcg-induced immunological reaction in the guinea pig. it may be speculated that pretreatment with pps may increase the efficacy of bcg therapy in man, especially in those patients not exhibiting an immunological reaction.

TI  == immune response in the lungs following oral immunization with bacterial lysates of respiratory pathogens.
AB  == we have investigated the local immune response of the balb/c mouse respiratory tract after oral immunization with a bacterial lysate of seven common respiratory pathogens. after two immunization on five consecutive days, we examined the immunoglobulin (immunoglobulin g [igg], igm, and iga) secretion rates of cells isolated from the lungs and compared them with those of spleen cells of orally immunized and nonimmunized animals by using a new test system based on time-resolved fluorescence. the procedure followed the principle of the classical elispot test with nitrocellulose-bottomed microtiter plates, but europium (eu3+)-linked streptavidin rather than enzyme-conjugated streptavidin was used, with the advantage of quantifying secreted immunoglobulins instead of detecting single antibody-secreting cells. lymphocytes isolated from the lungs of treated animals revealed significant increases in total and antigen-specific iga synthesis compared with the rates of the controls, whereas igg and igm production rates showed no remarkable differences. in addition, the sera of treated mice revealed higher antigen-specific iga titers but not increased igm and igg levels. we conclude that priming the gut-associated lymphoid tissue with bacterial antigens of pneumotropic microorganisms can elicit an enhanced iga response in a  distant mucosal effector site, such as the respiratory tract, according to the concept of a common mucosa-associated immune system.

AB  == bacterial endophthalmitis is generally considered to be the most severe and vision-threatening form of ocular infection. it may follow ocular surgery, trauma or microbial keratitis, -exogenous endophthalmitis-, or derived from a blood borne organism-endogenous endophthalmitis. the most common organisms causing exogenous endophthalmitis were gram positive bacteria, including coagulase negative staphylococcus, staphylococcus aureus. streptococcus pneumoniae and other streptococcal species. on the other hand, endogenous cases were mainly due  to gram negative bacteria, including klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli.  antimicrobial agents should be chosen based on the usual sensitivity of known or  suspected pathogens. aminoglycosides are almost universally used, combined with cephems and fluoroquinolone topically, subconjunctivally, parenterally and intravitreally. vancomycin is applied in mrsa infection. in severe cases, vitrectomy with intravitreal antibiotics, corticosteroid are performed most effectively.

TI  == microbiology and management of otitis media.
AB  == otitis media is a complex and multifactorial condition with four defined stages:  myringitis, acute otitis media, secretory (serous) otitis media and chronic otitis media. drugs utilized in its treatment are antihistamines, decongestants,  mucolytic agents, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, corticosteroids, vaccine therapy and antibiotics. the rationale for using antibiotics is that inflammation has been associated with the presence of virulent bacteria in all types of otitis media. in acute otitis media the major organisms, present are haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and moraxella catarrhalis. in chronic otitis media these organisms, plus staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and anaerobic bacteria are all prevalent. the microbiological flora of the middle ear in secretory otitis media is almost identical with that in acute otitis media. empirical therapy can  be given in most instances of acute and serous otitis media. however, in cases of failure, in the immunocompromised and in instances of chronic otitis media, establishing the individual microbiology of the inflamed middle ear is very helpful. the growing resistance of h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis to amoxycillin, due to beta-lactamase production, increases the risk of treatment failure of acute and serous otitis media. by adding a beta-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid) to amoxycillin, or using second-generation cephalosporins, clearance can be achieved. management of chronic otitis media requires surgical correction, drainage and coverage of anaerobic bacteria with agents such as amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, or clindamycin plus antimicrobials against other pathogens such as pseudomonas spp. where present.

TI  == antibacterial activity of cefepime in vitro.
AB  == cefepime is a new parenterally active fourth-generation cephalosporin which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. using the standard agar dilution method we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin against clinical isolates of escherichia coli (98 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (99 strains), acinetobacter spp. (24 strains), pseudomonas  aeruginosa (98 strains), haemophilus influenzae (108 strains), staphylococcus aureus (100 strains), enterococcus spp. (45 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (10 strains), streptococcus pyogenes (group a; 19 strains) and streptococcus agalactiae (group b; 36 strains). cefepime showed excellent activity against e. coli and k. pneumoniae, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 0.12 mg/l. the in vitro activity of cefepime was superior to or comparable to the third-generation  cephalosporins tested but was inferior to ciprofloxacin against acinetobacter spp. and p. aeruginosa. against h. influenzae, whether or not the strains produced beta-lactamase, its activity was similar to comparable drugs. all 84 isolates of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime whereas, like other cephalosporins, it had little activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. of the 45 enterococci isolates tested, 44.4% were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime. against streptococci, its activity was superior to any drug tested. this in vitro study indicates that cefepime has the  potential to be a valuable agent for the treatment of community- and hospital-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.

TI  == rabbit cap18 derived peptides inhibit gram negative and gram positive bacteria.
AB  == cap18 (cationic antimicrobial protein of 18 kda) was originally isolated from rabbit granulocytes using as an assay the agglutination of re-lipopolysaccharide  coated erythrocytes. the c-terminal 37 amino acids of cap18 comprise the lps-binding domain called rnip, reactive nitrogen inhibitory peptide. synthetic rnip has broad antimicrobial activity versus both gram positive [ic50 = 130-200 nm] and gram negative bacteria [ic50 = 20-100 nm). susceptible strains include staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and streptococcus pyogenes. antimicrobial activity is highly dependent upon peptide structure. although a 32  amino peptide resulting from truncation of five amino acids from the c terminus of rnip is highly active, other fragments of rnip including truncation of its n-terminus do not exhibit antimicrobial activity. unlike previously characterized antimicrobial peptides derived from granulocyte proteins rnip is active in serum. rnip or a derivative peptide may have therapeutic potential for bacterial sepsis.

AB  == eighteen suture abscesses that developed after penetrating keratoplasty in 15 patients were reviewed. the time from keratoplasty to the diagnosis of an abscess ranged from 1 to 53 months with a mean of 21.5 months. in 13 of the 18 cases, the patient was taking topical steroids at the time of diagnosis. all were culture-proven bacterial ulcers, except for one case that had a positive gram's stain, but no growth on culture. the organisms cultured were staphylococcus epidemidis (six eyes), streptococcus pneumoniae (five eyes), sta. aureus (four eyes), str. viridans (two eyes), klebsiella oxytoca (one eye), serratia marcescens (one eye), moraxella sp (one eye), and escherichia coli (one eye). the offending suture was removed in all cases, and the eyes were treated with topical fortified antibiotics (cefazolin and tobramycin). after treatment, 67% (12 of 18  eyes) had clear grafts, 17% (three of 18 eyes) were scarred, and 16% (three of 19 eyes) had failed grafts. intensive topical steroid therapy was used when a subsequent graft rejection developed. retained sutures following corneal transplants can result in sight-threatening infections and should be considered for removal as soon as the wound is well healed.

TI  == bacterial lysates and ribosomes as inducers of specific immune responses: a comparative study.
AB  == a bacterial lysate (om-85 bv), a preparation of purified bacterial ribosomes (d53) and a placebo were tested for ability to induce the local appearance of specific antibody-containing cells. the three compounds were given orally to 90 children who required tonsillectomy. surgery was carried out after 1 month of therapy. frozen-cut sections of each tonsil were tested in indirect immunofluorescence. cells containing antibodies directed to streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae or klebsiella pneumoniae were enumerated. lowest values were noted in the placebo group. slightly higher numbers were observed after treatment with om-85 bv, but significant increases were noted only for the elevated numbers of specific antibody-containing cells observed after d53 therapy. bacterial ribosomal preparations thus contribute efficient induction of specific local immune responses in man.

TI  == adverse perinatal outcome and resistant enterobacteriaceae after antibiotic usage for premature rupture of the membranes and group b streptococcus carriage.
AB  == objective: to report a case series of adverse perinatal outcomes associated with  resistant enterobacteriaceae after antibiotic usage for premature rupture of the  membranes (prom) and group b streptococcus. methods: maternal and neonatal records were reviewed of four cases in which adverse perinatal outcomes occurred  from resistant enterobacteriaceae after antibiotic usage for either prom or positive group b streptococcal cultures. information on clinical setting, antibiotic usage, maternal and neonatal complications, and maternal and neonatal  cultures was noted. results: all four cases were complicated by prom at 25-35 weeks' gestation. ampicillin or amoxicillin was used in several clinical settings, including therapeutically for the presence of group b streptococcus, presumptively for prom, and prophylactically pending the results of group b streptococcal cultures. clinical chorioamnionitis subsequently developed in all four cases, and in two cases the maternal course was prolonged and complicated by persistent fever and the need for therapy for pelvic vein thrombophlebitis. two neonates died from fulminant clinical sepsis. a third infant, one of a twin gestation, was stillborn, presumably because of sepsis. in three cases, neonatal  and placental cultures revealed escherichia coli resistant to ampicillin; in the  fourth case, klebsiella pneumoniae was identified, with only intermediate sensitivity to ampicillin. conclusion: resistant enterobacteriaceae associated with adverse perinatal outcomes may result from the use of antibiotics, such as ampicillin or amoxicillin, after prom. in deciding whether antibiotic therapy for prom or group b streptococcal prophylaxis is appropriate, the value of purported  benefits must be weighed against presumably infrequent but serious outcomes, including neonatal sepsis and death due to selection or overgrowth of resistant organisms.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == in order evaluate antimicrobial activities of cefodizime (cdzm), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic's) of cdzm and other control drugs were determined against various clinical isolates, that were sent to our center from nation-wide  medical institutions or were isolated and identified in our laboratory from various specimens of infected patients. the followings are a summary of the results: 1. bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to cephems including cdzm included streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter diversus, most of klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. some strains of klebsiella oxytoca were resistant to cephems increases in beta-lactams resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and cephem resistant escherichia coli seemed likely. among citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and providencia spp. belonging to a category of so-called "mildly toxic bacteria", high portions of the strains examined were resistant to cephems including cdzm and these strains were also resistant to new quinolones, thus they showed multiple drug resistance. 2. mic90's of cdzm against streptococcus spp., h. infleunzae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, e. coli, klebsiella spp. and p. mirabilis, frequently found in daily treatment of infections, were less than < or = 0.025 to 1.56 micrograms/ml. this indicates that cdzm would be expected to have enough antibiotic activity in infections caused by above mentioned bacteria. however, cautions are needed in the treatment of infections by beta-lactam resistant s. pneumoniae, cephem resistant e. coli and cephem resistant k. oxytoca with cdzm. 3. among the above mentioned "mildly toxic bacteria", many multiple drug resistant strains exist. therefore, we evaluated an usefulness of concomitant use of cdzm with aminoglycosides in the treatment of infections by these bacteria, using other reports which indicates the usefulness in vitro and in vivo. 4. antibacterial activities of cdzm we observed in this study seem to indicate that  cdzm concentrations in infected areas are maintained at above mic levels for relatively long periods of time.

TI  == cerebrospinal fluid osmolal changes in bacterial meningitis.
AB  == sixty children with acute bacterial meningitis (abm) were prospectively studied for their serum sodium values and cerebrospinal fluid (csf), serum and urinary osmolality. the results have been compared with 20 age and nutritionally matched  controls. even though mean serum osmolality (283.2 +/- 13.84 mosm/kg) and serum sodium levels (130.5 +/- 8.15 meq/l) were significantly lower in abm in comparison to controls (p < 0.05 and < 0.001, respectively), the overall mean csf osmolality in patients with abm (282.5 +/- 12.3 mosm/kg) was not significantly different as compared to controls (288.2 +/- 7.89 mosm/kg). as expected, cases of abm with syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (siadh) had  significantly lower csf osmolality (272 +/- 9.42 mosm/kg) as compared to those without siadh (288.5 +/- 9.34 mosm/kg) and controls (288.2 +/- 7.89 mosm/kg). however, our observations indicate that whereas the mean csf osmolality was lower than the serum osmolality in the control group as well as in abm without siadh, it was greater than serum osmolality in abm with siadh (p < 0.05). our results suggest that in the presence of siadh, hypo-osmolality of serum may eventually result in hypo-osmolality of csf, but the fall in csf osmolality is not of the same degree as that of serum. low csf osmolality was observed to be associated with an unfavorable prognosis (p < 0.05).

TI  == bacterial meningitis in infants and children in southern taiwan: emphasis on haemophilus influenzae type b infection.
AB  == during a four-year period from november 1988 to october 1992, 41 cases of bacterial meningitis with a positive cerebrospinal fluid (csf) culture and/or csf antigen test were collected at the national cheng kung university hospital. the ages of the subjects ranged from 32 days to 13 years, with a median of seven months. the male to female ratio was 2.4:1. the most common causative agent was haemophilus influenzae type b (hib, 29.3%), followed by group b beta-hemolytic streptococci (gbs, 24.4%), streptococcus pneumoniae (22.0%), escherichia coli (4.9%), neisseria meningitidis (4.9%), salmonella species (4.9%), klebsiella pneumoniae (4.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.6%), and viridans streptococci (2.6%). the onset of gbs meningitis was always prior to four months of age. of the 41 cases studied, 27 (65.9%) were aged from two months to five years; 12 (44.4%) of these had meningitis caused by hib. most of the cases (90.2%) had a fever as the first clinical manifestation. ampicillin combined with a third-generation cephalosporin was effective against most of the causative pathogens. the most frequently encountered short-term sequelae were seizures (64.7%), subdural effusion (55.9%) and ventriculomegaly (44.1%). observations on  long-term sequelae are ongoing. while the case-fatality rate was as high as 33.3% in s. pneumoniae, and 25% in hib-infected patients, the overall mortality rate was 17.1%. there is a need for greater emphasis on prevention through the use of  available vaccines, including the newly introduced conjugate vaccines against hib which are capable of eliciting immune responses in infants as young as two months.

TI  == the bacterial etiology of conjunctivitis in early infancy. eye prophylaxis study  group.
AB  == the authors conducted this study to determine the etiologic agents of conjunctivitis in early infancy. from 1985 to 1990, 630 infants enrolled in a randomized, controlled, double-masked study of eye prophylaxis were observed for  60 days after delivery for signs of conjunctivitis. the following isolates were categorized as pathogens: haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria cinerea, klebsiella pneumoniae, and chlamydia trachomatis. using conditional logistic regression for analysis of 97 infant pairs, the authors identified isolates categorized as pathogens almost exclusively among cases (odds ratio (or) = 18.0, 95% confidence interval (ci) 2.3-128). among the microorganisms which have not usually been regarded as pathogens in the etiology  of infant conjunctivitis, streptococcus mitis was the only microorganism associated with an increased risk of conjunctivitis (or = 5.3, 95% ci 1.8-15.0).  the findings concerning the species of bacteria most often associated with conjunctivitis, as well as the finding that method of delivery is unimportant, suggest that bacteria were transmitted to the infants' eyes after birth and not from the birth canal.

TI  == bronchointerstitial pneumonia and respiratory distress in young horses: clinical, clinicopathologic, radiographic, and pathological findings in 23 cases (1984-1989).
AB  == twenty-three foals, between 1 and 7 months old, with signs of acute respiratory distress, were examined at the veterinary medical teaching hospital (vmth), university of california, davis, between 1984 and 1989. characteristic features included sudden onset of severe respiratory distress and tachypnea, cyanosis unresponsive to nasal oxygen, pyrexia, hypoxemia, hypercapneic respiratory acidosis, poor response to treatment, and histopathologic lesions of bronchiolitis and bronchointerstitial pneumonia. seven of the 23 foals were normal before the onset of respiratory distress, 3 foals were found dead, and 13  foals were being treated for respiratory tract infections at the time of presentation. laboratory data obtained for 13 horses showed increased plasma fibrinogen concentration (630.7 +/- 193 mg/dl), leukocytosis (18,607 +/- 7,784/microl), and neutrophilia (13,737 +/- 8,211/microl). thoracic radiographs showed a diffuse increase in interstitial and bronchointerstitial pulmonary opacity and, in 5 foals, an alveolar pulmonary pattern of increased density was also seen. in 3 foals heavy interstitial infiltration proceeded to a coalescing nodular radiographic appearance. microbiological culture of tracheobronchial aspirates (tba) from 9 foals yielded bacterial growth, but no one bacterial species was consistently isolated. microbiological culture of postmortem specimens of the lung from 6 foals yielded growth of bacteria that included escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, rhodococcus equi, or beta-hemolytic streptococcus spp. tracheobronchial aspirates from 4 foals and lung samples collected from a further 4 foals at necropsy yielded no bacterial growth. cultures were not taken from two foals premortem or  postmortem. virologic examination of tba, lung tissue, or pooled organ tissue from 12 foals was negative. viral culture of tba from 1 foal showed cytopathic effects and positive immunofluorescence for equine herpes virus type ii (ehv-ii). in addition to the 3 foals that were found dead, 11 foals died or were euthanatized. pathologic lesions were limited to the lungs in 50% of the foals; the remainder also had bowel lesions suggestive of hypoxic injury. the predominant histopathologic pulmonary lesions included bronchiolitis, bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial hyperplasia, and necrosis. many bronchioles were filled with mucoid and fibrinocellular exudate. the peribronchiolar interstitium and adjacent alveolar spaces were also infiltrated with inflammatory cells and contained proteinaceous edema fluid. type ii cell hyperplasia and hyaline membrane formation were observed in the majority of foals and in 2 foals alveolar multinucleate giant cells were also present.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [the antimicrobial activity of cefteram against recently clinically detected and  isolated strains].
AB  == in order to examine antibiotic activities of cefteram (cftm), its minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic's) and those of other cephem drugs were determined against clinically isolated strains received from july 1990 to june 1991 and from july 1992 to february 1993 from medical facilities throughout the country and against clinically isolated strains detected in our laboratory in samples from patients with various infectious diseases. the obtained results are summarized below. 1. no cftm-resistant strains were found among beta-streptococci, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae or even when found, they were present in extremely low proportions. 2. it appeared that streptococcus pneumoniae insensitive or resistant to beta-lactams, as well as cephems-resistant strains of escherichia coli were increasing. the former included benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae  (pisp) of pcg-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), and the presence of the latter suggests the possibility of the existence of "extended broad-spectrum beta-lactamase" producing strains. the mic's of beta-lactams against the above pisp or prsp, and against cephems-resistant e. coli tended to be high, but those  of cftm were relatively low (in most cases). 3. proportions of strains resistant  to cephems, including cftm among citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and providencia rettgeri were  high, and in addition, the existence of these cephem resistant species suggests an increase in multiple drug resistant strains that show resistance to new quinolone drugs. 4. as mentioned above, cftm is by no means a perfect drug or utility drug and its antimicrobial activities do not cover some recent isolates with multiple drug resistance. except problems encountered with so-called "attenuated" strains of bacteria, increases in resistance can only be observed at a level of mic90's, and as far as mic80's are concerned, cftm still is as active  as before and may be used in the treatment of most infections we encounter in normal medical practices.

AB  == a prospective study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of ampicillin as an initial therapy in 60 adult patients with community acquired pneumonia. bacteriological etiology was obtained only in 24 (40pc) patients by microscopic examination, culture and antigen detection. streptococcus pneumoniae was the leading causative agent identified in 15 cases. other etiologies were klebsiella  pneumoniae (3), streptococcus pyogenes (2) staphylococcus aureus (2), haemophilus influenzae (1) and moraxella catarrhails (1). patients were started on ampicillin one gram twice daily, empirically, and treated for 10 days. there were 52(86.7pc) patients cured, two(3.3pc) patients improved and six (10pc) were therapeutic failures. the causative agents in patients with failures were: klebsiella pneumoniae (1), staphylococcus aureus (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (1) and unknown in three cases. only six of 60 patients still febrile after three days were switched to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid or cefaclor according to culture results and susceptibilities or to roxythromycin because no organisms were isolated. side effects were observed in only one (1.7pc) patient who developed a  mild skin rash. due to its low cost and its high efficacy, ampicillin still appears to be the drug of choice in adult community acquired pneumonia in our region.

AB  == to examine changing trends in the microbial etiology of nosocomial urinary tract  infections, we reviewed culture data from a surveillance database for the calendar years 1982 to 1991. the overall rates of nosocomial urinary tract infections have increased significantly during the last decade from 2.63 per 1,000 patient-days to 4.35 per 1,000 patient-days (p = 0.0023). for specific isolates the rates of yeasts, klebsiella pneumoniae and group b streptococcus have increased significantly during the last decade. the rates of escherichia coli, proteus species and pseudomonas species have all decreased. analysis of these secular trends can provide important information relating to the etiology of nosocomial urinary tract infections. it is likely that antibiotic "pressure" has influenced the microbiology of infections and that altered case-mix would explain much of the increase in rates. however, the multiple reasons for these secular trends and their precise contributions to them are unknown.

AB  == a viable counting technique was used to determine the post-antibiotic effect (pae) of ofloxacin against four bacterial species, treated with either once of four times the minimum inhibitory concentration for 1 or 3 h. similar to the results obtained previously with ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin gave pae values with escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes. cell division of klebsiella pneumoniae was inhibited on removal of ofloxacin, but no clear pae was demonstrated with this species because once replication recommenced, the mean generation times of drug-treated cultures were much shorter than those of untreated controls. therefore, although the results obtained with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin imply a consistency of pae for 4-quinolones within a  species, the response to dna damage induced by 4-quinolones is multifaceted and species dependent. 4-quinolones inhibit both dna replication and cell division, whilst at the same time stimulating dna repair pathways. thus, in some cases paes result from an increased post-treatment lag phase which may be followed by nearly normal multiplication, whereas in other cases a long lag may be followed by abnormally rapid cell division, with the generation times of treated cultures being shorter than those of corresponding drug-free controls. the pae of a drug-induced lag may thus be masked by rapid cell division once growth resumes.

AB  == in a retrospective study at son dureta hospital (palma de mallorca, mallorca, spain) of the period 1977-1991, 334 cases of culture-proven sepsis and/or meningitis in neonates born at the facility were identified. overall, there was an incidence rate of 4.9 cases per 1,000 live births. the case-fatality rate was  7.5%. infection was more frequent in infants of low birth weight, with the exception of infants with meningitis and infections due to group b streptococcus  and listeria species. the patterns of predominance among bacterial pathogens that were isolated changed during the period studied. from 1977 to 1984, klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequent such isolate, but this frequency declined in the following years. group b streptococcus organisms and staphylococcus epidermidis replaced k. pneumoniae as the predominant pathogens in early- and staphylococcus  epidermidis replaced k. pneumoniae as the predominant pathogens in early- and late-onset infections, respectively. the frequency with which other pathogens were isolated did not vary significantly during the study period. invasive infection caused by candida organisms was found in two patients. the incidence of infection due to group b streptococci has increased in the last few years (to 2.4 cases per 1,000 live births in 1991) and has become a significant problem that requires a thorough epidemiological evaluation.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of empyema. a retrospective review in two military hospitals.
AB  == the microbiology and clinical features of empyema were studied retrospectively in 197 patients whose specimens yielded bacterial growth after inoculation for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. three hundred forty-three organisms (216 aerobic  or facultative and 127 anaerobic organisms) were isolated. aerobic bacteria were  isolated in 127 (64 percent) patients, anaerobic bacteria in 25 (13 percent), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 45 (23 percent). the predominant aerobic  or facultative organisms were streptococcus pneumoniae (70 isolates), staphylococcus aureus (58), escherichia coli (17), klebsiella pneumoniae (16), and haemophilus influenzae (12). the predominant anaerobes were pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas species (24), bacteroides fragilis group (22), anaerobic cocci (36), and fusobacterium species (20). beta-lactamase-producing organisms were recovered in 49 (38 percent) of 128 tested specimens. these included all 42 tested s aureus and 15 b fragilis group, 4 of 9 k pneumoniae, 3 of 9 h influenzae, 3 of 8 pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas species, and 2 of 6 e coli. most patients from whom s pneumoniae and h influenzae were recovered had pneumonia, and most patients with s aureus had pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, and lung abscesses. the recovery of anaerobic bacteria was mostly associated with the concomitant diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia, and lung, subdiaphragmatic, dental, and oropharyngeal abscesses. these data highlight the importance of anaerobic bacteria in selected cases of empyema.

TI  == isolation, characterization and sequence analysis of the scrk gene encoding fructokinase of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == a gene encoding an atp-dependent fructokinase from streptococcus mutans gs-5 was  identified within a 2 kb dna fragment immediately downstream from the scra gene.  the gene cloned in escherichia coli also expressed mannokinase activity. insertional inactivation of this gene in s. mutans markedly decreased both fructokinase and mannokinase activities. nucleotide sequence analysis of the 2 kb fragment revealed an orf starting 199 bp downstream from the scra gene, preceded  by potential ribosome-binding (shine-dalgarno) and promoter-like sequences. this  orf specified a putative protein of 293 amino acids with a calculated m(r) of 31,681. the deduced amino acid sequence of the fructokinase gene, scrk, from s. mutans exhibited no significant similarity to fructokinase genes from klebsiella  pneumoniae, e. coli plasmid pur400 or vibrio alginolyticus, but was similar to a  comparable gene from zymomonas mobilis.

TI  == structure of the maltodextrin-uptake locus of streptococcus pneumoniae. correlation to the escherichia coli maltose regulon.
AB  == the mechanism of induction of the maltose/maltodextrin regulon of the gram-positive bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae seems to be different to the positively controlled maltose regulons of the enteric bacteria escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella typhimurium. in this work, we report on the  structure of the s. pneumoniae genes involved in maltodextrin uptake malx, malc and mald. comparisons of the amino acid sequences encoded by these genes indicate that they are homologous to the e. coli male periplasmic maltose binding protein  and the two maltose permeases malg and malf. the analysis of transcription start  points indicates that malxcd could be transcribed from a single consensus promoter sequence. northern analysis of the mrna molecules pertaining to this region reveals that the transcript encompassing all these three genes is apparently cleaved at a large putative mrna secondary structure, yielding two mrna molecules. the smaller of these molecules would include only the malx gene while a larger fragment spans through malc and mald. the processing of mrna has not been reported in the gram-negative maltose regulons, and may suggest either a less evolved or a divergent system for the control of gene expression of this regulon in s. pneumoniae.

TI  == bacterial aetiology of acute lower respiratory infections in pre-school nigerian  children and comparative predictive features of bacteraemic and non-bacteraemic illnesses.
AB  == in a 9-month surveillance of the microbial agents causing acute lower respiratory infections (alri) in hospitalized preschool nigerian children, 24 bacterial isolates were made from 22 (33 per cent) out of 66 blood cultures, including seven (70 per cent) of the 10 cultures from subjects with pleural effusion. of the 24 positive isolates, staphylococcus aureus accounted for 14 (58 per cent), klebsiella pneumoniae for four (17 per cent), streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus albus for two (8 per cent) each, and haemophilus influenzae for only one case. seven subjects had a mixed aetiology, comprising one bacteraemic case with measles and six with concomitant viral identifications. sixteen cases,  10 (63 per cent) of whom were malnourished, had two or more pathogens, including  10 with multiple viruses. bacterial isolates from the throat, were not significantly predictive of the alri aetiology. overt malnutrition, empyema, and  anaemia, were significantly commoner in bacteraemic cases (p < 0.03, 0.01, and 0.05), while rhinorrhoea and crepitations were each associated with the non-bacteraemic ones. (p = 0.05 and < 0.05). a similar association was shown between rhinorrhoea, wheezing/rhonchi and the mixed aetiological group (p < 0.05  and 0.05, respectively). the case-fatality in bacteraemic subjects, was 9 per cent and was 2.1 times higher than that for non-bacteraemic cases, in whom a shorter mean duration of admission was recorded. in developing countries, the need for periodic local surveillance of alri pathogens, as a prerequisite for evolving rational antimicrobial policies, is emphasized. our findings underscore  the predictive importance of malnutrition as a risk-factor of severe bacteraemic  alri, frequently associated with multiple pathogens. the relative usefulness of blood culture in identifying bacterial agents of alri is discussed.

AB  == immunological characterization of various pseudomonas pseudomallei preparations was carried out by sds-page and western blot using sera from infected humans and  from patients with other bacterial infections. somatic (som) and partially purified cell extracts (pce) gave more complex sds-page patterns: m(r) ranged from 86 to 12.7 and 48 to 10 kda, respectively. the culture-filtrated antigens (cf) from 3 different kinds of synthetic media consisted of fairly simple profiles with common bands m(r) of 40, 26 and 16 kda. pce and cf reacted specifically with infected human sera; som did not. the components with m(r) of 40 kda in cf reacted consistently with all infected sera but failed to react with sera infected with escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and p. stutzeri. this peptide was demonstrated to be a major component in cf thus suggesting its potential for development of immunodiagnostic methods for melioidosis.

AB  == fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, is an oxime-type cephem antibiotic with a  1-hydroxyethyl-5-amino-pyrazole moiety at the 3 position. fk037 was evaluated for antimicrobial activity in vitro and in vivo. in vitro, fk037 was twofold or more  active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic for 90% of the strains [mic90] = 32 micrograms/ml), members of the family enterobacteriaceae (mic90 < or = 2 micrograms/ml), group a  streptococci (mic90 = 0.015 microgram/ml), and methicillin-sensitive or -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic90 = 2 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively). in addition, the activity of fk037 was equal to or greater than that of ceftazidime, cefotaxime, or ceftriaxone against streptococcus pneumoniae  (mic90 = 0.12 microgram/ml) and methicillin-sensitive or -resistant staphylococcus aureus (mic90 = 2 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively). fk037 was more active in vitro than cefepime (two- to fourfold) and cefpirome (twofold) against s. aureus. in murine systemic infection models, fk037 showed potent activity against p. aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant s. aureus. fk037 was also efficacious in a mouse model of pyelonephritis caused by s. aureus or klebsiella pneumoniae and in a mouse model  of pneumococcal pneumonia caused by s. pneumoniae. additional studies on this compound to assess its potential clinical utility are warranted.

TI  == immunodiagnosis of group-a streptococci by latex agglutination assays with monoclonal or monospecific polyvalent antibodies.
AB  == seven clones of murine monoclonal antibodies specific for group-a streptococci were generated. all of them were of igm isotypes and recognized trypsinized as well as nontrypsinized group-a streptococci and polysaccharide. these were devoid of reactivity with streptococci-b, -c, -g and staphylococcus aureus. polyclonal antibodies against group-a polysaccharide (aps) were also raised in rabbits by linking aps to bovine serum albumin, and rendered monospecific by adsorption. latex agglutination assays were developed employing both types of antibodies. the assay employing monospecific polyvalent antibodies had a sensitivity of 12.5 ng aps/ml as compared to 1 microgram aps/ml for latex sensitized with monoclonal antibodies. both assays were specific, as no agglutination was observed with polysaccharides obtained from streptococci-b, -c, -g, staph. aureus, cornybacterium diptheriae, candida albicans, candida spp., morexella catarrhalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, strep. pneumoniae. salmonella typhi and s. paratyphi a and b. throat  swabs from children obtained in duplicate, when tested for the presence of streptococci-a, showed a good correlation of the results obtained by latex agglutination assay with the microbial culture test and serogrouping.

TI  == the microbiology of acute and chronic sinusitis and otitis media:a review.
AB  == there exists no real controversy about the role of aerobic bacteria in acute sinusitis and in acute otitis media. the "infernal trio" streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis are by far the most  common pathogens in these acute infections. on the contrary, there is still much  debate about the normal flora of the paranasal sinuses and the middle ear, although there are some reports of the presence of anaerobes and aerobes in the majority of the normal paranasal sinuses. in chronic sinusitis bacteriological cultures show a greater variation than those in acute sinusitis. nonetheless, it  is demonstrated in most studies that besides the "infernal trio" additional bacteria are present, including anaerobes and gram negative bacteria. in otitis media with effusion (ome) we find the same bacteria as in acute otitis media (aom) and a pathologic flora in the nasopharynx seems to be important for both aom and ome. in chronic otitis cultures are nearly always positive and reveal pseudomonas species, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, proteus species and anaerobes.

AB  == placentas from aborted, stillborn, and premature foals were examined during the 1988 and 1989 foaling seasons, and 236 of 954 (24.7%) had placentitis. microorganisms associated with placentitis were isolated or demonstrated from 162 of 236 (68.6%) placentitis cases. leptospira spp. and a nocardioform actinomycete were 2 important, newly emerging bacteria associated with equine placentitis. major pathogens identified in decreasing order were streptococcus zooepidemicus,  leptospira spp., escherichia coli, a nocardioform actinomycete, fungi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus equisimilis, enterobacter agglomerans, klebsiella pneumoniae, and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus. pathogens were not recovered in 64 cases (27.1%) and overgrowth by saprophytic bacteria was recorded in 10 cases (4.2%). twenty-seven cases (16.6%) had mixed bacterial growth and 93  cases (57.4%) had bacteria cultured from both placenta and fetal organs. the majority of the placentitis cases caused by bacteria, with the exception of leptospira spp. and the nocardioform actinomycete, occurred in 2 forms. one was acute, focal or diffuse; had an infiltration of neutrophils in the intervillous spaces or necrosis of chorionic villi; was associated with bacteremia; and frequently occurred in the placenta from fetuses expelled before or at midgestation. the other was observed from foals expelled at late gestation, was mostly chronic and focal or focally extensive, and occurred mostly at the cervical star area. chronic placentitis was characterized by the presence of 1 or a combination of the following lesions: necrosis of chorionic villi, presence of  eosinophilic amorphous material on the chorion, and infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells in the intervillous spaces, villous stroma, chorionic stroma,  vascular layer, and allantois.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == comparison of empiric aztreonam and aminoglycoside regimens in the treatment of serious gram-negative lower respiratory infections.
AB  == an open-label, controlled, randomized study was performed to assess the efficacy  and safety of combination regimens using either aztreonam or an aminoglycoside control regimen as empiric therapy for suspected aerobic gram-negative bacillary  pneumonia or purulent bronchitis. eighty-four patients, 42 in each arm of the study, were randomly assigned to one of two treatment regimens. the combination aztreonam regimen included aztreonam, 2 gm every 8 hours (q8h), plus either clindamycin, 600 to 900 mg q8h, or nafcillin, 1.5 gm to 2 gm every 6 hours (q6h). the control regimen was one of the following depending on the combination therapy that was designated standard at each of the three study institutions: amikacin, 5 mg/kg q8h, plus cefazolin, 1 gm q8h; amikacin, 500 mg every 12 hours plus mezlocillin, 4 gm q6h; or kinetically dosed tobramycin plus ticarcillin, 3 gm to  4 gm q4h. the two groups were well matched in terms of demographics and clinical  characteristics. among the 84 patients, organisms from the enterobacteriaceae family accounted for the largest proportion of isolates (44%) including escherichia coli (13%), klebsiella species (14%), and serratia species (9%). other commonly identified organisms were pseudomonas aeruginosa (19%), haemophilus influenzae (15%), streptococcus pneumoniae (12%), and staphylococcus  aureus (8%). results of this trial included clinical response rates of 83% in both groups (p = 0.951) and a microbiologic cure rate of 75% in the aztreonam group and 63% in the control group (p = 0.291). in the 59 patients with documented aerobic gram-negative pneumonia, microbiologic eradication rates were  72% in the aztreonam group versus 57% in the control group (p = 0.359). duration  of treatment tended to be shorter in the aztreonam group than in the control group, with a median 10 days of therapy versus 12 days of therapy (p = 0.095), respectively. in addition, the percentage of patients requiring nonstudy antimicrobial agents tended to be lower in the aztreonam group than the control group, involving 21% of patients in the aztreonam group compared with 36% of patients in the control group (p = 0.086). all regimens were well tolerated, and  no patient was withdrawn because of adverse reactions to the study medications. two patients, both in the control group, required dose reduction, which was necessitated by possible aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity. this trial shows  that aztreonam is an effective agent with an excellent safety profile when used in combination regimens for the empiric treatment of pneumonia. a well-controlled trial is needed to verify the trend toward shorter hospital stays and a reduced need for additional antimicrobial agents seen with the aztreonam regimen when compared with those receiving aminoglycoside-combination regimens.

AB  == macrolide and beta-lactam antimicrobial agents are frequently used for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections and skin or skin structure infections. to evaluate the relative in vitro activity of these antimicrobial drugs against organisms commonly involved in these infections, we tested clarithromycin, erythromycin, cefprozil, cefuroxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and doxycycline against 174 gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae. manual broth microdilution susceptibility testing was used with a standard inoculum of 5 x 10(4) colony-forming units/well at ph of 7.2. clarithromycin was the most active agent against streptococci. methicillin-susceptible s aureus exhibited resistance to both clarithromycin and  erythromycin, but was susceptible to cefprozil, cefuroxime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and doxycycline. cefprozil was at least as active as cefuroxime, cefaclor, and cephalexin against all organisms tested, but was fourfold less active than doxycycline against e coli and 16-fold less active than clarithromycin versus s pneumoniae. the gram-negative isolates tested showed resistance to clarithromycin and erythromycin; however, cefprozil was as active as amoxicillin/clavulanate against k pneumoniae and e coli. these results demonstrate that clarithromycin provides superior in vitro activity against common streptococci, while cefprozil, cefuroxime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and doxycycline provide greater activity against methicillin-susceptible s aureus, k  pneumoniae, and e coli. prospective clinical trials are needed to determine the clinical significance of these findings.

TI  == treatment recommendations for respiratory tract infections associated with aging.
AB  == age-related changes, for example reduced elasticity and earlier airways collapse, predispose the elderly to respiratory infection. other factors such as a lifetime of smoking, the use of hypnotics, or the development of stroke also predispose. pneumonia becomes increasingly common with advancing age, and both morbidity and  mortality increase with associated disease burden. diagnosis of pneumonia may be  more difficult in the aged because of physiological changes. however, careful physical examination with accurate, regular recording of body temperature will usually reveal the characteristic features of pneumonia, which should be confirmed by chest radiograph. in the frail elderly, the onset of impaired function, such as confusion, immobility, falling or incontinence, should raise suspicion of infection. pneumonia is classified as community-acquired, nursing home-acquired or nosocomial, which helps in the empirical choice of antibiotics.  streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common organism in the community, then haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis. gram-negative organisms like  klebsiella and escherichia coli are more common in nosocomial infections. nursing home patients with pneumonia tend to be more frail than those in the community. treatment is directed at eradication of the organism with the appropriate antibiotic, maintaining hydration and oxygenation, as well as managing impaired mobility, faecal loading, urinary incontinence and confusion. influenza vaccination is strongly recommended for the frail elderly. tuberculosis remains an important diagnosis in the frail elderly and should always be considered, especially in patients with respiratory infection who fail to respond to conventional therapy.

TI  == contributions of post-antibiotic lag and repair-recovery to the post-antibiotic effects of ciprofloxacin on escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == a viable counting technique was used to determine the post-antibiotic effect (pae) of ciprofloxacin against four bacterial species, treated with either one or four times the minimum inhibitory concentration for 1 or 3 h. pae were demonstrated with escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes after exposure to either concentration for both times. no clear pae was  demonstrated for klebsiella pneumoniae after any treatment. in some cases, pae was due to an increased post-treatment lag phase, which was followed by nearly normal multiplication, whereas in other cases a long lag was followed by abnormally rapid cell division, with the generation times of treated cultures being much less than those of the corresponding drug-free controls. this is evidence of recovery of cells that have completed dna repair. s. aureus, e. coli  and k. pneumoniae all exhibited evidence of this type of repair even though k. pneumoniae gave no significant pae. however, the post-treatment generation times  of s. pyogenes, which produced the greatest pae, gave no evidence of such repair. it is concluded that paes may result from a variety of factors.

TI  == in vivo antibacterial activity of fk037, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  == fk037 has potent therapeutic activity against lethal systemic infections and experimental local infections due to a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria such as staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice. in murine systemic infections, fk037 was the most effective of the cephalosporins and imipenem tested against highly methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (h-mrsa). it was more effective than ceftazidime against selected strains of s. aureus and enterobacteriaceae, except serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa against which fk037 was as effective as ceftazidime and was as effective as cefpirome against all organisms tested, except mrsa and p. aeruginosa against which fk037 was more  effective than cefpirome. these results correlated well with its in vitro activity. in murine local infections, with few exceptions, fk037 was more effective than ceftazidime and cefpirome against klebsiella pneumonia in ed50 values and against methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa) subcutaneous abscess, pyelonephritis with staphylococcus epidermidis, e. coli and p. aeruginosa, intrauterine infections with s. aureus and e. coli in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the abscess, kidneys and uterus. it is noteworthy that the therapeutic effects of fk037 were more potent than had been anticipated from its  in vitro activity against local infections with staphylococci and p. aeruginosa when compared with ceftazidime or cefpirome. in addition, the therapeutic effects of fk037 were equipotent or superior to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime against pneumonia due to mssa, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs in mice using an in vivo pharmacokinetic model simulating human plasma concentrations after drip infusion of usual clinical doses (0.25 to 1.0 g for mssa, 0.063 to 0.125 g for k. pneumoniae and 1.0 to 2.0 g for p. aeruginosa). fk037 induced an in vivo post-antibiotic effect  (pae) of 3.4 hours against a thigh infection with mssa in neutropenic mice. these results strongly suggest that it has potential for clinical use against various infections due to bacteria which include staphylococci and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
AB  == an agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, shigella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, and haemophilus influenzae with an mic90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, and legionella pneumophila with an mic of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. ciprofloxacin inhibited staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. norfloxacin  and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (mic90) against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and some other gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. the results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against gram-negative and gram-positive species.

TI  == importance of beta-lactamase stability in treating today's respiratory tract infections.
AB  == in respiratory tract infections streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis,  haemophilus influenzae and klebsiella spp. are the most frequently encountered bacterial pathogens. resistance of clinical s. pneumoniae isolates is known to be independent of beta-lactamase production, whereas resistance of the other species mentioned is due to beta-lactamase production. with respect to m. catarrhalis the first beta-lactamase-producing (bla+) isolate was detected in clinical specimens  in 1976 and now, 70-90% of all clinical isolates are bla+. the enzymes bro-1 and  bro-2 are transposon-mediated thus explaining their rapid spread; they hydrolyze  penicillin compounds very rapidly and, to a lesser extent, the older cephalosporins. resistance in clinical h. influenzae isolates is mainly due to the prevalence of the most widespread transposon-mediated beta-lactamase, tem-1,  which has a substrate profile resembling that of the bro enzymes. bla+ h. influenzae isolates make up to 6% of the total in northern europe, in southern europe up to 55% and in many african countries more than 80%. more than 95% of klebsiella spp. isolates possess a chromosomally encoded penicillinase and to a varying extent a plasmid-mediated enzyme in addition. recently, reports from several countries have pointed to the clinical relevance of 'extended-spectrum enzymes' derived by point mutation from the 'classical' tem-1 or tem-2 enzymes. these new enzymes (tem-3 to tem-21) exhibit a broadened substrate profile, inactivating even the oxyiminocephalosporins. the most stable compounds are ceftibuten and cefetamet. with respect to the future, these enzymes may spread between species due to their location on transposons.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == multicomponent vaccine vp-4, prepared from streptococcus, klebsiella, proteus and escherichia coli antigens, was tested for protective activity by oral administration to mice with experimental klebsiella, proteus and s. pneumoniae infections. vaccine vp-4, when introduced orally (in 2-3 administrations of 2 mg), was found to produce a protective effect with respect to k. pneumoniae (the  effectiveness index was equal to 5.7 and 4.3). with respect to p. vulgaris, the effectiveness index was 2.7 (immunization was made in two oral administrations of 2 mg); in pneumococcal infection preliminary oral immunization with vaccine vp-4  in two administrations in a dose of 2-4 mg produced high protective effect. thus, immunization with vaccine vp-4, introduced orally in comparatively small doses, proved to be effective in animal models used in the experiment.

TI  == lomefloxacin versus amoxicillin in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: results of multinational studies.
AB  == the results of two large, multicenter studies comparing the safety and efficacy of lomefloxacin (400 mg administered orally once daily) and amoxicillin (500 mg administered orally three times daily) in adult patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis caused predominantly by gram-negative pathogens have been combined. the studies were both randomized and blinded. one study enrolled 127 patients in 12 centers in belgium; the second enrolled 510 patients in 52 centers in ten countries. the protocols were essentially identical, whicl allowed data to be pooled. a total of 253 lomefloxacin-treated patients and 254 amoxicillin-treated patients were considered evaluable. both groups were well matched in terms of age, gender, and severity of presenting signs and symptoms. the most common pathogens in both treatment groups were haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, and klebsiella pneumoniae. two to four days after the conclusion of  treatment, bacterial eradication rates were 85.4% for lomefloxacin-treated patients and 75.2% for patients receiving amoxicillin (p = 0.004). the clinical success rate (total of evaluable patients either cured or improved) 2-4 days after the conclusion of treatment for the lomefloxacin group was 90.9%, and for amoxicillin was 82.3% (p = 0.005). the incidence of adverse events was similar in both treatment groups, and no interactions were noted in those patients in both groups who received concomitant theophylline. in these studies, lomefloxacin administered once daily was superior to amoxicillin given three times daily to patients with acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis caused predominantly by gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin b, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the n-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == a physiologically diverse range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin b, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. the list of susceptible organisms includes escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, corynebacterium diphtheriae, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens.  concentrations of lactoferricin b required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and  the culture medium used. the peptide showed activity against e. coli o111 over the range of ph 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of na+, k+, mg2+ or ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. lactoferricin  b was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. pseudomonas fluorescens, enterococcus faecalis and bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.

TI  == enap-2, a novel cysteine-rich bactericidal peptide from equine leukocytes.
AB  == we purified a novel cysteine-rich antibiotic peptide, enap-2 (m(r), approximately 6,500), from acid extracts of equine neutrophils by sequential gel filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and determined its partial  n-terminal amino acid sequence. although its cysteine motif distinguished enap-2  from all other currently known endogenous antibiotic peptides, including defensins and granulins, it showed substantial sequence similarity to wdnm1, a putative member of the four-disulfide-core protein family that also includes animal and human antiproteases, snake venom neurotoxins, and rat and mouse whey proteins. the antibacterial properties of enap-2 were tested against several equine uterine pathogens, namely, streptococcus zooepidemicus, escherichia coli,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae. killing of s. zooepidemicus was very efficient, as evidenced by a 94% decrease in numbers of cfu per milliliter after exposure to 100 micrograms of enap-2 per ml (approximately 15 microm) for 2 h. exposure of e. coli and p. aeruginosa to 200 micrograms of enap-2 per ml for 2 h resulted in 90.2 and 77.6% reduction, respectively, in the  numbers of cfu per milliliter. bacteriostasis, without bactericidal activity, occurred after k. pneumoniae was incubated with 200 micrograms of enap-2 per ml.  additional studies will be required in other species and cell types to determine  whether enap-2 is restricted to equine neutrophils or is the index member of a larger family of endogenous antibiotics.

AB  == the authors studied antimicrobial activities of cefetamet (cfmt) and other leading oral antimicrobials of beta-lactam class against clinically isolated strains from urban respiratory tract infection (rti) patients from january to march, 1992. 1. cfmt showed potent antimicrobial activities against "3 primary pathogens" of rtis i.e., streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, and haemophilus influenzae, but the drug had a slightly higher mic than those of a few oxime-type cephems already on the market. 2. cfmt was as stable as cefixime to beta-lactamase, generated by moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, which reduces the antimicrobial activity of cephems. 3. blood concentrations of cfmt after administering cefetamet pivoxil (cfmt-pi), an oral form of the drug, exceeded the mic80 against the "3 primary pathogens" as well as m. (b) catarrhalis and klebsiella pneumoniae, for a duration of approximately 9 and 11 hours, respectively, after single doses of 250 and 500 mg. this suggests that cfmt could remain above the mics for a sufficient time period with twice daily dosages of normal dose levels. 4. it is concluded that cfmt-pi will be useful for treating urban rtis.

AB  == antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (caz) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout japan in 1989 and 1991. those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic90 of caz in 1991 were markedly higher against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. also, among other bacteria such as providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to caz were observed in high proportions. however, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of caz on streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella spp, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, haemophilus influenzae and anaerobic gpc (gram-positive cocci). 2. among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant gram-negative bacilli of enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. it appears therefore, that caz failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these  strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. antimicrobial activities of caz on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. however, it was also demonstrated that caz maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. when it is additionally taken into account that caz is one of those limited drugs with activity against p. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that caz still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.

TI  == dna amplification fingerprinting of bacteria.
AB  == we have amplified short arbitrary stretches of total bacterial dna to produce highly characteristic and complex dna fingerprints. this dna amplification fingerprinting (daf) strategy involves enzymatic amplification of dna directed by a single arbitrary oligonucleotide primer. amplification produces a characteristic spectrum of products that is adequately resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by silver staining. although daf is simple in  concept, we found that amplification parameters must be within an optimal range for reproducibility. we establish a safe window for these parameters, which include magnesium, primer and enzyme concentration as well as cycle number. the refined procedure was used to distinguish between clinical isolates of streptococcus uberis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli. the use of template dna concentrations higher than 1 ng.microliters-1 and high mgcl2 levels  was especially important for reproducibility when amplifying small bacterial genomes. we tested a truncated thermus aquaticus dna polymerase, the stoffel fragment, and found it more tolerant of reaction conditions, more efficient in the amplification of short products, and able to produce more informative fingerprints when compared to the normal thermostable polymerase from which it was derived. because daf produces representative fingerprints quickly and reliably from bacteria regardless of prior genetic or biochemical knowledge, we anticipate the general use of this diagnostic tool for bacterial identification and taxonomy.

TI  == identification of enap-1, an antimicrobial peptide from equine neutrophils.
AB  == endogenous, cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides known as defensins are prominent components of human, rabbit, and rat neutrophils, yet little is known about their occurrence in other mammalian species. although we did not detect mature (i.e., processed) defensins in equine neutrophil granules, we found that these granules  contained small amounts of other cysteine-rich peptides with antimicrobial activity. one of these, enap-1, was purified by a combination of gel permeation and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography from acid extracts prepared from the cytoplasmic granules of equine neutrophils. the molecular mass  of enap-1 was approximately 7.2 kda, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. amino acid analysis revealed that enap-1 had an unusually high cysteine content and that it was relatively enriched in alanine, glycine, lysine, and proline residues. the partial (n-terminal) amino acid sequence of enap-1 was dvqcgeghfchdxqtccrasqggxaccpysqgvccadqrhccpvgf. thirty-six of these residues (78.3%) were identical to those of a recently cloned human neutrophil peptide of  unknown function and belonging to the granulin family. homologous peptides have also been noted in rat bone marrow cells and rat kidney epithelins. we tested the ability of enap-1 to kill several equine uterine pathogens. streptococcus zooepidemicus was killed most effectively, sustaining a greater than 99.8% decrease in cfu per milliliter after a 2-h exposure to 100 micrograms of enap-1 per ml (approximately 15 microm). escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa were somewhat less susceptible, manifesting 87.0 and 87.1% mean decreases in cfu  per milliliter, respectively, after incubation for 2 h with 200 micrograms of enap-1 per ml. klebsiella pneumoniae numbers were not significantly reduced after exposure to enap-1. these antimicrobial properties suggest that enap-1 may contribute to phagocyte-mediated host defense against equine infections.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of major oral antibacterial agents against clinically isolated microbial strains from outpatients with respiratory tract infection].
AB  == minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for major oral antibacterial agents for clinically isolated microbial strains from materials collected from outpatients with respiratory tract infections in 1988, 1989 and 1990, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) appeared to be responsible for community-acquired respiratory tract infections, but there also was a tendency showing that mrsa increased year by year. 2. a tendency was observed indicating that benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive streptococcus pneumoniae (pisp) increased year by year. 3. beta-lactamase-producing strains of haemophilus influenzae were observed in a certain ratio, and also those of branhamella catarrhalis were found in high ratios. 4. a tendency of increasing resistance of klebsiella pneumoniae to new quinolones was observed. 5. it is of a great importance to evaluate methods of selecting primary choice antibiotic agents since increasing numbers of new oral antibacterial agents are becoming rapidly available.

AB  == ofloxacin, a newer broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone, was evaluated against 6967 clinical isolates in a multicenter surveillance trial using a standardized disk diffusion method. thirty-five geographically diverse laboratories contributed zone diameter results for two (ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin) to five (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, cefaclor, and cefixime) antimicrobial agents, depending on the site of infection. ofloxacin was determined to have the widest spectrum of activity and potential empiric use (90.6%, range 87.1%-92.2%) for respiratory tract, urinary tract, and cutaneous infections. the spectrum was superior to ciprofloxacin (average 85.3% versus three sites), ampicillin (35.5%,  respiratory tract), cefaclor (60.5%, respiratory tract), cefixime (60.9%, respiratory tract), and norfloxacin (87.3%, urinary tract). strains resistant to  ofloxacin (35 isolates, 0.5%) were confirmed by reference laboratory tests and cross resistance was observed among several current and investigational fluoroquinolone agents. the species most often found to be fluoroquinolone resistant among the enterobacteriaceae were klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and providencia spp. monitoring for increasing fluoroquinolone resistance should be considered as greater use of drugs in this class develops. by these cited statistics, ofloxacin appears to have a broad and balanced spectrum of potential use, particularly against gram-positive pathogens.

AB  == antibiotic activities (mics) of ceftriaxone (ctrx) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of  other cephems. 1. when compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated mic90s of ctrx: staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and providencia spp. no changes were observed in mic90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and peptostreptococcus spp. 2. the mic90 of ctrx to s. pneumoniae was high because a  large number of benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp) was present among this species. the mic80 to bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. other oxime-type cephems also had high mics against the above mentioned bacteria. therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as ctrx against pisp and b. fragilis group. 3. sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), cephamycin-resistant  as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. some of there resistant bacteria  are also ctrx-resistant, and ctrx had insufficient activities against them. 4. with regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with ctrx-resistance from year to year,  the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989  and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. it appears that those strains resistant to cephems including ctrx are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. ctrx, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. furthermore, considering that ctrx is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that ctrx is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.

AB  == loracarbef is a new oral antimicrobial of the carbacephem class with in vitro activity against the common pathogens associated with skin infections, otitis media, sinusitis, bronchopulmonary infections, and urinary tract infections. a review of the literature shows the following ranges for 90% minimum inhibitory concentration (mic90) values (microgram/ml) against the organisms that commonly cause these illnesses: streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.25-2.0; moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive), 0.5-8.0; m. catarrhalis (beta-lactamase negative), 0.12-0.25; haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive), 0.5-16.0; h. influenzae (beta-lactamase negative), 0.25-8.0; escherichia coli, 2.0-25; klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.25-8.0; proteus mirabilis, 1.0-8.0; streptococcus pyogenes, less than or equal to 0.06-1.0; staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase positive), 8.0; s. aureus (beta-lactamase negative), 1.0-2.0. the in vitro activity of loracarbef against these common outpatient pathogens is similar to that of other oral antimicrobials such as cefaclor, cefuroxime axetil, cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. the results of in vitro susceptibility tests with  any antimicrobial, including loracarbef, are somewhat dependent on the specific test method that is employed in the laboratory. this is particularly true with h. influenzae. furthermore, the results of loracarbef susceptibility tests are of uncertain value in predicting therapeutic outcome.

AB  == the aminothiazolyl-cephalosporin ru 29 246 is the active metabolite of the prodrug-pivaloyl-oxyethyl-ester hr 916. ru 29 246 in vitro activity includes a wide range of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens. against methicillin-sensitive staphylococci ru 29 246 (mic90 of 0.25 approximately 2 micrograms/ml) was clearly more active than cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, cefixime and ceftibuten, but slightly less active than cefdinir. ru 29 246 inhibited hemolytic streptococci of the serogroups a, b, c and g as well as penicillin-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations similar to cefdinir, cefpodoxime and cefuroxime (mic90 less than or equal to 0.13 micrograms/ml), but less than the other oral cephalosporins investigated (cefixime, cefaclor and ceftibuten). mic90s of ru 29 246 against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, salmonella spp., shigella spp.,  proteus mirabilis and haemophilus influenzae were less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. only ru 29 246 and cefdinir demonstrated moderate activity against acinetobacter baumannii (mic90 greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml). most strains of pseudomonas spp., serratia marcescens, enterobacter spp., hafnia alvei and bacteroides spp. were resistant to ru 29 246. ru 29 246 killed escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus at a rate of 99% to 99.9% at concentrations of two times mic. the ph value of the medium (range 5.5 to 8.5) and the inoculum size (range 10(5) to 10(7) cfu/ml) had no or only low influence on the antibacterial activity of ru 29 246. ru 29 246 is a broad spectrum cephalosporin including in its activity both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens and therefore--depending on the bioavailability of its prodrug--looks promising as to its therapeutic perspective.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of levofloxacin was compared with those of ofloxacin,  ciprofloxacin, and other antibiotics. in general, levofloxacin was equally active or up to fourfold more active than ofloxacin against all 801 organisms tested. levofloxacin was twofold [corrected] more active than ciprofloxacin against streptococcus pneumoniae and 2- to 4-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against  staphylococcus aureus, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis. levofloxacin was two- to eightfold more active than ciprofloxacin against coagulase-negative staphylococci and acinetobacter spp., although these improvements in potency may not be clinically relevant. levofloxacin inhibited 90% of streptococci when it was used at concentrations of 1 to 2 micrograms/ml. levofloxacin was two- to fourfold less active than ciprofloxacin against most members of the family enterobacteriaceae, such as escherichia coli; klebsiella pneumoniae; citrobacter, proteus, providencia, salmonella, and yersinia spp.; and pseudomonas aeruginosa. both compounds were equally active against pseudomonas cepacia. the in vitro dna gyrase inhibitory activity of levofloxacin was as potent as that of ciprofloxacin, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.65 micrograms/ml against an e. coli enzyme. in vivo, oral treatment with levofloxacin was as efficacious or more efficacious than that with ciprofloxacin  in systemic as well as pyelonephritis infections in mice. levofloxacin achieved higher concentrations in the serum and tissue of mice than did ciprofloxacin. this study presents some potential advantages of the pure l isomer of ofloxacin over ciprofloxacin and other quinolones.

TI  == loracarbef (ly163892) versus amoxicillin/clavulanate in the treatment of acute purulent bacterial bronchitis.
AB  == in this single-blind study, 488 patients with acute bronchitis were randomly assigned to receive 400 mg of loracarbef twice daily or 500/125 mg of amoxicillin/clavulanate three times daily for seven days. treatment efficacy was  evaluated in 98 patients treated with loracarbef and in 99 treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate in whom pretreatment positive cultures of pathogens susceptible to both study drugs were found. streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, and klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated in pure or mixed cultures in 64% of the evaluable patients; s pneumoniae was found in 26%. among the evaluable patients, the rate of favorable clinical responses (cure and improvement) in the loracarbef group (96 of 98 patients; 98.0%) was similar to that in the amoxicillin/clavulanate group (96 of 99 patients; 97.0%); the favorable bacteriologic response rates were also similar (93.7% vs 92.9%, respectively). eight patients in the loracarbef group and nine in the amoxicillin/clavulanate group discontinued treatment because of adverse events. the events were presumed to be drug related in five of the loracarbef group and in seven of the amoxicillin/clavulanate group. during therapy, diarrhea was the most frequently reported event in both groups. however, it occurred in only 8.2% of the loracarbef-treated patients compared with 22.5% of the amoxicillin/clavulanate patients (p less than 0.001). it is concluded that both loracarbef and amoxicillin/clavulanate are safe and effective in the treatment of acute purulent bacterial bronchitis.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of a new quinolone, opc-17116.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of opc-17116 were compared with those of ofloxacin, enoxacin, ciprofloxacin, and tosufloxacin. the mics of opc-17116 for 90% of the strains tested were 0.125 to 8 micrograms/ml against gram-positive bacteria such as members of the genera staphylococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus: less than or equal to 0.063 to 16 micrograms/ml  against members of the family enterobacteriaceae; and less than or equal to 0.063 to 16 micrograms/ml against glucose-nonfermentative bacilli such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. the activity of opc-17116 against gram-positive organisms was comparable to that of tosufloxacin and higher than those of other reference drugs. the in vitro activity of opc-17116 against gram-negative bacteria was similar to those of the reference drugs. in experimental systemic infections in mice with various organisms, the efficacy of opc-17116 was similar to that of tosufloxacin and greater than those of ofloxacin, enoxacin, and ciprofloxacin. in a pyelonephritic model in mice with p. aeruginosa ku-1, opc-17116 was as active as ciprofloxacin and more active than ofloxacin, enoxacin, and tosufloxacin. in respiratory tract infections in mice with staphylococcus aureus smith, streptococcus pneumoniae tms 3, and klebsiella pneumoniae 3k25, the efficacy of opc-17116 was generally greater than that of tosufloxacin. the peak level of opc-17116 in the lungs of mice was 10 times higher than that in serum and was significantly greater than levels in lung achieved with an equivalent dose of the other quinolones. the therapeutic efficacy of opc-17116 may depend not only on its in vitro activity but also on its high concentration in tissue.

TI  == [a clinical study on panipenem/betamipron in chronic respiratory tract infections].
AB  == panipenem/betamipron (cs-976, papm/bp), a new carbapenem antibiotic, was administered a single dose of 500 mg or 750 mg via intravenous drip infusion twice a day for treatment of chronic respiratory infection to study its clinical  efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and safety. twenty nine cases were studied for the efficacy evaluation. only the safety evaluation was made in 6 cases which were judged to be unsuitable, because in some of them pneumonia and other diseases were not specified as the subject diseases, of serious illness in some the conditions were too serious, and in the other cases the duration of administration was insufficient since administration had to be discontinued due to side-effects. the duration of administration was 6 to 18 days with 1 g divided into 2 doses daily or 4 to 15 days with 1.5 g in 2 divided doses daily. when clinical efficacies were classified according to different diseases, this preparation was effective in 11 cases and slightly effective in 1 case of 12 cases of chronic bronchitis with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. it was effective in 10 cases, slightly effective in 1 case and ineffective in 1 case of 12 cases of bronchiectasis with an efficacy rate of 83.3%. it was slightly effective in 2 and ineffective in 1 out of 3 cases of diffuse panbronchiolitis, and was effective in 2 cases of pulmonary emphysema with infections. papm/bp was given at a dose level of 1 g in 2 divided doses daily to 17 cases and that of 1.5 g in 2 divided doses  daily to 10 cases. for the remaining 2 cases, changes in the dose level were made in middle course of treatment. the efficacy rate in the 1 g regimen was 76.5% and that with the 1.5 g regimen was 90%. the overall results in the 29 cases included 23 effective, 4 slightly effective and 2 ineffective cases, thus the overall efficacy rate was 79.3%. as pathogens, 11 species including 24 strains were isolated and identified from 19 cases. they were gram-positive cocci including 2  strains each of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 strain each of staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus viridans  and a strain of streptococcus spp., and gram-negative rods including 9 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 strains of haemophilus influenzae and 1 strain each of  klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas spp.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [a study on in vitro antibacterial activity and clinical usefulness in respiratory tract infections of panipenem/betamipron, a newly synthesized carbapenem antibiotic].
AB  == panipenem/betamipron (papm/bp) is a combination drug of papm, a new parenteral carbapenem antibiotic and bp, an amino acid derivative at a weight ratio of 1:1.  its in vitro antibacterial activities against clinically isolated respiratory pathogenic bacteria were determined. it was superior to imipenem (ipm) in the in  vitro antibacterial activities against haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus including mrsa, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens and escherichia coli. papm had antibacterial activities almost equal to those of ipm against streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus spp. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, its antibacterial activity was about 1/4 that of ipm. the clinical usefulness of papm/bp was studied by dissolving it in a solution containing lactate and administering the solution by intravenous drip infusion to 12 cases of respiratory tract infections. out of 11 cases with respiratory tract infections excluding cytomegalovirus pneumonia, the efficacy rate was 90.9%, with 4 cases of excellent and 6 cases of good responses. in terms of its bacteriological efficacies, eradication of pathogenic bacteria including super-infection were observed in 2 out of 4 strains, but 2 strains of p. aeruginosa remained unchanged. six strains appeared as superinfected bacteria during and after administration of this preparation substituting original pathogens. side-effects  were not observed in the 12 cases, and in laboratory tests, slight transient increases of s-got and s-gpt were found in 1 case. in conclusion, papm/bp is a very useful parenteral antibiotic against respiratory tract infections and can be one of the drugs of the first choice.

TI  == a comparison of antimicrobial activity of ofloxacin, l-ofloxacin, and other oral  agents for respiratory pathogens.
AB  == the attainable inhibitory ratios (ar) for oral antibiotics were calculated by using literature reports of concentrations attained in respiratory secretions for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (amx/ca), ofloxacin (ofl), l-ofloxacin (l-ofl), cefuroxime (cefu), ciprofloxacin (cip), and enoxacin (eno), and using microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration data of these antimicrobials against the common bacterial respiratory pathogens. ar of each antibiotic against the pathogens was expressed as multiples of the mics achieved at the respiratory  site. bacteria tested included staphylococcus aureus, group-a and group-b streptococci, viridans streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, brahamella catarrhalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, eikenella corrodens, haemophilus influenzae,  h. parainfluenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and legionella pneumophila. the antimicrobials with the narrowest spectrum of activity were amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefuroxime which had high attainable inhibitory ratios only against gram-positive cocci. ofloxacin and l-oflaxacin were among the quinolones with the highest overall ars against respiratory pathogen, including,  l. pneumophila, h. influenzae, and b. catarrhalis. all agents showed no, or inadequately low ars for p. aeruginosa.

TI  == cefetamet pivoxil: a review of its microbiology, toxicology, pharmacokinetics and clinical efficacy.
AB  == cefetamet pivoxil is an oral, third-generation cephalosporin whose broad spectrum of antibacterial activity and favorable pharmacokinetic profile make it particularly suitable for the treatment of a wide range of infectious diseases. cefetamet has high in vitro activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria that cause a number of respiratory tract and urinary tract infections. these include penicillin-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus spp, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, proteus spp., klebsiella spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae. it is not active against staphylococci, enterococci, pseudomonas spp. or bacteroides fragilis but does inhibit most bile-sensitive (oral) bacteroides spp. animal toxicology studies indicate that neither cefetamet pivoxil nor the active compound cefetamet have significant teratogenic, mutagenic, photogenic or allergenic potential. cefetamet is eliminated unchanged in the urine with a half-life of 2.2 h. volume of distribution approximates the extracellular fluid space (0.3 1/kg), protein binding is minima (22%) and oral bioavailability of cefetamet pivoxil is approximately 50% when taken with food. no significant drug interactions have been noted to date. the efficacy and tolerability of cefetamet pivoxil have been  evaluated in the treatment of gram-positive and gram-negative infections in almost 5,000 patients. in comparative studies, cefetamet pivoxil was at least as  effective, and in many cases clinically superior, to most currently recommended antibiotics for the treatment of urinary tract infections including gonorrhea and complicated infections in high risk patients. efficacy has also been demonstrated in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, pneumonia and infections of the ear, nose and throat. clinical trials have shown that a 7 day treatment period with cefetamet pivoxil is as effective as a 10 day course of phenoxymethylpenicillin in the treatment of pharyngotonsillitis. cefetamet pivoxil has been well-tolerated in clinical trials with only 1.2% of patients on  standard doses discontinuing therapy prematurely. the most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting) which occur in less than 10% of patients. many current antibiotic treatment regimens involve the administration of three or more daily doses. however, standard doses of cefetamet pivoxil 500 mg twice daily provide unbound plasma concentrations of cefetamet which generally exceed the mic(90) for susceptible organisms throughout the dosing interval and have been demonstrated to be clinically effective. this should result in good compliance with therapy in out-patients. dosing regimens for cefetamet pivoxil should be adjusted in patients with impaired renal function while standard doses  can be given to elderly patients and those with liver disease. standard doses in  children are 10 mg/kg or alternatively, children may receive a dose reduced in proportion to the ratio of their body surface area to that of an adult.

TI  == oral ofloxacin therapy for lower respiratory tract infection.
AB  == we made an open, noncomparative evaluation of ofloxacin, 400 mg orally bid for 10 days, in 98 subjects with community-acquired pneumonia or pathogen-confirmed bronchitis. thirty-nine (40%) of the subjects were treated in the hospital and 59 (60%) were treated as outpatients. the mean age of those treated was 56.2 years;  73 (74%) of the subjects either were more than 60 years old or had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or both. there were 95 organisms initially isolated in sputum, aspirate, or lavage fluid; all were susceptible to ofloxacin, and none acquired resistance during therapy. haemophilus influenzae was the most  common pathogen (19 isolates), followed by streptococcus pneumoniae (18) and staphylococcus aureus (10). clinical responses included cure in 70 patients (71%), improvement in 26 (27%), and failure in two (2%). after 10 days of therapy, pathogens persisted in two cases; in one case, streptococcus salivarius  was isolated, though it remained susceptible to ofloxacin, and in the other, klebsiella pneumoniae was accompanied by superinfection due to a resistant strain of serratia marcescens. we included in this study three confirmed cases of atypical pneumonia successfully treated with ofloxacin, two of them due to mycoplasma pneumonia and one to legionella pneumophila. ofloxacin was well tolerated. our data indicate that ofloxacin is effective and safe as specific and empiric treatment for many lower respiratory tract infections.

TI  == effects of growth factors, hormones, bacterial lipopolysaccharides, and lipotechoic acids on the clonal growth of normal ureteral epithelial cells in serum-free culture.
AB  == in vitro tissue culture techniques were employed to study the effects of bacterial endotoxins on the growth of normal epithelial cells from the human ureter (nhu). primary cultures of nhu cells were initiated from explant outgrowth cultures of human ureteral tissue and cultured on collagen gel in f-12* medium containing 1% fetal calf serum (fcs). optimal clonal growth of secondary cultures of nhu cells seeded at relatively low seeding cell densities, directly on plastic dishes, was achieved in f-12* medium containing bovine pituitary extract (0.5% bpe) and 0.05% bsa. results indicated that insulin in the f-12* medium could be replaced by three orders of magnitude less igf-1. further clonal growth experiments demonstrated that pge1 is growth stimulatory and can replace bpe as a growth factor requirement. this finding was in agreement with the fact that bpe growth requirement could be replaced by cholera toxin or dibutyryl camp. these results suggested that both bpe and cholera toxin operated by activation of a camp-dependent mitogenic pathway. seven gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharides (lps) and three gram-positive bacterial lipotechoic acids (lt) were tested for their effects on nhu clonal growth. three out of the five lps derived from escherichia coli (strains 055:b5, 0128:b12, and 0127:b8), lps from klebsiella pneumoniae, and lps from pseudomonas aeruginosa all showed significant growth inhibitory effects at minimally effective doses ranging from 5 to 25 micrograms/ml. lps derived from e. coli strain (0111:b4) had no growth effects at the highest concentration tested (100 micrograms/ml). in contrast, lt  derived from streptococcus pyogenes, s. faecalis, staphylococcus aureas, and bacillus subtilis all markedly enhanced clonal growth at concentrations ranging from 1 microgram/ml less than [lt] less than 50 micrograms/ml. lt from strep. pyogenes was inhibitory to clonal growth at 100 micrograms/ml. the growth inhibitory effects of lps were shown to be sensitive to the presence of hydrocortisone in the growth medium, indicating that lps effects on growth are mediated via the arachidonic acid cascade. we speculate that these results indicate a link between the susceptibility of uroepithelial tissue to the pathogenic microflora seen in urinary tract diseases and the differential sensitivity of proliferation-competent uroepithelial cells to growth inhibition by lps produced by gram-negative bacteria. however, further studies with uropathogenic serotypes will be necessary to corroborate this possibility. the growth-stimulating activity of lts produced by gram-positive bacteria may be due  to their ability to bind to cell-associated fibronectin and to activate the fibronectin receptor as part of ligand receptor-induced mitogenic transmembrane signalling pathway.

AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of meropenem were compared with those of imipenem, ceftazidime, flomoxef, cefuzonam and cefotiam. meropenem showed a broad antibacterial spectrum against clinical isolates of gram-positive  and gram-negative bacteria. against gram-negative bacteria, with the exception of acinetobacter calcoaceticus, meropenem exhibited the most potent activity among the drugs tested. it inhibited all 330 strains of enterobacteriaceae at 0.78 mg/l. meropenem was sensitive against several cephem-resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, meropenem was four-fold more  active than imipenem and eight-fold more active than ceftazidime, with an mic90 of 0.78 mg/l. the therapeutic effect of meropenem on systemic infection in mice was ten to twenty-fold less than that of imipenem against staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. however, meropenem was as effective as imipenem on infections of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter calcoaceticus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. meropenem was eliminated from mice plasma two-fold faster than imipenem, with a plasma half-life of 7.6 min. from the above results the authors concluded that meropenem is a promising drug for clinical use.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefodizime.
AB  == cefodizime is a bactericidal cephem with the typical broad spectrum activity of an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, including both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria: its mic90 is 0.125 mg/l for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and other streptococci; and 0.05 mg/l for haemophilus spp., neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae and moraxella catarrhalis; while beta-lactamase positive strains of m. catarrhalis require 1 mg/l. less than 1 mg/l is needed for escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus spp. and shigella spp. the mic90 is 4 mg/l for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, morganella morganii, providencia spp. and most strains of serratia marcescens, citrobacter spp. and enterobacter spp. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis and most strains of pseudomonas spp. and acinetobacter spp. are considered cefodizime-resistant. cefodizime is unaffected by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but it is hydrolyzed by some chromosomally mediated enzymes, thus resembling other third-generation cephalosporins. cefodizime has high affinity for pbp 3 and pbp ia and ib (escherichia coli); in s. aureus it shows the highest affinity for pbp 1.

TI  == [bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of 5% and 10% granules of  cefdinir in the pediatric field].
AB  == bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefdinir (cfdn, fk482),  a new oral cephalosporin, 5% and 10% granules, were performed in the field of pediatrics. the results are summarized below. 1. antibacterial activities antibacterial activities of cfdn against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were studied in comparison with those of cefaclor (ccl), cefixime (cfix) and amoxicillin (ampc).  mic80's of cfdn against s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, h. influenzae, b.  catarrhalis, k. pneumoniae and e. coli were 0.78, 0.20, less than or equal to 0.025, 0.39, 0.10, 0.20 and 0.10 micrograms/ml, respectively. these results show  that cfdn has high antibacterial activities against these organisms. mic80's of cfdn against gram-positive bacteria were similar to those of ampc, and was lower  than those of ccl and cfix. as for antibacterial activities against gram-negative bacteria (gnb), the mic80 of cfix against h. influenzae was 0.05 micrograms/ml, which was slightly lower than that of cfdn. the mic80's of cfdn against other gnb were similar to those of cfix. 2. absorption and excretion blood concentrations and urinary excretion rates of cfdn 5% and 10% granules and 100 mg capsule were determined. the data on cfdn 10% granules were similar to those on cfdn 5% granules. at a dose of 3 mg/kg, peak blood concentrations (cmax's) of cfdn ranged from 0.20 to 2.12 micrograms/ml with 5% granules and from 0.50 to 1.15 micrograms/ml with 10% granules at 2 to 3 hours after dosing. at a dose of 6 mg/kg, peak concentrations were 0.66-2.06 micrograms/ml and 0.70-1.52 micrograms/ml with 5% granules and with 10% granules, respectively. at 8 hours after dosing, blood concentrations were 0.04-0.54 micrograms/ml at 3 mg/kg and 0.06-0.27 micrograms/ml at 6 mg/kg. blood half-lives were 1.33-4.36 hours at 3 mg/kg and 1.14-3.27 hours at 6 mg/kg. auc's were 1.7-11.0 micrograms.hr/ml with 3 mg/kg and 2.4-8.7 micrograms.hr/ml with 6 mg/kg. with administration of single 100 mg capsule, cmax's, blood concentrations after 8 hours, t1/2's and auc's were 0.79-1.88 micrograms/ml, 0.20 micrograms/ml, 1.54-2.72 hours, and 5.2 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. urinary recovery rates in the first 8 hours ranged from 6.85 to 39.2% with 3 mg/kg and 6.08-25.5% with 6 mg/kg.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == the relative lethality of intestinal bacteria for gnotobiotic rats with experimental intestinal strangulation.
AB  == in eight experiments utilizing 28 animals each, germfree rats with and without ischemically or hemorrhagically strangulated closed loop intestinal segments were contaminated with either one of four common intestinal anaerobic bacteria, or a combination of two or three bacteria previously found to be innocuous in pure culture. the results showed that: a) in pure culture, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius were innocuous; b) fusobacterium necrophorum alone was a very lethal organism that produced intense, confluent, intraperitoneal, fibrous adhesions after four to six days; and c) mixed inoculum of klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and/or streptococcus faecalis was found to be lethal for gnotobiotic rats with intestinal strangulation. it is concluded that fusobacterium necrophorum is so patent that it should be specifically treated with antibiotics when suspected or  known to be present in clinical specimens. this gnotobiotic animal model will be  useful to delineate the lethality of known combinations of intestinal bacteria.

TI  == [preparation and use of fish fillet infusion as a basic medium for culturing bacteria].
AB  == the authors present the first results on the utilization of fish infusion (ifp) as a basic medium for the cultivation of bacteria. the infusion was obtained from a common marine fish, corvina (micropogonias furnieri) according to the technique used in the preparation of beef infusion broth. streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis were cultured in liquid and solid media prepared with ifp as well as in recommended standard media. solid media used for cultivation of s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, n. meningitidis and c. jejuni were supplemented with 5% of defibrinated sheep blood and for the latter, substances recommended to increase aerotolerance were included in solid and liquid media. all of these strains grew on the media prepared with ifp except s.  pneumoniae when cultured in ifp diluted 1:2 with a sodium chloride solution. only s. pyogenes produced colonies smaller than those of the standard medium. no more  differences were detect in the observation of colony morphology. the growth of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and b. subtilis was  measured in liquid media after 8 hours. in solid media, the growth index was expressed by dividing the number of colonies produced in ifp-agar and nutriente agar by the number of colonies on trypticase soy agar plates. some differences were observed in colonial size and morphology when compared with those generated  in standard media. the average value obtained from the analyses of total proteins by biuret reaction in twelve batches of ifp was 5.03 mg/ml. the experiments showed that culture media prepared with ifp supported the growth of bacterial strains used in this work. it suggests that fish infusion has promising conditions of being an alternative substrate for cultural purposes.

TI  == treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: state of the art.
AB  == effective treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (abe)  reduces the number of such exacerbations in such patients and may decrease or eliminate background symptoms and improve pulmonary function. the pathologic and  physiologic abnormalities of the bronchial system in chronic bronchitis that predispose to bacterial infection probably include impaired mucociliary clearance, obstructed bronchioles, and bacterial infections of the bronchial epithelium. exacerbations of bronchopulmonary symptoms are usually observed with  abe, although these symptoms are not unique to abe. while culture and sensitivity testing is not usually required, microscopic examination of sputum is critical to determine the presence of bacterial infection. bacteria in numbers significantly  above the levels present when the patient's condition is stable and at least a doubling of the sputum neutrophil inflammatory level are essential criteria. bacterial species observed with abe include haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and neisseria species, with a lesser incidence of klebsiella and pseudomonas species. one or more elements of background therapy for abe should accompany antimicrobial therapy, for example, physiotherapy, bronchodilators, and so forth. ampicillin is effective, safe, economical, and thus remains the drug of choice for abe. quinolones are an effective alternative when ampicillin cannot be tolerated or if organisms are resistant. dosing is at the upper range of recommendations, and the chosen drug should be given for a 10-14-day regimen. patients should be reevaluated if symptoms and physical findings do not return to baseline after 5-7 days.

TI  == [bactericidal effect of cefadroxil, amoxicillin alone or in combination with clavulanic acid in sera of healthy volunteers].
AB  == determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) provides data on the susceptibility or resistance of a bacteria; however, in susceptible bacteria this parameter is not predictive of effectiveness of the antimicrobial agent. bactericidal activities of cefadroxil, of amoxicillin, and of the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination on bacteria commonly found in ent and lower respiratory tract disease were studied comparatively. the antibiotics were  given by the oral route to six healthy volunteers. with beta-lactamase-producing  and non-beta-lactamase-producing strains of escherichia coli, amoxicillin produced mics consistent with susceptibility but failed to exhibit a bactericidal effect, whereas cefadroxil was bactericidal. combination of amoxicillin with an inhibitor did not modify this activity on e. coli and failed to produce a bactericidal effect on klebsiella pneumoniae similar to that seen with cefadroxil. amoxicillin with and without clavulanic acid exhibited comparable effectiveness on streptococcus pyogenes and s. pneumoniae. the bactericidal effect of cefadroxil on s. pneumoniae was of similar magnitude but shorter duration than that of amoxicillin. cefadroxil and the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination had similar bactericidal effects against staphylococcus aureus. these antibiotics exhibited a time-dependent effect on gram positive microorganisms. these pharmacodynamic data, together with measures of bactericidal activity, may  be very helpful for selecting the appropriate antibiotic and dosage.

AB  == we investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antimicrobial agents at hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1989. the susceptibility testing was carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: (+++), (++), (+) and (-). ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, bacteroides fragilis and had rather strong activities against enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and achromobacter xylosoxidans, but was less active to staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and xanthomonas maltophilia. ipm has been found to have activities  superior to those of other antibiotics tested against e. faecalis, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa and b. fragilis. no antibiotics tested showed good activities against mrsa except minocycline.

TI  == bacteremia in patients with cirrhosis of the liver.
AB  == infections are frequent in patients with liver cirrhosis, as their defenses against infectious agents are altered. but bacteremia occurring in cirrhotic patients has seldom been reported in the literature. from 1981 to 1986, we collected 197 cases with 228 episodes of bacteremia for this retrospective study. the incidence of bacteremia in cirrhotic patients was 8.8%; no significant difference was noted between cirrhotic patients with variant etiologies of hbv(+), hbv(-) and alcohol. but the incidence increased with the severity of the  disease (1%, 4.8%, 17.1% in child's a, b, c groups, respectively). gram-negative  bacteria were the predominant microorganisms of bacteremia (75.6%). among them, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and aeromonas hydrophilia were the three  most commonly detected microorganisms. gram-positive bacterias were detected in 21.2% of patients with bacteremia, with predominance of the streptococcus group and staphylococcus aureus. in about 26.3% of cases the infectious sources were the same by bacteria cultures as from blood. the most common sources were spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, urinary tract infection, pneumonia and biliary tree infection. in cirrhotic patients with and without bacteremia, the mortality  rate increased significantly in the bacteremia group (54.8% vs 23.2%, p less than 0.05). by child's classification, the mortality of patients with classes b and c  increased significantly after onset of bacteremia. there was no significant difference in mortality between bacteremic patients in the hbv(+), hbv(-) and alcohol groups. in conclusion, bacteremia is a severe complication of liver cirrhosis and a sign of a poor prognosis.

TI  == drug treatment of pneumonia in the hospital. what are the choices?
AB  == mortality and morbidity of nosocomial pneumonia remain high. successful treatment of pulmonary infections depends on several factors including type of infection, offending pathogen, status of host defences, and adequate choice of antibiotic therapy. the physician's decision should aim at achieving antibiotic concentrations beyond the mic at the site of infection. gram-negative bacilli, notably pseudomonos aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli, remain the most frequent agents in nosocomial pneumonia. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae predominate among the gram-positive cocci. pneumocystis carinii predominates in immunocompromised patients. protected sample bronchoscopy associated with quantitative cultures of samples, and quantification of intracellular microorganisms in cells recovered by broncho-alveolar lavage are two promising procedures which might replace previous, more aggressive methods. penetration of antibiotics into lung tissue depends on physicochemical properties of the drug and the degree of inflammation of lung tissue. quinolones, macrolides, tetracyclines and trimethoprim penetrate well into bronchial secretions. penetration is moderate to low for aminoglycosides and beta-lactams.  fluoroquinolones and new beta-lactam agents, including third-generation cephalosporins imipenem, aztreonam and ticarcillin-clavulanate, showed comparative clinical efficacy in treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, with an efficacy rate close to 80%. aminoglycosides should not be used alone. combination therapy reduces but does not eliminate the risk of selection of gram-negative resistant mutants. it should not be used routinely except for p. aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens infections.

TI  == clinical & bacteriological profile of neonatal pneumonia.
AB  == in a prospective study of 44 neonates (33 outborn and 11 inborn) with pneumonia,  the bacteriology of pneumonia was determined by blood culture and serum counterimmunoelectrophoresis (ciep). twenty-nine babies also underwent lung aspiration. the lung aspirate was subjected to bacterial culture and ciep. ciep was done to detect the bacterial antigens of streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. absence of tachypnoea, found more commonly in low birth weight babies, was a poor prognostic sign. low birth weight babies had a significantly higher mortality than babies with normal birth weight. altogether,  a bacterial etiology of neonatal pneumonia could be established in 25 cases (56.7%). in 10 babies, strep. pneumoniae antigen was detected in serum and/or lung aspirate. micro-organisms were cultured from blood and/or lung aspirate from 17 babies. eleven babies (25%) grew gram negative bacteria. the common bacteria identified in decreasing order of frequency were strep. pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, acinatobacter lowfii, staph. aureus, pseudoamonas aeruginosa etc. all the gram negative bacteria as well as staphylococci were sensitive to amikacin while only 23.5 per cent was sensitive to gentamicin. all staphylococci isolated were sensitive to methicillin.

TI  == long-acting chloramphenicol versus intravenous ampicillin for treatment of bacterial meningitis.
AB  == in most developing countries, bacterial meningitis (bm) is associated with a high case-fatality rate. the search for a simple, convenient, and inexpensive antibiotic treatment remains a priority. in this study, a non-blinded, multicentre, randomised clinical trial of 528 cases of bm was done in two hospitals in mali and niger, between march, 1989, and may, 1990, to see whether a double injection of long-acting chloramphenicol (on admission to hospital and 48  h later) is as effective as a course of intravenous ampicillin (8 days, 4 times a day). the cumulative case-fatality rate on day 4 (principal end-point) among the  chloramphenicol (254 patients) and ampicillin (274) groups were, respectively, 28% and 24.5% (relative risk 1.14, 95% confidence interval 0.86-1.52). no outbreak occurred during the study period. the hospital case-fatality rate was 33.1%. main risk factors for death were associated with clinical condition on admission--ie, altered consciousness, convulsions, or dehydration. the case-fatality rates were 13% (21/161) for neisseria meningitidis, 36.1% (48/133)  for haemophilus influenzae, and 67% (77/115) for streptococcus pneumoniae. in a multiple logistic regression model, controlling for the differential distribution of potential risk factors (including bacterial species), there was no difference  between treatment groups. our findings suggest that long-acting chloramphenicol is a useful first-line presumptive treatment for bm in high-incidence countries.

TI  == microbiology of chronic sinusitis in children.
AB  == to better understand the factors involved in chronic sinusitis in childhood, we cultured the sinuses, middle meatus, and nasopharynx in 39 children requiring surgical intervention. sixty-nine percent of these patients had other medical problems, including asthma (49%) and immunologic compromise (18%). we cultured coagulase-negative staphylococcus in 18 patients, streptococcus viridans in 14 patients, normal flora in 10 patients, staphylococcus aureus in nine patients, group d streptococcus in five patients, corynebacterium in five patients, haemophilus influenzae in three patients, neisseria in three patients, and streptococcus pneumoniae, group a streptococcus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces, and an anaerobic gram-negative bacillus in one patient each. cultures yielded no growth  in nine patients. a strong association between cultures of the middle meatus obtained ipsilaterally and cultures of the maxillary (83%) and ethmoid sinuses (80%) occurred. a poor correlation was found between cultures of the nasopharynx  and maxillary (45%) and ethmoid sinuses (49%). all seven patients who had both maxillary and ethmoid sinus cultures showed the same organisms in both sinuses. only 41% of organisms were found on both sides when procedures were performed bilaterally. cultures of the middle meatus appear to be sensitive and specific for organisms within sinuses. the presence of predominantly nonvirulent organisms in low titers suggests that additional factors other than bacterial overgrowth contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic sinusitis in children.

TI  == postsepsis bradycardia in children with leukemia.
AB  == objective: we observed sinus bradycardia in a small number of children with hematologic malignancies who were recovering from sepsis. our objective was to define this symptom complex and attempt to delineate its etiology. design: retrospective chart review. setting: a pediatric icu in a children's oncology hospital. patients: children admitted to the icu over a 24-month period who developed persistent bradycardia (heart rate less than 5% for age for greater than 1 hr) after an episode of sepsis. measurements and main results: seven children developed postsepsis bradycardia. six patients had a primary diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia and one patient had acute lymphocytic leukemia. all patients had positive blood cultures (streptococcus mitis, n = 4; escherichia coli, n = 2; and klebsiella pneumoniae, n = 1). all seven children were clinically recovering from sepsis when the bradycardia developed. neither hypotension nor other symptom was associated with the bradycardia. no therapy was given for the bradycardia. echocardiograms and ecgs were normal in all patients,  except for the presence of bradycardia. bradycardia persisted for 24 to 72 hrs. after that time, heart rates slowly increased to the normal range for age. conclusions: we speculate that this syndrome may result from alterations in beta-adrenergic receptor function or an unidentified humoral factor produced by the invading organism or as part of the host's response to sepsis. prior drug therapy or the underlying illness may predispose to this condition, since all the patients had acute leukemia. as the bradycardia was clinically insignificant, invasive therapeutic or diagnostic strategies were not indicated.

TI  == cefaclor in the treatment of infective exacerbations of chronic bronchitis in cigarette smokers.
AB  == there is a direct correlation between number of cigarettes smoked and the incidence of lower respiratory tract infection in humans. in studies with smokers suffering from exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, the most common bacterial pathogens found were haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and branhamella catarrhalis. antibiotics should be effective against such possible pathogens. cefaclor has demonstrated in vitro activity against all these pathogens. we designed the present study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cefaclor in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis in cigarette smokers. a total of 106 patients were enrolled in the study. h. influenzae was the most common bacterial species isolated in the sputum (in 23.6% of the total sample), followed by s. pneumoniae (18.9%), s. aureus (17.0%), k. pneumoniae (7.5%) and b. catarrhalis (5.7%), while mixed forms were present in 22.6% of cases and other pathogens in 4.7%. cefaclor (500 mg) was given orally every 8h for 7 to 16 days (mean 10.73 +/- 2.11). analysis of clinical response data indicates that 75.5% of patients were cured and 17.0% improved. this finding is important because it demonstrates that cefaclor's spectrum of activity encompasses all the most likely pathogens encountered in smokers. because of its excellent response rate, cefaclor is of particular value  in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in cigarette smokers.

TI  == in vitro activity of ro 09-1428 compared to other cephalosporins.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ro 09-1428, a new catechol-type parenteral cephalosporin, was compared to that of ceftazidime, e-1040, cefpirome and cefepime against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. ro 09-1428 inhibited  group a streptococci at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, and group b, c  and g streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.5 micrograms/ml, whereas for staphylococcus aureus ro 09-1428 had mics of 8-16 micrograms/ml similar to ceftazidime and e-1040. against pseudomonas aeruginosa ro 09-1428 was the most active agent, inhibiting isolates at less than or equal to 0.12-2 micrograms/ml,  and inhibited ceftazidime-resistant isolates. the majority of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, providencia, salmonella and shigella were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml as with the other cephalosporins. for most citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae  ro 09-1428 had higher mics of 4-16 micrograms/ml; most ceftazidime-resistant isolates of these species were resistant. anaerobes, enterococci and listeria monocytogenes were resistant to ro 09-1428. ro 09-1428 was not hydrolyzed by tem-1, tem-2, staphylococcus aureus pc-1, moraxella catarrhalis bro-1, enterobacter p-99, pseudomonas aeruginosa sabath-abraham or klebsiella beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-7 and tem-9. ro 09-1428 was markedly less active at an acid ph.

TI  == [role of cefuroxime-axetil in the treatment of respiratory tract infections. bacteriological and pharmacological data].
AB  == cefuroxime-axetil, the 1-acetoxyethyl ester of cefuroxime, is a prodrug for oral  administration. the indication of this new formulation in the treatment of community acquired rti required an updating of its activity against respiratory pathogens. a total of 260 isolates were included in a study using mic determination (agar dilution technique): the mode mics for haemophilus spp., branhamella catarrhalis, streptococci, s. pneumoniae ranged from 0.016 to 0.5 mg/l; no difference was noted between beta-lactamase producers and non producers  in haemophilus and b. catarrhalis; coagulase positive staphylococci, e. coli, k.  pneumoniae isolated from rti exhibited mode mics not exceeding 4 mg/l (except for methicillin-r staphylococci mode mic greater than 128 mg/l). simultaneously the pharmacokinetic parameters were determined in healthy volunteers after a loading  dose (500 mg) of the drug: 7 consecutive samples collected after a light meal provided the following data: cmax = 7.77 +/- 2.2 mg/l; tmax = 2.33 +/- 0.23 hrs;  t1/2 beta = 1.18 +/- 0.19 hrs; auc = 22.17 +/- 6.4 h.mg/l. cmax and auc were half of these values after administration of 250 mg. these results, together with the  known intrinsic beta-lactamase stability of cefuroxime, should ensure sufficient  in vivo concentrations and effective in vivo antibacterial activity against most  respiratory pathogens after oral administration of cefuroxime-axetil.

TI  == rufloxacin once daily in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  == in this open study the efficacy and tolerability of rufloxacin in a single dose of 400 mg the first day and 200 mg the nine consecutive days was studied in 26 patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. twenty-two patients were evaluable for efficacy. four patients stopped treatment prematurely after five days because of clinical cure. at the enrollment visit a pathogen was isolated in the sputum sample in 19 of 22 evaluable patients. the predominant pathogens were streptococcus pneumoniae and moraxella catarrhalis. in 17 of these 19 bacteriologically evaluable patients the initial infecting organism was eradicated from specimens obtained within 48 hours after the end of therapy. there was one case of persistent infection caused by s. pneumoniae (mic 4 mg/l),  one patient had a superinfection with serratia marcescens (mic 1 mg/l) susceptible to rufloxacin and therapy was stopped after five days due to clinical failure. one week after the end of therapy, 15 patients remained free from infection whilst one patient experienced reinfection with klebsiella pneumoniae (mic 0.5 mg/l). clinical cure or improvement was observed in 21 of 22 patients. mild adverse events were reported by two of 26 enrolled patients. in one patient, complaining of headache and dizziness, the adverse events were considered possibly study drug related. no abnormal laboratory findings were reported. nadir plasma levels of rufloxacin were measured and no accumulation in plasma was observed during treatment. a ten day course of an oral single dose of rufloxacin  proved efficacious and was well tolerated in patients with an acute exacerbation  of chronic bronchitis.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1988)].
AB  == isolated bacteria from respiratory infectious diseases were collected in cooperation with institutions located throughout japan, since 1981, and ikemoto et al. have been examining sensitivities of the isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, relationships between the isolates and the backgrounds of the patients and so forth each year. we report here the research results for the  year 1988. in 18 institutions around the entire japan from october 1988 to september 1989, 554 strains of bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 439 patients with respiratory infectious diseases and assumed to be the etiologic bacteria. mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics against 68 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 102 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 120 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 86 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 65 strains of branhamella catarrhalis, 18 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and so forth, were determined, and the drug sensitivities of these strains were examined except for  the strains which died during transportation. the drug sensitivities of the main  strains were almost the same as those determined last year for each drug. however, s. aureus strains for which mics of methicillin were higher than 12.5 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) accounted for 38.2%, and the frequency of drug resistant bacteria increased over last year's 18.2%. also, we examined changes in the backgrounds of patients, the infectious diseases, and the etiologic bacteria and so forth. as to patient backgrounds, there were many infectious diseases found in a high age bracket, and the patients over age 60 accounted for 57.2% of the diseases. in the distribution by disease, bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for greatest numbers of cases 32.1% and 31.4%, respectively, followed by bronchiectasis and bronchial asthma. as for  frequencies of etiologic bacteria by disease, s. aureus (22.5%) and s. pneumoniae (15.4%) in pneumonia, s. pneumoniae (25.7%) and h. influenzae (24.1%) in chronic  bronchitis, h. influenzae (32.5%) and p. aeruginosa (23.8%) in bronchiectasis, and h. influenzae (31.4%), s. pneumoniae and b. catarrhalis (20.0%) in bronchial  asthma were the most frequent. regarding effects of administration of antibiotics and isolates obtained on each day after infection, those bacteria which were isolated before antibiotic administration and which decreased after administration included s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, and b. catarrhalis. frequencies of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, however, increased after antibiotic administration. also, when dosing continued for more than 15 days, the frequency  of p. aeruginosa increased rapidly.

TI  == [spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: occurrence in chronic liver disease patients  in recife].
AB  == a prospective research was made on spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (sbp) in chronic liver disease patients presenting with ascites. forty clinical cases, of  37 patients, were analysed. all subjects were submitted to clinical and laboratory evaluation and diagnostic paracentesis, and the material was obtained  for biochemical dosages, ph determination, cytology and bacterial cultures. thirty cases of sterile ascites and 10 of sbp (25%) were detected. in 5 (50%) with sbp, the clinical findings were characteristic, with fever, abdominal pain and rebound tenderness. in 2 patients (20%) the presentation was atypical, without the complete triad described above. finally in 3 (30%) sbp was silent, without any suggestive clinical manifestations of infection. in 7 cases (70%) cultures were positives; streptococcus pneumoniae (3 cases), streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus negative coagulase, staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae (one case each). in 7 (70%) sbp cases, the patients were admitted already infected in the hospital. lethality in the sbp group was 30% and in the sterile ascites was 13.3%. we concluded that sbp is a frequent cause of morbid-lethality in patients with ascites and chronic hepatopathy, presenting itself often in a typical clinical manifestations.

TI  == rapid diagnosis of legionella infection by a nonisotopic in situ hybridization method.
AB  == the authors report a nonradioactive adaptation of dna hybridization technology for the direct detection of legionella organisms in situ in routinely processed histologic specimens. the probe used consisted of synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides, complementary to the ribosomal rna of all clinically relevant legionella species, labeled with biotinylated dutp at their 3' ends. by  in situ dna hybridization and detection with an avidin-alkaline phosphatase complex. legionella was visualized by light microscopy within the alveoli of lung specimens in 9 of 13 direct fluorescent antibody- or culture-positive cases of legionnaires' disease. no cross-hybridization was observed in lung specimens infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, or other pathogens. the authors' results illustrate a novel adaptation of in situ dna hybridization techniques, usually used for viruses, to  the detection of a bacterial organism. the method enables direct visualization of bacterial nucleic acid in infected tissues and may facilitate early diagnosis and treatment of legionellosis.

AB  == the lacz gene from streptococcus thermophilus a054, a commercial yogurt strain, was cloned on a 7.2 kb psti fragment in escherichia coli and compared with the previously cloned lacz gene from s. thermophilus atcc 19258. using the dideoxy chain termination method, the dna sequences of both lacz structural genes were determined and found to be 3071 bp in length. when the two sequences were more closely analysed, 21 nucleotide differences were detected, of which only nine resulted in amino acid changes in the proteins, the remainder occurring in wobble positions of the respective codons. only three bases separated the termination codon for the lacs gene from the initiation codon for lacz, suggesting that the lactose utilization genes are organized as an operon. the amino acid sequence of  the beta-galactosidase, derived from the dna sequence, corresponds to a protein with a molecular mass of 116860 da. comparison of the s. thermophilus amino acid  sequences with those from lactobacillus bulgaricus, e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae showed 48, 35 and 32.5% identity respectively. although little sequence homology was observed at the dna level, many regions conserved in the amino acid sequence were identified when the beta-galactosidase proteins from s.  thermophilus, e. coli and l. bulgaricus were compared.

TI  == open randomized controlled parallel study of ofloxacin versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment of lower respiratory tract and urinary infections.
AB  == a total of 60 patients with lower respiratory tract or urinary tract infections were enrolled in an open, randomized, controlled, parallel study comparing 300 mg ofloxacin (ofx) b.i.d. with trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole (tmp 800 mg + smx 160 mg), 1 tablet, b.i.d. the signs and symptoms of low respiratory tract infection were cured in 12 patients (80%) of the ofx group and improved in 2 other patients (13%); at the end of therapy, the 2 germs that persisted were streptococcus pneumoniae and branhamella catarrhalis. clinical cure was achieved in 13 patients (86%) in the tmp-smx group, while 2 patients were considered as failures (14%); after therapy, the 3 organisms that persisted were 2 s. pneumoniae and 1 pseudomonas aeruginosa. as far as urinary tract infections are concerned clinical cure and complete eradication of bacteria were achieved in 14 patients in the ofx group (93%); the germ that persisted was escherichia coli (100,000 cfu), but the  patient was asymptomatic. in patients of the tmp-smx group the urinary infections were cured in 11 subjects (73%); the germs that persisted were 2 e. coli and 1 proteus mirabilis. adverse effects were reported for 3 patients (10%) in the ofx  group and 4 patients (13%) in the tmp-smx group. the measurement of serum and intracellular (polymorphonuclear cells and lymphocytes) levels of ofx and tmp-smx and the assessment of the host's immunocompetence ruled out the possibility of any immunotoxicological side effect.

TI  == the effect of antimicrobial therapy on mixed infections with bacteroides species. is eradication of the anaerobes important?
AB  == antimicrobial agents were used alone or in combinations in order to explore their effect on mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections. subcutaneous abscesses were induced in mice by single and mixed infections of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the infected animals were treated for 5 days with spiramycin, gentamicin or metronidazole alone, or metronidazole combined with spiramycin or gentamicin. animals were killed 5 days after inoculation and the bacterial contents of the abscesses determined. infection induced by a single species of bacteria always responded to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. in infections caused by two species of organisms, however, therapy directed at either the bacteroides sp. (with metronidazole) or the aerobes or facultative anaerobes (with spiramycin or  gentamicin) was effective not only in significantly reducing the numbers of the target organism but also, in 13 of 24 instances, in reducing to a small extent the numbers of the other bacteria. despite this phenomenon, in no instance did therapy with a single agent eliminate the infection and eradicate the untargeted  organism. the combination of spiramycin and metronidazole increased the reduction in numbers of b. melaninogenicus in single-organism infections and of bacteroides sp. in mixed infections with s. aureus and s. pyogenes. these findings support the need to aim treatment at all components of mixed infections.

AB  == for enterobacteriaceae, mic50s and mic90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: escherichia  coli 0.12 and 0.5, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, serratia  marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. the activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. haemophilus spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as n. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic50s and mic90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic50 and mic90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were generally resistant: streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (mic50 and mic90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium perfringens (mic50 and mic90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). these results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.

AB  == antimicrobial activities of minocycline (mino) against various clinical isolates, 270 strains obtained in 1988, were determined and the reliability of the mino disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics was studied. clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the disc tests, which is widely used in japan, and that of a 3 category system used in the usa and europe, were also evaluated to determine which system would be more suitable for the evaluation of proper dose levels of administration. in this study, mics were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. mic80 values of mino against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pneumoniae were all less than or equal to 0.78 micrograms/ml. those against haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris were 0.39, 6.25, 3.13, 25, 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. mic80 values against pseudomonas  aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, enterobacter spp., and citrobacter spp. were 50, 100, 50 and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. the inhibition zones obtained with  the disc method were compared with mics. the results of mino disc susceptibility  test either with 200 micrograms disc (showa) or 30 micrograms disc (prepared in this laboratory) were well correlated with mics, showing the reliability of the disc method in estimating approximate values of mics. in the 4 category classification system currently used, break points in mic values proposed are ( ) mic less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 2-10 micrograms/ml, (+) greater than 10-50 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 50 micrograms/ml. the results obtained with 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs showed false positive in 26.6% and 20.5% of the samples, and false negative in 5.8% and 23.6% of the samples, respectively. the disc results of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. pneumoniae, etc. were relatively well classified, but those of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, proteus spp. were not, showing more false positive results.  changing the lower 2 mic break points in the 4 category system to: ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, the false positive results with both 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs were  reduced to 12% and 6.2%, respectively. the false negative results were 5.8% and 23.6%, respectively.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [studies on respiratory infections in primary care clinic (iv). antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in the tohoku district of japan].
AB  == we determined the mics of ampicillin, methicillin, cefaclor, cefixime, cefteram,  ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against a total of 1,448 strains from 11 species: 464 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 306 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 114 strains of streptococcus pyogenes, 37 strains of branhamella catarrhalis, 329 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 32 strains of escherichia coli, 66 strains of  klebsiella pneumoniae, 26 strains of enterobacter cloacae, 20 strains of serratia marcescens, 12 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 42 strains of acinetobacter  calcoaceticus, isolated from the throat swab and the sputum of 2,539 patients with respiratory infections who visited 21 private clinics in tohoku district of  japan during the period from january to april in 1989. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were more active against s. aureus, b. catarrhalis, p. aeruginosa and a. calcoaceticus than other antibiotics. ampicillin and cefteram were more active against s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes than other antibiotics. new-quinolones and  cephems of new-generation were active against h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae and s. marcescens. of 30 strains of s. aureus which were resistant (mic greater than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml) to ampicillin, only one strain was resistant (mic greater than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml) to methicillin. twenty strains (6.5%) of s. pneumoniae and 49 strains (14.9%) of h.  influenzae were resistant (mic greater than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml) to ampicillin. of 101 strains of h. influenzae of which their beta-lactamase activity was determined by nitrocephin-method, 27 (26.7%) were beta-lactamase-positive strains. the above results indicated that mrsa is only rarely found in primary care clinics but the incidence of ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae in primary care clinics is almost the same as that of the intensive care clinic, i.e. medical school-affiliated hospitals. therefore caution should be exercised as regards antibiotic resistance of the causative organism even in primary care clinics.

TI  == use of potentially infected donor hearts for cardiac transplantation.
AB  == despite the nationwide shortage of heart donors, more patients, some of whom are  critically ill, are being accepted as candidates for transplantation. thus, on occasion, we have liberalized our donor criteria to meet the demand. we have recently transplanted 16 potentially infected donor hearts into critically ill recipients. of these 16 donors, 7 had multiple positive blood cultures as follows: streptococcus pneumoniae (3), staphylococcus aureus (2), klebsiella pneumoniae (1), and enterobacter sp (1). seven other donors were accepted despite high fevers (rectal temperature greater than 38.9 degrees c), leukocytosis (greater than 18 x 10(9)/l [greater than 18,000 cells/microl]), and pulmonary infiltrates with positive sputa (enterobacter [3], klebsiella pneumoniae [2], and staphylococcus [2]). two other donors with hepatitis b surface antigen positivity were deemed at high risk but were used because the recipients were in immediate need. early mortality (less than or equal to 30 days) among the recipients was 3/16 (18.7%) with 1 patient dying of uncontrolled allograft rejection, 1 of hepatic failure, and 1 of pseudomonas septicemia. late mortality (greater than 30 days after operation) occurred in 6 patients: 2 patients died of hepatic failure, 3 died of graft atherosclerosis, and 1 died of iatrogenic hemorrhage after a liver biopsy. only 1 patient died of infection unrelated to that of the donor, and the other patients had no infectious complications resulting from the organisms identified in their respective donors. use of potentially infected donor hearts resulted in surprisingly few infectious complications in this group  of recipients. this practice can be safe and should be considered when other options are unavailable.

AB  == the microbiology of empyema was studied in 72 children and adolescents whose specimens yielded bacterial growth after inoculation for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. a total of 93 organisms, 60 aerobic or facultative and 33 anaerobic, were isolated. aerobic bacteria was isolated in 48 (67%) patients, anaerobic bacteria in 17 (24%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 7 (10%). the predominant aerobic or facultative bacteria were haemophilus influenzae (15 isolates), streptococcus pneumoniae (13), and staphylococcus aureus (10). the predominant anaerobes were bacteroides sp (15 isolates, including 7 bacteroides fragilis group and 5 bacteroides melaninogenicus group), anaerobic cocci (9), and fusobacterium sp (6). beta-lactamase activity was detected in at least one isolate in 20 (37%) of the 54 tested patients. these included all 8 tested s aureus and 7 b fragilis group, 3 of 10 h influenzae, 2 of 4 b melaninogenicus group, and 1 of 2 klebsiella pneumoniae. most cases of s pneumoniae and h influenzae were associated with pneumonia. the recovery of anaerobic bacteria was mostly associated with the concomitant diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia, lung abscess, subdiaphragmatic abscess, and abscesses of dental or oropharyngeal origin. the data highlight the importance of anaerobic bacteria in selected cases of empyema in children and adolescents.

TI  == serious pediatric infections.
AB  == third-generation cephalosporins are important additions to the range of antibiotics available for treating children with serious bacterial infections. they are highly active against the common pathogens, which cause bacterial meningitis in children. strains of haemophilus influenzae type b resistant to both ampicillin and chloramphenicol, and streptococcus pneumoniae relatively resistant to penicillin remain susceptible to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter diversus, as well as the other more common gram-negative bacilli isolated from neonates and children are susceptible to these agents. however, listeria monocytogenes is not cephalosporin-sensitive. ceftazidime is the only third-generation cephalosporin useful for treating serious infections due to pseudomonas aeruginosa in children. as with other beta-lactam antibiotics, the clearance of cephalosporins is prolonged in neonates, particularly premature babies. cefotaxime and ceftriaxone  are equivalent to ampicillin and chloramphenicol for the treatment of bacterial meningitis in children over two to three months of age with respect to neurologic outcome and safety, despite the in vitro activity of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone being much greater than the standard antibiotics for the meningeal pathogens. cefotaxime and ceftriaxone are effective in the treatment of serious gram-negative infections in children. in many instances, ceftriaxone can be administered once daily, which allows for more convenient therapy, particularly on an outpatient basis. although controversial, ceftazidime has been used as single-agent therapy for empiric treatment of neutropenic immunocompromised children with fever.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activities of a new quinolone, win 57273, possessing potent  activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of a new 7-dimethylpyridinyl quinolone, win 57273, was assessed by using in vitro and in vivo models. agar inclusion and broth dilution  in vitro tests revealed broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms, with the greatest potency observed against the  staphylococci. the mic for 90% of coagulase-positive strains tested (mic90) was less than or equal to 0.002 micrograms/ml; for the coagulase-negative strains the mic90 was 0.008 micrograms/ml. against enterococci the mic90 was 0.06 micrograms/ml, with comparable activity observed against group a and group b streptococci as well as against the pneumococci. in general, the mic90s for the gram-negative bacteria were less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. exceptions were serratia marcescens (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml), citrobacter freundii (mic90,  4 micrograms/ml), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). the greatest potency was observed against haemophilus spp. and neisseria spp., with mic90s of 0.06 and 0.016 micrograms/ml, respectively. broad-spectrum activity was also observed against anaerobes, with mic90s ranging from 0.125 to 0.5 micrograms/ml among the species tested. the in vivo efficacy was determined by using a murine model by calculating the 50% protective doses against a lethal bacterial infection caused by strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the staphylocci were most susceptible, with 50% protective doses for  all strains ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 mg/kg. with the exception of the pseudomonas  infection, which was refractory to treatment, animals that were part of the other infection models responded to less than 10 mg/kg. equivalent activity was seen with the subcutaneous or the oral route of drug administration. win 57273 was significantly more potent than ciprofloxacin in treating gram-positive bacterial  infections (2- to 20-fold) but was significantly less effective at treating gram-negative bacterial infections (30- to 300-fold).

TI  == the antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the blood of patients in st  thomas' hospital, 1969-1988.
AB  == we have monitored the antibiotic sensitivity of bloodstream isolates of common bacteria over a period of 20 years. among the gram-positive bacteria, the proportion of isolates of staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, erythromycin, fusidate, or gentamicin has increased marginally, while that of coagulase-negative staphylococci (mostly staph. epidermidis) has increased markedly. enterococci are becoming serially more resistant to high concentrations of aminoglycosides. the enterobacteriaceae have become considerably less sensitive to ampicillin (and amoxycillin) and trimethoprim but more sensitive to  the aminoglycosides, whilst their susceptibility to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, imipenem, meropenem and temocillin has remained constant. we have some evidence that in-vitro resistance is clinically relevant since the mortality rate rises if inappropriate antibiotics are used empirically. although  many drug regimens could be used, we are able to recommend initial therapy with a combination of gentamicin and cefuroxime for most of our patients, the exceptions being those known to be infected with resistant organisms before the onset of septicaemia.

AB  == the bacteriology of the isolates from the sputum or the throat swab of patients with respiratory infections visiting a doctor in private practice in sendai city  during the period from march in 1988 to february in 1989 was documented, and their sensitivity to 45 antimicrobial agents was determined. of the 568 patients, 514 cases had acute pharyngitis, 8 cases each had acute tonsillitis and acute bronchitis, 7 cases were acute pneumonia, 6 cases had herpangina, 18 cases had hand-foot-mouth disease with the signs of respiratory infections, 5 cases had varicella with the signs of respiratory infections and 2 cases were mumps with the signs of respiratory infections. three hundred strains of potential (greater  than or equal to 10(7) cfu/ml) pathogens were recovered from 293 of the 568 cases, which consisted of 124 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 58 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 45 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 26 strains of branhamella catarrhalis, 25 strains of streptococcus pyogenes, 9 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and 13 strains of other species, not including non-fermentile gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. staphylococcus aureus and other strains were documented simultaneously in 6 out of 7 cases in which multi-organisms were recovered. many strains of staphylococcus aureus were isolated from young patients throughout the year. on the other hand many strains of branhamella catarrhalis were isolated from elderly patients in winter. the sensitivity of 45  antimicrobial agents of 231 of 300 strains was determined by sensitivity disks (eiken, japan). no strain of the haemophilus influenzae in this study was resistant to ampicillin. none of the streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes was resistant to ampicillin or cefazolin. none of the staphylococcus aureus was resistant to cloxacillin, cefazolin, gentamicin or ofloxacin. we conclude from the above results that antibiotic-resistant strains are found presumably only in a very few cases in primary care clinic.

TI  == bacteria causing respiratory infections in children and their sensitivity to antibiotics.
AB  == the author lists the most frequent bacterial agents isolated from the nose and pharynx samples of children that visited the child health centre from 1983 to 1986. the gram-positive bacteria found most often were: staphylococcus aureus (44% in 1983, 40% in 1986). streptococcus pneumoniae (6% in 1983, 12% in 1986), and streptococcus haemolyticus of group "a" (14% in 1983, 19% in 1986). the isolated gram-negative bacteria were: e. coli (14%), klebsiella enterobacter (8%), and proteus species and pseudomonas aeruginosa (2 to 4% [4, 6, 7, 16]). according to the author's analyses staphylococcus aureus is highly sensitive to cloxacilline (96%, no changes in the 4-year period), then to sulphametoxasol-trimetropin (95%), to lincomycine (85% no change), while to penicillin it is entirely resistant. streptococcus pneumoniae proved sensitive to ampicillin, lincocine and erythromycin (96%), to cephalosporins (83%) and to sulphamides (85%). streptococcus haemolyticus from group "a" reacted to penicillin excellently. the greatest sensitivity to gram-negative bacteria e. coli related to aminoglycosides (97%), sulphonamides (96%), chloramphenicol (91%), and to cephalosporines (90%, in 1986 only 60%). klebsiella enterobacter reacted to aminoglycosides (97%), sulphonamides (92%) and chloramphenicol (83%) and pseudomonas to aminoglycosides (95%), gentamycin (92%), while to cephalosporines and ampicillin preparations it proved totally resistant.

TI  == antibacterial activity of rosin and resin acids in vitro.
AB  == the antibacterial effects of rosins and resin acids were studied in vitro using three methods, disc diffusion on agar, agar dilution, and broth dilution. rosin and some resin acids had antibacterial effects that were restricted to gram-positive bacteria. the abietic type of acids had a more pronounced antibacterial activity than the pimaric and labdane acids when the disc diffusion method was used but there was no inhibition of growth of gram-negative bacteria.  among the individual resin acids, dehydroabietic acid was generally the most potent, when disc diffusion on agar was used, and prediffusion increased the inhibitory effect. the composition of the pure resin acids dehydroabietic, neoabietic, and isopimaric acid did not change during the experiment, but abietic and levopimaric acid were converted into dehydroabietic acid by the addition of muller-hinton agar. in conclusion the old tradition of treating wounds with pitch, sap, rosin, or rosin containing tapes might therefore have some antibacterial relevance.

TI  == overview of experience with ofloxacin in respiratory tract infection.
AB  == ofloxacin is highly active against common respiratory pathogens including haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis and has clinically applicable  activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas  aeruginosa. sputum, lung tissue and bronchial mucosal concentrations of ofloxacin equal or, in most cases significantly exceed the mics of such pathogens. these in vitro attributes are reflected in the results of the worldwide ofloxacin clinical trial program which achieved overall response rates of 98% in lower respiratory tract infections, 83% in pneumonias and 87% to 95%, in open and comparative studies respectively, in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis  (cb). overall bacterial eradication rates ranged from 70% for pneumococci and 84.5% for b. catarrhalis to 88.5% for h. influenzae. in lower respiratory infection ofloxacin gave equal or superior clinical results to amoxycillin or erythromycin therapy together with an overall bacterial eradication rate of 100%. clinical results comparable with standard agents were also obtained in pneumonia, cure rates ranging from 77-89% at various dosages. eradication rates proved greatest for h. influenzae (92%) and were satisfactory for klebsiella spp. (80%), although less so for pneumococci (73%). bacteriological eradication rates in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis ranged from 68% for pneumococcal infections, to 85% in b. catarrhalis and 94% in h. influenzae infections. ofloxacin compared favourably with pivampicillin, co-trimoxazole and doxycycline  clinically. a daily oral ofloxacin dose of 400 mg produced a good clinical response in 92% of patients or more. the available clinical data therefore substantially confirm the claim of ofloxacin to offer an effective alternative in many forms of acute bacterial respiratory infection, especially where h. influenzae and b. catarrhalis are involved.

AB  == measurement of killing kinetics of azithromycin against strains of streptococcus  pneumoniae and klebsiella pneumoniae in vitro showed that it had a limited bactericidal activity (greater than 90% kill) for the first eight hours of incubation, but developed complete bactericidal activity (greater than 99.9% kill) by 24 h incubation. since high and sustained tissue levels of azithromycin  occur in animals and humans, it was proposed that it might produce a bactericidal effect in vivo. this was demonstrated in a lung infection model in mice, designed to mimic the in-vitro killing studies. a 25 mg/kg dose of azithromycin given 24 h before intranasal challenge reduced the recoverable str. pneumoniae population by greater than 99.9%, in comparison with untreated controls. erythromycin did not produce a bactericidal effect at 100 mg/kg, and roxithromycin only reduced the viable count by 96%, at a dose of 50 mg/kg. against a k. pneumoniae lung infection, a 50 mg/kg dose of azithromycin reduced the bacterial count by 99%. the bactericidal effect was correlated with lung tissue concentrations of azithromycin. in a proliferating escherichia coli paper disc infection model, extravascular fluid concentrations of azithromycin were correlated with a 99.9% reduction in bacterial count, while corresponding serum concentrations were always less than the mic. dosing with azithromycin eradicated haemophilus influenzae from the bulla (middle ear) of gerbils, as was not the case with erythromycin and roxithromycin. this effect was correlated with the antibiotic concentration in bulla lavage.

AB  == bacterial chemotactic peptides are low molecular weight peptides which stimulate  a wide range of neutrophil functions following binding to specific leucocyte receptors. formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine (fmlp) is the major chemotactic  peptide in escherichia coli culture supernatants. this paper reports the development and validation of a radio-immunoassay (ria) for fmlp and its application to the analysis of formyl peptide production by enteric bacteria in vitro. the assay was moderately sensitive (10 nmol/l fmlp) and highly specific showing cross reactivity with f-met-leu-tyr, f-nle-leu-phe and f-met-met-met sequences (id50 = 200, 100 and 250 nmol/l, respectively) but no significant cross reactivity with non-formylated or other formylated di- and tri-peptides (id50 = 10(5) nmol/l. culture supernatants from five species of enteric bacteria were filtered, concentrated and fractionated by reverse phase high performance liquid  chromatography before ria. all five organisms produced immunoreactive f-met peptides. a major peak of immunoreactivity co-chromatographing with authentic fmlp was found in all supernatants, but additional peaks representing more hydrophobic peptides were found in streptococcus faecalis and bacteroides fragilis cultures. in e. coli culture supernatants, concentration of immunoreactive fmlp increased in a linear fashion during 3 h of log phase growth  reaching 31.2 nmol/l(s.e.m. = 10) with final bacterial concentrations of 3 +/- 0.73 x 10(8)/ml (n = 6). these findings extend earlier work showing production of bioactive formyl oligopeptides by different species of enteric bacteria and suggest that a ria for fmlp will be a useful tool for investigating the production and metabolic fate of such peptides in man.

AB  == since 1981, in cooperation with research institutions across the nation, ikemoto, et al. have been collecting clinical isolates from patients with respiratory tract infections and conducting an annual retrospective survey of patients' background factors and of isolated strains and their sensitivities to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics. in the period from october, 1987 to september, 1988, 17 institutions participated in the survey and a total of 706 strains which were demonstrated to be causative organisms were isolated from 562  patients with respiratory tract infections. strains were mostly isolated from the sputum. the taxonomic breakdown of these strains was: staphylococcus aureus (69 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (120), haemophilus influenzae (170), mucoid-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa (42), non-mucoid-producing p. aeruginosa  (87), escherichia coli (11), klebsiella pneumoniae (35), brahamella catarrharis (72), etc. of these strains, 629 were used to determine mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics for susceptibility analyses. relationships between patient backgrounds and diagnoses and between infections diseases and causative organisms were also investigated. most of the major causative organisms, such as h. influenzae and p. aeruginosa, showed no substantial changes from previous years, with regard to their sensitivities to antibiotic agent, but  s. aureus, particularly methicillin/cephem-resistant strains of s. aureus (mcrsa) showed somewhat lower sensitivity to beta-lactams, and as in recent years, to ofloxacin, a new quinolone drug, as well. regarding background factors of patients, the age distribution was heavily concentrated in age brackets of 50 years and older, thus patients in these age group accounted for 75.2% of all the  patients, which was comparable to 73.5% in 1985 and 77.9% in 1986. among infections encountered, bacterial pneumonia was most frequent at 28.3%, followed  by chronic bronchitis (27.2%) and bronchiectasis (16.0%). bacterial pneumonia was actually the most frequent, throughout the entire age groups accounting for 34.3% of patients up to 29 years, 26.6% in the group of 30-69 years and 30.7% in patients aged 70 years and older. chronic bronchitis was next most frequent and accounted for 20.0%, 26.4% and 30.7% among the three age groups, respectively. breaking down clinical isolates by diagnosis, h. influenzae, s. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa were isolated frequently from most of the infectious diseases.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == the dual-action antibacterial r 23-9424 (desacetylcefotaxime linked to the quinolone fleroxacin) is a new antibacterial agent with excellent in vitro activity. it was evaluated for in vivo efficacy in comparison with the cephalosporin cefotaxime and the quinolone component, fleroxacin. ro 23-9424 demonstrated significant activity against all strains tested in systemic infections, including those strains resistant in vivo to cefotaxime (staphylococcus aureus 753, serratia marcescens sm and pseudomonas aeruginosa 8780) and fleroxacin (streptococcus pneumoniae 6301 and streptococcus pyogenes. in prophylactic studies, ro 23-9424 compared favorably with fleroxacin against escherichia coli and with cefotaxime against s. pyogenes, but ro 23-9424 was considerably more active than cefotaxime against e. coli and more active than fleroxacin against s. pyogenes. in a murine pneumonia model, ro 23-9424 was equivalent in activity to cefotaxime against s. pneumoniae and more active than cefotaxime against klebsiella pneumoniae. fleroxacin was inactive against s. pneumoniae and about 20-fold more active than ro 23-9424 against k. pneumoniae. in a murine meningitis infection caused by s. pneumoniae, ro 23-9424 was 3 times  as active as cefotaxime, while fleroxacin was inactive. when meningitis was induced by k. pneumoniae, ro 23-9424 was as active as the quinolone, while cefotaxime was inactive. in a neutropenic (immunocompromised) model, ro 23-9424 was more active than cefotaxime against p. aeruginosa and 5-fold less active than fleroxacin. in the control normal (immunocompetent) mouse infection, ro 23-9424 was 3-fold more active than cefotaxime, but 10-fold less active than fleroxacin.

TI  == [sepsis at an internal medicine department].
AB  == 185 cases of bacteremia admitted at the internal medicine department of "c.s. virgen de la arrixaga" in murcia from 1977 to 1986, were studied retrospectively. the common infection was significantly associated to staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus a group and neisseria meningitidis and the nosocomial infection was associated to klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens y pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterobacter. we did not find significant differences between the common and nosocomial infection caused by e. coli and proteus mirabilis. these factors were associated  to an increase of mortality: age greater than 40 years, nosocomial infection, pseudomonas aeruginosa, other associated rapidly lethal diseases, acute clinical  state at the beginning of bacteremia, shock and non-correct antibiotic therapy.

TI  == randomized, double-blind comparative study of intravenous ciprofloxacin versus ceftazidime in the treatment of serious infections.
AB  == we compared intravenously administered ciprofloxacin with ceftazidime in a randomized, double-blind study. patients received ciprofloxacin 200 mg intravenously every 12 hours or ceftazidime 2 g intravenously every eight hours,  with placebo infusions to maintain blinding. therapy with metronidazole was added for suspected or documented intra-abdominal infection. thirty-two of the 57 ciprofloxacin-treated patients were evaluable for determination of efficacy and had 41 bacterial isolates from 34 sites. thirty-six of the 56 ceftazidime patients were evaluable for determination of efficacy and had 41 bacterial isolates from 38 sites. seven of 35 bacteremic patients had no identifiable primary focus. the most commonly isolated pathogens were escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and klebsiella pneumoniae. cure  rates and bacteriologic eradication rates were comparable. nine patients did not  improve. patients with treatment failures in the ciprofloxacin group included a quadriplegic patient with relapse of urinary tract infection with bacteremia (k.  pneumoniae). another patient with bacteremia (pseudomonas aeruginosa), pneumonia  (proteus vulgaris), and urinary tract infection (p. vulgaris, providencia sp.) died on the first treatment day. the third patient (s. aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia) had a new aspiration pneumonia develop on the third day; the pneumococcus also persisted. undrained s. pneumoniae empyema caused the fourth ciprofloxacin treatment failure, and the fifth patient had a relapse of s. aureus pneumonia with bacteremia. one ceftazidime-treated patient died of pneumococcal pneumonia on the first day. another had persistent staphylococcus epidermidis and listeria bacteremia despite 48 hours of treatment. two other patients had pneumonia (s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, respectively) and completed  full courses of ceftazidime therapy without improvement. five patients had pneumococcal bacteremia; four patients were cured: one of two patients in the ciprofloxacin group and three of three patients in the ceftazidime group. significant increases in the number of platelets (four patients with ciprofloxacin treatment, one patient with ceftazidime treatment) and declines in  the number of platelets (one patient with ciprofloxacin treatment, one patient with ceftazidime treatment) were observed. intravenously administered ciprofloxacin is comparable with ceftazidime and is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of patients with serious infections, including bacteremia.

TI  == [susceptibility of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1986)].
AB  == enlisting the help of various research institutions across the nation, ikemoto et al. have been pooling cultures of clinical isolates of respiratory tract infections and mapping out the correlations between patient backgrounds and the causative bacteria and the changes in the sensitivity spectra of the bacteria to  various antibacterial and antibiotic agents annually since 1981. the following is a report of the 1986 findings. during the period from september, 1986 to march, 1987, 558 cases of respiratory infections were reported at 17 institutions across the nation and a total of 657 apparent causative strains were isolated from sputum samples. of these strains, 75 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 108 of streptococcus pneumoniae, 150 of haemophilus influenzae, 107 of pseudomonas aeruiginosa (non-mucoid production type), 21 of p. aeruginosa (mucoid production  type), 32 of klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 of escherichia coli, and 55 of branhamella  catarrhalis were subjected to mic determination of various antibacterial and antibiotic agents to map drug sensitivities. in addition, diagnoses, age distributions by diagnoses, frequencies of infectious diseases, types of isolated bacteria, and usage statuses of the antibacterial and antibiotic agents the times of at isolation were also investigated. mic determinations were carried out to investigate susceptibilities of causative organisms of respiratory tract infections to various antibacterial and antibiotic agents. from the 558 cases of  respiratory tract infections, 657 strains were detected at concentrations not less than 10(4-6)/ml and identified to be the causative organisms. of these strains, 603 could be used for mic determination. an overwhelming majority of major causative bacteria, inclusive of h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae, showed sensitivity patterns similar to the sensitivity patterns found a year earlier, p. aeruginosa alone, however, showed some increase in its susceptibility to penicillin and cephem antibiotics. regarding patient backgrounds, the age distribution was heavily biased towards the higher end of the scale, which patients with ages of 50 or higher accounting for 77.9%, compared to 73.5% in 1985. when the patients were classified by diagnoses, chronic bronchitis, bacterial pneumonia and bronchiectasis accounted for the majority of the infections: 28.7%, 23.3%, and 19.0%, respectively. the percentages of chronic bronchitis and bacterial pneumonia 28.7% and 23.3%, respectively, were somewhat higher in 1986 than in 1985. the disease which was comparatively frequent in all  age groups was bronchiectasis, which accounted for 44.0% in patients with ages 29 years or lower, 18.4% in patients between 30 years and 69 years, and 16.7% in patients with ages 70 years or higher. the next most frequent infection was bacterial pneumonia.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == in vitro activities of imipenem/cilastatin (ipm/cs) against 413 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of mics and the results of disk susceptibility tests. the mics were determined using the agar dilution method at  an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. the mic80s of imipenem (ipm) against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were 25 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively, showing a bimodal mic distribution. however, the distribution of mics against other bacteria studied was of monomodal pattern. group a streptococcus, enterococcus faecalis were inhibited by ipm at dose levels less than 0.025 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. ipm inhibited escherichia coli at 0.20 microgram/ml, klebsiella pneumoniae at 0.39 microgram/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one strain showed a mic of 25 micrograms/ml, serratia spp. at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one with mic greater than 100 micrograms/ml, citrobacter freundii at 0.78 microgram/ml and enterobacter spp. at 0.39 microgram/ml. indole (-) proteus and indole (+) proteus were inhibited by this drug at levels of 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. the reliability of the ipm disk diffusion susceptibility test in quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter showa disks containing 30 micrograms antibiotic and  also disks containing 1-30 micrograms prepared in this laboratory. for the interpretation of the showa disk susceptibility test, a 4 category system was used. in the 4 category system for showa ipm disk the following classification of inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed; ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. the results of the test using showa 30 micrograms disk against various clinical isolates were accurately classified into the 4 groups, showing false positive 8 out of 304 strains (2.6%) and false negative 1 of 304 strains (0.3%). with showa 30 micrograms disks subclassification of strains with mic less than 3 micrograms/ml  cannot be achieved. in this study, however, the differentiation of strains with mics less than 1 microgram/ml was made with disks containing 5-10 micrograms, which afforded to set mic break points at 1 and 3 micrograms/ml. according to current concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including the penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except in the hepato-biliary system.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == efficacy of clavulanate-potentiated antibiotics against bacteroides species and artificially associated cultures of aerobes and anaerobes.
AB  == clavulanic acid is known to potentiate the activity of amoxycillin and ticarcillin against beta-lactamase-producing bacteroides species. in order to assess the usefulness of the clavulanate antibiotics in mixed infections with aerobes and anaerobes, artificially associated cultures of clinically significant bacteroides species and facultative anaerobes (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp.) were tested. the minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc) of amoxycillin and ticarcillin, singly and in combination with clavulanate, were determined for the individual species in the associated culture and for the  associated culture as a whole. in the absence of clavulanate, association experiments showed that the mbcs of susceptible strains increased in the presence of beta-lactamase-producing species, whereas the addition of clavulanate to the test systems led to mbcs which were mostly comparable to values as determined in  single strain testing.

TI  == purification, composition, and activity of two bactenecins, antibacterial peptides of bovine neutrophils.
AB  == extracts of granules of bovine neutrophils are known to exhibit a marked antibacterial activity in vitro. by a simple, two-step chromatographic procedure, we have resolved two peptide components of the antibacterial system. they were named bac-5 and bac-7 from the general term bactenecin and had molecular masses of about 5 and 7 kilodaltons, respectively. over 45 and 20% of the amino acid residues in the two bactenecins are proline and arginine, respectively. the remaining amino acids are mainly hydrophobic (isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine). both bac-5 and bac-7 efficiently kill escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, and klebsiella pneumoniae. they also arrest the growth of enterobacter cloacae (mics, 25 to 200 micrograms/ml) but not of proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae (mic, greater than 200 micrograms/ml). finally, bac-7 but not bac-5 has mics of less than or equal to 200 micrograms/ml for pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis. from the comparison between the efficient bactericidal concentrations in vitro and the estimated content of bactenecins in neutrophils (125 ng of bac-5 and bac-7 each per 10(6) cells), it is reasonable to conclude that the two cationic peptides may exert a major role in host defense against at least some microorganisms.

AB  == during the 11 month period up to 30 september 1987, 37 patients (26 male, 11 female, mean age 27 years) with respiratory symptoms who were human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) positive, were studied prospectively on 40 occasions to determine the cause of any pulmonary complications. hiv was heterosexually transmitted. predominant symptoms were cough (89%), fever (89%), weight loss (83%), and dyspnoea (60%). transnasal fibre-optic bronchoscopy (with bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial brushings and transbronchial lung biopsies) was performed on 35 patients, twice on 3 patients. 'tru-cut' lung biopsies were obtained from 2 patients who died before bronchoscopy. pulmonary tuberculosis was the commonest disease, being found in one-third of the patients (12 of 37). mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured from 4; the remainder of the plates were  contaminated. pneumocystis carinii was present in 8 patients: as the sole pathogen in 3, with streptococcus pneumoniae in 4, staphylococcus aureus in 2, and one also had tuberculous lymphadenitis. endobronchial kaposi's sarcoma was seen in 6 of 7 patients with skin nodules. bacterial pathogens isolated included  staph. aureus (5), s. pneumoniae (5), klebsiella pneumoniae (2), haemophilus influenzae (2), h. parainfluenzae (1) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1). invading aspergillus fumigatus was diagnosed by lung biopsy in one. no diagnosis was reached for 8 patients. it is concluded that in central africa pulmonary complications in aids patients are similar to those in europe and north america but the incidence of different pathogens depends on the prevalence of pathogens in the community. m. tuberculosis is probably the commonest pathogen. this study  has confirmed that p. carinii pneumonia does occur, but occurs less frequently.

AB  == pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil (cpdx-pr, cs-807), a newly developed oral cephem, were carried out in the treatment of infectious diseases in the field of pediatrics. 1. since cpdx demonstrates very powerful antimicrobial actions against such gram-negative bacilli as escherichia coli, salmonella sp., klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia sp., such gram-positive cocci as streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-lactamase producing branhamella catarrhalis and haemophilus  influenzae, this drug was thought to be useful for the treatment of pediatric infectious diseases when main causative bacteria in the field of pediatrics were  taken into account. 2. when changes in blood and urine concentrations of cpdx following the administration of this drug at 3.7 mg/kg before meal were determined, cmax and t1/2 were found to be 2.98 micrograms/ml at 2-hour and 1.73  hours, respectively; an urinary excretion rate in the first 6 hours and a maximum urine concentration were 32.5% and 52 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. clinically, 8 of 8 patients with the upper respiratory tract infections (100%), 28 of 29 patients with bronchitis and/or pneumonia (96.6%), 3 of 4 patients with otitis media (75%), 2 of 2 patients with sinusitis (100%), 3 of 3 patients with the skin soft tissue infections (100%), 1 of 1 patient with bacterial enteritis (100%) and 11 of 14 patients with urinary tract infections (78.6%) responded well to the treatment with cpdx-pr, showing a 91.8% efficacy rate in all the patients treated. 4. bacteriologically, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, b. catarrhalis, h. influenzae, e. coli and salmonella typhimurium were all eradicated from 5, 1, 4, 6, 1, 5, 5, 11 and 1 patient, respectively. an eradication rate in all the patients examined was 97.5% (39/40). 5. gastrointestinal symptoms appeared as side effects in 2 of 71 patients (vomiting in 1 and diarrhea in 1), hence, an incidence of side effects was 2.8% (2/71). as for abnormal laboratory findings, eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and increases in got and gpt were observed in 3 of 39 patients examined (7.7%), 1 of 39 patients (2.6%) and 2 of 34 patients (5.9%), respectively. in addition, we also examined the effect of the drug on the hemostatic system, but found no changes upon the treatment. based on these results, it appeared that cpdx-pr was a useful and safe drug in treatment of infectious diseases in the field of pediatrics when administered 2-3 times a day  at a dose of 3-6 mg/kg.

TI  == penetration of newer cephalosporins into cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == a review of the world literature on the penetration (ratio of concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid to concentrations of serum) and attainable antibiotic concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid in humans for cefuroxime, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefmenoxime, cefamandole, cefoperazone, moxalactam, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone indicates that, with the exceptions of cefamandole and cefoperazone, all agents appear equivalent. we conclude that the choice of cephalosporin for the treatment of acute bacterial meningitis should depend mainly on the potency of the agent for the specific meningeal pathogens in question. for the treatment of common meningeal pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis) and for gram-negative bacilli, mainly escherichia coli and klebsiella (excluding pseudomonas aeruginosa), the cefotaxime-ceftriaxone group of cephalosporins has accrued the most clinical experience and the most pharmacokinetic data, while for p. aeruginosa the major interest has centered on ceftazidime.

AB  == antimicrobial activity of julifloricine, an alkaloid isolated from prosopis juliflora, was studied in vitro against 40 microorganisms which included 31 bacteria, two candida species, five dermatophytic fungi and two viruses. significant inhibitory effect was noted against gram positive bacteria. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. citreus, streptococcus pyogenes and sarcina lutea was 1 microgram/ml and against s. faecalis, s. pneumoniae, s. lactis, corynebacterium diphtheriae, c. hofmannii and bacillus subtilis, 5 micrograms/ml. its effect was compared with those of identical concentrations of benzyl penicillin, gentamicin and trimethoprim. the inhibitory effect of julifloricine on gram negative bacteria such as the species of salmonella, shigella, klebsiella, proteus, pseudomonas, enterobacter, aeromonas and vibrio was almost insignificant. julifloricine as compared to micoanzole was found superior against c. tropicalis and responded equally to c. albicans. as compared to econazole, it was found less effective against both c. albicans and c. tropicalis. this alkaloid was found inactive against dermatophytic fungi (up to a dose of 10 micrograms/ml) and viruses which  included herpes simplex 1 and newcastle disease virus. julifloricine up to a doses of 1000 micrograms/25 g of mice was found nonlethal.

AB  == the dependence of the antibacterial activity of the two oral cephalosporins cefixime and cefaclor on pharmacokinetic properties was investigated in an in vitro model using strains of enterobacteria and a streptococcal strain. in the cultures the course of serum concentrations of the respective antibiotic was simulated. the more rapidly attained (1 h) high peak levels (17.5 micrograms/ml)  of cefaclor (500 mg dose) in no case showed an advantage over the more slowly reached (3 h) low peak levels (2.5 micrograms/ml) of cefixime (200 mg dose). cefixime was comparable to cefaclor with respect to its initial killing velocity, whereas it was generally superior with respect to maximum values for reduction of bacterial counts. due to its long elimination half-life (2.5 h) cefixime prevented regrowth for at least twice as long as cefaclor, which has a short half-life (0.7 h). as a result of its antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetic  properties cefixime can be administered less frequently than cefaclor.

TI  == opsonic activity of a new intravenous immunoglobulin preparation: pentaglobin compared with sandoglobulin.
AB  == standard preparations of immunoglobulin for intravenous use consist predominantly of igg (greater than 95%). we have compared the ability of a standard preparation (sandoglobulin) with that of a new preparation (pentaglobin, containing 12% igm and 12% iga) to improve the opsonic activity of antibody-deficient human sera in  vitro. panhypogammaglobulinaemic sera were poorly opsonic for five of six organisms tested, particularly pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and streptococcus pneumoniae, but opsonized staphylococcus aureus almost normally. both immunoglobulin preparations significantly improved the opsonic activity of the antibody-deficient sera for most organisms. the major difference between the  two preparations was the ability of pentaglobin to supply opsonins for p. aeruginosa, e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, while sandogloblin was significantly more potent in opsonins for haemophilus influenzae. pentaglobin demonstrates significant in vitro opsonic activity, particularly for enterobacteria (coliforms) and p. aeruginosa. its content of igm antibodies appears to confer special properties on pentaglobin not seen with standard preparations of immunoglobulin for intravenous use. its place in clinical practice remains to be determined but it may have a possible role in augmenting host defence mechanisms in gram-negative septicaemia.

AB  == to study the mechanism of bacterial opsonization by immune globulin intravenous (igiv) complement consumption and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (pmnl) membrane receptor (fcrlo, cr1, and cr3)-mediated phagocytosis of staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and groups a and b streptococci were examined. igiv alone did not consume complement and showed no opsonic activity by itself for these organisms. when these bacteria were preopsonized in igiv, significant amounts of complement were consumed (44%-94%) and the uptake and killing of bacteria occurred. the in vitro opsonic activity of igiv for these organisms was significantly correlated with the amount of complement consumed by  the igiv-opsonized bacteria (r = .85, p less than .05). the in vivo protective efficacy of igiv also appeared to be directly associated with its ability to activate and consume complement (r = 1.0, p less than .001). antibodies to fcrlo  (leu 11) markedly inhibited phagocytosis of bacteria opsonized in igiv but not that of bacteria opsonized in specific igm. both cr1 and cr3 receptors on pmnls were involved in uptake, but the contribution of each is different with different organisms.

TI  == prophylactic co-trimoxazole versus norfloxacin in neutropenic children--perspective randomized study.
AB  == co-trimoxazole or norfloxacin were randomly administered to 44 granulocytopenic children with malignancies in order to prevent bacterial infections. although more patients in the co-trimoxazole group had febrile episodes (p less than 0.01), the mean of febrile days and the mean of days with systemic antibiotics did not differ significantly in the two groups. five patients in the co-trimoxazole group had a microbiologically documented infection (four with septicemia) due to escherichia coli (n = 2), klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus sp. there were four septicemic episodes in the norfloxacin group due to p. aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus faecalis. compliance was good during administration of both drugs. no signs or symptoms of arthropathy were seen in the norfloxacin group. the number of gram-negative bacilli resistant to co-trimoxazole isolated from stools significantly increased during prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole (p less than 0.001). norfloxacin did not select resistant strains and was very active in eradicating gram-negative bacilli from stools (27.5% of positive cultures).

TI  == a clinical evaluation of sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of pediatric infections.
AB  == we have treated 42 episodes of pediatric infections with sulbactam/ampicillin since 1987. included were 9 cellulitis, 9 urinary tract infections, 5 cervical lymphadenitis, 4 meningitis, 2 thoracic empyema, 2 osteomyelitis, 2 sepsis, 1 furuncle, 1 perianal abscess, 1 dental abscess, 1 peritonsillitis, 1 salmonellosis, 1 shigellosis, 1 peritonitis, 1 suppurative thyroiditis, 1 infective endocarditis. responsible pathogens were escherichia coli in 8, staphylococcus aureus in 6, hemophilus influenzae in 2, streptococcus pneumoniae  in 3, streptococcus viridans in 2, staphylococcus epidermidis in 1, bacteroides fragilis in 1, salmonella d1 in 1, shigella sonnei in 1, klebsiella pneumoniae in 1, enterobacter agglomerans in 1, acinetobacter calcoaceticus in 1, enterobacter  cloacae in 1, group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus in 1, and polymicrobial infection in 4 cases. thirty-nine out of 41 (95%) clinically evaluable patients cured and all (34/34) bacteriologically evaluable patients eradicated their pathogens after treatment with sulbactam/ampicillin. side reactions were seen in  five patients; one maculopapular skin rash, one hemolytic anemia, two diarrhea, and one liver function impairment plus leukopenia. all these reactions were transient and did not require interruption of therapy. these results indicate that sulbactam/ampicillin is safe and effective in the treatment of common pediatric infections beyond the neonatal period.

TI  == [therapy of chronic recurrent respiratory tract infections].
AB  == in 1987, the most frequently identified pathogens in chronic respiratory tract infections in our clinic were haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, branhamella catarrhalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae. recurrent infection is a common phenomenon in patients with chronic respiratory tract infections, including chronic bronchitis, chronic  bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis. h. influenzae is the most common pathogen in such patients. macrolides, tetracyclines and new quinolones were effective to protect against recurrent infection of h. influenzae and these finding suggested  that l-forms of h. influenzae may be significant in the recurrence of infection in patients with chronic respiratory tract infection. bacterial colonization of the oropharynx is the initial event in most lower respiratory tract infections. gargling protects against bacteria colonization of the oropharynx and occurrence  of acute exacerbation.

TI  == role of fluoroquinolones in lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  == oral quinolones such as ciprofloxacin are promising agents in the treatment of serious bronchopulmonary infections due to susceptible gram-negative micro-organisms such as haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, klebsiella pneumoniae and even pseudomonas aeruginosa. their moderative activity  against streptococcus pneumoniae may limit the use of these agents in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and in the empiric management of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. further prospectively designed studies are needed to address this issue. the ability of quinolones to effectively penetrate bronchial mucosa and to be concentrated within macrophages  may afford additional advantage to these agents. they should not be used as a sole agent in the treatment of aspiration pneumonia nor anaerobic pleuropulmonary disease. quinolones are very active in experimental models of legionnaire's disease and deserve further clinical study. ciprofloxacin is a promising alternative to standard parenteral drugs in the management of pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in adults with cystic fibrosis. the potential for drug interactions with theophylline must be kept in mind for patients on both of these drugs.

(ii) of the total aerobic or facultative isolates from the two hospitals, 32.9% (21,510/65,286) were gram positive cocci and bacilli, 67.1% (43,776/65,286) were  gram negative cocci and bacilli. (iii) of these gram-negative bacilli, 65.2% (28,490/43,675) were enterobacteriaceae were enterobacteriaceae and glucose fermentative gram negative bacilli, 32.0% (13,984/43,675) were glucose nonfermentative gram negative bacilli, and 2.7% (1,200/43,675) were fastidious gram negative bacilli. (iv) the more common species among the members of enterobacteriaceae were escherichia coli 35.7% (10,163/28,490), and klebsiella pneumoniae 18.2% (5,186/28,490). the other common species included enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii and proteus vulgaris. the frequencies of salmonella species and shigella species in these two large hospitals were up to 1.6% (456/28,490) and 0.5% (149/28,490), respectively. the most common isolate among other glucose fermentative gram negative bacilli was aeromonas hydrophila 3.0% (843/28,490). the finding of 0.1% (11/28,490) vibrio alginolyticus was considered as clinically significant in taiwan. (v) of these glucose nonfermentative gram negative bacilli, 69.4% (9,704/13,984) were pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18.9% (2,637/13,984) acinetobacter species, 10.8% (1,516/13,984) pseudomonas species.

(vii) of these gram negative cocci, 59.4% (60/101) was neisseria gonorrhoeae and 6.9% (7/101) n. meningitidis. (viii) the more common isolates of gram positive bacilli included bacillus species and corynebacterium species (diphtheroids). (ix) of these gram positive cocci, the isolation rates of staphylococcus species and streptococcus species were 54.6% (10,838/19,827) and 45.4% (9,002/19,847), respectively. the most common isolate among gram positive cocci was staphylococcus aureus, 30.2% (5,994/19,847); the next, enterococcus, 24.9% (4,936/19,847); then s. epidermidis, 22.2% (4,390/19,847). the less common isolates were streptococcus pyogenes 1.1% (212/19,847) and s. pneumoniae, 1.7% (329/19,847).(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == the present study was designed to investigate the effect of membrane proteoglycans (mpg) from klebsiella pneumoniae on the function of human natural killer (nk) cells. mpg combined with bacterial ribosomes from klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae, constitute a bacterial immunomodulator (ms d 53), currently in clinical use. human peripheral blood lymphocytes (pbl) exposed in vitro to mpg or ms d 53 for 20 h showed enhanced nk cytotoxicity. augmentation of nk cytotoxicity depended upon a direct effect on nk cells, inasmuch as these compounds were also  effective on highly purified large granular lymphocytes (lgl). we also studied the effects of mpg on non-cytotoxic functions of nk cells, namely in vitro locomotion and production of il-1. mpg (and ms d 53) induced il-1 release in lgl. moreover, mpg-treated lgl showed enhanced locomotory activity, as assessed by measuring the penetration into nitrocellulose filters. the capacity of mpg (and ms d 53) to activate cytotoxic and noncytotoxic functions of nk cells may contribute to enhancement of nonspecific resistance in vivo after treatment with  this agent.

AB  == fk482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. it displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (cfix), cefaclor (ccl) or cephalexin (cex) against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci including staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the streptococcus group. moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, fk482  had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of cfix but superior to that of ccl or cex. however, it was clearly inferior to cfix in activity against serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. strains of s. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to fk482. all tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ccl and cex were susceptible to fk482, as were all the strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (ampc). fk482, like cfix, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of ccl or cex. the antibacterial activity of fk482 against csh2  strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. fk482 showed higher affinity  for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) (3, 2 and 1) of s. aureus than did cfix, ccl and cex. fk482 also showed very high affinity for the pbps (2 and 3) of e. faecalis and pbps (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of e. coli. the bactericidal activity of fk482 against s. aureus was almost as strong as that of ampc and superior to that of ccl or cex. against gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, fk482 was similar to cfix and superior to ccl and cex in bactericidal activity.

TI  == in vivo antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == the therapeutic activities of orally administered fk482 were compared with those  of reference antibiotics against systemic and local infections with a variety of  bacteria in mice and rabbits. in systemic infections in mice, oral fk482 was almost as effective as oral cefaclor (ccl) and more effective than oral cephalexin (cex) against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis infections. however, fk482 afforded superior protective activity when given subcutaneously against e. coli infection in mice,  and this activity was more potent than that of subcutaneously given ccl. in comparison with ccl, the reason that the in vivo activity of orally given fk482 against mouse systemic infections was weaker than had been anticipated from its potent in vitro activity was due to its poor oral absorption in mice. in local infections in rabbits, a species in which fk482 was better absorbed than in mice, fk482 was more effective than ccl, cex or amoxicillin (ampc). against pneumonia induced by s. aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, fk482 was as effective as ampc and more effective than ccl in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs of infected rabbits. in the oral treatment of experimental ascending pyelonephritis in rabbits, fk482 was superior to ccl and ampc against methicillin-resistant s. aureus infection, as effective as ampc and more effective than ccl against enterococcus faecalis infection, and as effective as cefixime (cfix) and more effective than ccl and ampc against e. coli infection in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the kidneys and urine.

TI  == group b streptococci inhibit the chemotactic activity of the fifth component of complement.
AB  == infection with group b streptococci (gbs) is associated with a poor acute inflammatory response in which neutrophils fail to localize at the site of invasion. in the present studies, we have examined the effects of group b streptococci on c-derived chemotactic activity in human serum. fresh human serum  was activated to form c5a and c5adesarg by incubation with zymosan. the activated serum was then incubated with group b organisms, centrifuged, and the supernatants tested for chemotactic activity for human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. group b organisms caused a dose-dependent decrease in c-dependent chemotactic activity. the degree of inhibition was profound with 1 x 10(9) bacteria/ml (10% of control). experiments indicated that significant chemotactic  factor inactivation occurred within 2 min of exposure to gbs organisms, while maximal inhibition occurred after 30 min incubation. a number of different strains of gbs of types i, ii, and iii possessed inhibitory activity. in contrast, group d streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae failed to inhibit the c-derived chemotactic activity in human serum. group a streptococci that were m protein positive also inactivated c-dependent chemotactic activity in serum, as previously reported. the inhibitory activity of the gbs strains could be abolished by heat or trypsin treatment but not by neuraminidase, pronase, or pepsin. c5a levels in zymosan-activated serum as measured by ria were not decreased after incubation with an inhibitory strain  suggesting that absorption was not involved. sds-page analysis revealed that group b streptococci degrade the c5a molecule, increasing its electrophoretic mobility by removing a fragment with a m.w. of approximately 650 da. thus, one of the reasons for the poor inflammatory response at the site of gbs infection may reside in the ability of these pathogens to inactivate c-derived inflammatory mediators. the gbs c5a-ase activity probably serves as an additional virulence factor for these organisms contributing to the poor inflammatory response characteristic of group b streptococcal infection.

AB  == to interpret of the cefoperazone (cpz) disc susceptibility test, a 4 category system is used in japan, but a 3 category system is used in the u.s.a. and europe. in the 4 category interpretation system of showa cpz disc the following classification is used: ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3 approximately 15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15 approximately 60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. in the 3 category system the classification used is as follows: susceptible mic less than  or equal to 16 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible mic greater than 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, resistant mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, or susceptible mic less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible mic greater than 32 approximately 64 micrograms/ml, resistant mic greater than 64 micrograms/ml, depending on dose levels, 1 or 2 g. reliability of the cpz disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate mics by classifying the test results into 4 categories was studied using discs containing 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 and  75 micrograms. the mics were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. a good negative correlation was observed between  inhibitory zone diameters and mics, showing reliability of the test using these discs. the results obtained with discs containing 30 or 75 micrograms of cpz were well categorized into the 4 groups mentioned above. some strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, however, showed false positive results. when different break points of inhibitory zone diameters than those used for other bacteria were used for p. aeruginosa, and e. faecalis was excluded from the test, an excellent correlations were obtained. with 30 or 75 micrograms discs, it was unable to subclassify strains against which mics of cpz were below 3 micrograms/ml. however, with discs containing 1 to 10 micrograms, it was possible to separate the strains against which mics were less than 0.5 microgram/ml. the fact that most frequent values of mics of cpz against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp., haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes etc. were less than 0.5 microgram/ml supports the usefulness of low dose discs. according to recently ongoing concepts on the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics and their penetration into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding appear to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except into hepatic biliary system.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cefuzonam. evaluation of disc susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  == in vitro activities of cefuzonam (czon) against 273 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of mic's and the results of disc susceptibility test. the mic's were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6)cfu/ml. the mic80's of czon against streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, haemophilus influenzae and citrobacter spp. were less than 0.20 microgram/ml. the mic80's against serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes were both 6.25 micrograms/ml, and that against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 100 micrograms/ml. the mic80's against staphy-lococcus epidermidis were 25 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. approximately 70% of strains of s. aureus were inhibited at concentrations less than 1.56 microgram/ml. for the interpretation of the czon showa 30 micrograms disc susceptibility test a 4 category system was used. in the 4 category system for showa disc containing czon, the following classification inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed: ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic less than 60 micrograms/ml. reliability of the czon  disc tests in estimating approximate mic values was studied using showa 30 micrograms discs and discs prepared in this laboratory containing 1-10 micrograms czon. a good negative correlation was observed between inhibitory zone diameters  and mic's, showing the reliability of the disc method. the results of the test using showa 30 micrograms disc against various clinical isolates were accurately  classified into the 4 groups except those against p. aeruginosa. some strains of  p. aeuruginosa showed false positive results, exhibiting relatively larger inhibitory zone diameters compared with mic's against these organisms. as czon is not effective against p. aeruginosa a much better overall correlation between mic's and the disc test would result when p. aeruginosa was excluded. with showa  30 micrograms discs of various cephalosporins, sub-classification of strains with mic less than 3 micrograms/ml cannot be achieved. in this study, however, it was  demonstrated that differentiation of strains with mic's less than 0.5-1.56 micrograms/ml was possible when discs containing 1-10 micrograms of czon were used. according to recent concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including  penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding  of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in  the body.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of sultamicillin against clinical isolates from upper respiratory tract infections].
AB  == sultamicillin (sbtpc) is a mutual prodrug in which ampicillin (abpc) and a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor sulbactam (sbt) are ester-bound in an equimolar ratio. sbtpc is hydrolyzed during absorption after oral administration to provide abpc and sbt for systemic circulation. in the present study, the antimicrobial activities of sbtpc against 50 isolates each of 6 species (staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes) of bacteria freshly obtained from upper respiratory tract infections were examined in relation to their bacterial beta-lactamase producing abilities. beta-lactamase producing strains were identified using the acidometry disc method with benzylpenicillin (pcg) of cefazolin (cez) as a substrate, and their frequencies of appearance were calculated as follows: s. aureus 86%; k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae 100%; b. catarrhalis 68%; h. influenzae 24%. fourteen per cent of s. aureus strains examined were beta-lactamase positive using both pcg and cez acidometry discs. sbtpc, however, demonstrated excellent antimicrobial activities even against these beta-lactamase producing strains. good activities were observed especially against those bacterial strains producing penicillinase (pcase). average mic80 values of sbtpc were 3.13 micrograms/ml for s. aureus and  k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, 0.39 micrograms/ml for b. catarrhalis and h. influenzae, 0.05 micrograms/ml for s. pneumoniae and 0.025 micrograms/ml for s. pyogenes. as sbtpc was shown to possess excellent antimicrobial activities against pcase producing strains, the enhancement in activities of sbtpc compared  to abpc alone can be attributed to the inhibition of beta-lactamase by sbt which, as noted above, is a component of sbtpc in an equimolar ratio to abpc.

TI  == many pulmonary pathogenic bacteria bind specifically to the carbohydrate sequence galnac beta 1-4gal found in some glycolipids.
AB  == pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death from infectious disease in the united states. to examine the possible role of carbohydrates as adhesion receptors for infection, several pulmonary pathogenic bacteria were studied for binding to glycosphingolipids. radiolabeled bacteria were layered on thin-layer chromatograms of separated glycosphingolipids, and bound bacteria were detected by autoradiography. the classic triad of infectious bacteria found in cystic fibrosis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus, along with other bacteria commonly implicated in typical pneumonia, such  as streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and certain escherichia coli, bind specifically to fucosylasialo-gm1 (fuc alpha 1-2gal beta 1-3galnac beta 1-4gal beta 1-4cer), asialo-gm1 (gal beta 1-3galnac beta 1-4gal beta-1-4galc beta 1-1cer), and asialo-gm2 (galnac beta 1-4gal beta 1-4glc beta 1-1cer). bacteria maintained in nutrient medium bind better than the same cells suspended in buffer. they do not bind to galactosylceramide, glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, trihexosylceramide, globoside, paragloboside, forssman glycosphingolipid, or several other glycosphingolipids tested, including the gangliosides gm1, gm2, gm3, gd1a, gd1b, gt1b, and cad. the finding that these pathogens do not bind to lactosylceramide suggests that beta 1-4-linked galnac, which is positioned internally in fucosylasialo-gm1 and asialo-gm1 and terminally in asialo-gm2, is required for binding. beta-n-acetylgalactosamine itself, however, is not sufficient for binding, as the bacteria did not bind to globoside, which contains the terminal sequence galnac beta 1-3gal. these data suggest that these bacteria require at least terminal or internal galnac beta 1-4gal sequences unsubstituted with sialyl residues for binding. other bacteria,  including mycoplasma pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, salmonella species, and  some e. coli, do not bind to the galnac beta 1-4gal sequence. the biological relevance of these data is suggested by our finding that substantial amounts of asialo-gm1 occur in human lung tissue.

AB  == bacteria contaminating amniotic fluid have anecdotally been shown to produce a phosphatidylglycerol-like substance, thus giving false positive tests for phosphatidylglycerol in vaginal pool fluid from patients with premature rupture of the membranes. isolates of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter  calcoaceticus, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus) were grown in broth and analyzed for the presence of phosphatidylglycerol-like material by one-dimensional thin-layer chromatography and also by a polyclonal, immunologic slide agglutination test (amniostat-flm). all species demonstrated a positive test result for phosphatidylglycerol by either thin-layer chromatography, slide agglutination, or both. the material migrated separately from cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine as determined by chromatography, but identically with the phosphatidylglycerol control. gram-negative species were more strongly positive than gram-positive organisms. colony counts on the order of 10(8) colony-forming units per milliliter were necessary to give positive test results for phosphatidylglycerol. the possible clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

TI  == inactivation of bacteria by purogene.
AB  == the bacteriocidal efficacy of purogene, a stabilized aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide (clo2) was examined using bacteria of concern to public health. the organisms tested were: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, yersinia enterocolitica, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes group a, salmonella typhimurium and bacillus subtilis. the test organisms responded differently to inactivation by purogene. at least a 4 log reduction in bacterial counts was noted when purogene was applied at a concentration of 0.75 mg/l. since purogene is a stabilized complex, it was necessary to provide a chemical environment suitable for the release of clo2 in this solution. this was done by varying the ph of purogene from 3.5 to 8.6 (ph of purogene is 8.6) while keeping the ph of the experimental medium constant (ph 7.0). the results showed that purogene was most efficacious at the lowest ph tested (ph 3.5). this indicates that as chlorine dioxide solutions were reduced to chlorite (which predominates at ph 8.6), their bacteriocidal efficacy was reduced, suggesting free chlorine dioxide  as the active disinfecting species.

TI  == bacterial species-dependent inhibition of human granulocyte elastase.
AB  == lung infection with streptococcus pneumoniae causes the recruitment of many granulocytes (pmn) to the alveoli, but little damage to lung structure ensues, as opposed to infections with other bacterial species that induce a similar pmn response and cause lung damage. elastase, a proteolytic enzyme of pmn, has been implicated as an agent of lung injury. we studied the interaction of different bacterial species with human pmn in vitro to determine if pmn elastase activity is affected by the species of bacteria ingested. pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and s. pneumoniae were grown, opsonized, and incubated with human pmn. after 1 h of incubation, intracellular and extracellular elastase activity was measured. s. pneumoniae reduced pmn elastase activity by 48%, whereas the other 3 species tested had only minimal effects on elastase activity. loss of elastase activity occurred with s. pneumoniae: pmn ratios as low as 2:1. adherence or ingestion of bacteria by the pmn was necessary for the decrease in elastase activity to occur; interventions that decreased phagocytosis, such as not opsonizing the bacteria, pretreatment of the pmn with cytochalasin b, and separation of bacteria from pmn by 0.22-mu filters, increased elastase activity. elisa and western blot analysis of elastase levels in these experiments suggested that normal amounts of elastase were present. thus, the loss of elastase activity we observed may be due to an elastase inhibitor present in s. pneumoniae.

AB  == ciprofloxacin is a new quinolone antimicrobial agent with activity against a broad spectrum of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, including pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci. the efficacy and safety results of 80 clinical studies of the oral form of ciprofloxacin are reported. drug safety was assessed in 2236 courses in 2203 adult patients treated primarily in the united states. data from 1676 courses were suitable for analysis of drug efficacy. the unit dose for most patients ranged from 250 mg to 750 mg (median, 500 mg), usually given every 12 hours. the  duration of treatment ranged from 3 to 231 days (median, 10 days). predominant among 1722 infections were those of the urinary tract (43%), skin structures (29%), and respiratory tract (19%); the remainder were bone and joint infections  (5%), bacteremias (2%), and intra-abdominal (1%), gastrointestinal (1%), and pelvic infections (less than 1%). signs and symptoms of infection resolved in 79% of all cases; a further 15% improved, and 5% failed to improve. pathogens were eradicated in 89% of urinary tract infections and persisted in 5%; 80% of patients still had sterile urine at the 3-to 6-week follow-up. in 81% of nonurinary tract infections, pathogens were eradicated; they persisted in 11%, and superinfection occurred in less than 5%. after treatment, 89% of the 2253 causative organisms were eradicated and 2% were reduced to clinically insignificant counts; 8% persisted. of 411 isolates of p. aeruginosa, 77% were eradicated, as were 97% of 421 escherichia coli and 80% of 248 staphylococcus aureus isolates. also eradicated were 95% of 166 klebsiella, 96% of 139 proteus mirabilis, 100% of 20 other proteus, 94% of 123 enterobacter, 100% of 68 haemophilus influenzae, 96% of 49 citrobacter, 89% of 45 serratia, 95% of 41 streptococcus pneumoniae, 91% of 43 salmonella, 100% of 38 morganella morganii, and 100% of 35 providencia isolates. adverse reactions were judged probably or possibly drug-related in 14.8% of courses; drug treatment had to be stopped prematurely in 3.5%. the most frequent reactions were gastrointestinal complaints (chiefly nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting), metabolic disorders (elevated sgot, sgpt, serum creatinine, or blood urea nitrogen), and nervous system effects (dizziness, light-headedness, restlessness, tremor, and headache). crystalluria,  judged to be related to ciprofloxacin, occurred in two patients.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == the postantibiotic effect (pae) is the suppression of bacterial growth that persists after limited exposure of organisms to antimicrobial agents. we demonstrated and standardized the in vivo pae in a thigh infection model in neutropenic mice. inhibitors of protein and nucleic acid synthesis induced paes of 1.4-7.5 h against aerobic gram-negative bacilli, whereas beta-lactam antibiotics did not induce significant paes. against aerobic gram-positive cocci, cell wall-active agents and inhibitors of protein and nucleic acid synthesis induced paes of 1.2-7.1 h, except for penicillins, which did not induce paes against streptococci. with few exceptions the in vivo pae correlated well with the pae reported in prior in vitro studies. residual drug in thigh tissue did not cause the pae. theoretically, the presence of a pae may allow antimicrobial agents to be given more intermittently without organism regrowth after drug levels fall below the minimal inhibitory concentration.

AB  == collaborated studies on species of respiratory tract infection (rti)-related organisms for their identification and drug susceptibilities have been carried out since 1981 at about 20 centers in japan. on this occasion, the data obtained  between 1982 and 1985 were reanalyzed to determine whether or not drug susceptibilities differed depending upon diseases, from which the organisms were  isolated. the results summarized below were obtained in this study. 1. among staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa examined, differences in drug susceptibilities according to different diseases were found among s. aureus and also mucoid strains of p. aeruginosa. 2. susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics was definitely lower in s. aureus strains isolated from pneumonia than in those isolated from chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasia. 3. the isolation frequency of methicillin-and cefazolin-resistant strains of s. aureus was 30.3% and 25.9%, respectively, and was especially high among strains isolated from pneumonia. the antibiotic potency of minocycline against s. aureus, including methicillin resistant s. aureus, was the strongest among 9 drugs examined; s. aureus maintained relatively sufficient sensitivity to dicloxacillin among beta-lactam antibiotics. 4. mucoid producing strains of p. aeruginosa isolated from chronic bronchitis had slightly lower drug susceptibility than those isolated from bronchiectasia. 5. when drug susceptibilities of h. influenzae were compared among groups separated according to diseases using mic50, mic80 and mic90 as indicators, there were no clear differences. the isolation frequency of ampicillin (abpc)-resistant strains, however, was clearly  different among diseases; namely, resistant strains were the most and the least frequently isolated from chronic bronchitis and from pneumonia, respectively. in  addition, the drug susceptibility of h. influenzae isolated in 1985 was analyzed  in relation to the production of beta-lactamase. as a result, it was suspected that some factors, other than beta-lactamase, participated in the mechanism of abpc-resistance. 6. these results suggest that drugs to be used for the chemotherapy of rti should be selected considering the fact that drug susceptibilities of the pathogens differ, even among the same species, according  to diseases.

TI  == growth responses of environmental mastitis pathogens to long-chain fatty acids.
AB  == streptococcus uberis, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae were tested for susceptibility to long-chain fatty acids predominant in teat canal keratin. antibacterial activity of free fatty acids on each bacterial species was measured after 12 h in synthetic media. growth responses of all three strains of streptococcus uberis were completely inhibited by c18:3 and  those of two of three strains by c18:2 at 1 micrograms/ml. none of the fatty acids tested were bactericidal to streptococcus faecalis. saturated fatty acids c14 and c16 were more bacteriostatic to streptococcus faecalis than were polyene  fatty acids. growth responses of coliform species were not affected by long-chain fatty acids. in general, environmental mastitis pathogens were resistant to fatty acids predominant in teat canal keratin.

TI  == tigemonam, an oral monobactam.
AB  == tigemonam is an orally administered monobactam. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml it inhibited the majority of strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter diversus, proteus spp., providencia spp., aeromonas hydrophila, salmonella spp., shigella spp., serratia marcescens,  and yersinia enterocolitica. at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml it inhibited haemophilus spp., neisseria spp., and branhamella catarrhalis. it did not inhibit pseudomonas spp. or acinetobacter spp. tigemonam was more active than cephalexin and amoxicillin-clavulanate and inhibited many members of the family enterobacteriaceae resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and gentamicin. some enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii strains resistant to aminothiazole iminomethoxy cephalosporins and aztreonam were resistant to tigemonam. the mic for 90% of hemolytic streptococci of groups a, b, and c and for streptococcus pneumoniae was 16 micrograms/ml, but the mic for 90% of enterococci, listeria spp., bacteroides spp., and viridans group streptococci was greater than 64 micrograms/ml. tigemonam was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases such as tem-1 and shv-1 or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of  enterobacter, morganella, pseudomonas, and bacteroides spp. tigemonam inhibited beta-lactamases of e. cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa but did not induce beta-lactamases. the growth medium had a minimal effect on the in vitro activity  of tigemonam, and there was a close agreement between the mics and mbcs.

TI  == management of catheter-related infections in pediatric patients.
AB  == broviac catheters are commonly used to provide parenteral nutrition and access for infusion of blood products and drugs to pediatric patients. sepsis is the most common serious complication of continued catheter use. although removal of the catheter is generally recommended when it becomes contaminated, it may not be feasible to do so without compromising patient care. we evaluated the management  of catheter-related infections in pediatric patients with and without removal of  catheter. seventy-seven episodes of catheter sepsis were evaluated in 61 pediatric patients; 24 were neonates and 37 were older children. the catheters were used for multiple purposes in 75% of cases. the most common microorganisms isolated were staphylococcus epidermidis in 26%, klebsiella pneumoniae in 9%, and streptococcus viridans in 8% of cases; other pathogens included group d enterococcus, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in four older children. thirty-five patients were treated with antibiotics without catheter removal. thirty patients received appropriate antibiotic therapy based on the susceptibility data. twenty-six of these 30 patients responded within 5 days of therapy whereas the others required 15-39 days of treatment. lack of response was mainly associated with the presence of abscess, immunocompromised status, and organisms p. aeruginosa and candida albicans. based on the sensitivity and minimum inhibitory concentration data, a combined regimen of gentamicin and vancomycin would be an effective initial therapy. these findings suggest that (1) catheter sepsis can be managed with appropriate antibiotics, and (2) when continued use of broviac catheter is desired, a trial of antibiotic therapy should be attempted before catheter removal.

TI  == induction of murine b cell proliferation and immunoglobulin synthesis by some bacterial ribosomes.
AB  == ribosomal preparations from klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae were investigated with respect to their activating capacity towards murine lymphoid cells. the proliferation of balb/c spleen cells was induced in a dose-dependent fashion (from 1 to 100 micrograms/ml) by ribosomes of k. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, and s. pyogenes with a peak activity at 48 or 72 hr of culture. the majority of the blast cells induced by these ribosomal preparations were positive for surface-immunoglobulin (s-ig) and negative for thy 1.2. furthermore, k. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, and s. pyogenes ribosomes induced the synthesis of igm and some iga. cell proliferation and induction of igm production were also demonstrated with the 3 ribosomal preparations using spleen cells from athymic nude (nu+/nu+) mice, lyb-5-defective cba/n spleen cells, b cell-enriched and t cell-depleted balb/c spleen cell suspensions, as well as spleen cells from the ips gene-deficient c3h/hej strain. cell culture supernatants contained specific anti-ribosome igm antibodies. antibodies of other specificities (anti-sheep erythrocytes) were also demonstrated in supernatants from k. pneumoniae-stimulated cultures. evidence against a possible role of contamination of k. pneumoniae and h. influenzae ribosomes by lipopolysaccharide- or lipid a-associated proteins in this effect is discussed. ribosomes from s. pneumoniae did not induce 3h-thymidine incorporation nor ig production. none of the 4 ribosomal preparations was found to stimulate t cell blastogenesis or to induce interleukin-2 production by naive balb/c spleen cells. finally, ribosomes from h. influenzae, s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae but not those of k. pneumoniae stimulated  interleukin-1 production by adherent spleen cells, from balb/c mice.

TI  == bmy-28100, a new oral cephalosporin: antimicrobial activity against nearly 7,000  recent clinical isolates, comparative potency with other oral agents, and activity against beta-lactamase producing isolates.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of bmy-28100 was tested against approximately 7,000 bacterial pathogens in a multicenter, multiphased collaborative investigation. the bmy-28100 spectrum and antimicrobial potency was most similar to that of cefaclor and superior to that of cephalexin among currently available cephalosporins. species that had greater than or equal to 90% of clinical strains inhibited by bmy-28100 (less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml) were: citrobacter diversus, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp., branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus supp., streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, serogroup c and g streptococci, listeria monocytogenes and gm-positive anaerobes. bmy-28100 inhibited 9% more of the 6286 fresh clinical isolates at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml than cefaclor at the same concentration. bmy-28100 was generally bactericidal, but mics for some species were markedly increased when an inoculum concentration of 10(7) cfu/ml was used. strains producing plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (tem, oxa, shv, hms) were susceptible to bmy-28100, cefaclor, and cefuroxime. bmy-28100 was less active against strains producing chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases (types i and iv). bmy-28100 was not hydrolyzed significantly by the tested plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but  was destroyed by type i cephalosporinases and klebsiella k1 enzymes.

(2), streptococcus faecalis, serratia sp., klebsiella pneumoniae, achromobacter xylosoxidans, aeromonas hydrophila and pseudomonas fluorescens (1 each). wound cultures failed to predict bone culture results in 12 of 16 patients (75%). nho recurred in 8 of 19 patients (42%) despite intravenously administered antibiotics for greater than 28 days and debridement in 7 of 8 patients. the indolent nature of nho complicates diagnosis, especially  in patients with recent compound fractures. only prompt bone culture can confirm  the presence of nho and reliably guide antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == community-acquired pneumonia: etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
AB  == pneumonia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. a variety of conditions that damage the airways and weaken host defense mechanisms increase the susceptibility of the individual to bacterial colonization of the pulmonary tree. because the clinician frequently cannot determine the etiologic agent, pneumonia is often treated empirically. cefonicid, a long-acting cephalosporin, is a useful and cost-effective antibiotic that is active against many of the common pathogens that cause community-acquired pneumonia, such as streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. it is also active against less common community-acquired pathogens, such as klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and some anaerobic mouth flora. erythromycin is useful when mycoplasma or legionella species are suspected. cefonicid's demonstrated safety and efficacy, its low cost, and its long half-life, permitting once-daily dosing, make this antibiotic an ideal parenteral choice for empiric therapy of community-acquired pneumonia.

TI  == inhibition of human neutrophil elastase by bacterial polyanions.
AB  == we previously demonstrated that pneumococcal extracts contain a highly specific inhibitor of human neutrophil elastase (hne). we now show that the active inhibitor in these extracts is a high-molecular-weight, heat-stable substance that appears to be rna, since inhibitory activity of pneumococcal extracts is decreased by incubation with ribonuclease but not by incubation with deoxyribonuclease or proteinase k. moreover, metabolically labeled ([3h]uridine)  pneumococcal rna, isolated by phenol extraction followed by ethanol precipitation, strongly inhibits hne. pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide, although polyanionic, is only weakly inhibitory toward hne and is not a major source of elastase-inhibitory activity in pneumococcal extracts. on the other hand, the capsule of haemophilus influenzae type b contains polyribosylribitol phosphate. this highly charged polyanion possesses hne-inhibitory activity, but only under special circumstances to be discussed below. pneumococci (type i, type ii smooth, type ii rough) and h. influenzae (type b) all release hne-inhibitory activity into their culture medium during growth. by contrast, klebsiella pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus release little (if any) stable hne-inhibitory activity during growth. we propose that some bacterial pneumonias  may spare host tissue because polyanions released by the invading microorganisms  (e.g. rna from autolysing pneumococci) inhibit elastase released from inflammatory neutrophils and thereby modulate accompanying tissue proteolysis. pneumonias caused by microorganisms that do not release stable polyanionic inhibitors of hne (e.g., staphylococcus and klebsiella) may be correspondingly more injurious to the lung.

AB  == the biochemical basis of immunogenicity to bacterial capsular polysaccharides (pss) has been extensively studied. antibody responses to ps antigens can be greatly affected by their physico-chemical properties, e.g. molecular size, specific determinants, conformation etc. at present, three bacterial ps vaccines, including meningococcal, pneumococcal, and h. influenzae type b, have been licensed in the u.s.a. many other pss, such as group b streptococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella, are still in various stages of vaccine development. studies on the type distribution of pneumococcal isolates from asian populations  showed that the types included in the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine were considerably fewer in asia than that observed in the u.s.a.: the proportion of types was 62.9% in taiwan, 72.9% in japan and 87.9-92.8% in the u.s.a. a large number of pneumococcal types found in taiwan and japan, such as 15a, 23a, 24f and 34, are not present in the pneumococcal vaccine. immunization with one type of group 9 or 19f ps induced a poor antibody response to the other type. all 9n, 9v, 19f and 19a pss are required in the vaccine to induce sufficient antibodies against group 9 and 19 infection. extensive cross-reactions have been found between pneumococcal pss and pss from other bacteria. klebsiella k2 ps could enhance the magnitude of the antibody response to 19f ps. the structure of streptococcal 14636/74 was found to be identical to pneumococcal 19f ps. a difficult problem in the development of vaccines against bacterial diseases is the poor immune response of young children to purified pss. antibodies against the pss can be elicited when ps antigens are conjugated to a protein carrier. in  mice, the maternal immunization with pneumococcal ps during pregnancy or before mating, did not cause suppression or other observable harmful effect, rather it may provide sufficient antibodies for protection against infection during early life.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of tertiary amine covalently bonded to a polystyrene fiber.
AB  == tertiary amine was covalently bonded to a polystyrene fiber and examined for antibacterial activity. the tertiary amine covalently bonded to a polystyrene fiber (taf) showed a high antimicrobial activity against escherichia coli. taf exhibited a stronger antibacterial activity against gram-negative bacteria (e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhimurium, and  serratia marcescens) than against gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis) or candida albicans. this activity against e. coli was accentuated by 0.1% deoxycholate or 10 mg of actinomycin d per ml, to which e. coli is normally not susceptible. this implies that taf causes an increase of  the bacterial outer membrane permeability. on the other hand, the antimicrobial activity was inhibited by adding mg2+ or by lowering the ph. this suggest an electrostatic interaction between the bacterial cell wall and taf. scanning electron microscopy showed that e. coli cells were initially attached to taf, with many projections on the cell surface, but then were apparently lysed after contact for 4 h. taken together, these results imply that bacteria initially interact with taf by an electrostatic force between the anionic bacterial outer membrane and the cationic tertiary amine residues of taf and that longer contact  with taf damages the bacterial outer membrane structure and increases its permeability.

TI  == [susceptibility of bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1985)].
AB  == it has been more than 4 years since third-generation cephems were introduced into clinical practice. the range of our drug selection definitely tends to increase,  because we today have more antibiotics with wider spectrum, antibiotics with strong activities only against gram-negative strains, such as monobactams, and those with tremendously high activities such as quinolone carboxylic acid derivatives, in comparison to those we had in the past. among isolates obtained mainly from sputa of 567 patients with lower respiratory tract infections at 16 institutions throughout japan between september of 1985 and march of 1986, 741 strains were determined to be causative organisms. mic's of various antimicrobial agents were determined against 67 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 100 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 199 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 92 strains of non-mucoid pseudomonas aeruginosa, 40 strains of mucoid p. aeruginosa, 29 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, 10 strains of escherichia coli and for 42 strains of branhamella catarrhalis out of the above 741 strains to determine their drug sensitivities. as for types of lower respiratory tract infections found in 1981--1983, 57.9--64.5% of the infections were chronic respiratory infections; i.e., chronic bronchitis, chronic bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis. these chronic infections, including diffuse panbronchiolitis (dpb), were found in 63.1% of lower respiratory tract infections in 1984. their incidence dropped to 54.0% in 1985, even though dpb was included; i.e., the incidence of chronic bronchiolitis  was 5.5%, that of dpb was 7.1%, and that of bronchial asthma associated with lower respiratory tract infections in 1985 was 8.8% which was twice as much as that found in 1981--1984. although bacterial pneumonia was found in 24.8% of all  the cases in 1981, its incidence was reduced to 11.0% in 1983, 15.1% in 1984, and 17.6% in 1985. this reduction seemed to have resulted from gradual decreases in the occurrence of bacterial pneumonia among the young population. as with usual years, a high incidence rate in a total lower respiratory tract infections in 1985 was found among older patients; namely, 73.5% was at the age of 50 or over (417/567). next, we determined relationships between clinical isolates and isolates from respiratory infections, including chronic bronchitis, chronic bronchiolitis, bronchiectasis and dpb. h. influenzae was isolated from 50.5% of patients with these infections in 1981; however, the detection rate decreased by  about 20% to 29.7% in 1985. p. aeruginosa was consistently isolated, between 24.1% and 30.4% every year.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == deletion analysis of sucrose metabolic genes from a salmonella plasmid cloned in  escherichia coli k12.
AB  == the sucrose operon from pur400, a 78-kbp conjugative salmonella plasmid, was cloned in escherichia coli k12. the operon was located in a 5.7-kbp sali restriction fragment and was subcloned, in each of two possible orientations, using the expression vector puc18. the insert dna was restriction mapped and duplicate restriction sites in the insert and in the polylinker of the vector were used to create various deletions promoter distal in the operon sequence. additional deletions were made with the restriction exonuclease bal31. cells containing hybrid plasmids with specified deletions lacked the ability to transport sucrose or were constitutive for hydrolase and/or uptake activities. the scra (enzyme iiscr) and scrr (regulatory) genes resided within 2900-bp smai-sali dna fragment and were assigned the order scrb, scra, scrr. an amplified sucrose-inducible gene product, mr 68,000, was detected only in the membrane fraction from recombinant cells that contained plasmid with the intact operon sequence. this protein represented 11% of the total membrane protein and was resistant to extraction with 0.5 m sodium chloride, 2% triton x-100, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. the protein did not appear to be the product of either the scra, scrb, or scrr gene and may therefore represent a previously unidentified membrane-bound sucrose protein. a new gene, scrc, is proposed. in addition, the cloned 5.7-kbp sali and 2.5-kbp smai-sali dna fragments failed to hybridize to chromosomal dna from bacillus subtilis, streptococcus lactis, streptococcus mutans, and lactobacillus acidophilus as well as to dna from a sucrose plasmid from salmonella tennessee. however, the probes showed weak homology with a 20-kbp ecori restriction fragment from klebsiella pneumoniae.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo evaluations of bmy-28100, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == a new semisynthetic oral cephalosporin, bmy-28100, was evaluated for in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities in comparison with cefaclor and cephalexin. bmy-28100 showed in vitro activity 3- and 10-fold more potent than that of cefaclor against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively. bmy-28100 was slightly better than cefaclor and about 4 times more  active than cephalexin against haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae.  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis were comparably susceptible to bmy-28100 and cefaclor. the bactericidal activity of bmy-28100 against s. aureus, e. coli and p. mirabilis was equal to or twice as high as mic  value, which was similar to that of cefaclor. the stability of bmy-28100 against  penicillinases was nearly comparable to that of cefaclor, whereas cefaclor was somewhat unstable to cephalosporinases. bmy-28100 was about twice as active as cefaclor against three gram-positive bacterial infections. bmy-28100 was also more potent against infections of h. influenzae and p. mirabilis, but slightly less active against e. coli juhl than cefaclor. blood level parameters of bmy-28100 were significantly superior to those of cefaclor and slightly better than cephalexin in mice and rats. the urinary recovery of bmy-28100 was somewhat  higher and comparable to that of cefaclor and cephalexin, respectively. bmy-28100 was more stable than cefaclor in human and calf sera at 37 degrees c.

TI  == bacteremia in adult men.
AB  == a prospective study was done to characterize positive blood cultures in adult male veterans. the research included 277 patients over a 15-month period. there were 348 organisms isolated, of which 65 percent were pathogens, 6 percent probable pathogens, 4 percent probable contaminants, and 25 percent contaminants. the most common isolates were coagulase-negative staphylococci (23 percent), escherichia coli (12 percent), klebsiella pneumoniae (10 percent), staphylococcus aureus (9 percent), streptococcus pneumoniae (6 percent), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (5 percent). the number of positive blood cultures was significantly greater for pathogens (mean 1.8 bottles) than contaminants (mean 1.2). patients with pathogens were more likely to have hypotension than those with contaminants. at least 40 percent of all patients with a positive blood culture died within 14  days after their first positive culture. the vast majority of bacteremias were community acquired. as lungs and wounds comprised about one half of the sites of  entry for the bacteremias, it appears that more emphasis should be placed on early diagnosis and efficient treatment of infections from these sites to reduce  subsequent mortality.

AB  == the survival and the interactions of selected, hygienically relevant bacterial species in activated carbon filters was investigated. the numbers of escherichia  coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and p. putida increased in previously sterilized filters. after inoculation all bacteria (10(6] were adsorbed. during a period of  6-10 days the filter effluent contained no detectable bacteria. after that the colony numbers increased to a constant level of 10(4)-10(5) colony forming units  (cfu)/ml effluent and 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g activated carbon. klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis died off in the filter system. if the filters were inoculated simultaneously with two species, p. putida and p. aeruginosa remained  at a constant level between 10(4) and 10(5) cfu/ml. e. coli was suppressed by p.  aeruginosa and died off in the presence of p. putida. as in-vitro tests indicated, p. putida did not produce inhibitory substances against p. aeruginosa  or e. coli. on the other hand, p. aeruginosa showed antagonistic activities against e. coli.

AB  == ten patients received a 30-min infusion of amikacin (30 mg/kg) on day 1 and 15 mg/kg on day 2. mean serum creatinine was 1.1 +/- 0.3 (standard deviation) mg/dl  before and 1.0 +/- 0.3 mg/dl 3 days after the second infusion. mean serum amikacin concentrations before, at the end of infusion, and 1, 6, 12, and 24 h after 30 and 15 mg/kg were 0, 157, 79, 31, 16, 5, 5, 85, 51, 19, 12, and 5 mg/liter, respectively. five strains each of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible and resistant to oxacillin, streptococcus  (enterococcus) faecalis, corynebacterium sp. strain jk, listeria monocytogenes, mycobacterium fortuitum (three strains), klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested.  serum bactericidal activities (sbas) were greater than or equal to 1:8 in greater than or equal to 80% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 30 mg/kg and in greater than or  equal to 60% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 15 mg/kg against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible to oxacillin, a. calcoaceticus, and k. pneumoniae. l. monocytogenes, serratia marcescens, and p. aeruginosa had lower sbas. very low or no activity was observed against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and streptococcus faecalis. the study of the killing rate in serum  confirmed these results. postantibiotic effect was studied by incubating a strain from each species in serum samples obtained 1 and 6 h after both regimens for 0.5, 1, or 2 h. the duration of postantibiotic effect depended on the duration of contact and the concentration of amikacin for the following organisms: oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci, l. monocytogenes, p. aeruginosa, a. calcoaceticus, k. pneumoniae, and serratia marcescens. m. fortuitum was killed after 30 min of contact. no postantibiotic effect was observed with streptococcus faecalis, corynebacterium sp. strain jk, or oxacillin-resistant staphylococci. amikacin at 30 mg/kg provided high levels and sbas against susceptible pathogens. prolonged postantibiotic effects were observed. no signs of nephrotoxicity occurred.

AB  == isolates of providencia stuartii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis from urinary-tract infections in spinally-injured patients together with escherichia coli 10418 were challenged with chlorhexidine (200 mg l-1) in a model of a catheterized bladder under conditions which simulate the bladder washout technique. all species survived the antiseptic. organisms growing on the wall of the bladder model appeared to be particularly resistant and electron microscopy showed that these cells were embedded in a protective glycocalyx. the effect of chlorhexidine bladder washouts on the bacterial flora in the urine of patients was also observed and shown to be minimal and temporary. examination of urinary sediments from patients revealed the presence of micro-colonies of bacteria embedded in a polysaccharide matrix. we conclude that bladder washouts with chlorhexidine are not likely to eliminate  established infections with organisms that occur in patients with indwelling bladder catheters.

TI  == post-antibiotic suppressive effect of ciprofloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the post-antibiotic suppressive effect (pae) of different antibacterial agents against gram-positive bacteria has been known since the 1940s. recently, it has been demonstrated that quinolone antimicrobial agents exert a pae against gram-negative bacteria. in this study, the paes of ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus faecalis were determined. the differences in pae determined by three different techniques--filtration, centrifugation, and dilution--were assessed for s. aureus and e. coli. ciprofloxacin had a pae by all three methods, and filtration was used in the majority of studies. a ciprofloxacin concentration of 3 micrograms/ml in mueller-hinton broth, ph 7.4, with two hours of exposure produced a pae of three to four hours for gram-negative bacilli, and 1.9 hours for s. aureus, but had no effect on s. faecalis. exposure of organisms in urine to 300 micrograms/ml of ciprofloxacin for two hours produced a two- to six-hour pae for e. coli, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa, and k. pneumoniae. use of mueller-hinton broth with a  magnesium concentration of 8 mm, ph 5.5, yielded similar results. using human serum, a four-hour pae was found for p. aeruginosa. there was a progressive increase in the pae as the duration of ciprofloxacin exposure was increased from  0.9 hours to three hours. increasing the ciprofloxacin concentration from two to  eight times the minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) for p. aeruginosa or from four to 16 times the mbc for e. coli did not cause a significant difference  in the pae using a two-hour exposure. overall, ciprofloxacin produced an excellent pae for most gram-negative bacteria and for s. aureus, but not for s. faecalis. a pae caused by ciprofloxacin can be demonstrated in broth supplemented with magnesium, in urine, in serum, and in broth with the ph adjusted to an acidic level and with the increased magnesium concentration found in urine. these results support less frequent dosing programs for ciprofloxacin in the treatment  of tissue and urinary infections.

TI  == survival of selected bacterial species in sterilized activated carbon filters and biological activated carbon filters.
AB  == the survival of selected hygienically relevant bacterial species in activated carbon (ac) filters on a bench scale was investigated. the results revealed that  after inoculation of the test strains the previously sterilized ac absorbed all bacteria (10(6) to 10(7)). after a period of 6 to 13 days without countable bacteria in the effluent, the numbers of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and pseudomonas putida increased up to 10(4) to 10(5) cfu/ml of effluent and 10(6) to 10(7) cfu/g of ac. when klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis were used, no growth in filters could be observed. the numbers of e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and p. putida, however, decreased immediately  and showed no regrowth in nonsterile ac from a filter which had been continuously connected to running tap water for 2 months. under these conditions an autochthonous microflora developed on the carbon surface which could be demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy and culturing methods (heterotrophic plate count). these bacteria reduced e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and p. putida densities in the effluent by a factor of more than 10(5) within 1 to 5 days. the  hypothesis that antagonistic substances of the autochthonous microflora were responsible for the elimination of the artificial contamination could not be confirmed because less than 1% of the isolates of the autochthonous microflora were able to produce such substances as indicated by in vitro tests. competition  for limiting nutrients was thought to be the reason for the observed effects.

TI  == a two-center review of bacteremia in the community hospital.
AB  == there are fewer studies on bacteremia coming from the community hospital, where the practicing family physician is likely to see this problem, than from the university hospital. the hypothesis of this study was that patterns of bacteremia would be different between the two types of hospitals. two hundred four patient episodes of culture-proven bacteremia from two analogous community hospitals were reviewed. bacteremia was discovered in 2.6 of 1,000 patients, which is lower than reports from university hospitals. of the 213 organisms isolated, slightly more were gram-negative than gram-positive, whereas many tertiary care centers report  a preponderance of gram-negative organisms. about 20 percent of the episodes of bacteremia ended in death, a rate lower than in many tertiary care centers, and slightly more patients died of gram-negative than gram-positive bacteremia. the most common organisms in descending order were the streptococci and escherichia coli followed by staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus species, and streptococcus pneumoniae. the most common sources of bacteremia were, in decreasing order, urinary tract, source unknown, heart valve, and lung. the most  common underlying disorders were, in decreasing order, malignancy, diabetes mellitus, complicated urinary tract infection, valvular heart disease, and postoperative infection. correctness of treatment of bacteremia appeared to increase survival.

AB  == the distribution of respiratory tract infections (rti) among the general population is not uniform. the incidence in neonates and the elderly (older than  65) is 2 to 3 times higher than that in adults. examinations to determine the responsible pathogen are conducted in less than 1% of cases of rti. the overall incidence of haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae in hospitalized  patients amounts to 13 to 27%. the incidences of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella and pseudomonas aeruginosa in intensive care units are approximately 20% each. the management of the disease should be based on an aetiological diagnosis, and must take the individual patient's condition into account. examination of the sputum or bronchial rinsing fluid is still the most reliable form of diagnosis, however, a sufficient number of quantitative methods must be applied. in hospitalized--and especially intensive care--patients these methods are often successful in isolating h. influenzae and pneumococci which we cannot afford to ignore as pathogens.

TI  == silver-coated nylon fiber as an antibacterial agent.
AB  == a blend of nylon fiber and silver-coated nylon fiber (the latter known as x-static) was used in these experiments. this fiber was bactericidal when bacteria were exposed to it directly or to an extract derived from its prior incubation in salt solution. at ambient temperatures, a rapid exponential decrease of survival occurred, usually after a delay of approximately 1 h. the rate of killing (decrease of survival) increased with an increase in x-static percentage of the fiber blend, temperature of fiber extraction, concentration of  tris buffer present during extraction, and temperature at which bacteria were exposed to the extract. when bacteria were exposed to the extract at 37 degrees c as opposed to ambient temperature, there was no delay in onset of killing. escherichia coli was generally the indicator organism tested, but comparable results were also found for pseudomonas, klebsiella, staphylococcus, and streptococcus species. the rate of killing increased with increasing silver ion concentration of the fiber extract, as determined through atomic absorption spectrophotometry. the rate of killing was greater and the onset was earlier with an extract containing silver ions from fiber than with a salt solution containing the same concentration of silver ions from silver nitrate. studies of the kinetics of ion release suggested that x-static may be an effective, sustained-release antibacterial agent.

AB  == to determine the efficacy of aztreonam in the treatment of spontaneous bacterial  peritonitis in patients with hepatic cirrhosis, 14 patients (7 males, 7 females)  with 16 gram-negative infective episodes (12 escherichia coli and 4 klebsiella pneumoniae) were treated with aztreonam infusions at doses of 1 gm per 8 hr for a planned 14-day period. ages ranged from 40 to 75 years with a mean of 57 +/- 10 years. all organisms were highly susceptible to aztreonam (minimal inhibitory concentration less than or equal to 0.06 to 0.12 micrograms per ml). serum antibiotic levels were 61.9 +/- 25.5 micrograms per ml (peak) and 27 +/- 18.5 micrograms per ml (trough). ascitic fluid antibiotic levels were 33.6 +/- 22.5 micrograms per ml (peak) and 32.7 +/- 16.8 micrograms per ml (trough). although the symptoms of infection were controlled within 3 days and ascitic fluid cultures became negative after 48 hr, 10 patients (62.5%) died, with hepatorenal  syndrome and digestive tract hemorrhage as the principal causes of death. three patients developed streptococcal superinfections during treatment; streptococcus  faecalis peritonitis in one case and spontaneous bacteremia due to streptococcus  equinus and streptococcus mutans in the other two. aztreonam was well tolerated and clinically and bacteriologically efficacious in controlling the infection. serum and ascitic fluid levels were considerably higher than the minimal inhibitory concentration for the causative organisms, suggesting that lower doses may achieve suitable therapeutic levels. a negative aspect of the antibiotic therapy was the superinfections. the high mortality rate was attributable to the  generally poor underlying condition of the patients.

AB  == ceftetrame (ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (ro 15-8074), two new orally administered aminothiazolyl imimomethoxy cephalosporins, inhibited hemolytic streptococci and  streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml but were less active against staphylococci than were cephalexin and cefaclor. they did not inhibit s. faecalis, s. faecium, listeria monocytogenes, corynebacterium jk species, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, including ampicillin-resistant isolates,  were inhibited at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml. both agents inhibited escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, salmonella species, shigella species, citrobacter diversus, and aeromonas hydrophila resistant to ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, although many isolates of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime were not inhibited by these agents. a marked inoculum effect was noted for enterobacteriaceae carrying the richmond-sykes type 1a chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, but plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases did not hydrolyze the compounds. both drugs inhibited the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of e. cloacae, p99.

TI  == growth of environmental mastitis pathogens in various bedding materials.
AB  == the objective of the study was to determine whether, under controlled conditions, bedding materials vary in their ability to support growth of different environmental pathogens independent of the presence of feces, urine, or other contamination. five sterilized bedding materials (fine hardwood chips, recycled dried manure, chopped newspaper, softwood sawdust, and chopped straw) and three bacterial species (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and streptococcus uberis) were used for a total of 15 bedding/bacteria combinations, replicated in  three trials. samples were incubated at 37 degrees c, and bacterial counts were determined over 5 d. rapid growth was seen in straw and recycled manure, some growth occurred in hardwood chips, and a rapid decline in bacterial counts was observed in paper and softwood sawdust. in general, k. pneumoniae and e. coli showed more rapid growth or less rapid decline than did s. uberis. these results  demonstrate that clean, damp bedding may support bacterial growth and suggest that high bacterial counts under barn conditions are influenced by factors more complex than type of bedding used.

AB  == peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from 6 normal subjects were incubated  with 5 polyclonal activators (pokeweed mitogen, epstein-barr virus, group-a streptococcus, staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae. after 7 days of incubation, the supernatants were examined for immunoglobulin (igg and igm) production, the level of a common anti-dna idiotype (16/6 id) and autoantibody activity against ssdna, dsdna, poly(i), poly(dt) and cardiolipin. significantly increased levels of the 16/6 id were recorded only with the klebsiella stimulated mnc. increased immunoglobulin levels and autoantibody reactivity were noted with  all 5 polyclonal activators. the klebsiella cell membrane preparation induced the highest values. no correlation was found between the 16/6 levels, autoantibody activity and the absolute concentrations of igg or igm. this study, together with previous reports, suggests a role for klebsiella in the etiology of autoimmune diseases. we suggest that klebsiella can induce anti-dna-like autoantibodies not  only by polyclonal activation, but also by a more specific stimulus.

TI  == immunocompromised animal models for the study of antibiotic combinations.
AB  == studies of various models of pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in neutropenic animals have demonstrated the superiority of the combination of beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics when compared with a single drug alone. a limited number of studies carried out in models of klebsiella pneumoniae infections in neutropenic animals have shown similar results. the efficacy of double beta-lactam combinations for the treatment of gram-negative bacillary infections  has not been studied as extensively; the few available reports did not show any benefit over a single beta-lactam treatment. most studies of combined therapy in  gram-positive infections have been performed in the experimental endocarditis model. experiments in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus viridans, and streptococcus faecalis endocarditis have shown a clear-cut advantage for combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment over single beta-lactam therapy, as predicted by in vitro tests. the enhanced efficacy of combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment in both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections appears to result in most studies in increased and faster killing of the bacteria. with p. aeruginosa infections, however, experiments in neutropenic mice suggest that in addition to increased killing, the beta-lactam arm of the combined treatment prevents the emergence of the small colony variants that lead to treatment failures during therapy with aminoglycoside alone. for both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections, in vitro tests that demonstrated synergism for the combined antibiotics generally predicted enhanced therapeutic efficacy in vivo. conversely, when no synergism was demonstrated in vitro, there was generally no increased efficacy of combined treatment in vivo. animal models add a dimension to our understanding of the efficacy of antibiotics, both singly and in combination, that is not always apparent from the results of in vitro tests alone. these in vivo tests can be of value when planning clinical trials.

TI  == pneumonia in the elderly.
AB  == pneumonia from bacterial and viral agents is the fourth leading cause of death in persons over age 65, accounting for 169.7 deaths per 100,000 persons per year. this high incidence of infection is the result of aging itself as well as age-related coexisting illnesses and their therapies. these factors combine to affect upper and lower respiratory tract host defenses adversely against invading pathogens. gram-negative colonization of the oropharynx, followed by the spread of bacteria to the tracheobronchial tree, commonly precedes the development of pneumonia. bacterial adherence is one important and modifiable pathogenetic factor that leads to colonization at both of these sites. diagnosis of pneumonia  in the elderly is often thwarted by difficulties in recognizing infection, as signs and symptoms differ from those observed in younger patients. therapy is confounded by the frequent inability to obtain adequate culture material to establish a likely pathogen and by altered drug metabolism. in this instance epidemiologic data may be helpful in guiding therapy. streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common pathogen in community patients, followed by legionella pneumophila and enteric gram-negative bacilli. hospitalized and institutionalized individuals are commonly infected with klebsiella pneumoniae and other enteric gram-negative bacilli, and legionella pneumophila and streptococcus pneumoniae are also found. because recognition of pneumonia may be difficult and therapy is  fraught with problems, mortality is high in the elderly. accordingly, serious attention must be paid to prevention. prophylaxis includes the use of pneumococcal and influenza vaccines as well as careful attention to the patient's host defense status. disease states leading to impairment of the immune system should be sought, and efforts should be made to improve host factors that assist  the individual in removing invading pathogens.

AB  == pefloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. a comparison was made of the in-vitro activity of pefloxacin and that of nine other antibiotics (ampicillin, ticarcillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin, amikacin and norfloxacin). the mic90 of pefloxacin against 500 strains of enterobacteriaceae ranged from 0.25 mg/l (escherichia coli, indole + proteus spp., enterobacter cloacae, salmonella spp. and shigella spp.) to 1 mg/l (klebsiella pneumoniae). pefloxacin inhibited 90% of 52 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa at 2.5 mg/l (range 0.25 mg/l-4 mg/l). the mic90 of pefloxacin against 100 staphylococcus aureus strains (78 oxacillin resistant strains) was 0.4 mg/l (range 0.12-0.5 mg/l). it was markedly less active against streptococcus faecalis and str. pneumoniae (37 strains of each species) the mic90 being 4 mg/l against both species. overall, pefloxacin was at least as active as the third-generation cephalosporins against enterobacteriaceae and was more active than any other antibiotic tested against p. aeruginosa, s. epidermidis, and s. aureus. against e. coli, pefloxacin had a more rapid anti-bacterial activity than piperacillin. a paradoxical effect was observed with pefloxacin. an optimal killing rate was observed at concentrations of pefloxacin compatible with those one can expect in  blood of patients treated with this drug.

AB  == nalidixic and five newer 4-quinolones, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin were tested against 576 recent clinical aerobic bacterial isolates. the 4-quinolones were regularly active (mic90 less than 4 mg/l) against the following bacteria: staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. saprophyticus, different enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, agrobacter spp., aeromonas spp., plesiomonas spp., neisseria meningitidis. other bacteria were usually intermediately susceptible or resistant: different streptococci, listeria monocytogenes, nocardia asteroides, p. maltophilia, achromobacter xylosoxydans and alcaligenes denitrificans. ciprofloxacin was the most potent compound, followed by ofloxacin and pefloxacin, norfloxacin and enoxacin being less active. all the 4-quinolones were much more active than nalidixic acid. the mbc/mic ratios of the 4-quinolones were between 1 and 2 with a majority of strains, and between 2 and 3 with streptococcus agalactiae, str. faecalis and l. monocytogenes. a two- to eight-fold increase of mic was observed by increasing the inoculum 10,000-fold with most of the strains tested. susceptible bacterial population of klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa contained more clones resistant to nalidixic acid (10(4) to 10(8) at four times the mic) than to 4-quinolones (10(5) to 10(9) at four times the mic). supplementing the media with mgso4 produced smaller inhibition zone diameters with a disc diffusion method than those obtained with non-supplemented  agar, with all quinolone or strains. less regular effect, or no effect was obtained after supplementation with znso4 or ca(no3)2.

TI  == [basic and clinical studies on cefotaxime].
AB  == the most frequently encountered infectious disease in the field of internal medicine is respiratory tract infections. one of the most important requirements  for an antibiotic in the treatment of infections is that it must be efficiently transferred to the infected site to attain a high concentration there. in the case of respiratory tract infections, it is desirable for the drug concentration  in the sputum to be higher than the mic for the causative bacterium. cefotaxime (ctx) expresses potent antibacterial activity against haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus pneumoniae, which are the major causative bacteria of respiratory tract infections. ctx also exerts antibacterial effects against a wide range of other bacteria. we administered ctx to patients with respiratory tract infections, then measured and compared the drug concentrations  in the serum and sputum. the results are described below. when 2 g of ctx was drip-infused, the drug concentration in the serum was 113.0 micrograms/ml at 5 minutes after the completion of infusion, 64.9 micrograms/ml at 30 minutes, 38.7  micrograms/ml at 1 hour, 19.0 micrograms/ml at 2 hours, 8.9 micrograms/ml at 4 hours and 3.8 micrograms/ml at 6 hours. the drug concentration in the sputum was  1.29 micrograms/ml at 5 minutes after completion of infusion, 1.54 micrograms/ml  at 5 to 30 minutes, 1.36 micrograms/ml at 30 minutes to 1 hour, 1.47 micrograms/ml at 1 to 2 hours, 1.12 micrograms/ml at 2 to 4 hours and 1.35 micrograms/ml at 4 to 6 hours. the drug concentration in the serum was the highest at 5 minutes after completion of the drip-infusion, and then it gradually decreased.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == from 1940 to 1984, 19 cases of septic dural-sinus thrombosis have been diagnosed  at the massachusetts general hospital, and some 136 cases have been reported from other institutions. septic thrombosis most frequently involves the cavernous sinuses (96 cases). facial or sphenoid air sinus infection often precede cavernous-sinus disease. in addition to the classical signs of proptosis, chemosis, and oculomotor paralysis, isolated sixth-nerve palsy and hypo- or hyperesthesia of the fifth nerve may be found. the major pathogens associated with cavernous-sinus infection include staphylococcus aureus, other gram-positive organisms, and anaerobes. septic lateral-sinus thrombosis (64 cases) is almost exclusively a complication of otitis media and/or mastoid infection. organisms causing this infection include proteus species, escherichia coli, s. aureus, and  anaerobes. septic thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus (23 cases) most frequently accompanies bacterial meningitis or air sinus infection. causative organisms include streptococcus pneumoniae, s. aureus, other streptococci, and klebsiella species. because septic dural-sinus thrombosis is rare, this disease is frequently misdiagnosed. evaluation should include lumbar puncture, air sinus  films, and computed tomographic scan with contrast. other helpful diagnostic tests may include carotid angiography, and dynamic brain scan. orbital venography is the most definitive study in cases of chronic cavernous-sinus thrombosis. therapy should include intravenous antibiotics and early surgical drainage of purulent exudate in the air sinuses or mastoid regions. retrospective analysis suggests that treatment with heparin may reduce mortality in carefully selected cases of septic cavernous-sinus thrombosis. anticoagulation is not recommended in other forms of septic dural-sinus thrombosis. mortality in the antibiotic-era remains high, particularly in patients with septic thrombosis of the cavernous (30%) and superior sagittal (78%) sinuses.

TI  == bacterial colonization of hemasite access devices.
AB  == vascular access ports (hemasites) were recovered from patients in whom they had become foci of infection and were examined according to microbiologic and morphologic techniques. all were covered on their extraluminal surfaces by well-developed biofilms consisting of host material and bacteria and their extracellular products. one hemasite from which staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis were cultured was covered by a biofilm that consisted of coccoid bacterial cells and occasional fungal cells. another hemasite from which  proteus mirabilis was cultured was covered by a polymicrobial biofilm consisting  of at least six morphologically distinct bacterial types and their extracellular  products. this direct observation of the biofilm mode of bacterial growth on these devices suggests that the colonizing organisms will not be completely recovered by routine microbiologic techniques and that bacteria in the biofilm will tend to resist both host clearance mechanisms and antibiotic therapy. removal of the device, with its accretion of bacterial biofilm, should allow the  resolution of the associated infection.

AB  == a-56619 and a-56620 are two new aryl-fluoroquinolones which are as potent as or more potent than norfloxacin when administered orally and subcutaneously in mouse protection tests against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae. a-56619 and a-56620 were more potent than norfloxacin when administered orally against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. a-56620 was as potent or two- to threefold more potent than norfloxacin when administered subcutaneously against members of the family enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. infection with salmonella typhimurium was more effectively treated with a-56619 (50% effective dose [ed50], 1.4 mg/kg per day) than with norfloxacin (ed50, 62.8 mg/kg per day). e. coli or pseudomonas pyelonephritis in mice was more effectively treated with a-56619 or a-56620 than with norfloxacin. after oral treatment, the  ed50s of a-56619 and a-56620 were less than 12.5 mg/kg per day against e. coli and 62.9 and 38 mg/kg per day against p. aeruginosa pyelonephritis, respectively. norfloxacin was ineffective at 200 mg/kg per day against e. coli or p. aeruginosa pyelonephritis. a-56619 and a-56620 were also more potent than norfloxacin in treatment of mixed bacterial pyelonephritis caused by e. coli and streptococcus faecalis. a-56619 was at least 30 times more potent than norfloxacin and a-56620  was 4 to 11 times more potent than norfloxacin when administered against klebsiella pneumonia in mice. a-56619 and a-56620 were at least 2 to 10 times more potent than norfloxacin against staphylococcus aureus infections in immunosuppressed mice. a-56619 was equally potent in all in vivo tests when administered orally or subcutaneously, whereas a-56620 was similar to norfloxacin in being more potent when administered subcutaneously. the peak serum levels after subcutaneous and oral administration of a-56619 and a-56620 were higher than that of norfloxacin. the serum hal-lives of a-56619 and a-56620 after subcutaneous and oral administration were longer than the serum half-life of norfloxacin.

TI  == growth inhibition of environmental mastitis pathogens during physiologic transitions of the bovine mammary gland.
AB  == ten dairy cows were infused intramammarily near drying off with concanavalin a (cona) or phytohemagglutinin (pha). mammary secretions were collected during physiologic transitions of the udder and were used in an in vitro microbiological assay to determine growth inhibition of mastitis pathogens. as mammary involution progressed, in vitro growth inhibition of klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and streptococcus uberis increased. mammary secretions from cona- and pha-treated glands had significantly increased bacterial growth inhibition. secretions contained significantly increased concentrations of lactoferrin and a  decreased citrate:lactoferrin molar ratio earlier in the dry period than did control mammary secretions. greatest bacterial growth inhibition was observed in  mammary secretions obtained 7 days before parturition. however, differences in secretion composition or bacterial growth inhibition were not found between cona- or pha-treated and control udder halves during the prepartum period. bacterial growth inhibition by mammary secretion decreased markedly during early lactation. a highly significant positive correlation was found between bacterial growth inhibition and concentrations of lactoferrin, serum albumin, and immunoglobulin g. a highly significant negative correlation was found in the citrate:lactoferrin molar ratio during early involution and the peripartum period.

TI  == synergy of ciprofloxacin and azlocillin in vitro and in a neutropenic mouse model of infection.
AB  == combinations of ciprofloxacin with azlocillin, piperacillin and ticarcillin were  tested in vitro against clinical isolates. azlocillin plus ciprofloxacin showed synergy against 30% of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates; it was either synergistic or additive against 78% of all isolates tested even those resistant to the beta-lactam. synergism was rarely noted for klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter spp. or branhamella spp. isolates. minimum inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin plus azlocillin, plus piperacillin and plus ticarcillin against pseudomonas spp. were reduced 4 or 2 fold, respectively. however, the combination azlocillin plus ciprofloxacin showed primarily indifference against gram-positive strains. neutropenic mice infected with a lethal challenge of pseudomonas spp. were protected by a combination of azlocillin and ciprofloxacin. its additive and/or synergistic effects and expanded spectrum of activity against streptococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococci and jk corynebacteria may provide an alternative to traditional therapy.

TI  == an analysis of blood culture isolates from 7 south african teaching hospital centres.
AB  == the data on blood culture isolates for 1983 and january - july 1984 reported by the antibiotic study group of south africa have been analysed to determine national and regional prevalences of different micro-organisms and resistance to  certain antibiotics. although there are significant differences in isolation frequencies between the various centres, overall the five most frequent isolates  are staphylococcus aureus (1983 - 15%; 1984 - 14%), escherichia coli (13%), klebsiella spp. (11%; 10%), streptococcus pneumoniae (9%), and salmonella typhi (7%; 13%). staph. aureus ranks first in most centres for 1983 but is displaced in some in 1984 by enteric gram-negative bacilli. in durban s. typhi is the most common isolate for the entire period. methicillin resistance among staph. aureus  is common (approximately 30% overall), especially in the transvaal. gentamicin resistance among certain gram-negative bacilli is a problem in many centres and is especially disturbing in the case of klebsiella spp., of which over 30% of total isolates are resistant. ampicillin resistance for haemophilus influenzae varies from nil to over 30% in different centres, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci are still encountered (nil to over 10%).

TI  == bacteremia following transurethral instrumentation. the predictive value of a serum bactericidal activity test.
AB  == the bacteremic rate following transurethral instrumentation and the possibility of a serum bactericidal activity test to predict which patients that were at an increased risk of developing bacteremia was evaluated. of 33 investigated patients, all elderly men, 14 underwent transurethral prostatic resection, 14 cystoscopy and 5 urethrotomy. none of the patients received prophylactic antibiotic treatment. the majority (97%) of the patients had bacteria isolated from the urinary tract before the instrumentation. gram-positive cocci accounted  for about two thirds (64%) and gram-negative rods for about one third (31%) of all isolates. the most frequent species isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (29%), streptococcus faecalis (19%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (12%). the bacteremic rate was 21%. none of the patients developed septicemia. forty-four per cent of the patients with greater than or equal to 10(5) colony forming units/ml (cfu/ml) in urine developed bacteremia compared with 8% in patients with a sterile urine or less than 10(5) cfu/ml in urine (p less than 0.05). the urethral/prostatic flora was the source of bacteremia in at least one  patient. eighty-one per cent of the isolated strains were serum resistant. about  half (54%) of the gram-negative rods were more or less sensitive against actual,  fresh patient serum. all gram-positive cocci were resistant. there was no difference in the serum sensitivity between bacteria isolated from bacteremic patients and non-bacteremic patients. in conclusion, this study confirmed the relative high risk of developing bacteremia following transurethral instrumentation, especially if the urine is infected.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [infections of the central nervous system in malignant hemopathies].
AB  == central nervous system (cns) infections in immunocompromised hosts are often accompanied by subtle disorders because immunosuppression usually decreases the inflammatory response. cns infections in immunocompromised patients are usually caused by organisms different from those found in the general population. the organism causing cns infection in an immunocompromised host can often be predicted if the type of immune abnormality of the patient is known. the common causes of cns infection in immunocompromised hosts are reviewed here. meningitis  in patients with neutropenia is usually due to enteric gram negative bacilli that live in the patient's own digestive tract. pseudomonas aeruginosa is most common  and is followed by e. coli, klebsiella, enterobacter and proteus. a major risk in patients with abnormal immunoglobulins or splenectomy is infection with encapsulated bacteria, particularly streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and neisseria meningitidis. meningitis caused by any of the encapsulated bacteria can be fulminant. listeria monocytogenes is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in patients with impaired cellular immunity. nocardia asteroides is a leading cause of brain abscess in patients with hematologic malignancy. most patients have evidence of concomitant pulmonary lesions. fungi are among the most common organisms involving the cns in immunocompromised hosts. susceptible patients include those with lymphoma or leukemia and those who receive therapies aimed at suppressing delayed hypersensitivity. cryptococcus neoformans is a common fungal cause of cns infection in immunocompromised hosts. the primary site of infection is the lung.  spread to the cns is via the blood stream. the clinical course is highly variable: meningitis, meningoencephalitis and focal mass lesions. candida causes  meningitis or meningoencephalitis characterized by multiple small abscesses in neutropenic hosts. organisms reach the cns via the blood stream usually from the  digestive tract or infected intravenous catheters. aspergillus causes brain abscess, cerebral infarction and focal meningitis in patients with neutropenia. the primary infection is in the lung. the parasites that infest the cns of immunocompromised patients are usually those that exploit a t-lymphocyte, mononuclear phagocyte host defect. the most common are toxoplasma gondii and strongyloides stercoralis. there have been a few cases of amebiasis with dissemination to the brain in patients with hematologic malignancies. toxoplasma  gondii causes major cns disease in immunocompromised hosts: meningoencephalitis or mass lesions.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == comparative activity of ofloxacin with reference to bacterial strains isolated in in-patients and out-patients.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new quinolone derivative, was compared to that of other agents commonly in use against pathogens isolated in the community  and in the hospital. none of the community or hospital strains isolated from urinary tract infection showed resistance to ofloxacin, while variable resistance was demonstrable with all other oral agents. similar results were obtained with pathogens isolated from infected wounds originating in the community and in the hospital. among pathogens isolated from the respiratory tract, ofloxacin was most active against haemophilus influenzae, but less active than the penicillin-cephalosporin group against streptococcus pneumoniae. ofloxacin was active against all but one (pseudomonas aeruginosa) blood culture isolates. of 112 strains isolated from community-acquired infections, only one strain was ofloxacin-resistant while resistance to sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim, ampicillin and doxycycline was 34%, 42% and 30%, respectively. among 219 pathogens originating from nosocomial infections, 3.2% were resistant to ofloxacin compared to 56% for cefazolin, to 7.2% for cefotaxime, 15.8% for piperacillin and 22.3% for gentamicin. these results suggest that ofloxacin has great therapeutic potential for the therapy of bacterial infections originating both in the community and in the hospital.

TI  == serum bactericidal activity of ceftazidime increased by netilmicin.
AB  == cephalosporins are often used in combination with aminoglycoside antibiotics in the treatment of gram-negative infections. although ceftazidime possesses activity against gram-negative bacteria, especially against pseudomonas, combined use with aminoglycosides is useful. in this study, 12 healthy volunteers (6 men,  6 women; mean age 21.5 yr) received a single dose of ceftazidime 1 g iv and one week later ceftazidime 1 g iv with netilmicin 100 mg iv. both antibiotics were infused over five minutes. concentrations of ceftazidime were determined by high  performance liquid chromatography. serum bactericidal activity (sba) was evaluated against seven microorganisms isolated from clinical specimens. the mean peak serum level of ceftazidime was 113.4 micrograms/ml. at eight hours, we observed a concentration of 2.6 micrograms/ml. the total clearance was 126 ml/min, while the renal clearance was 100 ml/min. ceftazidime exhibited a half-life of 1.9 hours. up to ten hours, the sba of ceftazidime against escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, and salmonella typhi was greater than 1:8 in more than 90 percent of samples. at one hour, ceftazidime exhibited a sba of 1:4 for staphylococcus aureus, and 1:16 for pseudomonas aeruginosa. with the addition of netilmicin, median sba against staph. aureus and p. aeruginosa were 1:32 and 1:64, respectively, at one hour. netilmicin enhanced  the sba of ceftazidime. the combination was not effective against streptococcus faecalis.

TI  == lower respiratory tract infection.
AB  == the most important lower respiratory infection is pneumonia, the fourth leading cause of death. most cases of bronchitis are of viral etiology and are not major  problems. empyema can present an important problem in management. although the diagnosis of pneumonia is usually relatively straightforward, the specific etiologic diagnosis remains a major problem. availability of empyema fluid or a positive blood culture result can be helpful in making the etiologic diagnosis, but these are unavailable in most patients. screening of sputum gram stains under 100 x magnification is very important; there should be fewer than 10 squamous epithelial cells, more than 25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or both per field of this size. the major causes of pneumonia are streptococcus pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, anaerobic bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, various gram-negative aerobic or facultative bacilli and legionella. however, many other organisms are  capable of causing pneumonia, even in the immunocompetent host. further adding to the problem is the fact that a number of different organisms are manifesting increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents. our study with ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid included seven patients with pneumonia, one with empyema, and one with purulent tracheobronchitis. organisms recovered from pleural fluid, transtracheal aspiration and sputum or tracheostomy aspirate included multiple anaerobes, pneumococci, s. aureus, hemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae,  k. ozaenae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, enterobacter cloacae, proteus  mirabilis, beta-hemolytic streptococci, neisseria meningitidis and branhamella catarrhalis. several of the organisms were ticarcillin resistant. eight of the patients had cures and the other patient showed improvement. only minor side-effects were encountered--coombs' positivity (without hemolysis), eosinophilia, drug fever and one case of questionable neutropenia.

AB  == bacterial isolates from the patients with pulmonary infections have been collected over these 3 years, in collaboration with investigators at 13 hospitals in various parts of japan for the study on frequency of isolation of pathogens among the patients and their drug susceptibilities. possible causative pathogens  mainly isolated from sputum in patients with lower respiratory tract infections during period from september 1983 to march 1984, were collected. the frequency of bacterial isolates from the sputum and their drug susceptibility on h. influenzae among the various pathogens are discussed. the kinds of bacterial species isolated from the patients with respiratory tract infections associated with chronic bronchitis, chronic capillary bronchitis or bronchiectasis and their relative frequency of isolation were as follows; total numbers of bacterial isolates collected from various hospitals were 220 strains in 1981, 168 strains 1982 and 258 strains in 1983. h. influenzae was always isolated with highest frequency of 50.5% in 1981, 45.8% in 1982 and 40.7% in 1983, and followed by p. aeruginosa (24.1%), s. aureus (8.2%), s. pneumoniae (7.3%) and k. pneumoniae (5.9%) and e. coli (4.1%) in 1981; p. aeruginosa (30.4%), s. pneumoniae (11.9%),  s. aureus (4.8%), k. pneumoniae (3.0%) and e. coli (1.8%) in 1982; p. aeruginosa  (26.7%), s. pneumoniae (10.1%), s. aureus (7.8%), k. pneumoniae (3.5%) and e. coli (3.5%) in 1983. the drug susceptibility test of h. influenzae to ampicillin  (abpc), piperacillin (pipc), mezlocillin (mzpc), sulbenicillin (sbpc), gentamicin (gm), amikacin (amk), cefotiam (ctm), cefmetazole (cmz), cefoperazone (cpz), cefotaxime (ctx), ceftizoxime (czx), cefmenoxime (cmx) and latamoxef (lmox) was done by using agar micro-broth dilution methods. h. influenzae was most markedly  susceptible to cephems of the third generation, especially to cmx, czx and ctx by which about 95% of h. influenzae tested were inhibited the growth under the concentration with less than or equal to 0.10 microgram/ml of the drugs. furthermore, annual changes in susceptibility of h. influenzae to various antibiotics was analyzed over the period from 1981 to 1983. the frequency of s. pneumoniae isolated from patients with chronic bronchitis or bronchiectasis was about 10% in this survey. however, in the case of respiratory infections associated with bacterial pneumonia, the frequencies were as follows; 24.8% (77 cases/311 cases) in 1981, 17.7% (44 cases/248 cases) in 1982, and 11.0% (39 cases/355 cases) in 1983. the frequency of isolation of s. pneumoniae decreased every year.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == cefotiam therapy of lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  == cefotiam, a new cephalosporin, was evaluated in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in 29 patients. the bacteria isolated from the sputum of these patients included streptococcus pneumoniae (31%), klebsiella pneumoniae (31%), and haemophilus influenzae (28%). satisfactory response was observed in 90% of the patients. there were three treatment failures, two superinfections, and four colonizations with gram-negative organisms resistant to the drug. superficial phlebitis was noted in two patients. the results of this study suggest that cefotiam is an effective and well-tolerated antibiotic for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections due to susceptible organisms.

TI  == comparison of ceftriaxone and ampicillin plus chloramphenicol for the therapy of  acute bacterial meningitis.
AB  == ceftriaxone, a new third-generation cephalosporin, appears to be promising for the therapy of acute bacterial meningitis. the 90% mbcs of ceftriaxone against 54 recent cerebrospinal fluid isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, and haemophilus influenzae were less than or equal to 0.06 to 0.25  micrograms/ml. we examined the efficacy and safety of ceftriaxone therapy of meningitis in bahia, brazil. the study was conducted in two phases; in phase a, ceftriaxone was coadministered with ampicillin. the mean cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of ceftriaxone 24 h after an intravenous dose of 80 mg/kg were 4.2 and 2.3 micrograms/ml on days 4 to 6 and 10 to 12 of therapy, respectively. these concentrations were 8- to more than 100-fold greater than the 90% mbcs against the relevant pathogens. in phase b, ceftriaxone (administered once daily at a dose of 80 mg/kg after an initial dose of 100 mg/kg) was compared with conventional dosages of ampicillin and chloramphenicol in a prospective randomized trial of 36 children and adults with meningitis. the groups were comparable based on clinical, laboratory, and etiological parameters. ceftriaxone given once daily produced results equivalent to those obtained with ampicillin plus chloramphenicol, as judged by cure rate, case fatality ratio, resolution with sequelae, type and severity of sequelae, time to sterility of cerebrospinal  fluid, and potentially drug-related adverse effects. the cerebrospinal fluid bactericidal titers obtained 16 to 24 h after ceftriaxone dosing were usually 1:512 to greater than 1:2,048 even late in the treatment course, compared with values of 1:8 to 1:32 in patients receiving ampicillin plus chloramphenicol. ceftriaxone clearly deserves further evaluation for the therapy of meningitis; the optimal dose, dosing frequency (every 12 h or every 24 h), and duration of therapy remain to be determined.

TI  == a preliminary survey of aerobic bacteria in breast milk of mothers from the low-income group in nigeria.
AB  == the aerobic bacteria colonizing breast milk of the low-income group in nigeria were quantified to assess its suitability for use in milk banks. in parallel, the nutritional and health status of donating mothers and their infants were assessed by physicians. the aerobic bacteria contained in the specimens included streptococcus salivarius, bacillus cereus, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermides. in general, the microbial load found in these milk samples is lower than levels considered dangerous. an analysis of the results showed that 50% of the mother's milk is contaminated, 17% of which was infected with primary pathogens. there was no correlation between demographic data, nutritional or health status of either mother or infant and microbial load  in mother's milk. milk obtained from this socio-economic group, is therefore, considered safe for use in milk banks.

TI  == cefadroxil in the horse: pharmacokinetics and in vitro antibacterial activity.
AB  == sodium cefadroxil was administered as a single intravenous dose (25 mg/kg) to six healthy adult mares. plasma samples were collected over a 24-h period and cefadroxil concentrations were measured by microbiological assay. the pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug was appropriately described in terms of a one-compartment open model. values for the major pharmacokinetic terms were: extrapolated initial plasma concentration = 59.2 +/- 15.0 micrograms/ml; half-life = 46 +/- 20 min; apparent volume of distribution = 462 +/- 191 ml/kg; and body clearance = 7.0 +/- 0.6 ml/min.kg. in a subsequent study, a suspension of cefadroxil monohydrate was administered intragastrically (25 mg/kg) to the same six horses. plasma concentrations of the drug peaked at 1-2 h but, in general, absorption was both poor and inconsistent. the data were unsuitable for  determination of cefadroxil bioavailability from this oral dosage form. ninety-nine isolates of eleven bacterial species obtained from clinically ill horses were tested for susceptibility to cefadroxil. all strains of streptococcus equi, streptococcus zooepidemicus, coagulase-positive staphylococci, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and five out of six strains of actinobacillus  suis were highly susceptible to the drug (mic less than 4 micrograms/ml). escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella sp. showed intermediate susceptibility (mic 4-16 micrograms/ml), while all isolates of corynebacterium (rhodococcus) equi, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa proved to be  highly resistant to cefadroxil (mic greater than 128 micrograms/ml).

TI  == the antagonism of tetracycline and ferric iron in vivo.
AB  == to test the hypothesis that the in-vivo antibiotic action of tetracycline might be affected by ferric iron and the enhancement of infection by ferric iron by tetracycline, the actions of intraperitoneal antibiotic and local ferric ammonium citrate, given separately and together, were measured in the dorsal skin of guinea-pigs bearing lesions due to staphylococci, streptococci, a proteus sp., an erysipelothrix sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila and klebsiella pneumoniae. tetracycline, given in two intraperitoneal  doses of 25 mg/kg at 0 and 2 h after intracutaneous challenge, maintained plasma  concentrations of 4-6 micrograms/ml for more than the first 4 h of infection, after which the local lesions had become largely insusceptible to the antibiotic. the intracutaneous injection of fe 10 micrograms in a volume of 0.1 ml containing the bacteria was sufficient to enhance infection by those strains susceptible to  this effect. the in-vivo efficacy of tetracycline was not always related to low mic; a low mic was sometimes associated with little action and a high mic with moderate action. sixteen organisms were tested. the iron diminished the tetracycline effect only feebly with one staphylococcal strain and the strain of  e. rhusiopathiae. in only one case, with a strain of proteus sp., was the tetracycline action grossly diminished. on the other hand, tetracycline diminished the enhancement effect of iron moderately with three strains of staphylococci and one strain each of k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa and c. perfringens, and strongly with two strains of staphylococci, a group-c streptococcus and one strain each of k. pneumoniae, e. rhusiopathiae and a. hydrophila. it is evident that the diminution of tetracycline action by moderate  excess of readily available fe , whether endogenous or administered, is an unlikely event (three instances among the 16 tested) whereas the diminution of the infection-enhancing effect of iron by tetracycline is much more likely (12 instances among the 16). insofar as a decrease in iron available for enhancement  of infection is valid evidence of a diminution of the iron available for necessary physiological processes of the subject treated, our results suggest that these processes might be affected by tetracycline.

TI  == multiplicity of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin antibiotic resistance determinants.
AB  == bacteria can resist macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin (mls) antibiotics enzymically by alteration of the target site or detoxification of the antibiotic. n6-dimethylation of adenine in 23 s ribosomal rna confers resistance to m, l, and s b-type (mlsb) antibiotics. investigation, by dna annealing, of the relationship between the genes specifying this resistance mechanism from streptococcus (groups a,b,d, and h, and pneumoniae), staphylococcus aureus, bacillus licheniformis, bacteroides fragilis, lactobacillus casei, and streptomyces erythreus indicated substantial sequence diversity among the mlsb resistance (r) determinants. a minimum of four distinct classes of mlsb r determinants could be defined: classes a and b for the gram-positive cocci (streptococci pmeumococci and staphylococci), class c for b. licheniformis, and class d for bact. fragilis. these data do not support the hypothesis that the r determinants were acquired recently from a single common origin and suggest an easy exchange of genetic information among the gram-positive cocci. the genetic classes do not correlate with differences in phenotypic expression or in regulation (inducibility or constitutivity) of resistance towards mlsb antibiotics. inactivation of the drug confers resistance  to m and/or l and/or s or sa or sb antibiotics and has been detected in strains of streptococcus, staph. aureus, lactobacillus, c. perfringens, streptomyces, and recently in the gram-negative organism escherichia coli. we have cloned and sequenced a dna fragment conferring high level resistance (mic greater than 2 g/l) to erythromycin by hydrolysis of the antibiotic. the distribution of this 'new' character in enterobacteria isolated from human faeces was studied by colony hybridization using an intragenic probe. the gene for the erythromycin esterase was detected in numerous strains of e. coli belonging to various biotypes, in klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter agglomerans, and in one 'coliform'. moreover, our results indicated the existence of at least two classes of genes specifying resistance to erythromycin by inactivation of the antibiotic  in enterobacteria.

TI  == therapy for lower respiratory tract infections with imipenem/cilastatin: a review of worldwide experience.
AB  == the worldwide experience with imipenem/cilastatin as of november 7, 1983, in the  intravenous therapy for severe and moderately severe infections of the lower respiratory tract is reviewed. of 204 assessable patients treated in 77 studies conducted by 70 investigative groups (43 in the united states, 27 in other countries), 173 (85%) were cured of their infections or showed improvement. imipenem was tested against 289 of 303 bacterial pathogens isolated before therapy, and 284 (98%) were found to be susceptible. principal pathogens were pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella species, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. a total of 76% of infecting pathogens were eradicated during therapy. of 54 imipenem-susceptible infecting strains of p. aeruginosa, however, 57% were eradicated, 19% acquired resistance to imipenem, and 17% were replaced by new resistant strains of p. aeruginosa. higher doses of imipenem/cilastatin and/or combined therapy with an aminoglycoside may improve these results. imipenem/cilastatin compares well with  the most active agents available for therapy for lower respiratory tract infections.

TI  == subcellular localization and further characterization of a new elastase inhibitor from pneumococci.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae contains an inhibitor of human neutrophil elastase. the  agent does not inhibit other proteases, including neutrophil cathepsin g and pancreatic elastase. it is active in the presence of insoluble elastin as well as synthetic elastase substrates. the inhibitor is present in the pneumococcal cell  membrane. [125i]elastase binding studies and inhibition experiments with intact bacterial autoplasts suggest that this agent has its elastase-binding site(s) exposed on the outside of the bacterial cell membrane. native and randomized membrane vesicles also show equal inhibitory activity. active inhibitor can be solubilized from pneumococcal membranes by treatment with a dipolar ionic detergent and can then be reconstituted, in active form, within artificial liposomes. complex formation between the neutrophil elastase inhibitor and neutrophil elastase may involve noncovalent associations. although elastase containing a covalently bound substrate analog no longer binds the pneumococcal inhibitor, the present study shows that complex formation is nevertheless independent of neutrophil elastase catalytic activity. specific inhibitor activity and inhibitor release during bile salt-stimulated autolysis are greater  in a nonnecrotizing pneumococcal strain (type i) than they are in a necrotizing strain (type iii) or in klebsiella pneumoniae. these results may help explain the frequent resolution of some pneumococcal pneumonias, despite the presence in the  early pneumonic exudate of many neutrophils containing an elastolytic protease capable of injuring lung connective tissue.

AB  == we analyzed the clinical and bacteriologic features of 12 episodes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (sbp) in 11 children (four boys, median age 5.5 years) with chronic liver disease. all patients had cirrhosis and ascites; four had hypersplenism, and one was asplenic. symptoms included increasing abdominal distention, pyrexia, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal disturbance, and encephalopathy. nine had rebound tenderness on abdominal palpation, and 12 had reduced bowel sounds. the most frequent organisms isolated from culture of ascitic fluid were streptococcus pneumoniae (nine). klebsiella (two), and haemophilus influenzae (one); blood cultures grew identical organisms in nine. seven patients died despite intensive antibiotic therapy. in the 3 months prior to onset of sbp, defective yeast opsonization and reduced serum concentration of  c4 were found in all nine children tested; eight had reduced concentration of c3. functional deficiency of all complement components was present in four tested within 1 to 5 months of the onset. in contrast, only eight of 59 cirrhotic children without sbp had low c3, and eight had defective yeast opsonization, although 35 had low c4 values. four of the patients with sbp and low c3 and c4 concentrations had normal concentrations at the time of diagnosis of liver disease 2 to 5 years previously. opsonization of type iii pneumococci was reduced in sera from three patients who subsequently developed pneumococcal peritonitis.  the incidence of sbp in children with chronic liver disease is similar to that in adults, as are the clinical features. our observations suggest that complement deficiency induced by chronic liver disease may be important in the pathogenesis  of sbp.

AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a synthetic sulfazecin derivative, were compared with those of aztreonam, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and cefsulodin. carumonam was highly active in vitro against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and haemophilus influenzae and weakly active against streptococcus pneumoniae, but it was not active against staphylococcus aureus. the mics of carumonam for 90% of 1,156 clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates were between 0.013 and 25 micrograms/ml, which were the lowest mics of the antibiotics tested. the mic of carumonam for 90% of klebsiella oxytoca was 0.2 micrograms/ml, whereas that of aztreonam was 50 micrograms/ml. the superiority of carumonam to aztreonam and the reference cephalosporins was also demonstrated by their activities against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. the mic of carumonam for 90% of p. aeruginosa was 12.5 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the mics of aztreonam and ceftazidime. carumonam showed a high affinity for the penicillin-binding protein 3 of gram-negative bacteria, but not for the penicillin-binding proteins of s. aureus and bacteroides fragilis. carumonam was  resistant to hydrolysis by 12 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and 7 chromosomal  beta-lactamases. it was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the beta-lactamase of k. oxytoca; this stability is related to the superiority of the in vitro and in vivo activities of carumonam to those of aztreonam against this species. in general, the protective activities (50% effective dose) of carumonam  and reference antibiotics in mice with experimental intraperitoneal infections correlated with the in vitro activities (mic); carumonam showed excellent protective activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == induction of increased antibody responses to pneumococcal type 19f polysaccharide by klebsiella polysaccharide.
AB  == the level of antibody to pneumococcal 19f polysaccharide (ps) was studied in the  serum of mice inoculated with klebsiella k2 ps or pneumococcal 19f ps or both. the serum antibody levels and the igm plaque-forming-cell (pfc) response after immunization were higher in mice given both k2 ps and 19f ps than in mice of a control group given 19f ps alone. this immune response was also higher than the sum of pfc production in mice given 19f ps or k2 ps separately. thus, k2 ps produced the cross-reactive antibody to 19f ps and also enhanced the magnitude of the antibody response to 19f ps. this response appeared to be specific for the 19f ps. the resulting high levels of antibody to pneumococcal 19f persisted for eight weeks after the administration of k2 ps and 19f ps. animals immunized with  both type 3 ps and k2 ps did not show an increased antibody response to pneumococcal type 3 ps. klebsiella k-o3 antigen also stimulated the immune response to 19f ps. higher immunologic responses to 19f ps were also induced in nude mice injected with the cross-reacting k2 ps or k47 ps and 19f ps. the ability to stimulate an antibody response to 19f ps by administering both k2 ps and 19f ps could not be transferred with spleen cells obtained from mice given both k2 ps and 19f ps.

TI  == in vitro studies on the antibacterial activities of ym-13115, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of ym-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. the compound was highly active against the common members of the enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. ym-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, providencia rettgeri, and providencia stuartii. the activity of ym-13115 against pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. against haemophilus influenzae ym-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. ym-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. the concentrations of ym-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78  and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit streptococcus faecalis. ym-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. ym-13115 is extremely active  against p. aeruginosa and members of the enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the pancreatic fluid.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of canine pancreatic fluid was investigated in an attempt to understand the resistance of this organ, when intact, to ascending bacterial infections. the pancreatic fluid demonstrated bactericidal activity against escherichia coli, shigella species, salmonella species, and klebsiella pneumoniae; bacteriostatic activity against coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa; and fungistatic activity against candida albicans. there was no demonstrable antibacterial activity against bacteroides fragilis and streptococcus faecalis. the antibacterial activity was dialyzable and ph dependent, but independent of heat,  the activity of several digestive pancreatic enzymes, and the bacterial inoculum. electron micrographs of escherichia coli exposed to pancreatic fluid did not demonstrate changes in the bacterial cell wall. tracer studies of susceptible bacteria demonstrated decreased leucine uptake when briefly exposed to pancreatic fluid. the antibacterial activity was found by column chromatography to be a small molecular peptide. it is likely that pancreatic antibacterial factors protect the pancreas from ascending bacterial infections and operate along with other factors in the homeostasis of the upper small bowel flora.

TI  == bacteraemia at the university hospital of the west indies--a report of 222 cases.
AB  == a total of 222 cases of septicaemia was recorded at the university hospital of the west indies between june 1982 and june 1983. this gave an overall incidence of 16.1 per 1000 admissions. the 233 bacterial strains isolated comprised 100 gram-positive and 133 gram-negative organisms with klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus being the most frequent. highest rates of septicaemia were recorded in patients less than 1 year and over  50 years of age. septicaemia caused by gram-positive organisms was predominantly  a disease of children whereas that caused by gram-negative organisms arose more often in neonates and in patients over 50 years of age. a predisposing factor was noted in 104 patients of whom 42 had neoplastic disease. the most frequently identified initial sites of infection were the respiratory tract, the gastro-intestinal tract and the meninges. most blood stream infections were community-acquired, three quarters of all septicaemic patients being admitted to  the departments of medicine or paediatrics. there were 11 cases of polymicrobial  septicaemia caused predominantly by gram-negative organisms in patients with underlying disease. appropriate antimicrobial drugs were administered to 57% of septicaemic patients whereas 17% received superfluous antimicrobial therapy. in those patients who received inappropriate antimicrobial therapy there was a marked increase in mortality. forty of 61 deaths were attributed to septicaemia.  mortality from septicaemia caused by gram-negative organisms was 21% compared with 13% for that caused by gram-positive organisms. the organisms associated with the highest case fatality rates were escherichia coli, 53%; enterobacter sp., 27%; and beta-haemolytic streptococci 24%. there were no deaths from septicaemia caused by haemophilus influenzae, salmonella sp. or serratia sp. the  highest mortality rates were associated with neoplastic disease, diabetes, polymicrobial septicaemia, urinary tract infections and old age.

TI  == the pharmacokinetics and serum and urine bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin.
AB  == ciprofloxacin is an investigational quinolone agent possessing an impressive antibacterial spectrum. its pharmacokinetics were studied in six volunteers after 250-mg and 500-mg single oral doses, and its bactericidal activity compared to that of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole given to the same volunteers. mean peak serum levels were 1.45 micrograms/ml and 2.46 micrograms/ml for 250-mg and 500-mg doses, and time to peak was 1 and 1.3 hours. the 12-hour levels were 0.12 micrograms and 0.22 microgram. half-life (t1/2)alpha were 0.32 and 0.43 with t1/2 beta were 3.97 and 4.15 and volume of distribution (area) were 80l and 90l, respectively. area under the concentration curve (auc) was 5.65 h x micrograms/ml and 10.37h x micrograms/ml. serum clearance was 23l for both doses. approximately 49% of the 250-mg dose and 43% of the 500-mg dose was recovered in the urine. bactericidal levels were determined against clinical isolates. sera at 1.5 hours  after the 500-mg dose averaged bactericidal levels of 1:20 or better for an escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and beta-lactamase producing haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis. urinary bactericidal levels at eight to 12 hours were greater than or equal to 1:157 for e coli, k pneumoniae, gentamicin-piperacillin resistant p aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and 1:20 for streptococcus faecalis. serum bactericidal levels were superior, and urine bactericidal levels were superior or equal to the bactericidal levels obtained with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == phagocytosis by human leukocytes, phagosomal ph and degradation of seven species  of bacteria were studied by a flow cytometric method. the percentage of phagocytosing leukocytes was similar for all bacterial strains examined, but salmonella typhi and neisseria meningitidis were more slowly phagocytosed than other bacteria. the phagosomal ph surrounding the different bacterial species 15  min after the start of phagocytosis were: streptococcus pneumoniae 4.4; n. meningitidis 4.9; str. pyogenes 5.1; staphylococcus aureus 5.2; escherichia coli  5.3; s. typhi 5.4; and klebsiella pneumoniae 5.7. for longer incubation periods,  the phagosomal ph remained nearly constant. staph. aureus, e. coli and s. typhi were the most readily degraded of the species tested. the proteins of all bacteria were degraded more rapidly than their dna as determined by measurements  of the loss of fluorescein-isothiocyanate-fluorescence and ethidium bromide-fluorescence, respectively. the rate of degradation varied from one bacterial species to another. the degradation of proteins and dna was maximal for bacteria residing in a phagosomal environment estimated to be between ph 5.2 and  5.4.

TI  == selection of an aminoglycoside antibiotic for administration to horses.
AB  == the serum concentrations of the aminoglycosides neomycin, kanamycin and streptomycin were determined after intravenous (iv) and intramuscular (im) administration. these values were then related to the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of a number of equine pathogenic bacteria to determine the duration of therapeutic serum concentrations of the aminoglycosides in the horse. pharmacokinetic analysis of the data using neomycin as the example revealed a mean (+/- sd) peak serum concentration of 23.2 +/- 10.2 micrograms/ml present at  30 mins, and at 8 h the serum concentration was 2.8 +/- 0.8 micrograms/ml. from the pharmacological analysis of concentration-time data it was shown that neomycin was very rapidly absorbed from the im injection site, with an absorption half-time of 0.16 +/- 0.05 and was well absorbed (systemic availability was 73.7  +/- 26.9 per cent). a peak tissue level, which represented 40 per cent of the amount of drug in the body, was obtained at 32 mins after injection of the drug.  at 8 h, the fractions of the dose in the central and peripheral compartments of the model were 1.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively, and 96 per cent was the cumulative amount eliminated up to that time. based on the mic values of the  majority of isolates of corynebacterium equi, and only a few isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium and streptococcus equi, one would expect a serum concentration of more than 2 micrograms neomycin/ml up to 8 h following im dosage (10 mg/kg) to be therapeutically effective.

AB  == bacterial growth rate was evaluated by estimating the increase in atp content of  cultures of bacterial suspensions using luciferase assay, and the method was applied to the estimation of bactericidal activity of serum and anti-bacterial activity of antibiotics. the results obtained were as follows: the bacterial numbers or bacterial growth rate determined by the atp-bioluminescence method was in accordance with those by cfu assay and spectrometrical assay by optical density readings. furthermore this method was confirmed to be non-time-consuming  and more simple than other methods. using this method, anti-bacterial activity of fresh serum was evaluated. the serum suppressed the growth rate of e. coli, str.  fecalis, cbs, kleb. pneumoniae and staph. aureus at least for 2 hours. heat-inactivated serum and absorbed serum with bacteria tended to lose such suppressive effect. thus the main effective factors seem to be complements and specific antibody. the anti-microbial activity of antibiotics was enhanced by addition of fresh serum to bacterial cultures, and the results were not in accordance with those by the conventional disc method. thus the sensitivity test  under the influence of fresh serum is recommended in order to know the clinical effect of antibiotics. these results suggest the usefulness of atp-bioluminescence method in the clinical laboratory examinations or investigations.

TI  == evaluation of experimental teat dip containing sodium chlorite and lactic acid by excised teat assay.
AB  == an experimental teat dip containing sodium chlorite and lactic acid, diluted in water, was evaluated by excised teat protocol. the teat dip was tested against 21 microorganisms. included were: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. numerous strains were tested for strain differences. environmental bacteria were included because of their increasing importance as a cause of bovine mastitis. all excised teats were dipped in a bacterial suspension containing about 1 x 10(8) cfu/ml. negative control teats were not dipped in a germicidal compound. positive controls were dipped in 1% iodophor. effectiveness of the experimental teat dip was expressed as the percent reduction in mean log of bacteria recovered from dipped teats as compared to numbers recovered from control teats. the sodium chlorite - lactic acid dip caused a greater percent log reduction than iodophor for 14 of 21 strains tested. however, differences were generally slight. the experimental teat dip appeared effective against gram-negative bacteria. some differences in percent log reduction were observed between strains of the same species. lowest effectiveness and greatest strain variation were observed with staphylococcus aureus for both dips tested.

TI  == pharmacokinetic and experimental data on beta-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of patients.
AB  == the in vitro and animal model studies on optimal dosage of the newer beta-lactams are summarized and put into historical perspective. they provide a rationale for  dosage schedules that continuously maintain inhibitory serum and tissue concentrations throughout the dosage interval. in vitro studies on the post-antibiotic effect (pae) with beta-lactams revealed only short time periods of post-antibiotic growth suppression with gram-positive cocci and no post-antibiotic effect with gram-negative bacilli. a similar lack of persistent growth suppression was observed with beta-lactams in a neutropenic mouse thigh infection model for both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. in the same animal model, dosing regimens of beta-lactams which continuously provided serum concentrations above the mic were more efficacious than those that did not. the newer third-generation cephalosporins have prolonged half-lives and can maintain  serum levels above the mic for most pathogens, even when dosed at widely spaced intervals.

TI  == the relevance of arterial wall microbiology to the treatment of prosthetic graft  infections: graft infection vs. arterial infection.
AB  == one potential, but poorly studied source for intraoperative contamination of vascular grafts is the native artery to which the prosthetic graft is attached. the purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between arterial wall microbiology and graft infection. between july 1, 1981, and march 31, 1982, arterial specimens were cultured from 88 (30%) of 298 patients undergoing clean,  elective arterial reconstructive procedures. control cultures were obtained from  adjacent adipose or lymph node tissue. positive cultures were obtained from 38 of 88 (43%) of the arterial walls cultured but from none of the control cultures (0  of 20) (p less than 0.001). the most common organism cultured was staphylococcus  epidermidis (27 of 38; 71%). our overall graft infection rate since january 1, 1981, is 0.9% (3 of 335). all three graft infections occurred in patients with positive arterial cultures. arterial and graft cultures were also obtained from 20 patients treated for 22 graft infections over the past 13 years. organisms recovered included staphylococcal species (36%), enteric organisms (46%), and mixtures of the two (18%). these patients with culture-positive graft infections  were divided retrospectively into two groups: those with positive and those with  negative arterial cultures. positive arterial cultures were associated with suture line disruption in 8 of 14 cases (57%), but there were no arterial disruptions in patients with negative cultures (0 of 8) (p less than 0.01). these data document a significant correlation between positive arterial wall cultures and subsequent prosthetic infection and also suggest that infection involving the arterial wall is a major determinant of the morbidity and mortality associated with the treatment of prosthetic graft sepsis.

TI  == immediate postmortem cultures in an intensive care nursery.
AB  == the results of several published studies suggest that bacterial infection plays an important role in the mortality of neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) patients. to evaluate more thoroughly this role we have routinely performed postmortem cultures of blood and cerebrospinal fluid on all infants who die in our nicu. during a 5-year review period 25.9% of infants who died had one or both cultures positive for an organism considered to be pathogenic in the neonate. the organisms most commonly cultured were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli and group b streptococcus. of those infants who had positive postmortem cultures and  who had an autopsy, 95% had histologic evidence of infection. forty-three percent of our infants with positive postmortem cultures were not suspected of having a serious infection and had not received antibiotics before death. postmortem cultures appeared to be helpful in identifying nicu patients in whom serious infection may have played a role in mortality. unsuspected serious infection is a common finding in infants who die in a neonatal intensive care setting.

TI  == endogenous infection in mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. a feature of bacterial translocation.
AB  == slc:ddy mice that received a single intraperitoneal injection of 200 mg/kg streptozotocin (stz) were examined for persistency of diabetes (changes of indigenous bacterial floras, and bacterial translocation. significant diabetes (increase in plasma glucose and decrease in insulin) was recognized 2 weeks after the injection, and persisted for 12 weeks. the numbers of aerobic gram-negative bacilli, staphylococci (including micrococci), and streptococci in caecal and oral floras were significantly increased, but the numbers of anaerobic bacteria in caecal flora were hardly changed. bacterial translocation of indigenous bacteria to the mesenteric lymph node, lung, or kidney was detectable in some mice 2 weeks after the injection. the incidence of bacterial translocation in these stz-treated mice then increased; infection caused by several organisms, e.g., klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococci, or lactobacillus sp., occurred in lung, liver, spleen, kidneys, and mesenteric lymph node. no indigenous bacteria were cultured from these organs of control mice. this endogenous infection may have been due to the over population of several bacterial strains caused by disruption of indigenous floras along with depression of immunological function.

AB  == penetration of lincomycin (lcm) in choledochal and cholecystic bile as well as in the gallbladder tissue and liver tissue was investigated together with bacteria detectable in the bile in order to evaluate basically usefulness of this antibiotic in the treatment of infections of the hepatocystic duct. intravenous drip infusion of lcm 1.5 g (in 500 ml of 5% glucose solution) over 1.5--2 hours resulted in mean drug concentrations of 33.9 and 10.1 micrograms/ml in serum at 2 and 4 hours post start of infusion respectively; 215.5 micrograms/ml in choledochal bile at 3 hours 15 minutes; 252.7 micrograms/ml in cholecystic bile at 3 hours 36 minutes; 28.1 micrograms/g in gallbladder tissue at 2 hours 55 minutes; and 15.4 micrograms/g in liver tissue at 4 hours. a cross-over study of  lcm and cefazolin (cez) in 2 cases where t-tubes were employed demonstrated evidently higher biliary levels of lcm than cez. bacteriological examination showed that hafnia alvei plus streptococcus faecalis were presented in choledochal bile from just 1 of 4 cases while in cholecystic bile from 9 of 15 cases were detected 22 strains of organisms including klebsiella pneumoniae (7 strains), bacteroides fragilis (5), escherichia coli (2), citrobacter freundii (2) and serratia marcescens (2). a total of 7 strains of anaerobes including b. fragilis was isolated. the above concentrations of lcm in the bile, gallbladder tissue and liver tissue sufficiently covered the mic90 of this antibiotic determined by us in 1980 for major species of anaerobes including clinical isolates of b. fragilis.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == two hundred seventy-six bacterial strains were isolated as possible causative pathogens mainly from sputum in 248 patients with lower respiratory tract infections at 12 medical institutions in various parts of japan during the period from september 1982 to march 1983. of these, 272 isolates including 28 staphylococcus aureus strains, 38 streptococcus pneumoniae strains, 107 haemophilus influenzae strains, 68 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 17 klebsiella  pneumoniae strains, 9 escherichia coli strains and 5 strains of other species were tested in vitro for mics of various antibiotics, and their drug sensitivity  distributions determined. data were also analyzed for distribution of cases by clinical entities, age and sex, interrelations between the types of infections and the species and frequency of isolation of organisms, and relations of the antimicrobial regimens at collection of clinical specimens to the species and frequency of isolation of the organisms. it engenders great interest that there was a significant increase in frequency of s. aureus isolation within 7 days after antibiotic therapy, compared to pretreatment isolation frequency, in the 1982 series. this seems to deserve further investigation in detail. the h. influenzae strains isolated with the highest frequency in 1981 and those in 1982  were examined as to susceptibility to several representative antibiotics, with interdrug comparisons: abpc vs. sbpc, ctm vs. cmz, and cmx vs. lmox. the isolates demonstrated high degrees of susceptibility to these drugs and there was no conspicuous change in bacterial sensitivity to the drugs.

TI  == an extended model for transfer of micro-organisms via the hands: differences between organisms and the effect of alcohol disinfection.
AB  == a model for contact transfer of micro-organisms by hand has been extended to include representatives of bacterial species responsible for a majority of hospital-acquired infections. the ability of the organisms to transfer from contaminated fabrics to hands and from hands to sterile fabrics was measured, as  was their ability to survive on the skin of the hands. there were differences between the species. staphylococcus saprophyticus transferred well to the hand but not as well from hand to fabric as the other species; it survived well on skin. pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella aerogenes and serratia marcescens transferred moderately well overall and also survived on the skin. these results  were in contrast to those obtained with a strain of escherichia coli and one of streptococcus pyogenes. the contact transfer model was used to investigate the use of small volumes of alcohol in preventing transfer via the hands. an alcohol  handrub of either 0.3 ml 80% ethanol or 0.3 ml 70% isopropanol gave reductions in transfer slightly less than that of a soap and water wash. raising the volume, and consequently the contact time, to 0.5 ml 70% isopropanol gave a 14000-fold reduction in transfer, statistically indistinguishable from that of a thorough soap and water wash (9800-fold reduction).

TI  == current mechanisms of resistance to antimicrobial agents in microorganisms causing infection in the patient at risk for infection.
AB  == the mechanisms of resistance encountered in bacteria causing infection in the patient at risk for infection are diverse. most resistance currently seen is the  result of plasmid transfer rather than mutational events. however, extensive use  of antimicrobial agents in the hospital has caused the selection of organisms resistant to many agents by virtue of chromosomally mediated mechanisms. staphylococcus aureus resistant to beta-lactams due to altered penicillin-binding proteins has become a problem in certain patients such as narcotic addicts and chronic care facility patients exposed to many beta-lactam antibiotics. s. epidermidis has also proved to be a problem in patients with indwelling foreign devices, and altered penicillin-binding proteins also make these organisms resistant to available penicillins and cephalosporins. streptococcus fecalis has  become increasingly resistant to aminoglycosides, erythromycin, and tetracyclines due to plasmid-mediated enzymes. hemophilus influenzae resistant to both penicillins and chloramphenicol by virtue of beta-lactamases and chloramphenicol  transacetylase has been encountered. beta-lactamase-mediated resistance of enterobacteriaceae, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae to beta-lactam antibiotics has increased, and resistance of serratia marcescens and pseudomonas  aeruginosa to aminoglycosides and penicillins is a widespread phenomenon. mechanisms to reduce resistance will include not only careful attention to hygienic practices but also more appropriate use of antibiotics selecting the proper agent depending on the type of patient and environment in which the infection develops.

TI  == significance of encapsulated bacteroides melaninogenicus and bacteroides fragilis groups in mixed infections.
AB  == organisms of the bacteroides melaninogenicus and bacteroides fragilis groups are  often found mixed with facultatively anaerobic organisms in infections. the relative importance of these bacteroides groups and facultative anaerobic pathogens in mixed infections was investigated in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. this was determined by observing the effect of antimicrobial therapy directed against one or both organisms present in the abscess. clindamycin or metronidazole was used for treatment of infections caused by bacteroides species, and either gentamicin, penicillin, ampicillin, or oxacillin was used for treatment of infections caused by facultative flora. in almost all instances the  aerobic counterparts in the infection were more important than the unencapsulated bacteroides species. on the other hand, encapsulated b. melaninogenicus group organisms were found to be more important in abscess formation than were group a  streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus. encapsulated b. fragilis group organisms were found to be more important than or as important as escherichia coli and group d streptococci and less important than s. aureus, group a streptococci, and k. pneumoniae in induction of subcutaneous abscesses. this study demonstrates that encapsulated bacteroides species are a factor that should be considered in the treatment of mixed infections with antibiotics.

TI  == in vitro and clinical evaluation of ceforanide.
AB  == ceforanide, a new cephalosporin antibiotic with a long half-life (three hours), was evaluated for its antimicrobial activity, pharmacology, and clinical efficacy. fifty-two patients with 56 infections due to susceptible organisms received ceforanide, 0.5 g, 1 g, or 2 g, intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours for four to 60 days (average: 14.1 days). the in vitro studies of our clinical isolates showed that 12.0 micrograms/ml or less of ceforanide inhibited  all streptococcus pneumoniae, beta hemolytic streptococci group a, b, f, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and hemophilus influenzae. after a 1 gram intramuscular dose, the mean peak serum concentration at one hour was 44.0 micrograms/ml, and at 12 hours was 3.8 micrograms/ml. after a 1 gram intravenous  dose, the mean peak serum concentration was 65.0 micrograms/ml, and the mean trough serum concentration at 12 hours was 9.6 micrograms/ml. the infections treated included ten pneumonias, ten urinary tract infections, seven bacteremias, two osteomyelitis, and 35 skin-soft tissue infections. of the 56 evaluable infections treated, 52 had a clinical cure with only four failures. ceforanide was well tolerated, with no patients developing thrombophlebitis, or liver or renal abnormalities. three patients developed abnormal coombs' reactions and one  had diarrhea.

TI  == cerebrospinal fluid glucose and leukocyte responses in experimental meningitis.
AB  == the fall in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) glucose and csf leukocyte response was studied in cats with experimental meningitis. klebsiella pneumoniae or streptococcus pneumoniae were injected intracisternally, and the latter organisms were incubated with csf in vitro. when 10(6)-10(9)k. pneumoniae were incubated with 4 ml of csf, the time time necessary for the glucose to decrease to less than 10 mg/dl ranged from 6.5 to 2.5 h, at a rate proportional to the size of the inoculum. when the same numbers of bacteria were injected intracisternally, the time ranged from 9 to 3 h, and the csf leukocyte response did not exceed 1200 wbc/mm3. at this time, only minimal histological changes in brain and choroid plexus were seen. twenty hours after intrathecal k. pneumoniae, large numbers of  leukocytes (up to 4 x 10(4)/mm3) were recovered from the csf. regardless of the number of leukocytes, however, hypoglycorrhachia occurred when the csf contained  more than 10(7) bacteria/ml. at this interval, large numbers of leukocytes were seen invading the stroma of the choroid plexus, leptomeninges and perivascular spaces. when 10(8) s. pneumoniae were injected intracisternally, csf glucose concentration decreased as rapidly as with k. pneumoniae. the spinal fluid leukocyte response to s. pneumoniae was, however, greater than that to k. pneumoniae. these results suggest that under the conditions of these studies, hypoglycorrhachia of bacterial meningitis is the result of metabolism of the bacteria with little contribution from the leukocytes.

TI  == inhibition of mastitic bacteria by bovine milk apo-lactoferrin evaluated by in vitro microassay of bacterial growth.
AB  == an in vitro microassay was developed to evaluate antimicrobial properties of bovine apo-lactoferrin. the growth of coliform, staphylococcal, and streptococcal bacterial strains in a defined synthetic medium was inhibited by bovine apo-lactoferrin (.5 to 30.0 mg/ml). addition of iron-saturated lactoferrin to the synthetic medium did not inhibit growth of test strains. inhibition by apo-lactoferrin was greater for coliform than gram-positive strains for all concentrations of apo-lactoferrin evaluated. no concentration of apo-lactoferrin  proved bactericidal for either coliform or gram-positive strains. inhibition of two coliform strains by apo-lactoferrin (10 mg/ml) was abolished by addition of ferric iron to the assay system, indicating an iron-dependent nature of apo-lactoferrin induced inhibition of bacteria. bicarbonate supplementation of the growth system containing apo-lactoferrin (1 mg/ml) increased inhibition of three coliform strains by apo-lactoferrin. addition of increasing concentrations  of citrate (2.0 mg/ml) to an assay system containing apo-lactoferrin (5 mg/ml) resulted in a concomitant reduction of growth inhibition of three coliform strains. these data indicate a potential relationship between the molar ratio of  citrate to lactoferrin of the lacteal secretion and its capacity to inhibit coliform strains associated with mastitis.

TI  == chemiluminescent response to pathogenic organisms: normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  == chemiluminescence (cl) is a sensitive indicator of phagocytosis and intracellular killing; however, little is known of the normal cl response by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes to different pathogenic microorganisms. we investigated the luminol-enhanced cl response of normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes to a number of common bacterial pathogens and two yeasts. we analyzed  the cl response to viable and heat-killed microorganisms at 25 and 37 degrees c.  the cl response to all microorganisms was greater and more rapid at 37 degrees c. variable responses were observed with viable and heat-killed microorganisms; some were unaffected, whereas other demonstrated reduced cl. each microorganism caused a reproducible response pattern, which could be placed into two general categories. in the first category were those which caused a rapid exponential rise and decay in cl: enterobacter cloacae, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, and zymosan. in the second category were those which rose slowly over a longer time course to a poorly defined peak: pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus pyogenes. the cl response also reflected serum opsonic activity. the effect of inactivated complement, factor b, and removal of specific antibody were investigated. increasing the concentration of zymosan gave a proportional rise in peak cl; however, a strain of e. coli caused a variation in  peak time rather than peak height. different cl kinetics were shown for three strains of k. pneumoniae, possibly a result of each having different membrane or  cell wall characteristics. this study defines the nature and factors affecting the normal cl response to a variety of common pathogenic microorganisms.

TI  == clinicopathologic study of six cases of meningitis and meningoencephalitis in chimpanzees (pan troglodytes).
AB  == three fatal cases of purulent meningitis and one fatal case of thromboembolic necrotizing meningoencephalitis occurred in chimpanzees from the primate center tno, the netherlands. in addition, two apes had clinical signs of meningitis and  were successfully treated. the severity of the residual hemiparesis and dysphagia in one of these two apes was such that it was killed for humane reasons. the histopathological diagnosis was chronic active meningoencephalitis. streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from five apes and klebsiella pneumoniae from one. in the majority of cases, the primary site of infection was the upper respiratory tract. after reducing the population density, initiating a vaccination program using a commercially available human polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine, and changing the cleaning procedure of the animal facilities, no other cases of meningitis or meningoencephalitis have occurred in the chimpanzee colony in the ensuing 3.5 years.

TI  == five cephalosporins: pharmacokinetics and their relation to antibacterial potency.
AB  == in a group of adult volunteers, pharmacokinetic profiles of five cephalosporins were correlated with their minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics90) against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter aerogenes. subjects received the following intravenous regimens in a randomized,  crossover fashion: (1) 0.5 gm, 1 gm, or 2 gm of cefazolin; (2) 2 gm of cephalothin; (3) 1 gm of cephapirin; (4) 1 gm of cefoxitin; or (5) 0.5 gm of cefamandole. the 500-mg dose of cefazolin produced serum concentrations that exceeded those of any of the other cephalosporins at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after administration. the area under the curve for this dose of cefazolin was at  least twice that of any of the other antibiotics. two hours after a 500-mg dose of cefazolin, serum levels exceeded the mic90 for all seven groups of pathogens;  at six hours, the 500-mg dose of cefazolin continued to achieve serum levels above the mic90 against the majority of bacterial groups. in contrast, at two hours after administration none of the other cephalosporins maintained serum levels above the mic90 for all pathogens; at six hours, the levels of cephapirin  were adequate to inhibit the two streptococci, but serum levels of all other cephalosporins were inadequate to inhibit any of the pathogens. these data indicate that a 500-mg dose of cefazolin maintains serum levels above the mics90  longer than any of the other cephalosporins tested and support the use of a 500-mg dose of cefazolin every eight hours for surgical prophylaxis and treatment of most community-acquired infections. such a comparatively low dosage offers substantial savings to both patient and hospital.

AB  == the compensatory effect of a bacterial lysate, broncho-vaxom (bv) on the immunosuppressive action of cyclophosphamide (cy) was investigated. in cy immunosuppressed mice, bv treated animals recovered to normal levels of igm and igg in serum as well of iga and igg in gut secretions significantly earlier than  controls. furthermore, normal cell proliferation in thymus, as estimated by measuring the relative size of this organ was achieved earlier in bv treated mice than in control mice. oral treatment with bv restores the number of igm anti srbc producing cells in spleen, in cy immunosuppressed mice. since immunosuppression induced by cy increases the susceptibility to various infections, we tested in immunosuppressed animals the protective effect of bv towards ip challenge infections with streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae var ozaenae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. bv led to an enhanced resistance towards both pneumococci and staphylococci challenge infections but not to the other challenge microorganisms.

TI  == activity of imipenem on aerobic bacteria.
AB  == imipenem is a new carbapenem antibiotic with a broad spectrum of activity on gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. it is a potent inhibitor of plasmid- and chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of imipenem on clinical isolates classified according to their susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics. on penicillin g-susceptible bacteria, imipenem is comparable to penicillin. on streptococci, pneumococci, staphylococcus aureus and listeria the mics were 0.02 to 0.06 mg/l.  on gonococci, mics were 0.04 to 0.25 mg/l. gram-negative bacteria susceptible to  beta-lactam antibiotics or naturally resistant to certain of them (e.g. klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ampicillin and carbenicillin) were highly susceptible to imipenem with mics from 0.06 to 0.5 mg/l. it was slightly less active on haemophilus influenzae, compared to ampicillin. on beta-lactam-resistant bacteria, imipenem maintained a remarkable activity. for penicillin-resistant pneumococci (mic 16 mg/l) the imipenem mic was 1 mg/l. imipenem was equally effective on beta-lactamase-producing and non-producing haemophilus influenzae and gonococci. among 12 nocardia asteroides tested, 11 had mic less than 1 mg/l. when tested at 30 degrees, the mic of imipenem for oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus ranged from 8 to 64 mg/l in contrast to 0.03 to 0.06 mg/l for oxacillin-sensitive isolates. eighteen strains of enterococci (17 faecium, 2 faecalis) resistant to ampicillin (mic 128 mg/l) were  more resistant to imipenem (mic 16 to 256 mg/l). imipenem was very active on beta-lactam-resistant gram-negative bacteria, including multiply-resistant salmonella typhi., with mics in a range from 0.06 to 4 mg/l).(abstract truncated  at 250 words)

AB  == cefpiramide (cpm, sm-1652) had broad-spectrum antibacterial activities against most of clinically isolated organisms to which are paid attention as pathogenic organism in the field of pediatrics. antibacterial activities of cpm against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, bordetella pertussis and proteus mirabilis were almost the same as those of cefoperazone (cpz). antibacterial activities of cpm against escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were somewhat weaker than those of cpz, but antibacterial activity of  cpm against pseudomonas aeruginosa was rather stronger than that of cpz and almost the same as that of cefsulodin. antibacterial activity of cpm has a tendency to decrease in beta-lactamase (pcase type) producing s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, etc. it is suggestive that the determination of not only the antibacterial activity of cpm against pathogenic organisms but also the  beta-lactamase producing activity of them is important on the occasion of clinical use of cpm.

TI  == [evaluation of in vitro antibacterial potencies of oral antibiotics against sputum isolates].
AB  == susceptibility of 162 sputum isolates to oral antibiotics was measured by an agar dilution method. the sputum isolates included s. pneumoniae 25 strains, s. aureus 30 strains, h. influenzae 37 strains, k. pneumoniae 51 strains and e. coli 19 strains. minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values of cefaclor (ccl), cephalexin (cex), ampicillin (abpc) and minocycline (mino) were measured for each strains. eighty percent of s. pneumoniae strains were inhibited at 0.024 to 0.05  micrograms/ml of abpc, 0.39 to 0.78 micrograms/ml of ccl, and 1.56 to 3.13 micrograms/ml of cex and mino. abpc, ccl and cex were considered to be effective  clinically when they were used with the usual dosage. however, about 30% of strains were resistant to the usual dosage of orally administrated mino. eighty percent of s. aureus strains were inhibited at 0.20 to 0.39 microgram/ml of mino  and 3.13 to 6.25 micrograms/ml of the other 3 drugs. mino is the most effective with the usual dosage. twenty to 40% of strains showed resistance to ccl, cex and abpc. eighty percent of h. influenzae strains were inhibited at 0.39 micrograms/ml of abpc, 0.78 to 1.56 micrograms/ml of mino, 3.13 micrograms/ml of  ccl and 12.5 to 25 micrograms/ml of cex. abpc should be selected as the first choice antibiotic. however, there were 2 abpc-resistant strains that were highly  susceptible to ccl. eighty percent of k. pneumoniae strains were inhibited at 0.39 to 0.78 micrograms/ml of ccl, 3.13 to 6.25 micrograms/ml of mino and cex, and 12.5 to 25 micrograms/ml of abpc. ccl seemed to be only effective oral antibiotic for k. pneumoniae infection.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == nosocomial urinary tract infections: secular trends, treatment and economics in a university hospital.
AB  == during a 71-month interval 3,024 nosocomial urinary tract infections were identified by prospective surveillance at our hospital. the annual attack rate varied between 2.0 and 3.1 per 100 admissions. gram-negative bacilli caused 74 per cent of all urinary infections and recurrent infections in the hospital accounted for only 1 per cent. the most frequent pathogens were escherichia coli  (24 per cent), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 per cent), streptococcus faecalis (7 per cent), klebsiella pneumoniae (6 per cent) and proteus mirabilis (6 per cent). candida species caused 10 per cent of the infections and may represent a hospital-acquired pathogen of increasing importance. the burn unit had a significantly higher proportion of enterobacter infections (21 per cent) than any other service (p less than 0.05). the plastic surgery service had more serratia infections (24 per cent), whereas obstetrics and gynecology had more escherichia  coli infections (47 per cent) relative to other hospital services. more than 99 per cent of the patients with nosocomial urinary tract infections received antimicrobial drugs; in 63 per cent the chart documented that drug therapy was prescribed specifically for treatment of the urinary infections. hospital-acquired urinary infections added approximately 1 million dollars to hospital expenses during the study interval. estimates were made of the economic  benefits of successful control programs.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the bactec resin-containing blood culture bottle.
AB  == the bactec resin-containing blood culture bottle (16b; johnston laboratories) was designed to bind antibiotics and to support bacterial growth. however, only modest increases in the recovery rates of pathogens have been found in clinical studies. this in vitro study evaluated the ability of the 16b to recover organisms from human serum containing clinically achievable concentrations of antibiotics. escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, and a viridans streptococcus were added to serum containing antibiotic(s), and at various time intervals of antibiotic exposure, portions were removed and inoculated into both the 16b and the 6b (conventional aerobic) bottles. the studies of the kinetics of killing of the bacterial strains by the various antibiotics showed a good correlation between those combinations of bacteria-antibiotic(s) which produced slow killing and the combinations of bacteria-antibiotic(s) which were recovered preferentially in the 16b bottles. low recovery rates were noted when the antibiotics killed the organisms rapidly.  the indications for use of the resin-containing blood culture bottle should be limited to those situations in which the patient is receiving antibiotics and the bacteremia is suspected to involve a pathogen which is killed slowly by the administered drug(s) or when the bacteremia is continuous. the failure of the bactec 16b blood culture bottle to recover organisms may in part reflect the bactericidal activity of the antibiotics administered.

TI  == pneumatocele in infants and children. report of 12 cases.
AB  == pneumatoceles were found in 2.4 per cent of 493 infants and children with pneumonia. in all cases, attempts were made to establish the etiology by means of blood cultures and of deep tracheal aspirations or pleural punctures, when indicated. a definite cause was established in 9 of 12 cases. seven were due to infection: in two hemophilus influenzae was involved; two others were due to pseudomonas aeruginosa; and staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and streptococcus pneumoniae were each isolated in one case. two pneumatoceles were seen following kerosene ingestion. a coagulase negative staphylococcus isolated only on blood culture in one other child may have been related to the illness. two patients experienced spontaneous pneumothorax and died of progressive respiratory failure due to enlargement of the pneumatocele, but all the other patients recovered without complication. pneumatoceles in childhood can result from a variety of bacterologic infections as well as from kerosene ingestion.

TI  == community-acquired bacterial pneumonia requiring admission to hospital.
AB  == patients who develop bacterial pneumonia in the community often require admission to acute-care hospitals. knowledge of the incidence of pneumonia due to different pathogens that are brought into an institution from the community may play a role in determining the patterns of infecting organisms responsible for hospital-acquired pneumonia. for 1 year, we prospectively reviewed the records of patients admitted to our 1000-bed community hospital with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (cabp). patients had clinical signs and symptoms, positive radiologic findings, and pure cultures of potential pathogens from sputum, blood, pleural fluid, lung aspirate, lung biopsy, or transtracheal aspirate. pneumonia due to legionella pneumophila was diagnosed by serum indirect fluorescent antibody (ifa) titer greater than or equal to 1:256 and clinical signs and symptoms along with response to erythromycin. of 204 patients with bacterial pneumonia, the following pathogens were implicated: streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus species, l. pneumophila, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, oral anaerobic bacteria, psuedomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, and others. most patients were more than 50 years of age and many had evidence of underlying pulmonary disease. the etiology of cabp may not be as predictable as in the past. empiric antimicrobial therapy for cabp should include agents with activity against the pathogens prevalent in the community.

TI  == susceptibility testing of biliary bacteria obtained before bile duct manipulation.
AB  == over a 3 3/4-year period, bile culture and susceptibility studies were performed  on 41 patients before any instrumentation or manipulation of the biliary tract for retained biliary stone extraction. at least one bile bacterium was identified in 90% of the patients examined. as many as seven organisms were identified in one patient. of the organisms, 62% were gram-negative aerobes, the most representative being klebsiella pneumonia; 27% were gram-positive aerobes, the enterococcus grouping being the most representative. nine percent of the isolates were anaerobic bacteria and 2% yeast. fifteen percent of the patients developed signs of sepsis. three of these patients had manipulation of their bile ducts with a choledochoscope and grew out positive blood cultures; all were treated successfully and recovered uneventfully. susceptibility testing on all aerobic bacteria was performed, indicating 97% effective coverage of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria using synergistic antibiotics of ampicillin and an aminoglycoside. even with 9% of the isolated bacteria being anaerobes, the effective coverage using the same two drug combinations was about 88%. because of the relatively high percentage (15%) of patients developing signs and symptoms of sepsis, synergistic prophylactic antimicrobial therapy is recommended in patients who are debilitated, in instrumentation of obstructed bile ducts, or with choledoschoscopy.

TI  == bacteriological analysis of jejunostomy fluid after surgery for extrahepatic biliary atresia.
AB  == quantitative cultures were made of jejunostomy fluid from 22 children with extrahepatic biliary atresia following hepatoportoenterostomy. bacterial flora characteristics did not differ in patients with or without cholangitis. with the  exception of streptococcus group d, the most frequently encountered bacterial species with the highest mean concentrations in the jejunostomy fluid, were those mostly responsible for cholangitis (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and  pseudomonas aeruginosa). in 19 of 22 acute episodes, the organism causing cholangitis identified in blood and/or liver was also isolated from jejunostomy fluid. however, quantitative determinations in this fluid did not permit reliable identification of this organism. when the same bacterium caused early relapse, it often persisted in the jejunostomy fluid.

TI  == direct dilution sampling, quantitation, and microbial assessment of open-system ventilation circuits in intensive care units.
AB  == in a systematic approach, 37 duplicate samples of open system circuits (bennett ma-1 ventilators) of patients in medical and surgical intensive care units were processed by direct and serial (apha guidelines) dilutions. the paired difference test on 15 of the in-use circuitry solution samples indicated no difference between the direct and serial dilution methods (p less than 0.001). seventy-seven additional respiratory therapy circuitry samples from similar intensive care patients were analyzed via a direct dilution method alone and processed microbiologically. the direct dilution procedure was a rapid and accurate means of evaluation of microbial contamination in the range of greater than or equal to 10 to less than or equal to 10(6) cfu/ml. high densities of organisms frequently  were found. sites of contamination included the proximal or patient end of the circuitry (heaviest), the nebulizer trap, and the distal or humidifier portions of the circuitry. the contaminants found were predominantly gram-negative nonfermenters: acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. antitratus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas maltophilia, and flavobacterium meningosepticum. fermenters were klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus sp., enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, and enterobacter agglomerans. infrequently, gram-positive streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus spp. were noted.

AB  == the influence of various 3-substituents on the antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[d-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids (iii) was investigated. introduction of an acidic substituent, such as a sulfo or a carboxyl group, to a 3-(1-methyl-1h-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent (iiif--i) resulted in a marked loss of activity against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter aerogenes, in contrast to an in crease of activity against proteus mirabilis. displacement of the acetoxy group of iiib with pyridines (iiim--p) enhanced the activity against p. aeruginosa and e. aerogenes: their activity against those strains were superior to that of the cephalosporin iiid having a 3-(1-methyl-1h-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent. as a result of extensive studies in addition to the study of in vitro activity in this series, 7 beta-[d-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1h-tetrazol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid,  code no. sm-1652, cefpiramide (generic name), was selected as a candidate for further biological and clinical investigations.

AB  == during the period from may through july 1981, a comparative study was carried out on the antibacterial activities of cefotaxime (ctx) and ceftizoxime (czx), cefoperazone (cpz), latamoxef (lmox), cefotiam (ctm), cefmetazole (cmz) and cefazolin (cez). ctx and these other cephem antibiotics were tested against fresh clinical isolates which had been obtained from clinical materials by the laboratories of 14 participating medical institutions. 1. the clinical isolates were obtained from various clinical materials in the following decreasing order:  urine, sputum and pus/discharge; 85.7% of the isolates came from these materials. 2. concerning the sources of each species of clinical isolates, it was found that p. aeruginosa was isolated from the greatest number -9- of different clinical materials. this was followed by e. coli and e. cloacae, each isolated from 8 different clinical materials, and c. freundii and e. aerogenes, each found in 7 different clinical materials. 3. in relation to s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae and s. pneumoniae, ctx showed the best antibacterial activity; the second most potent antibiotic was czx. cmz and lmox were found to show relatively high mic values for those species. against s. aureus, cez showed the best antibacterial activity, but 3 resistant strains had mics of greater than 100 micrograms/ml. 4. with regard to gram-negative bacteria, ctx and czx showed the best antibacterial activities for all of the species, except for p. aeruginosa. these were followed, in order, by lmox and cpz. compared with these 4 antibiotics, ctm, cmz and cez were found to have inferior antibacterial activities against these bacteria. in relation to p. aeruginosa, the peak of the mic distribution for cpz was 6.25 micrograms/ml, and this was the best antibacterial activity detected with the various antibiotics tested. this was followed by ctx (25 micrograms/ml) lmox (25  micrograms/ml) and czx (50 micrograms/ml). ctm had an mic of 100 micrograms/ml for 1 strain, and mics of greater than 100 micrograms/ml for all of the other strains of p. aeruginosa, indicating them to be resistant to this antibiotic. all of the strains were resistant to cmz and cez, showing mics of greater than 100 micrograms/ml. 5. for each of the tested antibiotics, no correlation was found between the mic and the serogroup for either p. aeruginosa or s. marcescens.

TI  == the clinical significance of positive blood cultures: a comprehensive analysis of 500 episodes of bacteremia and fungemia in adults. i. laboratory and epidemiologic observations.
AB  == five hundred episodes of septicemia were reviewed, with emphasis on laboratory and epidemiologic findings. the isolation of facultative and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, fungi, and gram-positive cocci (except viridans streptococci and staphylococcus epidermidis) almost always indicated true bacteremia, whereas the isolation of aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacilli, including clostridium species, often represented contamination. more than 99% of  all episodes were detected when two samples of blood (a total of 30 ml) were cultured. the five most common isolates were escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the incidence of septicemia was highest among medical patients and lowest among obstetric-gynecologic patients. two-thirds of all episodes were nosocomial; s. aureus, enterococci, facultative gram-negative bacilli, and fungi  were especially common nosocomial pathogens. the microorganisms isolated varied with the hospital service; polymicrobial episodes were especially common among surgical patients and transplant recipients. the most common sources of bacteremia were the respiratory, genitourinary, and gastrointestinal tracts; however, the source was unknown in nearly one-third of episodes. microorganisms causing septicemia in neutropenic and nonneutropenic patients were not different; however, polymicrobial infections were more frequent in the presence of neutropenia. after antimicrobial susceptibility data became available, therapy was appropriate greater than 90% of the time.

TI  == what do beta-lactamases mean for clinical efficacy?
AB  == beta-lactamases have proved to be extremely important in influencing therapy with penicillins and cephalosporins against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic species. both plasmid mediated beta-lactamases which are primarily  of a constitutive penicillinase type and the inducible chromosomal enzymes which  are primarily cephalosporinases are important. the use of penicillins to treat haemophilus, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella, salmonella, shigella and pseudomonas infections must be based upon the relative incidence of  beta-lactamase producing strains. in the same manner cephalosporins can be used to treat infections due to enterobacter, serratia and bacteroides only if the compounds are beta-lactamase stable and not good inducers of beta-lactamase activity. although altered permeability is important in the resistance of some pseudomonas and enterobacter to beta-lactams, the resistance really is due to a combination of reduced entry of molecules and strategically placed beta-lactamases. it is only in some streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis strains that altered penicillin-binding proteins make a significant contribution to the resistance to beta-lactams. beta-lactamases will continue to be the most important factor in clinically significant resistance of bacteria to both penicillins and cephalosporins.

TI  == laboratory evaluation of cefmenoxime: a new cephalosporin. in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities and pharmacokinetic properties.
AB  == cefmenoxime is a new syn-methoxyimino cephalosporin antibiotic derived from cefotiam, which has been proved to be a very effective and useful antibiotic for  the treatment of respiratory infections. this bacteriological and pharmacokinetic study was therefore performed in order to evaluate the potency of cefmenoxime in  the treatment of respiratory infections. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of cefmenoxime against 179 isolates of respiratory pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae 53, haemophilus influenzae 64, klebsiella pneumoniae 43, escherichia coli 9, enterobacter spp. 10) were less than 0.20 micrograms/ml, and 43 (73%) of  60 pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml. in vitro antibacterial activity of cefmenoxime was superior to 18 other antibiotics, including cefotiam and cefotaxime tested in this study. pharmacokinetic studies on tissue distribution in rats, serum levels and urinary excretion in 3 healthy volunteers, and penetration into bronchial secretes of 9 patients with respiratory infections, revealed that cefmenoxime has a higher penetration into the lung and bronchial secretes compared with cefotiam and cefotaxime. in 1 patient with chronic bronchiolitis, the concentration of cefmenoxime in the intra-bronchial secrete reached 12.5 micrograms/ml. from these results, it is concluded that cefmenoxime is a highly potent and useful antibiotic, and may be more effective in the treatment of respiratory infections than many other cephalosporins, including cefazolin, cefotiam and cefotaxime.

TI  == detection of fungemia obscured by concomitant bacteremia: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  == our recent clinical experience suggested that bacteremia may interfere with the detection of concomitant fungemia when standard blood culture methods are used. to determine the extent to which bacteria may interfere with fungal isolation from blood cultures, an in vitro model simulating blood cultures taken during concomitant fungemia and bacteremia was created. each of six bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) was combined with each of three pathogenic yeasts (candida albicans, candida tropicalis, and torulopsis glabrata) in vented blood culture bottles containing enriched brain heart infusion broth and fresh normal human blood. blood culture bottles were analyzed at 1, 2, and 7 days of incubation. gram strains and subcultures onto chocolate and macconkey agars failed to detect fungi in 37.0, 66.7, and 100% of samples, respectively. however, subcultures onto sabouraud dextrose agar failed in only 13% of the samples (occurring only with p. aeruginosa). in a rabbit model of concomitant fungemia with c. albicans and bacteremia with p. aeruginosa, no yeasts were recovered from blood cultures despite 100% detection of p. aeruginosa. therefore, the usual microbiological techniques may be inadequate to  detect fungemia when concomitant bacteremia is present.

TI  == determination of bacterial meningitis: a retrospective study of 80 cerebrospinal  fluid specimens evaluated by four in vitro methods.
AB  == a total of 80 cerebrospinal fluid specimens were analyzed for bacterial meningitis by four procedures readily available to most laboratories. these tests included routine culturing. gram staining, countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis,  staphylococcal coagglutination (coa) with laboratory-prepared reagents, and coa with pharmacia diagnostics reagents. a total of 56 specimens were positive for bacterial agents by routine culturing: gram stain results were positive for 64% of all specimens positive by culturing. for 36 specimens from patients with suspected meningitis due to either haemophilus influenzae type b, streptococcus pneumoniae, or group b streptococci, detection was 97% with pharmacia coa reagents, 94% with laboratory-prepared coa reagents, 89% with routine culturing,  78% with countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis, and 75% with gram staining. one specimen which contained klebsiella pneumoniae was false positive for s. pneumoniae in tests with both of the coa reagents and in countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis. a gram stain of this specimen clearly showed gram-negative bacilli, which were confirmed by culturing. although a positive culture and a positive gram stain are definitive evidence of bacterial meningitis, rapid immunological tests can provide valuable clinical information as an adjunct to culture and gram stain results. serological tests with pharmacia coa reagents produced more positive results than either laboratory-prepared coa reagents or countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis.

TI  == treatment of gram-negative bacillary meningitis: role of the new cephalosporin antibiotics.
AB  == results of the treatment of gram-negative bacillary meningitis have been disappointing: mortality is extremely high, and treatment with chloramphenicol has shown a high failure rate. this failure rate for chloramphenicol is consistent with the wide gap between minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration of this drug for escherichia coli, klebsiella, and other enterobacteriaceae. cefotaxime, a new cephalosporin, is cidal for most gram-negative bacteria at concentrations of less than 0.25 microgram/ml. by late  1981, 137 patients with meningitis due to a variety of bacteria had been treated  with this agent. bacteriologic cure rates were 93% for meningitis due to streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, and haemophilus influenzae and  88% for meningitis due to gram-negative bacteria (94.4% for meningitis due to e.  coli and klebsiella). this new antibiotic shows considerable promise in the treatment of these forms of meningitis.

TI  == clinical trials of cefotaxime for the treatment of bacterial infections of the lower respiratory tract.
AB  == the efficacy of cefotaxime sodium for treatment of patients with lower respiratory infections was evaluated by three protocols in multicenter trials. the first trial studied cefotaxime alone; the second and third trials compared cefotaxime with cefazolin in observer-blind and single-blind randomized controlled studies, respectively. a total of 656 patients were entered in the three trials; 527 received cefotaxime. overall rates of bacteriologic and clinical cure, analyzed by pathogen, for the cefotaxime treated patients were 89.9% and 93.9%, respectively. in the two comparative trials, overall rates of bacteriologic and clinical cure with cefotaxime, by pathogen, were greater than 94% and numerically exceeded those for cefazolin in each instance. the efficacies in the comparative studies, when analyzed by total patient responses, were significantly different only for clinical responses to cefotaxime in the single-blind randomized trial (p = 0.03). favorable cure rates with cefotaxime were obtained in patients with infections due to streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli, and nearly comparable responses were obtained for infections due to proteus, enterobacter, and klebsiella species. cefotaxime was clinically effective in some of the infections due to serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but bacteriologic failures occurred in 67% and 61% of cases, respectively. all serratia strains were highly susceptible in vitro to cefotaxime, but the range of minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefotaxime for  pseudomonas isolates was wide.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefmenoxime.
AB  == the activity of cefmenoxime, an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was studied against 650 bacteria. it was slightly less active than cefotaxime and more active than moxalactam against staphylococci. it had activity similar to that of cefotaxime and ceftizoxime against group a and b streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae.  it did not inhibit streptococcus faecalis or listeria spp. cefmenoxime had activity similar to that of cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftazidime, and moxalactam  against escherichia coli, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella, proteus mirabilis, salmonella, and shigella. it inhibited beta-lactamase-positive and -negative isolates at less than or equal to 0.4 microgram/ml. cefmenoxime was somewhat less active than moxalactam or ceftizoxime against enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter  aerogenes, and enterobacter agglomerans, but was more active than cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, or ceftazidime against morganella (minimum inhibitory concentration  for 90% of isolates, 0.1 microgram/ml.), proteus vulgaris and providencia spp. it was as active as ceftizoxime was against serratia. pseudomonas spp. and bacteroides spp. were relatively resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration for  90% of isolates, greater than 100 micrograms/ml). the compound was stable to the  common plasmid beta-lactamases, such as that of tem. it was stable to most chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, which act primarily as cephalosporinases, but was hydrolyzed by bacteroides and acinetobacter.

TI  == comparative review of two new wide-spectrum penicillins: mezlocillin and piperacillin.
AB  == the antimicrobial spectra, pharmacokinetics, tissue penetration, side effects, clinical trials and indications, dosage, and cost of mezlocillin (mezlin) and piperacillin (pipracil), two new semisynthetic beta-lactam penicillins, are reviewed. both mezlocillin and piperacillin are active against a wider range of bacteria than previously available penicillins, but their spectra are not identical. piperacillin is more active than mezlocillin against pseudomonas aeruginosa; their activities against klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, and bacteroides fragilis are similar to one another. neither drug is absorbed orally; both are well absorbed (60-70%) after i.m. injection. following  i.v. infusion or injection, both drugs distribute rapidly (distribution half-life = 10-20 min); neither is protein bound substantially. both drugs are primarily excreted unchanged in the urine by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. elimination half-lives of both drugs are slightly prolonged in renal-failure patients. however, the half-life of mezlocillin in renal failure is longer then the half-life of piperacillin because of dose-dependent kinetics of mezlocillin at low glomecular filtration rates. probenecid alters the disposition of both drugs. both drugs are widely distributed throughout the body. reported side effects are similar to those of other penicillins. mezlocillin and piperacillin may be used to treat susceptible organisms causing the following conditions: complicated and uncomplicated urinary-tract infections, septicemia, uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis, and lower respiratory-tract, intra-abdominal, gynecologic, skin, and skin-structure infections. piperacillin is also effective for bone and  joint infections. dosages of both antibiotics should be adjusted based on patients' clinical condition and renal status. both agents are relatively expensive in comparison with older penicillins and cephalosporins; their daily costs are similar to third-generation cephalosporins, carbenicillin, and ticarcillin. the potential benefits of mezlocillin and piperacillin are in their  extended in vitro spectra of activity and minimal toxicities. more comparative clinical trials are needed to support any claims of clinical superiority of these drugs over older, less expensive regimens.

TI  == gram-negative bacillary meningitis. new therapy and changing concepts.
AB  == because the csf is deficient in opsonic and phagocytic activity, optimal therapy  for meningitis mandates the use of antibiotics that are bactericidal at achievable csf concentrations. this therapeutic principles is satisfied for the common meningeal pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis) but is not readily achieved for the pathogens causing gram-negative bacillary meningitis (gnbm), such as klebsiella and escherichia coli. the antibiotics used to treat gnbm, chloramphenicol and aminoglycosides, are not bactericidal against enteric pathogens at achievable csf levels. two new  beta-lactam antibiotics, moxalactam disodium and cefotaxime sodium, are suitable  agents for the treatment of gnbm. these antibiotics possess potent bactericidal activity against most enteric pathogens and achieve high levels in the csf (15 to 35 micrograms/ml for moxalactam disodium and 2 to 10 micrograms/ml for cefotaxime sodium). recent clinical studies document an 85% cure rate when these agents are  used to treat gnbm.

AB  == the in vitro activity of n-formimidoyl thienamycin was determined against 800 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and compared with  the activity of cefoxitin, cefazolin, cefamandole, cefotaxime, moxalactam, ampicillin, cefoperazone, and gentamicin. n-formimidoyl thienamycin inhibited the majority of organisms at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml. it inhibited methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus faecalis. it inhibited beta-lactamase-producing haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae. unlike other new beta-lactams, it inhibited listeria. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacters, serratia, indole-positive proteus, acinetobacter, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides resistant to other agents were inhibited. there was minimal effect of inoculum size and aerobic versus anaerobic conditions, and serum had no effect on activity. most minimal bactericidal concentrations were two- or fourfold greater  than the minimal inhibitory concentration. n-formimidoyl thienamycin showed partial synergy with aminoglycosides against s. aureus, s. faecalis, and many pseudomonas and enterobacteriaceae. it was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated and chromosomal beta-lactamases.

TI  == influence of bacterial products on the motility of stallion spermatozoa.
AB  == sterile filtrates were prepared from equine isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae (genitalium), proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, streptococcus zooepidemicus, streptococcus equisimilis, actinobacillus equuli, and corynebacterium equi and mixed individually with extended stallion semen. when diluted in the extended semen the filtrates represented bacterial populations of 0.5 x 10(6), 1 x 10(6), 2 x 10(6) and 4 x 10(6) cells/ml. ph values were recorded for each filtrate. specimens were monitored for percentage motile spermatozoa at 30-min intervals until they reached 10% or less for 2 consecutive observations. all specimens were maintained at 25 degrees c in a water bath. ten specimens were examined from each of 5 clinically normal stallions. the major reduction in percentage motile spermatozoa as compared to the control sample occurred before the first observation. from this point the rate of deterioration in motility in the filtrates approximated that of the control. the differences detected between the filtrates and control in percentage motile sperm cells were all statistically significant at p less than 0.01.

TI  == effects of washing on the bacterial flora of the stallion's penis.
AB  == six stallions were subjected to extensive cleansing of the penis and prepuce with water, ivory soap and water, or betadine surgical scrub and water. the stallions  were all washed for 14 days, and then allowed 14 days respite. this pattern of washing and resting was repeated consecutively. swabs were taken from all 7 stallions twice weekly and semen was collected once a week for bacteriological examination. all forms of cleansing altered the bacterial flora of the stallion's penis; the ivory soap tended to encourage the replacement of the normal flora with coliform organisms, while betadine favoured the growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella spp. this experiment showed that the systematic washing of a stallion's penis will cause the normal flora to be replaced with pathogens and potential pathogens.

TI  == type-specific vs. cross-protective vaccination for gram-negative bacterial pneumonia.
AB  == groups of guinea pigs received four injections intramuscularly of lipopolysaccharide vaccine derived from pseudomonas aeruginosa, cross-protective  core glycolipid vaccine derived from the j-5 mutant of escherichia coli o111, or  saline during a two-week period. titers of passive hemagglutinating antibody to vaccine antigens in serum routinely increased fourfold or more. experimental hemorrhagic pseudomonas pneumonia was then induced, from which the rates of survival were 15% among animals receiving saline, 81% among animals receiving pseudomonas vaccine (p less than 0.001), and 42% among animals receiving j-5 vaccine. thus, only weak cross-protection against pseudomonas pneumonia was detected in the recipients of j-5 vaccine. further studies revealed no protection against pneumonia due to either e. coli or klebsiella in animals receiving j-5 vaccine. from these data, species-specific vaccination appears to be superior to  vaccination with cross-protective antigen against experimental pseudomonas pneumonia.

TI  == immunochemical relations between pneumococcal group 19 and klebsiella capsular polysaccharides.
AB  == pneumococcal type 19f polysaccharide, contained in the current u.s. licensed pneumococcal vaccine, is a poor immunogen in young children. capsular polysaccharides of klebsiella, reported to be cross-reactive with the pneumococcal type 19f, were isolated. immunochemical relations between pneumococcal group 19 and klebsiella capsular polysaccharides were studied by immunodiffusion with hyperimmune typing antisera, immune passive hemolysis, and plaque-forming cell response in mice following injection of polysaccharides. klebsiella k2, k9, k32, k47, and k48 polysaccharides were reported to cross-react with horse pneumococcal type 19 antiserum by direct precipitation. however, these klebsiella polysaccharides did not react in immunodiffusion with horse or with rabbit pneumococcal 19f and 19a typing antisera. furthermore, pneumococcal type 19f and 19a polysaccharides did not precipitate with rabbit k2, k9, k32, k47, and k49 typing antisera. the cross-reactivity of the klebsiella and pneumococcal polysaccharides was studied by 2 other methods. rabbit pneumococcal 19f antiserum induced by low passive hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes coated with klebsiella polysaccharides. in contrast, klebsiella typing antisera exhibited higher hemolytic activity with erythrocytes coated with type 19f polysaccharides. the cross-reactivity of k2 and pneumococcal 19f polysaccharides was also exhibited by the direct igm plaque-forming cell response. the cross-reactivity, determined by  precipitin reactions using animal antisera, may not predict the cross-immunogenicity of purified polysaccharides in humans.

TI  == peritonitis in cirrhotic patients with leveen shunts.
AB  == six cirrhotic patients are described in whom peritonitis developed from 10 days to 15 months after the insertion of a leveen shunt. the presenting clinical features of fever, increasing ascites and deterioration in mental status resembled these previously reported for cirrhotic patients but with spontaneous peritonitis without shunts. important differences were observed, however, in microbiology, incidence of bacteremia and therapy. staphylococcus aureus, a rare  cause of spontaneous peritonitis, was found in one half of our cases, suggesting  that perioperative contamination during shunt placement was an important etiologic factor. all six had concomitant bacteremia which may be attributable to the direct peritoneal-venous connection. appropriate systemic antimicrobial therapy without shunt removal failed to eradicate the infection irrespective of the patency of the shunt or absence of inflammation at the sites of insertion. recommended treatment for suspected peritonitis in patients with shunts is systemic antimicrobial therapy with an agent active against staphylococci plus an aminoglycoside, followed by removal of the shunt if the diagnosis is confirmed.

TI  == causes of pneumonia presenting to a district general hospital.
AB  == the incidence of bacterial, viral, mycoplasma, and rickettsial infections has been assessed prospectively in 210 adult patients with pneumonia who presented to a district hospital over a six-year period. one hundred and thirteen infective agents were detected in 103 patients. the agent most frequently detected was mycoplasma pneumoniae which accounted for 30 infections. a bacterial pathogen was found in 43 patients. streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common of these (24 patients); staphylococcus aureus (eight), haemophilus influenzae (four), klebsiella spp (three), and legionella pneumophila (three) were all less common.  chlamydial or rickettsial infections (psittacosis or q fever) were detected in nine patients. viral infections were found in 31 patients (22 influenza a, four influenza b, two parainfluenza, and three respiratory syncytial virus). there were 10 patients in whom more than one pathogen was identified. in 107 patients no pathogens could be identified. seventy-five per cent of these patients had either received antibiotics before entering hospital, or were unable to produce any sputum for culture. the incidence of bacterial pneumonia has probably therefore been underestimated. nevertheless this survey does emphasise the importance of m pneumoniae as a pathogen in patients with pneumonia presenting to hospital.

TI  == comparative in vitro study in new cephalosporins.
AB  == three new cephalosporins, ceftazidime, ceftizoxime, and cefotiam, were evaluated  in vitro against clinical isolates, and their activities were compared with those of other cephalosporins, mezlocillin, and tobramycin. all three new cephalosporins were very active against gram-positive cocci (except enterococci), but mezlocillin was more active against streptococcus ssp. cefotiam and cefamandole were the most active antibiotics against streptococcus aureus. ceftazidime had broad-spectrum activity against all gram-negative bacilli tested, except enterobacter spp. ceftizoxime was active against all, except enterobacter  spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa. although cefotiam was quite active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, it was inactive against indole-positive proteus spp., serratia spp, and p. aeruginosa. the in vitro activity suggests that ceftazidime should prove useful as a broad-spectrum  antibiotic, in those settings in which the most likely pathogens are gram-negative bacilli.

TI  == in vivo activity of ceftriaxone (ro 13-9904), a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic  cephalosporin.
AB  == ceftriaxone (ro 13-9904) was compared with other newer beta-lactam antibiotics for activity in experimental infections of mice with enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and gram-positive bacteria. overall, ceftriaxone was equal or superior to cefotaxime and cefoperazone against systemic infections. all three drugs were highly potent against most organisms but were considerably less active against p. aeruginosa. however, ceftriaxone tended to be more active than the other two agents against 8 of the 10 p. aeruginosa strains tested. ceftriaxone, cefmenoxime (sce 1365), and moxalactam were all highly active against systemic infections with 16 strains of enterobacteriaceae, whereas ceftriaxone was more active against infections with two strains of streptococci. when the drugs were administered at various time intervals before infection, ceftriaxone was superior to cefotaxime, cefmenoxime,  and moxalactam. this suggested that ceftriaxone might be eliminated from mice more slowly than the other drugs. in the case of cefotaxime, this was directly confirmed by microbiological assays of plasma samples. in a murine meningitis model induced by klebsiella pneumoniae or streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftriaxone was more active than ampicillin or cefotaxime. ceftriaxone was more active than ampicillin, cefotaxime, piperacillin, cefamandole, or carbenicillin in a pneumococcal, pneumonia model in mice. these studies indicate that ceftriaxone is a potent, broad-spectrum cephalosporin with unusual pharmacokinetic properties.

AB  == the oropharyngeal and fecal flora in 33 patients hospitalized with acute leukemia was examined. normal flora predominated on admission. all patients received chemotherapy during the 48 hr after admission and at least one course of antibiotics during hospitalization. by the end of the study, 68% of the initial normal throat flora and 57% of the fecal flora had disappeared. the shift in flora was mainly due to the persistence or acquisition of aerobic gram-negative bacilli. before antibiotics were given, the normal flora in both sites had already decreased in quantity, and increased numbers of aerobic gram-negative bacilli were found. after the first course of antibiotics, a further decrease in  the total number of normal strains was observed. information obtained from surveillance cultures was helpful for understanding the changes in flora but did  not correlate with the microbiology of the infectious processes and could not be  used to predict infection.

TI  == pathological study of infective endocarditis on hancock porcine bioprostheses.
AB  == a pathological study has been performed on 10 infected hancock bioprostheses removed from nine patients who died of prosthetic endocarditis. the devices had been in place from 2 to 87 months (average 37.5), the interval between operation  and onset of infection averaging 30 months. the offending organisms were gram negative bacteria in three patients (klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and serratia marcescens), gram positive bacteria in two (staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus viridans), and fungi in four (candida species in three and aspergillus species in one). gross examination of the explants revealed in most cases a vegetative endocarditis of one porcine valve leaflets. septic embolization occurred in five cases owing to the high friability of the vegetations. prosthetic valve incompetence was the commonest type to dysfunction  observed because of tears, perforations, and even complete destruction of the cusps. prosthetic valve stenosis following obstruction of the valve orifice by infected polypous masses was noted in two cases. clumps of infective organisms were detected deep in the cusp tissue in most cases on histologic examination. infection located on the paraprosthetic tissues, associated with ring abscess, valve detachment, and insufficiency, was observed only once. according to the results of investigation, endocarditis on porcine bioprostheses is associated with a better preserved native valvular ring as viewed at reoperation. therefore  surgical intervention appears appropriate in the presence of severe hemodynamic complications after adequate antibiotic treatment. however, infection of these particular prostheses still carries an extremely high mortality. in the present series, this poor outcome might be explained by the frequently associated septic  and thromboembolic events.

AB  == the two pathogenic species streptococcus pneumoniae and klebsiella pneumoniae were used to analyze the immunogenic role of proteins in ribosomal preparations.  the protective activity of ribosomes prepared from either strain and further purified by washing with high-salt concentrations, followed or not by sucrose gradient separation of the particles, was identical to that of crude unwashed ribosomes. similarly, no substantial alteration of the level of protection was observed after treatment with the antibiotic puromycin. therefore, the immunizing efficacy of ribosomes does not appear to be due either to the nonribosomal proteins adsorbed at the surface of organelles or to the growing polypeptide chain. it seems rather to be attributable to the structural ribosomal proteins themselves, which were indeed shown to induce alone a significant level of protection.

TI  == cefmenoxime (sce-1365), a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin: in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities.
AB  == the activity of cefmenoxime (sce-1365), 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-(z)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1h-tetraz ol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, was compared with that of other cephalosporins. cefmenoxime exhibited high activity against a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime against streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, and enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive proteus, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, and citrobacter freundii, was 10 to 1,000 times greater than that of several other cephalosporins. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, cefmenoxime showed activity two to four times that of sulbenicillin and carbenicillin but less than that of cefsulodin. variation in ph, addition of horse serum, and type of growth medium had definite effects on the activity of cefmenoxime, and the inoculum size affected the activity against bacterial species. in escherichia coli cefmenoxime  showed marked affinity for penicillin-binding protein 3 (pbp-3), followed by pbp-1 (1a and 1b). this affinity profile was well correlated with its filamentous cell-forming activity under extremely low drug concentrations and with its bactericidal activity against microorganisms. the high in vitro activity of cefmenoxime was reflected in the degree of protection observed in mice infected intraperitoneally with a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. furthermore, cefmenoxime showed good therapeutic activity against infection models in mice such as respiratory tract infection caused by klebsiella pneumoniae and urinary tract infection caused by proteus mirabilis.

TI  == bb-k 122: in vitro and in vivo activity against ocular pathogens.
AB  == bb-k 122 is a new aminoglycoside antibiotic and an analogue of amikacin. this study evaluated the in vitro and in vivo activity of bb-k 122 and gentamicin against important ocular pathogens. bb-k 122 and gentamicin demonstrated generally equivalent in vitro antibacterial activity, except that gentamicin was  more active against streptococcus sp. bb-k 122 showed significant in vitro activity against important ophthalmic pathogens, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and species of klebsiella, escherichia, proteus, haemophilus, and moraxella. solutions of bb-k 122 (1%) and gentamicin sulfate (0.3%) were compared in an experimentally induced rabbit keratoconjunctivitis model. rabbit eyes infected with p. aeruginosa or s.  pneumoniae were treated with one of the two antibiotic formulations and evaluated after 24 h. a topical formulation of 1% bb-k 122 was at least as effective as gentamicin sulfate (0.3%) solution against these infections.

TI  == postantibiotic suppression of bacterial growth.
AB  == persistent suppression of bacterial growth following exposure of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to numerous antimicrobial agents was studied. the persistent, or postantibiotic, effect was quantitated by periodic counts of colony-forming units after removal of the drug by washing, dilution, or inactivation with penicillinase. although a postantibiotic effect was observed with all drugs studied, there were marked differences among drugs in their postantibiotic effects on certain organisms. with gram-positive organisms, concentrations of beta-lactam antibiotics near the minimal inhibitory concentration produced persistent effects lasting 1-3 hr. with gram-negative organisms much higher concentrations were required to elicit a postantibiotic effect. inhibitors of protein and rna synthesis produced the longest persistent suppression of growth, which was of comparable duration in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. only a short persistent effect of gentamicin was observed with staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli, but a postantibiotic effect lasting 1.6-2.6 hr was observed with pseudomonas aeruginosa. the duration of the  postantibiotic effect was related linearly to concentration of drug and duration  of exposure up to a point of maximal response. persistent effects following exposure to antibiotics were also demonstrated in 90% human serum.

TI  == effect of csf on bacterial growth.
AB  == the growth patterns of five potentially pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, group b beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and klebsiella pneumoniae) and a commonly encountered, nonpathogenic microorganism (s epidermidis) were compared using csf, trypticase soy broth (tsb), and a phosphate buffer. each grew less in csf than in tsb. escherichia coli was least affected with a median difference of 2 logarithms between csf and tsb at 24 hours of growth, whereas s epidermidis was markedly inhibited, with a median difference of 6.85 logarithms. the differences among the remaining four organisms ranged from 3.86 to 5.94 logarithms, all significantly greater than that for e. coli. similar results were obtained at 48 hours of growth. the non-support of bacterial growth by csf may constitute a host defense  mechanism. the basis of these observations may be the presence of inhibitors or the absence of nutrients required for bacterial growth in the csf.

TI  == protective effects of s-sulfonated human gamma globulin against experimental infections in mice.
AB  == s-sulfonated gamma globulin (ggs), newly developed as a safe drug for intravenous use, was studied for its protective effects against some experimental infections  in mice. gamma globulin showed a good protective activity against infections due  to streptococcus pneumoniae and escherichia coli and was moderately active against infections due to staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in most cases, the potency of ggs was almost the same as that of original native gamma globulin. the duration of ggs activity in vivo was found to be comparable to that of native gamma globulin and much higher than that of pepsin-digested gamma globulin. in the control of infection due to e. coli, specific antibody was found to play a central role in the antibacterial action of ggs. when ggs was administered in combination with the antibiotics gentamicin and cefazolin for the control of infections due to s. pneumoniae or e. coli, a clear synergistic effect was observed.

TI  == [fundamental and clinical studies of cefoperazone in children (author's transl)].
AB  == as a result of conducting experimental and clinical tests with the newly developed cephalosporin, cefoperazone (cpz), the following conclusions were obtained: (1) when tested against 10 strains of staphylococcus aureus and 16 strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, the antibacterial activity of cpz was found to be weaker than that of cez. against 5 strains of a-beta-streptococcus and 4 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, both cpz and cez exhibited similar excellent antibacterial activity. cpz was effective against 18 strains of escherichia coli though its activity was influenced by the amount of inoculated bacteria present. against 15 strains of haemophilus influenzae and 10 strains of  haemophilus parahaemolyticus, cpz was found to be more effective than cez though  several high-resistant strains were noted. cpz also showed more excellent antibacterial activity than cez against 4 strains of haemophilus parainfluenzae,  5 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 strains of salmonella sp., 4 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 4 strains of proteus sp. (2) the mean half-life in the blood following intravenous injections of 25 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of cpz to three children was 70 minutes. (3) one hour after intravenous injection of 25 mg/kg of  cpz to 3 cases of aseptic meningitis, drug concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) was 1.20 mcg/ml, less than 0.39 mcg/ml and 1.55 mcg/ml. in one case,  the csf/serum ratio was 2.7%. (4) the average recovery rate in the urine of children who had received intravenous administrations of 25 mg/kg (3 children) and 10 mg/kg (1 child) was 17.8% between 0 and 6 hours. (5) eighteen pediatric patients received cpz in doses ranging from 48 to 170 mg/kg divided three-four times a day. they were rti in 7, uri in 5, uti in 5, ssss in 1 and enteritis in 1 children. the clinical effectiveness of cpz was judged to be remarkedly effective in 11 children, effective in 5 children and ineffective in 3 children, with an overall effective rate of 84.2%. one patient of tonsillitis combined sinusitis was considered 2 cases. the three cases in which the drug was found to e ineffective were 2 cases of pyothorax and 1 case of sinusitis. (6) side effects were 1 case of eosinophilia, 2 cases of elevation of got and gpt, and 1 case of mild elevation of got. all were considered to be minor.

TI  == indirect sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for rapid detection of streptococcus pneumoniae type 3 antigen.
AB  == an indirect sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of the polysaccharide antigen of type 3 pneumococcus (sss-iii) is reported. polystyrene  balls with attached anti-sss-iii antibody serve as the solid phase, and antigen is detected using an alkaline phosphatase-labeled antiglobulin conjugate. the reaction is quantitated by spectrophotometry. concentrations of antigen are estimated by comparison with standard curves prepared with purified sss-iii. for  this assay, the practical lower limit of detection of sss-iii is approximately 2  to 3 ng/ml, thus making the test sensitivity about 25 times that reported for counterimmunoelectrophoresis. in preliminary tests with simulated human clinical  specimens, none of the body fluids tested (spinal fluid, serum, urine, and sputum) interfered with detection of antigen, nor did they produce false-positive or false-negative results. streptococcus pneumoniae type 3 whole organisms were readily detected in simulated clinically positive sputum specimens. cross-reactions were not observed with haemophilus influenzae type b, group b streptococcus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa.

AB  == antibody-coated bacteria tests, using fluorescein-conjugated rabbit anti-canine immunoglobulin (ig)g and anti-iga, were conducted on 77 specimens of bladder urine obtained by antepubic cystocentesis from 25 dogs with urinary tract infections. urine specimens from 3 dogs infected with staphylococcus aureus were  tested a total of 27 times, specimens from 10 dogs infected with escherichia coli were tested 25 times, urine from 6 dogs infected with proteus mirabilis was sampled and tested 18 times, urine from 3 dogs with klebsiella pneumoniae was sampled and tested 4 times, and specimens from 3 dogs infected with p rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, or streptococcus faecalis were tested once each. specimens  of urine from the renal pelves of each dogs were obtained by percutaneous nephropyelocentesis at the same time as the specimens of bladder urine. the results of bacterial cultures of these specimens were compared with the results of the corresponding antibody-coated bacteria tests. false-positive results (ie,  evidence of antibody coating of bladder urine bacteria but no bacterial growth from corresponding renal pelvis urine specimens) were obtained in 13 of 22 (59%)  tests of dogs infected with s aureus, 12 of 13 (92%) tests in dogs infected with  p mirabiis, 5 of 18(28%) tests in dogs infected with e coli, and 1 of 4 (25%) tests in dogs infected with k pneumoniae. false-negative results (ie, bacterial growth from renal pelvis urine specimens but no evidence of antibody coating of bacteria in the corresponding specimen of bladder urine) occurred in 5 of 7 (71%) specimens infected with e coli, in 4 of 5 (80%) specimens infected with p mirabilis, and in 5 of 5 (100%) specimens infected with s aureus. it was concluded that the antibody-coated bacteria test does not provide accurate information to support the diagnosis of pyelonephritis in the dog.

TI  == interaction between environmental pollutants and respiratory infections.
AB  == the major aspects that must be considered in studies of the health effects of environmental pollutants are: the direct damage due to the exposure, the role of  pre-existing disease, and effects of the exposure on the response to secondary stresses. in experimental studies at concentrations of air pollutants found in urban environments frank toxicological responses are rarely observed. however, exposure to a secondary stress, i.e. respiratory challenge with infectious bacteria, can exacerbate the response of the experimental host. changes in the resistance to respiratory infections provide a highly sensitive experimental animal model system, which is increasingly used in studies of health effects of air pollutants. this model indicates the impairment of the basic defense mechanisms of the respiratory system by the combined exposure to low concentrations of pollutants and the superimposed bacterial infection. changes in the resistance to respiratory infections were studied in various species of laboratory animals. s. pyogenes and k. pneumoniae are the bacteria of choice to induce the pulmonary infection. included in the studies are short-term single and multiple exposures as well as long-term exposures to gaseous pollutants such as o3 and no2 and particulate pollutants such as sulfates and nitrates. changes in the resistance are measured as excess mortalities and reduced survival time as compared to those in infected animals not exposed to the pollutants. other parameters measured ranged from changes in the immune response to changes in retention rates of bacteria in lungs.

TI  == abnormal colonization of neonates in an icu: conversion to normal colonization by pharyngeal implantation of alpha hemolytic streptococcus strain 215.
AB  == normal bacterial flora provide a natural defense mechanism against infection. our experience indicates that "normal" flora for the icu neonate contains alpha hemolytic (alpha-) streptococci as the predominant organism. the purpose of the current investigation is to study the feasibility of implanting a carefully selected, naturally occurring strain of alpha-streptococcus in the nasopharynx of neonates considered to be at high risk of infection because of the abnormal colonization of their pharynx with potential pathogens. twenty-two infants in the neonatal intensive care unit have received nasopharyngeal implantation with strain 215 alpha-streptococcus. in 16 infants, alpha-streptococci, including the  implant strain in pure or mixed alpha-streptococcal populations, constituted the  predominant pharyngeal flora within 48 to 72 hr of implantation. the implant strain was not recovered from the remaining six infants. the procedure was apparently innocuous in this small number of patients. we conclude that implantation of a streptococcus can be established in the pharynx of infants abnormally colonized with pathogenic organisms in high titer and that successful  implantation of strain 215 can result in prompt development of normal pharyngeal  flora, with alpha-streptococci predominant, within 48 hr. there has been no evidence of infection or other adverse reaction caused by the implant strain.

TI  == effect of contamination levels on antimicrobial susceptibilities tested by autobac i.
AB  == two gram-positive and five gram-negative species of bacteria commonly isolated from clinical specimens were used in 704 different inoculum ratios against 11 antimicrobial agents to study the effect of contamination levels on the susceptibility patterns of mixed cultures. staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae were used in 12 combinations of two each. the pure culture inoculum tubes were prepared according to autobac i (pfizer inc.) instructions. various amounts from 0.01 to 2.0 ml of one bacterial  inoculum were mixed with various amounts of the other bacterial inoculum to form  16 mixtures to low-thymidine eugonic broth. in the majority of cases, susceptibility to antimicrobial agents started to change at 12.5% contamination level. of 1,936 mixtures with 5% contamination levels, 98.5 to 99.2% exhibited the same susceptibilities as did the pure cultures. these results suggest that generally contamination levels of more than 5% or 70,000 to 150,000 bacteria per  ml, are responsible for a significant change in apparent drug susceptibility.

AB  == a single intraperitoneal injection of the phenol-treated cells of propionibacterium acnes into mice showed nonspecific resistance against subsequent lethal doses of an intraperitoneal challenge of klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes. the protection showed a biphasic pattern. the maximum protection, designated as the early phase protection, was seen in mice injected with p. acnes vaccine 1 to 2 days before the challenge, whereas the late phase protection was seen in mice vaccinated 16 to 22 days before the challenge. the activity of the reticuloendothelial system in mice after vaccination also showed a biphasic pattern with the peak on days 4  and 12. the delayed activation of the reticuloendothelial system lasted up to 3 weeks and coincided with the period of the late phase protection. the early phase resistance was markedly impaired by the treatment with hydrocortisone and carrageenan, but not by the treatment with anti-thymocyte serum, actinomycin d, or cyclophosphamide. the number of peritoneal polymorphonuclear leukocytes in vaccinated mice increased on days 1 to 2. the number of macrophages also increased at 2 to 21 days after vaccination and reached its maximum on day 14. total activities of acid phosphatase, nitro blue tetrazolium reduction, and the phagocytic activities of peritoneal exudate cells were also enhanced on and after day 1 after the injection of p. acnes vaccine.

AB  == a total of 91 multiply resistant bacterial strains, including klebsiella pneumoniae (32 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (16 strains), and serratia marcescens (43 strains), were collected during hospital epidemics of nosocomial infection from 1975 to 1979. these strains were resistant to gentamicin, tobramycin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin. their susceptibility to three new broad-spectrum beta-lactams, ly127935 (a 1-oxa-beta-lactam), cefotaxime (hr 756), and cefoperazone (t 1551), was compared with the susceptibility of random strains of nine species of aerobic gram-negative bacilli collected in the  same hospital in 1979. susceptibility to cefamandole and ticarcillin was also determined. strains of staphylococci and streptococci from that hospital and two  nearby city-county hospitals were also compared for the three new cephalosporins  and other effective antibiotics. the agar dilution method was used to measure the minimum inhibitory concentration for each antibiotic. the multiply resistant strains (minimum inhibitory concentration for gentamicin >/= 8 mug/ml) usually were as susceptible to the three new broad-spectrum beta-lactams as were non-multiply resistant strains. both klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia marcescens, including multiply resistant and non-multiply resistant strains, were most susceptible to the 1-oxa-beta-lactam ly127935 and cefotaxime. p. aeruginosa  (both multiply resistant and non-multiply resistant strains) were most susceptible to cefoperazone. all three new beta-lactams were active against non-multiply resistant strains of escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., proteus spp., and citrobacter spp. providencia stuartii were most susceptible to cefotaxime and the 1-oxa-beta-lactam ly127935. the three new beta-lactams were all less active against staphylococci (especially methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus) than cephalothin. streptococcus pyogenes and s. pneumoniae were very susceptible to cefotaxime and cefoperazone, though less susceptible to  ly127935. none of the three new beta-lactams was active against s. faecalis. all  were very active against both penicillinase-positive and -negative strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae.

AB  == although the strong association of hla-b27 with ankylosing spondylitis (as) is well documented, the significance of this association is largely unknown. it has  recently been reported that klebsiella pneumoniae was present in the faeces of patients with as more frequently than in healthy individuals, and that there appeared to be some cross-reactivity between hla-b27 and klebsiella. we have therefore attempted to gain an insight into the possible role of klebsiella in the pathogenesis of as. the results presented here indicate that hla-b27 positive individuals with as have a significantly lower in vitro lymphocyte responsiveness to klebsiella antigens, as compared with b27 positive and b27 negative healthy controls. by contrast, b27 positive patients with as as well as b27 positive and  negative controls respond equally well to phytohaemagglutinin, staphylococcus, streptococcus, yersinia and shigella. to investigate a possible cross-reactivity  between klebsiella and hla-b27, antisera were raised in rabbits against various isolates of klebsiella. an antiserum to one isolate (427) of klebsiella lysed the lymphocytes of b27 positive as patients but not of b27 positive or b27 negative controls. these observations strongly suggest that some klebsiella antigens cross-react with a gene product closely associated with hla-b27 or possibly with  a modified b27 antigen in patients with as.

AB  == the concentrations of secretory immunoglobulins in the saliva, and of immunoglobulin in the serum, have been measured by the radial immunodiffusion method in 12 healthy volunteers, before and after oral administration of broncho-vaxom which is a lysate of bacteria that usually cause infection in the upper respiratory tract. the mean concentration of secretory iga in the saliva was increased by over 100% after the 10-day administration of the product. this increase was statistically significant between the 20th and 33rd day after the beginning of the treatment (p < 0.05). it fell to a normal level after a month in 4 subjects who received one treatment course only. in 8 subjects who received a second treatment course beginning 1 month after termination of the first course,  the high concentration of igas in the saliva persisted for at least 3 months. a significant increase in the serum concentrations of igg of about 50% and of igm of at least 100% above the initial level was observed in the treated subjects in  the time between day 35 and 5 months after the beginning of the experiment (p < 0.05).

TI  == mastitis: ii. evaluation of antimicrobial amines for use as teat dips.
AB  == recent proposals by the food and drug administration to regulate teat dips as drugs have led to a search for safer teat dip ingredients. primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl amines (carbon-10 to -18 chain length) inhibit growth of mastitic bacteria (streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichi coli, klebsiella pneumoniae) in a broth tube culture assay. since carbon-13 compounds were active, a carbon-13 primary (tridecanamine hydrochloride), secondary methyl (n-methyltridecanamine), secondary ethyl (n-ethyltridecanamine), tertiary dimethyl amine (n, n-dimethyltridecanamine), and carbon-12 quaternary amine (n, n, -trimethyldodecaneammonium chloride) were tested for their ability to reduce experimentally applied populations of s. agalactiae or e. coli on the bovine teat surface. the five compounds were compared at concentrations of 100, 500, 1,000, 3,000, 7,000, and 10,000 ppm. activity was greater against the gram-positive s. agalactiae than against the gram-negative e. coli. the tertiary amine was most active, producing a log reduction of 4 (reduction of bacterial number from 10(6) to 10(2)) at a concentration of 3,000 ppm in the teat dip. the relative order of effectiveness for the amines was: dimethyl tertiary greater than methyl secondary greater than  ethyl secondary greater than primary = quaternary. the results suggest that these amines may be useful as potent, effective antibacterial agents for incorporation  into teat dips.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of moxalactam was studied in vitro against 229 clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic microorganisms using the agar dilution technique. mueller-hinton agar was used as growth medium. the results were compared to those obtained with cefamandole. all isolates of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by moxalactam at a concentration of 8 microgram/ml or less. the concentrations of cefamandole with which the same effect was obtained were 0.5 microgram/ml and 2 microgram/ml  respectively. moxalactam was highly inhibitory against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and proteus morganii - 90% of the strains were inhibited by 0.125 microgram/ml. moxalactam was highly superior against proteus rettgeri and pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are usually resistant  to cefamandole: the mic100 and mic90 were 0.25 microgram/ml and 8 microgram/ml respectively. high sensitivity was found in strains of salmonella species, nine of which were salmonella typhi: the mic90 was < 0.063 microgram/ml versus the eightfold higher concentration of cefamandole. the broad-spectrum activity and unusual mic patterns of moxalactam - eight or manyfold higher concentrations of cefamandole were needed to inhibit 90% of most gram-negative strains studied - make moxalactam an unusual and promising antibiotic.

AB  == we report the development and testing of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with excellent sensitivity for the detection of haemophilus influenzae type b (hi(b)) antigen in clinical specimens from patients with hi(b) meningitis. the assay, an indirect sandwich technique, uses polystyrene balls as a solid phase and an alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit globulin conjugate. specimens are incubated with polystyrene balls armed with burro anti-hi(b) antiserum, and recognition antibody is visualized by addition of alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-globulin, together with the enzyme substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate. concentrations of antigen are determined from standard curves prepared by using purified hi(b) capsular antigen polyribophosphate. the assay reproducibly detects polyribophosphate at concentrations between 1 and 5 ng/ml. cross-reactions have not as yet been encountered in simulated and authentic clinical specimens containing other species including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, group b streptococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, neisseria meningitidis, and listeria monocytogenes. in preliminary tests with 11 spinal fluid specimens, 2 serum specimens, and 5 urine specimens from patients with culture-proved hi(b) meningitis, antigen was detected in all specimens in concentrations ranging from  1 to 7,000 ng/ml. antigen was not detected in any of 62 clinical specimens which  were culture negative for hi(b), including 11 spinal fluid specimens from patients with bacterial meningitis caused by microorganisms other than hi(b). the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique described here is considerably simpler than radioimmunoassay and, based on concurrent tests with 14 positive clinical specimens, may be more sensitive than counterimmunoelectrophoresis. it seems, therefore, to hold considerable promise for clinical use in rapid detection of systemic hi(b) infections.

AB  == the oral flora of alcoholics, diabetics, and normal control subjects were compared using an agar overlay technique to determine whether the increased prevalence of oropharyngeal gram-negative bacilli among alcoholics and diabetics  exists because patients with these diseases have decreased numbers of normal inhibitory bacteria in the oropharynx. alcoholics generally had slightly lower concentrations of inhibitory bacteria than control subjects, and diabetics had somewhat higher concentrations than control subjects. however, colonized subjects did not differ from noncolonized subjects with respect to concentrations of these inhibitory bacteria in the oropharynx. characterization of inhibitory bacteria demonstrated a preponderance of nongroupable alpha-hemolytic streptococci in each of the study groups. stimulated saliva obtained from subjects failed to demonstrate significant differences in ph between study populations or between colonized and noncolonized subjects within each study population. these results suggest that the frequent oropharyngeal colonization of alcoholics and diabetics  by gram-negative bacilli involves mechanisms other than that of a deficiency of normal interfering aerobic bacteria in the oropharynx or an altered salivary ph leading to inactivation in vivo of bacteriocins produced by these inhibitory bacteria.

AB  == fifty consecutive episodes of septicemia were studied in 41 children who had acute lymphoblastic leukemia. seventy-six percent of these episodes occurred when the absolute granulocyte count was 200/mm3 or less and were caused by gram-negative enteric and gram-positive mucocutaneous bacteria. in eight patients, streptococcus pyogenes was isolated at the time when all was diagnosed. multiple anaerobic and aerobic isolates from a single blood culture were associated with abdominal distress, whereas streptococcus pneumoniae and hemophilus influenzae septicemia occurred in associated with respiratory illnesses. when patients with severe compromise of anatomic barriers or respiratory disease were excluded, 94% of all patients with septicemia had an agc of less than 200/mm3. the data provide guidelines for treatment for febrile patients with all based upon the agc, the phase of the disease, and on the presence of associated respiratory or abdominal findings.

TI  == minimal antibiotic concentrations of aminoglycosides and beta-lactam antibiotics  for some gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci.
AB  == the minimal antibiotic concentration (mac) is the lowest concentration of an antibacterial agent that produces a decrease of 1 log in the number of organisms/ml as compared with a control culture in drug-free medium. various gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci were grown in the presence of amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, oxacillin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and cefamandole at concentrations varying from eight  times the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) to 1/128 of the mic. colony forming units (cfu) were counted, the mic was determined, and the mic:mac ratio,  which indicates the magnitude of the effective range, was calculated. the mic:mac ratio appears to be characteristic for a given species and antibiotic. there is no relation between the mics and the mic:mac ratios. the highest ratios were given by proteus mirabilis with aminoglycosides (mic:mac mean, 29.2 with tobramycin), and the lowest ratios were given with beta-lactam antibiotics by pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus faecalis (mic:mac means, 2.1 with carbenicillin and cefamandole, respectively).

TI  == mastitis: i. in vitro antimicrobial activity of alkyl amines against mastitic bacteria.
AB  == the activities of branched and straight chain amines (10 to 18 carbons chain length) were compared in inhibiting the growth of five microorganisms that cause  about 95% of bovine mastitis. three gram-positive (streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, staphylococcus aureus) and two gram-negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria were used in a trypticase soy broth tube culture growth assay. sixty-two compounds were screened at concentrations of 200, 100, 50, 25, 10, 5, and 1 ppm in broth culture to determine the effective minimum inhibitory concentration. alkyl secondary n-substituted monoethyl [ch3(ch2)nnhch2ch3] and tertiary n,n-substituted dimethyl [ch3(ch2) nn(ch3)2] amines with chain lengths of 11 to 14 carbon atoms were active against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. antimicrobial activity against gram-positive organisms increased with increasing chain length and carbon-14 to 18 amines were active at 1 to 5 ppm. the carbon-11 to 13 alkyl amines were most active against gram-positive organisms; longer chain amines (more than 14 carbons) were inactive. branching of the alkyl chain caused a loss of activity against gram-negative but not against gram-positive bacteria. antimicrobial testing of monoamines, polyamines, and the influence of order substituents were investigated to correlate structure-acitivity relationships.

AB  == the in vitro activities of the newer semisynthetic penicillins azlocillin, mezlocillin, and piperacillin were compared with those of ampicillin and ticarcillin by using 290 clinical laboratory isolates. piperacillin and mezlocillin were the most active against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella spp., and enterobacter spp. when pseudomonas aeruginosa was tested, piperacillin and azlocillin were more active than either mezlocillin or ticarcillin. streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae species were highly susceptible to all of the penicillins tested. ticarcillin had relatively poor activity against enterococci. the rate of bacterial killing with multiples of the minimal inhibitory concentration of azlocillin, ampicillin, or ticarcillin was tested for e. coli, p. mirabilis, p. aeruginosa, and klebsiella spp. increasing concentrations increased the bactericidal effect. the effect of combining azlocillin, ampicillin, or ticarcillin with an aminoglycoside was studied by using both killing curves and checkerboards. the isobolograms constructed from the checkerboards showed a synergistic pattern for the organisms tested, which included e. coli, p. aeruginosa, klebsiella spp., p. mirabilis, and enterococci. however, the rate of killing was increased by the combination only for p. aeruginosa and enterococci.

AB  == a total of 19 pathogenic bacterial species was isolated from uterine swabs of 498 out of 1539 mares over 4 years. the swabs were taken by 5 veterinary clinicians using 2 different techniques. bacterial contamination during swabbing was minimized by scrupulous attention to cleansing of the external genitalia and the  perineal area, and in the handling of the culture specimen. the most prevalent organisms isolated were beta-haemolytic streptococcus (39%), escherichia coli (27%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (7%). interpretation of microbiological findings  correlated well with clinical findings when number of organisms isolated and endometrial cytology were considered. the use of a bacterial transport medium combined with sophisticated culture methods reflects a more accurate picture of the uterine microflora than can be obtained by previous techniques. streptococci  isolated were uniformly sensitive to penicillins. the sensitivity of e. coli and  k. pneumoniae towards chloramphenicol, gentamicin and polymyxin was nearly 100%.  the selection of an appropriate antibacterial agent depends upon sensitivity, pharmacological action, genital tract status and cost. this study shows that a gram stain of uterine cytology can be used to diagnose quickly and select an appropriate antibiotic for treatment prior to culture results if sufficient numbers of organisms are present.

AB  == an extract made from the supernatant of neisseria gonorrhoeae gc2 strain 1291 degraded the gc2 polysaccharide antigen. chemical analysis of this polysaccharide indicated it contains glucose, galactose, glucosamine, galactosamine, glucosamine-6-phosphate, heptose, 2-keto-3-deoxyotonate, and ethanolamine and is  the polysaccharide component of gonococcal lipopolysaccharide. degradation of the polysaccharide by sonic extracts resulted either in complete loss of antigenicity and immunogenicity or in partial degradation to subunits that could inhibit the gc2-specific hemagglutination inhibition. the factors responsible for degradation were destroyed by heating at 100 degrees c for 5 min or by pronase digestion, but were unaffected by ribonuclease, deoxyribonuclease, mg2+, ca2+, or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. the process was ph dependent, with optimal activity occurring at ph 7. sonic extract supernatants from group b and c meningococcal strains contained degrading properties, whereas similar extracts produced from escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and streptococcus pneumoniae type ii failed to degrade the gc2 polysaccharide.

TI  == antimicrobial activity in vitro of cefaclor, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cefaclor, a new orally administered cephalosporin derivative, was studied in vitro against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates. both penicillin-resistant and penicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to cefaclor, with mean mics of 1.44 and 0.93 microgram/ml, respectively. however, the mbc for penicillin-resistant s. aureus was higher than that for the penicillin-susceptible strains. all strains of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus viridans, and streptococcus pneumoniae tested were highly susceptible to cefaclor; all strains of streptococcus faecalis were highly resistant to cefaclor. strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., proteus mirabilis, and hemophilus influenzae were susceptible to cefaclor. eighty per cent of strains of h. influenzae were inhibited by 5 micrograms/ml of cefaclor. most strains of enterobacter sp., indole-positive proteus, pseudomonas sp., and serratia sp. were resistant to cefaclor.

TI  == bacterial infections, sensitivity patterns, and chemotherapy among hospital patients in the tropics.
AB  == a prospective clinical and bacteriological review of the pattern of bacterial infections and chemotherapy among 1931 patients admitted to university college hospital, ibadan, between july and september, 1976, showed that 394 patients (20%) had bacterial infections, but 940 patients (49%) received antimicrobial chemotherapy. thus 58% of the patients were treated either prophylactically or without bacteriological confirmation of infection. infections of the respiratory  tract were commonest (28%), followed closely by wound infections (26%). septicaemia accounted for 20% of all infections and this was particularly common  among children. there was a preponderance of infections due to gram-negative bacteria (69%), with klebsiella spp. being the most frequently encountered. among the gram-positive organisms, staphylococcus aureus accounted for the majority of  the infections, particularly infections of wounds, while salmonellae were responsible for the majority of septicaemias, except among young children, where  klebsiella spp. were predominant. approximately 90% of urinary tract infections were caused by klebsiella, escherichia coli and proteus spp. almost all the patients with meningitis were children (93%) and the commonest infecting organisms were haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae. the most commonly used antibiotics (penicillin, streptomycin and ampicillin) did not bear  a close relationship to the sensitivity patterns of bacteria causing infections in the hospital. comparison of the bacterial sensitivity patterns for 1963, 1967, 1974 and 1976 showed that the current usage of antibiotics had led over the years to increasing proportions of resistant organisms.

AB  == between january 1976 and march 1977, cerebrospinal fluid samples from 2130 patients at university college hospital, ibadan, nigeria were examined, 130 patients were shown to have pyogenic meningitis. the commonest causative bacteria were streptococcus pneumoniae (53.8%), haemophilus influenzae (23%), neisseria meningitidis (7.7%) and klebsiella spp. (3%). most of the infections occurred in  very young children: 47% of all patients were under 1 year of age, and 69% were under 5 years old. the overall case fatality rate was 30% (strep. penumoniae infection 28.6%, h. influenzae and n. meningitidis infection both 20%). all 4 patients with klebsiella infection died. there was a noticeable increase in the incidence of strep. pneumoniae strains showing resistance to tetracycline, between 1974 and 1976, and this was attributed to the widespread use and abuse of the antibiotic among the general population. two strains of h. influenzae were found to be resistant to ampicillin; such strains have not previously been reported from nigeria. the results of the study support the use of a combination  of ampicillin and gentamicin in the initial treatment of pyogenic meningitis in ibadan.

TI  == clinical experience with cefadroxil in upper and lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  == cefadroxil is a new semisynthetic oral cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. absorption of cefadroxil is unaffected by food, its serum levels are prolonged and it is excreted in the urine at a relatively slow rate compared to cephalexin. in the treatment of 108 patient with upper or lower respiratory tract infections, cefadroxil effected 93% complete cures. fifty-five of the patients had upper respiratory tract infections and fifty-three had lower respiratory tract infections; among them cefadroxil acheived clinical success rates of 100% and 96%, respectively. cefadroxil was clinically successful in eight (89%) out of nine patients whose infections were caused by mixed aetiologies. the principal causative agents were staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae and klebsiella pneumoniae. overall bacterial eradication produced by cefadroxil was 112 (91%) of 123 organisms isolated from 108 patients. reports of mild and transient side-effects in only 3.7% of the patients showed that the drug was well tolerated.

AB  == piperacillin (t-1220) is a new semisynthetic penicillin with an unusually broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. in vitro comparisons of this drug with 6 other beta-lactam antimicrobics (ticarcillin, carbenicillin, ampicillin, cephalothin, cefamandole and cefoxitin) were conducted. these included minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) against 394 bacterial isolates, the minimal lethal concentrations (mlc) against 79 of those, as well as the effect of inoculum size on the mic and mlc of the drugs. piperacillin had significantly greater activity than did the other penicillins against pseudomonas species and klebsiella pneumoniae. against p. aeruginosa piperacillin was 8- and 16-fold more active than ticarcillin and carbenicillin, respectively. the mlc of piperacillin  rarely differed from the mic by more than one log2 dilutions except against p. aeruginosa in which the mlc was 4-fold greater or more than the mic of 45% of isolates tested. ticarcillin, carbenicillin and cefoxitin showed minimal inoculum size effects. cefamandole results showed the greatest inoculum size variation with 55% and 37% of isolates showing an 8-fold increase in mic and mlc respectively by increasing inoculum from 10(5) to 10(7) cfu/ml. piperacillin was  intermediately effected having 25% of strains greater than 8-fold increase in mic.

AB  == the four isomers of hydroxycitrate have been tested as substrates and inhibitors  for citrate synthase, citrate lyase, and atp citrate lyase. none of the isomers served as a substrate for citrate synthase and they were moderate to weak inhibitors of this reaction. of the four isomers, only (pncit)-(2s)-2-hydroxycitrate did not serve as a substrate for citrate lyase while (pncit)-(4s)-4-hydroxycitrate was the only isomer which did not serve as a  substrate for atp citrate lyase. no consistent pattern of reactivity or inhibitor potency was seen with the different isomeric hydroxycitrates. it is proposed that more than one mode of binding is possible between the isomers and the three different active sites.

TI  == the syndrome of post-splenectomy fulminant sepsis. case report and review of the  literature.
AB  == three years after splenectomy, a middle-aged woman had two separate episodes of fulminant bacterial sepsis. she recovered each time with prompt and appropriate treatment. her immunologic system was examined and found to be normal with respect to antibody formation against diphtheria and tetanus toxoid, granulocyte  killing of staphylococci and serum opsonizing activity. granulocytes, bursa-equivalent (b) and thymus-dependent (t) lymphocytes and serum immunoglobulins were quantitatively normal. she produced antibody against subcutaneously injected polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine. she demonstrated cutaneous anergy. the literature on this syndrome was reviewed in an attempt to ascertain why hyposplenic patients are subject of fulminant bacterial, chiefly pneumococcal, sepsis. the probably explanation is the delayed production of antibodies against the phagocytic-resistant capsule of certain bacteria which the host had not previously encountered. the incidence of this syndrome appears to be on the order of 0.5 to 1.0%/year for splenectomized older children and adults. as the syndrome is seen chiefly in splenectomized or othewise hyposplenic patients,  a causal relationship seems to exist.

AB  == in a dairy herd with a low incidence of intrammary infections due to streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus, clinical mastitis remained a  serious problem despite good control of nonclinical mastitis through postmilking  teat disinfection and antibiotic therapy of known infected quarters at the end of lactation. during the 2-year study, the incidence of clinical mastitis was 0.88 cases/cow-year; 32.2% were caused by streptococcal species other than str agalactiae and 33.5% by gram-negative organisms. among all new infections detected, 54.1% were caused by streptococcal species other than str agalactiae and 25.7% by gram-negative bacteria. among new infections, 41.6% occurred during  the nonlactating period or within a few days of calving. incidence of clinical mastitis was highest in the 1st month of lactation. among 84 gram-negative infections, 42.8% were caused by klebsiella pneumoniae, 20.2% by escherichia coli, and 23.8% by enterobacter spp. among the many serotypes of k pneumoniae and e coli, none was predominant.

TI  == determinants of lung bacterial clearance in mice after acute hypoxia.
AB  == net lung bacterial clearance in normal mice is determined by the balance of in vivo bacterial multiplication on the one hand, and the defense mechanisms of mucociliary clearance and phagocytosis and killing by the oxygen-dependent alveolar macrophage on the other. the bactericidal function of the macrophage is  the major component of the defense mechanism. the effect of acute hypoxia on the  defense mechanism was studied in mice exposed to aerosols of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and streptococcus pneumoniae. physical clearance was not impaired by acute hypoxia, and bacterial replication was not stimulated by the low oxygen atmosphere. clearance of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli was impaired during acute hypoxia due to decreased phagocytosis or killing by the alveolar macrophage. the  important human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae was cleared normally in the presence of acute hypoxia. this observation suggests that an oxygen-independent clearance mechanism is important in lung defense against the pneumococcus. this may be a separate mechanism within the alveolar macrophage or a system as yet unidentified.

TI  == general principles of antimicrobial therapy.
AB  == in the initial therapy of life-threatening infections in which a bacterial cause  is suspected, the emphasis should be on broad antibiotic coverage in contrast to  definitive therapy, which is dependent on microbial isolation and, when indicated, in vitro susceptibility tests. in severe infections, antimicrobial agents should be given parenterally, at least initially. the need for optimal dosage is emphasized. this is particularly important when aminoglycosides are administered, for there is a tendency to use inadequate dosage because of concern for potential side effects with these agents. the problems leading to recurrence  and persistence of fever during antimicrobial therapy include failure to diagnose and drain abscesses, superinfection, drug fever, and clinical or microbiologic errors. combinations of antibiotics are indicated in severe infections in severe  infections due to pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcal group d streptococci, klebsiella pneumoniae, and cryptococcus neoformans. laboratory aid for the selection of antimicrobial therapy can be of great value but need not always be done, because certain microorganisms have stable, predictable susceptibilities, for example, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. cautious conservatism is advocated with regard to the use of new antimicrobial agents.

AB  == the ability of several bacterial species to adhere to human nasal mucosal cells and their distribution on nasal mucosal surfaces was studied. staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, and pseudomonas aeruginosa adhered to scraped nasal mucosal cells. in contrast, viridans streptococci and klebsiella pneumoniae exhibited feeble or no adherence to nasal  mucosal cells. s. aureus affinity for the nasal mucosal cells of carriers of s. aureus was greater than for those of the noncarriers (p less than 0.005). heat treatment of s. aureus did not block, but slightly reduced, its binding to mucosal cells. the data suggest a high degree of specificity involved in the adherence of bacteria to nasal mucosal cells. the greater affinity of s. aureus for the nasal mucosal cells of carriers (than noncarriers) seems to be a property of mucosal cells rather than bacteria.

TI  == cross-protective immunity to gram-negative bacilli: studies with core glycolipid  of salmonella minnesota and antigens of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == two immunoprophylactic approaches to the control of infections caused by gramnegative bacilli were evaluated by study of experimental infections in animals. the core glycolipid antigen derived from the re mutant of salmonella minnesota r595 is shared by virtually all enteric bacteria, and immunization with this endotoxin protects against the hemodynamic sequelae of bacterial infection and pyrexia without enhancing intravascular clearance of bacteria. the degree of  protection afforded by active and passive immunization with core glycolipid was significantly less than that conferred by type-specific immunization. escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae share capsular antigens with some strains of streptococcus pneumoniae; by the mechanism of enhanced opsonization, antibodies to s. pneumoniae may cross-protect against infection with e. coli or k. pneumoniae.

AB  == the resistence of different microorganisms to formaldehyde was determined. as test objects served gram-negative and gram-positive vegetative germs (klebsiella  pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella paratyphi-b, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis), bacterial spores (bacillus cereus, bacillus pumilus, bacillus stearothermophilus, bacillus subtilis), fungi (aspergillus niger, candida albicans), bacteriophages (escherichia coli phages, t1, t2, t3), and viruses (adenovirus, poliomyelitis virus, vaccinia virus). for the studies, suspensions of germs were exposed at identical temperature (20 degrees c) and ph  (7.0). the microbicidal effect of formaldehyde was measured by the decrease of the proportion of germs capable of multiplication in the suspension (lg (n/n0); where: n0 equals initial number of germs capable of multiplication; n equals number of germs capable of multiplication after exposure to formaldehyde). for all germs the dependence of the microbicidal effect on the concentration of formaldehyde was determined. in all experiments, the duration of exposure was two hours. pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and salmonella paratyphi-b  were found to be more susceptible than staphylococcus aureus (vf. fig. 1 a). the  strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa used were widely varying as to their susceptibility. to obtain equal microbicidal effects, concentrations of formaldehyde almost three times as high had to be used for the most resistant strain than were necessary for the most susceptible strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa. all strains of klebsiella pneumoniae examined were found to have an identical resistence to formaldehyde. streptococcus faecalis was even more resistant to formaldehyde than staphylococcus aureus. in the case of streptococcus faecalis, a concentration of formaldehyde about three times as high had to be used to obtain microbicidal effects of identical magnitude. for the killing of candida albicans cells concentrations of formaldehyde not higher than  those needed for the killing of vegetative gram-negative bacteria were necessary. the conidia of aspergillus niger were found to be more resistant than the cells of candida albicans but did not require any higher concentrations than for the killing of staphylococcus aureus (see fig. 1 b). in the case of bacterial spores, a special phenomenon was observed. if the spores had been exposed to a temperature of 80 and 95 degrees c, respectively (depending on the species involved) for one or two hours following exposure to formaldehyde, a considerably higher number of spores was found to be capable of germination and colony formation than without such treatment (heat activation: cf. fig. 2a and fig. 2b). the spores of bacillus cereus had only a relatively low resistance to formaldehyde. to reduce the proportion of the spores capable of colony formation  to 1/10000, a 2.9% formaldehyde concentration was necessary without heat activation and one of 10.8% with heat activation...

AB  == the infection situation in a four-row cow-house for 153 animals with a frequent occurrence of klebsiella mastitis was subject to a detailed analysis. the following results were obtained after two collections of blood and udder-quarter  milk samples examined by the test-tube agglutination, gel precipitation, and bacteriological diagnosis methods: 1. streptococcus agalactiae was isolated from  milk samples 28 and 31 times, pseudomonas aeruginosa 15 and 19 times, staphylococcus arueus 16 and 19 times, klebsiella pneumoniae 6 and 6 times, acinetobacter calcoaceticus once and 4 times, enterobacter aerogenes twice and three times, and escherichia coli twice. the authors failed to determine the causative agent in 26--38 cows (20--30%) with a pathologically changed secretion. 2. double test-tube agglutination performed in a 30-day interval revealed suspected klebsiella antibodies having a titre of 80 + + and higher in 13 dairy cows (12%); however, the suspicion was disproved by the negative results of gel precipitation. 3. the final deduction concerning the exogenic character of klebsiella mastitis should encourage efforts for good housing, due nutrition, efficacious disinfection, and hygienic milk production.

AB  == in vitro tests for susceptibility to amikacin and to four other aminoglycoside antibiotics were carried out with strains of many bacterial species by use of an  agar dilution method and an inocula replicator. in general, amikacin was as active as or more active against most of the organims than kanamycin, neomycin, and streptomycin; in particular, amikacin was active against strains resistant to one or more of these three antibiotics. amikacin was more active than gentamicin  against strains of nocardia asteroides and providencia stuartii and also against  gentamicin-resistant strains of some other gram-negative bacilli, notably serratia marcescens. however, gentamicin was more active than amikacin against most of the other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria that were tested. in comparative tests of four media, minimal inhibitory concentrations mics) were greater in tests with mueller-hinton agar, and generally somewhat lower in those  with heart infusion agar, than in tests with trypticase soy agar and nutrient agar. inocula of a 1:1,000 dilution of culture generally gave mics lower than those obtained with undiluted cultures; the differences were small with enterococci, but they were greater with amikacin than with gentamicin in tests on strains of klebsiella pneumoniae. these findings generally confirm those previously reported by others.

TI  == ceftezole, a new cephalosporin c derivative i. in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity.
AB  == ceftezole, a new cephalosporin antibiotic similar to cefazolin, has the following chemical structure: (6r,7r)-8-oxo-7[2-(1h-tetrazol-1-yl)acetamido]-3-[(1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-ylthio)meth yl]-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-carboxylic acid. ceftezole was found to be a broad-spectrum antibiotic, active in vitro against many species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria except pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia  marcescens and proteus vulgaris. the activity of ceftezole against clinical isolates of escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. appeared to be nearly equal to that of cefazolin and higher than those of cephaloridine and cephalothin. cross-resistance was observed between ampicillin and cephaloridine, but not between ampicillin and ceftezole, in susceptibility tests on clinical isolates of p. mirabilis. the in vitro activity was little affected by the inoculum size, the presence of human serum or the test medium. ceftezole exhibited apparent bactericidal activity at the concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) against both s. aureus and e. coli. the development in vitro  of resistance by s. aureus 209p and e. coli nihj to ceftezole after 16 transfers  was similar to or somewhat slower than that to other drugs tested. ceftezole was  relatively stable in nutrient broth and minimally degraded in the serum or tissue homogenates of rats. ceftezole, in a single subcutaneous administration, exhibited somewhat less efficacy in mice against intraperitoneal infections with  streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae or p. mirabilis than either cephaloridine or cefazolin. however, ceftezole exhibited efficacy similar to that of cephaloridine or cefazolin when administered in three doses. furthermore, ceftezole was as effective as cefazolin in the treatment of experimental abscesses in mice caused by subcutaneous inoculation with s. aureus.

TI  == factors influencing the immune enhancement of intrapulmonary bactericidal mechanisms.
AB  == the effect of specific immunization on the antibacterial defense mechanisms of the murine lung was assessed against streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus aureus (smith), serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. immunization by aerosol inhalation significantly enhanced the intrapulmonary killing of pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis but not the remaining organisms. with p. mirabilis, systemic immunization induced higher titers of specific serum  agglutinins as compared with local respiratory tract immunization; however, local immunization was more effective in enhancing pulmonary bactericidal activity than was parenteral vaccination. passive immunity against p. mirabilis or aerogenic challenge with preopsonized p. mirabilis significantly enhanced intrapulmonary killing of the homologous organism. with s. aureus, pulmonary bactericidal activity was not accelerated by aerosol challenge with the preopsonized organism, nor was it accelerated in passively immunized mice. these data demonstrate that the immune enhancement of pulmonary bactericidal activity is governed by the bacterium used for challenge and the route of immunization. the results further demonstrate that with p. mirabilis, antibody-mediated mechanisms are involved in  the immune enhancement of pulmonary bactericidal activity.

TI  == laboratory evaluation of 3-(5-tetrazolyl) penam, a new semisynthetic beta-lactam  antibacterial agent with extended broad-spectrum activity.
AB  == in the new agent 3-(5-tetrazolyl)penam, hereafter referred to as cp-35,587, the carboxyl function at c3 in the penicillin nucleus has been replaced with the 5-tetrazolyl moiety. marked changes in spectrum and resistance to gram-negative beta-lactamases, particularly with regard to klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, were conferred by this modification. the anti-klebsiella activity clearly distinguishes the antibacterial spectrum of cp-35,587 from any known broad-spectrum penicillin. compared to orally active cephalosporins, the spectrum advantage of cp-35,587 encompasses enterobacter, serratia marcescens, citrobacter, providencia, haemophilus influenzae, and streptococcus faecalis, both in vitro and in murine infections produced by many of the above-named microorganisms. thus, cp-35,587 combines and extends the antibacterial activity of broad-spectrum penicillins and orally active cephalosporins.

AB  == a microbiological survival chamber for in situ environmental studies involving microorganisms of public health significance was developed. the autoclavable chamber was provided with a supportive base for proper flow orientation and a battery-powered stirring mechanism for continuous internal agitation. the performance of the chamber and its ancillary units was evaluated in estuarine waters by diffusion studies and survival tests with eight species of bacteria isolated from environmental sources. polycarbonate filter membranes were found superior to cellulosic filter membranes. continuous mixing enhanced diffusion and ensured uniform cell suspension. salmonella enteritidis and klebsiella pneumoniae exhibited somewhat greater viability than escherichia coli under similar conditions. of three indicator organisms tested, streptococcus faecalis was the most persistent. in general, the data obtained indicate the usefulness of the chamber in measurements of microbial survival in the natural marine environment.

TI  == effect of capsular polysaccharide of klebsiella pneumoniae on host resistance to  bacterial infections. i. induction of increased susceptibility to infections in mice.
AB  == when klebsiella pneumoniae capsular polysaccharide (cps-k) from type 1, kasuya strain, was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) immediately before i.p. bacterial challenge, the survival time of mice infected with salmonella enteritidis nub 1 (virulent strain) was shortened and the mortality rate for mice infected with s.  enteritidis nub 31 (avirulent strain) was enhanced. the promotion of infection with s. enteritidis nub 1 by cps-k depended upon its dose, the effect of cps-k being demonstrable up to as little as 0.2 mug per mouse. in the case of s. enteritidis nub 31, the effect of cps-k was detectable only when more than 20 mug per mouse was injected. as a result of enumeration of bacterial populations in the peritoneal washing, blood, liver and spleen, it was revealed that cps-k promoted in vivo growth of s. enteritidis nub 1 and nub 31. in addition, cps-k enhanced the mortality rate in mice infected with streptococcus pyogenes or streptococcus pneumoniae. the peak cps-k effect on infection with s. enteritidis  nub 1 was seen when given immediately before bacterial challenge. the active substance responsible for the infection-promoting effect of cps-k was neutral cps-k, which is distinct from the o antigen and from acidic cps-k (the type-specific capsular antigen). preparations of neutral cps-k isolated from the  other three strains of k. pneumoniae exhibited a marked infection-promoting effect comparable with that of preparations from the kasuya strain. neutral cps-k, with identical antigenicity to that from the kasuya strain, has already been found to exert a strong adjuvant effect on antibody responses to various antigens in mice. no parallelism exists between infection-promoting activity and  adjuvant activity of neutral cps-k.

AB  == the effect of a nontoxic, water-soluble adjuvant (neo-wsa) from delipidated cells of mycobacterium smegmatis on the susceptibility of mice to infection with four challenge organisms was studied. an intravenous dose of 1 mg of neo-wsa per mouse 24 hr before challenge enhanced resistance to infection with a fungus (candida albicans), a gram-negative bacterium (klebsiella pneumoniae), and a gram-positive bacterium (streptococcus pneumoniae). protection by neo-wsa was not significant when the mice were challenged with a malarial parasite. plasmodium berghei. when  1 mg of neo-wsa was given intravenously to mice 10 min before challenge with c. albicans, protection was significant, but when the same dose was given two or six days prior to challenge, mice were not protected. the concentration of iron in serum had not changed significantly 1 or 24 hr after the intravenous injection of 1 mg of neo-wsa. thus neo-wsa is capable of inducing nonspecific resistance to certain experimental infections in mice. the protection afforded by administration of neo-wsa 10 min before challenge, the lack of protection afforded by administration of neo-wsa six days before challenge, and the lack of  significant change in the serum iron concentration clearly separate this compound from bacterial endotoxins, which are classical inducers of nonspecific resistance to infection.

TI  == adherence of bacteria to heart valves in vitro.
AB  == the abilities of 14 strains of aerobic gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli to adhere in vitro to human or canine aortic valve leaflets were compared. 2-mm sections of excised valve leaflets were obtained by punch biopsy and were incubated under standardized conditions in suspensions of bacteria. valve sections were subsequently washed and homogenized, and quantitative techniques were used to determine the proportions of bacteria from the initial suspensions that had adhered to the valve sections. comparable results were obtained when these adherence ratios were determined by two independent methods based either on measurements of bacterial viability or of radioactivity in 51cr-labeled bacteria. for each bacterial strain, the adherence ratio was constant over a wide range of concentrations of bacteria in the incubation medium. strains of enterococci, viridans streptococci, coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa (adherence ratios 0.003-0.017) were found to adhere more readily to valve sections than strains of  escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae (adherence ratios 0.00002-0.00004). the organisms that most frequently cause bacterial endocarditis were found to adhere best to heart valves in vitro, suggesting that the ability to adhere to valvular endothelium may be an important or essential charcteristic of bacteria that cause endocarditis in man.

TI  == bacterial meningitis in infancy and childhood in lusaka (one year prospective sturdy).
AB  == in approximately 10,000 admissions in a 12 months period, at university teaching  hospital, lusaka 85 cases of meningitis were recorded. the signs and symptoms in  these patients do not greatly differ from other similar studies in africa. the commonest organism isolated was pneumococcus. there was high mortality rate which was to a large extent due to parents not bringing their children to hospital early enough for medical treatment to be instituted. this is borne out by the fact that 50% of the children with meningitis died within the first 24 hours. the c.s.f. protein and peripheral white blood count may be of prognostic value. spasticity, cranial nerve palsises hydrocephalus and subdural effusion were the commonest complications.

TI  == growth of common bacteria and candida albicans in 10% soybean oil emulsion.
AB  == bacterial and fungal growth in 10% soybean oil emulsion (intralipid) and 5% fibrin hydrolysate in 5% dextrose was studied at 4, 25 and 37 degrees c. staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, str. fecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli and candida albicans were grown in broth at 37 degrees c, diluted in saline and inoculated into each of the two preparations as well as a mixture of the two. growth was measured at 24, 48 and 72 hours. in 10% soybean emulsion, all bacteria except s. pyogenes multiplied, but in fibrin hydrolysate-dextrose solution the only organism of those studied to grow was s. aureus. in the hydrolysate-dextrose-lipid mixture, all organisms multiplied except s. pyogenes and p. aeruginosa. c. albicans grew in all solutions tested. while at 4 degrees c, organisms did not multiply. the fibrin hydrolysate-dextrose solutions given by infusion into a central vein for hyperalimentation have been shown to support predominantly fungal growth, and contamination of the solution and ultimately of the indwelling catheter is a constant hazard. because both bacteria and c. albicans grew equally well in 10% soybean oil emulsion, its use as a caloric source when infused into a central vein may increase the occurrence of sepsis. when this emulsion is used to provide essential fatty acids or calories, it should be given via a peripheral vein, so that a central catheter will not be contaminated.

TI  == abnormal forms of bacteria produced by antibiotics.
AB  == subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics can produce in vitro aberrant forms of bacteria that are similar to those observed in specimens and cultures from patients being treated with antibacterial agents. eight species of bacteria were  grown on membranes placed on agar containing subinhibitory concentrations of nine antibiotics. the resulting organisms were examined by gram stain and electron microscopy. gram stains showed filamentous and granular forms of enterobacteria with bipolar staining, giant staphylococci, and rodlike pneumococci. electron micrographs showed changes in the number and distribution of ribosomes in enterobacteria and septum abnormalities in cocci. such abnormal forms can occasionally simulate the appearance of quite different species, and they may indicate the presence of a subinhibitory antibiotic concentration at the site of  infection as a result of prior antibacterial therapy.

TI  == bacteremia at boston city hospital: occurrence and mortality during 12 selected years (1935-1972), with special reference to hospital-acquired cases.
AB  == the cases of all patients hospitalized at boston city hospital during 1972 who had blood cultures positive for a clinically significant, aerobic bacterial pathogen or for candida were analyzed with respect to incidence and mortality, sex, age, admission to medical or surgical services, and the causative organism.  similar data were obtained for 11 years between 1935 and 1969 selected to reflect the introduction and general use of various effective antibacterial agents. comparisons were also made between hospital-acquired bacteremic infections (defined as those in which the first positive blood culture was obtained on or after the third day in the hospital) and community-acquired infections (defined as those with positive blood cultures on admission or within the first two days in the hospital). in 1972, the incidence of bacteremic infections (but not the case-fatality ratio) was significantly higher in males than in females. bacteremic infections were more than twice as frequent on the medical than on the surgical services, but the case-fatality ratio was slightly but not significantly higher on the surgical services. bacteremia wasteremia was most frequent in the youngest (birth through nine years) and the oldest (greater than or equal to 60 years) age groups, whereas the case-fatality ratio was lowest in the youngest group and increased with each decade of life. streptococcus pneumoniae was the most frequent organism causing bacteremia; next were escherichia coli, klebsiella-enterobacter, and staphylococcus aureus, in that order...

TI  == bacterial studies of clindamycin-associated colitis. a preliminary report.
AB  == the cause of pseudomembraneous colitis is not known but has been attributed to an alteration in the microbial flora of the colon. to test this hypothesis, a blind, prospective study was undertaken in which fecal samples were cultured quantitatively for aerobic and anaerobic organisms. the patients from which these samples were taken were all receiving clindamycin and had diarrhea secondary to the use of the drug. we were able to show definite differences in the colonic microflora which correlated with the presence of pseudomembranes on biopsy. those patients who had diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis showed a striking decrease, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in the number of anaerobes present. those patients who had diarrhea but no pseudomembranes had large numbers of anaerobes which qualitatively approximated normal fecal cultures but quantitatively were fewer in number. a third group of patients, which had resolving pseudomembranous colitis, and were no longer symptomatic, had large numbers of anaerobic organisms which approximated those found in normal fecal cultures. there were no differences among the three groups with regard to facultative anaerobic microflora. thus, the presence of pseudomembranous colitis  correlated directly with a striking quantitative and qualitative decrease in the  anaerobic microflora of the colon. the symptom of diarrhea alone appeared to have no meaning with regard to changes in the bacterial flora. resolution of pseudomembranous colitis was associated with a return of the anaerobic microflora.

TI  == systematic difference in the methylation of ribosomal ribonucleic acid from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == a survey of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was performed to compare the distributionof n6-methylated adenine. it was found that (i) all the gram-positive strains tested, staphylococcus aureus, sarcina lutea, bacillus stearothermophilus, bacillus subtilis, and bacillus megaterium, contain neither n6-monomethyl adenine (m6a) nor n6-dimethyladenine (m26a) in 23s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rrna). in the case of s. aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, strains which are clinically resistant to erythromycin contain m26a. (ii) the gram-negative strains salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae all contain m6a but  not m23a in 23s rrna. these observations suggest the existence of at least one systematic structural difference between the ribosomes of the two classes of bacteria. because of the demonstrated relationship between n6-dimethylation of adenine in 23s rrna and clinical resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b-type antibiotics in staphylococci and streptococci, the observed  systematic differences found in rrna methylation combined with greater cellular permeability may be related to the relatively greater efficacy of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b-type antibiotics in treating infections caused by gram-positive organisms.

TI  == [chemotherapy of purulent meningitis in children (author's transl)].
AB  == purulent meningitis in patients admitted to the pediatric department of kyoto university hospital and affiliated institutions from 1951 through 1973 were studied with emphasis on the kinds of the causative organisms and the susceptibility of these organisms to antibiotics. the findings in this study have served to help select antibiotics most likely to be effective against this disease. the overall incidence of purulent meningitis was 0.68%. this figure decreased little throughout the period. as for the frequency of causative organisms, neisseria meningitidis led the list, and diplococcus pneumoniae ranked just behind. haemophilus influenzae was rare. the frequency of n. meningitidis, however, decreased sharply in spite of the essentially unchanged overall incidence of this disease. the probable reason for the poor prognosis of this disease in spite of the remarkable strides in chemotherapy is the decreased frequency of n. meningitidis and the inversely increased organisms that are resistant to usual chemotherapy. the therapeutic effectiveness of cefazolin against this disease was studied in 15 children including eight newborns and four infants. the daily per kg bodyweight dose was 50 mg or less in four, 50 approximately 100 mg in five, and more than 100 mg in the remaining six. the route of administration was either intramuscular or intravenous. no deaths occurred. the rate of effectiveness was as high as 80%. residual symptoms were recorded in six and, in as many as five of them, the cause was a-tributable to the delayed detection of the disease. neither side effects nor aberrent laboratory findings attributable to large doses of cefazolin were recorded. diffusibility of cefazolin into the csf was studied in nine subjects. the csf concentration of this antibiotic was shown to be somewhat lower than that of ampicillin or cephaloridine and to account on an average for 13% of the mean peak serum level. this relatively low diffusibility will be offset by its high serum concentration and safe large-dose therapy. these findings have clearly shown that the therapeutic effectiveness of cefazolin is as high as that of ampicillin, and  that this excellent effectiveness holds true even when the causative organism happens to be escherichia coli, klebsiella, etc. that are resistant to ampicillin. the authors have furthermore scrutinized much literature on the frequency of the causative organisms, emergence of resistant strains, and the diffusibility of antibiotics into the csf, and arrived at the conclusion that cefazolin is a promising antibiotic of choice for the treatment of purulent meningitis in newborn. the daily dose is preferably 150 mg/kg or more given in three divided intravenous doses. meanwhile ampicillin proved to be useful as the  antibiotic of choice for the treatment of purulent meningitis in infants and children.

AB  == contamination of werum by certain gram-negative bacteria has been shown to spoil  the serum for measurement of trypsin inhibitory capacity (stic) or for antitrypsin phenotyping. such sera develop intense fibrinolytic activity when the stic has dropped to itsminimal level, but antitrypsin concentration as measured by radial immunodiffusion remainsconstant. cultures of enterobacter, klebsiella,  bacillus subtilis, and pseudomonas species were shown to have this capability, but production of the fibrinolytic enzyme by the bacteria was most proficient in  the presence of human serum. the enzyme is believed to be of bacterial origin because of its lack of esterase activity, and because activation of serum plasmin by streptokinase did not affect the stic. care mustbe taken to avoid bacterial contamination of blood that is to be submitted for an sticassay and/or antitrypsin phenotyping. serum should be prepared quickly, frozen soon,and stored and transported in a frozen state.

TI  == microflora of maize prepared as tortillas.
AB  == very little is known of the microflora in tortillas, the major component in the diet of many guatemalans and other central americans. based in a guatemalan highland indian village, this study examined the types and amounts of bacteria, yeasts, and molds in tortillas and in their maize precursors. coliforms, bacillus cereus, two species of staphylococcus, and many types of yeast were the main contaminants, but low concentrations of alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, facultative clostridium, and other bacterial types were also found. when tortillas were first cooked, the bacterial counts dropped to 1,000 or fewer organisms per g, a safe level for consumption. under village conditions, bacterial counts regained precooking levels (about 10(8) organisms/g) within 24 h and rose even higher after 48 h. reheating caused very little change; hence, bacterial levels remained very high in old tortillas kept for later consumption.  a search for the sources of contamination showed that most came from water used in preparation and from the soiled hands of women preparing the tortillas. as an  attempt to correct certain nutritional needs of the population, the institute of  nutrition for central america and panama initiated a tortilla fortification project in the guatemalan village. the bacterial counts in fortified tortillas did not differ significantly from those in oridinary tortillas. furthermore, the  level of contamination was constant among tortillas of different sizes and among  tortillas made from different types of maize.

AB  == the antibacterial activities of 4 cephalosporin antibiotics, cefazolin, cephaloridine, cephalothin and cephalexin, against 330 isolates of bacteria from  patients at national taiwan university hospital, were determined by an agar plate dilution technique. cephalosporins possess strong antibacterial activity against  gram-positive bacteria except enterococci. staphylococcus aureus is the most susceptible among the organisms tested. more than 90% of staphylococcus aureus strains are suppressed by cefazolin, cephaloridine and cephalothin at the concentrations of 3.13 mug/ml or less, except that 49.1% are suppressed by cephalexin. the relative potency of cephalosporins against staphylococcus aureus  in decreasing order is cephaloridine, cephalothin, cefazolin, and cephalexin. the gram-negative bacilli, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis are less susceptible to cephalosporins than the gram-positive cocci. among the cephalosporins, cefazolin is the most active against the gram-negative  pathogens tested. the relative potency of antibacterial activity of cephalosporins against e. coli in decreasing order is cefazolin, cephaloridine, cephalexin, and cephalothin. one hour after the intramuscular injection of 500 mg of cefazolin, the maximum concentration of 33.3 mug/ml is reached in the serum. the sufficient high levels are sustained for 8 hours. very high concentrations of cefazolin are also found in the urine.

TI  == in vitro activity of sisomicin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, against clinical isolates.
AB  == sisomicin, a new aminoglycoside antibiotic which is produced by micromonospora myoensis, was studied against 565 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli and  gram-positive cocci. with the exception of serratia marcescens, over 90% of isolates of gram-negative bacilli were inhibited by 1.56 mug/ml or less of sisomicin. sisomicin was slightly more active than gentamicin and tobramycin aganist isolates of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella spp. it was substantially more active than butirosin and kanamycin against all gram-negative bacilli. isolates of gram-negative bacilli which were resistant to  gentamicin and tobramycin were also resistant to sisomicin. most of these isolates were sensitive to amikacin.

AB  == effects of a new antimicrobial agent sisomicin on microorganisms isolated from pathologic material (pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella spp., streptococcus pyogenes-b, citrobacter freundii) were studied. the results obtained were compared with another two aminoglycoside antibiotics - gentamicin and tobramycin. all three antibiotics were found to be very effective in vitro; their effect was enhanced by addition of an antibiotic of the penicillin group (carbenicillin, suncillin) or an antibiotic of the tetracyklin series (oxytetracyklin, doxycyklin). all three preparations were tested on 26 mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. tobramycin inhibited growth of 22 strains and thus presented the highest level of efficiency among these deoxystreptamin preparations.

TI  == [postoperative bacterial endocarditis after cardiac prosthesis (author's transl)].
AB  == the infection of an endocardial prosthesis, either valvular or septal patch, is a frequent and dangerous post-operative complication. eleven patients having postoperative endocarditis (9 on valve prosthesis and 2 on ventricular septal patch) are the subject of this paper. six of the 7 infected "early" had gram-negative bacteria in the blood cultures, while staphylococus aureus, streptococcus viridans and klebsiella pneumoniae were responsible for 3 of the 4  "late" infections. in 2 patients, one "early" and one "late" the causative bacteria were not identified. the definite prevalence of gram-negative flora in post-operative endocarditis may have been facilitated by the routine use of antibiotics after open-heart surgery. three of the 11 patients survived, one after replacement of the infected prosthesis and two after prolonged specific antibiotic treatment. on the basic of this experience, compared with other written reports, the authors propose to treat postoperative endocarditis medically for approximately 5 weeks, with full doses of specific antibiotics, reserving for surgical treatment only the cases of prosthetic malfunction, left atrial thrombosis, peripheral embolization and in those patients where the medical treatment fails.

AB  == a comparative study of 9 media for testing the susceptibility of bacteria to 7 sulphonamides has been carried out. the evaluated culture-media included 4 "mueller hinton" media (mh), 4 others based on the formula of the "diagnostic sensitivity test" agar base (d.s.t.) and a "synthetic medium" (sm) which has been developed in our laboratory. mh and d.s.t. culture-media have been supplied by 4  manufacturing companies in europe and usa. a total number of 21 bacterial cultures have been employed. the included species belong to the gram negative genera citrobacter, escherichia, klebsiella, proteus, salmonella, serratia and shigella, and to the gram positive genus streptococcus. sulphafurazole, sulphasomidine, sulphamethoxazole, sulphamethoxypyridazine, sulphadimethoxine, sulphaphenazole and sulphamethoxydiazine have been investigated. sm proved to be  clearly superior to the other 8 culture-media mentioned above. just one mh afforded good results. the 3 other mh and 2 d.s.t. media were not quite satisfactory. the two remaining d.s.t. media were unsuitable. moreover, the activity of the tested sulphonamides was not equally high against the concerned bacteria. the author discussed the significance of the inoculum-size and of competitive and noncompetitive sulphonamide-antagonists in commercial culture-media and the difficulties they raise by the interpretation of the results.

AB  == cefazolin sodium, a cephalosporin for parenteral use, was evaluated in vitro and  in 26 patients. cefazolin had activity equivalent to cephalothin against streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, group a streptococci, and proteus mirabilis. cefazolin was four- to eightfold more active against escherichia coli and slightly more active against klebsiella pneumoniae, whereas  cephalothin was slightly more active against indole-positive proteus species. after a 500-mg dose of cefazolin intramuscularly, peak concentrations in the serum were high enough to inhibit all strains of s. pneumoniae, s. aureus, group  a streptococci, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis, as well as 60% of strains of proteus species other than p. mirabilis. all of 26 patients (18 with pneumonia, 6 with urinary tract infection, and 2 with skin infections) responded  clinically and bacteriologically to cefazolin therapy. there were no major side effects of therapy, and no patient complained of pain at the site of intramuscular injection. cefazolin is an effective cephalosporin which can be used intramuscularly for therapy of serious bacterial infections. its major advantages over other cephalosporins are higher, more sustained concentrations in the blood and apparent lack of pain on intramuscular injection.

AB  == bl-s 339 is a new broad-spectrum, parenterally effective cephalosporin whose expression of antibacterial activity in vitro is markedly affected by the nature  of the assay medium. when assayed in nutrient agar, bl-s 339 was more active than cephalothin against strains of diplococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter, and indole-positive proteus sp. however, when assayed in mueller-hinton medium, its activity, especially against gram-negative bacteria, was reduced substantially, whereas the activity of cephalothin was virtually unaffected by the assay medium. the in vivo activity of bl-s 339 correlated well with its activity in nutrient agar; when administered subcutaneously to mice, it was therapeutically more efficacious than cephalothin in infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. when bl-s 339 was administered intramuscularly to mice, the concentrations achieved in the blood were three times those achieved with cephalothin. bl-s 339 was bound to human serum proteins to the same extent as cephalothin. recovery of bl-s 339 in the urine within the 24-hr period after intramuscular administration to rats was three times that of cephalothin.

TI  == activity of methacycline, related tetracyclines, and other antibiotics against various l-forms and their parent bacteria in vitro.
AB  == the activity of methacycline against microbial l-forms and their parent bacteria  was compared with that of oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, tetracycline, and demethylchlortetracycline, as well as with that of 22 other antibiotics which included examples of major groups of antibiotics. the l-forms and bacteria used were streptococcus faecalis, s. faecium, s. faecalis var. zymogenes, staphylococcus aureus (three strains), proteus mirabilis (two strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli (two strains), sarcina flava, serratia marcescens, and klebsiella pneumoniae. the five tetracyclines had similar activities and were more active against l-forms than bacterial forms, except that the bacterial form of s. flava was more susceptible than the l-form. in general,  other antibiotics (except the penicillins) were more active against l-forms than  bacterial forms. there were certain exceptions where the bacterial form was more  susceptible than the l-form. these included the effect of polymyxin b and colistin on p. aeruginosa, e. coli, and p. mirabilis, and the effect of gentamicin on p. aeruginosa, e. coli, s. flava, and s. marcescens.

TI  == butirosin, a new aminoglycosidic antibiotic complex: antibacterial activity in vitro and in mice.
AB  == butirosin is a new aminoglycosidic antibiotic complex which has broad gram-negative and gram-positive inhibitory antibacterial activity, as well as some bactericidal properties. significantly susceptible bacteria include strains  of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, and pathogenic gram-negative species such as enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae,  proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris, salmonella enteritidis and s. typhimurium, shigella flexneri and s. sonnei. good activity by parenteral dosing was obtained  in various acute mouse infections. butirosin is especially interesting because of its activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro, including gentamicin-resistant clinical isolates, and in experimental mouse infections at relatively low doses.

TI  == amoxycillin: a new semi-synthetic penicillin.
AB  == amoxycillin (alpha-amino-p-hydroxybenzylpenicillin) is a new semi-synthetic penicillin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity similar to that of ampicillin. penicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococci, streptococci, and pneumococci were sensitive to concentrations of 0.1 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. strains of haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by a level of 0.5 mug/ml, and most strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, shigella sonnei, salmonella species, and streptococcus faecalis were sensitive to a concentration of 5 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. penicillinase-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus and strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, indole-positive proteus, klebsiella, and enterobacter were insensitive to amoxycillin. the new penicillin was bactericidal in activity, as with other penicillins, and its antibacterial activity was not reduced in the presence of serum. after oral administration to volunteer subjects amoxycillin produced serum concentrations twice as high as those obtained with similar doses of ampicillin, and the penicillin was recovered unchanged in high concentrations in the urine. the absorption of amoxycillin was not greatly influenced by food, and administration  of probenecid resulted in increased and more prolonged concentrations of amoxycillin in serum.

AB  == 7-[alpha-(1-methyl-4-pyridiniothio)-acetamido] cephalosporanic acid, referred to  herein as bl-s 217, is a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic cephalosporin that offers several advantages over cephalothin. a comparison of the activity in vitro of these antibiotics indicates that bl-s 217 is about eightfold more effective against streptococcus pyogenes and diplococcus pneumoniae. against gram-negative  bacteria, bl-s 217 possesses a broader antibacterial spectrum than cephalothin, particularly against members of the enterobacteriaceae family; e.g., bl-s 217 inhibited over 20% more strains of both escherichia coli and klebsiella than cephalothin and also showed some advantage in tests against salmonella and enterobacter. overall, of 208 strains of enterobacteriaceae tested, 172 were susceptible to bl-s 217 compared to 149 for cephalothin. bl-s 217 was less bound  to human serum proteins than cephalothin and gave higher peak blood levels in mice after intramuscular administration. the ld(50) of bl-s 217 in mice after subcutaneous administration was in excess of 4,000 mg/kg. when administered by the same route to mice experimentally infected with cephalothin-sensitive bacterial strains, this new cephalosporin was 20 times more effective than cephalothin in s. pyogenes and d. pneumoniae infections and 3 to 4 times more efficacious in an e. coli infection. its therapeutic efficacy was comparable to that of cephalothin in infections produced by strains of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis.

TI  == serum bacteriostasis of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == serum bacteriostasis of staphylococcus aureus was characterized quantitatively and quantitatively. bacteriostasis was proportional to the concentration of serum. reproducibility was good; freezing and thawing did not materially affect the end point. four of six different strains, including the propagating s. aureus strain for phage 73 which does not produce coagulase, were susceptible to serum bacteriostasis in similar titers; two were not susceptible at all. all six strains were effective inhibitors of bacteriostasis. active and inactive coagulase were also inhibitors. in contrast to sensitive s. aureus, s. epidermidis and streptococcus salivarius were not uniformly susceptible to bacteriostasis by different serums. escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella montevideo, s. zymogenes, and diplococcus pneumoniae were not susceptible. among gram-positive bacteria, only d. pneumoniae inhibited s. aureus bacteriostasis. agglutinins of s. aureus and nonspecific substances such as lysozyme, beta-lysin, c-reactive protein, and transferrin were not responsible for s. aureus serum bacteriostasis. after diethylaminoethyl column fractionation of serum, the bacteriostatic principle was eluted in proximity to blood group antibody; immunoglobulins a, g, and m appeared to be present in bacteriostatic fractions. it is suggested that s. aureus bacteriostasis by serum is due to natural antibody and that inhibitory reactions  with pneumococci and coagulase are due to common antigens.

TI  == vitamin b12 uptake by intestinal microorganisms: mechanism and relevance to syndromes of intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
AB  == the mechanism of bacterial uptake of vitamin b(12), the spectrum of microorganisms capable of such uptake, and the factors involved were the subject  of this study. bacterial uptake of vitamin b(12) was found to be at least a two stage process. a primary uptake phase which was rapid (1 min or less), ph dependent, nontemperature dependent, did not require viable organisms and was insensitive to either the metabolic inhibitor dinitrophenol or to the sulfhydryl  inhibitor n-ethyl-maleimide. protein denaturation (formalin treatment or autoclaving) abolished all b(12) uptake. this primary uptake phase is thought to  represent adsorption to binding or "receptor" sites on the cell wall. second stage uptake was slower, ph and temperature dependent, required living bacteria,  and was abolished by either dinitrophenol or n-ethyl-maleimide. this phase is dependent upon metabolic processes and may reflect transfer of b(12) from surface "receptor" sites into the bacterial cell. although differences among organisms were observed in total 1 hr uptake, number of surface "receptor" sites, and relative avidities for b(12), all organisms except streptococcus fecalis shared the two stage mechanism. two gram-positive organisms. bacillus subtilis and group a streptococcus, demonstrated the highest 1 hr vitamin b(12) uptake values; gram-negative bacteria required 2,000-10,000 the number of organisms for comparable uptake. binding constants (k(m)) varied from 5.05 +/-1.67 x 10(-10)m for b. subtilis to 6.18 +/-3.08 x 10(-9)m for klebsiella pneumoniae which approximate the km for human intrinsic factor (0.38 x 10(-10)m). competition between bacteria and intrinsic factor for vitamin b(12) may be inferred from the  similarity of these constants. these observations suggest that a variety of enteric and nonenteric organisms, not requiring exogenous b(12), may play a role  in the pathogenesis of the vitamin b(12) malabsorption found in the intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndromes.

AB  == the in vitro activity of coumermycin a(1) was compared with that of novobiocin, ampicillin, and minocycline. coumermycin was found to be the most active antibiotic of the four against staphylococcus aureus. it was about 50 times more  active than novobiocin or minocycline against the strains tested. coumermycin also showed good activity against group a streptococci and pneumococci, moderate  activity against escherichia coli, indole-positive proteus species, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and poor activity against klebsiella-enterobacter and enterococci. against p. mirabilis, however, coumermycin activity was almost equal to that of ampicillin. the new antibiotic was further found to be greatly reduced in activity in the presence of plasma, but its minimal inhibitory concentration was not greatly affected by inoculum size. coumermycin was found to be bacteriostatic in its action, and resistance to it developed slowly. also, cross-resistance was present with novobiocin but absent with ampicillin or minocycline.

TI  == quantitation of microorganisms in sputum.
AB  == a method of quantitating microbial cultures of homogenized sputum has been devised. possible application of this method to the problem of determining the etiologic agent of lower-respiratory-tract infections has been studied to determine its usefulness as a guide in the management of these infections. specimens were liquefied by using an equal volume of 2% n-acetyl-l-cysteine. the  liquefied sputum suspension was serially diluted to 10(-1), 10(-3), 10(-5), and 10(-7). these dilutions were plated on appropriate media by using an 0.01-ml calibrated loop; they were incubated and examined by standard diagnostic methods. quantitation of fresh sputum from patients with pneumonia prior to antimicrobial  therapy revealed that probable pathogens were present in populations of 10(7) organisms/ml or greater. normal oropharyngeal flora did not occur in these numbers before therapy. comparison of microbial counts on fresh and aged sputum showed that it is necessary to use only fresh specimens, since multiplication or  death alters both quantitative and qualitative findings. proper collection and quantitative culturing of homogenized sputum provided information more directly applicable to patient management than did qualitative routine methods. not only was the recognition of the probable pathogenic organism in pneumonia patients improved, but serial quantitative cultures were particularly useful in recognizing the emergence of superinfections and in evaluating the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == antipseudomonal activity of alpha-sulfoaminopenicillins.
AB  == a series of penicillins characterized by the presence of a sulfoamino or a modified sulfoamino group in the side chain was subjected to in vitro antimicrobial screening tests. although the most potent members of the series were less active than benzylpenicillin against gram-positive bacteria and comparably active against most gram-negative bacteria, they were, on the average, 8 to 16 times more effective against strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. in other  comparative laboratory tests against p. aeruginosa, these compounds were about as active as carbenicillin and four to eight times more active than ampicillin. an examination of structure-activity relationships indicated that maximal potency was obtained with penicillins having an alpha-(aromatic or heteroaromatic)-alpha-sulfoaminoacetamido side chain. the compound with an alpha-phenyl group was comparable in activity to those having an alpha-(2- or 3-thienyl) group, whereas any modification in position or structure of the alpha-sulfoamino group reduced activity. results of studies with a cell-free p. aeruginosa beta-lactamase suggest that the marked inhibitory effects of alpha-sulfoamino penicillins for p. aeruginosa can be attributed, at least in part, to their high degree of resistance to this enzyme. some derivatives, however, had weak antipseudomonal activity, despite possessing a high degree of beta-lactamase resistance.

AB  == concentrations of cephalexin (an orally absorbed derivative of cephalosporin c) in serum and urine were determined in normal volunteers and patients. the in vitro antibacterial activity was also studied. all strains of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci and diplococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 3.1 mug/ml. of the staphylococcus aureus strains, 88% were inhibited by 6.3 mug/ml, and 12.5 mug/ml was inhibitory for all s. aureus, 80% of escherichia coli, 72% of klebsiella-aerobacter, and 56% of proteus mirabilis strains. about 90 to 96% of e. coli, klebsiella aerobacter, and p. mirabilis strains were inhibited by 25 mug of cephalexin per ml. pseudomonas and indole-positive proteus strains proved to be quite resistant to cephalexin. cephalexin was well absorbed after oral administration. a peak serum concentration of cephalexin of at least 5 mug/ml was achieved in each volunteer with 250 and 500-mg doses. a mean peak serum concentration of 7.7 mug/ml was achieved with 250-mg doses; 12.3mug/ml was achieved with 500-mg doses of antibiotic. food did not interfere with absorption. probenecid enhanced both the peak serum concentration and the duration of antibiotic activity in the serum. over 90% of the administered dose was excreted  in the urine within 6 hr. the mean peak serum concentration of cephalexin after an oral dose of 500 mg was adequate to inhibit all group a streptococci, d. pneumoniae, and s. aureus, 85% of e. coli, and about 40 to 75% of klebsiella-aerobacter and p. mirabilis strains. levels of cephalexin in urine were adequate to inhibit over 90% of e. coli, and p. mirabilis and 80 to 96% of klebsiella-aerobacter strains.

AB  == a large number of recently isolated bacterial pathogens were tested for susceptibility to cephalexin and cephaloglycin by the replica inoculating method. strains of group a hemolytic streptococci, viridans (alpha and gamma) streptococci, pneumococci, gonococci, meningococci, and penicillin g-sensitive staphylococcus aureus were all moderately to highly susceptible to both of these  cephalosporin analogues, nearly all of the strains being two to eight (median four) times more susceptible to cephaloglycin than to cephalexin. the penicillin  g-resistant, penicillinase-producing strains of s. aureus varied in their susceptibility; many were moderately resistant to both analogues, particularly to cephalexin. strains of enterococci, haemophilus influenzae, and most of the common gram-negative bacilli were moderately to highly resistant. reducing the size of the inoculum had variable effects on inhibition by these drugs, depending on the species or strain. the activity of cephalexin was very little affected by  ph of the medium within the clinical range or by incubation at 37 c in broth for  up to 24 hr. in contrast, cephaloglycin in broth deteriorated rapidly at 37 c, and its activity was markedly reduced in alkaline medium. both cephalexin and cephaloglycin were rapidly absorbed and excreted into the urine after single oral doses of 500 mg. much higher levels were achieved and sustained with the former.  absorption of both analogues was delayed when taken with food, and the levels in  the serum were significantly higher and better sustained when probenecid was also given. very high concentrations of cephalexin were excreted into the urine during the first 4 hr, and the levels were still high in the 4- to 8-hr collection. the  concentrations of cephaloglycin in the urine at these times were much lower. an average of 80 to 93% of the dose of cephalexin and 25 to 30% of the cephaloglycin were accounted for as active drug in the urine collected in 8 hr. both analogues  were well tolerated.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of erythromycin was markedly enhanced by alkalinization of the culture medium or urine within the clinical range (ph 6.0 to 8.2). this effect was demonstrated against recent isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis. the urine of normal volunteers was made alkaline by ingestion of sodium bicarbonate or acetazolamide (diamox) during administration of 1.0 g of erythromycin every 8 hr; such urine was capable of inhibiting e. coli and k. pneumoniae even when diluted  up to (in one instance) 128 times with broth of the same ph as the urine. undiluted urine of the same subjects, without alkalinization, was seldom capable  of inhibiting these organisms. the range of ph (6.6 to 8.6) over which the antibacterial effect was enhanced coincided with that over which there was decreasing ionization of a basic group.

TI  == effects of indomethacin on acute, subacute, and latent infections in mice and rats.
AB  == the comparative effect of indomethacin and hydrocortisone on the resistance of mice or rats to various acute, subacute, and latent bacterial infections was investigated. large daily doses of indomethacin and hydrocortisone administered to mice challenged with bacterial pathogens, including klebsiella pneumoniae ad,  salmonella schottmuelleri 3010, staphylococcus aureus (smith), streptococcus pyogenes c203, salmonella pullorum #2, proteus vulgaris 1810, and pseudomonas aeruginosa 2616, revealed that in essentially all of these acute infections, the  mortality of the infected mice treated with indomethacin was essentially identical to that found in the infected controls. in contrast, hydrocortisone often lowered the resistance of mice to these acute infections. in a more chronic bacterial infection due to corynebacterium kutscheri, hydrocortisone produced striking deleterious effects on resistance, whereas indomethacin administration in doses approaching the maximal tolerated level caused no observable adverse effects on host resistance. indomethacin fed continuously to rats for 80 days, at maximal tolerated levels, caused no observable adverse effects on the host-parasite relationship of rats which were shown to harbor various latent infections. hydrocortisone administration, however, lowered the resistance of rats as evidenced by increased mortality related directly to extensive bacterial  infection. insofar as infection is concerned, indomethacin behaved like other nonsteroid anti-inflammatory agents such as aspirin and phenylbutazone.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity and human pharmacology of cephaloglycin.
AB  == serum and urine concentrations of cephaloglycin (an orally absorbed derivative of cephalosporin c) were determined in normal volunteers and in patients. the in vitro activity of cephaloglycin was also studied. all strains of group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes) and diplococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.4 mug of cephaloglycin per ml. eighty per cent of the staphylococcus aureus  strains and about 50% of the escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis strains were  inhibited by 1.6 mug of cephaloglycin per ml. klebsiella-aerobacter species were  more resistant to cephaloglycin and 12.5 mug per ml was required to inhibit 70% of these strains. when single doses of 250, 500, or 1,000 mg of cephaloglycin were administered to fasting volunteers, a peak serum concentration of at least 0.5 mug per ml was achieved. a full breakfast did not interfere with absorption of cephaloglycin. probenecid enhanced both the peak serum concentration and the duration of antibiotic activity in the serum. serum concentrations of cephaloglycin were even higher in patients who were receiving repeated doses. the peak serum concentrations of cephaloglycin in all volunteers and patients were adequate to inhibit all strains of group a streptococci and d. pneumoniae. many of the peak serum concentrations were adequate to inhibit some strains of s. aureus, e. coli, and p. mirabilis. urine levels of cephaloglycin were high enough in all volunteers and patients to inhibit more than 90% of the e. coli and p. mirabilis strains and over 70% of the strains of klebsiella-aerobacter.

TI  == in vivo and in vitro action of norethindrone on staphylococci.
AB  == norethindrone has been examined in vitro for antibacterial activity against 10 microorganisms. turbidimetric techniques were used to assay the antibacterial activity of norethindrone. the organisms tested included staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococcus conglomeratus, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus  faecalis, salmonella typhosa, shigella flexnerii, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and proteus vulgaris. bacteriostatic action was shown only against the gram-positive microorganisms when they were grown anaerobically in tryptic soy broth containing 10 to 50 mug of norethindrone per ml. the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone was exerted primarily during the first 8 hr of incubation and it was reduced by the presence of oxygen. mestranol at a concentration of 1 to 10 mug/ml failed to exert any significant action on s. aureus. however, incorporation of 5 mug of mestranol per ml in the culture medium enhanced the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone on staphylococci. enhancement of the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone could not be obtained by the addition of a concentration of 5 mug/ml of testosterone, 17alpha-estradiol, and 17beta-estradiol. progesterone and 4-pregnen-20beta-ol-3-one under similar conditions showed an additive bacteriostatic effect when they were incorporated into the culture medium containing norethindrone. in vivo studies indicated that  female, adult new zealand rabbits, injected subcutaneously with two injections of 10 to 20 mug of norethindrone, 24 hr apart, and challenged intradermally with s.  aureus 4 hr after the second injection, had fewer lesions with smaller areas of swelling and erythema as compared to control, nontreated rabbits. the protective  effect of norethindrone on the development of staphylococcal lesion seemed related to hormone concentration. thus, it was demonstrated with doses of 20, 15, and 10 mug, but not with doses of 1 and 5 mug. when the lesions were excised 48 to 92 hr after infection and when viable cell counts were made, rabbits treated with norethindrone showed significantly lower staphylococcal counts than the control rabbits. during the 1st day after infection with s. aureus, leukocytic counts of the norethindrone-treated rabbits remained normal, whereas control animals showed elevated leukocytic counts.

(veterans administration hsopital, st. louis, mo.). resistance-enhancing activity of culture filtrates of mycobacterium tuberculosis. j. bacteriol. 88:1349-1355. 1964.-it was demonstrated that filtrates of cultures  of mycobacterium tuberculosis exhibit resistance-enhancing activity against infection with klebsiella pneumoniae and diplococcus pneumoniae. resistance was demonstrable when the culture filtrate was injected 3 hr prior to challenge with  k. pneumoniae, and reached the highest level when injected 24 hr before challenge. protection was maximal when the filtrate and challenging organisms were injected by the same route. after infection with k. pneumoniae, the bacterial titers in the tissues of filtrate-treated animals were significantly lower than those of untreated susceptible controls. mice injected with the filtrate 24 hr previously demonstrated significantly increased rates of clearance of injected carbon from the blood. in examination of a variety of mycobacteria, resistance-enhancing activity was found only in culture-filtrates of pathogenic mycobacteria, the highest concentration occurring in filtrates of virulent organisms. the injection of a relatively large amount of phenol-killed cells of all of the mycobacteria examined enhanced resistance to infection with k. pneumoniae.
