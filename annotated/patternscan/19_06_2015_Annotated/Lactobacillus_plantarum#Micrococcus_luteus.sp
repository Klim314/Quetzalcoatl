TI  == identification and antimicrobial activity detection of lactic acid bacteria isolated from corn stover silage.
AB  == a total of 59 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains were isolated from corn stover silage. according to phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) sequences and reca gene polymerase chain reaction amplification, these lab isolates were identified as five species: lactobacillus (l.) plantarum subsp. plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, enterococcus mundtii, weissella cibaria and leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, respectively. those strains were also screened for antimicrobial activity using a dual-culture agar plate assay. based on excluding the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide, two l. plantarum subsp. plantarum strains zzu 203 and 204, which strongly inhibited salmonella enterica atcc 43971(t), micrococcus luteus atcc 4698(t) and escherichia coli atcc 11775(t) were selected for further research on sensitivity of the antimicrobial substance to heat, ph and protease. cell-free culture supernatants of the two strains exhibited strong heat stability (60 min at 100 degrees c), but the antimicrobial activity was eliminated after treatment at 121 degrees c for 15 min. the antimicrobial substance remained active under acidic condition (ph 2.0 to 6.0), but became inactive under neutral and alkaline condition (ph 7.0 to 9.0). in addition, the antimicrobial activities of these two strains decreased remarkably after digestion by protease k. these results preliminarily suggest that the desirable antimicrobial activity of strains zzu 203 and 204 is the result of the production of a bacteriocin-like substance, and these two strains with antimicrobial activity could be used as silage additives to inhibit proliferation of unwanted microorganism during ensiling and preserve nutrients of silage. the nature of the antimicrobial substances is being investigated in our laboratory.

TI  == microencapsulation, chemical characterization, and antimicrobial activity of mexican (lippia graveolens h.b.k.) and european (origanum vulgare l.) oregano essential oils.
AB  == the effect of solvent polarity (methanol and pentane) on the chemical composition of hydrodistilled essential oils (eo's) of lippia graveolens h.b.k. (mxo) and origanum vulgare l. (euo) was studied by gc-ms. composition of modified starch microencapsulated eo's was conducted by headspace-solid-phase microextraction (hs-spme). the antimicrobial activity of free and microencapsulated eo's was evaluated. they were tested against salmonella sp., brochothrix thermosphacta, pseudomonas fragi, lactobacillus plantarum, and micrococcus luteus. thymol and carvacrol were among the main components of eo's and their free and microencapsulated inhibitory activity was tested against m. luteus, showing an additive combined effect. chemical composition of eo's varied according to the solvent used for gc analysis and to volatile fraction as evaluated by hs-spme. thymol (both solvents) was the main component in essential oil of mxo, while carvacrol was the main component of the volatile fraction. euo showed alpha-pinene (methanol) and gamma-terpinene (pentane) as major constituents, the  latter being the main component of the volatile fraction. eo's showed good stability after 3 months storage at 4 degrees c, where antimicrobial activity of  microencapsulated eo's remained the same, while free eo's decreased 41% (mxo) and 67% (euo) from initial activity. microencapsulation retains most antimicrobial activity and improves stability of eo's from oregano.

TI  == plantaricin ld1: a bacteriocin produced by food isolate of lactobacillus plantarum ld1.
AB  == plantaricin ld1, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum ld1, was characterized for biochemical and antimicrobial properties. bacteriocin showed stability at high temperatures (100 degrees c for 20 min and 121 degrees c for 15 min under 15 psi pressure), in a ph range of 2.0-8.0 and also in the presence of  organic solvents, surfactants and detergents. the crude preparation was not affected by catalase, amylase and lipase but activity was reduced in the presence of pepsin, trypsin and proteinase k showing proteinaceous nature of the compound. the molecular weight of bacteriocin was found to be approximately 6.5 kda, and antimicrobial activity was confirmed by bioassay. it inhibited not only related strains but also other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria such as lactobacillus curvatus nrrl b-4562, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis nrrl b-1821, enterococcus faecium nrrl b-2354, enterobacter cloacae nrrl b-14298, micrococcus  luteus, staphylococcus aureus, urogenic escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri and vibrio sp. these properties of plantaricin ld1 suggest its applications not only in food safety but in therapeutics as well.

TI  == cloning and heterologous expression of plne, -f, -j and -k genes derived from soil metagenome and purification of active plantaricin peptides.
AB  == plantaricin gene-specific primers were used to obtain plne, -f, -j and -k structural gene amplicons from soil metagenome. these amplicons were cloned and expressed in pet32a (+) vector in escherichia coli bl21 (de3). plne, -f, -j and -k peptides were expressed as his-tagged-fusion proteins and were separated by ni(2+) -chelating affinity chromatography. the peptides were released from the fusion by enterokinase cleavage and separated from the carrier thioredoxin. the cleaved peptides were further analysed for antimicrobial activity and found to be active against listeria innocua nrrl b33314, micrococcus luteus mtcc 106 and lactic acid bacteria, such as enterococcus casseliflavus nrrl b3502, lactococcus  lactis lactis nrrl 1821, lactobacillus curvatus nrrl b4562 and lactobacillus plantarum nrrl b4496. e. coli has been successfully exploited as a host for heterologous expression with a significant yield of fused and cleaved peptides in the range of 8-12 and 1-1.5 mg/l of the culture, respectively. heterologous expression, therefore, can be used to overcome the constraints of low yield often reported from a native strain.

TI  == development of bacteria identification array to detect lactobacilli in thai fermented sausage.
AB  == to improve the quality and safety of food products, there is a need in the food industry for a reliable method for simultaneously monitoring multiple bacterial strains. microarray technology is a high-throughput screening approach that can provide an alternative for bacteria detection. a total of 164 bacteria-specific probes were designed from 16s rrna gene sequences to target 12 bacteria species,  including lactic acid bacteria and selected food pathogens. after fabrication onto aminosilane-coated slides, hybridization conditions of the array were optimized for high specificity and signal intensities. the array was applied to detect 12 bacteria individually and was specific to all (lactobacillus plantarum  group, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. delbrueckii, l. casei, l. sakei, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus and listeria monocytogenes) except l. animalis. multiplex detection using mixed bacteria populations was evaluated and accurate detection was obtained. the feasibility of using the array to detect the target bacteria in food was evaluated with thai fermented sausages  (nham). meat samples were collected on days 2, 3 and 7 after natural fermentation, l. plantarum-inoculated fermentation and l. brevis-inoculated fermentation before applying to the array. the naturally-fermented nham contained l. sakei, l. delbrueckii, l. plantarum and l. fermentum. the l. plantarum-inoculated nham showed a similar lactic acid bacteria population but the positive signal level for l. plantarum was higher than with natural fermentation. the l. brevis-inoculated nham contained l. brevis, l. plantarum, l. delbrueckii and l. fermentum. the array was used to monitor bacteria population dynamics during the fermentation process. the naturally-fermented and l. brevis-inoculated samples showed lower positive signal levels of l. plantarum on  day 2, but signals gradually increased on days 3 and 7 of the fermentation. in contrast, the l. plantarum-started fermentation showed a higher positive signal level on day 2 than the natural and l. brevis-inoculated samples, and the positive signal level remained high on days 3 and 7. the bacteria identification  array was proven to be useful as an alternative method to detect and monitor target bacteria populations during food fermentation.

TI  == antagonistic intestinal microflora produces antimicrobial substance inhibitory to pseudomonas species and other spoilage organisms.
AB  == chicken intestine harbors a vast number of bacterial strains. in the present study, antimicrobial substance produced by lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of healthy chicken was detected, characterized, and purified. based on 16s rrna sequencing, the bacteria were identified as lactobacillus plantarum vn. the antimicrobial substance produced by this bacterium was designated vn-1 and exhibited a broad-spectrum of activity against  many important pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus, salmonella typhimurium, and erwinia amylovova. vn-1 was determined to be thermostable, insensitive to ph  values ranging from 2.0 to 8.0, resistant to various organic solvents and to enzymatic inactivation. the inhibition kinetics displayed a bactericidal mode of  action. this study revealed an antimicrobial substance with low molecular mass of less than 1 kda as determined by ultrafiltration and having features not previously reported for lab isolated from chicken intestines. the detection of this antimicrobial substance addresses an important aspect of biotechnological control agents of spoilage caused by pseudomonas spp. and promises the possibility for preservation of refrigerated poultry meat. practical application: the newly characterized antimicrobial substance and designated as vn-1 may have the potential to be used in food preservation.

TI  == binding and cellular activation studies reveal that toll-like receptor 2 can differentially recognize peptidoglycan from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == although much progress has been made toward the identification of innate immune receptors, far less is known about how these receptors recognize specific microbial products. such studies have been hampered by the need to purify compounds from microbial sources and a reliance on biological assays rather than  direct binding to monitor recognition. we have employed surface plasmon resonance (spr) binding studies using a wide range of well defined synthetic muropeptides derived from gram-positive (lysine-containing) and gram-negative (diaminopimelic  acid (dap)-containing) bacteria to demonstrate that toll-like receptor 2 can recognize peptidoglycan (pgn). in the case of lysine-containing muropeptides, a limited number of compounds, which were derived from pgn remodeled by bacterial autolysins, was recognized. however, a wider range of dap-containing muropeptides was bound with high affinity, and these compounds were derived from nascent and remodeled pgn. the difference in recognition of the two classes of muropeptides is proposed to be a strategy by the host to respond appropriately to gram-negative and -positive bacteria, which produce vastly different quantities of pgn. it was also found that certain modifications of the carboxylic acids of isoglutamine and dap can dramatically reduce binding, and thus, bacterial strains may employ such modifications to evade innate immune detection. cellular activation studies employing highly purified pgn from bacillus licheniformis, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, lactobacillus plantarum, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus support the structure binding relationship. the data firmly establish toll-like receptor 2 as an innate immune sensor for pgn and provides an understanding of host-pathogen interactions at the molecular level.

TI  == purification and characterization of plantaricin lr14: a novel bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum lr/14.
AB  == bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum strain lr/14 was purified to homogeneity by a multi-step protocol consisting of ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography, gel-filtration, and reverse-phase  fplc. l. plantarum lr/14 secreted a low-molecular-weight bacteriocin consisting of two peptides designated as plantaricin lr14alpha and -beta with molecular mass of 3,012.46 and 5,605.74 da, respectively. the purified peptides were characterized to be highly thermostable and active in acidic ph range, with a pi  of >10.0. both alpha and beta peptides showed bactericidal mode of action against indicator strain, micrococcus luteus and together showed a synergistic action. these peptides were differentially sensitive to a range of proteolytic enzymes, indicating differences in their composition. amino acid sequencing revealed that  the n-terminus in both the cases is blocked; thus, only a partial sequence could  be obtained after cnbr digestion. these sequences, when compared with those available in the database, showed no homology with known bacteriocins, indicating it to be a novel compound.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of long-chain, water-soluble, dendritic tricarboxylato amphiphiles.
AB  == objectives: to measure the antimicrobial activities of three series of homologous, dendritic tricarboxylato (three-headed) amphiphiles against a battery of bacteria and fungi. methods: three series of homologous dendritic amphiphiles  were synthesized containing c13 to c22 fatty chains. susceptibility of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, lactobacillus plantarum, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), mycobacterium smegmatis, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida albicans, cryptococcus neoformans and aspergillus niger to the amphiphiles was measured by broth microdilution and reported as the mic. results: several amphiphiles from each homologous series, designed and constructed to overcome the low solubility of saturated long-chain fatty acids, had antimicrobial activity against mrsa (mic =  36 mg/l), c. albicans (mic = 4.4 mg/l), s. cerevisiae (mic = 1.1 mg/l) and m. smegmatis (mic = 8.9 mg/l). these amphiphiles had considerably better antimicrobial activities than the corresponding saturated fatty acids. alkyl chain length influenced the values of mic; longer chains (c18-c22) were generally more antimicrobial, but there was no uniform pattern among the microorganisms tested. conclusions: as the antimicrobial activity of the amphiphiles increased with increasing chain length, it is anticipated that maximum activity was not reached with these series. thus, the identification of the optimal chain length would provide a target compound for development of low-cost, topical microbicides and anti-infectives. further, these series of dendritic amphiphiles with the very long chains can be used as new water-soluble probes for elucidation of membrane structure and for identification of novel targets for antimicrobial design.

TI  == distribution of epiphytic bacteria on olive leaves and the influence of leaf age  and sampling time.
AB  == mesophilic heterotrophic, aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria that grow on yeast tryptone glucose extract agar were isolated from the surface of olive leaves of 3 or 4 different ages in january, april, july, and october from 1984 to 1989. unweighted average linkage cluster analysis on either the jaccard coefficient or the simple matching coefficient recovered 1,701 representative strains in 32 phena defined at the 70% and 80% similarity level, respectively. of these, 25 were identified to genus or lower level. from the identity of the representative strains, the frequency of occurrence among the phylloplane bacteria over the 6-year period was estimated at 51% forpseudomonas syringae, followed byxanthomonas campestris (6.7%),erwinia herbicola (6%),acetobacter aceti (4.7%),gluconobacter oxydans (4.3%),pseudomonas fluorescens (3.9%),bacillus megaterium (3.8%),leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp.dextranicum (3.1%),lactobacillus plantarum (2.8%),curtobacterium plantarum (2.2%),micrococcus luteus (2.2%),arthrobacter globiformis (1.4%),klebsiella planticola (1.2%),streptococcus faecium (1.2%),clavibacter sp. (0.98%),micrococcus sp. (0.82%),serratia marcescens (0.81%),bacillus subtilis (0.57%),cellulomonas flavigena (0.4%),erwinia sp. (0.37%),zymomonas mobilis (0.3%),bacillus sp. (0.29%),alcaligenes faecalis (0.27%),erwinia carotovora (0.08%), andpseudomonas aeruginosa (0.04%). bacterial communities on leaves of a given age at a given time during any one year displayed a very similar structure but differed significantly from those on the leaves of the same age at a different time or on  the leaves of a different age at any time during any one year. communities on the leaves of a given age at a given time of the year were invariably dominated by one or another of only 9 taxa, which accounted for 22 to 98.5% of the isolates from those leaves. the communities on 10- and 13-month-old leaves were invariably made up of fewer taxa than those on younger leaves at the same time of the year.

TI  == the occurrence and growth of microorganisms during the fermentation of fish sausage.
AB  == minced fish (mullet) sausage mixes containing added sugar, salt, nitrate, nitrite and spices were fermented (48 h, 30 degrees c) by indigenous flora or by a starter culture (pediococcus acidilactici) and the microbial ecology and behaviour of various bacteria was monitored. pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus plantarum dominated the indigenous fermentation, achieving populations of 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g by 48 h, and decreasing the ph of the mix to 4.5-4.7. significant growth (10(5)-10(7) cfu/g) of staphylococcus warneri, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis. micrococcus varians and micrococcus luteus also occurred during this fermentation. less growth was exhibited by bacillus megaterium and yeasts. pediococcus acidilactici dominated the fermentation when it was inoculated as a starter culture, but indigenous lactic acid bacteria (p. pentosaceus and l. plantarum) also grew to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g. the growth of other bacteria and yeasts was restricted during fermentation with starter culture. inoculated escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella sofia, and staphylococcus aureus grew to 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g in the sausage mix during indigenous fermentation. lesser growth occurred for bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and vibrio parahaemolyticus. growth of these bacteria was significantly inhibited in sausage mix fermented with p. acidilactici.

TI  == nonspecific and cooperative binding of lectins to microorganisms.
AB  == binding of lectins to microbial cell walls was investigated by fluorimetric titration and scatchard plot. data were correlated with agglutinability. concanavalin a and lectins of wheat germ, soybean, pea, lentil, and peanut were tested against escherichia coli. micrococcus luteus, lactobacillus plantarum, and bacillus subtilis. in cases where binding occurred, it was either nonspecific or  positively cooperative. agglutination was observed only in those combinations of  lectin and microorganism that showed positive cooperative binding, suggesting a definite relation between binding and agglutination. lectins binding to the same  carbohydrate did not necessarily bind to the same microorganism, confirming the complexity of the lectin-receptor bond.
