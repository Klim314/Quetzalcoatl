antibacterial effect of the adhering human lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb.
the spent culture supernatant of the human lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb produces an antibacterial activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens.
it decreased the in vitro viability of staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter spp. in contrast, it did not inhibit lactobacilli and bifidobacteria.
the activity was heat stable and relatively sensitive to enzymatic treatments and developed under acidic conditions.
the antimicrobial activity was independent of lactic acid production.
activity against s. typhimurium sl1344 infecting human cultured intestinal caco-2 cells was observed as it was in the conventional c3h/he/oujco mouse model with s. typhimurium c5 infection and oral treatment with the lb spent culture supernatant.
