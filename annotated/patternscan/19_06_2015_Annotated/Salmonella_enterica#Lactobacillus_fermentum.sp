TI  == effect of white mustard essential oil on the growth of foodborne pathogens and spoilage microorganisms and the effect of food components on its efficacy.
AB  == antimicrobial preservative compounds are added to foods to target specific pathogens and spoilage organisms. white mustard essential oil (wmeo) is an extract that contains 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate, a compound which has been demonstrated to have antimicrobial activity in limited studies. the objective of  this research was to determine the in vitro antimicrobial activity of wmeo against gram-positive and gram-negative spoilage and pathogenic bacteria and determine the effect of food components on the antimicrobial activity. the bacteria escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, enterobacter  aerogenes, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, and lactobacillus fermentum, as well as the acid- and preservative-resistant yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe, were evaluated. all microorganisms were inhibited by wmeo at 8.3 g/liter (equivalent to 1,000 mg/liter 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate). in general, wmeo was more effective against gram-negative than against gram-positive bacteria. salmonella enteritidis and s. pombe were the most sensitive, with inhibition at as low as 2.1 g/liter. the effects on growth profiles varied but included increased lag phases and lethality, indicating both  bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity. soybean oil had a negative effect on the efficacy of wmeo against l. monocytogenes, and at 5% soybean oil, the antimicrobial activity against salmonella enteritidis was eliminated after 48 h.  sodium caseinate at 1% also negated the antimicrobial effect of wmeo against salmonella enteritidis and decreased its effectiveness against l. monocytogenes.  the presence of starch had no significant effect on the antimicrobial activity of wmeo against l. monocytogenes and salmonella enteritidis. thus, wmeo is effective against a wide range of microorganisms and has potential to be used in foods, depending upon the target microorganism and food components present.

TI  == pathogen exclusion properties of canine probiotics are influenced by the growth media and physical treatments simulating industrial processes.
AB  == aims: manufacturing process used in preparation of probiotic products may alter beneficial properties of probiotics. the effect of different growth media and inactivation methods on the protective properties of canine-originated probiotic  bacteria against adhesion of canine enteropathogens was investigated. methods and results: three established dog probiotics, lactobacillus fermentum vet9a, lactobacillus plantarum vet14a and lactobacillus rhamnosus vet16a, and their mixture were assessed using the dog mucus pathogen exclusion model. the pathogens used were enterococcus canis, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and clostridium perfringens. the effect of growth media, one reflecting laboratory and the other manufacture conditions, and viability (viable and heat inactivated, 80 degrees c per 30 min) on the pathogen exclusion properties of probiotics were  characterized. greater pathogen exclusion percentages were noted for probiotics growing in conditions reflecting manufacture when compared to laboratory (p < 0.05). inactivation of probiotics by heat (80 degrees c per 30 min) increased pathogen exclusion compared with their viable forms (p < 0.05). conclusions: manufacturing process conditions such as growth media, incubation temperature and pretreatment methods may significantly affect the protective properties of the tested strains. significance and impact of the study: growing conditions and pretreatment methods should be carefully considered when designing new probiotics to reduce the risk of common infections in dogs. the studied probiotics are promising potential feed additives for dogs.

TI  == tailoring the probiotic potential of non-starter lactobacillus strains from ripened parmigiano reggiano cheese by in vitro screening and principal component  analysis.
AB  == non-starter lactic acid bacteria (nslab) inhabiting fermented food have been recently revised as source of probiotic strains. here, we in vitro assessed the potential probiotic aptitude of a de-replicated set of nslab previously isolated  from long ripened parmigiano reggiano cheeses (22 lactobacillus rhamnosus, 18 lactobacillus paracasei, 3 lactobacillus casei, 2 lactobacillus harbinensis, and  2 lactobacillus fermentum). most strains showed moderate to good resistance to biological barriers, including bile salts, lysozyme, and simulated gastric and pancreatic juices. antimicrobial susceptibility tests against seven antimicrobials belonging to different categories showed that most strains are susceptible towards all the antibiotics, with the exception of vancomycin and streptomycin. the strains lost the streptomycin resistance when assayed on agar medium containing 0.5% bile salts, suggesting that detergent-like properties of cholic acids increase membrane permeability and mediate streptomycin susceptibility. no isolate showed bile salt hydrolase (bsh) activities, supporting that bile salts resistance and bsh activity are unpaired traits. finally, nslab strains had moderate to high auto-aggregative and hydrophobic phenotypes, whereas two subsets of 22 and 8 strains co-aggregated with escherichia coli and salmonella enterica s. typhimurium, respectively. a multivariate analysis was effective to segregate one l. casei and two l. rhamnosus strains showing physiological characteristics compatible with probiotic properties.

TI  == effect of immersion and inoculation in ovo of lactobacillus spp. in embryonated chicken eggs in the prevention of salmonella enteritidis after hatch.
AB  == the protection level against salmonella enteritidis was evaluated in chickens after in ovo treatment with different species of lactobacillus spp. inoculated into the air cell or by immersion in broth culture. two hundred forty embryonated eggs were distributed into 8 groups, corresponding to treatments with lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus salivarius, and control. on d 18 of incubation, 4 groups were inoculated with 0.1 ml of inoculum  in the air cell and 4 groups were immersed for 3 min in culture of each treatment. two days after hatching, 0.5 ml of salmonella enteritidis culture was  inoculated by the intraesophageal route. on d 5 of life, the chicks were euthanized and the ceca were processed to obtain salmonella enteritidis counts. there was no decrease in salmonella enteritidis colonization of chick ceca, regardless of treatment or route of administration. lactobacillus spp. samples used in the treatment showed no probiotic potential in chicks when inoculated in  ovo, in relation to salmonella enteritidis inhibition in poultry ceca.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == antimicrobial and safety properties of lactobacilli isolated from two cameroonian traditional fermented foods.
AB  == twenty-one lactobacillus isolates from "sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. these isolates were preliminarily identified as lactobacillus plantarum (62%), lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-pcr genomic fingerprinting. twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, proteinase k) and inhibition of other lactobacillus spp. these  bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin g, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. the bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria,  several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the world health organization, as well as multidrug-resistant strains. these include staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare typhi, bacillus cereus, streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella pneumoniae and shigella flexneri. these lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.

TI  == strain dependent protection conferred by lactobacillus spp. administered orally with a salmonella typhimurium vaccine in a murine challenge model.
AB  == consumption of lactobacillus spp. has been shown to enhance immune responses in mice. this study examined the immuno-adjuvant capacity of two strains: lactobacillus acidophilus l10 and lactobacillus fermentum pc2, in the induction of protective humoral immunity in a salmonella typhimurium vaccine challenge model. briefly, balb/c mice were divided into four groups. three groups of mice received s. typhimurium vaccine (10(8) colony forming units (cfu) per dose) on days 0 and 14. in addition to the vaccine, five doses (10(8) cfu per dose) of either l. acidophilus l10 or l. fermentum pc2 were also administered to a group.  all mice were challenged with viable s. typhimurium on day 28. on day 10 post challenge, the study was terminated and microbial and immunological parameters were assessed. mice dosed with l. fermentum pc2 in addition to the vaccine had a  significantly enhanced s. typhimurium humoral response. the mice in this group had high levels of lactobacilli in the feces and in association with the peyer's  patches, no detectable levels of either lactobacilli or s. typhimurium in the spleen, and no detectable weight loss. mice given l. acidophilus l10 with the vaccine were unable to exhibit elevated s. typhimurium specific humoral responses. however, there was no detectable s. typhimurium in the spleens of this group. interestingly, translocation of lactobacilli into the spleen was observed  as well as a slight weight loss was noted in mice that received the l. acidophilus l10 with the vaccine. this study shows that, the l. fermentum pc2 had a greater capacity than the l. acidophilus l10 to act as an oral adjuvant in a s. typhimurium oral vaccine program and afforded greater protection against a live s. typhimurium challenge.

TI  == lactobacillus fermentum isolated from human colonic mucosal biopsy inhibits the growth and adhesion of enteric and foodborne pathogens.
AB  == a number of lactobacillus species are used as probiotic strains in order to benefit health. we have isolated l. fermentum from human colonic mucosal biopsy samples that possess antimicrobial activities against entroinvasive and foodborne pathogens such as escherichia coli, salmonella paratyphi a, shigella sonnei, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio sp. in addition to lactic acid, l. fermentum secretes antimicrobial proteinacious compound(s) that was found to be active even at neutral ph (ph 7.0). the compound was sensitive to heat treatment and trypsin digestion. lactobacillus fermentum inhibited the adhesion of enteropathogens to intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. isolated cell surface associated proteins (saps) from l. fermentum were sufficient for the adhesion exclusions of enteropathogenic e. coli. our results indicate that l. fermentum produces antimicrobial compounds and saps to inhibit the growth and adhesion of enteropathogens, respectively.

TI  == immunological, antioxidative, and morphological response in combined treatment of ofloxacin and lactobacillus fermentum me-3 probiotic in salmonella typhimurium murine model.
AB  == we aimed to elucidate the immunological (cytokines), biochemical (antioxidative), and patho-morphological responses in the gut and liver evoked by the addition of  lactobacillus fermentum me-3 to ofloxacin (ofx) treatment in an experimental infection model of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. after challenge with  s. typhimurium and treatment according to different schemes, either with ofx and/or addition of l. fermentum me-3, the mice were killed. blood, liver, spleen, and small intestine samples were plated to detect s. typhimurium and lactobacilli. histological slides were prepared from the liver and ileum. the cytokines (il-10, ifn-gamma, and tnf-alpha), the glutathione peroxidase and reductase, the glutathione ratio, and the lipid peroxides (lpo) in mucosa of the  small intestine and liver were estimated. the addition of l. fermentum me-3 to ofx increased the eradication of s. typhimurium from tested sites because of antagonistic and antioxidative properties, reduced the presence of typhoid nodules in the liver, and decreased the values of lpo. the immunological response included the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines interferon-gamma and tumour  necrosis factor-alpha and the increase in anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 in the livers of mice without typhoid nodules.

TI  == detection of changes in the cellular composition of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium in the presence of antimicrobial compound(s) of lactobacillus strains using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
AB  == it was previously established that lactobacillus fermentum aca-dc 179, lactobacillus plantarum aca-dc 287 and lactobacillus plantarum aca-dc 2350 exhibit antimicrobial activity against salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. in order to further investigate the killing effect of these microorganisms against salmonella cells, we employed fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ft-ir). salmonella cells were incubated with different concentrated lactobacilli supernatants and their ft-ir spectra were recorded. the second derivative transformation of the original spectra revealed changes in spectral regions corresponding to absorptions of major cellular constituents (e.g. cell wall, cell membrane, and proteins of the cell) among the salmonella cells treated with the supernatants and those treated with the control samples. principal component analysis of the second derivative transformed spectra showed that the yet unidentified antimicrobial compound(s) produced by the lactobacilli tested clearly interfered with the fatty acids of the cell membrane, as well as the polysaccharides of the cell wall in salmonella cells, pointing towards a dual killing mode. our study shed light for the first time in the anti-salmonella activity of the particular lactobacillus strains.

TI  == functional properties of novel protective lactic acid bacteria and application in raw chicken meat against listeria monocytogenes and salmonella enteritidis.
AB  == in this study 635 lactic acid bacteria of food origin were evaluated for their potential application as protective cultures in foods. a stepwise selection method was used to obtain the most appropriate strains for application as protective cultures in chicken meat. specifically, all strains were examined for  antimicrobial activity against various gram positive and gram negative pathogenic and spoilage bacteria. strains exhibiting anti-bacterial activity were subsequently examined for survival in simulated food processing and gastrointestinal tract conditions, such as high temperatures, low ph, starvation  and the presence of nacl and bile salts. selected strains where then examined for basic safety properties such as antibiotic resistance and haemolytic potential, while their antimicrobial activity was further investigated by pcr screening for  possession of known bacteriocin genes. two chosen strains were then applied on raw chicken meat to evaluate their protective ability against two common food pathogens, listeria monocytogenes and salmonella enteritidis, but also to identify potential spoilage effects by the application of the protective cultures on the food matrix. antimicrobial activity in vitro was evident against gram positive indicators, mainly listeria and brochothrix spp., while no antibacterial activity was obtained against any of the gram negative bacteria tested. the antimicrobial activity was of a proteinaceous nature while strains with anti-listerial activity were found to possess one or more bacteriocin genes, mainly enterocins. strains generally exhibited sensitivity to ph 2.0, but good survival at 45 degrees c, in the presence of bile salts and nacl as well as during starvation, while variable survival rates were obtained at 55 degrees c. none of the strains was found to be haemolytic while variable antibiotic resistance profiles were obtained. finally, when the selected strains enterococcus faecium pcd71 and lactobacillus fermentum aca-dc179 were applied as  protective cultures in chicken meat against l. monocytogenes and s. enteritidis respectively, a significantly reduced growth of these pathogenic bacteria was observed. in addition, these two strains did not appear to have any detrimental effect on biochemical parameters related to spoilage of the chicken meat.

TI  == probiotic potential of lactic acid bacteria isolated from fermented dairy milks on antiproliferation of colon cancer cells.
AB  == fifty-four strains of lactic acid bacteria obtained from fermented dairy milks were investigated for possible use as probiotics and for colon cancer biological  products. five of these strains inhibited growth of eight food-borne pathogens including helicobacter pylori, escherichia coli, and salmonella typhimurium. three of these strains survived at ph 2.5 and in 0.3% bile salts. additionally they produced no haemolysis, were resistant to kanamycin and adhered to caco-2 cells. 16s rrna gene sequences of probiotic strains indicated that rm11 and rm28  were enterococcus faecium and lactobacillus fermentum, respectively. both the cultured medium and live whole cells from probiotic strains were tested for antiproliferation of colon cancer cells through mtt and trypan blue exclusion assays. the probiotic strains of e. faecium rm11 and l. fermentum rm28 also triggered antiproliferation of colon cancer cells at the rates of 21-29%, and 22-29%, respectively. this suggested that both strains could be used as potential probiotics in functional food or for colon cancer biological products.

TI  == isolation and characterization of potential probiotic lactobacilli from pig feces.
AB  == this study examined four lactobacilli isolated from pig feces. two hundred lactic acid bacteria strains were obtained from pig feces using selective culture media  (with vancomycin and bromocresol green; termed lamvab agar). microscopy, the catalase test, gram-staining, and rapd-pcr analysis were used to group the bacteria into 20 related clusters. phenotypic analysis using the api 50 ch test and genotypic analysis of 16s rdna sequences identified these clusters as representing single strains of each of lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus reuteri. bacterial survival under the conditions of low ph (2.0) and high concentration (5.0%, w/v)  of bile salt was much better than that of the reference strain (lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 33199). the isolated bacteria were quite capable of inhibiting the growth of two pathogens, escherichia coli k88 and salmonella typhimurium. the high acid-resistance, bile resistance and antagonism against pathogens, suggest that the four lactic acid bacteria isolated from pig feces could prove useful as  piglet probiotics.

TI  == eradication of salmonella typhimurium infection in a murine model of typhoid fever with the combination of probiotic lactobacillus fermentum me-3 and ofloxacin.
AB  == background: the aim of the study was to detect whether in experimental salmonella enterica typhimurium infection the probiotic lactobacillus fermentum me-3 in combination with fluoroquinolone therapy would eradicate s. typhimurium, prevent  the development of liver and spleen granulomas and improve the indices of oxidative stress in the ileum mucosa. the selected bacteriological, histological  and biochemical methods were applied. results: combined treatment with l. fermentum me-3 and ofloxacin eradicated salmonella typhimurium from blood, ileum  and liver, decreased the number of animals with liver and spleen granulomas and reduced the value of lipid peroxides in the ileum mucosa. higher total counts of  intestinal lactobacilli in all experimental groups were associated with the absence of liver granulomas. conclusion: the antimicrobial and antioxidative probiotic l. fermentum me-3 combined with ofloxacin enhances the eradication of experimental s. typhimurium infection. these observations on probiotic and antimicrobial co-action may serve as basis to develop new strategies for treatment of invasive bacterial infections of the gut.

TI  == bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus strains isolated from poto poto, a congolese  fermented maize product, and genetic fingerprinting of their plantaricin operons.
AB  == thirty one bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus isolates were identified among 135 lactobacilli isolated from the congolese fermented maize product poto poto, during the preparation and from the finished product. using species-specific pcr  and 16s rrna gene sequencing, 28 and 3 isolates were identified as l. plantarum and l. fermentum, respectively. cluster analysis of rapd-pcr fingerprints revealed two main groups (g1 and g2) plus the l. fermentum isolate c4-13. group g1 contained 23 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 74.5%, and could be divided in two subgroups (g1-1, g1-2) each with several branches, plus the l. plantarum isolate c11. group g2 contained 8 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 86%, with two main branches. using pcr amplification with specific  primers, several genes of the plantaricin cluster found in l. plantarum c11 were  identified in the isolates. the number of genes that were detected varied between the strains. the l. fermentum isolate ec11 also contained the plndefg genes. pcr  amplification of dna from isolates with primers directed to the upstream and downstream region of the plantaricin cluster generated an amplicon identical to that obtained with dna from the control strain l. plantarum wcfs1. amplification  products from the positive strains were used for restriction analysis with hindiii, ecori and kpni in separate reactions. cluster analysis of restriction profiles revealed high similarities for ecori and hindii digest profiles, and an  identical profile for all kpni digests. the l. fermentum ec11 isolate clustered with l. plantarum strains in a group with a high correlation coefficient. the results suggest a low degree of diversity in the plantarincin gene cluster. however, other strains that tested positive for individual plantaricin genes may  present great heterogeneity in the plantaricin operons. because of their broad spectra of inhibition (including escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, enterobacter aerogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and enterococcus faecalis), isolates from the present study could  be used to improve the safety and storage stability of poto poto.

TI  == functional properties of selected starter cultures for sour maize bread.
AB  == this paper focuses on the functional properties of maize sour-dough microflora selected and tested for their use as starter cultures for sour maize bread. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolated from spontaneously fermented maize dough were selected based on dominance during fermentation and presence at the end of fermentation. functional properties examined included acidification, leavening and production of some antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting matrix. the organisms previously identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. fermentum, lb. acidophilus, pediococcus acidilactici, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc dextranicum and saccharomyces cerevisiae were used singly and as  mixed cultures in the fermentation (fermentation time: 12h at 28+/-2 degrees c) of maize meal (particle size >0.2mm). the ph fell from an initial value of 5.62-3.05 in maize meals fermented with lb. plantarum; 4.37 in l. dextranicum+s.  cerevisiae compared with the value for the control (no starter) of 4.54. significant differences (p <or =0.05) were observed in values obtained for the functional properties tested when starters were inoculated compared with the control (no starter) except for leavening. bivariate correlations at 0.01 levels  (two-tailed) showed that significant correlations existed among ph and production of antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting meals, the highest correlation being between production of diacetyl and acid (0.694), a positive correlation indicating that production of both antimicrobial compounds increase together with time. antimicrobial activities of the fermented maize dough were confirmed by their abilities to inhibit the growth of salmonella typhi, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and aspergillus flavus from an initial inoculum concentration of 7 log cfu ml(-1)) for test bacteria and zone of inhibition of up to 1.33 cm for aflatoxigenic a. flavus. the findings of this study form a database for further studies on the development of starter cultures for sour maize bread production as an alternative bread specialty.

TI  == disinfectant test against monoculture and mixed-culture biofilms composed of technological, spoilage and pathogenic bacteria: bactericidal effect of essential oil and hydrosol of satureja thymbra and comparison with standard acid-base sanitizers.
AB  == aims: to assess the antimicrobial action of three natural-derived products (essential oil, decoction and hydrosol of satureja thymbra) against biofilms, composed of useful, spoilage and pathogenic bacteria (formed as monoculture or/and mixed-culture), and to compare their efficiency with three standard acid and alkaline chemical disinfectants. methods and results: two acids (hydrochloric and lactic, ph 3), one alkali (sodium hydroxide, ph 11), the essential oil of s.  thymbra (1% v/v) and the two by-products of the essential oil purification procedure (the decoction and the hydrosol fraction of essential oil, 100%), were  tested against biofilms formed by five bacterial species, either as monospecies,  or as mixed-culture of all species. the tested bacterial species were staphylococcus simulans and lactobacillus fermentum (useful technological bacteria), pseudomonas putida (spoilage bacterium), salmonella enterica and listeria monocytogenes (pathogenic bacteria). biofilms were left to be formed on  stainless steel coupons for 5 days at 16 degrees c, before the application of disinfection treatments, for 60 and 180 min. the disinfection efficiency was evaluated by detaching the remaining viable biofilm cells and enumerating them by agar plating, as well as by automated conductance measurements (using rapid automated bacterial impedance technique). both these methods revealed that the essential oil and the hydrosol of s. thymbra exhibited a strong antimicrobial action against both monospecies and mixed-culture biofilms. surprisingly, the efficiency of the other three acid-base disinfectants was not adequate, although  a long antimicrobial treatment was applied (180 min). conclusions: the essential  oil of s. thymbra (1%), as well as its hydrosol fraction (100%), presents sufficient bactericidal effect on bacterial biofilms formed on stainless steel. significance and impact of the study: use of natural antimicrobial agents could provide alternative or supplemented ways for the disinfection of microbial-contaminated industrial surfaces.

TI  == antagonistic activity of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria against entero- and uropathogens.
AB  == aim: to develop in vitro assays for comparing the antagonistic properties and anti-oxidative activity of probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains against various entero- and urinary pathogens. methods and results: the antagonistic activity of five probiotic lactobacilli (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus fermentum me-3, lactobacillus acidophilus la5, lactobacillus plantarum 299v and lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2) and two bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium lactis bb12, bifidobacterium longum 46) against six target pathogens was estimated using different assays (solid and liquid media, anaerobic and microaerobic cultivation) and ranked (low, intermediate and high). bacterial  fermentation products were determined by gas chromatography, and the total anti-oxidative activity of probiotics was measured using linolenic acid test. pyelonephritic escherichia coli was highly suppressed by gg and both bifidobacteria strains. lactobacilli strains 8700:2, 299v and me-3 were the most  effective against salmonella enterica ssp. enterica in microaerobic while me-3 and both bifidobacteria expressed high activity against shigella sonnei in anaerobic milieu. lact. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. plantarum strains showed intermediate antagonistic activity against helicobacter pylori under microaerobic conditions on solid media. the highest anti-oxidative activity was characteristic for lact. fermentum me-3 (p < 0.05). no efficient antagonist against clostridium difficile was found. the positive correlations between the ph, lactic acid production and anti-microbial activity for all tested probiotics  were assessed. conclusions: developed experimental assays enable to compare the anti-microbial and -oxidative activity of lactobacillus and/or bifidobacterium probiotics, which have been claimed to possess the ability of suppressing the growth of various enteric and urinary pathogens. significance and impact of the study: screening lactobacillus and bifidobacterium sp. strains according to their activity in various environmental conditions could precede the clinical efficacy  studies for adjunct treatment with probiotics in cure of different gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections.

TI  == lactobacillus flora in the cloaca and vagina of hens and its inhibitory activity  against salmonella enteritidis in vitro.
AB  == lactobacilli in the cloaca and vagina of 40 normal laying hens were investigated  quantitatively and qualitatively, and their ability to inhibit growth of salmonella enteritidis (se) was examined using a spot-the-lawn technique. all samples of cloacal contents and half the samples of vaginal mucus were positive for lactobacilli. the means +/- sd of total lactobacillus counts in the cloaca and those in the vagina were log10 5.5 +/- 1.1 and 2.5 +/- 2.6 cfu/g, respectively. in the cloaca, lactobacillus acidophilus was isolated from 92.5% of hens, and lactobacillus salivarius was isolated from 85.0% of hens, whereas lactobacillus fermentum was isolated from only one hen. in the vagina, l. acidophilus and l. salivarius were isolated from 42.5% of hens. in the inhibition assay in vitro, all strains of lactobacillus from cloacal contents and vaginal mucus inhibited growth of se. there was a wide range of the inhibitory activity even in the same species. no difference of the growth inhibition zone was observed between lactobacilli from cloaca and those from vagina. the present study suggested that lactobacilli in the cloaca and vagina of hens might have a protective effect against se colonization.

TI  == antibacterial activity of lactobacillus species against vibrio species.
AB  == forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.
