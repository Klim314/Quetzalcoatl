TI  == specific gut microbiota features and metabolic markers in postmenopausal women with obesity.
AB  == background: gut microbial gene richness and specific bacterial species are associated with metabolic risk markers in humans, but the impact of host physiology and dietary habits on the link between the gut microbiota and metabolic markers remain unclear. the objective of this study was to identify gut metagenomic markers associated with estimates of insulin resistance, lipid metabolism and inflammation in obesity, and to explore whether the associations between metagenomic and metabolic markers persisted after adjustment for body fat, age and habitual dietary intake. methods: faecal dna from 53 women with obesity was analysed through quantitative metagenomic sequencing and analysis, and a systematic search was performed for bacterial genes associated with estimates of insulin resistance, inflammation and lipid metabolism. subsequently, the correlations between metagenomic species and metabolic markers were tested by linear regression models, with and without covariate adjustment. results: one hundred and fourteen metagenomic species correlated with metabolic markers (p<0.001) including akkermansia muciniphila, bilophila wadsworthia, bifidobacterium longum and faecalibacterium prausnitzii, but also species not previously associated with metabolic markers including bacteroides faecis and dorea longicatena. the majority of the identified correlations between bacterial  species and metabolic markers persisted after adjustment for differences in body  fat, age and dietary macronutrient composition; however, the negative correlation with insulin resistance observed for b. longum and f. prausnitzii appeared to be  modified by the intake of dietary fibre and fat, respectively. conclusions: this  study shows that several gut bacterial species are linked to metabolic risk markers in obesity, also after adjustment for potential confounders, such as long-term diet composition. the study supports the use of gut metagenomic markers for metabolic disease prediction and warrants further investigation of causality.

TI  == identification of an anti-inflammatory protein from faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a commensal bacterium deficient in crohn's disease.
AB  == background: crohn's disease (cd)-associated dysbiosis is characterised by a loss  of faecalibacterium prausnitzii, whose culture supernatant exerts an anti-inflammatory effect both in vitro and in vivo. however, the chemical nature  of the anti-inflammatory compounds has not yet been determined. methods: peptidomic analysis using mass spectrometry was applied to f. prausnitzii supernatant. anti-inflammatory effects of identified peptides were tested in vitro directly on intestinal epithelial cell lines and on cell lines transfected  with a plasmid construction coding for the candidate protein encompassing these peptides. in vivo, the cdna of the candidate protein was delivered to the gut by  recombinant lactic acid bacteria to prevent dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (dnbs)-colitis in mice. results: the seven peptides, identified in the f. prausnitzii culture supernatants, derived from a single microbial anti-inflammatory molecule (mam), a protein of 15 kda, and comprising 53% of non-polar residues. this last feature prevented the direct characterisation of the putative anti-inflammatory activity of mam-derived peptides. transfection of  mam cdna in epithelial cells led to a significant decrease in the activation of the nuclear factor (nf)-kappab pathway with a dose-dependent effect. finally, the use of a food-grade bacterium, lactococcus lactis, delivering a plasmid encoding  mam was able to alleviate dnbs-induced colitis in mice. conclusions: a 15 kda protein with anti-inflammatory properties is produced by f. prausnitzii, a commensal bacterium involved in cd pathogenesis. this protein is able to inhibit  the nf-kappab pathway in intestinal epithelial cells and to prevent colitis in an animal model.

TI  == the intestinal microbiome in spondyloarthritis.
AB  == purpose of review: microbial dysbiosis in the gut is emerging as a common component in various inflammatory disorders including spondyloarthritis (spa). the depth of this influence has begun to be realized with next-generation sequencing of the gut microbiome providing unbiased assessment of previously uncharted bacterial populations. recent findings: decreased numbers of firmicutes, a major phyla of gut commensals, especially the species faecalibacterium prausnitzii and clostridium leptum have been found in various inflammatory disorders including spa and inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), and could be an important link between spa and gut inflammation. multiple studies in  ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, juvenile spa, and animal models of spa are revealing common bacterial associations among these diseases as well as ibd. summary: we are beginning to appreciate the complex relationship between the gut microbiome and host immune regulation and dysregulation in health and disease. potentially important differences have been revealed in spa, but cause and effect relationships remain far from established. many critical questions remain to be answered before we can apply new knowledge to improve therapeutics in spa.

TI  == intestinal microbiota and allergic diseases: a systematic review.
AB  == evidence suggests that possible imbalances in intestinal microbiota composition may be implicated in the occurrence of allergic diseases. although several studies published until 2006 indicated a correlation between microbiota composition and allergic symptoms, it has not been possible to distinguish protective microorganisms from those associated with increased risk of allergic diseases. therefore, the objective of this study was to review the studies published since 2007 that address the intestinal microbiota in allergic diseases. twenty-one studies were identified after excluding those that performed a clinical intervention before stool collection. in the early microbiota of children who later developed allergies, lower bacterial diversity was observed, with a predominance of firmicutes; a higher count of bacteroidaceae; a higher prevalence of the anaerobic bacteria bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum, and  bifidobacterium longum; and a lower prevalence of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, and lactobacillus. in the microbiota of allergic children whose intestinal microbiota was assessed at the onset of allergic symptoms, there was a higher count of bacteroides; a lower count of akkermansia muciniphila, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and clostridium; a higher prevalence of b. adolescentis; a lower prevalence of b. catenulatum and staphylococcus aureus; and a lower bacterial diversity.

TI  == bacillus coagulans gbi-30, 6086 modulates faecalibacterium prausnitzii in older men and women.
AB  == background: advancing age is linked to a decrease in beneficial bacteria such as  bifidobacterium spp. and reduced aspects of innate immune function. objectives: we investigated whether daily consumption of a probiotic [bacillus coagulans gbi-30, 6086 (bc30); ganedenbc30] could improve immune function and gut function  in men and women aged 65-80 y, using a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. method: thirty-six volunteers were recruited and randomly assigned to receive either a placebo (microcrystalline cellulose) or the probiotic bc30 (1 x  109 colony-forming units/capsule). volunteers consumed 1 treatment capsule per day for 28 d, followed by a 21-d washout period before switching to the other treatment. blood and fecal samples were collected at the beginning and end of each treatment period. fecal samples were used to enumerate bacterial groups and  concentrations of calprotectin. peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) were extracted from whole blood to assess natural killer cell activity and lipopolysaccharide (lps)-stimulated cytokine production. c-reactive protein concentrations were measured in plasma. results: consumption of bc30 significantly increased populations of faecalibacterium prausnitzii by 0.1 log10  cells/ml more than during consumption of the placebo (p = 0.03), whereas populations of bacillus spp. increased significantly by 0.5 log10 cells/ml from baseline in volunteers who consumed bc30 (p = 0.007). lps-stimulated pbmcs showed a 0.2 ng/ml increase in the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 28 d after consumption of bc30 (p < 0.05), whereas the placebo did not affect il-10, and no  overall difference was found in the effect of the treatments. conclusions: daily  consumption of bc30 by adults aged 65-80 y can increase beneficial groups of bacteria in the human gut and potentially increase production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. this study shows the potential benefits of a probiotic to improve dysbiosis via modulation of the microbiota in older persons.

TI  == faecalibacterium prausnitzii strain htf-f and its extracellular polymeric matrix  attenuate clinical parameters in dss-induced colitis.
AB  == a decrease in the abundance and biodiversity of intestinal bacteria within the firmicutes phylum has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). in particular, the anti-inflammatory bacterium faecalibacterium prausnitzii, member  of the firmicutes phylum and one of the most abundant species in healthy human colon, is underrepresented in the microbiota of ibd patients. the aim of this study was to investigate the immunomodulatory properties of f. prausnitzii strain a2-165, the biofilm forming strain htf-f and the extracellular polymeric matrix (epm) isolated from strain htf-f. for this purpose, the immunomodulatory properties of the f. prausnitzii strains and the epm were studied in vitro using  human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. then, the capacity of the f. prausnitzii  strains and the epm of htf-f to suppress inflammation was assessed in vivo in the mouse dextran sodium sulphate (dss) colitis model. the f. prausnitzii strains and the epm had anti-inflammatory effects on the clinical parameters measured in the  dss model but with different efficacy. the immunomodulatory effects of the epm were mediated through the tlr2-dependent modulation of il-12 and il-10 cytokine production in antigen presenting cells, suggesting that it contributes to the anti-inflammatory potency of f. prausnitzii htf-f. the results show that f. prausnitzii htf-f and its epm may have a therapeutic use in ibd.

TI  == identification of metabolic signatures linked to anti-inflammatory effects of faecalibacterium prausnitzii.
AB  == faecalibacterium prausnitzii is an anti-inflammatory commensal bacterium identified on the basis of human clinical data. the mechanisms underlying its beneficial effects are still unknown. gnotobiotic mice harboring f. prausnitzii (a2-165) and escherichia coli (k-12 jm105) were subjected to 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (tnbs)-induced acute colitis. the inflammatory colitis scores and a gas chromatography-time of flight (gc/tof) mass spectrometry-based metabolomic profile were monitored in blood, ileum, cecum, colon, and feces in gnotobiotic mice. the potential anti-inflammatory metabolites were tested in vitro. we obtained stable e. coli and f. prausnitzii-diassociated  mice in which e. coli primed the gastrointestinal tract (git), allowing a durable and stable establishment of f. prausnitzii. the disease activity index, histological scores, myeloperoxidase (mpo) activity, and serum cytokine levels were significantly lower in the presence of f. prausnitzii after tnbs challenge.  the protective effect of f. prausnitzii against colitis was correlated to its implantation level and was linked to overrepresented metabolites along the git and in serum. among 983 metabolites in git samples and serum, 279 were assigned to known chemical reactions. some of them, belonging to the ammonia (alpha-ketoglutarate), osmoprotective (raffinose), and phenolic (including anti-inflammatory shikimic and salicylic acids) pathways, were associated with a  protective effect of f. prausnitzii, and the functional link was established in vitro for salicylic acid. we show for the first time that f. prausnitzii is a highly active commensal bacterium involved in reduction of colitis through in vivo modulation of metabolites along the git and in the peripheral blood. importance: inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd) are characterized by low proportions of f. prausnitzii in the gut microbiome. this commensal bacterium exhibits anti-inflammatory effects through still unknown mechanisms. stable monoassociated rodents are actually not a reproducible model to decipher f. prausnitzii protective effects. we propose a new gnotobiotic rodent model providing mechanistic clues. in this model, f. prausnitzii exhibits protective effects against an acute colitis and a protective metabolic profile is linked to  its presence along the digestive tract. we identified a molecule, salicylic acid, directly involved in the protective effect of f. prausnitzii. targeting its metabolic pathways could be an attractive therapeutic strategy in ibd.

TI  == faecalibacterium prausnitzii prevents physiological damages in a chronic low-grade inflammation murine model.
AB  == background: the human gut houses one of the most complex and abundant ecosystems  composed of up to 10(13)-10(14) microorganisms. the importance of this intestinal microbiota is highlighted when a disruption of the intestinal ecosystem equilibrium appears (a phenomenon called dysbiosis) leading to an illness status, such as inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd). indeed, the reduction of the commensal bacterium faecalibacterium prausnitzii (one of the most prevalent intestinal bacterial species in healthy adults) has been correlated with several diseases, including ibd, and most importantly, it has been shown that this bacterium has anti-inflammatory and protective effects in pre-clinical models of colitis. some  dysbiosis disorders are characterized by functional and physiological alterations. here, we report the beneficial effects of f. prausnitzii in the physiological changes induced by a chronic low-grade inflammation in a murine model. chronic low-grade inflammation and gut dysfunction were induced in mice by two episodes of dinitro-benzene sulfonic acid (dnbs) instillations. markers of inflammation, gut permeability, colonic serotonin and cytokine levels were studied. the effects of f. prausnitzii strain a2-165 and its culture supernatant  (sn) were then investigated. results: no significant differences were observed in classical inflammation markers confirming that inflammation was subclinical. however, gut permeability, colonic serotonin levels and the colonic levels of the cytokines il-6, inf-gamma, il-4 and il-22 were higher in dnbs-treated than in untreated mice. importantly, mice treated with either f. prausnitzii or its sn exhibited significant decreases in intestinal permeability, tissue cytokines and  serotonin levels. conclusions: our results show that f. prausnitzii and its sn had beneficial effects on intestinal epithelial barrier impairment in a chronic low-grade inflammation model. these observations confirm the potential of this bacterium as a novel probiotic treatment in the management of gut dysfunction and low-grade inflammation.

TI  == siblings of patients with crohn's disease exhibit a biologically relevant dysbiosis in mucosal microbial metacommunities.
AB  == objective: to determine the existence of mucosal dysbiosis in siblings of patients with crohn's disease (cd) using 454 pyrosequencing and to comprehensively characterise and determine the influence of genotypical and phenotypical factors, on that dysbiosis. siblings of patients with cd have elevated risk of developing cd and display aspects of disease phenotype, including faecal dysbiosis. whether the mucosal microbiota is disrupted in these  at-risk individuals is unknown. design: rectal biopsy dna was extracted from 21 patients with quiescent cd, 17 of their healthy siblings and 19 unrelated healthy controls. mucosal microbiota was analysed by 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing and were classified into core and rare species. genotypical risk was determined using illumina immuno beadchip, faecal calprotectin by elisa and blood t-cell phenotype by flow cytometry. results: core microbiota of both patients with cd and healthy  siblings was significantly less diverse than controls. metacommunity profiling (bray-curtis (sbc) index) showed the sibling core microbial composition to be more similar to cd (sbc=0.70) than to healthy controls, whereas the sibling rare  microbiota was more similar to healthy controls (sbc=0.42). faecalibacterium prausnitzii contributed most to core metacommunity dissimilarity both between siblings and controls, and between patients and controls. phenotype/genotype markers of cd risk significantly influenced microbiota variation between and within groups, of which genotype had the largest effect. conclusions: individuals with elevated cd-risk display mucosal dysbiosis characterised by reduced diversity of core microbiota and lower abundance of f. prausnitzii. this dysbiosis in healthy people at risk of cd implicates microbiological processes in cd pathogenesis.

TI  == recent advances in characterizing the gastrointestinal microbiome in crohn's disease: a systematic review.
AB  == background: the intestinal microbiota is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. a reduction in the diversity of the intestinal microbiota as well as specific taxonomic and functional shifts have been reported in crohn's disease and may play a central role in the inflammatory process. the aim was to systematically review recent developments in the structural and functional changes observed in the gastrointestinal microbiome in patients with crohn's disease. results: seventy-two abstracts were included in this review. the effects of host genetics, disease phenotype, and inflammatory bowel disease treatment on the gastrointestinal microbiome in crohn's disease were reviewed, and taxonomic shifts in patients with early and established disease were described. the relative abundance of bacteroidetes is increased and firmicutes decreased in crohn's disease compared with healthy controls. enterobacteriaceae,  specifically eschericia coli, is enriched in crohn's disease. faecalibacterium prausnitzii is found at lower abundance in crohn's disease and in those with postoperative recurrence. observed functional changes include major shifts in oxidative stress pathways, a decrease in butanoate and propanoate metabolism gene expression, lower levels of butyrate, and other short-chain fatty acids, decreased carbohydrate metabolism, and decreased amino acid biosynthesis. conclusions: changes in microbial composition and function have been described, although a causative role remains to be established. larger, prospective, and longitudinal studies are required with deep interrogation of the microbiome if causality is to be determined, and refined microbial manipulation is to emerge as a focused therapy.

TI  == gut microbiota and tacrolimus dosing in kidney transplantation.
AB  == tacrolimus dosing to establish therapeutic levels in recipients of organ transplants is a challenging task because of much interpatient and intrapatient variability in drug absorption, metabolism, and disposition. in view of the reported impact of gut microbial species on drug metabolism, we investigated the  relationship between the gut microbiota and tacrolimus dosing requirements in this pilot study of adult kidney transplant recipients. serial fecal specimens were collected during the first month of transplantation from 19 kidney transplant recipients who either required a 50% increase from initial tacrolimus  dosing during the first month of transplantation (dose escalation group, n=5) or  did not require such an increase (dose stable group, n=14). we characterized bacterial composition in the fecal specimens by deep sequencing of the pcr amplified 16s rrna v4-v5 region and we investigated the hypothesis that gut microbial composition is associated with tacrolimus dosing requirements. initial  tacrolimus dosing was similar in the dose escalation group and in the stable group (4.2 +/- 1.1 mg/day vs. 3.8 +/- 0.8 mg/day, respectively, p=0.61, two-way between-group anova using contrasts) but became higher in the dose escalation group than in the dose stable group by the end of the first transplantation month (9.6 +/- 2.4 mg/day vs. 3.3 +/- 1.5 mg/day, respectively, p<0.001). our systematic characterization of the gut microbial composition identified that fecal faecalibacterium prausnitzii abundance in the first week of transplantation was 11.8% in the dose escalation group and 0.8% in the dose stable group (p=0.002, wilcoxon rank sum test, p<0.05 after benjamini-hochberg correction for  multiple hypotheses). fecal faecalibacterium prausnitzii abundance in the first week of transplantation was positively correlated with future tacrolimus dosing at 1 month (r=0.57, p=0.01) and had a coefficient +/- standard error of 1.0 +/- 0.6 (p=0.08) after multivariable linear regression. our novel observations may help further explain inter-individual differences in tacrolimus dosing to achieve therapeutic levels.

TI  == [quantitation of intestinal fusobacterium and butyrate- producing bacteria in patients with colorectal adenomas and colorectal cancer].
AB  == objective: to compare the abundance of 16s rrna gene of intestinal fusobacterium  and butyrate-producing bacteria in patients with colorectal adenomas patients and colorectal cancer and to reveal the correlation between the target bacteria and the development of colorectal cancer. methods: feces were collected from colorectal cancer patients (n=19), colorectal adenomas patients (n=12) and healthy subjects (n=19). bacteria genome dna from the fecal samples was used to quantitate the fusobacterium, two butyrate-producing bacteria eubacterium rectal, faecalibacterium prausnitzii and total bacteria by real-time polymerase chain reaction. then the variation of the target bacteria among different groups were assayed using mann-whitney u test. results: the abundance of fusobacterium was significantly higher in colorectal cancer patients than that in healthy subjects  (p = 0.000) and colorectal adenomas patients (p = 0.013), and it was significantly higher in colorectal cancer patients than that in colorectal adenomas patients (p = 0.002). f. prausnitzii was significantly lower in colorectal adenomas patients compared to healthy subjects (p = 0.033). the total  bacteria count was significantly lower in the colorectal adenomas samples than that in the healthy samples (p = 0.002). there was no significantly difference of e. rectal between the three groups. conclusions: the shifts in the colonic bacterial population may potentially contribute to the development of colorectal  cancer.

TI  == monosodium l-glutamate and dietary fat differently modify the composition of the  intestinal microbiota in growing pigs.
AB  == background: the chinese have been undergone rapid transition to a high-fat diet-consuming lifestyle, while monosodium l-glutamate (msg) is widely used as a  daily food additive. it has been reported that fat alters the composition of intestinal microbiota. however, little information is available on the effects of oral msg on intestinal microbiota, and no study was done focusing on the interaction effect of fat and msg with respect to intestinal microbiota. the present study thus aimed to determine the effects of msg and/or fat on intestinal microbiota, and also to identify possible interactions between these two nutrients. methods: four iso-nitrogenous and iso-caloric diets were provided to growing pigs. the microbiota from jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon were analyzed. results: our results show that both msg and fat clearly increased the intestinal  microbiota diversity. msg and fat modified the composition of intestinal microbiota, particularly in the colon. both msg and fat promoted the colonization of microbes related to energy extraction in gastrointestinal tract via different  ways. msg promoted the colonization of faecalibacterium prausnitzii and roseburia, while fat increased the percentage of prevotella in colon and other intestinal segments. conclusion: our results will help to understand how individual or combined dietary changes modify the microbiota composition to prevent obesity.

TI  == increased gut microbiota diversity and abundance of faecalibacterium prausnitzii  and akkermansia after fasting: a pilot study.
AB  == background: an impaired gut microbiota has been reported as an important factor in the pathogenesis of obesity. weight reduction has already been mentioned to improve gut microbial subpopulations involved in inflammatory processes, though other subpopulations still need further investigation. thus, weight reduction in  the context of a fasting program together with a probiotic intervention may improve the abundance and diversity of gut microbiota. methods: in this pilot study, overweight people underwent a fasting program with laxative treatment for  1 week followed by a 6 week intervention with a probiotic formula. gut microbiota were analyzed on the basis of 16s rdna with a quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. additionally, a food frequency questionnaire with questions about nutritional behavior, lifestyle, and physical activity was administered before and after the intervention. results: we observed an increase in microbial diversity over the study period. no significant changes in abundance of total bacteria, or of bacteroidetes, prevotella, clostridium cluster xiva, or clostridium cluster iv were found, although faecalibacterium prausnitzii showed an increase over the study period. in addition, akkermanisa and bifidobacteria increased in abundance due to intervention. the inflammation-associated gut microbes enterobacteria and lactobacilli increased during the first week and then declined by the end of the intervention. two-thirds of the study participants harbored archaea. no significant improvements of eating habits were reported, although physical activity improved due to the intervention. conclusions: our results show that caloric restriction affects gut microbiota by proliferating mucin-degrading microbial subpopulations. an additional intervention with a probiotic formula increased probiotic-administered gut microbial populations.

TI  == red wine consumption is associated with fecal microbiota and malondialdehyde in a human population.
AB  == objectives: red wine intake has been associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease; its polyphenol content is the primary cause of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties attributed to this beverage. however, the way in which these activities are exerted is not yet clear, although some authors have proposed that intestinal microbiota could be implicated. methods: the association between red wine intake, inflammation, and oxidative stress parameters and fecal microbial populations has been explored in 38 adult volunteers. food intake was recorded by means of an annual food frequency questionnaire (ffq). energy, cholesterol, and ethanol intake were analyzed using  the nutrient food composition tables developed by centro de ensenanza superior de nutricion y dietetica (cesnid) and polyphenol intake was obtained from the phenol-explorer database. fecal levels of akkermansia, bacteroides, bifidobacterium, blautia coccoides group, clostridium leptum group, lactobacillus group, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. serum concentrations of c-reactive protein (crp), malondialdehyde (mda), total antioxidant capacity (tac), cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose were analyzed by standard methods. results: subjects with regular consumption of red wine (mean = 100 ml/day) had lower serum concentrations of mda and lower fecal levels of b. coccoides, c. leptum, bifidobacterium, and lactobacillus. a positive association between mda levels and b. coccoides and lactobacillus was also found. conclusion: regular consumption of red wine appears to be associated with a reduced serum lipoperoxidation in which  the intestinal microbiota may be involved.

TI  == review on microbiota and effectiveness of probiotics use in older.
AB  == the aim of the present systematic review is to summarize the existing knowledge about the human microbiota in the elderly and the effects of probiotics in elderly population. the elderly subjects, compared to adult population, show a reduction in the diversity of the microbiota, characterized by a large interindividual variability, with lower numbers of firmicutes, bifidobacteria, clostridium cluster xiv, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, blautia coccoides-eubacterium rectal and higher presence of enterobacteriaceae and bacteroidetes. these differences of the intestinal microbiota of the elderly may  not necessarily be caused by aging, but they could be associated with the decline of the general state of health with malnutrition and with increased need for medication, such as antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, situations that occur frequently in the elderly. differences have been demonstrated in the composition of the microbiota between healthy elderly subjects and hospitalized or institutionalized elderly subjects. these findings which further indicates that the living conditions, health status, nutrition and  drugs have a significant effect on the composition of the microbiota. according to the available knowledge, the use of probiotics is safe and could represent an  useful intervention to prevent or treat antibiotic-associated diarrhea, in addition to reducing the severity of symptoms, other than to help the management  of constipation.

TI  == high amount of dietary fiber not harmful but favorable for crohn disease.
AB  == current chronic diseases are a reflection of the westernized diet that features a decreased consumption of dietary fiber. indigestible dietary fiber is metabolized by gut bacteria, including faecalibacterium prausnitzii, to butyrate, which has a critical role in colonic homeostasis owing to a variety of functions. dietary fiber intake has been significantly inversely associated with the risk of chronic diseases. crohn disease (cd) is not an exception. however, even authors who reported the inverse association between dietary fiber and a risk of cd made no recommendation of dietary fiber intake to cd patients. some correspondence was against advocating high fiber intake in cd. we initiated a semivegetarian diet (svd), namely a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet, for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. our svd contains 32.4 g of dietary fiber in 2000 kcal. there was no untoward effect of the svd. the remission rate with combined infliximab and svd for newly diagnosed cd patients was 100%. maintenance of remission on svd without scheduled maintenance therapy with biologic drugs was 92% at 2 years. these excellent short- and long-term results can be explained partly by svd. the fecal  bacterial count of f prausnitzii in patients with cd is significantly lower than  in healthy controls. diet reviews recommend plant-based diets to treat and to prevent a variety of chronic diseases. svd belongs to plant-based diets that inevitably contain considerable amounts of dietary fiber. our clinical experience and available data provide a rationale to recommend a high fiber intake to treat  cd.

TI  == manipulating the gut microbiota to maintain health and treat disease.
AB  == background: the intestinal microbiota composition varies between healthy and diseased individuals for numerous diseases. although any cause or effect relationship between the alterations in the gut microbiota and disease is not always clear, targeting the intestinal microbiota might offer new possibilities for prevention and/or treatment of disease. objective: here we review some examples of manipulating the intestinal microbiota by prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbial transplants. results: prebiotics are best known for their ability to increase the number of bifidobacteria. however, specific prebiotics could potentially also stimulate other species they can also stimulate other species associated with health, like akkermansia muciniphila, ruminococcus bromii, the roseburia/enterococcus rectale group, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii. probiotics have beneficial health effects for different diseases and digestive symptoms. these effects can be due to the direct effect of the probiotic bacterium or its products itself, as well as effects of the probiotic on the resident microbiota. probiotics can influence the microbiota composition as well  as the activity of the resident microbiota. fecal microbial transplants are a drastic intervention in the gut microbiota, aiming for total replacement of one microbiota by another. with numerous successful studies related to antibiotic-associated diarrhea and clostridium difficile infection, the potential of fecal microbial transplants to treat other diseases like inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and metabolic and cardiovascular disorders is  under investigation. conclusions: improved knowledge on the specific role of gut  microbiota in prevention and treatment of disease will help more targeted manipulation of the intestinal microbiota. further studies are necessary to see the (long term) effects for health of these interventions.

TI  == gut microbiota composition correlates with changes in body fat content due to weight loss.
AB  == genetics, lifestyle, and dietary habits contribute to metabolic syndrome, but also an altered gut microbiota has been identified. based on this knowledge it is suggested that host bacterial composition tends to change in response to dietary  factors and weight loss. the aim of this study was to identify bacteria affecting host metabolism in obesity during weight loss and to correlate them with changes  of the body composition obtained from bioelectrical impedance analysis (bia). we  recruited obese individuals receiving a dietary intervention according dach (german, austrian, and swiss society of nutrition) reference values and guidelines for 'prevention and therapy of obesity' of dag e.v., ddg, dge e.v., and dgem e.v. over three months. faecal microbiota and bia measurements were conducted at three time points, before, during, and after the intervention. gut microbiota was analysed on the basis of 16s rdna with quantitative real time pcr. additionally, a food frequency questionnaire with questions to nutritional behaviour, lifestyle, and physical activity was administered before intervention. after weight reduction, obese individuals showed a significant increase of total  bacterial abundance. the ratio of firmicutes/bacteroidetes significantly decreased during intervention. lactobacilli significantly increased between the first and the second time point. these differences also correlated with differences in weight percentage. during the intervention period clostridium cluster iv increased significantly between the second and the third time point. in contrast clostridium cluster xiva showed a decreased abundance. the dominant butyrate producer, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, significantly increased as did the abundance of the butyryl-coa: acetate coa-transferase gene. archaea and akkermansia were significantly more prevalent after weight reduction. our results show a clear difference in the gut bacterial composition before and after dietary intervention with a rapid change in gut microbial composition after a few weeks,  but also indicate that a major shift requires long term dietary treatment.

AB  == the goal of our study was to isolate and characterize faecalibacterium prausnitzii from fecal samples of healthy calves and piglets, in order to develop a novel probiotic for livestock animals. we identified 203 isolates of faecalibacterium sp., which were clustered in 40 genetically distinct groups. one representative isolate from each cluster was selected for further characterization. the concentrations of the short chain fatty acids (scfa) acetate, butyrate, propionate and isobutyrate in the culture media were measured  by gas chromatography. we observed reduction in the concentration of acetate followed by concomitant increase in the concentration of butyrate, suggesting that the isolates were consuming acetate present in the media and producing butyrate. butyrate production correlated positively with bacterial growth. since  butyrate has many benefits to the colonic epithelial cells, the selection of strains that produce higher amounts of butyrate is extremely important for the development of this potential probiotic. the effect of ph and concentration of bile salts on bacterial growth was also evaluated in order to mimic the conditions encountered by f. prausnitzii in vivo. the optimal ph for growth ranged between 5.5 and 6.7, while most isolates were inhibited by of the lowest concentration of bile salts tested (0.1%). antimicrobial resistance profile showed that most isolates of faecalibacterium sp. were resistant against ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. more than 50% of the isolates were resistant to tetracycline, amikacin, cefepime and cefoxitin. a total of 19 different combinations of multidrug resistance were observed among the isolates.  our results provide new insights into the cultural and physiological characteristics of faecalibacterium prausnitzii illustrating large variability in short chain fatty acid production, in vitro growth, sensitivity to bile salts, and antibiotic resistance and suggesting that future probiotic candidates should  be carefully studied before elected for in vivo studies.

TI  == impact of the gut microbiota on rodent models of human disease.
AB  == traditionally bacteria have been considered as either pathogens, commensals or symbionts. the mammal gut harbors 10(14) organisms dispersed on approximately 1000 different species. today, diagnostics, in contrast to previous cultivation techniques, allow the identification of close to 100% of bacterial species. this  has revealed that a range of animal models within different research areas, such  as diabetes, obesity, cancer, allergy, behavior and colitis, are affected by their gut microbiota. correlation studies may for some diseases show correlation  between gut microbiota composition and disease parameters higher than 70%. some disease phenotypes may be transferred when recolonizing germ free mice. the mechanistic aspects are not clear, but some examples on how gut bacteria stimulate receptors, metabolism, and immune responses are discussed. a more deeper understanding of the impact of microbiota has its origin in the overall composition of the microbiota and in some newly recognized species, such as akkermansia muciniphila, segmented filamentous bacteria and faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which seem to have an impact on more or less severe disease in specific models. thus, the impact of the microbiota on animal models is of a magnitude that cannot be ignored in future research. therefore, either models with specific microbiota must be developed, or the microbiota must be characterized in individual studies and incorporated into data evaluation.

TI  == understanding how commensal obligate anaerobic bacteria regulate immune functions in the large intestine.
AB  == the human gastrointestinal tract is colonised by trillions of commensal bacteria, most of which are obligate anaerobes residing in the large intestine. appropriate bacterial colonisation is generally known to be critical for human health. in particular, the development and function of the immune system depends on microbial colonisation, and a regulated cross-talk between commensal bacteria, intestinal epithelial cells and immune cells is required to maintain mucosal immune homeostasis. this homeostasis is disturbed in various inflammatory disorders, such as inflammatory bowel diseases. several in vitro and in vivo studies indicate a role for faecalibacterium prausnitzii, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides fragilis, akkermansia muciniphila and segmented filamentous bacteria in maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis. these obligate anaerobes are abundant in the healthy intestine but reduced in several inflammatory diseases, suggesting an association with protective effects on human health. however, knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the effects of obligate anaerobic intestinal bacteria remains limited, in part due to the difficulty of co-culturing obligate anaerobes together with oxygen-requiring human epithelial cells. by using novel dual-environment co-culture models, it will be possible to  investigate the effects of the unstudied majority of intestinal microorganisms on the human epithelia. this knowledge will provide opportunities for improving human health and reducing the risk of inflammatory diseases.

TI  == lactobacillus rhamnosus cncm i-3690 and the commensal bacterium faecalibacterium  prausnitzii a2-165 exhibit similar protective effects to induced barrier hyper-permeability in mice.
AB  == impaired gut barrier function has been reported in a wide range of diseases and syndromes and in some functional gastrointestinal disorders. in addition, there is increasing evidence that suggests the gut microbiota tightly regulates gut barrier function and recent studies demonstrate that probiotic bacteria can enhance barrier integrity. here, we aimed to investigate the effects of lactobacillus rhamnosus cncm i-3690 on intestinal barrier function. in vitro results using a caco-2 monolayer cells stimulated with tnf-alpha confirmed the anti-inflammatory nature of the strain cncm i-3690 and pointed out a putative role for the protection of the epithelial function. next, we tested the protective effects of l. rhamnosus cncm i-3690 in a mouse model of increased colonic permeability. most importantly, we compared its performance to that of the well-known beneficial human commensal bacterium faecalibacterium prauznitzii  a2-165. increased colonic permeability was normalized by both strains to a similar degree. modulation of apical tight junction proteins expression was then  analyzed to decipher the mechanism underlying this effect. we showed that cncm i-3690 partially restored the function of the intestinal barrier and increased the levels of tight junction proteins occludin and e-cadherin. the results indicate l. rhamnosus cncm i-3690 is as effective as the commensal anti-inflammatory bacterium f. prausnitzii to treat functional barrier abnormalities.

TI  == essential oils have different effects on human pathogenic and commensal bacteria  in mixed faecal fermentations compared with pure cultures.
AB  == a static batch culture system inoculated with human faeces was used to determine  the influence of essential oil compounds (eocs) on mixed faecal microbiota. bacteria were quantified using quantitative pcr of 16s rrna genes. incubation for 24 h of diluted faeces from six individuals caused enrichment of bifidobacterium  spp., but proportions of other major groups were unaffected. thymol and geraniol  at 500 p.p.m. suppressed total bacteria, resulting in minimal fermentation. thymol at 100 p.p.m. had no effect, nor did eugenol or nerolidol at 100 or 500 p.p.m. except for a slight suppression of eubacterium hallii. methyl isoeugenol at 100 or 500 p.p.m. suppressed the growth of total bacteria, accompanied by a large fall in the molar proportion of propionate formed. the relative abundance of faecalibacterium prausnitzii was unaffected except with thymol at 500 p.p.m. the ability of eocs to control numbers of the pathogen clostridium difficile was  investigated in a separate experiment, in which the faecal suspensions were amended by the addition of pure culture of c. difficile. numbers of c. difficile  were suppressed by thymol and methyl isoeugenol at 500 p.p.m. and to a lesser extent at 100 p.p.m. eugenol and geraniol gave rather similar suppression of c. difficile numbers at both 100 and 500 p.p.m. nerolidol had no significant effect. it was concluded from these and previous pure-culture experiments that thymol and geraniol at around 100 p.p.m. could be effective in suppressing pathogens in the  small intestine, with no concern for beneficial commensal colonic bacteria in the distal gut.

TI  == altered microbiota associated with abnormal humoral immune responses to commensal organisms in enthesitis-related arthritis.
AB  == introduction: prior studies have established altered microbiota and immunologic reactivity to enteric commensal organisms in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). since intestinal inflammation is present in a subset of patients with both pediatric and adult spondyloarthritis (spa), we hypothesized that spa patients may also have altered microbiota and immune responsiveness to enteric organisms.  methods: stool and blood specimens were collected from children with enthesitis-related arthritis (era) and non-inflammatory controls. dna purified from stool was subject to pcr amplification and sequencing of the variable iv region from the 16s rdna gene. iga and igg enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisas) were performed on select species of bacteria in most subjects. results:  twenty-five children with era and 13 controls were included. the era patients had less faecalibacterium prausnitzii (3.8% versus 10%, p = 0.008) and lachnospiraceae family (12 versus 7.0%, p = 0.020), a statistically significant increase in bifidobacterium (1.8% versus 0%, p = 0.032) and a non-statistically significant increase in bacteroides (21% versus 11%, p = 0.150). akkermansia muciniphila was abundant (>2%) in 7/27 era patients but none of the controls (p = 0.072.) cluster analysis revealed two clusters of era patients: cluster one (n =  8) was characterized by high levels of bacteroides genus, while a second (n = 15) cluster had similar levels as the controls. seven of 17 (41%) of the era subjects in cluster 2 compared to 0/8 of the subjects in cluster 1 had abundant akkermansia muciniphila (p = 0.057). serum iga and igg antibody levels against f. prausnitzii and b. fragilis were similar between patients and controls, whereas the two groups showed divergent responses when the fecal relative abundances of f. prausnitzii and bacteroides were compared individually against iga antibody levels recognizing f. prausnitzii and b. fragilis, respectively. conclusion: the  abundance of f. prausnitzii in the stool among patients with era is reduced compared to controls, and bacteroides and a. muciniphila are identified as associative agents in subsets of era patients. differences in the humoral responses to these bacteria may contribute to disease.

TI  == enteric microbiota leads to new therapeutic strategies for ulcerative colitis.
AB  == ulcerative colitis (uc) is a leading form of inflammatory bowel disease that involves chronic relapsing or progressive inflammation. as a significant proportion of uc patients treated with conventional therapies do not achieve remission, there is a pressing need for the development of more effective therapies. the human gut contains a large, diverse, and dynamic population of microorganisms, collectively referred to as the enteric microbiota. there is a symbiotic relationship between the human host and the enteric microbiota, which provides nutrition, protection against pathogenic organisms, and promotes immune  homeostasis. an imbalance of the normal enteric microbiota composition (termed dysbiosis) underlies the pathogenesis of uc. a reduction of enteric microbiota diversity has been observed in uc patients, mainly affecting the butyrate-producing bacteria, such as faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which can repress pro-inflammatory cytokines. many studies have shown that enteric microbiota plays an important role in anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory activities, which can benefit uc patients. therefore, manipulation of the dysbiosis is an attractive approach for uc therapy. various therapies targeting a restoration of the enteric microbiota have shown efficacy in treating patients with active and chronic forms of uc. such therapies include fecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics, helminth therapy, and dietary polyphenols, all of which can alter the abundance and composition of the  enteric microbiota. although there have been many large, randomized controlled clinical trials assessing these treatments, the effectiveness and safety of these bacteria-driven therapies need further evaluation. this review focuses on the important role that the enteric microbiota plays in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and discusses new therapeutic strategies targeting the enteric microbiota for uc.

TI  == blastocystis is associated with decrease of fecal microbiota protective bacteria: comparative analysis between patients with irritable bowel syndrome and control subjects.
AB  == blastocystis is a protistan parasite living in the digestive tract of many animals, including humans. this highly prevalent intestinal parasite is suspected to be linked to irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), a chronic functional bowel disorder. here, we first compared the prevalence of blastocystis among 56 ibs patients (40 ibs with constipation (ibs-c), 9 ibs with diarrhea (ibs-d), 4 mixed  ibs (ibs-m) and 3 unsubtyped ibs (ibs-u) according to the rome iii criteria) and  56 control (i.e. without any diagnosed chronic or acute gastrointestinal disorder) subjects. the highest prevalence of blastocystis spp. was observed in the ibs group, but was only statistically significant in men (36.8% in the ibs group versus 4.8% in the control group). we then conducted a meta-analysis including epidemiological studies attempting to determine whether blastocystis carriage could be linked to ibs, and highlighted that ibs patients had a relative risk of 2.34 to be infected by blastocystis when compared to non-ibs subjects. we also looked for dientamoeba fragilis, which is often associated with ibs, and identified this parasite only in some ibs patients (n = 6/56). several studies provided evidence for a major role of the gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of ibs. thus, we investigated the possible impact of blastocystis carriage on the enteric bacterial community through quantification of 8 major bacterial groups from the enteric flora. our data indicated that men with ibs-c had a significant  decrease in bifidobacterium sp. when infected by blastocystis. interestingly, in  control subjects (i.e. without any gastrointestinal disorder) positive for blastocystis, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which is known for its anti-inflammatory properties, was significantly decreased in men. our results support the hypothesis that blastocystis might be linked to the pathophysiology of ibs-c and intestinal flora imbalance.

TI  == in vitro fermentation of lactulose by human gut bacteria.
AB  == lactulose has been known as a prebiotic that can selectively stimulate the growth of beneficial bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. recent studies have indicated that streptococcus mutans, clostridium perfringens, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii are also able to utilize lactulose. however, the previous studies mainly focused  on the utilization of lactulose by individual strains, and few studies were designed to identify the species that could utilize lactulose among gut microbiota. this study aimed to identify lactulose-metabolizing bacteria in the human gut, using in silico and traditional culture methods. the prediction results suggested that genes for the transporters and glycosidases of lactulose are well distributed in the genomes of 222 of 453 strains of gastrointestinal-tract bacteria. the screening assays identified 35 species with  the ability to utilize lactulose, of which cronobacter sakazakii, enterococcus faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas putida were reported for the first time to be capable of utilizing lactulose. in addition, significant correlations between lactulose and galactooligosaccharide metabolism were found.  thus, more attention should be paid to bacteria besides bifidobacteria and lactobacilli to further investigate the relationship between functional oligosaccharides and gut bacteria.

TI  == diets high in resistant starch and arabinoxylan modulate digestion processes and  scfa pool size in the large intestine and faecal microbial composition in pigs.
AB  == the effects of a high level of dietary fibre (df) either as arabinoxylan (ax) or  resistant starch (rs) on digestion processes, scfa concentration and pool size in various intestinal segments and on the microbial composition in the faeces were studied in a model experiment with pigs. a total of thirty female pigs (body weight 63.1 (sem 4.4) kg) were fed a low-df, high-fat western-style control diet  (wsd), an ax-rich diet (axd) or a rs-rich diet (rsd) for 3 weeks. diet significantly affected the digestibility of dm, protein, fat, nsp and nsp components, and the arabinose:xylose ratio, as well as the disappearance of nsp and ax in the large intestine. rs was mainly digested in the caecum. ax was digested at a slower rate than rs. the digesta from axd-fed pigs passed from the  ileum to the distal colon more than twice as fast as those from wsd-fed pigs, with those from rsd-fed pigs being intermediate (p< 0.001). axd feeding resulted  in a higher number of faecalibacterium prausnitzii, roseburia intestinalis, blautia coccoides-eubacterium rectale, bifidobacterium spp. and lactobacillus spp. in the faeces sampled at week 3 of the experimental period (p< 0.05). in the caecum, proximal and mid colon, axd feeding resulted in a 3- to 5-fold higher pool size of butyrate compared with wsd feeding, with the rsd being intermediate  (p <0.001). in conclusion, the rsd and axd differently affected digestion processes compared with the wsd, and the axd most efficiently shifted the microbial composition towards butyrogenic species in the faeces and increased the large-intestinal butyrate pool size.

TI  == intestinal microbial variation may predict early acute rejection after liver transplantation in rats.
AB  == background: acute rejection (ar) remains a life-threatening complication after orthotopic liver transplantation (olt) and there are few available diagnostic biomarkers clinically for ar. this study aims to identify intestinal microbial profile and explore potential application of microbial profile as a biomarker for ar after olt. methods: the olt models in rats were established. hepatic graft histology, ultrastructure, function, and intestinal barrier function were tested. ileocecal contents were collected for intestinal microbial analysis. results: hepatic graft suffered from the ischemia-reperfusion (i/r) injury on day 1, initial ar on day 3, and severe ar on day 7 after olt. real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction results showed that genus faecalibacterium prausnitzii  and lactobacillus were decreased, whereas clostridium bolteae was increased during ar. notably, cluster analysis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) profiles showed the 7ar and 3ar groups clustered together with 73.4% similarity, suggesting that intestinal microbiota was more sensitive than hepatic function in responding to ar. microbial diversity and species richness were decreased during ar. phylogenetic tree analysis showed that most of the decreased key bacteria belonged to phylum firmicutes, whereas increased key bacteria belonged to phylum bacteroidetes. moreover, intestinal microvilli loss and tight  junction damage were noted, and intestinal barrier dysfunction during ar presented a decrease of fecal secretory immunoglobulin a (siga) and increase of blood bacteremia, endotoxin, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. conclusion: we dynamically detail intestinal microbial characterization and find a high sensitivity of microbial change during ar after olt, suggesting that intestinal microbial variation may predict ar in early phase and become an assistant therapeutic target to improve rejection after olt.

TI  == structural modulation of gut microbiota during alleviation of type 2 diabetes with a chinese herbal formula.
AB  == the gut microbiota is hypothesized to have a critical role in metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes (t2d). a traditional chinese herbal formula, gegen qinlian decoction (gqd), can alleviate t2d. to find out whether gqd modulates the composition of the gut microbiota during t2d treatment, 187 t2d patients were randomly allocated to receive high (hd, n=44), moderate (md, n=52), low dose gqd  (ld, n=50) or the placebo (n=41) for 12 weeks in a double-blinded trial. patients who received the hd or md demonstrated significant reductions in adjusted mean changes from baseline of fasting blood glucose (fbg) and glycated hemoglobin (hba1c) compared with the placebo and ld groups. pyrosequencing of the v3 regions of 16s rrna genes revealed a dose-dependent deviation of gut microbiota in response to gqd treatment. this deviation occurred before significant improvement of t2d symptoms was observed. redundancy analysis identified 47 gqd-enriched species level phylotypes, 17 of which were negatively correlated with fbg and 9 with hba1c. real-time quantitative pcr confirmed that gqd significantly enriched  faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which was negatively correlated with fbg, hba1c and 2-h postprandial blood glucose levels and positively correlated with homeostasis  model assessment of beta-cell function. therefore, these data indicate that structural changes of gut microbiota are induced by chinese herbal formula gqd. specifically, gqd treatment may enrich the amounts of beneficial bacteria, such as faecalibacterium spp. in conclusion, changes in the gut microbiota are associated with the anti-diabetic effects of gqd.

TI  == faecalibacterium prausnitzii inhibits interleukin-17 to ameliorate colorectal colitis in rats.
AB  == background and aims: it has been shown that faecalibacterium prausnitzii (f. prausnitzii), one of the dominant intestinal bacterial flora, may protect colonic mucosa against the development of inflammation and subsequent inflammatory bowel  disease (ibd), with the underlying mechanisms being unclear. methods: the impacts of f. prausnitzii and its metabolites on il-23/th17/il-17 pathway markers were determined in human monocytes and a rat model of colitis induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid. f. prausnitzii and its culture medium (containing complete metabolites) were used to treat the rats in vivo, as well as rat splenocytes and human monocytes in vitro. inflammatory cytokines were measured in colon tissue, plasma and cell culture medium. results: the culture supernatant of f. prausnitzii increased plasma anti-th17 cytokines (il-10 and il-12)and suppressed il-17 levels in both plasma and colonic mucosa, with ameliorated colonic colitis lesions. this inhibition of il-17 release has also been observed in both rat splenocytes and human venous monocytes in vitro. the culture supernatant of f. prausnitzii also suppressed th17 cell differentiation induced by cytokines (tgf-ss and il-6) and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (bmdcs) in vitro. the metabolites of f. prausnitzii in the culture supernatant exert a stronger anti-inflammatory effect than the bacterium itself. f. prausnitzii protected the colon mucosa against the development of ibd by its metabolites, suggesting a promising potential for the use of f. prausnitzii and its metabolic products in the treatment of ibd.

TI  == dietary supplementation with soybean oligosaccharides increases short-chain fatty acids but decreases protein-derived catabolites in the intestinal luminal content of weaned huanjiang mini-piglets.
AB  == the improvement of gut health and function with prebiotic supplements after weaning is an active area of research in pig nutrition. the present study was conducted to test the working hypothesis that medium-term dietary supplementation with soybean oligosaccharides (sbos) can affect the gut ecosystem in terms of microbiota composition, luminal bacterial short-chain fatty acid and ammonia concentrations, and intestinal expression of genes related to intestinal immunity and barrier function. ten huanjiang mini-piglets, weaned at 21 days of age, were  randomly assigned to 2 groups. each group received a standard diet containing either dietary supplementation with 0.5% corn starch (control group) or 0.5% sbos (experimental group). the results showed that dietary supplementation with sbos increased the diversity of intestinal microflora and elevated (p < .05) the numbers of some presumably beneficial intestinal bacteria (e.g., bifidobacterium  sp, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, fusobacterium prausnitzii, and roseburia). soybean oligosaccharide supplementation also increased the concentration of short-chain fatty acid in the intestinal lumen, and it reduced (p < .05) the numbers of bacteria with pathogenic potential (e.g., escherichia coli, clostridium, and streptococcus) and the concentration of several protein-derived  catabolites (e.g., isobutyrate, isovalerate, and ammonia). in addition, sbos supplementation increased (p < .05) expression of zonula occludens 1 messenger rna, and it decreased (p < .05) expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1beta, and interleukin 8 messenger rna in the ileum and colon. these  findings suggest that sbos supplementation modifies the intestinal ecosystem in weaned huanjiang mini-piglets and has potentially beneficial effects on the gut.

TI  == live faecalibacterium prausnitzii in an apical anaerobic model of the intestinal  epithelial barrier.
AB  == faecalibacterium prausnitzii, an abundant member of the human commensal microbiota, has been proposed to have a protective role in the intestine. however, it is an obligate anaerobe, difficult to co-culture in viable form with  oxygen-requiring intestinal cells. to overcome this limitation, a unique apical anaerobic model of the intestinal barrier, which enabled co-culture of live obligate anaerobes with the human intestinal cell line caco-2, was developed. caco-2 cells remained viable and maintained an intact barrier for at least 12 h,  consistent with gene expression data, which suggested caco-2 cells had adapted to survive in an oxygen-reduced atmosphere. live f. prausnitzii cells, but not ultraviolet (uv)-killed f. prausnitzii, increased the permeability of mannitol across the epithelial barrier. gene expression analysis showed inflammatory mediators to be expressed at lower amounts in caco-2 cells exposed to live f. prausnitzii than uv-killed f. prausnitzii, this, consistent with previous reports, implies that live f. prausnitzii produces an anti-inflammatory compound  in the culture supernatant, demonstrating the value of a physiologically relevant co-culture system that allows obligate anaerobic bacteria to remain viable.

TI  == potential of novel dextran oligosaccharides as prebiotics for obesity management  through in vitro experimentation.
AB  == the energy-salvaging capacity of the gut microbiota from dietary ingredients has  been proposed as a contributing factor for the development of obesity. this knowledge generated interest in the use of non-digestible dietary ingredients such as prebiotics to manipulate host energy homeostasis. in the present study, the in vitro response of obese human faecal microbiota to novel oligosaccharides  was investigated. dextrans of various molecular weights and degrees of branching  were fermented with the faecal microbiota of healthy obese adults in ph-controlled batch cultures. changes in bacterial populations were monitored using fluorescent in situ hybridisation and scfa concentrations were analysed by  hplc. the rate of gas production and total volume of gas produced were also determined. in general, the novel dextrans and inulin increased the counts of bifidobacteria. some of the dextrans were able to alter the composition of the obese human microbiota by increasing the counts of bacteroides-prevotella and decreasing those of faecalibacterium prausnitzii and ruminococcus bromii/r. flavefaciens. considerable increases in scfa concentrations were observed in response to all substrates. gas production rates were similar during the fermentation of all dextrans, but significantly lower than those during the fermentation of inulin. lower total gas production and shorter time to attain maximal gas production were observed during the fermentation of the linear 1 kda  dextran than during the fermentation of the other dextrans. the efficacy of bifidobacteria to ferment dextrans relied on the molecular weight and not on the  degree of branching. in conclusion, there are no differences in the profiles between the obese and lean human faecal fermentations of dextrans.

TI  == differential modulation by akkermansia muciniphila and faecalibacterium prausnitzii of host peripheral lipid metabolism and histone acetylation in mouse  gut organoids.
AB  == the gut microbiota is essential for numerous aspects of human health. however, the underlying mechanisms of many host-microbiota interactions remain unclear. the aim of this study was to characterize effects of the microbiota on host epithelium using a novel ex vivo model based on mouse ileal organoids. we have explored the transcriptional response of organoids upon exposure to short-chain fatty acids (scfas) and products generated by two abundant microbiota constituents, akkermansia muciniphila and faecalibacterium prausnitzii. we observed that a. muciniphila metabolites affect various transcription factors and genes involved in cellular lipid metabolism and growth, supporting previous in vivo findings. contrastingly, f. prausnitzii products exerted only weak effects on host transcription. additionally, a. muciniphila and its metabolite propionate modulated expression of fiaf, gpr43, histone deacetylases (hdacs), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (ppargamma), important regulators of transcription factor regulation, cell cycle control, lipolysis, and satiety. this work illustrates that specific bacteria and their metabolites differentially modulate epithelial transcription in mouse organoids. we demonstrate that intestinal organoids provide a novel and powerful ex vivo model for host-microbiome interaction studies. importance: we investigated the influence of the gut microbiota and microbially produced short-chain fatty acids (scfas) on gut functioning. many commensal bacteria in the gut produce scfas, particularly butyrate, acetate, and propionate, which have been demonstrated to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal disorders. organoids-small crypt-villus structures grown from ileal intestinal stem cells-were exposed to scfas and two specific gut bacteria. akkermansia muciniphila, found in the intestinal mucus, was recently shown to have a favorable effect on the disrupted metabolism associated with obesity. faecalibacterium prausnitzii is a commensal gut bacterium, the absence of which may be associated with crohn's disease. we showed that in our model, a.  muciniphila induces stronger effects on the host than f. prausnitzii. we observed that a. muciniphila and propionate affect the expression of genes involved in host lipid metabolism and epigenetic activation or silencing of gene expression.  we demonstrated that organoids provide a powerful tool for host-microbe interaction studies.

AB  == background: gastrointestinal mucositis is defined as inflammation and/or ulcers of the gastrointestinal tract occurring as a complication of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and affects about 50% of all cancer patients. aim: to assess the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal mucositis and  the potential for manipulations of the microbiota to prevent and to treat mucositis. methods: search of the literature published in english using medline,  scopus and the cochrane library, with main search terms 'intestinal microbiota',  'bacteremia', 'mucositis', 'chemotherapy-induced diarrhoea', 'chemotherapy-induced mucositis', 'radiotherapy-induced mucositis'. results: the  gut microbiota plays a major role in the maintenance of intestinal homoeostasis and integrity. patients receiving cytotoxic and radiation therapy exhibit marked  changes in intestinal microbiota, with most frequently, decrease in bifidobacterium, clostridium cluster xiva, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and increase in enterobacteriaceae and bacteroides. these modifications may contribute to the development of mucositis, particularly diarrhoea and bacteraemia. the prevention of cancer therapy-induced mucositis by probiotics has been investigated in randomised clinical trials with some promising results. three of six trials reported a significantly decreased incidence of diarrhoea. one trial reported a decrease in infectious complications. conclusions: the gut microbiota may play a major role in the pathogenesis of mucositis through the modification of intestinal barrier function, innate immunity and intestinal repair mechanisms. better knowledge of these effects may lead to new therapeutic  approaches and to the identification of predictive markers of mucositis.

AB  == the human gut microbiota plays a central role in human well-being and disease. in this study, we present an integrated, iterative approach of computational modeling, in vitro experiments, metabolomics, and genomic analysis to accelerate  the identification of metabolic capabilities for poorly characterized (anaerobic) microorganisms. we demonstrate this approach for the beneficial human gut microbe faecalibacterium prausnitzii strain a2-165. we generated an automated draft reconstruction, which we curated against the limited biochemical data. this reconstruction modeling was used to develop in silico and in vitro a chemically defined medium (cdm), which was validated experimentally. subsequent metabolomic  analysis of the spent medium for growth on cdm was performed. we refined our metabolic reconstruction according to in vitro observed metabolite consumption and secretion and propose improvements to the current genome annotation of f. prausnitzii a2-165. we then used the reconstruction to systematically characterize its metabolic properties. novel carbon source utilization capabilities and inabilities were predicted based on metabolic modeling and validated experimentally. this study resulted in a functional metabolic map of f. prausnitzii, which is available for further applications. the presented workflow  can be readily extended to other poorly characterized and uncharacterized organisms to yield novel biochemical insights about the target organism.

TI  == high-protein diet modifies colonic microbiota and luminal environment but not colonocyte metabolism in the rat model: the increased luminal bulk connection.
AB  == high-protein diets are used for body weight reduction, but consequences on the large intestine ecosystem are poorly known. here, rats were fed for 15 days with  either a normoproteic diet (np, 14% protein) or a hyperproteic-hypoglucidic isocaloric diet (hp, 53% protein). cecum and colon were recovered for analysis. short- and branched-chain fatty acids, as well as lactate, succinate, formate, and ethanol contents, were markedly increased in the colonic luminal contents of  hp rats (p < 0.05 or less) but to a lower extent in the cecal luminal content. this was associated with reduced concentrations of the clostridium coccoides and  c. leptum groups and faecalibacterium prausnitzii in both the cecum and colon (p  < 0.05 or less). in addition, the microbiota diversity was found to be higher in  the cecum of hp rats but was lower in the colon compared with np rats. in hp rats, the colonic and cecal luminal content weights were markedly higher than in  np rats (p < 0.001), resulting in similar butyrate, acetate, and propionate concentrations. accordingly, the expression of monocarboxylate transporter 1 and  sodium monocarboxylate transporter 1 (which is increased by higher butyrate concentration) as well as the colonocyte capacity for butyrate oxidation were not modified by the hp diet, whereas the amount of butyrate in feces was increased (p < 0.01). it is concluded that an increased bulk in the large intestine content following hp diet consumption allows maintenance in the luminal butyrate concentration and thus its metabolism in colonocytes despite modified microbiota  composition and increased substrate availability.

TI  == exploring the influence of the gut microbiota and probiotics on health: a symposium report.
AB  == the present report describes the presentations delivered at the 7th international yakult symposium, 'the intestinal microbiota and probiotics: exploiting their influence on health', in london on 22-23 april 2013. the following two themes associated with health risks were covered: (1) the impact of age and diet on the  gut microbiota and (2) the gut microbiota's interaction with the host. the strong influence of the maternal gut microbiota on neonatal colonisation was reported, as well as rapid changes in the gut microbiome of older people who move from community living to residential care. the effects of dietary changes on gut metabolism were described and the potential influence of inter-individual microbiota differences was noted, in particular the presence/absence of keystone  species involved in butyrate metabolism. several speakers highlighted the association between certain metabolic disorders and imbalanced or less diverse microbiota. data from metagenomic analyses and novel techniques (including an ex  vivo human mucosa model) provided new insights into the microbiota's influence on coeliac, obesity-related and inflammatory diseases, as well as the potential of probiotics. akkermansia muciniphila and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were suggested as targets for intervention. host-microbiota interactions were explored in the context of gut barrier function, pathogenic bacteria recognition, and the  ability of the immune system to induce either tolerogenic or inflammatory responses. there was speculation that the gut microbiota should be considered a separate organ, and whether analysis of an individual's microbiota could be useful in identifying their disease risk and/or therapy; however, more research is needed into specific diseases, different population groups and microbial interventions including probiotics.

TI  == microbiota and diabetes: an evolving relationship.
AB  == the gut microbiota affects numerous biological functions throughout the body and  its characterisation has become a major research area in biomedicine. recent studies have suggested that gut bacteria play a fundamental role in diseases such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. data are accumulating in animal  models and humans suggesting that obesity and type 2 diabetes (t2d) are associated with a profound dysbiosis. first human metagenome-wide association studies demonstrated highly significant correlations of specific intestinal bacteria, certain bacterial genes and respective metabolic pathways with t2d. importantly, especially butyrate-producing bacteria such as roseburia intestinalis and faecalibacterium prausnitzii concentrations were lower in t2d subjects. this supports the increasing evidence, that butyrate and other short-chain fatty acids are able to exert profound immunometabolic effects. endotoxaemia, most likely gut-derived has also been observed in patients with metabolic syndrome and t2d and might play a key role in metabolic inflammation. a further hint towards an association between microbiota and t2d has been derived from studies in pregnancy showing that major gut microbial shifts occurring during pregnancy affect host metabolism. interestingly, certain antidiabetic drugs such as metformin also interfere with the intestinal microbiota. specific members of the microbiota such as akkermansia muciniphila might be decreased in diabetes and when administered to murines exerted antidiabetic effects. therefore, as a 'gut signature' becomes more evident in t2d, a better understanding of the role of the microbiota in diabetes might provide new aspects regarding its pathophysiological relevance and pave the way for new therapeutic principles.

TI  == association between faecalibacterium prausnitzii reduction and inflammatory bowel disease: a meta-analysis and systematic review of the literature.
AB  == background. laboratory data suggests a reduction of faecalibacterium prausnitzii  (f. prausnitzii) is confirmed both in fecal samples in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) patients. numerous observational studies have suspected dysbiosis, an imbalance between protective and harmful bacteria to be relevant to the etiology  and pathogenesis of ibd. methods. medline, embase, pubmed, and others. were searched by 2 independent reviewers. of 48 abstracts reviewed, 11 studies met our inclusion criteria (subject n = 1180). meta-analysis was performed with review manager 5.2. results. the bacterial count of f. prausnitzii in ibd patients was significantly lower (6.7888 +/- 1.8875) log10 cfu/g feces than healthy controls (7.5791 +/- 1.5812) log10 cfu/g feces; p < 0.0001. the standardization mean difference of f. prausnitzii in ibd patients was -0.94 (95% confidence interval [ci]: -1.07--0.80). subgroup analyses revealed a trend toward a greater effect for cd (smd: -1.13, 95% ci: -1.32--0.94) when compared to uc (smd: -0.78, 95% ci: -0.97--0.60). conclusions. the abundance of f. prausnitzii was decreased in ibd patients compared with healthy controls. furthermore, the reduction of f. prausnitzii and misbalance of the intestinal microbiota are particularly higher in cd patients with ileal involvement.

TI  == antioxidants keep the potentially probiotic but highly oxygen-sensitive human gut bacterium faecalibacterium prausnitzii alive at ambient air.
AB  == the beneficial human gut microbe faecalibacterium prausnitzii is a 'probiotic of  the future' since it produces high amounts of butyrate and anti-inflammatory compounds. however, this bacterium is highly oxygen-senstive, making it notoriously difficult to cultivate and preserve. this has so far precluded its clinical application in the treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. the present studies were therefore aimed at developing a strategy to keep f. prausnitzii alive at ambient air. our previous research showed that f. prausnitzii can survive in moderately oxygenized environments like the gut mucosa by transfer of electrons to oxygen. for this purpose, the bacterium exploits extracellular antioxidants, such as riboflavin and cysteine, that are abundantly  present in the gut. we therefore tested to what extent these antioxidants can sustain the viability of f. prausnitzii at ambient air. the present results show  that cysteine can facilitate the survival of f. prausnitzii upon exposure to air, and that this effect is significantly enhanced the by addition of riboflavin and  the cryoprotectant inulin. the highly oxygen-sensitive gut bacterium f. prausnitzii can be kept alive at ambient air for 24 h when formulated with the antioxidants cysteine and riboflavin plus the cryoprotectant inulin. improved formulations were obtained by addition of the bulking agents corn starch and wheat bran. our present findings pave the way towards the biomedical exploitation of f. prausnitzii in redox-based therapeutics for treatment of dysbiosis-related  inflammatory disorders of the human gut.

TI  == alterations in the intestinal microbiome (dysbiosis) as a predictor of relapse after infliximab withdrawal in crohn's disease.
AB  == background: crohn's disease (cd)-associated dysbiosis could predispose patients to relapse. gut microbiota composition of patients from the prospective cohort study designed to identify predictive factors of clinical relapse after infliximab discontinuation (stori study) was investigated to determine the impact of dysbiosis in cd relapse. methods: fecal samples from 33 patients with cd in this cohort were collected at baseline, 2 months, 6 months, and at the end of the follow-up period (19 relapsers and 14 nonrelapsers). healthy volunteers subjects  (n = 29) were used as a control group. the fecal microbiota composition was assessed using quantitative pcr, and comparisons between the patient groups were  made at different time points using the wilcoxon test. the analysis of the time-to-relapse was performed according to the baseline median level of each bacterial signal. results: dysbiosis was observed in patients with cd compared with healthy subjects, and it was characterized by low mean counts of firmicutes  (clostridium coccoides [p = 0.0003], c. leptum [p < 0.0001], and faecalibacterium prausnitzii [p = 0.003]). lower rates of firmicutes were seen in relapsers compared with nonrelapsers. moreover, a low rate of f. prausnitzii (p = 0.014) and a low rate of bacteroides (p = 0.030) predicted relapse independently from high c reactive protein level (p = 0.0001). conclusions: in this work, we report  that cd-associated dysbiosis, characterized by a decrease in firmicutes, correlates with the time-to-relapse after infliximab withdrawal. a deficit in some bacterial groups or species, such as f. prausnitzii, may represent a predictive factor for relapse. restoring normobiosis in cd could be a new goal for optimal cd management.

TI  == senior thai fecal microbiota comparison between vegetarians and non-vegetarians using pcr-dgge and real-time pcr.
AB  == the fecal microbiotas were investigated in 13 healthy thai subjects using polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). among the 186 dna bands detected on the polyacrylamide gel, 37 bands were identified as representing 11 species: bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides  ovatus, bacteroides uniformis, bacteroides vulgatus, clostridium colicanis, eubacterium eligenes, e. rectale, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, megamonas funiformis, prevotella copri, and roseburia intestinalis, belonging mainly to the groups of bacteroides, prevotella, clostridium, and f. prausnitzii. a dendrogram  of the pcr-dgge divided the subjects; vegetarians and non-vegetarians. the fecal  microbiotas were also analyzed using a quantitative real-time pcr focused on bacteroides, bifidobacterium, enterobacteriaceae, clostrium coccoides-eubacterium rectale, c. leptum, lactobacillus, and prevotella. the nonvegetarian and vegetarian subjects were found to have significant differences in the high abundance of the bacteroides and prevotella genera, respectively. no significant  differences were found in the counts of bifidabacterium, enterobacteriaceae, c. coccoides-e. rectale group, c. leptum group, and lactobacillus. therefore, these  findings on the microbiota of healthy thais consuming different diets could provide helpful data for predicting the health of south east asians with similar  diets.

TI  == cd4cd8alphaalpha lymphocytes, a novel human regulatory t cell subset induced by colonic bacteria and deficient in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  == how the microbiota affects health and disease is a crucial question. in mice, gut clostridium bacteria are potent inducers of colonic interleukin (il)-10-producing foxp3 regulatory t cells (treg), which play key roles in the prevention of colitis and in systemic immunity. in humans, although gut microbiota dysbiosis is associated with immune disorders, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. in contrast with mice, the contribution of foxp3 treg in colitis prevention has been questioned, suggesting that other compensatory regulatory cells or mechanisms may exist. here we addressed the regulatory role of the cd4cd8 t cells whose presence had been reported in the intestinal mucosa and blood. using colonic lamina propria lymphocytes (lpl) and peripheral blood lymphocytes (pbl) from healthy individuals, and those with colon cancer and irritable bowel disease (ibd), we demonstrated that cd4cd8alphaalpha (dp8alpha) t lymphocytes expressed most of the regulatory markers and functions of foxp3 treg and secreted il-10. strikingly, dp8alpha lpl and pbl exhibited a highly skewed repertoire toward the recognition  of faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a major clostridium species of the human gut microbiota, which is decreased in patients with ibd. furthermore, the frequencies of dp8alpha pbl and colonic lpl were lower in patients with ibd than in healthy donors and in the healthy mucosa of patients with colon cancer, respectively. moreover, pbl and lpl from most patients with active ibd failed to respond to f.  prausnitzii in contrast to pbl and lpl from patients in remission and/or healthy  donors. these data (i) uncover a clostridium-specific il-10-secreting treg subset present in the human colonic lp and blood, (ii) identify f. prausnitzii as a major inducer of these treg, (iii) argue that these cells contribute to the control or prevention of colitis, opening new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for ibd, and (iv) provide new tools to address the systemic impact of  both these treg and the intestinal microbiota on the human immune homeostasis.

TI  == mucosa-associated faecalibacterium prausnitzii and escherichia coli co-abundance  can distinguish irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease phenotypes.
AB  == background: crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc) diagnosis requires comprehensive examination of the patient. faecalibacterium prausnitzii and escherichia coli have been reported as representatives of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) dysbiosis. the aim was to determine whether or not quantification of these species can be used as a complementary tool either for diagnostic or prognostic purposes. methods: mucosa-associated f. prausnitzii and e. coli abundance was determined in 28 controls (h), 45 cd, 28 uc patients and 10 irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) subjects by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) and the f. prausnitzii-e. coli index (f-e index) was calculated. species abundances were normalized to total bacteria and human cells. data was analyzed taking into account patients' phenotype and most relevant clinical characteristics. results: ibd patients had lower f. prausnitzii abundance than h  and ibs (p<0.001). cd patients showed higher e. coli counts than h and uc patients (p<0.001). the f-e index discriminated between h, cd and uc patients, and even between disease phenotypes that are usually difficult to distinguish as  ileal-cd (i-cd) from ileocolonic-cd and colonic-cd from extensive colitis. e. coli increased in active cd patients, and remission in i-cd patients was compromised by high abundance of this species. treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor (tnf) alpha diminished e. coli abundance in i-cd whereas none of the treatments counterbalanced f. prausnitzii depletion. conclusion: f. prausnitzii and e. coli are useful indicators to assist in ibd phenotype classification. the  abundance of these species could also be used as a supporting prognostic tool in  i-cd patients. our data indicates that current medication does not restore the levels of these two species to those found in a healthy gut.

TI  == genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of bifidobacterium adolescentis l2-32 and  faecalibacterium prausnitzii a2-165 and their interaction.
AB  == background: the gut microbiota plays an important role in human health and disease by acting as a metabolic organ. metagenomic sequencing has shown how dysbiosis in the gut microbiota is associated with human metabolic diseases such  as obesity and diabetes. modeling may assist to gain insight into the metabolic implication of an altered microbiota. fast and accurate reconstruction of metabolic models for members of the gut microbiota, as well as methods to simulate a community of microorganisms, are therefore needed. the integrated microbial genomes (img) database contains functional annotation for nearly 4,650  bacterial genomes. this tremendous new genomic information adds new opportunities for systems biology to reconstruct accurate genome scale metabolic models (gems). results: here we assembled a reaction data set containing 2,340 reactions obtained from existing genome-scale metabolic models, where each reaction is assigned with kegg orthology. the reaction data set was then used to reconstruct  two genome scale metabolic models for gut microorganisms available in the img database bifidobacterium adolescentis l2-32, which produces acetate during fermentation, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii a2-165, which consumes acetate and produces butyrate. f. prausnitzii is less abundant in patients with crohn's disease and has been suggested to play an anti-inflammatory role in the gut ecosystem. the b. adolescentis model, ibif452, comprises 699 reactions and 611 unique metabolites. the f. prausnitzii model, ifap484, comprises 713 reactions and 621 unique metabolites. each model was validated with in vivo data. we used optcom and flux balance analysis to simulate how both organisms interact. conclusions: the consortium of ibif452 and ifap484 was applied to predict f. prausnitzii's demand for acetate and production of butyrate which plays an essential role in colonic homeostasis and cancer prevention. the assembled reaction set is a useful tool to generate bacterial draft models from kegg orthology.

TI  == decline in presumptively protective gut bacterial species and metabolites are paradoxically associated with disease improvement in pediatric crohn's disease during enteral nutrition.
AB  == background: the gut microbiota is implicated in the pathogenesis of crohn's disease (cd). exclusive enteral nutrition (een) is a successful treatment, but its mode of action remains unknown. this study assessed serial changes in the fecal microbiota milieu during een. methods: five fecal samples were collected from cd children: 4 during een (start, 15, 30, end een approximately 60 days) and the fifth on habitual diet. two samples were collected from healthy control subjects. fecal ph, bacterial metabolites, global microbial diversity abundance,  composition stability, and quantitative changes of total and 7 major bacterial groups previously implicated in cd were measured. results: overall, 68 samples were from 15 cd children and 40 from 21 control subjects. fecal ph and total sulfide increased and butyric acid decreased during een (all p < 0.05). global bacterial diversity abundance decreased (p < 0.05); a higher degree of microbiota composition stability was seen in control subjects than in cd children during een (at p </= 0.008). faecalibacterium prausnitzii spp concentration significantly decreased after 30 days on een (p < 0.05). in patients who responded to een, the  magnitude of the observed changes was greater and the concentration of bacteroides/prevotella group decreased (p < 0.05). all these changes reverted to  pretreatment levels on free diet, and een microbiota diversity increased when the children returned to their free diet. conclusions: een impacts on gut microbiota  composition and changes fecal metabolic activity. it is difficult to infer a causative association between such changes and disease improvement, but the results do challenge the current perception of a protective role for f. prausnitzii in cd.

TI  == disrupted intestinal microbiota and intestinal inflammation in children with cystic fibrosis and its restoration with lactobacillus gg: a randomised clinical  trial.
AB  == background & aims: intestinal inflammation is a hallmark of cystic fibrosis (cf). administration of probiotics can reduce intestinal inflammation and the incidence of pulmonary exacerbations. we investigated the composition of intestinal microbiota in children with cf and analyzed its relationship with intestinal inflammation. we also investigated the microflora structure before and after lactobacillus gg (lgg) administration in children with cf with and without antibiotic treatment. methods: the intestinal microbiota were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish). intestinal inflammation was assessed by measuring fecal calprotectin (clp) and rectal nitric oxide (rno) production in children with cf as compared with healthy controls. we  then carried out a small double-blind randomized clinical trial with lgg. results: twenty-two children with cf children were enrolled in the study (median  age, 7 years; range, 2-9 years). fecal clp and rno levels were higher in children with cf than in healthy controls (184+/-146 microg/g vs. 52+/-46 microg/g; 18+/-15 vs. 2.6+/-1.2 micromol/l no2 (-), respectively; p<0.01). compared with healthy controls, children with cf had significantly different intestinal microbial core structures. the levels of eubacterium rectale, bacteroides uniformis, bacteroides vulgatus, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium catenulatum, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were reduced in children with cf. a similar but more extreme pattern was observed in children with cf who were taking antibiotics. lgg administration reduced fecal clp and partially restored intestinal microbiota. there was a significant correlation between reduced microbial richness and intestinal inflammation. conclusions: cf causes qualitative and quantitative changes in intestinal microbiota, which may represent a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of cf. administration of probiotics restored gut microbiota, supporting the efficacy of probiotics in reducing intestinal inflammation and pulmonary exacerbations. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct 01961661.

TI  == microbiota and epigenetic regulation of inflammatory mediators in type 2 diabetes and obesity.
AB  == metabolic syndrome is associated with alterations in the structure of the gut microbiota leading to low-grade inflammatory responses. an increased penetration  of the impaired gut membrane by bacterial components is believed to induce this inflammation, possibly involving epigenetic alteration of inflammatory molecules  such as toll-like receptors (tlrs). we evaluated changes of the gut microbiota and epigenetic dna methylation of tlr2 and tlr4 in three groups of subjects: type 2 diabetics under glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist therapy, obese individuals without established insulin resistance, and a lean control group. clostridium cluster iv, clostridium cluster xiva, lactic acid bacteria, faecalibacterium prausnitzii and bacteroidetes abundances were analysed by pcr and 454 high-throughput sequencing. the epigenetic methylation in the regulatory region of tlr4 and tlr2 was analysed using bisulfite conversion and pyrosequencing. we observed a significantly higher ratio of firmicutes/ bacteroidetes in type 2 diabetics compared to lean controls and obese. major differences were shown in lactic acid bacteria, with the highest abundance in type 2 diabetics, followed by obese and lean participants. in comparison, f. prausnitzii was least abundant in  type 2 diabetics, and most abundant in lean controls. methylation analysis of four cpgs in the first exon of tlr4 showed significantly lower methylation in obese individuals, but no significant difference between type 2 diabetics and lean controls. methylation of seven cpgs in the promoter region of tlr2 was significantly lower in type 2 diabetics compared to obese subjects and lean controls. the methylation levels of both tlrs were significantly correlated with  body mass index. our data suggest that changes in gut microbiota and thus cell wall components are involved in the epigenetic regulation of inflammatory reactions. an improved diet targeted to induce gut microbial balance and in the following even epigenetic changes of pro-inflammatory genes may be effective in the prevention of metabolic syndrome.

TI  == abundance and diversity of gi microbiota rather than igg4 levels correlate with abdominal inconvenience and gut permeability in consumers claiming food intolerances.
AB  == food intolerances are an increasing global health problem. interactions between genetics and environmental changes such as microbial- and stress factors remain poorly understood. whereas the analyses of ige mediated allergic responses is based on solid concepts, the roles of microbiota, gut permeability, and igg antibodies remain widely unclear and are under fierce discussion for scientific relevance. the present pilot study analyzes forty participants, under consultation of nutritional health professionals, for gastrointestinal discomfort and claimed food intolerances. food frequency questionnaire addresses nutrition,  lifestyle and present discomfort. feces samples are analyzed for dominant microbiota using 16s rdna based methods and the fecal marker calprotectin. blood  samples are analyzed for igg4 levels. the total microbial abundance significantly correlates with claimed discomfort (r=-0.37; p=0.02). the abundance and diversity of microbiota significantly correlates with low calprotectin values (r=-0.35; p=0.01) and with higher abundance of faecalibacterium prausnitzii (r=0.78; p<0.01) and akkermansia (r=0.82; p<0.01). participants with low discomfort show enhanced clostridium cluster xiva (p=0.008). an increased diversity is also correlating with reduced antibodies against igg4 of egg white (r=0.68; p<0.01). data suggest an interaction of low gut permeability and reduced inflammation with an established microbial equilibrium. self-reported abdominal inconvenience of participants relates mainly to characteristics of microbiota and gut permeability. anti-inflammatory effects of faecalibacterium prausnitzii or lactobacilli and gut barrier functions of akkermansia may have a key role in food intolerances. the role of igg4 linking food immune responses with intolerances remains unclear.

TI  == increased proportions of bifidobacterium and the lactobacillus group and loss of  butyrate-producing bacteria in inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  == dysbiosis in the intestinal microbiota of persons with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) has been described, but there are still varied reports on changes in the abundance of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus organisms in patients with ibd. the aim of this investigation was to compare the compositions of mucosa-associated and fecal bacteria in patients with ibd and in healthy controls (hcs). fecal and biopsy samples from 21 hcs, 21 and 15 crohn's disease (cd) patients, and 34 and 29 ulcerative colitis (uc) patients, respectively, were analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr targeting the 16s rrna gene. the bacterial numbers were transformed into relative percentages for statistical analysis. the  proportions of bacteria were uniformly distributed along the colon regardless of  the disease state. bifidobacterium was significantly increased in the biopsy specimens of active uc patients compared to those in the hcs (4.6% versus 2.1%, p = 0.001), and the proportion of bifidobacterium was significantly higher in the biopsy specimens than in the fecal samples in active cd patients (2.7% versus 2.0%, p = 0.012). the lactobacillus group was significantly increased in the biopsy specimens of active cd patients compared to those in the hcs (3.4% versus  2.3%, p = 0.036). compared to the hcs, faecalibacterium prausnitzii was sharply decreased in both the fecal and biopsy specimens of the active cd patients (0.3%  versus 14.0%, p < 0.0001 for fecal samples; 0.8% versus 11.4%, p < 0.0001 for biopsy specimens) and the active uc patients (4.3% versus 14.0%, p = 0.001 for fecal samples; 2.8% versus 11.4%, p < 0.0001 for biopsy specimens). in conclusion, bifidobacterium and the lactobacillus group were increased in active  ibd patients and should be used more cautiously as probiotics during the active phase of ibd. butyrate-producing bacteria might be important to gut homeostasis.

AB  == background: butyrate, which is produced by the human microbiome, is essential for a well-functioning colon. bacteria that produce butyrate are phylogenetically diverse, which hinders their accurate detection based on conventional phylogenetic markers. as a result, reliable information on this important bacterial group is often lacking in microbiome research. results: in this study we describe a gene-targeted approach for 454 pyrotag sequencing and quantitative  polymerase chain reaction for the final genes in the two primary bacterial butyrate synthesis pathways, butyryl-coa:acetate coa-transferase (but) and butyrate kinase (buk). we monitored the establishment and early succession of butyrate-producing communities in four patients with ulcerative colitis who underwent a colectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis and compared it with three control samples from healthy colons. all patients established an abundant butyrate-producing community (approximately 5% to 26% of the total community) in  the pouch within the 2-month study, but patterns were distinctive among individuals. only one patient harbored a community profile similar to the healthy controls, in which there was a predominance of but genes that are similar to reference genes from acidaminococcus sp., eubacterium sp., faecalibacterium prausnitzii and roseburia sp., and an almost complete absence of buk genes. two patients were greatly enriched in buk genes similar to those of clostridium butyricum and c. perfringens, whereas a fourth patient displayed abundant communities containing both genes. most butyrate producers identified in previous studies were detected and the general patterns of taxa found were supported by 16s rrna gene pyrotag analysis, but the gene-targeted approach provided more detail about the potential butyrate-producing members of the community. conclusions: the presented approach provides quantitative and genotypic insights  into butyrate-producing communities and facilitates a more specific functional characterization of the intestinal microbiome. furthermore, our analysis refines  but and buk reference annotations found in central databases.

TI  == the commensal bacterium faecalibacterium prausnitzii is protective in dnbs-induced chronic moderate and severe colitis models.
AB  == background: the abundance of faecalibacterium prausnitzii, an abundant and representative bacterium of firmicutes phylum, has consistently been observed to  be lower in patients with crohn's disease than in healthy individuals. we have shown that both f. prausnitzii and its culture supernatant (sn) have anti-inflammatory and protective effects in a tnbs-induced acute colitis mouse model. here, we tested the effects of both f. prausnitzii and its sn in moderate  and severe dnbs-induced chronic colitis mouse models. methods: colitis was induced by intrarectal administration of dnbs. after either 4 or 10 days of recovery (severe and moderate protocols, respectively), groups of mice were intragastrically administered either with f. prausnitzii a2-165 or with its culture sn for 7 or 10 days. three days before being sacrificed, colitis was reactivated by administration of a lower dose of dnbs. the severity of colitis at the time of being sacrificed was assessed by weight loss and macroscopic and microscopic scores. myeloperoxidase (mpo) activity, cytokine levels, lymphocyte populations, and changes in microbiota were studied. results: intragastric administration of either f. prausnitzii or its sn led to a significant decrease in colitis severity in both severe and moderate chronic colitis models. the lower severity of colitis was associated with down-regulation of mpo, pro-inflammatory  cytokines, and t-cell levels. conclusions: we show, for the first time, protective effects of both f. prausnitzii and its sn during both the period of recovery from chronic colitis and colitis reactivation. these results provide further evidence that f. prausnitzii is an anti-inflammatory bacterium with therapeutic potential for patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  == altered intestinal microbiota and blood t cell phenotype are shared by patients with crohn's disease and their unaffected siblings.
AB  == objective: crohn's disease (cd) is associated with intestinal dysbiosis, altered  blood t cell populations, elevated faecal calprotectin (fc) and increased intestinal permeability (ip). cd-associated features present in siblings (increased risk of cd) but not in healthy controls, provide insight into early cd pathogenesis. we aimed to (1) delineate the genetic, immune and microbiological profile of patients with cd, their siblings and controls and (2) determine which  factors discriminate between groups. design: faecal microbiology was analysed by  quantitative pcr targeting 16s ribosomal rna, fc by elisa, blood t cell phenotype by flow cytometry and ip by differential lactulose-rhamnose absorption in 22 patients with inactive cd, 21 of their healthy siblings and 25 controls. subject's genotype relative risk was determined by illumina immuno beadchip. results: strikingly, siblings shared aspects of intestinal dysbiosis with patients with cd (lower concentrations of faecalibacterium prausnitzii (p=0.048), clostridia cluster iv (p=0.003) and roseburia spp. (p=0.09) compared with controls). as in cd, siblings demonstrated a predominance of memory t cells (p=0.002) and elevated naive cd4 t cell beta7 integrin expression (p=0.01) compared with controls. fc was elevated (>50 mug/g) in 8/21 (38%) siblings compared with 2/25 (8%) controls (p=0.028); whereas ip did not differ between siblings and controls. discriminant function analysis determined that combinations of these factors significantly discriminated between groups (chi(2)=80.4, df=20, p<0.001). siblings were separated from controls by immunological and microbiological variables. conclusions: healthy siblings of patients with cd manifest immune and microbiological abnormalities associated with cd distinct from their genotype-related risk and provide an excellent model  in which to investigate early cd pathogenesis.

TI  == effects of short chain fatty acid producing bacteria on epigenetic regulation of  ffar3 in type 2 diabetes and obesity.
AB  == the human gut microbiota and microbial influences on lipid and glucose metabolism, satiety, and chronic low-grade inflammation are known to be involved  in metabolic syndrome. fermentation end products, especially short chain fatty acids, are believed to engage the epigenetic regulation of inflammatory reactions via ffars (free fatty acid receptor) and other short chain fatty acid receptors.  we studied a potential interaction of the microbiota with epigenetic regulation in obese and type 2 diabetes patients compared to a lean control group over a four month intervention period. intervention comprised a glp-1 agonist (glucagon-like peptide 1) for type 2 diabetics and nutritional counseling for both intervention groups. microbiota was analyzed for abundance, butyryl-coa:acetate coa-transferase gene and for diversity by polymerase chain reaction and 454 high-throughput sequencing. epigenetic methylation of the promoter region of ffar3 and line1 (long interspersed nuclear element 1) was analyzed using bisulfite conversion and pyrosequencing. the diversity of the microbiota as well as the abundance of faecalibacterium prausnitzii were significantly lower in obese and type 2 diabetic patients compared to lean individuals. results from clostridium cluster iv and clostridium cluster xiva showed a decreasing trend in type 2 diabetics in comparison to the butyryl-coa:acetate coa-transferase gene and according to melt curve analysis. during intervention no significant changes were observed in either intervention group. the analysis of five cpgs in the promoter region of ffar3 showed a significant lower methylation in obese and type 2 diabetics with an increase in obese patients over the intervention period. these results disclosed a significant correlation between a higher body mass index and lower methylation of ffar3. line-1, a marker of global methylation, indicated no significant differences between the three groups or the time points, although methylation of  type 2 diabetics tended to increase over time. our results provide evidence that  a different composition of gut microbiota in obesity and type 2 diabetes affect the epigenetic regulation of genes. interactions between the microbiota and epigenetic regulation may involve not only short chain fatty acids binding to ffars. therefore dietary interventions influencing microbial composition may be considered as an option in the engagement against metabolic syndrome.

TI  == the abundance of fecal faecalibacterium prausnitzii in relation to obesity and gender in chinese adults.
AB  == the influence of gender and obesity on the abundance of human colonic feacalibacterium prausnitzii is currently unclear. we collected fecal samples from 54 obese and 54 sex- and age-matched normal-weight chinese adults and quantified the fecal f. prausnitzii as percentage of 16s rrna gene copies of f. prausnitzii accounting to that of total gut bacteria with quantitative pcr. the fecal f. prausnitzii amount was not significantly different between obese and lean subjects. men possessed significantly lower level of fecal f. prausnitzii than women, and the significant and positive correlation of fecal f. prausnitzii  quantity with fasting glucose level was observed in men, not in women. our results suggest that the gender effect, in addition to other factors including the geographic location, ethnicity, diet and gut transit times of study subjects, has to be considered when studying the relationship between gut f. prausnitzii and diseases.

TI  == additional oligofructose/inulin does not increase faecal bifidobacteria in critically ill patients receiving enteral nutrition: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  == background & aims: patients with diarrhoea during enteral nutrition (en) have been shown to have low faecal bifidobacteria concentrations. oligofructose/inulin selectively stimulate the growth of bifidobacteria in healthy humans. this study  investigates the effect of additional oligofructose/inulin on the gastrointestinal microbiota, short-chain fatty acids (scfa) and faecal output in  patients receiving en. methods: adult patients in the intensive care unit (icu) who were starting en with a formula containing fibre were randomised to receive 7 g/d of additional oligofructose/inulin or an identically packaged placebo (maltodextrin). a fresh faecal sample was collected at baseline and following at  least 7 days of supplementation. faecal microbiota were analysed using fluorescent in-situ hybridisation and faecal output was monitored daily. results: twenty-two patients (mean age 71 years) completed at least 7 days of intervention (mean 12 days). at the end of the intervention, there were no significant differences in the concentrations of bifidobacteria between the groups, after adjusting for baseline values (oligofructose/inulin 6.9 + 1.4, placebo 7.8 + 1.3  log10 cells/g dry faeces, p > 0.05), but there were significantly lower concentrations of faecalibacterium prausnitzii (7.0 + 1.0 vs. 8.4 + 1.3 log10 cells/g, p = 0.01) and bacteroides-prevotella (9.1 + 1.0 vs. 9.9 + 0.9 log10 cells/g, p = 0.05) in patients receiving additional oligofructose/inulin. there were no differences in faecal concentrations of any scfa, secretory iga, daily faecal score or incidence of diarrhoea between the two groups. conclusions: additional oligofructose/inulin did not increase faecal bifidobacteria in critically ill patients receiving en, although it did result in lower concentrations of f. prausnitzii and bacteroides-prevotella. this trial is registered at http://controlled-trials.com. identifier: isrctn06446184.

TI  == association of dietary type with fecal microbiota in vegetarians and omnivores in slovenia.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this study was to discover differences in the human fecal microbiota composition driven by long-term omnivore versus vegan/lacto-vegetarian dietary pattern. in addition, the possible association of demographic characteristics and dietary habits such as consumption of particular foods with the fecal microbiota was examined. methods: this study was conducted on a slovenian population comprising 31 vegetarian participants (11 lacto-vegetarians  and 20 vegans) and 29 omnivore participants. bacterial dna was extracted from the frozen fecal samples by maxwell 16 tissue dna purification kit (promega). relative quantification of selected bacterial groups was performed by real-time pcr. differences in fecal microbiota composition were evaluated by pcr-dgge fingerprinting of the v3 16s rrna region. participants' demographic characteristics, dietary habits and health status information were collected through a questionnaire. results: vegetarian diet was associated with higher ratio (% of group-specific dna in relation to all bacterial dna) of bacteroides-prevotella, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, clostridium clostridioforme and faecalibacterium prausnitzii, but with lower ratio (%) of clostridium cluster xiva. real-time pcr also showed a higher concentration and ratio of enterobacteriaceae (16s rdna copies/g and %) in female participants (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01) and decrease in bifidobacterium with age (p < 0.01). dgge analysis of the 16s rrna v3 region showed that relative quantity of dgge bands from certain bacterial groups was lower (bifidobacterium, streptococus, collinsella and lachnospiraceae) or higher (subdoligranulum) among vegetarians, indicating the association of dietary type with bacterial community composition. sequencing of selected dgge bands revealed the presence of common representatives of fecal microbiota: bacteroides, eubacterium, faecalibacterium, ruminococcaceae, bifidobacterium and lachnospiraceae. up to 4 % of variance in microbial community analyzed by dgge could be explained by the vegetarian type of diet. conclusions:  long-term vegetarian diet contributed to quantity and associated bacterial community shifts in fecal microbiota composition. consumption of foods of animal  origin (eggs, red meat, white meat, milk, yoghurt, other dairy products, fish and seafood) and vegetarian type of diet explained the largest share of variance in microbial community structure. fecal microbiota composition was also associated with participants' age, gender and body mass.

TI  == resistant starch induces catabolic but suppresses immune and cell division pathways and changes the microbiome in the proximal colon of male pigs.
AB  == consumption of resistant starch (rs) has been associated with various intestinal  health benefits, but knowledge of its effects on global gene expression in the colon is limited. the main objective of the current study was to identify genes affected by rs in the proximal colon to infer which biologic pathways were modulated. ten 17-wk-old male pigs, fitted with a cannula in the proximal colon for repeated collection of tissue biopsy samples and luminal content, were fed a  digestible starch (ds) diet or a diet high in rs (34%) for 2 consecutive periods  of 14 d in a crossover design. analysis of the colonic transcriptome profiles revealed that, upon rs feeding, oxidative metabolic pathways, such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle and beta-oxidation, were induced, whereas many immune response pathways, including adaptive and innate immune system, as well as cell division were suppressed. the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated  receptor gamma was identified as a potential key upstream regulator. rs significantly (p < 0.05) increased the relative abundance of several butyrate-producing microbial groups, including the butyrate producers faecalibacterium prausnitzii and megasphaera elsdenii, and reduced the abundance  of potentially pathogenic members of the genus leptospira and the phylum proteobacteria. concentrations in carotid plasma of the 3 main short-chain fatty  acids acetate, propionate, and butyrate were significantly higher with rs consumption compared with ds consumption. overall, this study provides novel insights on effects of rs in proximal colon and contributes to our understanding  of a healthy diet.

TI  == starch structure modulates metabolic activity and gut microbiota profile.
AB  == normal maize starch and high amylose maize starch (has) either in native or thermally treated forms were used to investigate the effect of starch structure on the production of metabolites and gut microbiota profile using an anaerobic in vitro system. the changes in starch structure during fermentation were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (sem), high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) and fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (ftir). the native normal starch showed a porous structure during fermentation, indicating it was quickly metabolized by gut bacteria, whereas the has showed a smooth structure, suggesting it was utilized gradually. hplc chromatography showed that  amylose fraction with low molecular weight (mw) had a higher resistance to be fermented by gut bacteria than other starch molecular fractions. thermal treatment enhanced starch fermentation kinetics, especially for amylopectin and high mw amylose fractions. ftir analysis suggests that the structure of the normal starch, either in native or thermally treated, was less organized compared to has, and this structural character led to the normal starch to be utilized more quickly by gut bacteria with a faster increase in the ir ratio 1047/1022 cm(-1) (p < 0.01) during fermentation. the measurement of metabolic activity indicates that the normal starch with a less organized structure was utilized faster and generated more acetate and lactate during fermentation; has with a highly organized structure was more likely to produce butyrate, corresponding the significant increase (p < 0.001) in the populations of butyrate-producing strains (faecalibacterium prausnitzii and eubacterium hallii) in the cultures. this study reveals that fermentation kinetics of starch substrate is one of important characteristics for manipulating gut microbiota fermentation behaviours.

TI  == future for probiotic science in functional food and dietary supplement development.
AB  == purpose of review: the purpose of this study is to provide an update of probiotic science evolving from classical approaches to the development of next-generation  probiotics, parallel to advances in the understanding of the complexity of the gut microbiome and its role in human health. recent findings: the probiotic concept is based on the notion that the gut ecosystem contributes to human physiology and, consequently, its modulation may help to maintain health and reduce disease risk. the understanding of the complexity of the gut microbiota and the specific components associated with progression from health to disease is rapidly increasing, thanks to the use of high-throughput and next-generation sequencing techniques in progressively better controlled epidemiological studies. evidence on microbiome-mediated effects by intervention with classical probiotics on humans is, however, limited. the new information is helping to set a rationale for selection of a next generation of probiotics. candidates include clostridia clusters iv, xiva and xviii, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, akkermansia muciniphila and bacteroides uniformis, the effects of which have been evaluated in preclinical trials with promising results for inflammatory and diet-related disorders. yet, the extent to which new probiotic formulations consisting of nonconventional indigenous gut bacteria will be effective on humans at a population level or in personalized nutrition strategies remains to be explored.  summary: understanding the role that indigenous intestinal bacteria and their ecological interactions play in human health and disease based on epidemiological, intervention and mechanistic studies will provide a robust rationale for selection of probiotic strains and facilitate the optimization of integrated dietary strategies to efficiently modulate the human gut microbiome, leading to improvements in nutrition and clinical practice.

TI  == xylo-oligosaccharides and inulin affect genotoxicity and bacterial populations differently in a human colonic simulator challenged with soy protein.
AB  == high dietary intakes of some protein sources, including soy protein, can increase colonic dna damage in animals, whereas some carbohydrates attenuate this. we investigated whether inulin and xylo-oligosaccharides (xos) could be protective against dna strand breaks by adding them to a human colonic simulator consisting  of a proximal vessel (pv) (ph 5.5) and a distal vessel (dv) (ph 6.8) inoculated with human faeces and media containing soy protein. genotoxicity of the liquid phase and microbial population changes in the vessels were measured. soy protein  (3%) was fermented with 1% low amylose cornstarch for 10 day followed by soy protein with 1% xos or 1% inulin for 10 day. inulin did not alter genotoxicity but xos significantly reduced pv genotoxicity and increased dv genotoxicity. inulin and xos significantly increased butyrate concentration in the dv but not pv. numbers of the key butyrate-producing bacterium faecalibacterium prausnitzii  were significantly increased in the pv and dv by inulin but significantly decreased by xos in both vessels. other bacteria examined were also significantly impacted by the carbohydrate treatments or by the vessel (i.e., ph). there was a  significant overall inverse correlation between levels of damage induced by the ferments and levels of sulphate-reducing bacteria, bacteroides fragilis, and acetate. in conclusion, dietary xos can potentially modulate the genotoxicity of  the colonic environment and specific bacterial groups and short chain fatty acids may mediate this.

TI  == temporal bacterial community dynamics vary among ulcerative colitis patients after fecal microbiota transplantation.
AB  == objectives: fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) from healthy donors, which is  an effective alternative for treatment of clostridium difficile-associated disease, is being considered for several disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and metabolic syndrome. disease remission upon fmt is thought to be facilitated by an efficient colonization of healthy donor microbiota, but knowledge of the composition and temporal stability of patient microbiota after fmt is lacking. methods: five patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (mayo score >/=6) and refractory to standard therapy received fmt via nasojejunal tube and enema. in addition to clinical activity and adverse events, the patients' fecal bacterial communities were monitored at multiple time points for up to 12 weeks using 16s rrna gene-targeted pyrosequencing. results: fmt elicited fever and a temporary increase of c-reactive protein. abundant bacteria from donors established in recipients, but  the efficiency and stability of donor microbiota colonization varied greatly. a positive clinical response was observed after 12 weeks in one patient whose microbiota had been effectively augmented by fmt. this augmentation was marked by successive colonization of donor-derived phylotypes including the anti-inflammatory and/or short-chain fatty acid-producing faecalibacterium prausnitzii, rosebura faecis, and bacteroides ovatus. disease severity (as measured by the mayo score) was associated with an overrepresentation of enterobacteriaceae and an underrepresentation of lachnospiraceae. conclusions: this study highlights the value of characterizing temporally resolved microbiota  dynamics for a better understanding of fmt efficacy and provides potentially useful diagnostic indicators for monitoring fmt success in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

TI  == a decrease of the butyrate-producing species roseburia hominis and faecalibacterium prausnitzii defines dysbiosis in patients with ulcerative colitis.
AB  == objective: bacteria play an important role in the onset and perpetuation of intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). unlike in crohn's disease (cd), in which dysbiosis has been better characterised, in ulcerative colitis (uc), only small cohorts have been studied and showed conflicting data. therefore, we evaluated in a large cohort if the microbial signature described in cd is also present in uc, and if we could characterise predominant dysbiosis in uc. to assess the functional impact of dysbiosis, we quantified the bacterial metabolites. design: the predominant microbiota from 127 uc patients and 87 age and sex-matched controls was analysed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analysis. differences were quantitatively validated using  real-time pcr. metabolites were quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. results: based on dgge analysis, the microbial signature previously described in cd was not present in uc. real-time pcr analysis revealed a lower abundance of roseburia hominis (p<0.0001) and faecalibacterium prausnitzii (p<0.0001) in uc patients compared to controls. both species showed an inverse correlation with disease activity. short-chain fatty acids (scfa) were reduced in uc patients (p=0.014), but no direct correlation between scfa and the identified  bacteria was found. conclusions: the composition of the fecal microbiota of uc patients differs from that of healthy individuals: we found a reduction in r hominis and f prausnitzii, both well-known butyrate-producing bacteria of the firmicutes phylum. these results underscore the importance of dysbiosis in ibd but suggest that different bacterial species contribute to the pathogenesis of uc and cd.

TI  == human gut microbiota changes reveal the progression of glucose intolerance.
AB  == to explore the relationship of gut microbiota with the development of type 2 diabetes (t2dm), we analyzed 121 subjects who were divided into 3 groups based on their glucose intolerance status: normal glucose tolerance (ngt; n = 44), prediabetes (pre-dm; n = 64), or newly diagnosed t2dm (n = 13). gut microbiota characterizations were determined with 16s rdna-based high-throughput sequencing. t2dm-related dysbiosis was observed, including the separation of microbial communities and a change of alpha diversity between the different glucose intolerance statuses. to assess the correlation between metabolic parameters and  microbiota diversity, clinical characteristics were also measured and a significant association between metabolic parameters (fpg, crp) and gut microbiota was found. in addition, a total of 28 operational taxonomic units (otus) were found to be related to t2dm status by the kruskal-wallis h test, most of which were enriched in the t2dm group. butyrate-producing bacteria (e.g. akkermansia muciniphila atccbaa-835, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii l2-6) had a higher abundance in the ngt group than in the pre-dm group. at genus level, the abundance of bacteroides in the t2dm group was only half that of the ngt and pre-dm groups. previously reported t2dm-related markers were also compared with the data in this study, and some inconsistencies were noted. we found that verrucomicrobiae may be a potential marker of t2dm as it had a significantly lower abundance in both the pre-dm and t2dm groups. in conclusion, this research  provides further evidence of the structural modulation of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of diabetes.

TI  == faecalibacterium prausnitzii supernatant improves intestinal barrier function in  mice dss colitis.
AB  == objective. the intestinal microbiota plays a substantial role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). faecalibacterium prausnitzii (fp) is underrepresented in ibd patients and have been suggested to have anti-inflammatory effects in mice. increased intestinal permeability is common in ibd but the relationship between fp and intestinal barrier function has not been  investigated. our aim was to study treatment with fp supernatant on intestinal barrier function in a dextran sodium sulfate (dss) colitis mice model. material and methods. c57bl/6 mice received 3% dss in tap water ad libitum during five days to induce colitis. from day 3 the mice received a daily gavage with fp supernatant or broth during seven days. ileum and colon were mounted in ussing chambers for permeability studies with (51)cr-edta and escherichia coli k-12. colon was saved for western blot analyses of tight junction proteins. results. dss-treated mice showed significant weight loss and colon shortening. gavage with fp supernatant resulted in a quicker recovery after dss treatment and less extensive colonic shortening. ileal mucosa of dss mice showed a significant increase in (51)cr-edta-passage compared to controls. (51)cr-edta passage was significantly decreased in mice receiving fp supernatant. no significant differences were observed in passage of e. coli k12. western blots showed a trend to increased claudin-1 and claudin-2 expressions in dss mice. conclusions. supernatant of fp enhances the intestinal barrier function by affecting paracellular permeability, and may thereby attenuate the severity of dss-induced  colitis in mice. these findings suggest a potential role of fp in the treatment of ibd.

TI  == prebiotic stimulation of human colonic butyrate-producing bacteria and bifidobacteria, in vitro.
AB  == dietary macronutrients affect the composition of the gut microbiota, and prebiotics are used to improve and maintain a healthy gut. the impact of prebiotics on dominant gut bacteria other than bifidobacteria, however, is under-researched. here, we report carbohydrate utilisation patterns for representative butyrate-producing anaerobes, belonging to the gram-positive firmicutes families lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae, by comparison with selected bacteroides and bifidobacterium species. growth assessments using anaerobic hungate tubes and a new rapid microtitre plate assay were generally in  good agreement. the bacteroides strains tested showed some growth on basal medium with no added carbohydrates, utilising peptides in the growth medium. the butyrate-producing strains exhibited different growth profiles on the substrates, which included starch, inulin, fructooligosaccharides (fos), galactooligosaccharides (gos) and xylooligosaccharides (xos). eleven were able to grow on short-chain fos, but this number decreased as the chain length of the fructan substrates increased. long-chain inulin was utilised by roseburia inulinivorans, but by none of the bifidobacterium species examined here. xos was  a more selective growth substrate than fos, with only six of the 11 firmicutes strains able to use xos for growth. these results illustrate the selectivity of different prebiotics and help to explain why some are butyrogenic.

TI  == arabinogalactan and fructo-oligosaccharides have a different fermentation profile in the simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem (shime (r)).
AB  == current prebiotics, such as fructo-oligosaccharides (fos), are limited in their persistence in the distal colon and are predominantly fermented in the proximal colon. in order to identify a potential alternative, the differences in the fermentation profile of arabinogalactan (ag) and fos have been assessed in the simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem. the effect of each product on the composition and activity of the microbial community was analysed during a  3-week treatment period at a dose of 5 g day(-1). while fos indeed was mainly fermented in the simulated proximal colon, ag was still available for fermentation in the simulated distal colon as shown by ph profiles, size exclusion chromatography and analyses of specific enzymatic activities. as a consequence, the main effect of the products (increase in propionate and butyrate and decrease in ammonium production) occurred in different intestinal areas. dgge and qpcr analyses confirmed that the main modulation of the microbiota by the two products occurred in different areas of the gut. ag was associated with a statistically significant increase in the concentration of total bacteria, bacteroidetes, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a delayed bifidogenic effect and a decrease of the pathogenic clostridium perfringens. fos led to a strong lactobacillogenic effect.

TI  == intestinal microbiota: a source of novel biomarkers in inflammatory bowel diseases?
AB  == the human intestine harbours a complex microbial ecosystem that performs manifold functions important to the nutrition and health of its host. extensive study has  revealed that the composition of the intestinal microbiota is altered in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). the ibd associated intestinal  microbiota generally has reduced species richness and diversity, lower temporal stability, and disruption of the secreted mucus layer structure. multiple studies have identified certain bacterial taxa that are enriched or depleted in ibd including enterobacteriaceae, ruminococcus gnavus, and desulfovibrio (enriched) and faecalibacterium prausnitzii, lachnospiraceae, and akkermansia (depleted). additionally, the relative abundance of some taxa appears to correlate with established markers of disease activity such as enterobacteriaceae (enriched) and lachnospiraceae (depleted). signature shifts in fecal microbial community composition may therefore prove to be valuable as diagnostic biomarkers, particularly for longitudinal monitoring of disease activity and response to treatments.

AB  == background: although incrimination of the intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of ibd is widely accepted, few data are available about the role of  specific bacteria. potentially, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, bacteria with anti-inflammatory properties, might be deficient in ulcerative colitis (uc). aim: to quantify f. prausnitzii in the faecal microbiota of uc patients in remission and determine its relationship with relapse. methods: a cross-sectional study included 116 uc patients in remission, 29 first-degree relatives and 31 healthy controls. a subset of eighteen patients, recruited during the first month of remission, underwent a 1-year follow-up. total bacteria and f. prausnitzii were measured by quantitative real time pcr (qpcr, copies/g). calprotectin was determined as inflammatory index (mug/g). results: we found that f. prausnitzii was reduced in patients (median, iqr: 1.4 x 10(8) , 5.1 x 10(7)-4.5 x 10(8)) and  relatives (1.7 x 10(8), 9.3 x 10(7)-5.1 x 10(8)) vs. controls (6.5 x 10(8), 3.7 x 10(8)-1.6 x 10(9), p < 0.0001). moreover, low counts of f. prausnitzii were associated with less than 12 months of remission (8.0 x 10(7), 2.0 x 10(7)-3.5 x  10(8) vs. 2.1 x 10(8), 1.0 x 10(8)-7.9 x 10(8), p < 0.001) and more than 1 relapse/year (8.0 x 10(7), 3.2 x 10(7)-3.8 x 10(8) vs. 1.9 x 10(8), 6.8 x 10(7)-6.0 x 10(8), p < 0.01). when patients were followed up, f. prausnitzii increased steadily until reaching similar levels to those of controls if remission persisted (2.9 x 10(8), 9.3 x 10(6)-1.2 x 10(9); calprotectin: 76, 19-212), whereas it remained low if patients relapsed (2.2 x 10(8), 1.4 x 10(6)-3.3 x 10(8); calprotectin: 1760, 844-3662 p < 0.05 vs. controls). conclusions: defective gut colonisation by f. prausnitzii occurred in uc patients during remission and in their unaffected relatives. the recovery of the f. prausnitzii population after relapse is associated with maintenance of clinical remission.

TI  == bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and faecalibacterium prausnitzii influence the production of mucus glycans and the development of goblet cells in the colonic epithelium of a gnotobiotic model rodent.
AB  == background: the intestinal mucus layer plays a key role in the maintenance of host-microbiota homeostasis. to document the crosstalk between the host and microbiota, we used gnotobiotic models to study the influence of two major commensal bacteria, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and faecalibacterium prausnitzii, on this intestinal mucus layer. b. thetaiotaomicron is known to use  polysaccharides from mucus, but its effect on goblet cells has not been addressed so far. f. prausnitzii is of particular physiological importance because it can be considered as a sensor and a marker of human health. we determined whether b.  thetaiotaomicron affected goblet cell differentiation, mucin synthesis and glycosylation in the colonic epithelium. we then investigated how f. prausnitzii  influenced the colonic epithelial responses to b. thetaiotaomicron. results: b. thetaiotaomicron, an acetate producer, increased goblet cell differentiation, expression of mucus-related genes and the ratio of sialylated to sulfated mucins  in mono-associated rats. b. thetaiotaomicron, therefore, stimulates the secretory lineage, favoring mucus production. when b. thetaiotaomicron was associated with  f. prausnitzii, an acetate consumer and a butyrate producer, the effects on goblet cells and mucin glycosylation were diminished. f. prausnitzii, by attenuating the effects of b. thetaiotaomicron on mucus, may help the epithelium  to maintain appropriate proportions of different cell types of the secretory lineage. using a mucus-producing cell line, we showed that acetate up-regulated klf4, a transcription factor involved in goblet cell differentiation. conclusions: b. thetaiotaomicron and f. prausnitzii, which are metabolically complementary, modulate, in vivo, the intestinal mucus barrier by modifying goblet cells and mucin glycosylation. our study reveals the importance of the balance between two main commensal bacteria in maintaining colonic epithelial homeostasis via their respective effects on mucus.

TI  == fecal microbial diversity in pre-weaned dairy calves as described by pyrosequencing of metagenomic 16s rdna. associations of faecalibacterium species  with health and growth.
AB  == in this study, we use barcoded pyrosequencing of the 16s rrna gene to characterize the fecal microbiota of neonatal calves and identify possible relationships of certain microbiota profiles with health and weight gain. fecal samples were obtained weekly from 61 calves from birth until weaning (seventh week of the calves' life). firmicutes was the most prevalent phylum, with a prevalence ranging from 63.84% to 81.90%, followed by bacteroidetes (8.36% to 23.93%), proteobacteria (3.72% to 9.75%), fusobacteria (0.76% to 5.67%), and actinobacteria (1.02% to 2.35%). chao1 index gradually increased from the first to the seventh postnatal week. chao1 index was lower during the third, fourth, and fifth week of life in calves that suffered from pneumonia and were treated with antibiotics. diarrhea incidence during the first four weeks of the calves' life was also associated with a reduction of microbial diversity during the third week of life. increased fecal microbial diversity after the second week of life was associated with higher weight gain. using discriminant analysis we were able  to show differences in the microbiota profiles between different weeks of life, between high and low weight gain groups of calves, and between calves affected and not affected with diarrhea during the first four weeks life. the prevalence of faecalibacterium spp. in the first week of life was associated with weight gain and the incidence of diarrhea, with higher prevalence being associated with  higher weight gain and less diarrhea. representative sequences from faecalibacterium spp. were closely affiliated to faecalibacterium prausnitzii. results presented here provide new information regarding the intestinal microbiota of neonatal calves and its association with health and growth. fecal microbial diversity was associated with calf age, disease status and growth rates. results suggesting a possible beneficial effect of faecalibacterium spp. on health and growth are promising.

TI  == faecalibacterium prausnitzii upregulates regulatory t cells and anti-inflammatory cytokines in treating tnbs-induced colitis.
AB  == background and aims: faecalibacterium prausnitzii (f. prausnitzii) is a common anaerobic bacteria colonized in the human gut and inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) patients are usually lack of f. prausnitzii. the aims of this study were to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory capacity of f. prausnitzii by comparing it with bifidobacterium longum (b. longum) in both cellular and animal  experiments. methods: human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) and 2, 4,  6-trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (tnbs)-induced colitis rat models were treated with f. prausnitzii, b. longum, f. prausnitzii supernatant or f. prausnitzii medium, respectively. interleukin (il)-10, tgf-beta1 and il-12p70 in human pbmcs  culture supernatant and rat blood serum were detected. the frequency of cd25(+)foxp3(+)treg in human pbmcs, rat pbmcs and rat splenocytes were investigated. besides, the t-bet, gata-3, ror-gammat and foxp3 mrna in human pbmcs, histopathologic characteristics of the intestinal mucosal and weight loss  in the rat models were examined. results: f. prausnitzii, b. longum and f. prausnitzii supernatant clearly facilitated the induction of il-10 and tgf-beta1, while induced relatively mild production of il-12p70 in both cellular and animal  models. the f. prausnitzii, b. longum and supernatant differed in their capacity  to induce t-bet, gata-3 and ror-gammat mrna expression in human pbmcs (both bacterial strains inhibited the expression of ror-gammat while supernatant inhibited the t-bet and gata-3). however, all of them induced the foxp3 and treg  production and ameliorated the tnbs-induced colitis. in addition, f. prausnitzii  supernatant exhibited the supreme anti-inflammatory capacity. conclusions: f. prausnitzii and its unidentified metabolites in the supernatant are promising candidates in treating ibd, and further research remains necessary to elucidate the safety, efficacy, optimum and mechanism of this bacterium in the clinical practice.

TI  == cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) allelic variants relate to shifts in faecal microbiota of cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  == introduction: in this study we investigated the effects of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) gene variants on the composition of faecal microbiota, in patients affected by cystic fibrosis (cf). cftr mutations (f508del is the most common) lead to a decreased secretion of chloride/water, and to mucus sticky secretions, in pancreas, respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. intestinal manifestations are underestimated in cf, leading to ileum meconium at  birth, or small bowel bacterial overgrowth in adult age. methods: thirty-six cf patients, fasting and under no-antibiotic treatment, were cftr genotyped on both  alleles. faecal samples were subjected to molecular microbial profiling through temporal temperature gradient electrophoresis and species-specific pcr. ecological parameters and multivariate algorithms were employed to find out if cftr variants could be related to the microbiota structure. results: patients were classified by two different criteria: 1) presence/absence of f508del mutation; 2) disease severity in heterozygous and homozygous f508del patients. we found that homozygous-f508del and severe cf patients exhibited an enhanced dysbiotic faecal microbiota composition, even within the cf cohort itself, with higher biodiversity and evenness. we also found, by species-specific pcr, that potentially harmful species (escherichia coli and eubacterium biforme) were abundant in homozygous-f508del and severe cf patients, while beneficial species (faecalibacterium prausnitzii, bifidobacterium spp., and eubacterium limosum) were reduced. conclusions: this is the first report that establishes a link among cftr variants and shifts in faecal microbiota, opening the way to studies that perceive cf as a 'systemic disease', linking the lung and the gut in a joined axis.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus salivarius ls-33 on fecal microbiota in obese adolescents.
AB  == background & aims: this study is a part of the clinical trials with probiotic bacterium lactobacillus salivarius ls-33 conducted in obese adolescents. previously reported clinical studies showed no effect of ls-33 consumption on the metabolic syndrome in the subject group. the aim of the study was to investigate  the impact of l. salivarius ls-33 on fecal microbiota in obese adolescents. methods: the study was a double-blinded intervention with 50 subjects randomized  to intake of l. salivarius ls-33 or placebo for 12 weeks. the fecal microbiota was assessed by real-time quantitative pcr before and after intervention. concentrations of fecal short chain fatty acids were determined using gas chromatography. results: ratios of bacteroides-prevotella-porphyromonas group to  firmicutes belonging bacteria, including clostridium cluster xiv, blautia coccoides_eubacteria rectale group and roseburia intestinalis, were significantly increased (p </= 0.05) after administration of ls-33. the cell numbers of fecal bacteria, including the groups above as well as clostridium cluster i, clostridium cluster iv, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, enterobacteriaceae, enterococcus, the lactobacillus group and bifidobacterium were not significantly  altered by intervention. similarly, short chain fatty acids remained unaffected.  conclusion: l. salivarius ls-33 might modify the fecal microbiota in obese adolescents in a way not related to metabolic syndrome. clinical trial number: nct 01020617.

TI  == clostridium leptum group bacteria abundance and diversity in the fecal microbiota of patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a case-control study in india.
AB  == background: alterations in the fecal bacterial flora occur in inflammatory bowel  disease (ibd). we examined the abundance and diversity of clostridium leptum group, an important group of carbohydrate-fermenting bacteria, in the feces of patients with ibd and compared them with healthy controls. methods: seventeen healthy controls (hc), 20 patients with crohn's disease (cd) and 22 patients with ulcerative colitis (uc) participated in the study. dna extracted from fecal samples was amplified by pcr targeting 16s rrna gene sequences specific to c. leptum group. the pcr product was subjected to temporal temperature gradient electrophoresis (ttge) and the number and position of individual bands were noted and diversity was estimated. the identity of bands at different positions was confirmed by cloning and sequencing. real time quantitative pcr with mesa green,  targeted at specific 16s rrna gene sequences, was used to quantitate c. leptum group and its most prominent constituent, faecalibacterium prausnitzii. results:  twenty five different operational taxonomic units (otus, equivalent to species) were identified constituting the c. leptum group in these participants. their sequences were deposited in genbank [accession numbers gq465348 to gq465370]. otu number was significantly reduced in cd (7.7 +/- 3.7, mean +/- sd) and uc (9.0 +/- 3.0) compared to hc (11.9 +/- 2.2) (p=0.0005). the simpson d index of alpha diversity was not significantly different between the three groups. total numbers of c. leptum group bacteria and f. prausnitzii were reduced in both cd and uc compared to hc (p=0.0036 and p<0.0001 respectively). disease activity did not influence numbers of c. leptum or f. prausnitzii in patients with cd or uc. conclusion: c. leptum numbers and diversity were significantly reduced in both cd and uc suggesting that alterations noted were not specific to one disease. this could contribute to reduced short chain fatty acid production in ibd.

TI  == a diet high in resistant starch modulates microbiota composition, scfa concentrations, and gene expression in pig intestine.
AB  == resistant starch (rs) is highly fermentable by microbiota in the colon, resulting in the production of scfas. rs is thought to mediate a large proportion of its health benefits, including increased satiety, through the actions of scfas. the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a diet high in rs on luminal  microbiota composition, luminal scfa concentrations, and the expression of host genes involved in scfa uptake, scfa signaling, and satiety regulation in mucosal  tissue obtained from small intestine, cecum, and colon. twenty adult female pigs  were either assigned to a digestible starch (ds) diet or a diet high in rs (34%)  for a period of 2 wk. after the intervention, luminal content and mucosal scrapings were obtained for detailed molecular analysis. rs was completely degraded in the cecum. in both the cecum and colon, differences in microbiota composition were observed between ds- and rs-fed pigs. in the colon these included the stimulation of the healthy gut-associated butyrate-producing faecalibacterium prausnitzii, whereas potentially pathogenic members of the gammaproteobacteria, including escherichia coli and pseudomonas spp., were reduced in relative abundance. cecal and colonic scfa concentrations were significantly greater in rs-fed pigs, and cecal gene expression of monocarboxylate transporter 1 (slc16a1) and glucagon (gcg) was induced by rs. in  conclusion, our data show that rs modulates microbiota composition, scfa concentrations, and host gene expression in pig intestine. combined, our data provide an enhanced understanding of the interaction between diet, microbiota, and host.

TI  == decreased abundance of faecalibacterium prausnitzii in the gut microbiota of crohn's disease.
AB  == background and aims: dysbiosis is thought to be relevant to the etiology and pathogenesis of crohn's disease (cd). in this study, we investigated the abundance of faecalibacterium prausnitzii, as well as bilophila wadsworthia, in the gut microbiota of japanese cd patients. methods: forty-seven cd patients and  20 healthy controls were enrolled. abundance of f. prausnitzii in fecal samples was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. the gut microbiota profile was evaluated by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms. results: the abundance of f. prausnitzii significantly decreased in cd patients compared with  healthy subjects. b. wadsworthia was scarcely detected in the same samples. among cd patients, the crohn's disease activity index, c-reactive protein levels, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were significantly lower, and serum albumin levels were significantly higher in the high f. prausnitzii group compared with the low  group. terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms analysis showed that fecal bacterial communities of cd patients differed from those of healthy individuals. the changes in simulated bacterial composition indicated that class  clostridia, including genus faecalibacterium, was significantly less abundant in  cd patients as compared with healthy individuals. the bacterial diversity measured by the shannon diversity index was significantly reduced in cd patients  compared with healthy individuals. conclusion: the decreased abundance of class clostridia, including f. prausnitzii, may translate into a reduction of commensal bacteria-mediated, anti-inflammatory activities in the mucosa, which are relevant to the pathophysiology of cd. in contrast, the role of b. wadsworthia was suspected to be minimal.

TI  == insight into the prebiotic concept: lessons from an exploratory, double blind intervention study with inulin-type fructans in obese women.
AB  == objective: to highlight the contribution of the gut microbiota to the modulation  of host metabolism by dietary inulin-type fructans (itf prebiotics) in obese women. methods: a double blind, placebo controlled, intervention study was performed with 30 obese women treated with itf prebiotics (inulin/oligofructose 50/50 mix; n=15) or placebo (maltodextrin; n=15) for 3 months (16 g/day). blood,  faeces and urine sampling, oral glucose tolerance test, homeostasis model assessment and impedancemetry were performed before and after treatment. the gut  microbial composition in faeces was analysed by phylogenetic microarray and qpcr  analysis of 16s rdna. plasma and urine metabolic profiles were analysed by 1h-nmr spectroscopy. results: treatment with itf prebiotics, but not the placebo, led to an increase in bifidobacterium and faecalibacterium prausnitzii; both bacteria negatively correlated with serum lipopolysaccharide levels. itf prebiotics also decreased bacteroides intestinalis, bacteroides vulgatus and propionibacterium, an effect associated with a slight decrease in fat mass and with plasma lactate and phosphatidylcholine levels. no clear treatment clustering could be detected for gut microbial analysis or plasma and urine metabolomic profile analyses. however, itf prebiotics led to subtle changes in the gut microbiota that may importantly impact on several key metabolites implicated in obesity and/or diabetes. conclusions: itf prebiotics selectively changed the gut microbiota composition in obese women, leading to modest changes in host metabolism, as suggested by the correlation between some bacterial species and metabolic endotoxaemia or metabolomic signatures.

TI  == in vitro fermentation of commercial alpha-gluco-oligosaccharide by faecal microbiota from lean and obese human subjects.
AB  == the fermentation selectivity of a commercial source of a-gluco-oligosaccharides (bioecolians; solabia) was investigated in vitro. fermentation by faecal bacteria from four lean and four obese healthy adults was determined in anaerobic, ph-controlled faecal batch cultures. inulin was used as a positive prebiotic control. samples were obtained at 0, 10, 24 and 36 h for bacterial enumeration by fluorescent in situ hybridisation and scfa analyses. gas production during fermentation was investigated in non-ph-controlled batch cultures. a-gluco-oligosaccharides significantly increased the bifidobacterium sp. population compared with the control. other bacterial groups enumerated were unaffected with the exception of an increase in the bacteroides-prevotella group  and a decrease in faecalibacterium prausnitzii on both a-gluco-oligosaccharides and inulin compared with baseline. an increase in acetate and propionate was seen on both substrates. the fermentation of a-gluco-oligosaccharides produced less total gas at a more gradual rate of production than inulin. generally, substrates fermented with the obese microbiota produced similar results to the lean fermentation regarding bacteriology and metabolic activity. no significant difference at baseline (0 h) was detected between the lean and obese individuals  in any of the faecal bacterial groups studied.

TI  == microbiota of de-novo pediatric ibd: increased faecalibacterium prausnitzii and reduced bacterial diversity in crohn's but not in ulcerative colitis.
AB  == objectives: the gastrointestinal microbiota is considered important in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) pathogenesis. discoveries from established disease cohorts report reduced bacterial diversity, changes in bacterial composition, and a protective role for faecalibacterium prausnitzii in crohn's disease (cd). the majority of studies to date are however potentially confounded  by the effect of treatment and a reliance on established rather than de-novo disease. methods: microbial changes at diagnosis were examined by biopsying the colonic mucosa of 37 children: 25 with newly presenting, untreated ibd with active colitis (13 cd and 12 ulcerative colitis (uc)), and 12 pediatric controls  with a macroscopically and microscopically normal colon. we utilized a dual-methodology approach with pyrosequencing (threshold >10,000 reads) and confirmatory real-time pcr (rt-pcr). results: threshold pyrosequencing output was obtained on 34 subjects (11 cd, 11 uc, 12 controls). no significant changes were  noted at phylum level among the bacteroidetes, firmicutes, or proteobacteria. a significant reduction in bacterial alpha-diversity was noted in cd vs. controls by three methods (shannon, simpson, and phylogenetic diversity) but not in uc vs. controls. an increase in faecalibacterium was observed in cd compared with controls by pyrosequencing (mean 16.7% vs. 9.1% of reads, p=0.02) and replicated  by specific f. prausnitzii rt-pcr (36.0% vs. 19.0% of total bacteria, p=0.02). no disease-specific clustering was evident on principal components analysis. conclusions: our results offer a comprehensive examination of the ibd mucosal microbiota at diagnosis, unaffected by therapeutic confounders or changes over time. our results challenge the current model of a protective role for f. prausnitzii in cd, suggesting a more dynamic role for this organism than previously described.

TI  == metagenomic sequencing of the human gut microbiome before and after bariatric surgery in obese patients with type 2 diabetes: correlation with inflammatory and metabolic parameters.
AB  == roux-en-y gastric bypass (rygb) has become a prominent therapeutic option for long-term treatment of morbid obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2d). cross talk and pathogenetic consequences of rygb-induced profound effects on metabolism and gut microbiome are poorly understood. the aim of the present study therefore  was to characterize intra-individual changes of gut microbial composition before  and 3 months after rygb by metagenomic sequencing in morbidly obese patients (body mass index (bmi)>40 kg m(-)(2)) with t2d. subsequently, metagenomic data were correlated with clinical indices. based on gene relative abundance profile,  1061 species, 729 genera, 44 phyla and 5127 ko (kegg orthology) were identified.  despite high diversity, bacteria could mostly be assigned to seven bacterial divisions. the overall metagenomic rygb-induced shift was characterized by a reduction of firmicutes and bacteroidetes and an increase of proteobacteria. twenty-two microbial species and 11 genera were significantly altered by rygb. using principal component analysis, highly correlated species were assembled into two common components. component 1 consisted of species that were mainly associated with bmi and c-reactive protein. this component was characterized by increased numbers of proteobacterium enterobacter cancerogenus and decreased firmicutes faecalibacterium prausnitzii and coprococcus comes. functional analysis of carbohydrate metabolism by ko revealed significant effects in 13 kos  assigned to phosphotransferase system. spearmen's rank correlation indicated an association of 10 species with plasma total- or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and 5 species with triglycerides. f. prausnitzii was directly correlated to fasting blood glucose. this is the first clinical demonstration of  a profound and specific intra-individual modification of gut microbial composition by full metagenomic sequencing. a clear correlation exists of microbiome composition and gene function with an improvement in metabolic and inflammatory parameters. this will allow to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies based on metagenomic sequencing of the human gut microbiome.

TI  == sensitivity of pathogenic and commensal bacteria from the human colon to essential oils.
AB  == the microbiota of the intestinal tract plays an important role in colonic health, mediating many effects of dietary components on colonic health and during enteric infections. in the context of the increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance in gut bacteria, complementary therapies are required for the prevention and treatment of enteric infections. here we report the potential application of essential oils (eo) and pure eo compounds to improve human gut health. nerolidol, thymol, eugenol and geraniol inhibited growth of the pathogens escherichia coli o157 : h7(vt(-)), clostridium difficile dsm1296, clostridium perfringens dsm11780, salmonella typhimurium 3530 and salmonella enteritidis s1400 at a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) varying from 50 to 500 p.p.m. most eo showed greater toxicity to pathogens than to commensals. however, the beneficial commensal faecalibacterium prausnitzii was sensitive to eo at similar  or even lower concentrations than the pathogens. the eo showed dose-dependent effects on cell integrity, as measured using propidium iodide, of gram-positive bacteria. these effects were not strongly correlated with growth inhibition, however, suggesting that cell membrane damage occurred but was not the primary cause of growth inhibition. growth inhibition of gram-negative bacteria, in contrast, occurred mostly without cell integrity loss. principal component analysis showed clustering of responses according to bacterial species rather than to the identity of the eo, with the exception that responses to thymol and nerolidol clustered away from the other eo. in conclusion, the selective effects  of some eo might have beneficial effects on gut health if chosen carefully for effectiveness against different species.

AB  == we tested the hypothesis that crohn's disease (cd)-related genetic polymorphisms  involved in host innate immunity are associated with shifts in human ileum-associated microbial composition in a cross-sectional analysis of human ileal samples. sanger sequencing of the bacterial 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene and 454 sequencing of 16s rrna gene hypervariable regions (v1-v3 and v3-v5), were conducted on macroscopically disease-unaffected ileal biopsies collected from 52  ileal cd, 58 ulcerative colitis and 60 control patients without inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd) undergoing initial surgical resection. these subjects also were genotyped for the three major nod2 risk alleles (leu1007fs, r708w, g908r) and the atg16l1 risk allele (t300a). the samples were linked to clinical metadata, including body mass index, smoking status and clostridia difficile infection. the sequences were classified into seven phyla/subphyla categories using the naive bayesian classifier of the ribosome database project. centered log ratio transformation of six predominant categories was included as the dependent variable in the permutation based mancova for the overall composition with stepwise variable selection. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays were conducted to measure the relative frequencies of the clostridium coccoides - eubacterium rectales group and the faecalibacterium prausnitzii spp. empiric logit transformations of the relative frequencies of these two microbial groups were included in permutation-based ancova. regardless of sequencing method, ibd phenotype, clostridia difficile and nod2 genotype were selected as associated (fdr </= 0.05) with shifts in overall microbial composition. ibd phenotype and nod2 genotype were also selected as associated with shifts in the relative frequency of the c. coccoides--e. rectales group. ibd phenotype, smoking and ibd  medications were selected as associated with shifts in the relative frequency of  f. prausnitzii spp. these results indicate that the effects of genetic and environmental factors on ibd are mediated at least in part by the enteric microbiota.

TI  == unbalance of intestinal microbiota in atopic children.
AB  == background: playing a strategic role in the host immune function, the intestinal  microbiota has been recently hypothesized to be involved in the etiology of atopy. in order to investigate the gastrointestinal microbial ecology of atopic disease, here we performed a pilot comparative molecular analysis of the faecal microbiota in atopic children and healthy controls. results: nineteen atopic children and 12 healthy controls aged 4-14 years were enrolled. stools were collected and the faecal microbiota was characterized by means of the already developed phylogenetic microarray platform, htf-microbi.array, and quantitative pcr. the intestinal microbiota of atopic children showed a significant depletion  in members of the clostridium cluster iv, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, akkermansia muciniphila and a corresponding increase of the relative abundance of enterobacteriaceae. conclusion: depleted in key immunomodulatory symbionts, the atopy-associated microbiota can represent an inflammogenic microbial consortium which can contribute to the severity of the disease. our data open the way to the therapeutic manipulation of the intestinal microbiota in the treatment of atopy by means of pharmaceutical probiotics.

TI  == 454 pyrosequencing reveals a shift in fecal microbiota of healthy adult men consuming polydextrose or soluble corn fiber.
AB  == the relative contribution of novel fibers such as polydextrose and soluble corn fiber (scf) to the human gut microbiome and its association with host physiology  has not been well studied. this study was conducted to test the impact of polydextrose and scf on the composition of the human gut microbiota using 454 pyrosequencing and to identify associations among fecal microbiota and fermentative end-products. healthy adult men (n = 20) with a mean dietary fiber (df) intake of 14 g/d were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. participants consumed 3 treatment snack bars/d during each 21-d period that contained no supplemental fiber (nfc), polydextrose (pdx; 21 g/d), or scf (21 g/d) for 21 d. there were no washout periods. fecal samples were collected on d 16-21 of each period; dna was extracted, followed by amplification of the v4-v6 region of the 16s rrna gene using barcoded primers. pdx and scf significantly affected the relative abundance of bacteria at the class, genus, and species level. the consumption of pdx and scf led to greater fecal clostridiaceae and veillonellaceae and lower eubacteriaceae compared with a nfc. the abundance of faecalibacterium, phascolarctobacterium, and dialister was greater (p < 0.05) in response to pdx and scf intake, whereas lactobacillus was greater (p < 0.05) only after scf intake. faecalibacterium prausnitzii, well known for its antiinflammatory properties, was greater (p < 0.05) after fiber consumption. principal component analysis clearly indicated a distinct clustering of individuals consuming supplemental fibers. our data demonstrate a beneficial shift in the gut microbiome of adults consuming pdx and scf, with potential application as prebiotics.

TI  == how can faecalibacterium prausnitzii employ riboflavin for extracellular electron transfer?
AB  == faecalibacterium prausnitzii is one of the most abundant commensal microbes in the human gut. it is an important supplier of butyrate to the colonic epithelium, and low numbers of faecalibacteria have been associated with severe inflammatory  bowel disease. previous studies revealed that f. prausnitzii shuttles electrons extracellularly to oxygen in systems containing flavins and thiols. since this electron shuttling to oxygen strongly stimulates growth, the present studies were aimed at elucidating the role of riboflavin as an extracellular electronophore of f. prausnitzii. we show that f. prausnitzii can use riboflavin as a mediator for  extracellular electron transfer (eet) to the anode of microbial fuel cell systems. however, this bacterium relies on exogenous riboflavin, since it does not secrete this compound as shown by the analysis of a spent growth medium using cyclic voltammetry (cv). importantly, cv showed that riboflavin can undergo fully reversible redox cycling under physiologically relevant conditions. lastly, riboflavin is shown to mediate the electrochemical oxidation of the main bacterial reducing equivalent nadh. based on our present observations, we hypothesize that riboflavin is of major importance as a redox mediator for bacterial eet and growth in the human gut.

TI  == molecular-phylogenetic characterization of the microbiota in ulcerated and non-ulcerated regions in the patients with crohn's disease.
AB  == background: the dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota has been established in crohn's disease (cd), but the molecular characterization of this dysbiosis in chinese subjects with cd remains unclear. this study aims to investigate the predominant bacterial composition of the faecal and mucosal-associated microbiota in chinese cd patients using culture-independent techniques. methods/principal findings: eighteen patients with cd and 9 healthy controls were included in this  study. the faeces and the intestinal mucosal tissues from the ulcerated and nonulcerated sites were subjected to bacterial community fingerprinting using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). the predominant bacterial composition in the faeces and mucosa was determined with dna sequencing and blast. we showed that the bacterial diversity in the faeces of cd patients was reduced compared with that in healthy controls (p<0.01). the faecal bacterial dysbiosis of the patients was characterized by an elevated abundance of gamma-proteobacteria (especially escherichia coli and shigella flexneri) and a reduced proportion of bacteroidetes and firmicutes. five bacterial species defined the microbiota imbalance of the ulcerated mucosa in cd, including an increase in escherichia coli, a decrease in faecalibacterium prausnitzii, lactobacillus coleohominis, bacteroides sp and streptococcus gallolyticus in the  bacterial community as compared with the nonulcerated (p<0.01). conclusions/significance: this is the first description of intestinal microbiota  dysbiosis in chinese cd patients. these results allow a better understanding of the faecal and mucosal microbiota in cd, showing a predominance of some opportunistic pathogenic bacteria and a decrease in beneficial bacterial species. the findings may provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of cd in chinese population.

TI  == mucosa-associated bacteria in two middle-aged women diagnosed with collagenous colitis.
AB  == aim: to characterize the colon microbiota in two women histologically diagnosed with collagenous colitis using a culture-independent method. methods: biopsies were taken from the ascending colon and the total dna was extracted. universal bacterial primers were used to amplify the bacterial 16s rrna genes. the amplicons were then cloned into competent escherichia coli cells. the clones were sequenced and identified by comparison to known sequences. results: the clones could be divided into 44 different phylotypes. the microbiota was dominated by firmicutes and bacteroidetes. seven phylotypes were found in both patients and constituted 47.5% of the total number of clones. of these, the most dominating were clones similar to bacteroides cellulosilyticus, bacteroides caccae, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides dorei within  bacteroidetes. sequences similar to faecalibacterium prausnitzii and clostridium  citroniae were also found in both patients. conclusion: a predominance of potentially pathogenic bacteroides spp., and the presence of clones showing similarity to clostridium clostridioforme were found but the overall colon microbiota showed similarities to a healthy one. etiologies for collagenous colitis other than an adverse bacterial flora must also be considered.

TI  == the antimicrobial action of chitosan, low molar mass chitosan, and chitooligosaccharides on human colonic bacteria.
AB  == antibacterial effect of chitooligosaccharides (cos) and low molar mass chitosans  (lmwc) is considered as one of the most important characteristics of chitosan (cs) hydrolysates. here, we show the in vitro effect of different cos, lmwc, and  cs on representative anaerobic bacteria isolated from human colon as a possibility of targeting modification of colonic microflora composition by supplementation of dietary cs products by humans. specific growth rate of seven selected nonpathogenic anaerobic bacterial strains (clostridium paraputrificum, clostridium beijerinckii, roseburia intestinalis, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteriodes thetaiotaomicron, faecalibacterium prausnitzii and blautia coccoides) was determined in the presence of 0.25 and 0.5% cos (2, 3, and 6 kda), 0.025 and  0.05% of lmwc (10 and 16 kda), and 0.025 and 0.1% of cs in vitro. the growth rate decreased in all strains in the presence of cos and lmwc in higher concentrations in comparison to control incubations. a relatively higher resistance to cs hydrolyzates was detected in r. intestinalis and f. prausnitzii, and more susceptible were bacteria belonging to bacteoides sp. and clostridium sp. the antimicrobial activity, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic), and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc) were determined. the antimicrobial activity increased with the degree of polymerization (dp). mic ranged from 0.25 to 4.5% in dependence on bacterial strain and dp of cs/lmwc. mbc also decreased with dp. the most effective antimicrobial action was detected in lmwc with 16 kda and cs. weak antimicrobial activity was found in cos with small molecules (2 and 3 kda).

TI  == the type and quantity of dietary fat and carbohydrate alter faecal microbiome and short-chain fatty acid excretion in a metabolic syndrome 'at-risk' population.
AB  == introduction and objectives: an obese-type human microbiota with an increased firmicutes:bacteroidetes ratio has been described that may link the gut microbiome with obesity and metabolic syndrome (mets) development. dietary fat and carbohydrate are modifiable risk factors that may impact on mets by altering  the human microbiome composition. we determined the effect of the amount and type of dietary fat and carbohydrate on faecal bacteria and short chain fatty acid (scfa) concentrations in people 'at risk' of mets. design: a total of 88 subjects at increased mets risk were fed a high saturated fat diet (hs) for 4 weeks (baseline), then randomised onto one of the five experimental diets for 24 weeks: hs; high monounsaturated fat (mufa)/high glycemic index (gi) (hm/hgi); high mufa/low gi (hm/lgi); high carbohydrate (cho)/high gi (hc/hgi); and high cho/low  gi (hc/lgi). dietary intakes, mets biomarkers, faecal bacteriology and scfa concentrations were monitored. results: high mufa diets did not affect individual bacterial population numbers but reduced total bacteria and plasma total and ldl-cholesterol. the low fat, hc diets increased faecal bifidobacterium (p=0.005, for hc/hgi; p=0.052, for hc/lgi) and reduced fasting glucose and cholesterol compared to baseline. hc/hgi also increased faecal bacteroides (p=0.038), whereas hc/lgi and hs increased faecalibacterium prausnitzii (p=0.022 for hc/hgi and p=0.018, for hs). importantly, changes in faecal bacteroides numbers correlated inversely with body weight (r=-0.64). a total bacteria reduction was observed for high fat diets hm/hgi and hm/lgi (p=0.023 and p=0.005, respectively) and hs increased faecal scfa concentrations (p<0.01). conclusion: this study provides new evidence from a large-scale dietary intervention study that hc diets, irrespective of gi, can modulate human faecal saccharolytic bacteria, including bacteroides and bifidobacteria. conversely, high fat diets reduced bacterial numbers, and in the hs diet, increased excretion of scfa, which may suggest a compensatory mechanism to eliminate excess dietary energy.

TI  == the gut anaerobe faecalibacterium prausnitzii uses an extracellular electron shuttle to grow at oxic-anoxic interphases.
AB  == faecalibacterium prausnitzii is one of the most abundant bacteria in the human gut ecosystem and it is an important supplier of butyrate to the colonic epithelium. low numbers of faecalibacteria have been associated with inflammatory bowel disease. despite being extremely oxygen sensitive, f. prausnitzii is found  adherent to the gut mucosa where oxygen diffuses from epithelial cells. this paradox is now explained on the basis of gas tube experiments, flavin-dependent reduction of 5,5'-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoate and microbial fuel cell experiments.  the results show that f. prausnitzii employs an extracellular electron shuttle of flavins and thiols to transfer electrons to oxygen. both compounds are present in the healthy human gut. our observations may have important implications for the treatment of patients with crohn's disease, for example, with flavin- or antioxidant rich diets, and they provide a novel key insight in host-microbe interactions at the gut barrier.

TI  == increase in fecal primary bile acids and dysbiosis in patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.
AB  == background: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a multifactorial disease for which  a dysbiosis of the gut microbiota has been described. bile acids (ba) could play  a role as they are endogenous laxatives and are metabolized by gut microbiota. we compared fecal ba profiles and microbiota in healthy subjects (hs) and patients with diarrhea-predominant ibs (ibs-d), and we searched for an association with symptoms. methods: clinical features and stool samples were collected in ibs-d patients and hs. fecal ba profiles were generated using hplc coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. the fecal microbiota composition was assessed by q-pcr targeting dominant bacterial groups and species implicated in ba transformation.  key results: fourteen ibs-d patients and 18 hs were included. the two groups were comparable in terms of age and sex. the percentage of fecal primary ba was significantly higher in ibs-d patients than in hs, and it was significantly correlated with stool consistency and frequency. fecal counts of all bacteria, lactobacillus, coccoides, leptum and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were similar. there was a significant increase of escherichia coli and a significant decrease of leptum and bifidobacterium in ibs-d patients. conclusions & inferences: we report an increase of primary ba in the feces of ibs-d patients compared to hs, correlated with stool consistency and frequency. a dysbiosis of different bacterial groups was detected, some of them involved in ba transformation. as the gut microbiota is the exclusive pathway to transform primary into secondary ba, this suggests a functional consequence of dysbiosis, leading to lower ba transformation.

TI  == cultured representatives of two major phylogroups of human colonic faecalibacterium prausnitzii can utilize pectin, uronic acids, and host-derived substrates for growth.
AB  == faecalibacterium prausnitzii is one of the most abundant commensal bacteria in the healthy human large intestine, but information on genetic diversity and substrate utilization is limited. here, we examine the phylogeny, phenotypic characteristics, and influence of gut environmental factors on growth of f. prausnitzii strains isolated from healthy subjects. phylogenetic analysis based on the 16s rrna sequences indicated that the cultured strains were representative of f. prausnitzii sequences detected by direct analysis of fecal dna and separated the available isolates into two phylogroups. most f. prausnitzii strains tested grew well under anaerobic conditions on apple pectin. furthermore, f. prausnitzii strains competed successfully in coculture with two other abundant pectin-utilizing species, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and eubacterium eligens, with apple pectin as substrate, suggesting that this species makes a contribution to pectin fermentation in the colon. many f. prausnitzii isolates were able to utilize uronic acids for growth, an ability previously thought to be confined to  bacteroides spp. among human colonic anaerobes. most strains grew on n-acetylglucosamine, demonstrating an ability to utilize host-derived substrates. all strains tested were bile sensitive, showing at least 80% growth inhibition in the presence of 0.5 mug/ml bile salts, while inhibition at mildly acidic ph was strain dependent. these attributes help to explain the abundance of f. prausnitzii in the colonic community but also suggest factors in the gut environment that may limit its distribution.

TI  == decreased colonization of fecal clostridium coccoides/eubacterium rectale species from ulcerative colitis patients in an in vitro dynamic gut model with mucin environment.
AB  == the mucus layer in the colon, acting as a barrier to prevent invasion of pathogens, is thinner and discontinuous in patients with ulcerative colitis (uc). a recent developed in vitro dynamic gut model, the m-shime, was used to compare long-term colonization of the mucin layer by the microbiota from six healthy volunteers (hv) and six uc patients and thus distinguish the mucin adhered from the luminal microbiota. although under the same nutritional conditions, short-chain fatty acid production by the luminal communities from uc patients showed a tendency toward a lower butyrate production. a more in-depth community analysis of those microbial groups known to produce butyrate revealed that the diversity of the clostridium coccoides/eubacterium rectale and clostridium leptum group, and counts of faecalibacterium prausnitzii were lower in the luminal fractions of the uc samples. counts of roseburia spp. were lower in the mucosal fractions of the uc samples. qpcr analysis for butyryl-coa:acetate coa transferase, responsible for butyrate production, displayed a lower abundance in  both the luminal and mucosal fractions of the uc samples. the m-shime model revealed depletion in butyrate producing microbial communities not restricted to  the luminal but also in the mucosal samples from uc patients compared to hv.

TI  == high-level dietary fibre up-regulates colonic fermentation and relative abundance of saccharolytic bacteria within the human faecal microbiota in vitro.
AB  == background: health authorities around the world advise citizens to increase their intake of foods rich in dietary fibre because of its inverse association with chronic disease. however, a few studies have measured the impact of increasing mixed dietary fibres directly on the composition of the human gut microbiota. aims of the study: we studied the impact of high-level mixed dietary fibre intake on the human faecal microbiota using an in vitro three-stage colonic model. methods: the colonic model was maintained on three levels of fibre, a basal level of dietary fibre, typical of a western-style diet, a threefold increased level and back to normal level. bacterial profiles and short chain fatty acids concentrations were measured. results: high-level dietary fibre treatment significantly stimulated the growth of bifidobacterium, lactobacillus-enterococcus group, and ruminococcus group (p < 0.05) and significantly increased clostridial cluster xiva and faecalibacterium prausnitzii in vessel 1 mimicking the proximal colon (p < 0.05). total short chain fatty acids concentrations increased significantly upon increased fibre fermentation, with acetate and butyrate increasing significantly in vessel 1 only (p < 0.05). bacterial species richness changed upon increased fibre supplementation. the microbial community and fermentation output returned to initial levels once supplementation with high fibre ceased. conclusions: this study shows that high-level mixed dietary fibre intake can up-regulate both colonic fermentation and the relative abundance of saccharolytic bacteria within the human colonic microbiota. considering the important role of short chain fatty acids in regulating human energy metabolism, this study has implications for the health-promoting potential of foods rich in dietary fibres.

AB  == background: altered intestinal dendritic cell (dc) function underlies dysregulated t-cell responses to bacteria in crohn's disease (cd) but it is unclear whether composition of the intestinal microbiota impacts local dc function. we assessed the relationship between dc function with disease activity  and intestinal microbiota in patients with cd. methods: surface expression of toll-like receptor (tlr)-2, tlr-4, and spontaneous intracellular interleukin (il)-10, il-12p40, il-6 production by freshly isolated dc were analyzed by multicolor flow cytometry of cells extracted from rectal tissue of 10 controls and 28 cd patients. myeloid dc were identified as cd11c(+) hla-dr(+lin-/dim) cells (lin = anti-cd3, cd14, cd16, cd19, cd34). intestinal microbiota were analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization of fecal samples with oligonucleotide probes targeting 16s rrna of bifidobacteria, bacteroides-prevotella, c. coccoides-e. rectale, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii. results: dc from cd produced higher amounts of il-12p40 and il-6 than control dc. il-6(+) dc were associated with the cd activity index (r = 0.425; p = 0.024) and serum c-reactive protein (crp) (r = 0.643; p = 0.004). dc expression of tlr-4 correlated with disease activity. il-12p40(+) dc correlated with ratio of bacteroides: bifidobacteria (r = 0.535, p = 0.003). il-10(+) dc correlated with bifidobacteria, and il-6(+) dc correlated negatively with f. prausnitzii (r = -0.50; p = 0.008). the amount of tlr-4 on dc correlated negatively with the concentration of f. prausnitzii. conclusions: il-6 production by intestinal dc is increased in cd and correlates with disease activity and crp. bacterially driven local il-6 production by intestinal dc may overcome regulatory activity, resulting in unopposed effector function and tissue damage. intestinal  dc function may be influenced by the composition of the commensal microbiota.

TI  == [specificity comparison of three feacalibacterium prausnitzii-specific pcr primer pairs].
AB  == objective: to compare the specificity of three 16s rrna gene-based pcr primer pairs (fpr-1/fpr-2, fpr-2f/fprau645r and fprau223f/fprau420r), which are used to  specifically detect and quantify the important human gut bacterium feacalibacterium prausnitzii. methods: clustal x was used to align the sequences  of individual primer and the 16s rrna gene of f. prausnitzii and other bacteria.  the number of faecalibacterium spp. sequences in ribosomal database project (rdp) matched by each primer was obtained by the probe match tool. with the full-length 16s rrna gene clone library constructed by our laboratory which contained 7255 clones from the gut microbiota of 7 chinese people, the simulated pcr (spcr) program was applied to predict the clone number of f. prausnitzii and other gut bacteria matched by every primer pair; pcr amplification was performed with three primer pairs and representative clones to verify the spcr prediction. real-time quantitative pcr was performed with three primer pairs, respectively, for fecal samples from 14 healthy individuals. results: the first base at the 3' end of fprau645r showed the highest mismatch level for non-f. prausnitzii bacteria. the  percentage of the number of faecalibacterium spp. sequences matched by fprau645r  accounting for that of matched bacteria sequences in the rdp database was 97.6%,  which was significantly higher than that of other primers. as spcr predicted, all three primer pairs can detect about 1171 clones from f. prausnitzii; the clones of non-faecalibacterium spp. detected by fpr-2f/fprau645r mainly were subdoligranulum spp. , but the non-faecalibacterium spp. clones detected by fpr-1/fpr-2 and fprau223f/fprau420r were mainly subdoligranulum spp., oscillibacter spp. , ruminococcus spp. and unclassified ruminococcaceae etc. the  real pcr showed the same results with spcr. the real-time quantitative pcr showed fpr-1/fpr-2 and fprau223f/fprau420r detected more bacteria than fpr-2f/fprau645r. conclusion: the three primer pairs can detect f. prausnitzii and subdoligranulum  spp., however, the specificity of fpr-2f/fprau645r is better than fpr-1/fpr-2 and fprau223f/fprau420r.

TI  == identification and characterization of potential performance-related gut microbiotas in broiler chickens across various feeding trials.
AB  == three broiler feeding trials were investigated in order to identify gut bacteria  consistently linked with improvements in bird performance as measured by feed efficiency. trials were done in various geographic locations and varied in diet composition, broiler breed, and bird age. gut microbial communities were investigated using microbial profiling. eight common performance-linked operational taxonomic units (otus) were identified within both the ilea (180, 492, and 564-566) and ceca (140-142, 218-220, 284-286, 312, and 482) across trials. otu 564-566 was associated with lower performance, while otus 140-142, 482, and 492 were associated with improved performance. targeted cloning and sequencing of these eight otus revealed that they represented 26 bacterial species or phylotypes which clustered phylogenetically into seven groups related  to lactobacillus spp., ruminococcaceae, clostridiales, gammaproteobacteria, bacteroidales, clostridiales/lachnospiraceae, and unclassified bacteria/clostridia. where bacteria were identifiable to the phylum level, they belonged predominantly to the firmicutes, with bacteroidetes and proteobacteria also identified. some of the potential performance-related phylotypes showed high sequence identity with classified bacteria (lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus aviarius, lactobacillus crispatus, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, escherichia coli, gallibacterium anatis, clostridium lactatifermentans, ruminococcus torques, bacteroides vulgatus, and alistipes finegoldii). the 16s rrna gene sequence information generated will allow quantitative assays to be developed which will enable elucidations of which of these phylotypes are truly performance related. this information could be used to monitor strategies to improve feed efficiency and feed formulation for optimal gut health.

TI  == bacteria as trigger for chronic gastrointestinal disorders.
AB  == apart from acute infections, microorganisms may also induce or perpetuate chronic inflammatory diseases and reversible or irreversible proliferation of various cells in the gastrointestinal tract (the extreme being adenocarcinoma and lymphoma). helicobacter pylori is not only involved in the pathogenesis of lymphoma and gastric adenocarcinoma. the steps and mechanisms of the carcinogenic process involve host predisposition, environmental factors, and strain virulence. the steps of lymphoma genesis include chronic inflammation, acquisition of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue in the stomach, proliferation of the b lymphocytes in an inflammatory context, acquisition of genetic anomalies and dysregulation of the nf-kappab pathway. the role of campylobacter jejuni in immunoproliferative small bowel disease has also been shown and eradication of this bacterium can cure the lymphoma at its early stage. the evidence for the role of some bacteria in colon cancer development is discussed. opportunistic pathogens are detected in the stools or mucosa of a proportion of subjects with crohn's disease. they include mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis, adherent invasive escherichia coli, and clostridium difficile. a dysbiosis has been repeatedly observed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. instability of the dominant microbiota and decreased biodiversity (especially in the firmicutes  phylum) are major characteristics. the decrease of faecalibacterium prausnitzii seems to have a prognostic value to predict relapse of crohn's disease after surgery. finally, important perspectives are opened by new tools such as metagenomics and metabolomics of the gastrointestinal ecosystems. major tracks concern irritable bowel syndrome, colon cancer and obesity.

TI  == diversity of the autochthonous colonic microbiota.
AB  == a longstanding hypothesis in intestinal microbial ecology is that autochthonous microbes (resident) play a role that is distinct from allochthonous microbes (transient microbes in the fecal stream). a challenge has been to identify this pool of microbes. we used laser capture microdissection to collect microbes from  the mouse ascending colon. this area contains transverse folds that mimic human intestinal folds and contains a distinct population of intestinal microbes that is associated with the mucosa. our analysis of bacterial 16s rrna genes showed that this area was enriched for lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae. in this addendum, we further compare this community to studies of mucosa-associated microbes in humans. this analysis reveals common phylogenetic groups of bacteria  that are present in both mouse and human. however, we found microorganisms at the genus and species levels including faecalibacterium prausnitzii which appears to  be specific for humans. we propose that that examination of the mucosa-associated microbes in wild type and genetically modified mice will be a valuable component  to define host microbial interactions that are essential for homeostasis.

TI  == in vitro fermentation of linear and alpha-1,2-branched dextrans by the human fecal microbiota.
AB  == the role of structure and molecular weight in fermentation selectivity in linear  alpha-1,6 dextrans and dextrans with alpha-1,2 branching was investigated. fermentation by gut bacteria was determined in anaerobic, ph-controlled fecal batch cultures after 36 h. inulin (1%, wt/vol), which is a known prebiotic, was used as a control. samples were obtained at 0, 10, 24, and 36 h of fermentation for bacterial enumeration by fluorescent in situ hybridization and short-chain fatty acid analyses. the gas production of the substrate fermentation was investigated in non-ph-controlled, fecal batch culture tubes after 36 h. linear and branched 1-kda dextrans produced significant increases in bifidobacterium populations. the degree of alpha-1,2 branching did not influence the bifidobacterium populations; however, alpha-1,2 branching increased the dietary fiber content, implying a decrease in digestibility. other measured bacteria were unaffected by the test substrates except for the bacteroides-prevotella group, the growth levels of which were increased on inulin and 6- and 70-kda dextrans, and the faecalibacterium prausnitzii group, the growth levels of which were decreased on inulin and 1-kda dextrans. a considerable increase in short-chain fatty acid concentration was measured following the fermentation of all dextrans  and inulin. gas production rates were similar among all dextrans tested but were  significantly slower than that for inulin. the linear 1-kda dextran produced lower total gas and shorter time to attain maximal gas production compared to those of the 70-kda dextran (branched) and inulin. these findings indicate that dextrans induce a selective effect on the gut flora, short-chain fatty acids, and gas production depending on their length.

TI  == bacteroides uniformis is a putative bacterial species associated with the degradation of the isoflavone genistein in human feces.
AB  == inter-individual variation in isoflavone absorption depends on gut microbial degradation and affects the efficacy of these compounds. we hypothesized that inter-individual variation in fecal isoflavone disappearance coincided with variation in bacterial species. in vitro anaerobic fecal disappearance of isoflavones was measured from 33 participants by hplc. fecal microbial 16s rrna variable region pcr products were obtained from 4 participants with the greatest  and least genistein or glycitein degradation and were subjected to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. dna bands with a homology of 90-95% to bacteroides  uniformis and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were present in greater intensities in fecal samples showing a genistein disappearance rate constant of 1.47 +/- 0.14 h(-1) compared with those with a genistein disappearance rate constant of 0.15 +/- 0.03 h(-1) (p < 0.05). human fecal bacterial species with dna sequences 90-100% homologous to tannerella forsythensis and 4 other species were present in greater intensities in fecal samples showing a glycitein disappearance rate constant of 0.57 +/- 0.30 h(-1) compared with fecal samples with a glycitein disappearance rate constant of 0.08 +/- 0.03 h(-1) (p < 0.05). in high degraders, b. uniformis may be a candidate for genistein degradation and t. forsythensis for glycitein degradation, based on fecal isoflavone degradation in the presence of these species. bacteroides acidifaciens increased isoflavone disappearance in anaerobic human fecal incubations under nutrient-rich and -depleted conditions, suggesting this species as one responsible for the generally high degradation of  isoflavones by humans. these fecal microbes are candidate biomarkers for interindividual variation in isoflavone uptake and efficacy.

TI  == microbial dysbiosis in colorectal cancer (crc) patients.
AB  == the composition of the human intestinal microbiota is linked to health status. the aim was to analyze the microbiota of normal and colon cancer patients in order to establish cancer-related dysbiosis. patients and methods: stool bacterial dna was extracted prior to colonoscopy from 179 patients: 60 with colorectal cancer, and 119 with normal colonoscopy. bacterial genes obtained by pyrosequencing of 12 stool samples (6 normal and 6 cancer) were subjected to a validated principal component analysis (pca) test. the dominant and subdominant bacterial population (c. leptum, c. coccoides, bacteroides/prevotella, lactobacillus/leuconostoc/pediococcus groups, bifidobacterium genus, and e. coli, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii species) were quantified in all individuals using qpcr and specific il17 producer cells in the intestinal mucosa were characterized using immunohistochemistry. findings: pyrosequencing (minimal sequence 200 nucleotide reads) revealed 80% of all sequences could be assigned to a total of 819 taxa based on default parameter of classifier software. the phylogenetic core in cancer individuals was different from that in normal individuals according to the pca analysis, with trends towards differences in the dominant and subdominant families of bacteria. consequently, all-bacteria [log(10) (bacteria/g of stool)] in normal, and cancer individuals were similar [11.88+/-0.35, and 11.80+/-0.56, respectively, (p = 0.16)], according to qpcr values whereas among all dominant and subdominant species only those of bacteroides/prevotella were higher (all bacteria-specific bacterium; p = 0.009) in cancer (-1.04+/-0.55) than in normal (-1.40+/-0.83) individuals. il17 immunoreactive cells were significantly expressed more in the normal mucosa of cancer patients than in those with normal colonoscopy. conclusion: this is the first large series to demonstrate a composition change in the microbiota of colon cancer patients with possible impact on mucosal immune response. these data open  new filed for mass screening and pathophysiology investigations.

TI  == intestinal microbiota was assessed in cirrhotic patients with hepatitis b virus infection. intestinal microbiota of hbv cirrhotic patients.
AB  == to unravel the profile of intestinal microecological parameters in chinese patients with asymptomatic carriage of hepatitis b virus (hbv), chronic hepatitis b, decompensated hbv cirrhosis, and health controls and to establish their correlation with liver disease progression, we performed quantitative pcr and immunological techniques to investigate fecal parameters, including population of fecal predominant bacteria and the abundance of some virulence genes derived from escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, and clostridium perfringens in fecal crude dna and some immunological parameters in extracts of all fecal samples. data analysis indicated that 16s rrna gene copy numbers for faecalibacterium prausnitzii, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacteriaceae, bifidobacteria, and lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, and weissella) showed marked variation in the intestine of hbv cirrhotic patients. the bifidobacteria/enterobacteriaceae (b/e) ratio, which may  indicate microbial colonization resistance of the bowel, was decreased significantly in turn from 1.15 +/- 0.11 in healthy controls, 0.99 +/- 0.09 in asymptomatic carriers, and 0.76 +/- 0.08 in patients with chronic hepatitis b to  0.64 +/- 0.09 in patients with decompensated hbv cirrhosis (for all, p < 0.01). this suggests that b/e ratio is useful for following the level of intestinal microecological disorder in the course of liver disease progression. the data for virulence gene abundance suggested increased diversity of virulence factors during liver disease progression. fecal secretory iga and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in decompensated hbv cirrhotic patients were present at higher levels than in other groups, which indicates that a complicated autoregulatory system tries to achieve a new intestinal microecological balance.

TI  == randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of fructo-oligosaccharides in  active crohn's disease.
AB  == introduction: the commensal intestinal microbiota drive the inflammation associated with crohn's disease. however, bacteria such as bifidobacteria and faecalibacterium prausnitzii appear to be immunoregulatory. in healthy subjects the intestinal microbiota are influenced by prebiotic carbohydrates such as fructo-oligosaccharides (fos). preliminary data suggest that fos increase faecal  bifidobacteria, induce immunoregulatory dendritic cell (dc) responses and reduce  disease activity in patients with crohn's disease. aims and methods: to assess the impact of fos in patients with active crohn's disease using an adequately powered randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial with predefined clinical, microbiological and immunological end points. patients with active crohn's disease were randomised to 15 g/day fos or non-prebiotic placebo for 4 weeks. the primary end point was clinical response at week 4 (fall in crohn's disease activity index of >/= 70 points) in the intention-to-treat (itt) population. results: 103 patients were randomised to receive fos (n = 54) or placebo (n = 49). more patients receiving fos (14 (26%) vs 4 (8%); p = 0.018) withdrew before the 4-week end point. there was no significant difference in the  number of patients achieving a clinical response between the fos and placebo groups in the itt analysis (12 (22%) vs 19 (39%), p = 0.067). patients receiving  fos had reduced proportions of interleukin (il)-6-positive lamina propria dc and  increased dc staining of il-10 (p < 0.05) but no change in il-12p40 production. there were no significant differences in the faecal concentration of bifidobacteria and f prausnitzii between the groups at baseline or after the 4-week intervention. conclusion: an adequately powered placebo-controlled trial of fos showed no clinical benefit in patients with active crohn's disease, despite impacting on dc function. isrctn50422530.

TI  == dysbiosis of the faecal microbiota in patients with crohn's disease and their unaffected relatives.
AB  == background and aims: a general dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota has been established in patients with crohn's disease (cd), but a systematic characterisation of this dysbiosis is lacking. therefore the composition of the predominant faecal microbiota of patients with cd was studied in comparison with  the predominant composition in unaffected controls. whether dysbiosis is present  in relatives of patients cd was also examined. methods: focusing on families with at least three members affected with cd, faecal samples of 68 patients with cd, 84 of their unaffected relatives and 55 matched controls were subjected to community fingerprinting of the predominant microbiota using denaturing gradient  gel electrophoresis (dgge). to analyse the dgge profiles, bionumerics software and non-parametric statistical analyses (spss v.17.0) were used. observed differences in the predominant microbiota were subsequently confirmed and quantified with real-time pcr. results: five bacterial species characterised dysbiosis in cd, namely a decrease in dialister invisus (p=0.04), an uncharacterised species of clostridium cluster xiva (p = 0.03), faecalibacterium  prausnitzii (p < 1.3 x 10(-)(5)) and bifidobacterium adolescentis (p = 5.4 x 10(-)(6)), and an increase in ruminococcus gnavus (p = 2.1 x 10(-)(7)). unaffected relatives of patients with cd had less collinsella aerofaciens (p = 0.004) and a member of the escherichia coli-shigella group (p = 0.01) and more ruminococcus torques (p = 0.02) in their predominant microbiota as compared with  healthy subjects. conclusion: unaffected relatives of patients with cd have a different composition of their microbiota compared with healthy controls. this dysbiosis is not characterised by lack of butyrate producing-bacteria as observed in cd but suggests a role for microorganisms with mucin degradation capacity.

TI  == numerical ecology validates a biogeographical distribution and gender-based effect on mucosa-associated bacteria along the human colon.
AB  == we applied constrained ordination numerical ecology methods to data produced with a human intestinal tract-specific phylogenetic microarray (the aus-hit chip) to examine the microbial diversity associated with matched biopsy tissue samples taken from the caecum, transverse colon, sigmoid colon and rectum of 10 healthy patients. consistent with previous studies, the profiles revealed a marked intersubject variability; however, the numerical ecology methods of analysis allowed the subtraction of the subject effect from the data and revealed, for the first time, evidence of a longitudinal gradient for specific microbes along the colorectum. in particular, probes targeting streptococcus and enterococcus spp. produced strongest signals with caecal and transverse colon samples, with a gradual decline through to the rectum. conversely, the analyses suggest that several members of the enterobacteriaceae increase in relative abundance towards  the rectum. these collective differences were substantiated by the multivariate analysis of quantitative pcr data. we were also able to identify differences in the microarray profiles, especially for the streptococci and faecalibacterium prausnitzii, on the basis of gender. the results derived by these multivariate analyses are biologically intuitive and suggest that the biogeography of the colonic mucosa can be monitored for changes through cross-sectional and/or inception cohort studies.

TI  == the role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  == crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc) have features that suggest bacterial involvement, and all genetic models of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) require the presence of commensal bacteria. cd is associated with innate immune response genes such as nod2/card15 and the autophagy genes atg16l1 and irgm. however, ibd responds to immunosuppression, suggesting that any bacteria involved are not acting as conventional pathogens. molecular techniques are rapidly advancing our knowledge of the gut microbiota. in cd there is reduced diversity,  and notably a reduction in the probiotic faecalibacterium prausnitzii, the presence of which in the terminal ileum is associated with a reduced risk of recurrence following surgery. there is also a consistent increase in mucosa-associated escherichia coli with an "adherent and invasive" phenotype, which allows them to replicate inside macrophages and induce granulomas. speculation that cd could be caused by the mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (map) continues. the response to antitumor necrosis factor treatments suggests that, if relevant at all, map is not acting as a conventional pathogen. however, there is increased colonization by map in cd, and there is evidence that it could have an indirect effect mediated by the suppression of macrophage function. uc relapse is frequently associated with infection by pathogens, but there is less evidence for involvement of a specific bacterial species. poor barrier integrity followed by an inflammatory reaction to bacterial components, with chronicity maintained by an autoimmune process, seems a plausible pathogenic model. bacterial theories of pathogenesis are now becoming testable by targeted therapeutic interventions.

AB  == the colonic content can be compared to a spatially structured high output bioreactor composed of three functionally different regions: a separating mucus layer, a germinal stock area, and a central fermenting area. the stool mirrors this structure and can be used for diagnosis in health and disease. in a first part, we introduce a novel method based on fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) of sections of punched-out stool cylinders, which allows quantitatively monitor microbiota in the mucus, the germinal stock and the central fermenting areas. in a second part, we demonstrate the practical implementation of this method, describing the biostructure of stool microbiota in healthy subjects and patients with chronic idiopathic diarrhea treated with saccharomyces boulardii. punched stool cylinders from 20 patients with chronic idiopathic diarrhea and 20  healthy controls were investigated using fluorescence in situ hybridization. seventy-three bacterial groups were evaluated. fluctuations in assembly of 11 constitutive bacterial groups were monitored weekly for 3 weeks prior to, 3 weeks during, and 3 weeks after oral saccharomyces boulardii supplementation. typical findings in healthy subjects were a 5-60 mum mucus separating layer; homogeneous  distribution and fluorescence, high concentrations (>10 x 10(10) bacterial/ml) of the three habitual bacterial groups: bacteroides, roseburia and faecalibacterium  prausnitzii; and low concentrations of the occasional bacterial groups. the diarrhea could be described in terms of increased separating effort, purging, decontamination, bacterial substitution. typical findings in diarrhea were: increased thickness of the protective mucus layer, its incorporation in the stool, absolute reduction in concentrations of the habitual bacterial groups, suppression of bacterial metabolism in the central fermenting area (hybridization silence), stratification of the stool structure by watery ingredients, and substitutive increase in the concentrations of occasional bacterial groups. the microbial and clinical symptoms of diarrhea were reversible with saccharomyces boulardii therapy. the structure-functional analysis of stool microbiota allows to quantitatively monitor colonic malfunction and its response to therapy. saccharomyces boulardii significantly improves the stool biostructure in patients with chronic idiopathic diarrhea and has no influence on the stool microbiota in  healthy subjects.

TI  == [the human intestinal microbiota].
AB  == the human intestinal microbiota constitutes a complex ecosystem which is now well recognized for its impact on human health and well-being. it contributes to maturation of the immune system and provides a direct barrier against colonization by pathogens. its possible implication in diseases of modern societies, currently increasing in prevalence, has been reported. these include allergies, inflammatory bowel diseases and possibly metabolic and degenerative disorders. the analysis of the molecular composition of the human intestinal microbiota indicates marked inter-individual variations which may seem paradoxical considering the high degree of conservation of major functions of the intestinal microbiota such as anaerobic digestion of alimentary fibres. we have characterized a phylogenetic core within the human intestinal microbiota, in terms of composition, i.e., a set of conserved species that could be responsible  for major conserved functions. based on culture-independent molecular assessments, current knowledge enables a definition of criteria qualifying the normal state of the human intestinal microbiota that we call normobiosis. this further enables the identification of specific deviations from normobiosis, i.e., dysbiosis in immune, metabolic or degenerative diseases. notably, crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowel disease of yet unknown aetiology, is associated with intestinal dysbiosis with a lower representation of the clostridium leptum group among the firmicutes phylum. we further showed that the bacterial species faecalibacterium prausnitzii exerts anti-inflammatory properties in vitro and in  animal models; this could explain its ability, when detected in the mucosa-associated microbiota of patients in vivo, to protect patients from post-operative recurrence of endoscopic signs of inflammation 6 months after surgical resection of the ileocecal region of the gut. by confirming the major role of the microbiota in bowel-related disorders, which are especially associated with a disruption of homeostasis, we are currently applying high throughput functional metagenomic screens in order to identify signal molecules and mechanisms of bacteria-host cross-talk. together with the high resolution description of the human intestinal metagenome, as well as explorations of environmental proteins and metabolites, these observations will further our understanding of the functional roles bacteria play in the maintenance of health  and well-being in humans. it will open new perspectives for the monitoring and design of strategies for modulating the microbiota for health.

TI  == differential adaptation of human gut microbiota to bariatric surgery-induced weight loss: links with metabolic and low-grade inflammation markers.
AB  == objective: obesity alters gut microbiota ecology and associates with low-grade inflammation in humans. roux-en-y gastric bypass (rygb) surgery is one of the most efficient procedures for the treatment of morbid obesity resulting in drastic weight loss and improvement of metabolic and inflammatory status. we analyzed the impact of rygb on the modifications of gut microbiota and examined links with adaptations associated with this procedure. research design and methods: gut microbiota was profiled from fecal samples by real-time quantitative pcr in 13 lean control subjects and in 30 obese individuals (with seven type 2 diabetics) explored before (m0), 3 months (m3), and 6 months (m6) after rygb. results: four major findings are highlighted: 1) bacteroides/prevotella group was lower in obese subjects than in control subjects at m0 and increased at m3. it was negatively correlated with corpulence, but the correlation depended highly on caloric intake; 2) escherichia coli species increased at m3 and inversely correlated with fat mass and leptin levels independently of changes in food intake; 3) lactic acid bacteria including lactobacillus/leuconostoc/pediococcus group and bifidobacterium genus decreased at m3; and 4) faecalibacterium prausnitzii species was lower in subjects with diabetes and associated negatively with inflammatory markers at m0 and throughout the follow-up after surgery independently of changes in food intake. conclusions: these results suggest that  components of the dominant gut microbiota rapidly adapt in a starvation-like situation induced by rygb while the f. prausnitzii species is directly linked to  the reduction in low-grade inflammation state in obesity and diabetes independently of calorie intake.

AB  == purpose of review: dramatic advances in molecular characterization of the largely noncultivable enteric microbiota have facilitated better understanding of the composition of this complex ecosystem at broad phylogenetic levels. this review outlines current understanding of mechanisms by which commensal bacteria are controlled and shaped into functional communities by innate and adaptive immune responses, antimicrobial peptides produced by epithelial cells and host genetic factors. recent findings: secretory iga, which targets enteric bacteria, regulates the number, composition, and function of luminal bacteria. likewise, epithelial production of antimicrobial peptides helps control enteric microbiota  growth, translocation, and perhaps composition. the developing role of innate signaling pathways, such as toll-like receptors and nod2, is beginning to be studied, with dysbiosis following their genetic deletion. inflammation and effector immune responses lead to decreased diversity and selective alterations of functionally active bacterial species such as escherichia coli and faecalibacterium prausnitzii that have proinflammatory and protective activities, respectively. studies of humans, mice, and comparative species indicate that both genetic and early environmental factors influence the development of a stable intestinal microbiota. summary: genetic and mucosal immunity strongly influence the composition and function of enteric commensal bacteria. this understanding should help develop strategies to correct dysfunctional altered microbiota in genetically susceptible individuals, better diagnose and correct potential dysbiosis in high-risk individuals at a preclinical stage, and therapeutically target pathogenic bacterial species that help drive chronic inflammatory conditions.

TI  == rifaximin modulates the colonic microbiota of patients with crohn's disease: an in vitro approach using a continuous culture colonic model system.
AB  == objectives: rifaximin, a rifamycin derivative, has been reported to induce clinical remission of active crohn's disease (cd), a chronic inflammatory bowel disorder. in order to understand how rifaximin affects the colonic microbiota and its metabolism, an in vitro human colonic model system was used in this study. methods: we investigated the impact of the administration of 1800 mg/day of rifaximin on the faecal microbiota of four patients affected by colonic active cd [crohn's disease activity index (cdai > 200)] using a continuous culture colonic  model system. we studied the effect of rifaximin on the human gut microbiota using fluorescence in situ hybridization, quantitative pcr and pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. furthermore, we investigated the effect of the antibiotic on microbial metabolic profiles, using (1)h-nmr and solid phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and its potential genotoxicity and cytotoxicity, using comet and growth curve assays. results: rifaximin did not affect the overall composition of the gut microbiota,  whereas it caused an increase in concentration of bifidobacterium, atopobium and  faecalibacterium prausnitzii. a shift in microbial metabolism was observed, as shown by increases in short-chain fatty acids, propanol, decanol, nonanone and aromatic organic compounds, and decreases in ethanol, methanol and glutamate. no  genotoxicity or cytotoxicity was attributed to rifaximin, and conversely rifaximin was shown to have a chemopreventive role by protecting against hydrogen peroxide-induced dna damage. conclusions: we demonstrated that rifaximin, while not altering the overall structure of the human colonic microbiota, increased bifidobacteria and led to variation of metabolic profiles associated with potential beneficial effects on the host.

TI  == dysbiosis of fecal microbiota in crohn's disease patients as revealed by a custom phylogenetic microarray.
AB  == background: a custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  rna probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and crohn's disease (cd) patients. methods: oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "goarray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16s rrna sequences. fecal 16s rdna  from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six cd patients were used as  template to generate fluorescently labeled crna that was hybridized to the microarray. differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with species-specific primer sets. results: the microarray analyses showed that eubacterium rectale, bacteroides fragilis group, b. vulgatus, ruminococcus albus, r. callidus, r. bromii, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the cd patients, while enterococcus sp., clostridium difficile, escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, and listeria sp. were more abundant in the cd group. conclusions: the microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. in addition, the microarray showed that enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the cd patients. this microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == highlighting new phylogenetic specificities of crohn's disease microbiota.
AB  == background: recent studies suggest that gastrointestinal (gi) microbes play a part in the pathogenesis of crohn's disease (cd). methods: fecal samples were collected from 16 healthy individuals and 16 cd patients (age- and sex-matched).  the dna extracted from these samples were subjected to two different methods of microbiome analysis. specific bacterial groups were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods using primers designed using a high-throughput in-house bioinformatics pipeline. the same dna extracts were also used to produce fluorescently labeled crna amplicons to interrogate a custom-designed phylogenetic microarray for intestinal bacteria. results: even though the intersubject variability was high, differences in the fecal microbiomes of healthy and cd patients were detected. faecalibacterium prausnitzii and escherichia coli were more represented in healthy and ileal cd patients, respectively. additionally, probes specific for ruminococcus bromii, oscillibacter valericigenes, bifidobacterium bifidum, and eubacterium rectale produced stronger hybridization signals with the dna samples from healthy subjects. conversely, species overrepresented in cd patients were e. coli, enterococcus faecium, and species from the proteobacteria not normally found in the healthy human gi tract. furthermore, we detected "healthy specific" molecular species or operational taxonomic units (otus) that are not closely related to any known species (faecalibacterium, subdoligranulum, and oscillospora species), indicating that the phylogenetic dysbiosis is broader than at strain or species level. conclusions: these two techniques of microbiome analysis provided a statistically robust new picture of the dysbiosis in fecal microbiota from ileal  cd patients. specifically, we identified a set of six species discriminant for cd, which provides a preliminary diagnostic tool.

TI  == is the abundance of faecalibacterium prausnitzii relevant to crohn's disease?
AB  == reports that bacteria within the firmicutes phylum, especially the species faecalibacterium prausnitzii, are less abundant in crohn's disease (cd) patients  and supernatants from cultures of this bacterium are anti-inflammatory prompted the investigation of the possible correlations between the abundance of f. prausnitzii and the response to treatment in patients with gut diseases and healthy controls. in a randomized, double-blind trial, faeces were collected from healthy volunteers, and from patients with active cd, ulcerative colitis (uc) and irritable bowel syndrome before and after treatment. the levels of f. prausnitzii dna in faecal suspensions were determined by pcr. treatment by an elemental diet  was effective, resulting in decreases in both the harvey and bradshaw index (p<0.001) and the concentrations of serum c-reactive protein (p<0.05). the total  levels of f. prausnitzii in faecal samples from cd patients at presentation were  lower than those in the other groups both before and after the treatment. there was no correlation between f. prausnitzii abundance and the severity of cd before treatment. clinical improvement unexpectedly correlated with a significant decrease in the abundance of f. prausnitzii, especially the a2-165 subgroup (p<0.05). our data suggest that a paucity of f. prausnitzii in the gastrointestinal microbial communities is likely to be a minor aetiological factor in cd: recovery following elemental diet is attributed to lower levels of  gut flora.

TI  == the bacteriology of pouchitis: a molecular phylogenetic analysis using 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing.
AB  == objective: to identify, compare, and contrast the microbiota in patients with and without pouchitis after restorative proctocolectomy (rpc) for ulcerative colitis  (uc) and familial adenomatous polyposis (fap). summary background data: pouchitis is the most common complication following rpc. an abnormal host-microbial interaction has been implicated. we investigated the pouch microbiota in patients with and without pouchitis undergoing restorative proctocolectomy for uc and fap. methods: mucosal pouch biopsies, taken from 16 uc (pouchitis 8) and 8 fap (pouchitis 3) patients were analyzed to the species (or phylotype) level by cloning and sequencing of 3184 full-length bacterial 16s rrna genes. results: there was a significant increase in proteobacteria (p = 0.019) and a significant  decrease in bacteroidetes (p = 0.001) and faecalibacterium prausnitzii (p = 0.029) in the total uc compared with the total fap cohort, but only limited differences were found between the uc nonpouchitis and pouchitis groups and the fap pouchitis and nonpouchitis groups. bacterial diversity in the fap nonpouchitis group was significantly greater than in uc nonpouchitis (p = 0.019)  and significantly greater in uc nonpouchitis compared with uc pouchitis (p = 0.009). no individual species or phylotype specifically associated with either uc or fap pouchitis was found. conclusions: uc pouch patients have a different, less diverse, gut microbiota than fap patients. a further reduction in bacterial diversity but no significant dysbiosis occurs in those with pouchitis. the study  suggests that a dysbiosis occurs in the ileal pouch of uc rpc patients which predisposes to, but may not directly cause, pouchitis.

TI  == diets supplemented with chickpea or its main oligosaccharide component raffinose  modify faecal microbial composition in healthy adults.
AB  == the effects of diets supplemented with either chickpea or its main oligosaccharide raffinose on the composition of the faecal microbial community were examined in 12 healthy adults (18-65 years) in a randomised crossover intervention study. subjects consumed their usual diet supplemented with soups and desserts that were unfortified, or fortified with either 200 g/d of canned chickpeas or 5 g/d of raffinose for 3 week periods. changes in faecal bacterial populations of subjects were examined using 16s rrna-based terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (t-rflp) and clone libraries generated from the diet pools. classification of the clone libraries and t-rflp analysis revealed that faecalibacterium prausnitzii, reported to be an efficient butyrate producer  and a highly metabolically active bacterium in the human intestinal microbiota, was more abundant in the raffinose diet and the chickpea diet compared to the control diet. however, no significant difference was observed in the faecal total short chain fatty acid concentration or in the levels of the components (butyrate, acetate and propionate) with the chickpea diet or the raffinose diet compared to the control diet. bifidobacterium species were detected by t-rflp in  all three diet groups and quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) analysis showed a marginal increase in 16s rrna gene copies of bifidobacterium with the raffinose diet compared to control (p>0.05). the number of individuals showing trfs for the clostridium histolyticum - clostridum lituseburense groups, which include pathogenic bacteria species and putrefactive bacteria, were lower in the chickpea diet compared to the other two treatments. diet appeared to affect colonisation by a high ammonia-producing bacterial isolate which was detected in 83%, 92% and  42% of individuals in the control, raffinose and chickpea groups, respectively. our results indicate that chickpea and raffinose have the potential to modulate the intestinal microbial composition to promote intestinal health in humans.

TI  == quantification of faecalibacterium prausnitzii- and subdoligranulum variabile-like bacteria in the cecum of chickens by real-time pcr.
AB  == the intestinal microbial community is playing an important role in health and production performance of chickens. to understand the effect on the intestinal microflora induced by various feeding strategies, feed additives, infections, and intestinal disorders, it is important to have methods for quantifying potentially important bacteria in the intestine. we describe a real-time quantitative assay for detection and quantification of a whole group of faecalibacterium prausnitzii and subdoligranulum variabile-like bacteria, which has recently been found to dominate in the cecum of broiler chickens. the f. prausnitzii-s. variabile-like bacteria were quantified using a multiprobe assay in which one primer set was used to amplify dna from all bacteria, whereas 2 probes detected all bacteria and the group of f. prausnitzii-s. variabile-like bacteria, respectively. the multiprobe assay accurately quantified the percentage of this group in a sample if it constituted more than approximately 5% of the total bacterial community. if the fraction of f. prausnitzii-s. variabile-like bacteria was lower than 5%, a duplex assay was applied in which the total bacteria were amplified in one tube and the f. prausnitzii-s. variabile-like group of bacteria was amplified in another tube using a specific forward primer. the f. prausnitzii-s. variabile-like group of bacteria was quantified in the cecum and ileum of conventional and organic raised chickens, in chickens kept in an isolator from 1  d of age, and in hatcher material. quantification of this group of f. prausnitzii-s. variabile-like bacteria has not been performed before by real-time pcr, but results confirm previous results obtained by cloning and sequencing showing that the f. prausnitzii-s. variabile-like group of bacteria constitutes a major fraction of the cecal bacterial community in chickens. furthermore, results indicate that the poultry farm environment plays a role in recruitment and development of these bacteria in the intestinal microflora.

TI  == microbiota in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  == objective: to test the hypothesis that compared with controls, children with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) exhibit differences in the relationships between gut microbiota and disease activity. study design: children and adolescents (n =  69; median age, 14 years) with ibd and 25 healthy controls (median age, 14 years) were recruited for the study. the disease activity was determined according to the pediatric ulcerative colitis activity index or the pediatric crohn disease activity index. cell counts of 9 bacterial groups and species in the fecal microbiota were monitored by real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. results: although no major changes were observed in patients with ulcerative colitis, except for a decrease in bifidobacteria in the active state of ibd, children with active and inactive crohn's disease (cd) had lower numbers of faecalibacterium prausnitzii and bifidobacteria (p <.05), and patients with active cd had higher numbers of escherichia coli (p <.05). conclusions: the microbiota in children with cd is characterized by decreased numbers of f praunsitzii and increased numbers of e coli.

TI  == association between faecalibacterium prausnitzii and dietary fibre in colonic fermentation in healthy human subjects.
AB  == the intestinal microbiota are a complex ecosystem influencing the immunoregulation of the human host, providing protection from colonising pathogens and producing scfa as the main energy source of colonocytes. our objective was to investigate the effect of dietary fibre exclusion and supplementation on the intestinal microbiota and scfa concentrations. faecal samples were obtained from healthy volunteers before and after two 14 d periods of consuming formulated diets devoid or supplemented with fibre (14 g/l). the faecal microbiota were analysed using fluorescent in situ hybridisation and scfa  were measured using glc. there were large and statistically significant reductions in the numbers of the faecalibacterium prausnitzii (p < or = 0.01) and roseburia spp. (p < or = 0.01) groups during both the fibre-free and fibre-supplemented diets. significant and strong positive correlations between the proportion of f. prausnitzii and the proportion of butyrate during both baseline normal diets were found (pre-fibre free r 0.881, p = 0.001; pre-fibre supplemented r 0.844, p = 0.002). a significant correlation was also found between the proportional reduction in f. prausnitzii and the proportional reduction in faecal butyrate during both the fibre-free (r 0.806; p = 0.005) and  the fibre-supplemented diet (r 0.749; p = 0.013). these findings may contribute to the understanding of the association between fibre, microbiota and fermentation in health, during enteral nutrition and in disease states such as crohn's disease.

TI  == prebiotic effect of fruit and vegetable shots containing jerusalem artichoke inulin: a human intervention study.
AB  == the present study aimed to determine the prebiotic effect of fruit and vegetable  shots containing inulin derived from jerusalem artichoke (ja). a three-arm parallel, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was carried out with sixty-six healthy human volunteers (thirty-three men and thirty-three women, age range: 18-50 years). subjects were randomised into three groups (n 22) assigned to consume either the test shots, pear-carrot-sea buckthorn (pcs) or plum-pear-beetroot (ppb), containing ja inulin (5 g/d) or the placebo. fluorescent in situ hybridisation was used to monitor populations of total bacteria, bacteroides, bifidobacteria, clostridium perfringens/histolyticum subgroup, eubacterium rectale/clostridium coccoides group, lactobacillus/enterococcus spp., atopobium spp., faecalibacterium prausnitzii and propionibacteria. bifidobacteria levels were significantly higher on consumption  of both the pcs and ppb shots (10.0 (sd 0.24) and 9.8 (sd 0.22) log10 cells/g faeces, respectively) compared with placebo (9.3 (sd 0.42) log10 cells/g faeces)  (p < 0.0001). a small though significant increase in lactobacillus/enterococcus group was also observed for both the pcs and ppb shots (8.3 (sd 0.49) and 8.3 (sd 0.36) log10 cells/g faeces, respectively) compared with placebo (8.1 (sd 0.37) log10 cells/g faeces) (p = 0.042). other bacterial groups and faecal scfa concentrations remained unaffected. no extremities were seen in the adverse events, medication or bowel habits. a slight significant increase in flatulence was reported in the subjects consuming the pcs and ppb shots compared with placebo, but overall flatulence levels remained mild. a very high level of compliance (>90 %) to the product was observed. the present study confirms the prebiotic efficacy of fruit and vegetable shots containing ja inulin.

TI  == selected microbial groups and short-chain fatty acids profile in a simulated chicken cecum supplemented with two strains of lactobacillus.
AB  == among the bacterial fermentation end products in the chicken cecum, butyrate is of particular importance because of its nutritional properties for the epithelial cell and pathogen inhibitory effects in the gut. an in vitro experiment, operated with batch bioreactor, was conducted to quantify butyric-producing bacteria in a  simulated broiler cecum supplemented with lactobacillus salivarius ssp. salicinius jcm 1230 and lactobacillus agilis jcm 1048 during 24 h of incubation.  selected bacterial species were determined by real-time pcr and short-chain fatty acids and lactate concentrations were monitored. the results showed that after 24 h of incubation, lactobacillus supplementation significantly increased the number of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and faecalibacterium prausnitzii in medium containing cecal content and lactobacilli supplementation (cc + l) compared with  the control (cc). addition of lactobacilli did not alter escherichia coli and clostridium butyricum, whereas it significantly (p < 0.05) reduced salmonella in  treatment cc + l compared with the cc treatment. propionate and butyrate formation were significantly (p < 0.05) increased in treatment cc + l as compared with the cc treatment. lactate was only detected in treatment containing 2 lactobacillus strains. after 24 h of incubation, acetate concentration significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in all treatments. it was suggested that lactate produced by lactobacillus in the cecal content improved the growth of butyric producers such as f. prausnitzii, which significantly increased butyrate  accumulation. additionally, the results showed that butyrate and propionate inhibited salmonella without influencing the e. coli profile.

TI  == intestinal dysbiosis and reduced immunoglobulin-coated bacteria associated with coeliac disease in children.
AB  == background: coeliac disease is a chronic intestinal inflammatory disorder due to  an aberrant immune response to dietary gluten proteins in genetically predisposed individuals. mucosal immune response through iga secretion constitutes a first line of defence responsible for neutralizing noxious antigens and pathogens. the  aim of this study was the characterization of the relationships between immunoglobulin-coated bacteria and bacterial composition of faeces of coeliac disease (cd) patients, untreated and treated with a gluten-free diet (gfd) and healthy controls. results: iga-coated faecal bacterial levels were significantly  lower in both untreated and treated cd patients than in healthy controls. igg and igm-coated bacterial levels were also significantly lower in treated cd patients  than in untreated cd patients and controls. gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria ratio was significantly reduced in both cd patients compared to controls. bifidobacterium, clostridium histolyticum, c. lituseburense and faecalibacterium prausnitzii group proportions were less abundant (p < 0.050) in  untreated cd patients than in healthy controls. bacteroides-prevotella group proportions were more abundant (p < 0.050) in untreated cd patients than in controls. levels of iga coating the bacteroides-prevotella group were significantly reduced (p < 0.050) in both cd patients in comparison with healthy  controls. conclusions: in cd patients, reduced iga-coated bacteria is associated  with intestinal dysbiosis, which altogether provide new insights into the possible relationships between the gut microbiota and the host defences in this disorder.

AB  == background: acute appendicitis is a local intestinal inflammation with unclear origin. the aim was to test whether bacteria in appendicitis differ in composition to bacteria found in caecal biopsies from healthy and disease controls. methods and patients: we investigated sections of 70 appendices using rrna-based fluorescence in situ hybridisation. four hundred caecal biopsies and 400 faecal samples from patients with inflammatory bowel disease and other conditions were used as controls. a set of 73 group-specific bacterial probes was applied for the study. results: the mucosal surface in catarrhal appendicitis showed characteristic lesions of single epithelial cells filled with a mixed bacterial population ('pinned cells') without ulceration of the surroundings. bacteria deeply infiltrated the tissue in suppurative appendicitis. fusobacteria  (mainly fusobacterium nucleatum and necrophorum) were a specific component of these epithelial and submucosal infiltrates in 62% of patients with proven appendicitis. the presence of fusobacteria in mucosal lesions correlated positively with the severity of the appendicitis and was completely absent in caecal biopsies from healthy and disease controls. main faecal microbiota represented by bacteroides, eubacterium rectale (clostridium group xiva), faecalibacterium prausnitzii groups and akkermansia muciniphila were inversely related to the severity of the disease. the occurrence of other bacterial groups  within mucosal lesions of acute appendicitis was not related to the severity of the appendicitis. no fusobacteria were found in rectal swabs of patients with acute appendicitis. conclusions: local infection with fusobacterium nucleatum/necrophorum is responsible for the majority of cases of acute appendicitis.

TI  == diversity of human colonic butyrate-producing bacteria revealed by analysis of the butyryl-coa:acetate coa-transferase gene.
AB  == butyrate-producing bacteria play an important role in the human colon, supplying  energy to the gut epithelium and regulating host cell responses. in order to explore the diversity and culturability of this functional group, we designed degenerate primers to amplify butyryl-coa:acetate coa-transferase sequences from  faecal samples provided by 10 healthy volunteers. eighty-eight per cent of amplified sequences showed >98% dna sequence identity to coa-transferases from cultured butyrate-producing bacteria, and these fell into 12 operational taxonomic units (otus). the four most prevalent otus corresponded to eubacterium  rectale, roseburia faecis, eubacterium hallii and an unnamed cultured species ss2/1. the remaining 12% of sequences, however, belonged to 20 otus that are assumed to come from uncultured butyrate-producing strains. samples taken after ingestion of inulin showed significant (p=0.019) increases in faecalibacterium prausnitzii. because several of the dominant butyrate producers differ in their dna % g+c content, analysis of thermal melt curves obtained for pcr amplicons of  the butyryl-coa:acetate coa-transferase gene provides a convenient and rapid qualitative assessment of the major butyrate producing groups present in a given  sample. this type of analysis therefore provides an excellent source of information on functionally important groups within the colonic microbial community.

TI  == the microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease in different age groups.
AB  == background: many efforts were made in the past decades to assess the role of gut  microbiota in inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd), leading to the hypothesis that an altered microbial composition, other than the presence of a specific pathogen, could be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. on the other hand, existing differences in gut microbial community between distinct classes of age make sense of an increasing research in microbial shifts in ibd. methods: cultural, molecular, metabolomic and metagenomic approaches are trying to define the human  gut microbiota in different age groups. results and conclusion: an increase in anaerobic bacteria (bacteroidesvulgatus, streptococcus faecalis) was observed in  adult ibd, whereas an increase in aerobic and facultative-anaerobic (escherichia  coli) was found in pediatric ibd. overall higher bacterial cell counts were observed in ibd, jointly with a general loss of biodiversity and a preponderance  of bacteroidetes and a parallel decrease of firmicutes phylum: a predominance of  potential harmful members of proteobacteria (e. coli) and low abundance of beneficial species (faecalibacterium prausnitzii) was also reported in pediatric  and adult age groups, respectively. microbial community of elderly subjects contains a wider range of different species than those of children and adults, both in healthy and ibd status.

TI  == effects of a gluten-free diet on gut microbiota and immune function in healthy adult human subjects.
AB  == diet influences the composition of the gut microbiota and host's health, particularly in patients suffering from food-related diseases. coeliac disease (cd) is a permanent intolerance to cereal gluten proteins and the only therapy for the patients is to adhere to a life-long gluten-free diet (gfd). in the present preliminary study, the effects of a gfd on the composition and immune function of the gut microbiota were analysed in ten healthy subjects (mean age 30.3 years) over 1 month. faecal microbiota was analysed by fluorescence in situ  hybridisation (fish) and quantitative pcr (qpcr). the ability of faecal bacteria  to stimulate cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) was determined by elisa. no significant differences in dietary intake were found before and after the gfd except for reductions (p = 0.001) in polysaccharides. bifidobacterium, clostridium lituseburense and faecalibacterium prausnitzii proportions decreased (p = 0.007, p = 0.031 and p = 0.009, respectively) as a result of the gfd analysed by fish. bifidobacterium, lactobacillus and bifidobacterium longum counts decreased (p = 0.020, p = 0.001 and p = 0.017, respectively), while enterobacteriaceae and escherichia coli counts increased (p  = 0.005 and p = 0.003) after the gfd assessed by qpcr. tnf-alpha, interferon-gamma, il-10 and il-8 production by pbmc stimulated with faecal samples was also reduced (p = 0.021, p = 0.037, p = 0.002 and p = 0.007, respectively) after the diet. therefore, the gfd led to reductions in beneficial  gut bacteria populations and the ability of faecal samples to stimulate the host's immunity. thus, the gfd may constitute an environmental variable to be considered in treated cd patients for its possible effects on gut health.

TI  == commensal bacteria, traditional and opportunistic pathogens, dysbiosis and bacterial killing in inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  == purpose of review: the authors present evidence published during the past 2 years of the roles of commensal and pathogenic bacteria in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory bowel diseases. recent findings: rodent models conclusively implicate commensal enteric bacteria in chronic, immune-mediated, experimental colitis, and genetically determined defects in bacterial killing by innate immune cells are found in a subset of patients with crohn's disease. there is no evidence that a single pathogen, including mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis, causes crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. however, adherent/invasive escherichia coli are associated with ileal crohn's disease, with the mechanisms and genetics of adherent/invasive e. coli virulence being elucidated. molecular characterization of the microbiota in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases reveals decreased biodiversity of commensal bacteria, most notably the phyla bacteroidetes and firmicutes, including the clinically relevant faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and increased e. coli concentrations. vsl#3 is one probiotic preparation shown to be efficacious in certain clinical situations in small clinical trials. summary: further characterization of altered microbiota in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases and linking dysbiosis with host genetic alterations in immunoregulation, innate microbial killing and barrier function are critical, so that individualized treatments to increase beneficial commensals and their metabolic products (probiotic and prebiotic administration) and diminish deleterious species such as adherent/invasive e. coli can be tailored for defined patient subsets.

AB  == background: the intestinal microbiota is suspected to play a role in colitis and  particularly in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) pathogenesis. the aim was to compare the fecal microbiota composition of patients with colitis to that of healthy subjects (hs). methods: fecal samples from 22 active crohn's disease (a-cd) patients, 10 cd patients in remission (r-cd), 13 active ulcerative colitis (a-uc) patients, 4 uc patients in remission (r-uc), 8 infectious colitis (ic) patients, and 27 hs were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) targeting the 16s rrna gene. bacterial counts were transformed to  logarithms (log(10) cfu) for statistical analysis. results: bacteria of the phylum firmicutes (clostridium leptum and clostridium coccoides groups) were less represented in a-ibd patients (9.7; p = 0.004) and ic (9.4; p = 0.02), compared to hs (10.8). faecalibacterium prausnitzii species (a major representative of the c. leptum group) had lower counts in a-ibd and ic patients compared to hs (8.8 and 8.3 versus 10.4; p = 0.0004 and p = 0.003). the firmicutes/bacteroidetes ratio was lower in a-ibd (1.3; p = 0.0001) and ic patients (0.4; p = 0.002). compared to hs, bifidobacteria were less represented in a-ibd and ic (7.9 and 7.7 versus 9.2; p = 0.001 and p = 0.01). conclusions: the fecal microbiota of patients with ibd differs from that of hs. the phylum firmicutes and particularly the species f. prausnitzii, are underrepresented in a-ibd patients as well as in  ic patients. these bacteria could be crucial to gut homeostasis since lower counts of f. prausnitzii are consistently associated with a reduced protection of the gut mucosa.

TI  == diversity, metabolism and microbial ecology of butyrate-producing bacteria from the human large intestine.
AB  == butyrate-producing bacteria play a key role in colonic health in humans. this review provides an overview of the current knowledge of the diversity, metabolism and microbial ecology of this functionally important group of bacteria. human colonic butyrate producers are gram-positive firmicutes, but are phylogenetically diverse, with the two most abundant groups related to eubacterium rectale/roseburia spp. and to faecalibacterium prausnitzii. five different arrangements have been identified for the genes of the central pathway involved in butyrate synthesis, while in most cases butyryl-coa : acetate coa-transferase, rather than butyrate kinase, appears to perform the final step in butyrate synthesis. mechanisms have been proposed recently in non-gut clostridium spp. whereby butyrate synthesis can result in energy generation via both substrate-level phosphorylation and proton gradients. here we suggest that these  mechanisms also apply to the majority of butyrate producers from the human colon. the roles of these bacteria in the gut community and their influence on health are now being uncovered, taking advantage of the availability of cultured isolates and molecular methodologies. populations of f. prausnitzii are reported  to be decreased in crohn's disease, for example, while populations of roseburia relatives appear to be particularly sensitive to the diet composition in human volunteer studies.

TI  == bacterial flora in inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  == the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) involves an interaction between host susceptibility (which is partly genetically determined), mucosal immunity and the intestinal milieu. micro-organisms have physiological effects on mucosal structure, epithelial turnover, the intestinal immune cells and, thus, on many intestinal functions. toll-like receptors and nucleotide oligomerisation-binding domain proteins in host cells recognise specific bacterial molecules and modify the immune response. human studies have repeatedly shown that the microbiota of patients with ibd differs from that of controls and  is unstable, both in the intestinal lumen and at the surface of the mucosa. a single pathogen has not been identified, but potentially pro-inflammatory micro-organisms have been found in samples from ibd patients more often than from healthy controls. these include mycobacterium paratuberculosis, and enteroadherent and invasive escherichia coli in crohn's disease (cd). ecological  descriptions of the microbiota present in patients with ibd (either in the faeces or adherent to the mucosa) have repeatedly reported a decrease in usually dominant bacteria, especially those from the dominant phylum firmicutes. a decrease in the biodiversity of firmicutes has been observed in cd, while a recent study has shown that a decrease in firmicutes, especially faecalibacterium prausnitzii, was associated with cd and the post-operative recurrence of cd lesions in the ileum. taken together, these results suggest that dysbiosis, or an imbalance within the (dominant) intestinal microbiota, may favour ibd.

TI  == bacterial succession in the colon during childhood and adolescence: molecular studies in a southern indian village.
AB  == background: the colonic bacterial flora, largely anaerobic, is believed to establish and stabilize in the first 2 y of life. objective: this study was undertaken to determine whether the bacterial flora of the colon undergoes further changes (succession) during childhood and adolescence. design: this cross-sectional study examined fecal samples from 130 healthy children and adolescents in the age group 2-17 y and from 30 healthy adults (median age: 42 y) residing in a single village in southern india. dna was extracted and subjected to 16s rdna-targeted real-time polymerase chain reaction to determine the relative predominance of bifidobacterium genus, bacteroides-prevotella-porphyromonas group, lactobacillus acidophilus group, eubacterium rectale, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii. results: bifidobacterium species and bacteroides-prevotella group were dominant fecal bacteria overall. e. rectale and lactobacillus species were considerably less abundant. clear age-related differences emerged, with a steep decline in bifidobacterium species  in adults (p < 0.0001), a steep decline of lactobacillus species >5 y of age (p < 0.0001), an increase in bacteroides during late adolescence and in adults (p = 0.0040), an increase in e. rectale during childhood and adolescence followed by a steep decline in adults (p < 0.0001), and a late childhood peak of f. prausnitzii with decline in adolescents and adults (p < 0.0001). conclusions: changes in the  bacterial flora occur during childhood and adolescence characterized by reduction in lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species and an increase in bacteroides, e rectale, and f. prausnitzii peaked during late childhood in this population.

TI  == twin studies reveal specific imbalances in the mucosa-associated microbiota of patients with ileal crohn's disease.
AB  == background: large interindividual variation in the composition of the intestinal  microbiota between unrelated individuals has made it challenging to identify specific aspects of dysbiosis that lead to crohn's disease (cd). methods: to reduce variations in exposure during establishment of the gut flora and the influence of genotype, we studied the mucosa-associated microbiota of monozygotic twin pairs that were discordant (n = 6) or concordant (n = 4) for cd. dna was extracted from biopsies collected from 5 locations between the ileum and rectum.  bacterial 16s ribosomal rna genes were amplified and community composition assessed by terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism, cloning and sequencing, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results:  the microbial compositions at all biopsy locations for each individual were similar, regardless of disease state, but there were differences between individuals. in particular, individuals with predominantly ileal cd had a dramatically lower abundance (p < 0.001) of faecalibacterium prausnitzii and increased abundance (p < 0.03) of escherichia coli compared to healthy co-twins and those with cd localized in the colon. this dysbiosis was significantly correlated to the disease phenotype rather than genotype. conclusions: the reduced abundance of f. prausnitzii and increased abundance of e. coli are indicative of an ileal cd phenotype, distinct from colonic cd, and the relative abundances of these specific bacterial populations are promising biomarker candidates for differential diagnosis of cd and eventually customized treatment.

TI  == faecalibacterium prausnitzii is an anti-inflammatory commensal bacterium identified by gut microbiota analysis of crohn disease patients.
AB  == a decrease in the abundance and biodiversity of intestinal bacteria within the dominant phylum firmicutes has been observed repeatedly in crohn disease (cd) patients. in this study, we determined the composition of the mucosa-associated microbiota of cd patients at the time of surgical resection and 6 months later using fish analysis. we found that a reduction of a major member of firmicutes, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, is associated with a higher risk of postoperative recurrence of ileal cd. a lower proportion of f. prausnitzii on resected ileal crohn mucosa also was associated with endoscopic recurrence at 6 months. to evaluate the immunomodulatory properties of f. prausnitzii we analyzed the anti-inflammatory effects of f. prausnitzii in both in vitro (cellular models) and in vivo [2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (tnbs)-induced] colitis in mice. in caco-2 cells transfected with a reporter gene for nf-kappab activity, f. prausnitzii had no effect on il-1beta-induced nf-kappab activity, whereas the supernatant abolished it. in vitro peripheral blood mononuclear cell stimulation  by f. prausnitzii led to significantly lower il-12 and ifn-gamma production levels and higher secretion of il-10. oral administration of either live f. prausnitzii or its supernatant markedly reduced the severity of tnbs colitis and  tended to correct the dysbiosis associated with tnbs colitis, as demonstrated by  real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr) analysis. f. prausnitzii exhibits anti-inflammatory effects on cellular and tnbs colitis models, partly due to secreted metabolites able to block nf-kappab activation and il-8 production. these results suggest that counterbalancing dysbiosis using f. prausnitzii as a probiotic is a promising strategy in cd treatment.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of the gene for cellobiose 2-epimerase from a ruminal strain of eubacterium cellulosolvens.
AB  == cellobiose 2-epimerase (ce; ec 5.1.3.11) is known to catalyze the reversible epimerization of cellobiose to 4-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl-d-mannose in ruminococcus albus cells. here, we report a ce in a ruminal strain of eubacterium cellulosolvens for the first time. the nucleotide sequence of the ce had an orf of 1218 bp (405 amino acids; 46 963.3 da). the ce from e. cellulosolvens showed 44-54% identity to n-acyl-d-glucosamine 2-epimerase-like hypothetical proteins in the genomes of coprococcus eutactus, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, clostridium phytofermentans, caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus, and eubacterium siraeum. surprisingly, it exhibited only 46% identity to a ce from r. albus. the recombinant enzyme expressed in escherichia coli was purified by two-step chromatography. the purified enzyme had a molecular mass of 46.7 kda and exhibited optimal activity at around 35 degrees c and ph 7.0-8.5. in addition to  cello-oligosaccharides, it converted lactose to epilactose (4-o-beta-d-galactopyranosyl-d-mannose).

TI  == real-time polymerase chain reaction quantification of specific butyrate-producing bacteria, desulfovibrio and enterococcus faecalis in the feces of patients with colorectal cancer.
AB  == background and aim: bacterial metabolites produced in the bowel are potentially related to the genesis of colorectal cancer. butyrate is protective against cancer, whereas hydrogen sulfide and oxygen free radicals can be toxic to the epithelium. the present study was designed to quantitate eubacterium rectale, faecalibacterium prausnitzii (both butyrate-producing bacteria), desulfovibrio (sulfate-reducing bacteria), and enterococcus faecalis (that produces extracellular superoxide) in the feces of patients with colorectal cancer. methods: dna was extracted from feces of 20 patients with colorectal cancer, nine patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer and 17 healthy volunteers. real-time  polymerase chain reaction using primers aimed at 16s rdna was used to quantitate  the above bacterial species or genus, and this was expressed relative to amplification of universal sequences conserved among all bacteria. results: levels of e. rectale and f. prausnitzii were decreased approximately fourfold (p  = 0.0088 and 0.0028, respectively) in colorectal cancer patients compared to healthy control volunteers. levels of desulfovibrio were not significantly different between the three groups. e. faecalis populations were significantly higher in colorectal cancer patients compared to healthy volunteers (p = 0.0294). conclusions: butyrate producers were decreased and e. faecalis increased in the feces of colon cancer patients. these shifts in the colonic bacterial population  could potentially lead to epithelial cell damage and increased turnover and may be a factor leading to colon cancer.

TI  == effect of inulin on the human gut microbiota: stimulation of bifidobacterium adolescentis and faecalibacterium prausnitzii.
AB  == prebiotics are food ingredients that improve health by modulating the colonic microbiota. the bifidogenic effect of the prebiotic inulin is well established; however, it remains unclear which species of bifidobacterium are stimulated in vivo and whether bacterial groups other than lactic acid bacteria are affected by inulin consumption. changes in the faecal microbiota composition were examined by real-time pcr in twelve human volunteers after ingestion of inulin (10 g/d) for a 16-d period in comparison with a control period without any supplement intake. the prevalence of most bacterial groups examined did not change after inulin intake, although the low g+c % gram-positive species faecalibacterium prausnitzii exhibited a significant increase (10.3% for control period v. 14.5% during inulin intake, p=0.019). the composition of the genus bifidobacterium was studied in four of the volunteers by clone library analysis. between three and five bifidobacterium spp. were found in each volunteer. bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium longum were present in all volunteers, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium dentium were also detected. real-time pcr was employed to quantify the four most prevalent bifidobacterium spp., b. adolescentis, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum and b. bifidum, in ten volunteers carrying detectable levels of bifidobacteria. b. adolescentis showed the strongest response to inulin consumption, increasing from 0.89 to 3.9% of the total microbiota (p=0.001). b. bifidum was increased from 0.22 to 0.63% (p<0.001) for the five volunteers for whom this species was present.

TI  == biostructure of fecal microbiota in healthy subjects and patients with chronic idiopathic diarrhea.
AB  == background & aims: dysbiosis is a key component of intestinal disorders. our aim  was to quantitatively access the biostructure of fecal microbiota in healthy subjects and patients with chronic idiopathic diarrhea and evaluate the responses to saccharomyces boulardii treatment. methods: we investigated punched fecal cylinders from 20 patients with chronic idiopathic diarrhea and 20 healthy controls using fluorescence in situ hybridization. fluctuations in assembly of 11 bacterial groups were monitored weekly for 3 weeks before, during, and after oral s boulardii supplementation. results: the structural organization of fecal microbiota in healthy subjects was stable and unaffected by s boulardii. the assembly of fecal microbiota in idiopathic diarrhea was markedly different, characterized by mucus depositions within feces; mucus septa and striae; marked reduction in concentrations of habitual eubacterium rectale, bacteroides, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii groups; suppression of bacterial fluorescence in the center of the feces; increased concentrations and spatial shift of mucotrop bacteria to the fecal core; and increased concentrations of occasional bacteria.  except for elevated concentrations of some occasional bacterial groups, all parameters typical for diarrhea improved significantly with s boulardii treatment and most changes persisted after cessation of therapy. the improvement of the fecal microbiota was accompanied by partial (40%) and complete normalization (30%) of the diarrheal symptoms. conclusions: the fecal microbiota is highly structured. fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis allowed us to quantitatively study the dysbiotic changes. s boulardii significantly improved the fecal biostructure in patients with diarrhea but had no influence on the feces in healthy subjects.

TI  == exopolysaccharides produced by intestinal bifidobacterium strains act as fermentable substrates for human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == eleven exopolysaccharides (eps) isolated from different human intestinal bifidobacterium strains were tested in fecal slurry batch cultures and compared with glucose and the prebiotic inulin for their abilities to act as fermentable substrates for intestinal bacteria. during incubation, the increases in levels of short-chain fatty acids (scfa) were considerably more pronounced in cultures with eps, glucose, and inulin than in controls without carbohydrates added, indicating that the substrates assayed were fermented by intestinal bacteria. shifts in molar proportions of scfa during incubation with eps and inulin caused a decrease in the acetic acid-to-propionic acid ratio, a possible indicator of the hypolipidemic effect of prebiotics, with the lowest values for this parameter being obtained for eps from the species bifidobacterium longum and from bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum strain c52. this behavior was contrary to that  found with glucose, a carbohydrate not considered to be a prebiotic and for which a clear increase of this ratio was obtained during incubation. quantitative real-time pcr showed that eps exerted a moderate bifidogenic effect, which was comparable to that of inulin for some polymers but which was lower than that found for glucose. pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 16s rrna gene fragments using universal primers was employed to analyze microbial groups other  than bifidobacteria. changes in banding patterns during incubation with eps indicated microbial rearrangements of bacteroides and escherichia coli relatives. moreover, the use of eps from b. pseudocatenulatum in fecal cultures from some individuals accounted for the prevalence of desulfovibrio and faecalibacterium prausnitzii, whereas incubation with eps from b. longum supported populations close to anaerostipes, prevotella, and/or oscillospira. thus, eps synthesized by  intestinal bifidobacteria could act as fermentable substrates for microorganisms  in the human gut environment, modifying interactions among intestinal populations.

TI  == molecular analysis of the digestive microbiota in a gnotobiotic mouse model during antibiotic treatment: influence of saccharomyces boulardii.
AB  == the probiotic saccharomyces boulardii is a non-pathogenic yeast that has been proven efficient in the prevention of antimicrobial-associated diarrhea and of clostridium difficile associated colitis. we evaluated the influence of the administration of s. boulardii on the composition of the fecal microbiota in a human microbiota-associated mouse model. this evaluation was run before, during and after a 7-day oral treatment with amoxicillin clavulanic acid. predominant groups of bacteria were quantified with fluorescence in situ hybridization combined with flow cytometry using group-specific 16s rrna targeted oligonucleotide probes designed for the eubacteria, bacteroides-porphyromonas-prevotella, clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale,  faecalibacterium prausnitzii, clostridium histolyticum, lactobacillus-enterococcus and enterobacteriaceae groups and bifidobacterium species. s. boulardii did not quantitatively alter the total anaerobic microbiota nor the dominant bacterial groups. during the antibiotic treatment in the two groups of mice receiving the yeast or not, the level of enterobacteriaceae and bacteroides groups increased when the c. coccoides-e. rectale group decreased dramatically. after the antibiotic treatment was discontinued, the return to the  initial level was reached more rapidly in the s. boulardii-treated mice than in the control mice (p<0.05) for the c. coccoides-e. rectale and bacteroides-porphyromonas-prevotella groups. this quicker recovery of normal intestinal microbiota equilibrium after antibiotic therapy could be a mechanism for s. boulardii preventive effect on antibiotic-associated diarrhea in humans.

TI  == symbiotic gut microbes modulate human metabolic phenotypes.
AB  == humans have evolved intimate symbiotic relationships with a consortium of gut microbes (microbiome) and individual variations in the microbiome influence host  health, may be implicated in disease etiology, and affect drug metabolism, toxicity, and efficacy. however, the molecular basis of these microbe-host interactions and the roles of individual bacterial species are obscure. we now demonstrate a"transgenomic" approach to link gut microbiome and metabolic phenotype (metabotype) variation. we have used a combination of spectroscopic, microbiomic, and multivariate statistical tools to analyze fecal and urinary samples from seven chinese individuals (sampled twice) and to model the microbial-host metabolic connectivities. at the species level, we found structural differences in the chinese family gut microbiomes and those reported for american volunteers, which is consistent with population microbial cometabolic differences reported in epidemiological studies. we also introduce the concept of functional metagenomics, defined as "the characterization of key functional members of the microbiome that most influence host metabolism and hence health." for example, faecalibacterium prausnitzii population variation is  associated with modulation of eight urinary metabolites of diverse structure, indicating that this species is a highly functionally active member of the microbiome, influencing numerous host pathways. other species were identified showing different and varied metabolic interactions. our approach for understanding the dynamic basis of host-microbiome symbiosis provides a foundation for the development of functional metagenomics as a probe of systemic  effects of drugs and diet that are of relevance to personal and public health care solutions.

TI  == active crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis can be specifically diagnosed and monitored based on the biostructure of the fecal flora.
AB  == background: the intestinal microflora is important in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). the impact of its spatial organization on health and disease is unknown. methods: we investigated sections of paraffin-embedded punched fecal cylinders. fluctuations in spatial distribution of 11 bacterial groups were monitored in healthy subjects (n = 32), patients with ibd (n = 204), and other gastrointestinal diseases (n = 186) using fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish). results: the microbial structure differed in patients with crohn's disease (cd), ulcerative colitis (uc), and healthy and disease controls. the profiles of cd and uc were distinctly opposite in 6 of 11 fish probes used. most prominent were a depletion of faecalibacterium prausnitzii (fprau<1 x 10(9)/ml) with a normal leukocyte count in cd and a massive increase of leukocytes in the fecal-mucus transition zone (>30 leukocytes/10(4) microm(2)) with high fprau in patients with uc. these 2 features alone enabled the recognition of active cd (crohn's disease activity index [cdai] >150) or uc (clinical activity index [cai] >3) with 79%/80% sensitivity and 98%/100% specificity. the mismatch in the sensitivity was mainly due to overlap between single ibd entities, and the specificity was exclusively due to the similarity of crohn's and celiac disease. when inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) patients were pooled the sensitivity was 100% for severe disease, 84% for moderate activity, 72% for ibd with < or =12 months remission, and 24% for ibd with >12 months remission. conclusions: the fecal flora is highly structured and spatially organized. diagnosing ibd and monitoring disease activity can be performed based  on analysis of punched fecal cylinders independent from the patient's complaints.

TI  == imbalance in the composition of the duodenal microbiota of children with coeliac  disease.
AB  == coeliac disease (cd) is the most common immune-mediated enteropathy characterized by chronic inflammation of the small intestinal mucosa. the ingestion of gluten is responsible for the symptoms of cd, but other environmental factors are also thought to play a role in this disorder. in this study, the composition of the duodenal microbiota of coeliac children with active disease, symptom-free cd patients on a gluten-free diet and control children was determined. bacteriological analyses of duodenal biopsy specimens were carried out by fluorescent in situ hybridization coupled with flow cytometry. the proportions of total bacteria and gram-negative bacteria were significantly higher in cd patients with active disease than in symptom-free cd patients and controls. bacteroides and escherichia coli groups were significantly more abundant in cd patients with active disease than in controls, whilst these bacterial deviations  were normalized in symptom-free cd patients. the ratio of lactobacillus--bifidobacterium to bacteroides--e. coli was significantly reduced  in coeliac patients with either active or inactive disease compared with controls. the differences in atopobium, eubacterium rectale--clostridium coccoides, clostridium histolyticum, clostridium lituseburense, sulphate-reducing bacteria and faecalibacterium prausnitzii populations among the three groups of children were less relevant. overall, the higher incidence of gram-negative and potentially pro-inflammatory bacteria in the duodenal microbiota of coeliac children was linked to the symptomatic presentation of the disease and could favour the pathological process of the disorder.

TI  == influence of bifidobacterium longum bb536 intake on faecal microbiota in individuals with japanese cedar pollinosis during the pollen season.
AB  == it has been reported that intake of yogurt or powder supplemented with the bifidobacterium longum bb536 probiotic strain alleviated subjective symptoms and  affected blood markers of allergy in individuals with japanese cedar pollinosis (jcpsis) during the pollen seasons of 2004 and 2005, based on randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. furthermore, the 2004 study found that intestinal bacteria such as the bacteroides fragilis group significantly fluctuated during the pollen season in jcpsis individuals and intake of bb536 yogurt tended to suppress these fluctuations. the present study investigated faecal microbiota to examine whether any changes occurred during the pollen season and whether any influence was exerted by intake of bb536 powder in the 2005 pollen season, which happened to be a heavy season, to confirm the 2004 findings and to evaluate the relationship of microbiota with symptom development. in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 44 jcpsis subjects received bb536 or a placebo for 13 weeks during the pollen season. another 14 japanese cedar pollen (jcp)-specific ige negative healthy subjects received placebo for the same period. faecal samples were collected before (week 0), during (weeks 4, 8 and 13) and after (week 17) intervention, and out of jcp season (week 28). faecal microbiota were analysed using terminal-rflp (t-rflp) and real-time pcr methods. principal component analysis based on t-rflp indicated distinct patterns of microbiota between healthy subjects and jcpsis subjects in the placebo group, but an intermediate pattern in the bb536 group at week 13, the last stage of the pollen season. the coordinate of principal component 1 at week  13 correlated with composite scores of jcpsis symptoms recorded during the pollen season. faecalibacterium prausnitzii and the bacteroides fragilis group were identified as the main contributors to microbiotal fluctuations. real-time pcr indicated that bb536 intake suppressed increases in the bacteroides fragilis group compared with the placebo group (p <0.05). these results suggest that faecal microbiota in jcpsis subjects, but not healthy subjects, fluctuate at the  end of the pollen season and that bb536 intake plays a role in maintaining normal microbiota.

TI  == mucosa-associated bacterial diversity in relation to human terminal ileum and colonic biopsy samples.
AB  == little is known about bacterial communities that colonize mucosal surfaces in the human gastrointestinal tract, but they are believed to play an important role in  host physiology. the objectives of this study were to investigate the compositions of these populations in the distal small bowel and colon. healthy mucosal tissue from either the terminal ileum (n = 6) or ascending (n = 8), transverse (n = 8), or descending colon (n = 4) of 26 patients (age, 68.5 +/- 1.2 years [mean +/- standard deviation]) undergoing emergency resection of the large  bowel was used to study these communities. mucosa-associated eubacteria were characterized by using pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), while  real-time pcr was employed for quantitative analysis. mucosal communities were also visualized in situ using confocal laser scanning microscopy. dgge banding profiles from all the gut regions exhibited at least 45% homology, with five descending colon profiles clustering at ca. 75% concordance. real-time pcr showed that mucosal bacterial population densities were highest in the terminal ileum and that there were no significant differences in overall bacterial numbers in different parts of the colon. bifidobacterial numbers were significantly higher in the large bowel than in the terminal ileum (p = 0.006), whereas lactobacilli were more prominent in the distal large intestine (p = 0.019). eubacterium rectale (p = 0.0004) and faecalibacterium prausnitzii (p = 0.001) were dominant in the ascending and descending colon. site-specific colonization in the gastrointestinal tract may be contributory in the etiology of some diseases of the large intestine.

TI  == quantitative analysis of the intestinal bacterial community in one- to three-week-old commercially reared broiler chickens fed conventional or antibiotic-free vegetable-based diets.
AB  == aims: to explore the effect of drug-free poultry production on the intestinal microflora of broiler chickens, the bacterial community of this environment was quantitatively profiled in both conventionally reared birds and birds reared without antibiotic growth promotants (agps) on a vegetable-based diet. methods and results: quantitative, real-time pcr with group-specific 16s rdna primer sets was used to enumerate the abundance of the following chicken gastrointestinal (gi) tract phylogenetic groups: the clostridium leptum-faecalibacterium prausnitzii subgroup (clostridium genus cluster iv), the clostridium coccoides -  eubacterium rectale subgroup (clostridium cluster xiva and xivb), the bacteroides group (including prevotella and porphyromonas), bifidobacterium spp., the enterobacteriaceae, the lactobacillus group (including the genera leuconostoc, pediococcus, aerococcus and weissella), the clostridium perfringens subgroup (clostridium cluster i), enterococcus spp., veillonella spp., atopobium spp., campylobacter spp. and the domain bacteria. a species-specific 5'-nuclease (taqman) assay was also employed to specifically assess cl. perfringens abundance. ten birds were sampled from each of two commercial chicken houses, one in which feed was supplemented with agps and exogenous animal protein, and the other vegetable-based and drug-free, at 7, 14 and 21 days of age. the ileal community was dominated by two large populations, the lactobacilli and the enterobacteriaceae, with those taxa much more numerous in drug-free vegetable-based diet fed birds than those conventionally reared at the 7- and 14-day time periods. the progressive changes in microflora in both the conventional and drug-free caeca were similar to each other, with the enterobacteriaceae sequences dominating at day 7, but being replaced by obligate  anaerobe signature sequences by day 14. of note was the finding that all the day  14 and day 21 replicate caecal samples from the drug-free house were positive for campylobacter spp. averaging >10(8) 16s rdna gene copies per gram wet weight. conclusions: quantitative, real-time pcr indicates that the effects of drug-free  rearing on the chicken gi tract microbial community are most pronounced in the ileal region, but agps may be important in controlling campylobacter colonization of the caecum. significance and impact of the study: a quantitative taxonomic understanding of the shifting microbial ecology of the broiler chicken gut microbiota is important in the light of agp withdrawal. agp withdrawal has occurred in response to concerns over the transfer of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria to humans via the food production chain.

AB  == the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (uc) remains unknown. it is thought to be  due to an abnormal and uncontrolled immune response to normally occurring constituents of the intestine. microbial agents appear to be involved in the pathogenesis and intestinal bacteria seem to be an important factor in the development and chronicity. the aim of this study was to investigate the colonic  microbiota of a patient with uc. the colonic tissues were taken during surgery from a 12-year-old girl suffering from uc. the microbiota on the colonic samples  was studied by cloning and sequencing of amplified 16s rrna genes. compared with  healthy subjects, alteration of the dominant bacterial group was observed in the  uc patient. we found a high incidence of enterobacteriaceae, bacteroides fragilis, and the single phylotype of the faecalibacterium prausnitzii-like "butyrate-producing bacterium" l2-6. furthermore, there was a substantial presence of pseudomonas aeruginosa in the present case of uc. the high proportion of adverse proinflammatory species is striking in the present case compared with  more normal situations. even if those bacteria are not the cause of the uc, they  most probably enhance the symptoms of the disease.

TI  == 16s rrna gene-based analysis of mucosa-associated bacterial community and phylogeny in the chicken gastrointestinal tracts: from crops to ceca.
AB  == mucosa-associated microbiota from different regions of the gastrointestinal (gi)  tract of adult broilers was studied by analysis of 16s rrna gene sequences. the microbiota mainly comprised gram-positive bacteria along the gi tract. fifty-one  operational taxonomic units (otus) (from 98 clones) were detected in the ceca, as compared with 13 otus (from 49 clones) in the crops, 11 otus (from 51 clones) in  the gizzard, 14 otus (from 52 clones) in the duodenum, 12 otus (from 50 clones) in the jejunum and nine otus (from 50 clones) in the ileum. ceca were dominantly  occupied by clostridia-related sequences (40%) with other abundant sequences being related to faecalibacterium prausnitzii (14%), escherichia coli (11%), lactobacilli (7%) and ruminococcus (6%). lactobacilli were predominant in the upper gi tract and had the highest diversity in the crop. both lactobacillus aviarius and lactobacillus salivarius were the predominant species among lactobacilli. candidatus division arthromitus was also abundant in the jejunum and ileum.

TI  == application of 16s rrna gene-targetted fluorescence in situ hybridization and restriction fragment length polymorphism to study porcine microbiota along the gastrointestinal tract in response to different sources of dietary fibre.
AB  == a total of 32 pigs of 15+/-0.38 kg body weight were fed for 6 weeks one of four diets differing in their source of dietary fibre. fish was used to quantify the main bacterial groups in the pig gut using the following probes: eub338, bac303,  rfla729, rbro730, erec482, fprau645, prop853, str493 and lab158. fish counts revealed important differences at four sites along the pig gastrointestinal tract, but we were unable to show differences related to diets. stomach and jejunal samples gave total bacterial counts of 0.1-5.3 x 10(8) g(-1) of contents. in the stomach, streptococci and lactobacilli were predominant, and the clostridial cluster ix group was abundant (14-41% of total bacterial count). clostridial cluster ix bacteria were present elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract at 1-8%. the other groups were generally more abundant in the proximal colon and rectum: bacteroides/prevotella (5-10%), clostridial cluster xiva (10-19%), and cluster iv relatives of faecalibacterium prausnitzii (1-4%) and ruminococcus (4-10%). restriction fragment length polymorphism profiles showed changes related to diet, with pigs fed wheat bran having the lowest richness of all diets (p=0.008).

TI  == molecular profiling of the clostridium leptum subgroup in human fecal microflora  by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and clone library analysis.
AB  == a group-specific pcr-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) method  was developed and combined with group-specific clone library analysis to investigate the diversity of the clostridium leptum subgroup in human feces. pcr  products (length, 239 bp) were amplified using c. leptum cluster-specific primers and were well separated by dgge. the dgge patterns of fecal amplicons from 11 human individuals revealed host-specific profiles; the patterns for fecal samples collected from a child for 3 years demonstrated the structural succession of the  population in the first 2 years and its stability in the third year. a clone library was constructed with 100 clones consisting of 1,143-bp inserts of 16s rrna gene fragments that were amplified from one adult fecal dna with one forward universal bacterial primer and one reverse group-specific primer. eighty-six of the clones produced the 239-bp c. leptum cluster-specific amplicons, and the remaining 14 clones did not produce these amplicons but still phylogenetically belong to the subgroup. sixty-four percent of the clones were related to faecalibacterium prausnitzii (similarity, 97 to 99%), 6% were related to subdoligranulum variabile (similarity, approximately 99%), 2% were related to butyrate-producing bacterium a2-207 (similarity, 99%), and 28% were not identified at the species level. the identities of most bands in the dgge profiles for the same adult were determined by comigration analysis with the 86 clones that harbored the 239-bp group-specific fragments. our results suggest that dgge combined with clone library analysis is an effective technique for monitoring and analyzing the composition of this important population in the human gut flora.

TI  == microbial community composition of the ileum and cecum of broiler chickens as revealed by molecular and culture-based techniques.
AB  == the microbial communities of the ileum and cecum of broiler chickens from a conventional and an organic farm were investigated using conventional culture techniques as well as cloning and sequencing of 16s rrna genes. eighty-five percent of the 557 cloned sequences were <97% related to known cultured species.  the chicken ileum was dominated by lactobacilli, whereas the cecum harbored a more diverse microbial community. the cecum was dominated by a large group of bacteria with hitherto no close cultured relatives but most closely related to faecalibacterium prausnitzii. approximately 49 and 20% of the cecal clones belonged to this cluster in conventional and organic broiler chickens, respectively. we were, however, able to recover a number of these phylotypes by cultivation, and the isolates were shown to be butyric acid producers. the investigation was a descriptive rather than a comparative study of 2 different rearing systems; however, several differences were observed. for instance, clostridium perfringens was found in significantly higher numbers in the birds from the organic farm compared with the conventional broilers, probably due to the addition of salinomycin to the conventional feed. in the ileum, the abundance of the different lactobacillus species differed between the 2 broiler types. the  culture-based and culture-independent techniques complemented each other well. strengths and limitations of the different methods are discussed.

TI  == subdoligranulum variabile gen. nov., sp. nov. from human feces.
AB  == during studies on the microflora of human feces we have isolated a strictly anaerobic, non-spore-forming, gram-negative staining organism which exhibits a somewhat variable coccus-shaped morphology. comparative 16s ribosomal rna gene sequencing studies show the unidentified organism is phylogenetically a member of the clostridium leptum supra-generic rrna cluster and displays a close affinity to some rdna clones derived from human and pig feces. the nearest named relatives of the unidentified isolate corresponded to faecalibacterium prausnitzii (formerly fusobacterium prausnitzii) displaying a 16s rrna sequence divergence of approximately 9%, with anaerofilum agile and a. pentosovorans the next closest relatives of the unidentified bacterium (sequence divergence approximately 10%).  based on phenotypic and phylogenetic considerations, it is proposed that the unusual coccoid-shaped organism be classified as a new genus and species, subdoligranulum variabile. the type strain of s. variabile is bi 114(t) (=ccug 47106(t)=dsm 15176(t)).

TI  == studies on the effect of system retention time on bacterial populations colonizing a three-stage continuous culture model of the human large gut using fish techniques.
AB  == fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to quantitate bacteria growing in a three-stage continuous culture system inoculated with human faeces, operated at two system retention times (60 and 20 h). twenty-three different 16s rrna gene oligonucleotide probes of varying specificities were used to detect bacteria. organisms belonging to genera bacteroides and bifidobacterium, together with the  eubacterium rectale/clostridium coccoides group, the atopobium, faecalibacterium  prausnitzii and eubacterium cylindroides groups, as well as the segmented filamentous bacteria, the roseburia intestinalis group and lactic acid bacteria,  were all present in high numbers in the continuous culture system. other groups and species such as ruminococci and enterobacteria also persisted in the model, though not always at levels that allowed reliable quantitation. some organisms such as streptococci and corynebacteria, present in the faecal inoculum, did not  colonize the system. other probes specific for eubacterium lentum and for members of the genus desulfovibrio did not detect these organisms at any time. short chain fatty acid production was always highest in vessel i of the continuous culture system, however, a marked increase in acetate formation and a reduction in butyrate production occurred when system retention time was reduced to 20 h, which correlated with reductions in the numbers of butyrate-producing roseburia.

TI  == characterisation of intestinal bacteria in infant stools using real-time pcr and  northern hybridisation analyses.
AB  == real-time pcr and northern hybridisations were used to quantify bacterial populations in the large gut of infants. pcr primers for rapid, sensitive, high throughput detection of bifidobacteria, bacteroides, sulphate-reducing bacteria and enterococcus faecalis, based on analysis of 16s rrna genes were used. bacterial populations were analysed in faeces from 40 infants aged 0-6, 7-12 and  13-24 months. the effects of breast versus bottle feeding was also investigated.  real-time pcr indicated that bacteroides and desulfovibrio numbers increased markedly in the 7-12 and 13-24 month age groups, and that the reverse occurred with ent. faecalis. with the exception of desulfovibrios, this was seen with northern hybridisations, which also showed increased colonisation by the clostridium coccoides group and faecalibacterium prausnitzii after 6 months. both methodologies indicated increased bifidobacteria in breast-fed babies, and higher levels of desulfovibrios in bottle-fed children.

TI  == isoflavones and functional foods alter the dominant intestinal microbiota in postmenopausal women.
AB  == dietary phytoestrogens, such as isoflavones, are used as food additives to prevent menopause-related disorders. in addition to other factors, their bioavailability strongly depends on the activity of intestinal bacteria but the underlying interactions remain poorly understood. a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was undertaken with 39 postmenopausal women to characterize changes in the dominant microbial communities of the intestinal tract after 2 mo of isoflavone supplementation with and without pro- or prebiotic. the diversity and composition of the dominant microbiota were analyzed by temporal temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (ttge) and fluorescent in situ hybridization. isoflavones alone stimulated dominant microorganisms of the clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale cluster, lactobacillus-enterococcus group, faecalibacterium prausnitzii subgroup, and bifidobacterium genus. the stimulation of the clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale cluster depended on  the women's equol excretion and was transient, with the exception of a prolonged  bifidogenic effect. lasting changes in the diversity of the dominant species were also observed. the probiotic strain supplied could be detected by ttge during its passage through the intestinal tract, and ingestion of fructooligosaccharides triggered a marked and specific bifidogenic effect. in conclusion, this is the first human study that shows changes in the diversity and composition of dominant bacterial communities in response to dietary supplementation with hormone-related compounds combined with functional foods.

TI  == design and validation of 16s rrna probes to enumerate members of the clostridium  leptum subgroup in human faecal microbiota.
AB  == among human faecal bacteria, many members of the clostridium leptum subgroup are  fibrolytic and butyrate producing microorganisms thereby contributing to processes important to colonic health. yet this phylogenetic subgroup remains poorly described to date. to improve detection and description of members of the  c. leptum subgroup, the clep 866 group probe was developed. its association with  probes targeting the clostridium viride cluster (cvir 1414) and eubacterium desmolans species (edes 635) allowed for the first time the detection of all members found in this phylogenetic group in human faecal microbiota. a species-specific probe was also designed to detect members of the ruminococcus callidus species (rcal 733). the design of signature regions was based on alignment of 16s rrna sequences isolated from faeces of five healthy adults. furthermore, an oligonucleotide competitor strategy was developed in order to improve the specificity of the probes formerly validated or designed in this study. the oligonucleotide probes were tested using a collection of target and non-target strains using fish combined with flow cytometry. these new probes were added to a panel of 18 phylogenetic probes selected to describe faecal microbiota composition in 21 human faeces of healthy adults. clostridium leptum subgroup represented 22% of the total faecal bacteria and codominated with members of clostridium coccoides group. the cluster faecalibacterium prausnitzii was the dominant component of the c. leptum subgroup and 20% of the latter subgroup remained unidentified at the species level.

TI  == lactate-utilizing bacteria, isolated from human feces, that produce butyrate as a major fermentation product.
AB  == the microbial community of the human colon contains many bacteria that produce lactic acid, but lactate is normally detected only at low concentrations (<5 mm)  in feces from healthy individuals. it is not clear, however, which bacteria are mainly responsible for lactate utilization in the human colon. here, bacteria able to utilize lactate and produce butyrate were identified among isolates obtained from 10(-8) dilutions of fecal samples from five different subjects. out of nine such strains identified, four were found to be related to eubacterium hallii and two to anaerostipes caccae, while the remaining three represent a new  species within clostridial cluster xiva based on their 16s rrna sequences. significant ability to utilize lactate was not detected in the butyrate-producing species roseburia intestinalis, eubacterium rectale, or faecalibacterium prausnitzii. whereas e. hallii and a. caccae strains used both d- and l-lactate,  the remaining strains used only the d form. addition of glucose to batch cultures prevented lactate utilization until the glucose became exhausted. however, when two e. hallii strains and one a. caccae strain were grown in separate cocultures  with a starch-utilizing bifidobacterium adolescentis isolate, with starch as the  carbohydrate energy source, the l-lactate produced by b. adolescentis became undetectable and butyrate was formed. such cross-feeding may help to explain the  reported butyrogenic effect of certain dietary substrates, including resistant starch. the abundance of e. hallii in particular in the colonic ecosystem suggests that these bacteria play important roles in preventing lactate accumulation.

TI  == validation of fluorescent in situ hybridization combined with flow cytometry for  assessing interindividual variation in the composition of human fecal microflora  during long-term storage of samples.
AB  == this work was conducted to assess the accuracy of in situ hybridization to show differences in human microflora composition between volunteers and to optimize the storage of fecal samples to allow delayed analysis of gut microflora composition in humans. fecal samples from 25 healthy subjects (14 women, 11 men aged 24-51) were collected. the samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (pfa) solution at 4 degrees c overnight and stored at -70 degrees c. twenty samples were analysed to quantify the variation due to interindividual differences in the composition of fecal microflora. the five remaining samples were stored either after pfa fixation or directly frozen at -70 degrees c and were monitored on a 12-month period. the fecal microflora was analysed by in situ hybridization combined with flow cytometry detection. ribosomal rna-targeted probes were used to assess the relative proportions of four phylogenetic groups: clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale (erec 482), bacteroides (bac 303), faecalibacterium prausnitzii (fprau 645) and bifidobacterium (bif 164). our results demonstrated that the method used is adapted to detect significant differences in fecal microflora composition in humans. moreover, samples stored in pfa solution demonstrated a stable composition even after 8 months of storage. conversely, frozen samples were less stable as the bifidobacterium and c. coccoides-e. rectale groups showed significant differences after 2 months of storage. in conclusion, the fecal microflora composition can be analysed up to 8 months after 4% pfa fixation and storage at -70 degrees c. it represents an extended time compared with the 2-month period currently recommended. this will give more flexibility for applying this technology in epidemiological studies including a large number of samples.

TI  == characterization of bacterial communities in feces from healthy elderly volunteers and hospitalized elderly patients by using real-time pcr and effects of antibiotic treatment on the fecal microbiota.
AB  == fecal bacteria were studied in healthy elderly volunteers (age, 63 to 90 years; n = 35) living in the local community, elderly hospitalized patients (age, 66 to 103; n = 38), and elderly hospitalized patients receiving antibiotic treatment (age, 65 to 100; n = 21). group- and species-specific primer sets targeting 16s rrna genes were used to quantitate intestinal bacteria by using dna extracted from feces and real-time pcr. the principal difference between healthy elderly volunteers and both patient cohorts was a marked reduction in the bacteroides-prevotella group following hospitalization. reductions in bifidobacteria, desulfovibrio spp., clostridium clostridiiforme, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were also found in the hospitalized patients. however, total 16s rrna gene copy numbers (per gram of wet weight of feces) were  generally lower in the stool samples of the two groups of hospitalized patients compared to the number in the stool samples of elderly volunteers living in the community, so the relative abundance (percentage of the group- and species-specific rrna gene copies in relation to total bacterial rrna gene copies) of bifidobacteria, desulfovibrio spp., c. clostridiiforme, and f. prausnitzii did not change. antibiotic treatment resulted in further reductions in the numbers of bacteria and their prevalence and, in some patients, complete elimination of certain bacterial communities. conversely, the numbers of enterobacteria increased in the hospitalized patients who did not receive antibiotics, and due to profound changes in fecal microbiotas during antibiotic treatment, the opportunistic species enterococcus faecalis proliferated.

TI  == contribution of acetate to butyrate formation by human faecal bacteria.
AB  == acetate is normally regarded as an endproduct of anaerobic fermentation, but butyrate-producing bacteria found in the human colon can be net utilisers of acetate. the butyrate formed provides a fuel for epithelial cells of the large intestine and influences colonic health. [1-(13)c]acetate was used to investigate the contribution of exogenous acetate to butyrate formation. faecalibacterium prausnitzii and roseburia spp. grown in the presence of 60 mm-acetate and 10 mm-glucose derived 85-90 % butyrate-c from external acetate. this was due to rapid interchange between extracellular acetate and intracellular acetyl-coa, plus net acetate uptake. in contrast, a coprococcus-related strain that is a net  acetate producer derived only 28 % butyrate-c from external acetate. different carbohydrate-derived energy sources affected butyrate formation by mixed human faecal bacteria growing in continuous or batch cultures. the ranking order of butyrate production rates was amylopectin > oat xylan > shredded wheat > inulin > pectin (continuous cultures), and inulin > amylopectin > oat xylan > shredded wheat > pectin (batch cultures). the contribution of external acetate to butyrate formation in these experiments ranged from 56 (pectin) to 90 % (xylan) in continuous cultures, and from 72 to 91 % in the batch cultures. this is consistent with a major role for bacteria related to f. prausnitzii and roseburia spp. in butyrate formation from a range of substrates that are fermented in the large intestine. variations in the dominant metabolic type of butyrate producer between individuals or with variations in diet are not ruled out, however, and could influence butyrate supply in the large intestine.

TI  == oligonucleotide probes that detect quantitatively significant groups of butyrate-producing bacteria in human feces.
AB  == 16s rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes were designed for butyrate-producing bacteria from human feces. three new cluster-specific probes detected bacteria related to roseburia intestinalis, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and eubacterium  hallii at mean populations of 2.3, 3.8, and 0.6%, respectively, in samples from 10 individuals. additional species-level probes accounted for no more than 1%, with a mean of 7.7%, of the total human fecal microbiota identified as butyrate producers in this study. bacteria related to e. hallii and the genera roseburia and faecalibacterium are therefore among the most abundant known butyrate-producing bacteria in human feces.

TI  == effects of alternative dietary substrates on competition between human colonic bacteria in an anaerobic fermentor system.
AB  == duplicate anaerobic fermentor systems were used to examine changes in a community of human fecal bacteria supplied with different carbohydrate energy sources. a panel of group-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization probes targeting 16s rrna sequences revealed that the fermentors supported growth of a greater proportion of bacteroides and a lower proportion of gram-positive anaerobes related to faecalibacterium prausnitzii, ruminococcus flavefaciens-ruminococcus bromii, eubacterium rectale-clostridium coccoides, and eubacterium cylindroides than the proportions in the starting fecal inoculum. nevertheless, certain substrates, such as dahlia inulin, caused a pronounced increase in the number of  bacteria related to r. flavefaciens-r. bromii and e. cylindroides. the ability of three strictly anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria to compete with the complete human fecal flora was tested in the same experiment by using selective plating to enumerate the introduced strains. the roseburia-related strain a2-183(f) was able to grow on all substrates despite the fact that it was unable to utilize complex  carbohydrates in pure culture, and it was assumed that this organism survived by  cross-feeding. in contrast, roseburia intestinalis l1-82(r) and eubacterium sp. strain a2-194(r) survived less well despite the fact that they were able to utilize polysaccharides in pure culture, except that a2-194(r) was stimulated 100-fold by inulin. these results suggest that many low-g+c-content gram-positive obligate anaerobes may be selected against during in vitro incubation, although several groups were stimulated by inulin. thus, considerable caution is necessary when workers attempt to predict the in vivo effects of probiotics and prebiotics  from their effects in vitro.

TI  == growth requirements and fermentation products of fusobacterium prausnitzii, and a proposal to reclassify it as faecalibacterium prausnitzii gen. nov., comb. nov.
AB  == two newly isolated strains of obligately anaerobic bacteria from human faeces are shown here to be related to fusobacterium prausnitzii, which is regarded as one of the most abundant colonizers of the human colon. these strains, along with fusobacterium prausnitzii atcc 27768(t) and 27766, are non-motile and produce butyrate, formate and lactate, but not hydrogen as fermentation products. a new finding is that all four strains produce d-lactate, but not l-lactate. the strains have a requirement for acetate in the growth medium and this may account  for the previously reported requirement for rumen fluid. the dna g+c content of the four strains is 47-57 mol%. together with phylogenetic analysis based on 16s  rrna sequencing, this establishes that fusobacterium prausnitzii strains are only distantly related to fusobacterium sensu stricto and are more closely related to  members of clostridium cluster iv (the clostridium leptum group). it is proposed  that a new genus, faecalibacterium gen. nov. be created; this genus should include faecalibacterium prausnitzii gen. nov., comb. nov. atcc 27768(t) (= ncimb 13872(t)) (formerly fusobacterium prausnitzii) as the type species together with  atcc 27766 and the newly isolated strains a2-165 and l2-6.
