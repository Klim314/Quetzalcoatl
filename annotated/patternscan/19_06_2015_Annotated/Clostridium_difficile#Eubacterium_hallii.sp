TI  == essential oils have different effects on human pathogenic and commensal bacteria  in mixed faecal fermentations compared with pure cultures.
AB  == a static batch culture system inoculated with human faeces was used to determine  the influence of essential oil compounds (eocs) on mixed faecal microbiota. bacteria were quantified using quantitative pcr of 16s rrna genes. incubation for 24 h of diluted faeces from six individuals caused enrichment of bifidobacterium  spp., but proportions of other major groups were unaffected. thymol and geraniol  at 500 p.p.m. suppressed total bacteria, resulting in minimal fermentation. thymol at 100 p.p.m. had no effect, nor did eugenol or nerolidol at 100 or 500 p.p.m. except for a slight suppression of eubacterium hallii. methyl isoeugenol at 100 or 500 p.p.m. suppressed the growth of total bacteria, accompanied by a large fall in the molar proportion of propionate formed. the relative abundance of faecalibacterium prausnitzii was unaffected except with thymol at 500 p.p.m. the ability of eocs to control numbers of the pathogen clostridium difficile was  investigated in a separate experiment, in which the faecal suspensions were amended by the addition of pure culture of c. difficile. numbers of c. difficile  were suppressed by thymol and methyl isoeugenol at 500 p.p.m. and to a lesser extent at 100 p.p.m. eugenol and geraniol gave rather similar suppression of c. difficile numbers at both 100 and 500 p.p.m. nerolidol had no significant effect. it was concluded from these and previous pure-culture experiments that thymol and geraniol at around 100 p.p.m. could be effective in suppressing pathogens in the  small intestine, with no concern for beneficial commensal colonic bacteria in the distal gut.
