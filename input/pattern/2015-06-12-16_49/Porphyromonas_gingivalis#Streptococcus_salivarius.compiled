TI  - Novel antimicrobial peptide specifically active against Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis, the major etiologic agent of chronic periodontitis, produces a broad spectrum of virulence factors, including outer membrane vesicles, lipopolysaccharides, hemolysins and proteinases. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) including bacteriocins have been found to inhibit the growth of P. gingivalis; however, these peptides are relatively large molecules. Hence, it is difficult to synthesize them by a scale-up production. Therefore, this study aimed to synthesize a shorter AMP that was still active against P. gingivalis. A peptide that contained three cationic amino acids (Arg, His and Lys), two anionic amino acids (Glu and Asp), hydrophobic amino acids residues (Leu, Ile, Val, Ala and Pro) and hydrophilic residues (Ser and Gly) was obtained and named Pep-7. Its bioactivity and stability were tested after various treatments. The mechanism of action of Pep-7 and its toxicity to human red blood cells were investigated. The Pep-7 inhibited two pathogenic P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 and P. gingivalis ATCC 53978 (wp50) strains at a minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of 1.7 microM, but was ineffective against other oral microorganisms (P. intermedia, Tannerella forsythensis, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus sanguinis). From transmission electron microscopy studies, Pep-7 caused pore formation at the poles of the cytoplasmic membranes of P. gingivalis. A concentration of Pep-7 at four times that of its MBC induced some hemolysis but only at 0.3 %. The Pep-7 was heat stable under pressure (autoclave at 110 and 121 degrees C) and possessed activity over a pH range of 6.8-8.5. It was not toxic to periodontal cells over a range of 70.8-4.4 muM and did not induce toxic pro-inflammatory cytokines. The Pep-7 showed selective activity against Porphyromonas sp. by altering the permeability barriers of P. gingivalis. The Pep-7 was not mutagenic in vitro. This work highlighted the potential for the use of this synthetic Pep-7 against P. gingivalis.
TI  - Regulation of adrenomedullin and nitric oxide production by periodontal bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In periodontitis the host response to bacterial challenge includes activity of the multifunctional molecules adrenomedullin (AM) and nitric oxide (NO). The aim of this study was to investigate the role of periodontal bacteria in regulating the production of these molecules from cultured cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Regulation of AM and NO production from oral keratinocytes when challenged with culture supernatants from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter rectus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Veillonella atypica, Streptococcus salivarius and Candida albicans was examined. AM and NO were measured in cell culture supernatants using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the nitrate/nitrite (NO metabolites) Griess assay respectively. Cellular production of AM and inducible NO synthase was also analysed in target cells by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. The inter-relationship of AM and NO production were further investigated with macrophages. RESULTS: A. actinomycetemcomitans and C. rectus induced maximal levels of both AM and NO after 6 and 48 h respectively from oral keratinocytes. AM production in macrophages was upregulated in response to the NO donor S-nitrosoglutathione and partially blocked by the inducible NO synthase inhibitor, Nomega -Nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride. Likewise, NO production was increased upon exposure to AM, while the AM receptor antagonist AM 22-52 reduced the release of NO. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogens associated with aggressive periodontitis, A. actinomycetemcomitans and C. rectus, were more effective than those associated with chronic periodontitis, P. gingivalis and Prev. intermedia, and commensals, S. salivarius and V. atypica, as regards the upregulation of AM and NO production from oral keratinocytes. Interaction between these molecules was also demonstrated with macrophages. Understanding the coordinated regulation of AM and NO production in response to periodontal bacteria may identify ways to promote their protective effects and minimize destructive potential.
TI  - Molecular identification and antibiotic resistant bacteria isolated from primary  dentition infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a health problem in many parts of the world. The aim of this study was to identify bacteria from dental infections and determine bacterial resistance to antibiotics used in dental care in the primary dentition. METHODS: This cross-sectional study comprised 60 children who presented for dental treatment for active dental infections in the primary dentition. Samples from dental infections were collected and bacteria were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics was determined by colony forming units on agar plates containing amoxicillin, clindamycin and amoxillicin-clavulanic acid (A-CA) tested at 8 mug/ml or 16 mug/ml. RESULTS: Clindamycin in both concentrations tested (8 mug/ml and 16 mug/ml) showed the highest bacterial resistance (85.9%), followed by amoxicillin (43.7%) and A-CA (12.0%). All comparisons among the three antibiotics used in the study exhibited statistical significance (p = <0.05) in both concentrations tested (8 mug/ml and 16 mug/ml), and under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The most prevalent resistant species identified by PCR in primary dentition infections were: Streptococcus oralis and Prevotella intermedia (75.0%); Treponema denticola and Porphyromonas gingivalis (48.3%); Streptococcus mutans (45.0%); Campylobacter rectus; and Streptococcus salivarius (40%). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that A-CA exhibited the lowest bacterial resistance for clinical isolates in primary dentition infections.
TI  - Photodynamic therapy versus ultrasonic irrigation: interaction with endodontic microbial biofilm, an ex vivo study.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Photodynamic therapy was introduced as an adjuvant to conventional  chemo-mechanical debridement during endodontic treatment to overcome the persistence of biofilms. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of photodynamic therapy (PDT) to disrupt an experimental microbial biofilm inside the root canal in a clinically applicable working time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty extracted teeth were prepared and then divided in three groups. All samples were infected with an artificially formed biofilm made of Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus salivarius, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia bacteria. First group was treated with Aseptim Plus(R) photo-activated (LED) disinfection system, second group by a 650 nm Diode Laser and Toluidine blue as photosensitizer, and the third group, as control group, by ultrasonic irrigation (PUI) using EDTA 17% and NaOCl 2.6% solutions. The working time for all three groups was fixed at 3 min. Presence or absence of biofilm was assessed by aerobic and anaerobic cultures. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between results obtained from groups treated by Aseptim Plus(R) and Diode Laser (P<0.6267). In cultures of both groups there was a maximal bacterial growth. The group that was treated by ultrasonic irrigation and NaOCl and EDTA solutions had the best results (P<0.0001): there was a statistically significant reduction of bacterial load and destruction of microbial biofilm. CONCLUSION: Under the condition of this study, Photodynamic therapy could not disrupt endodontic artificial microbial biofilm and could not inhibit bacterial growth in a clinically favorable working time.
TI  - In vitro antagonistic growth effects of Lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus salivarius and their fermentative broth on periodontal pathogens.
AB  - As lactobacilli possess an antagonistic growth property, these bacteria may be beneficial as bioprotective agents for infection control. However, whether the antagonistic growth effects are attributed to the lactobacilli themselves or their fermentative broth remains unclear. The antagonistic growth effects of Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus fermentum as well as their fermentative broth were thus tested using both disc agar diffusion test and broth dilution method, and their effects on periodontal pathogens, including Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis in vitro at different concentrations and for different time periods were also compared. Both Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus fermentum and their concentrated fermentative broth were shown to inhibit significantly the growth of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, although different inhibitory effects were observed for different pathogens. The higher the counts of lactobacilli and the higher the folds of concentrated fermentative broth, the stronger the inhibitory effects are observed. The inhibitory effect is demonstrated to be dose-dependent. Moreover, for the lactobacilli themselves, Lactobacillus fermentum showed stronger inhibitory effects than Lactobacillus salivarius. However, the fermentative broth of Lactobacillus fermentum showed weaker inhibitory effects than that of Lactobacillus salivarius. These data suggested that lactobacilli and their fermentative broth exhibit antagonistic growth activity, and consumption of probiotics or their broth containing lactobacilli may benefit oral health.
TI  - The surface layer of Tannerella forsythia contributes to serum resistance and oral bacterial coaggregation.
AB  - Tannerella forsythia is an anaerobic, Gram-negative bacterium involved in the so-called "red complex," which is associated with severe and chronic periodontitis. The surface layer (S-layer) of T. forsythia is composed of cell surface glycoproteins, such as TfsA and TfsB, and is known to play a role in adhesion/invasion and suppression of proinflammatory cytokine expression. Here we investigated the association of this S-layer with serum resistance and coaggregation with other oral bacteria. The growth of the S-layer-deficient mutant in a bacterial medium containing more than 20% non-heat-inactivated calf serum (CS) or more than 40% non-heat-inactivated human serum was significantly suppressed relative to that of the wild type (WT). Next, we used confocal microscopy to perform quantitative analysis on the effect of serum. The survival ratio of the mutant exposed to 100% non-heat-inactivated CS (76% survival) was significantly lower than that of the WT (97% survival). Furthermore, significant C3b deposition was observed in the mutant but not in the WT. In a coaggregation assay, the mutant showed reduced coaggregation with Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus salivarius, and Porphyromonas gingivalis but strong coaggregation with Fusobacterium nucleatum. These results indicated that the S-layer of T. forsythia plays multiple roles in virulence and may be associated with periodontitis.
TI  - Evaluation of bacterial adhesion on machined titanium, Osseotite(R) and Nanotite(R) discs.
AB  - PURPOSE: Bacterial adhesion and colonization play a crucial function in the pathogenesis of peri-implant tissue infection, which is considered the main cause of fixture loss. The aim of this study is to evaluate the differences in bacterial adhesion between a machined titanium surface, a double acid etched surface (Osseotite(R)) and an Osseotite surface with Nanometer-scale Discrete Crystalline Deposition (DCD) of calcium phosphate (CaP)(Nanotite(R)). METHODS: Surface roughness properties of each sample were determined by a laser profilometer and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation. Bacterial adhesion on machined, Osseotite(R), and Nanotite(R) discs were performed using the following bacterial strains: Streptococcus mutans CCUG 35176, Streptococcus sanguis CCUG 17826, Streptococcus salivarius CCUG 11878, Actinobacillus actinomycetecomitans CCUG 37002, Porphyromonas gingivalis CCUG 2521. The assessment of bacterial adhesion was performed by comparing two methods: Total Viable Count (TVC) estimation and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopic (CSLM) studies. RESULTS: The surface roughness parameter increased as follows: machined<Nanotite(R)<Osseotite(R). The attachment of all bacterial strains performed by both methods showed a significant reduction on Osseotite(R) and even higher on Nanotite(R) in comparison to machined surfaces (p<0.05). The reduction in bacterial attachment was more significant on Osseotite(R) and Nanotite(R) for A. actinomycetecomitans, S. mutans and S. sanguis than for P. gingivalis and S. salivarius strains. CONCLUSIONS: Nanotite(R) samples showed the lowest amount of bacterial contamination in comparison to the smoother machined and rougher Osseotite(R) surfaces.
TI  - Antibacterial Activity of Myristica fragrans against Oral Pathogens.
AB  - Myristica fragrans Houtt is mostly cultivated for spices in Penang Island, Malaysia. The ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts of flesh, mace and seed of Myristica fragrans was evaluated the bactericidal potential against three Gram-positive cariogenic bacteria (Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus mitis ATCC 6249, and Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419) and three Gram-negative periodontopathic bacteria (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 29522, Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277, and Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25586). Antibacterial activities of the extracts was determined by twofold serial microdilution, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 1.25 to 640 mg/mL and 0.075 to 40 mg/mL. The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was obtained by subculturing method. Among all extracts tested, ethyl acetate extract of flesh has the highest significant inhibitory effects against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with mean MIC value ranging from 0.625 to 1.25 +/- 0.00 (SD) mg/mL; P = 0.017) and highest bactericidal effects at mean MBC value ranging from 0.625 mg/mL to 20 +/- 0.00 (SD) mg/mL. While for seed and mace of Myristica fragrans, their ethanol extracts exhibited good antibacterial activity against both groups of test pathogens compared to its ethyl acetate extracts. All of the extracts of Myristica fragrans did not show any antibacterial activities against Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25586. Thus, our study showed the potential effect of ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts from flesh, seed and mace of Myristica fragrans to be new natural agent that can be incorporated in oral care products.
TI  - In Vitro Antibacterial Activity of Galls of Quercus infectoria Olivier against Oral Pathogens.
AB  - The galls of Quercus infectoria are commonly used in Malay traditional medicine to treat wound infections after childbirth. In India, they are employed traditionally as dental applications such as that in treatment of toothache and gingivitis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of galls of Quercus infectoria Olivier against oral bacteria which are known to cause dental caries and periodontitis. Methanol and acetone extracts were screened against two Gram-positive bacteria (Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175 and Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419) and two Gram-negative bacteria (Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277 and Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25586). The screening test of antibacterial activity was performed using agar-well diffusion method. Subsequently, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by using twofold serial microdilution method at a concentration ranging between 0.01 mg/mL and 5 mg/mL. Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was obtained by subculturing microtiter wells which showed no changes in colour of the indicator after incubation. Both extracts showed inhibition zones which did not differ significantly (P < 0.05) against each tested bacteria. Among all tested bacteria, S. salivarius was the most susceptible. The MIC ranges for methanol and acetone extracts were the same, between 0.16 and 0.63 mg/mL. The MBC value, for methanol and acetone extracts, was in the ranges 0.31-1.25 mg/mL and 0.31-2.50 mg/mL, respectively. Both extracts of Q. infectoria galls exhibited similar antibacterial activity against oral pathogens. Thus, the galls may be considered as effective phytotherapeutic agents for the prevention of oral pathogens.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of oral Lactobacillus against oral pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the inhibitory effect of oral Lactobacillus against putative oral pathogens. METHODS AND RESULTS: Total 357 strains comprising 10 species of oral Lactobacillus, Lactobacillus fermentum (195), Lactobacillus salivarius (53), Lactobacillus casei (20), Lactobacillus gasseri (18), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (14), Lactobacillus paracasei (12), Lactobacillus mucosae (12), Lactobacillus oris (12), Lactobacillus plantarum (11) and Lactobacillus vaginalis (10) were used as producer strains. Inhibitory effect against a panel of indicators, periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens, was assessed. Most oral Lactobacillus was able to inhibit the growth of both periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens. The strongest inhibitory activity was associated with Lact. paracasei, Lact. plantarum, Lact. rhamnosus, Lact. casei and Lact. salivarius. Lactobacillus SD1-SD6, representing the six species with the strong inhibitory effect, inhibited growth of Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175 in the biofilm model. Also, it was demonstrated that growth of Strep. mutans was inhibited in a mixture with Lact. paracasei SD1. The inhibition was enhanced in acidic condition and 5% glucose. CONCLUSIONS: The results have shown that oral Lactobacillus SD1-SD6 showed a strong inhibitory effect against Strep. mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus, as well as, Gram-negative periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results indicated that Lactobacillus may be of benefit as probiotics for the prevention of oral diseases.
TI  - B7-H1 and B7-DC receptors of oral squamous carcinoma cells are upregulated by Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - The up-regulation of the B7-H1 receptors in host cells might influence the chronicity of inflammatory disorders that frequently precede the development of human cancers. B7-H1 expression has been detected in the majority of human cancers, leading to anergy and apoptosis of activated T cells, and enabling tumor cells to overcome host response. Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), a putative periodontal pathogen, is an etiologic agent of periodontitis and expresses a variety of virulence factors. In this study, the expression of B7-H1 and B7-DC receptors on squamous cell carcinoma cells SCC-25 and BHY and primary human gingival keratinocytes (PHGK) was analyzed after infection with two virulent P. gingivalis strains in vitro. After 48h, the cells were stained with antibodies for human B7-H1 and B7-DC and further analyzed by flow cytometry. RNA was extracted and gene expression of B7-H1 or B7-DC was quantified by real time PCR. After infection with P. gingivalis, both B7-H1 and B7-DC receptors were up-regulated. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) increased from 4.5 to 9.9 (B7-H1) and from 6.9 to 15.0 (B7-DC) (p<0.05, respectively) in SCC-25 cells. PHGK showed an increase from 4.8 to 12.4 (B7-H1) and from 5.5 to 15.6 (B7-DC) (p<0.05, respectively). Streptococcus salivarius K12, a commensal bacterium, caused no up-regulation. After 24h, the expression of B7H1 and B7-DC mRNA in infected cells, normalized to GAPDH and in relation to non-infected cells, was 6.4 fold (B7-H1) and 8.6 fold (B7-DC) higher. In PHGK B7-H1/DC mRNA expression increased 8.2 fold (B7-H1) and 5.9 fold (B7DC) (p<0.05) respectively. The results of the study demonstrate that in contrast to S. salivarius K12 virulent P. gingivalis strains are able to induce the expression of the B7-H1 and B7-DC receptors in squamous carcinoma cells and human gingival keratinocytes, which might facilitate immune evasion by oral cancers.
TI  - Setup of an in vitro test system for basic studies on biofilm behavior of mixed-species cultures with dental and periodontal pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Caries and periodontitis are important human diseases associated with formation of multi-species biofilms. The involved bacteria are intensively studied to understand the molecular basis of the interactions in such biofilms. This study established a basic in vitro single and mixed-species culture model for oral bacteria combining three complimentary methods. The setup allows a rapid screening for effects in the mutual species interaction. Furthermore, it is easy to handle, inexpensive, and reproducible. METHODS: Streptococcus mitis, S. salivarius and S. sanguinis, typical inhabitants of the healthy oral cavity, S. mutans as main carriogenic species, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, S. intermedius and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as periodontitis-associated bacteria, were investigated for their biofilm forming ability. Different liquid growth media were evaluated. Safranin-staining allowed monitoring of biofilm formation under the chosen conditions. Viable counts and microscopy permitted investigation of biofilm behavior in mixed-species and transwell setups. FINDINGS: S. mitis, F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis and P. micra failed to form biofilm structures. S. mutans, S. sanguinis, S. intermedius and S. salivarius established abundant biofilm masses in CDM/sucrose. A. actinomycetemcomitans formed patchy monolayers. For in depth analysis S. mitis, S. mutans and A. actinomycetemcomitans were chosen, because i) they are representatives of the physiological-, cariogenic and periodontitis-associated bacterial flora, respectively and ii) their difference in their biofilm forming ability. Microscopic analysis confirmed the results of safranin staining. Investigation of two species combinations of S. mitis with either S. mutans or A. actinomycetemcomitans revealed bacterial interactions influencing biofilm mass, biofilm structure and cell viability. CONCLUSIONS: This setup shows safranin staining, microscopic analysis and viable counts together are crucial for basic examination and evaluation of biofilms. Our experiment generated meaningful results, exemplified by the noted S. mitis influence, and allows a fast decision about the most important bacterial interactions which should be investigated in depth.
TI  - Effects of probiotic Lactobacillus salivarius WB21 on halitosis and oral health:  an open-label pilot trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether oral administration of lactobacilli alters the degree of halitosis and clinical conditions associated with halitosis. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty patients with genuine halitosis were given 2.0 x 10(9)Lactobacillus salivarius WB21 and xylitol in tablet form daily. Oral malodor and clinical parameters were evaluated at the same time of day for each patient after 2 and 4 weeks. RESULTS: All 20 patients were positive for L. salivarius DNA in their saliva at 2 weeks, although 12 patients were negative for this organism at baseline. Oral malodor parameters significantly decreased at 2 weeks in the subjects with physiologic halitosis. The scores of an organoleptic test and bleeding on probing significantly decreased at 4 weeks in the subjects with oral pathologic halitosis. CONCLUSIONS: Oral administration of probiotic lactobacilli primarily improved physiologic halitosis and also showed beneficial effects on bleeding on probing from the periodontal pocket.
TI  - DIAGNOdent measurements of cultures of selected oral bacteria and demineralized enamel.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Carious tissue fluoresces with a wavelength different from sound tissue when stimulated by light with a wavelength of 655 nm. This difference is thought to have a bacterial origin rather than indicating demineralization. This study aimed to measure fluorescence emitted by normal cultivable caries-associated bacterial flora and typical porphyrin-producing bacteria with DIAGNOdent, and to verify earlier findings that demineralization of the dental hard tissue does not affect DIAGNOdent readings. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bacterial samples were collected from five occlusal caries lesions in three subjects. From these, mixed anaerobic flora, Lactobacilli and mutans Streptococci were cultured in up to three different kinds of culture medium. Colonies of Lactobacilli and mutans Streptococci were also measured after transferring them to glass slides. Laboratory teaching strains of Prevotella spp., Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinomyces odontolyticus were cultured anaerobically and fluorescence measured directly after an appropriate incubation period. Sound enamel surfaces of 15 extracted premolars were demineralized and changes in fluorescence measured. RESULTS: DIAGNOdent readings > 20 were only obtained from young colonies of Prevotella and from colonies of mutans Streptococci cultured on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. Higher measurements were obtained as the bacterial colonies aged. Lower measurements were obtained after transferring colonies to glass slides. Demineralization of enamel did not affect the DIAGNOdent measurements. CONCLUSIONS: The change in fluorescence measured with DIAGNOdent has a bacterial origin rather than occurring as a result of demineralization. The measurements are presumably dependent on bacterial metabolites rather than bacteria themselves, and probably record synergistic effects during the carious process rather than the quantity or species of bacteria involved.
TI  - Comparative analysis of putative periodontopathic bacteria by multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been applied for the rapid and specific detection of periodontopathic bacteria in subgingival plaque and is potentially of clinical benefit in the diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis subjects. However, several technical points need to be modified before the conventional PCR detection system can be used by clinicians. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To develop a PCR-based technique more applicable for clinical use than conventional PCR, we established a multiplex PCR for five putative periodontopathic (Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia and Tannerella forsythia) and two nonperiodontopathic (Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus salivarius) species of bacteria using whole-plaque suspension as templates, and detected bacteria in subgingival plaque taken from 85 subjects at the supportive periodontal therapy stage after active periodontal treatments. RESULTS: Among putative periodontopathic bacteria, the detection frequency of T. denticola and P. gingivalis was elevated in parallel with higher probing pocket depth and clinical attachment loss, and had 4.2-14.1 times increasing odds of the clinical parameters tested. Detection of any of the five species of putative periodontopathic bacteria markedly increased the odds ratio of a higher probing pocket depth, clinical attachment loss and bleeding on probing. CONCLUSION: The multiplex PCR system developed in this study enabled the detection of all the bacteria under investigation in one reaction tube in a less time- and labor-intensive manner than conventional PCR. These results support the potential clinical use of multiplex PCR for detecting periodontopathic bacteria and for evaluating therapeutic strategies and predicting the prognosis for each subject.
TI  - Characterization of oral lactobacilli as potential probiotics for oral health.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Intestinal lactobacilli have been successfully used as probiotics to treat gastrointestinal disorders, but only limited data are available for the probiotic properties of oral lactobacilli to combat oral diseases. We aimed to characterize oral lactobacilli for their potential probiotic properties according to the international guidelines for the evaluation of probiotics, and to select potential probiotic strains for oral health. METHODS: The study included 67 salivary and subgingival lactobacilli of 10 species, isolated from healthy humans. All strains were identified using amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis, tested for antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens, tolerance of low pH and bile content. Thereafter, the lysozyme tolerance and antibiotic susceptibility of 22 potential probiotic strains were assessed. RESULTS: The majority of strains suppressed the growth of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Streptococcus mutans, but none inhibited Candida albicans. The lowest pH tolerated by lactobacilli following 4 h of incubation was pH 2.5, but none of the strains grew at this pH. All strains tolerated a high concentration of lysozyme (10 mg/ml) and half of the strains tolerated a high concentration of human bile [5% volume/volume (V/V)]. Four Lactobacillus plantarum and two Lactobacillus oris strains expressed resistance to tetracycline and/or doxycycline. CONCLUSIONS: Strains of L. plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus expressed both high antimicrobial activity and high tolerance of environmental stress. The absence of transferable antibiotic-resistance genes in L. plantarum strains remains to be confirmed. These results suggest a potential for oral lactobacilli to be used as probiotics for oral health.
TI  - Reduction of periodontal pathogens adhesion by antagonistic strains.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Periodontitis results from a shift in the subgingival microflora into a more pathogenic direction with Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans considered as periodontopathogens. In many cases, treatment procures only a temporary shift towards a less pathogenic microflora. An alternative treatment could be the deliberate colonization of pockets with antagonistic microorganisms to control the adhesion of periodontopathogens. The aim of this study was to identify bacterial strains that reduce adhesion of periodontopathogens to surfaces. METHODS: Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus crista, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Haemophilus parainfluenzae were evaluated as potential antagonists against P. gingivalis ATCC 33277, P. intermedia ATCC 49046, and A. actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 43718 as periodontopathogens. Adhesion of periodontopathogens to the bottom plate of a parallel plate flow chamber was studied in the absence (control) and the presence of pre-adhering antagonistic strains up to a surface coverage of 5%. RESULTS: The largest reduction caused by antagonistic strains was observed for P. gingivalis. All antagonistic strains except S. crista ATCC 49999 inhibited the adhesion of P. gingivalis by at least 1.6 cells per adhering antagonist, with the largest significant reduction observed for A. naeslundii ATCC 51655 (3.8 cells per adhering antagonist). Adhering antagonists had a minimal effect on the adhesion of A. actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 43718. Intermediate but significant reductions were perceived for P. intermedia, most notably caused by S. mitis BMS. CONCLUSION: The adhesion of P. gingivalis was inhibited best by antagonistic strains, while S. mitis BMS appeared to be the most successful antagonist.
TI  - Streptococcus salivarius promotes mucin putrefaction and malodor production by Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Although the contribution of the oral microbiota to oral malodor is well-documented, the potential role of Gram-positive micro-organisms is unclear. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that Gram-positive micro-organisms contribute to malodor production by deglycosylating oral glycoproteins, rendering them susceptible to subsequent proteolysis. To this end, we examined the effect of Streptococcus salivarius on Porphyromonas gingivalis-mediated putrefaction of a model glycoprotein (pig gastric mucin). Malodor was scored by two odor judges, and volatile sulfides were determined with the use of a sulfide monitor. Mucin degradation was followed by electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE. Results showed that the addition of S. salivarius or beta-galactosidase promoted mucin degradation and concomitant malodor production. Addition of glycosidic inhibitors (p-APTG and glucose) inhibited this process. These results suggest that Gram-positive micro-organisms such as S. salivarius contribute to oral malodor production by deglycosylating salivary glycoproteins, thus exposing their protein core to further degradation by Gram-negative micro-organisms.
TI  - Oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. However, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. We aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative oral pathogens. METHODS: A total of 238 Lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. In all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis. Antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia was assessed. RESULTS: Lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. The most prevalent strains in healthy persons were Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, Lactobacillus plantarum. Obligately homofermentatives, particularly L. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for L. gasseri, P < 0.01). Sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited S. mutans, 88% A. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% P. gingivalis and 65% P. intermedia. The strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with Lactobacillus paracasei, L. plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus salivarius. The strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against S. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. CONCLUSION: The composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly L. gasseri, in the latter group. Both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.
TI  - Susceptibilities of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to antibacterial peptides, {beta}-defensins and LL37, produced by human epithelial cells.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial peptides are one of the factors involved in innate immunity. The susceptibility of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to the major antimicrobial peptides produced by epithelia was investigated. METHODS: Synthetic antimicrobial peptides of human beta-defensin-1 (hBD1), hBD2, hBD3 and LL37 (CAP18) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against oral bacteria. They included Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (20 strains), Porphyromonas gingivalis (6), Prevotella intermedia (7), Fusobacterium nucleatum (7), Streptococcus mutans (5), Streptococcus sobrinus (5), Streptococcus salivarius (5), Streptococcus sanguis (4), Streptococcus mitis (2) and Lactobacillus casei (1). RESULTS: Although the four peptides had bactericidal activity against all bacteria tested, the degree of antibacterial activity was variable against the different strains and species. The antibacterial activity of hBD1 was lower than that of the other peptides. Among the bacteria tested in this study, F. nucleatum was highly susceptible to hBD3 and LL37, and S. mutans was highly susceptible to hBD3. We measured the Zeta-potential, representing the net charge of whole bacteria, to study the relationship between susceptibility to cationic peptide and the net charge of the bacteria. Although we found some correlation in A. actinomycetemcomitans strains, we did not find a definite correlation with all the bacterial species. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that beta-defensins and LL37 have versatile antibacterial activity against oral bacteria.
TI  - LuxS-based signaling affects Streptococcus mutans biofilm formation.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans is implicated as a major etiological agent in human dental caries, and one of the important virulence properties of this organism is its ability to form biofilms (dental plaque) on tooth surfaces. We examined the role of autoinducer-2 (AI-2) on S. mutans biofilm formation by constructing a GS-5 luxS-null mutant. Biofilm formation by the luxS mutant in 0.5% sucrose defined medium was found to be markedly attenuated compared to the wild type. Scanning electron microscopy also revealed that biofilms of the luxS mutant formed larger clumps in sucrose medium compared to the parental strain. Therefore, the expression of glucosyltransferase genes was examined and the gtfB and gtfC genes, but not the gtfD gene, in the luxS mutant were upregulated in the mid-log growth phase. Furthermore, we developed a novel two-compartment system to monitor AI-2 production by oral streptococci and periodontopathic bacteria. The biofilm defect of the luxS mutant was complemented by strains of S. gordonii, S. sobrinus, and S. anginosus; however, it was not complemented by S. oralis, S. salivarius, or S. sanguinis. Biofilm formation by the luxS mutant was also complemented by Porphyromonas gingivalis 381 and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4 but not by a P. gingivalis luxS mutant. These results suggest that the regulation of the glucosyltransferase genes required for sucrose-dependent biofilm formation is regulated by AI-2. Furthermore, these results provide further confirmation of previous proposals that quorum sensing via AI-2 may play a significant role in oral biofilm formation.
TI  - Coaggregation of Streptococcus salivarius with periodontopathogens: evidence for  involvement of fimbriae in the interaction with Prevotella intermedia.
AB  - Streptococcus salivarius is divided into two serological subgroups that carry either fibrils or fimbriae. Although fimbriae have been observed on up to 50% of S. salivarius strains in the human oral cavity, no function has yet been assigned to them. To determine whether S. salivarius fimbriae have a role in adhesion, we examined the ability of S. salivarius to coaggregate with selected microorganisms involved in periodontal diseases. Our results show that S. salivarius coaggregated with Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia. However, only fimbriated S. salivarius cells were able to coaggregate with P. intermedia, suggesting a specific role for these structures in the interaction. Heat treatment, sensitivity to sugars, amino acids, and EDTA, as well as protease treatment were also used to further characterize coaggregation between S. salivarius and periodontopathogens.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult Sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.
AB  - Little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. We assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult Sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. A pooled subgingival plaque sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. Whole genomic DNA probes and the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. Using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold, between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. The percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. Miswak users harbored significantly higher Streptococcus intermedius, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Veillonella parvula, Actinomyces israelii, and Capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower Selenomonas sputigena, Streptococcus salivarius, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. Probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and V. parvula than those 4-5 mm. Our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.
TI  - Correlations between bacterial levels in autologous subgingival plaque and saliva of adult Sudanese.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess levels of oral bacteria and their correlations in paired samples of saliva and subgingival plaque in a population of adult Sudanese. Whole saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples from six probing sites of one tooth in each jaw were obtained from 56 Sudanese adults (mean age 35.2+/-8.9 years). Levels of 24 oral bacteria in the autologous saliva and pooled plaque sample of each subject were assessed by DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. There were significantly ( P< or =0.01) higher percentages of subjects with > or =10(5) bacterial cells of Prevotella intermedia, Campylobacter rectus, Veillonella parvula, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus salivarius, and Leptotrichia buccalis and significantly ( P< or =0.01) lower percentages with Treponema denticola in saliva than in subgingival plaque. The detection frequencies at > or =10(6) bacterial cells were significantly higher for Selenomonas sputigena, S. anginosus, Streptococcus sanguis, and S. salivarius and significantly lower for Porphyromonas gingivalis in saliva than in subgingival plaque ( P< or =0.01). Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, S. sputigena, S. sanguis, and Streptococcus mitis demonstrated significant ( P< or =0.05) positive correlations between their levels in plaque and saliva. This study indicates that the levels of P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, S. sanguis, and S. mitis correlate significantly in saliva and subgingival plaque and that higher accuracy of detection and assessment of the levels of these bacteria in the oral cavity may be achieved by concurrent sampling of saliva and subgingival plaque.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
AB  - Bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of Psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to China with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. In this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. The cell growth of Streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of S. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. The bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on S. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); pH, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). Bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including S. mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sobrinus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Actinomyces viscosus, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, with MICs ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. Furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of S. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of pH in the broth. Thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of MoAbs against a surface protein antigen in real-time adherence in vitro and recolonization in vivo of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - A surface protein antigen (PAc) of Streptococcus mutans, particularly the A-region of the molecule, has been reported to interact with salivary components on the tooth surface. It might be a candidate antigen inducing the production of antibodies against the adherence of S. mutans to the tooth surface. We investigated the effects of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) obtained by immunization of synthetic PAc peptides that completely correspond to the amino acid sequence of part of the A-region. These MoAbs recognize several core B-cell epitopes in the sequence. Two (KH5 and SH2) of these antibodies reacted with both S. mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus, but not with Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Porphyromonas gingivalis or Lactobacillus casei. They clearly inhibited the real-time adherence of S. mutans to salivary components in a biosensor. KH5, which showed a real-time inhibition (71%), also significantly prevented the recolonization of S. mutans on the tooth surface in rats. These results suggested that the core B-cell epitope (-Y---L--Y----) recognized by KH5 was the essential sequence in the antigenic epitopes of PAc protein recognized specifically by the inhibitory antibody. Therefore, the amino acid residues were found to be important in the initial attachment of S. mutans to the tooth surface. These results provide for the mechanism of PAc molecule in the initial attachment of S. mutans on the tooth surface and more effective designs for the removal of S. mutans and S. sobrinus from the oral cavity.
TI  - The effect of oral bacteria on Candida albicans germ-tube formation.
AB  - A total of eight bacterial isolates belonging to six species, and a select group  of 12 oral Candida albicans isolates, were used to study the effect of bacteria on germ-tube formation. Briefly, each bacterial suspension (10(5-6) cells/ml) was mixed with a C. albicans suspension (10(7) cells/ml) and incubated at 37 degrees C for 90 min with bovine serum, and the percentage germ-tube-positive Candida cells was quantified using a haemocytometer, under light microscopy. In general, out of eight bacteria, Streptococcus sanguis SK21A, Streptococcus salivarius SK56, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and S. salivarius OBU3 suppressed germ-tube formation to varying degrees, with different C albicans isolates. Porphyromonas gingivalis Pg 50, Lactobacillus casei ATCC 7469 and Prevotella intermedia OBU4 elicited significant enhancement of germ-tube formation, whereas S. sanguis OBU 2 had no effect. E. coli ATCC 25922 was the only organism to show statistically significant suppression of germ-tube formation (p=0.0312). A significant increase in the germ tube production of C. albicans isolated from HIV-infected compared with HIV-free individuals was also noted. The current results tend to suggest that commensal and transient oral bacterial populations may selectively influence the differential expression of germ-tube-forming ability of C. albicans isolates.
TI  - An evaluation of the action of different root canal irrigants on facultative aerobic-anaerobic, obligate anaerobic, and microaerophilic bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to test the effect of different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, and cetrimide on the following bacterial strains: Facultative aerobes-anaerobes: Candida albicans ATCC 10231; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212; Escherichia coli ATCC 25,922; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27,853; Streptococcus mitis ATCC 9811; Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35668; Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419; and Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556. Microaerophiles: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 29522. Obligate anaerobes: Actinomyces odontolyticus ATCC 17929; Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25,586; Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277; and Prevotella melaninogenica ATCC 25845. Each irrigant was kept in contact with the bacterial species used for the experiment for 10, 20, or 30 min. Results showed that all irrigants had a bactericidal effect on both facultative aerobes-anaerobes and on microaerophilic and obligate anaerobic strains, in all concentrations and even after short periods of contact.
TI  - The effect of oral commensal bacteria on candidal adhesion to human buccal epithelial cells in vitro.
AB  - The effect of Streptococcus sanguis, S. salivarius, Escherichia coli and Porphyromonas gingivalis on the adhesion of Candida albicans and C. krusei to human buccal epithelial cells (BEC) was investigated with a modified membrane filter system. The filters (12 microns diameter pores) acted as a support for the BEC which were pre-exposed to known concentrations of bacterial suspensions (for 45 min-1 h), and then re-incubated with standardised concentrations of yeast suspensions for various periods. The BEC with adherent yeasts were then transferred on to a glass slide, gram-stained and counted by light microscopy. Three of the four bacterial species significantly suppressed adhesion of C. albicans to BEC; S. sanguis had no effect. Both S. sanguis and S. salivarius suppressed adhesion of C. krusei to BEC pre-exposed to three different bacterial concentrations, although variable results were obtained with P. gingivalis and E. coli. Significant differences in the relative adhesion of C. albicans and C. krusei to BEC were also recorded. These results indicate that the adhesion of yeasts to BEC is modulated both by the composition and the quantity of the pre-existing bacterial flora on the BEC.
TI  - The effect of oral commensal bacteria on candidal adhesion to denture acrylic surfaces. An in vitro study.
AB  - The effect of four different species of oral bacteria (Streptococci (X 2); Escherichia; Porphyromonas) on the adhesion of Candida albicans and Candida krusei to denture acrylic surfaces was studied using a previously described in vitro adhesion assay. Clear acrylic strips immersed in known concentrations of bacterial suspensions and incubated for 45 min to 1 h, at 37 degrees C, were transferred to yeast suspensions of known concentrations and incubated for a similar period, and the adherent yeasts were quantified using an image analysis system. Pre-exposure to different bacterial concentrations resulted in suppression of candidal adhesion to varying degrees. Of three selected concentrations, exposure to the highest bacterial concentration (10(6) organisms/ml) resulted in a consistent reduction in candidal adhesion, except for E. coli-C. albicans and S. salivarius-C. albicans combinations. Candidal adhesion was significantly reduced on pre-exposure to S. sanguis and P. gingivalis, but not E. coli. There were also significant differences in relative adhesion between C. albicans and C. krusei. Taken together, these results indicate that the adhesion of yeasts to acrylic strips is modulated both by the quantity and the quality of pre-existing bacterial flora on acrylic surfaces.
TI  - Cross-reactivity between human sialyl Lewis(x) oligosaccharide and common causative oral bacteria of infective endocarditis.
AB  - The expression of sialy-Lewis(x) (sLe(x); Neu5Ac alpha 2-3 Gal beta 1-4) (Fuc alpha 1-3) GlcNAc-R) on oral bacteria producing infective endocarditis was determined by a whole-cell enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and an immunoelectron microscopy using the well-characterized anti-sLe(x) monoclonal antibody SNH-3 (mAb SNH-3; IgM class). mAb SNH-3 reacted strongly with whole cells of oral bacteria: Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens and Porphyromonas gingivalis. The negatively stained immuno-electron micrograph of Streptococcus pyogenes showed many reactive gold particles on the cell surface. Our findings demonstrated the existence of immunologic mimicry between the sLe(x) oligosaccharide and cell surface antigens of many species associated with infective endocarditis. We propose the hypothesis that if these bacteria escape their normal habitats, the surface components that mimic the sLe(x) oligosaccharide might bind to host antigens of the selectin family which could promote binding to endothelial cells and, consequently, initiation of the events leading to infective endocarditis.
TI  - Delmopinol interactions with cell walls of gram-negative and gram-positive oral bacteria.
AB  - The main purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence of delmopinol hydrochloride on the cell surface morphology of gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial cells by using transmission electron microscopy. A second purpose was to evaluate the extraction of cell wall material caused by delmopinol and the binding of radiolabelled delmopinol to the various strains. Fresh isolates and type strains of gram-negative rods associated with periodontal disease, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and strains of the gram-positive streptococci Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus salivarius, were exposed to 3.2 mM (0.1%) or 6.4 mM (0.2%) delmopinol hydrochloride from 1 to 90 min. For electron microscopy the cells were fixed and negatively contrast-stained. Treatment with 6.4 mM delmopinol for 1 min resulted in marked ultrastructural changes of cell wall components and the outer cell membrane of the 3 gram-negative species compared with control cells, whereas the gram-positive streptococci treated with delmopinol showed little or no morphologic alteration as compared with untreated cells. The result from the electron microscopy was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins released from bacterial cells treated as for electron microscopy. More material was extracted from the gram-negative rods than from the gram-positive cocci. Significantly more delmopinol bound to the gram-negative rods than to the streptococci. It appears that the amphiphilic properties of delmopinol make gram-negative rods more vulnerable to delmopinol than gram-positive streptococci.
