TI  == identification and antimicrobial activity detection of lactic acid bacteria isolated from corn stover silage.
AB  == a total of 59 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains were isolated from corn stover silage. according to phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) sequences and reca gene polymerase chain reaction amplification, these lab isolates were identified as five species: lactobacillus (l.) plantarum subsp. plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, enterococcus mundtii, weissella cibaria and leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, respectively. those strains were also screened for antimicrobial activity using a dual-culture agar plate assay. based on excluding the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide, two l. plantarum subsp. plantarum strains zzu 203 and 204, which strongly inhibited salmonella enterica atcc 43971(t), micrococcus luteus atcc 4698(t) and escherichia coli atcc 11775(t) were selected for further research on sensitivity of the antimicrobial substance to heat, ph and protease. cell-free culture supernatants of the two strains exhibited strong heat stability (60 min at 100 degrees c), but the antimicrobial activity was eliminated after treatment at 121 degrees c for 15 min. the antimicrobial substance remained active under acidic condition (ph 2.0 to 6.0), but became inactive under neutral and alkaline condition (ph 7.0 to 9.0). in addition, the antimicrobial activities of these two strains decreased remarkably after digestion by protease k. these results preliminarily suggest that the desirable antimicrobial activity of strains zzu 203 and 204 is the result of the production of a bacteriocin-like substance, and these two strains with antimicrobial activity could be used as silage additives to inhibit proliferation of unwanted microorganism during ensiling and preserve nutrients of silage. the nature of the antimicrobial substances is being investigated in our laboratory.

TI  == safety evaluation of multiple strains of lactobacillus plantarum and pediococcus  pentosaceus in wistar rats based on the ames test and a 28-day feeding study.
AB  == three lactic acid bacterial strains, lactobacillus plantarum, hk006, and hk109, and pediococcus pentosaceus pp31 exhibit probiotic potential as antiallergy agents, both in vitro and in vivo. however, the safety of these new strains requires evaluation when isolated from infant faeces or pickled cabbage. multiple strains (hk006, hk109, and pp31) were subject to a bacterial reverse mutation assay and a short-term oral toxicity study. the powder product exhibited mutagenic potential in salmonella typhimurium strains ta98 and ta1535 (with or without metabolic activation). in the short-term oral toxicity study, rats received a normal dosage of 390 mg/kg/d (approximately 9 x 10(9) cfu/kg/d) or a high dosage of 1950 mg/kg/d (approximately 4.5 x 10(10) cfu/kg/d) for 28 d. no adverse effects were observed regarding the general condition, behaviour, growth, feed and water consumption, haematology, clinical chemistry indices, organ weights, or histopathologic analysis of the rats. these studies have demonstrated that the consumption of multiple bacterial strains is not associated with any signs of mutagenicity of s. typhimurium or toxicity in wistar rats, even after consuming large quantities of bacteria.

TI  == reduction of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 infection in experimentally challenged weaned pigs fed a lactobacillus-fermented feed.
AB  == salmonella typhimurium is a foodborne pathogen and commonly present on pig farms. probiotics have shown potential as a means of reducing salmonella shedding in pigs. three experimental challenge trials were conducted to investigate the potential application of newly isolated lactobacillus isolates for controlling salmonella infection in pigs. in each trial, 16 yorkshire piglets (28-d old) were randomly allocated to 1 of 4 dietary treatments: (1) basal diet (bd), (2) naturally fermented (nf) feed, (3) lactobacillus zeae-fermented (lz-f) feed, and  4) lactobacillus casei-fermented (lc-f) feed. all pigs consumed their assigned diets for 3 d prior to the challenge of salmonella typhimurium dt104 (approximately 6 log colony-forming units/pig) through gavage. pediococcus pentosaceus, l. zeae, and l. casei were most abundant in nf, lz-f, and lc-f feed, respectively. after the challenge, pigs on fermented feed had lower rectal temperature, diarrhea scores, serum haptoglobin concentrations, and intestinal salmonella counts than the control group (bd) (p </= 0.01). salmonella spp. were  detected in both ileocecal lymph nodes (icln) and spleens from all pigs on bd, nf, and lc-f, but only 50% of spleens from pigs on lz-f. pigs had a dynamic spatial and temporal immune response to salmonella infection and dietary treatments, as indicated by up- and downregulation in gene expression of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (il)-1beta, il-6, il-10, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor) in the ileum, icln, and spleen. the alternation in cytokine expression by fermented feed, particularly lz-f, appeared to benefit pigs in combating salmonella infection.

TI  == assessment of the effects of nurmi-type cultures and a defined probiotic preparation on a salmonella typhimurium 29e challenge in vivo.
AB  == the effects of treatment with an undefined commercial nurmi-type culture (ntc), cultured cecal contents, and a dual-strain probiotic, containing enterococcus faecalis and pediococcus pentosaceus, on salmonella typhimurium colonization were evaluated in a specific-pathogen-free bird model. two sets of trials were performed, and each study was arranged as a randomized complete block design with three treatments. treatments consisted of (i) control, (ii) commercial ntc, and (iii) cultured cecal contents in the first set of trials and (i) control, (ii) defined probiotic, and (iii) cultured cecal contents in the second set. on day 1, birds were administered 1.2 x 10(7) cfu of the appropriate treatment by oral gavage. on day 3, all birds were challenged with 1 x 10(6) cfu of salmonella typhimurium 29e (nalidixic acid resistant). chicks were asphyxiated with argon gas on day 10, and ceca were aseptically removed. salmonella typhimurium counts (cfu per milliliter of cecal contents) were determined on brilliant green agar containing 30 mg of nalidixic acid per liter, and cfu counts were log transformed prior to analysis. cecal ph and volatile fatty acid concentrations were also determined. data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, and means were compared by tukey's pairwise analysis. commercial ntc and cultured cecal contents treatments resulted in a significant decrease (p < or = 0.05) in salmonella typhimurium 29e colonization, with the ntc offering a higher level of protection. in the second set of trials, the defined probiotic tended to reduce colonization  by salmonella typhimurium (p = 0.07), while chicks treated with cultured cecal contents displayed a significant decrease (p = 0.03) when compared to the negative control. no significant change was observed in cecal ph or in acetate and propionate concentrations; however, a significant increase in butyrate concentrations in both the cultured cecal contents and defined probiotic treatment groups was observed when compared to the control birds. these observations suggest that defined cultures are less effective salmonella control  agents than are preparations generated from the complete cecal microflora.

TI  == the effect of temperature on the growth and persistence of salmonella in fermented liquid pig feed.
AB  == two studies were conducted to investigate the effect of temperature on the fate of salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium dt104:30 in fermented  liquid pig feed. these were (1) by co-inoculation of feed with s. typhimurium dt104:30 and pediococcus pentosaceus, as the fermenting organism, and (2) by fermenting feed for 48, 72 or 96 h prior to inoculation with s. typhimurium dt104:30. in co-inoculated feed incubated at 20 degrees c, s. typhimurium dt104:30 persisted for at least 72 h. in contrast, in feed incubated at 30 degrees c, no s. typhimurium dt104:30 were detectable 48 h after inoculation. in  prefermented feed, s. typhimurium dt104:30 died four to five times faster in feed maintained at 30 degrees c (d(value) 34-45 min) compared with feed maintained at  20 degrees c (d(value) 137-250 min). this was not entirely due to differences in  lactic acid concentration as feed fermented for 72 or 96 h at 20 degrees c and feed fermented for 48 h at 30 degrees c contained similar concentrations of lactic acid (160-170 mm). low numbers of s. typhimurium dt104:30 were still detectable in fermented feed 24 h after inoculation at 20 degrees c. in contrast, none were detectable 6-7 h after inoculation at 30 degrees c. the results of these studies indicate that it would be advisable for pig producers to control the temperature of liquid feed tanks to reduce the risk of salmonella contamination.
