TI  == detection of periodontal pathogens in newborns and children with mixed dentition.
AB  == we report the age-related prevalence of red complex periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, along with four strains of orange complex pathogens. the bacteria present in samples isolated from tongue, cheek, and subgingival sulcus in edentulous newborns and children with mixed dentition were monitored by polymerase chain reaction (pcr).  p. gingivalis was not detected in any site of any subject in the two groups tested. however, t. denticola was not only found in the 6-13 years age group, but also in edentulous newborns at a relatively high prevalence, indicating non-dentition-related colonization by t. denticola. campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, eikenella corrodens, and parvimonas micra were found in the oral cavity of most subjects belonging to the 6-13 years age group compared to newborns. this suggested a pronounced association between these colonizing bacteria and the presence of teeth. there was also a strong relation between t. denticola and t. forsythia for their prevalence in the subgingival sulcus of the 6-13 years age group (p < 0.0001), but not in the other sites tested, suggesting that the colonization of dentition-related t. forsythia may be associated with the increased prevalence of non-dentition-related t. denticola in the subgingival sulcus. overall, these results suggest that dentition is a key determinant of bacterial colonization, especially orange complex bacteria and the red complex bacterium t. forsythia.

TI  == detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria in pregnant women by traditional anaerobic culture method and by a commercial molecular genetic method.
AB  == to culture facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria is a well-established method for analyzing subgingival plaque samples. micro-ident and micro-ident plus (hain  lifescience gmbh, nehren, germany) tests are two commercially available rapid pcr-based methods for the identification and quantification of putative periodontopathogen bacteria. in this study, we compared these commercial pcr-based hybridization methods with conventional anaerobic culture technique. a  total of 36 subgingival plaque samples were collected from periodontal pockets of pregnant women with chronic localized periodontitis. aliquots of these samples were evaluated with species-specific probes provided by micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests simultaneously, and from the same samples anaerobic and capnophylic bacteria were cultured on selective media. the overall agreement between both methods was excellent for eubacterium nodatum, tannerella forsythia  and porphyromonas gingivalis (97-92%), fair for capnocytophaga sp, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia (91-89%) and poor for fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra (micromonas micros), and campylobacter rectus (86-78%). discrepancies in the results may be explained by inability of culture method to distinguish between closely related taxa (e.i p. intermedia/prevotella. nigrescens), and problems of keeping periodontopathogen bacteria viable, which is required for successful detection by standard culture method. nucleic acid-based methods may replace cultivation method as frequently used methods in microbiological diagnosis of progressive periodontitis, thus micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests can be recommended where culture of periodontopathogenic bacteria is not performed in routine microbiology laboratories to analyze subgingival plaque samples.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.
