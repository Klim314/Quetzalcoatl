TI  - Albomycin is an effective antibiotic, as exemplified with Yersinia enterocolitica and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Albomycin belongs to the class of sideromycins, compounds composed of iron carriers linked to antibiotic moieties. Albomycin was found to be active against bacteria that have a functional ferric hydroxamate transport system meaning that bacteria will actively transport albomycin until they die. We examined the activity spectrum of albomycin for bacterial pathogens and found that Enterobacteriaceae except species of Proteus and Morganella were sensitive. Resistance in the two genera was due to the lack of the ferric hydroxamate transport system. Among Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae were highly sensitive, whereas Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were resistant. The in vivo efficacy of albomycin was examined in mice infected with S. pneumoniae or Yersinia enterocolitica. A single dose of 10mg albomycin/kg body weight reduced the colony-forming units of Y. enterocolitica by three to four orders of magnitude. A single dose of 1mg albomycin/kg body weight was sufficient to clear S. pneumoniae infections in mice. In direct competition experiments with wild-type S. pneumoniae and its albomycin-resistant mutant, the recovery rate of the mutant was lower than for the wild-type indicating that the mutant had reduced fitness in the mouse model. We conclude that albomycin is effective in clearing infections caused by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in a mouse model. Albomycin treatment reduces the bacterial load allowing the immune system to remove residual albomycin-resistant bacteria, and as such would make albomycin-based antibiotics an adjunct to treatment. The ferrichrome transport system serves as a Trojan horse to get albomycin into bacteria.
TI  - Measurement of antibacterial activities of T-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin  A, aflatoxin B1 and fumonisin B1 using microtitration tray-based turbidimetric techniques.
AB  - Various mycotoxins were tested for their antibacterial activity by evaluating growth delays using a fully automated microturbidmetric method. Ten different strains of the genera Escherichia, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Yersinia, Salmonella, Erysipelothrix and Lactobacillus were used as test micro-organisms. T-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol (DON), ochratoxin A (OTA), aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and fumonisin B1 (FB1) were used as representative mycotoxins. The inhibitory effect in vitro was defined as the difference between the growth rate without mycotoxins and the growth rate in the presence of a mycotoxin. Among the tested strains, Streptococcus agalactiae was found to be sensitive to all the toxins, with the exception of OTA. T-2 toxin and FB1 were the most effective in slowing down the growth of Staphylococcus aureus. AFB1 affected the growth of Yersinia enterocolitica. The growth rate of Escherichia coli and Salmonella infantis was decreased by FB1. Among the bacterial strains used in this study, only the growth of Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae was inhibited by OTA. Thus, using appropriate tester strains it should be possible to set up a broad-range microtubidimetry assay for individual mycotoxin screening in vitro. We concluded that the microtitration technique provides a rapid, convenient and high-throughput capacity system to analyse bacteria-mycotoxin interactions.
TI  - Effects of tamoxifen, melatonin, coenzyme Q10, and L-carnitine supplementation on bacterial growth in the presence of mycotoxins.
AB  - The involvement of toxic oxygen intermediates in the bacteriostatic effects of mycotoxins (T-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin A, aflatoxin B1, and fumonisin B1) was investigated by producing bacterial growth curves using turbidimetry assays in the presence and absence of oxygen radical-scavenging substances. The strains used in this study included Escherichia coli (FT 101), Streptococcus agalactiae (FT 311, FT 313, FT 315), Staphylococcus aureus (FT 192), Yersinia enterocolitica (FT 430), Salmonella infantis (FT 431), Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (FT 432), Lactobacillus plantarum (FT234) and Lactobacillus casei (FT 232). Tamoxifen, melatonin, l-carnitine and coenzyme Q10 were used as radical scavengers against oxygen toxicity to the strains studied. Tamoxifen was the most effective in inhibiting bacterial growth when used at a high concentration, whereas melatonin and l-carnitine were less effective. A combination of l-carnitine and coenzyme Q10 provided better protection against oxygen toxicity caused by the mycotoxins growth than they did individually. It was concluded that oxygen radicals are involved in the killing of bacteria and that there is endogenous formation of toxic oxygen products by mycotoxins. The objective of this study was to determine whether the antioxidants were able to counteract the toxic effects of the mycotoxins. The data obtained indicate that bacterial growth can be inhibited especially by T-2 toxin, aflatoxin B1 and ochratoxin A and that this effect can be partially counteracted by antioxidants such as coenzyme Q10 plus l-carnitine.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
AB  - An agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. Among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. Enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Haemophilus influenzae with an MIC90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, and Legionella pneumophila with an MIC of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin inhibited Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Norfloxacin and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (MIC90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and some other Gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. The results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against Gram-negative and Gram-positive species.
TI  - Pyomyositis in patients with diabetes mellitus.
AB  - Pyomyositis is a pyogenic infection of skeletal muscle that is endemic in the tropics and is being recognized with increasing frequency in temperate climates. We report two cases of nonendemic pyomyositis in patients with diabetes mellitus. A review of the literature suggests that diabetes mellitus may be an important risk factor for the development of pyomyositis. Possible mechanisms of this association are discussed.
TI  - Mothers of infants with neonatal group B streptococcal septicemia are poor responders to bacterial carbohydrate antigens.
AB  - Serum antibodies against various carbohydrate antigens were studied in 16 mothers of infants with serious infections caused by group B streptococci (GBS) (the study group), and compared with a control group of 29 urogenital carriers of GBS who gave birth to neonatally healthy infants. Using a radioimmunoassay for the determination of antibodies to GBS types Ia, Ib, II and III, it was found that the study group had significantly lower levels of IgG antibodies to each of the 4 GBS types than the control group. The IgG levels against Salmonella BO and DO, Yersinia enterocolitica 03, Francisella tularense and Streptococcus pneumonia types 3, 6, 9, 19 and 23 purified carbohydrate antigens were determined using an ELISA technique. Significantly more individuals in the study group than in the control group had low levels of IgG antibodies against 8 of 9 carbohydrate antigens. No difference was found in IgM levels against 3 of 4 antigens studied, while the study group showed significantly more IgM antibodies against Salmonella DO than the controls. These results indicate that mothers of GBS-infected infants might be poor IgG antibody responders to bacterial carbohydrate antigens in general.
