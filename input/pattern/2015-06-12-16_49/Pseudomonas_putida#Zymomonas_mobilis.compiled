TI  - Robustness of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 as a host for ethanol biosynthesis.
AB  - Expansion of the burgeoning biofuels agenda involves not only the design of suitable genetic and metabolic devices but also their deployment into suitable hosts that can endure the stress brought about by the products themselves. The microorganisms that are easiest to genetically manipulate for these endeavors (e.g. Escherichia coli) are often afflicted by an undesirable sensitivity to the very product that they are engineered to synthesize. In this context, we have examined the resistance to the stress arising from ethanol synthesis and/or its addition to cultures of recombinant Pseudomonas putida, using as a benchmark the same trait in an E. coli strain. To this end, ethanologenic strains of these two species were constructed by functionally expressing pdc (pyruvate decarboxylase) and adhB (alcohol dehydrogenase) from Zymomonas mobilis. Recombinants were compared under anoxic conditions as ethanol producers, and cell survival, stress resistance, and phenotypic stability were quantified in each case. P. putida consistently outperformed E. coli in every ethanol tolerance test conducted - whether the alcohol was produced endogenously or added exogenously. These results highlight the value of this bacterium as a microbial cell factory for the production of biofuels owing to its naturally pre-evolved ability to withstand different kinds of chemical stresses.
TI  - Engineering an anaerobic metabolic regime in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 for the anoxic biodegradation of 1,3-dichloroprop-1-ene.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida KT2440, a microbial cell factory of reference for industrial whole-cell biocatalysis, is unable to support biochemical reactions that occur under anoxic conditions, limiting its utility for a large number of relevant biotransformations. Unlike (facultative) anaerobes, P. putida resorts to NADH oxidation via an oxic respiratory chain and completely lacks a true fermentation metabolism. Therefore, it cannot achieve the correct balances of energy and redox couples (i.e., ATP/ADP and NADH/NAD(+)) that are required to sustain an O(2)-free lifestyle. To overcome this state of affairs, the acetate kinase (ackA) gene of the facultative anaerobe Escherichia coli and the pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase II (adhB) genes of the aerotolerant Zymomonas mobilis were knocked-in to a wild-type P. putida strain. Biochemical and genetic assays showed that conditional expression of the entire enzyme set allowed the engineered bacteria to adopt an anoxic regime that maintained considerable metabolic activity. The resulting strain was exploited as a host for the heterologous expression of a 1,3-dichloroprop-1-ene degradation pathway recruited from Pseudomonas pavonaceae 170, enabling the recombinants to degrade this recalcitrant chlorinated compound anoxically. These results underscore the value of P. putida as a versatile agent for biotransformations able to function at progressively lower redox statuses.
TI  - Implantation of unmarked regulatory and metabolic modules in Gram-negative bacteria with specialised mini-transposon delivery vectors.
AB  - Engineering of robust and safe microbial cell factories requires genetic tools somewhat different from those traditionally used for laboratory-adapted microorganisms. We took advantage of the properties of broad-host-range mini-Tn5 vectors and two regulated expression systems (LacI(Q)/P(trc) and XylS/Pm), together with FRT-flanked, excisable antibiotic resistance determinants, to generate a set of vectors for the delivery of gene(s) into the chromosome of Gram-negative bacteria. This arrangement of modular elements allows the cloning and subsequent markerless insertion of expression cargoes and leaves behind an antibiotic-sensitive host upon the action of the yeast Flp recombinase. We engineered a Pseudomonas putida KT2440 Pm::gfp strain that displayed strong fluorescence upon exposure to 3-methylbenzoate, a XylS effector, and allowed us to examine the performance of the Pm promoter at the single cell level. We also reconstructed a device for sugar transport and phosphorylation in Escherichia coli independent of the native phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system by the stable implantation of genes derived from the obligate anaerobe Zymomonas mobilis. In both cases, the information carried by the implanted genes was stably inherited in the absence of any selective pressure. Deliverable expression systems such as those described here will enhance the applicability of various Gram-negative bacteria in biocatalysis and environmental bioremediation.
TI  - Cyclohexane-1,2-dione hydrolase from denitrifying Azoarcus sp. strain 22Lin, a novel member of the thiamine diphosphate enzyme family.
AB  - Alicyclic compounds with hydroxyl groups represent common structures in numerous  natural compounds, such as terpenes and steroids. Their degradation by microorganisms in the absence of dioxygen may involve a C-C bond ring cleavage to form an aliphatic intermediate that can be further oxidized. The cyclohexane-1,2-dione hydrolase (CDH) (EC 3.7.1.11) from denitrifying Azoarcus sp. strain 22Lin, grown on cyclohexane-1,2-diol as a sole electron donor and carbon source, is the first thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent enzyme characterized to date that cleaves a cyclic aliphatic compound. The degradation of cyclohexane-1,2-dione (CDO) to 6-oxohexanoate comprises the cleavage of a C-C bond adjacent to a carbonyl group, a typical feature of reactions catalyzed by ThDP-dependent enzymes. In the subsequent NAD(+)-dependent reaction, 6-oxohexanoate is oxidized to adipate. CDH has been purified to homogeneity by the criteria of gel electrophoresis (a single band at approximately 59 kDa; calculated molecular mass, 64.5 kDa); in solution, the enzyme is a homodimer ( approximately 105 kDa; gel filtration). As isolated, CDH contains 0.8 +/- 0.05 ThDP, 1.0 +/- 0.02 Mg(2+), and 1.0 +/- 0.015 flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) per monomer as a second organic cofactor, the role of which remains unclear. Strong reductants, Ti(III)-citrate, Na(+)-dithionite, and the photochemical 5-deazaflavin/oxalate system, led to a partial reduction of the FAD chromophore. The cleavage product of CDO, 6-oxohexanoate, was also a substrate; the corresponding cyclic 1,3- and 1,4-diones did not react with CDH, nor did the cis- and trans-cyclohexane diols. The enzymes acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, pyruvate oxidase (POX) from Lactobacillus plantarum, benzoylformate decarboxylase from Pseudomonas putida, and pyruvate decarboxylase from Zymomonas mobilis were identified as the closest relatives of CDH by comparative amino acid sequence analysis, and a ThDP binding motif and a 2-fold Rossmann fold for FAD binding could be localized at the C-terminal end and central region of CDH, respectively. A first mechanism for the ring cleavage of CDO is presented, and it is suggested that the FAD cofactor in CDH is an evolutionary relict.
TI  - Analysis of the respiratory chain in Ethanologenic Zymomonas mobilis with a cyanide-resistant bd-type ubiquinol oxidase as the only terminal oxidase and its possible physiological roles.
AB  - The respiratory chain of the ethanologenic bacterium Zymomonas mobilis was investigated, in which the pyruvate-to-ethanol pathway has been demonstrated to be mainly responsible for NADH oxidation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle is incomplete. Membranes from cells cultivated under aerobic or anaerobic growth conditions showed dehydrogenase and oxidase activities for NADH, D-lactate and D-glucose and ubiquinol oxidase activity. Intriguingly, the NADH oxidase activity level of membrane fractions from cells grown aerobically was found to be higher than that of membrane fractions from Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas putida grown aerobically, indicating a crucial role of the respiratory chain in NADH oxidation in the organism. Cyanide-resistant terminal oxidase activity was observed and appeared to be due to a bd-type ubiquinol oxidase as the only terminal oxidase encoded by the entire genome. The terminal oxidase with a relatively strong ubiquinol oxidase activity exhibited remarkably weak signals of cytochrome d. Considering these findings and the presence of a type-II NADH dehydrogenase but not a type-I, a simple respiratory chain that generates less energymay have evolved in Z. mobilis.
TI  - Exchanging the substrate specificities of pyruvate decarboxylase from Zymomonas mobilis and benzoylformate decarboxylase from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Pyruvate decarboxylase from Zymomonas mobilis (PDC) and benzoylformate decarboxylase from Pseudomonas putida (BFD) are thiamine diphosphate-dependent enzymes that decarboxylate 2-keto acids. Although they share a common homotetrameric structure they have relatively low sequence similarity and different substrate spectra. PDC prefers short aliphatic substrates whereas BFD favours aromatic 2-keto acids. These preferences are also reflected in their carboligation reactions. PDC catalyses the conversion of benzaldehyde and acetaldehyde to (R)-phenylacetylcarbinol and predominantly (S)-acetoin, whereas (R)-benzoin and mainly (S)-2-hydroxypropiophenone are the products of BFD catalysis. Comparison of the X-ray structures of both enzymes identified two residues in each that were likely to be involved in determining substrate specificity. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to interchange these residues in both BFD and PDC. The substrate range and kinetic parameters for the decarboxylation reaction were studied for each variant. The most successful variants, PDCI472A and BFDA460I, catalysed the decarboxylation of benzoylformate and pyruvate, respectively, although both variants now preferred the long-chain aliphatic substrates, 2-ketopentanoic and 2-ketohexanoic acid. With respect to the carboligase activity, PDCI472A proved to be a real chimera between PDC and BFD whereas BFDA460I/F464I provided the most interesting result with an almost complete reversal of the stereochemistry of its 2-hydroxypropiophenone product.
TI  - Intermediates and transition states in thiamin diphosphate-dependent decarboxylases. A kinetic and NMR study on wild-type indolepyruvate decarboxylase and variants using indolepyruvate, benzoylformate, and pyruvate as substrates.
AB  - The thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent enzyme indolepyruvate decarboxylase (IPDC) is involved in the biosynthetic pathway of the phytohormone 3-indoleacetic acid and catalyzes the nonoxidative decarboxylation of 3-indolepyruvate to 3-indoleacetaldehyde and carbon dioxide. The steady-state distribution of covalent ThDP intermediates of IPDC reacting with 3-indolepyruvate and the alternative substrates benzoylformate and pyruvate has been analyzed by (1)H NMR spectroscopy. For the first time, we are able to isolate and directly assign covalent intermediates of ThDP with aromatic substrates. The intermediate analysis of IPDC variants is used to infer the involvement of active site side chains and functional groups of the cofactor in distinct catalytic steps during turnover of the different substrates. As a result, three residues (glutamate 468, aspartate 29, and histidine 115) positioned perpendicular to the thiazolium moiety of ThDP are involved in binding of all substrates and decarboxylation of the respective tetrahedral ThDP-substrate adducts. Most likely, interactions of these side chains with the substrate-derived carboxylate account for an optimal orientation of the substrate and/or intermediate in the course of carbon-carbon ligation and decarboxylation supporting the suggested least-motion, maximum overlap mechanism. The active site residue glutamine 383, which is located at the opposite site of the thiazolium nucleus as the "carboxylate pocket" (formed by the Glu-Asp-His triad), is central to the substrate specificity of IPDC, probably through orbital alignment. The Glu51-cofactor proton shuttle is, conjointly with the Glu-Asp-His triad, involved in multiple proton transfer steps, including ylide generation, substrate binding, and product release. Studies with para-substituted benzoylformate substrates demonstrate that the electronic properties of the substrate affect the stabilization or destabilization of the carbanion intermediate or carbanion-like transition state and in that way alter the rate dependence on decarboxylation. In conclusion, general mechanistic principles of catalysis of ThDP-dependent enzymes are discussed.
TI  - The cis-diol dehydrogenase cbaC gene of Tn5271 is required for growth on 3-chlorobenzoate but not 3,4-dichlorobenzoate.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of cbaC, the 1-carboxy-3-chloro-4,5-dihydroxycyclohexa-2,6-diene (cis-diol) dehydrogenase gene from the 3-chlorobenzoate (3-Cba) catabolic transposon Tn5271 was determined. The functional significance of the deduced open reading frame was evaluated by deletion of an internal BstEII restriction site in cbaC and by the creation of nested deletions using exonuclease III. Expression studies were carried out with Alcaligenes sp. strain BR6024, a chloramphenicol-resistant, tryptophan auxotroph derived from the wild-type isolate BR60. BR6024 hosts carrying complete cbaAB (3-Cba 3,4-(4,5)-dioxygenase and reductase) genes, with deletions of cbaC, metabolized 3Cba to the cis-4,5-diol metabolite. These mutants failed to grow on 3-Cba; however, they grew on 3,4-dichlorobenzoate, accumulating 5-chloroprotocatechuate transiently. These results indicated the cbaC dehydrogenase was not required for re-aromatization of the unstable 3,4-dCba cis-4,5-diol metabolite. Spontaneous elimination of HCl from this metabolite is proposed to generate 5-chloroprotocatechuate, which is a substrate for the protocatechuate metaring fission pathway in Alcaligenes sp. BR60. The relationship of the deduced amino acid sequence of cbaC with 15 other oxidoreductases and sequences of unknown function from bacteria, plants and animals revealed a conserved N-terminal GxxGxG dinucleotide-binding domain and a conserved region with a H(x11)KHVLxEKPxA consensus flanked by alpha-helical domains. o-Phthalate cis-diol dehydrogenase (Pseudomonas putida), glucose-fructose oxidoreductase (Zymomonas mobilis), myo-inositol-2-dehydrogenase (Bacillus subtilis) and D-galactose-1-dehydrogenase (Pseudomonas fluorescens) are related proteins. These dehydrogenases are unrelated to the Type I, II and III dehydrogenase superfamilies that include the cis-diol dehydrogenases involved in benzoate, toluene, biphenyl and naphthalene catabolism (Type II) and benzene catabolism (Type III).
TI  - Nicotinoprotein alcohol/aldehyde oxidoreductases. Enzymes with bound NAD(P) as cofactor.

TI  - Molecular characterization of microbial alcohol dehydrogenases.
AB  - There is an astonishing array of microbial alcohol oxidoreductases. They display  a wide variety of substrate specificities and they fulfill several vital but quite different physiological functions. Some of these enzymes are involved in the production of alcoholic beverages and of industrial solvents, others are important in the production of vinegar, and still others participate in the degradation of naturally occurring and xenobiotic aromatic compounds as well as in the growth of bacteria and yeasts on methanol. They can be divided into three major categories. (1) The NAD- or NADP-dependent dehydrogenases. These can in turn be divided into the group I long-chain (approximately 350 amino acid residues) zinc-dependent enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenases I, II, and III of Saccharomyces cerevisiae or the plasmid-encoded benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase of Pseudomonas putida; the group II short-chain (approximately 250 residues) zinc-independent enzymes such as ribitol dehydrogenase of Klebsiella aerogenes; the group III "iron-activated" enzymes that generally contain approximately 385 amino acid residues, such as alcohol dehydrogenase II of Zymomonas mobilis and alcohol dehydrogenase IV of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but may contain almost 900 residues in the case of the multifunctional alcohol dehydrogenases of Escherichia coli and Clostridium acetobutylicum. The aldehyde/alcohol oxidoreductase of Amycolatopsis methanolica and the methanol dehydrogenases of A. methanolica and Mycobacterium gasti are 4-nitroso-N,N-dimethylaniline-dependent nicotinoproteins. (2) NAD(P)-independent enzymes that use pyrroloquinoline quinone, haem or cofactor F420 as cofactor, exemplified by methanol dehydrogenase of Paracoccus denitrificans, ethanol dehydrogenase of Acetobacter and Gluconobacter spp. and the alcohol dehydrogenases of certain archaebacteria. (3) Oxidases that catalyze an essentially irreversible oxidation of alcohols, such as methanol oxidase of Hansenula polymorpha and probably the veratryl alcohol oxidases of certain fungi involved in lignin degradation. This review deals mainly with those enzymes for which complete amino acid sequences are available. The discussion focuses on a comparison of their primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures and their catalytic mechanisms. The physiological roles of the enzymes and isoenzymes are also considered, as are their probable evolutionary relationships.
TI  - Molecular analysis of the Erwinia chrysanthemi region containing the kdgA and zwf genes.
AB  - The pathways of pectin and galacturonate catabolism in Erwinia chrysanthemi converge to form a common intermediate, 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate, which is phosphorylated to form 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDGP) and then cleaved by the aldolase encoded by the kdgA gene. We cloned the kdgA gene of the E. chrysanthemi strain 3937 by complementing an Escherichia coli kdgA mutation, using an RP4-derivative plasmid. Restriction mapping of the kdgA region and isolation of kdgA-lac fusions allowed the more precise localization of the kdgA gene and determination of its transcriptional direction. The nucleotide sequence of the kdgA region indicated that the kdgA reading frame is 639 bases long, corresponding to a protein of 213 amino acids with a molecular mass of 22,187 Da. Comparison of the deduced primary amino acid sequences of the E. chrysanthemi KDGP-aldolase to the E. coli, Zymomonas mobilis and Pseudomonas putida enzymes showed that they are highly conserved. The E. chrysanthemi kdgA structural gene begins 153 bases downstream of an open reading frame that has a high homology with the zwf E. coli gene encoding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The zwf gene is also linked to eda (kdgA) in E. coli and P. putida but genetic organization is different. Regulation of zwf and kdgA expression in E. chrysanthemi was analysed using lacZ fusions. The expression of zwf is independent of the growth rate, but is repressed in the presence of glucose. Induction of kdgA by pectin-degradation products is mediated in vivo by the negative regulatory gene kdgR, which also controls all the steps of pectin degradation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Molecular characterization of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway in Escherichia coli: sequence analysis and localization of promoters for the edd-eda operon.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the entire Escherichia coli edd-eda region that encodes the enzymes of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway was determined. The edd structural gene begins 236 bases downstream of zwf. The eda structural gene begins 34 bases downstream of edd. The edd reading frame is 1,809 bases long and encodes the 602-amino-acid, 64,446-Da protein 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase. The deduced primary amino acid sequences of the E. coli and Zymomonas mobilis dehydratase enzymes are highly conserved. The eda reading frame is 642 bases long and encodes the 213-amino-acid, 22,283-Da protein 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase. This enzyme had been previously purified and sequenced by others on the basis of its related enzyme activity, 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase. The data presented here provide proof that the two enzymes are identical. The primary amino acid sequences of the E. coli, Z. mobilis, and Pseudomonas putida aldolase enzymes are highly conserved. When E. coli is grown on gluconate, the edd and eda genes are cotranscribed. Four putative promoters within the edd-eda region were identified by transcript mapping and computer analysis. P1, located upstream of edd, appears to be the primary gluconate-responsive promoter of the edd-eda operon, responsible for induction of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway, as mediated by the gntR product. High basal expression of eda is explained by constitutive transcription from P2, P3, and/or P4 but not P1.
TI  - Transposable elements for efficient manipulation of a wide range of gram-negative bacteria: promoter probes and vectors for foreign genes.
AB  - We describe here the construction and use of a series of modified transposons based on the insertion sequence IS1. Like their parent, omegon-Km [Fellay et al., Gene 76 (1989) 215-226], these elements permit efficient insertional mutagenesis of a variety of Gram-negative bacteria. The presence of a functional pBR322 origin of replication within the transposable element facilitates subsequent cloning of the mutated gene. The omegon-Km system was previously shown to function in Pseudomonas putida, Rhizobium leguminosarum and Paracoccus denitrificans. The results we present here demonstrate that its use can be extended to Xanthomonas campestris, a plant pathogen, and to the microaeroduric Zymomonas mobilis. Derivative transposons carrying unique restriction sites for ScaI, NdeI, XbaI and XhoI have been constructed, allowing the cloning and introduction of foreign genes. We have also constructed two derivatives which can be used to generate operon fusions upon insertion and are thus useful for isolating and characterising indigenous promoters. One carries a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase (CAT)-encoding gene (cat) and the second, the entire promoterless Escherichia coli lac operon. We demonstrate the utility of the cat promoter probe in X. campestris to target conditional promoters inducible by high salt or subject to repression by glucose.
TI  - Cosmid cloning of five Zymomonas trp genes by complementation of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida trp mutants.
AB  - A library of Zymomonas mobilis genomic DNA was constructed in the broad-host-range cosmid pLAFR1. The library was mobilized into a variety of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida trp mutants by using the helper plasmid pRK2013. Five Z. mobilis trp genes were identified by the ability to complement the trp mutants. The trpF, trpB, and trpA genes were on one cosmid, while the trpD and trpC genes were on two separate cosmids. The organization of the Z. mobilis trp genes seems to be similar to the organization found in Rhizobium spp., Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Pseudomonas acidovorans. The trpF, trpB, and trpA genes appeared to be linked, but they were not closely associated with trpD or trpC genes.
TI  - Construction of a transposon containing a gene for polygalacturonate trans-eliminase from Klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  - A DNA fragment containing a Klebsiella oxytoca gene for polygalacturonate trans-eliminase was cloned into the kanamycin resistance transposon Tn5. This new transposon, designated Tn5-Pga+, had a transposition frequency of 1 X 10(-6). The broad host range plasmid pR751::Tn5-Pga+ was conjugally transferred to a variety of genetic backgrounds. The ability to degrade polygalacturonate was expressed in Aeromonas hydrophila, Alcaligenes eutrophus, Azotomonas insolita, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida and Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides, but not in Zymomonas mobilis.
