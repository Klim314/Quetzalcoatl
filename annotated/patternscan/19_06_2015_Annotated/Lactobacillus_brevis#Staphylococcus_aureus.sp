TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == characterization of indigenous lactobacillus strains for probiotic properties.
AB  == background: probiotics are defined as adequate amount of live microorganisms able to confer health benefits on the host. currently, most commercially available probiotic products in the market belong to genera lactobacillus. traditional dairy products are usually rich source of lactobacillus strains with significant  health benefits. in order to evaluate the probiotic potential of these bacteria,  it is essential to assess their health benefits, efficacy, and safety. objectives: the probiotic efficacy of two lactobacillus strains namely lactobacillus pentosus lp05 and l. brevis lb32 was evaluated. they were previously isolated from ewes' milk in a rural area in east azerbaijan, iran. materials and methods: the selected isolates were tested for certain phenotypic characters and identified to genus and species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing  and species specific primers. further analysis included acid and bile resistance, antagonistic activity, cholesterol removing ability, survival in simulated gastric and upper intestine contents, aggregation and coaggregation properties. finally, the adhering ability of the selected lactobacillus strains to epithelial cells was tested using caco-2 cell lines. results: the selected isolates tolerated bile salt concentrations ranging from 0.5% to 3%, however their coefficient of inhibition were varied. both isolates hydrolyzed bile and grew at  ph values of 3, 4, and 5, while isolate lp05 was not able to hydrolyze arginine.  based on 16s rrna gene sequencing and species-specific primers, the isolates were identified as l. brevis lb32 and l. pentosus lp05. in contrast to simulated gastric conditions, the growth rate of the isolates in alkaline conditions of upper intestine increased significantly with the passage of time reaching its maximum in 24 hours. these 2 isolates inhibited the growth of listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enteritidis, shigella dysenteriae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumonia. furthermore, l. brevis lb32 was able to reduce approximately 86% of cholesterol compared to l. pentosus lp05, which showed only 69% of reduction. higher aggregation and coaggregation percentage and adherence to caco-2 cell line was observed in l. pentosus lp05 compared to l. brevis lb32. conclusions: this research study proved the presence of viable probiotic lab microflora in the ewe milk with enhanced health benefits. the 2 selected lactobacillus strains could be exploited in dairy or pharmaceutical industry in future.

TI  == identification of lactobacilli with inhibitory effect on biofilm formation by pathogenic bacteria on stainless steel surfaces.
AB  == two hundred and thirty individual clones of microorganisms were recovered from milk tanks and milking machine surfaces at two distinct farms (bejaja city, algeria). of these clones, 130 were identified as lactic acid bacteria (lab). in  addition escherichia coli, salmonella, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa species were identified in the remaining 100 isolates-spoilage isolate. these isolates were assayed for ability to form biofilms. s. aureus, lactobacillus brevis strains lb1f2, lb14f1 and lb15f1, and lactobacillus pentosus strains lb2f2 and lb3f2 were identified as the best biofilm formers. besides, these lab isolates were able to produce proteinaceous substances with antagonism  against the aforementioned spoilage isolates, when grown in mrs or tsb-ye media.  during the screening, l. pentosus lb3f2 exhibited the highest antibacterial activity when grown in tsb-ye medium at 30 degrees c. additionally, l. pentosus lb3f2 was able to strongly hamper the adhesion of s. aureus sa3 on abiotic surfaces as polystyrene and stainless steel slides. lab isolates did not show any hemolytic activity and all of them were sensitive to different families of antibiotic tested. it should be pointed out that lb3f2 isolate was not cytotoxic  on the intestinal cells but could stimulate their metabolic activity. this report unveiled the potential of lb1f2, lb14f1, lb15f1, lb2f2, and lb3f2 isolates to be  used as natural barrier or competitive exclusion organism in the food processing  sector as well as a positive biofilm forming bacteria.

TI  == detection, partial purification and characterization of bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus brevis fptlb3 isolated from freshwater fish: bacteriocin from lb. brevis fptlb3.
AB  == lactobacillus brevis fptlb3 was isolated from freshwater fish, capable of producing bacteriocin that had broad spectrum of inhibition (3200 au/ml) against  escherichia coli mtcc 1563, enterococcus faecalis mtcc 2729, lactobacillus casei  mtcc 1423, lactobacillus sakei atcc 15521 and staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923. the antimicrobial activity of crude supernatant fluid was stable after heating at 121 degrees c for 60 min and declined thereafter. stability of antimicrobial activity was observed at ph range of 2.0 to 8.0. its active principle was proteinaceous in nature since the bacteriocin was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, but not by other non-proteolytic enzymes. mitomycin c and uv light did not affect the activity of the bacteriocin, while chloroform extraction completely destroyed their activity. exposure to surfactant resulted in an increase in titre, except nonidet p-40, which led to total loss of activity. no bacteriocin adsorption was detected at ph 1 to 2, whereas 100% bacteriocin adsorption was found at ph 6.5. based on tricine sds-page the estimated molecular mass of bacteriocin was 54 kda. no plasmid was found to present in the isolate.

TI  == strain-specific probiotics properties of lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus brevis isolates from brazilian food products.
AB  == a total of 234 lab isolates from brazilian food products were initially screened  for their ability to survive at ph 2.0. fifty one of the isolates survived and were selected. they were characterized by phenotypic methods, rep-pcr and identified using 16s rrna gene sequencing as lactobacillus fermentum (34 isolates), lactobacillus plantarum (10) and lactobacillus brevis (7). based on being either highly tolerant to bile, showing an ability for auto-aggregation and/or hydrophobic properties, one l. fermentum (ch58), three l. plantarum (ch3,  ch41 and sau96) and two l. brevis (sau105 and ffc199) were selected. the highest  co-aggregation ability with escherichia coli was observed to l. plantarum ch41. l. brevis sau105 and ffc199 and l. fermentum ch58 exhibited antagonistic activity towards the pathogens listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus. l. plantarum ch3 and ch41 and l. brevis ffc199 showed adhesion ability to caco-2 cells (1.6, 1.1 and 0.9%, respectively) similar to the commercial probiotic, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (1.5%). they were able to increase the transepithelial electrical resistance (teer) of caco-2 cells over 24 h (p < 0.05). the present work showed that the probiotic characteristics were strain-specific and that the  isolates l. plantarum ch3 and ch41 (cocoa) and l. brevis ffc199 (cauim) exhibited potential probiotics properties.

TI  == probiotic potential of lactobacillus spp. isolated from brazilian regional ovine  cheese.
AB  == twelve lactobacillus isolates from brazilian starter-free ovine cheeses were evaluated for their probiotic potential. the strains were identified by 16s rdna  sequencing as lactobacillus plantarum (7), lb. brevis (2), lb. casei (2) and lb.  parabuchneri (1). all strains showed variable resistance to gastric juices and relative tolerance to pancreatin and bile salts. only five strains of lb. plantarum could not deconjugate the sodium salt of taurodeoxycholic acid. autoaggregation ability after 24 h was above 50% and hydrophobicity was higher than 60% for most strains. all lactobacilli could inhibit linolenic acid oxidation, except lb. parabuchneri strain, whereas none of them could scavenge dpph radical. beta-galactosidase activity ranged from 47.7 to 2503 miller units.  inhibition of food pathogens listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium was demonstrated and the production of organic acids could be associated with this effect. the lactobacillus strains from brazilian regional ovine cheese showed interesting functional characteristics, mainly the strains lb. brevis sm-b and lb. plantarum  sm-i. both presented high acid tolerance. in addition, lb. brevis sm-b also displayed remarkable antioxidant activity and lb. plantarum sm-i was the highest  beta-galactosidase producer, exhibited high autoaggregation and hydrophobicity properties.

TI  == development of bacteria identification array to detect lactobacilli in thai fermented sausage.
AB  == to improve the quality and safety of food products, there is a need in the food industry for a reliable method for simultaneously monitoring multiple bacterial strains. microarray technology is a high-throughput screening approach that can provide an alternative for bacteria detection. a total of 164 bacteria-specific probes were designed from 16s rrna gene sequences to target 12 bacteria species,  including lactic acid bacteria and selected food pathogens. after fabrication onto aminosilane-coated slides, hybridization conditions of the array were optimized for high specificity and signal intensities. the array was applied to detect 12 bacteria individually and was specific to all (lactobacillus plantarum  group, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. delbrueckii, l. casei, l. sakei, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus and listeria monocytogenes) except l. animalis. multiplex detection using mixed bacteria populations was evaluated and accurate detection was obtained. the feasibility of using the array to detect the target bacteria in food was evaluated with thai fermented sausages  (nham). meat samples were collected on days 2, 3 and 7 after natural fermentation, l. plantarum-inoculated fermentation and l. brevis-inoculated fermentation before applying to the array. the naturally-fermented nham contained l. sakei, l. delbrueckii, l. plantarum and l. fermentum. the l. plantarum-inoculated nham showed a similar lactic acid bacteria population but the positive signal level for l. plantarum was higher than with natural fermentation. the l. brevis-inoculated nham contained l. brevis, l. plantarum, l. delbrueckii and l. fermentum. the array was used to monitor bacteria population dynamics during the fermentation process. the naturally-fermented and l. brevis-inoculated samples showed lower positive signal levels of l. plantarum on  day 2, but signals gradually increased on days 3 and 7 of the fermentation. in contrast, the l. plantarum-started fermentation showed a higher positive signal level on day 2 than the natural and l. brevis-inoculated samples, and the positive signal level remained high on days 3 and 7. the bacteria identification  array was proven to be useful as an alternative method to detect and monitor target bacteria populations during food fermentation.

TI  == effects of bile salt deconjugation by probiotic strains on the survival of antibiotic-resistant foodborne pathogens under simulated gastric conditions.
AB  == this study was designed to evaluate the effects of bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains on the antibiotic susceptibility of antibiotic-sensitive and multiple antibiotic-resistant salmonella typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus. eight probiotic strains, bifidobacterium longum b6, lactobacillus acidophilus adh, lactobacillus brevis kacc 10553, lactobacillus casei kacc 12413, lactobacillus paracasei atcc 25598, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, leuconostoc mesenteroides kacc 12312, and pediococcus acidilactici kacc 12307, were used to examine bile acid tolerance. the ability to deconjugate bile acids was evaluated  using both thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography.  the antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out to determine the synergistic inhibitory activity of deconjugated bile acids. l. acidophilus, l. brevis, and p. acidilactici showed the most tolerance to the conjugated bile acids. p. acidilactici deconjugated glycocholic acid and glycodeoxycholate from 3.18 and 3.09 mm to the detection limits, respectively. the antibiotic susceptibility of selected foodborne pathogens was increased by increasing the concentration of deconjugated bile acids. the study results are useful for understanding the relationship between bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains and antibiotic susceptibility in the presence of deconjugated bile acids, and they may be useful for designing new probiotic-antibiotic combination therapy based on bile acid deconjugation.

TI  == antibiosis of vineyard ecosystem fungi against food-borne microorganisms.
AB  == fermentation extracts from fungi isolated from vineyard ecosystems were tested for antimicrobial activities against a set of test microorganisms, including five food-borne pathogens (staphylococcus aureus ep167, acinetobacter baumannii (clinically isolated), pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1, escherichia coli o157:h7 (cect 5947) and candida albicans my1055) and two probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus plantarum lch17 and lactobacillus brevis lch23). a total of 182 fungi was grown in eight different media, and the fermentation extracts were screened for antimicrobial activity. a total of 71 fungi produced extracts active against at least one pathogenic microorganism, but not against any probiotic bacteria. the gram-positive bacterium s. aureus ep167 was more susceptible to antimicrobial fungi broth extracts than gram-negative bacteria and pathogenic fungi. identification of active fungi based on internal transcribed spacer rrna sequence analysis revealed that species in the orders pleosporales, hypocreales and xylariales dominated. differences in antimicrobial selectivity were observed  among isolates from the same species. some compounds present in the active extracts were tentatively identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.  antimicrobial metabolites produced by vineyard ecosystem fungi may potentially limit colonization and spoilage of food products by food-borne pathogens, with minimal effect on probiotic bacteria.

TI  == partial characterization of bacteriocins produced by two lactobacilus strains with probiotic properties.
AB  == the probiotic characteristics of lactobacillus brevis bg18 and lb. plantarum bg33, isolated from traditional turkish tulum cheese were assessed. these two bacteriocinproducer strains exhibited good probiotic characteristics such as resistance in media containing 0.3% bile salt, pepsin (3 mg ml(-)(1)), and pancreatine (1 mg ml(-)(1)) as well as acid resistance at ph 2. they were also adhered to caco-2 epithelial cells in a manner comparable to escherichia coli lmg3083 (etec) and salmonella typhimurium sl1344. the strains produced a heat-stable antimicrobial compound that was shown to be proteinaceous in nature,  and therefore, referred to as bacteriocins. the bacteriocins were able to inhibit growth of a number grampositive bacteria such as listeria monocytogenes, clostridium botulinum, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus. tricine-sds-page of the active fraction resulted in single bands with estimated molecular masses of 2.5 kda and 2.7 kda for lb. brevis bg18 and lb. plantarum bg33 bacteriocins, respectively.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of phenolic acids against commensal, probiotic and pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == phenolic acids (benzoic, phenylacetic and phenylpropionic acids) are the most abundant phenolic structures found in fecal water. as an approach towards the exploration of their action in the gut, this paper reports the antimicrobial activity of thirteen phenolic acids towards escherichia coli, lactobacillus spp., staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. the growth of e. coli atcc 25922 was inhibited by only four of the phenolic acids tested at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml, whereas pathogenic e. coli o157:h7 (cect 5947) was susceptible to ten of them. the genetically manipulated e. coli lpxc/tolc strain was highly susceptible to phenolic acids. the growth of lactobacilli (lactobacillus paraplantarum lch7, lactobacillus plantarum lch17, lactobacillus fermentum lph1, l. fermentum cect 5716, lactobacillus brevis lch23, and lactobacillus coryniformis cect 5711) and pathogens (s. aureus ep167 and c. albicans my1055) was also inhibited by phenolic acids, but to varying extents. only p. aeruginosa pao1 was not susceptible to any of the phenolic compounds tested. structure-activity relationships of phenolic acids and some of their diet precursors [(+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin] were established, based on multivariate analysis of microbial activities. the antimicrobial properties of phenolic acids reported in this paper might be relevant in vivo.

TI  == bacterial dynamics in model cheese systems, aiming at safety and quality of portuguese-style traditional ewe's cheeses.
AB  == an experiment using model ewe's milk cheeses was designed to characterize microbial interactions that arise in actual raw milk cheese environments. these model cheeses were manufactured according to portuguese artisanal practices, except that the microbial load and biodiversity were fully controlled: single potential pathogens and spoilage bacteria, or a combination thereof, were combined at various initial inoculum levels in sterilized raw ewe's milk with several lactic acid bacteria (lab) normally found in traditional cheeses. viable  microbial counts were monitored throughout a 60-day ripening period. two alternative mathematical approaches were used to fit the experimental data generated in terms of population dynamics: percent of inhibition and d-values. these were able to explain the complex competitive interactions between the contaminant microorganisms and the lab adventitious populations. in general, the  tested lab were less able to inhibit contaminants present in combination and in higher concentrations. lactococcus lactis, with its strong acidifying potential,  was the most effective factor in controlling the unwanted bacterial population, especially single staphylococcus aureus. the two lactobacilli studied, especially lactobacillus brevis, were shown to be less effective; escherichia coli and listeria innocua were the contaminants least inhibited by the lab.

TI  == assessment of cell surface properties and adhesion potential of selected probiotic strains.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the physicochemical cell surface and adhesive properties of selected probiotic strains for human use. methods and results: probiotic strains, bifidobacterium longum b6, lactobacillus acidophilus adh, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides and pediococcus acidilactici were tested for the physicochemical properties of cell surfaces and the adhesion abilities against foodborne pathogens. bif. longum b6 (53.6%) and lact. rhamnosus gg (46.5%) showed the highest hydrophobicity, while the least affinity to xylene was observed in ped. acidilactici (10.4%). bifidobacterium longum b6 showed the strongest coaggregation phenotype with listeria monocytogenes (53.0%), shigella boydii (42.0%) and staphylococcus aureus (45.9%). lactobacillus rhamnosus gg had the strong binding ability to caco-2 cells and effectively inhibited the adhesion of  l. monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, sh. boydii and staph. aureus to caco-2  cells. the hydrophobicity was highly correlated with coaggregative abilities and  competitive inhibition, suggesting a good relationship between in vitro adhesion  and in vivo colonization. conclusion: the results suggest that bif. longum b6 and lact. rhamnosus gg can be candidate probiotics available for human consumption. significance and impact of the study: because the use of probiotic strains has been more concerned with their beneficial effects in the gi tract, it is essential to examine the potential of probiotic strains based on the physicochemical properties in terms of bacterial-binding and adhesion capabilities.

TI  == inhibition of uropathogens by lactic acid bacteria isolated from dairy foods and  cow's intestine in western nigeria.
AB  == a total of 96 lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from african indigenous fermented products and cow's intestines to study their inhibitory capability against multi-drug-resistant uropathogens. escherichia coli accounted for approximately 45% of isolated uropathogens, followed by staphylococcus spp. (20%). the gram negative uropathogens were highly resistant to quinolones, co-trimoxazole, teicoplanin and some beta-lactams, while the staphylococcus spp.  showed high resistance to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams and macrolides. twenty-four lab isolates were selected based on their antimicrobial activity against two uropathogenic staphylococcus aureus strains and bacteriocin production. lab strains showing antimicrobial activity were grouped into smaller  groups through amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra). representative strains were identified as weissella spp., enterococcus faecium, lactococcus lactis and lactobacillus brevis through sequencing of 16s rdna. the weissella spp. and l. brevis strains demonstrated remarkable inhibitory activity  against seven strains of gram negative uropathogens. two strains of l. lactis produced a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance active against lactobacillus sakei. in this study, an unusual high rate of co-trimoxazole, quinolones and macrolides resistance among uropathogens from south west nigeria was discovered.  based on their sensitivity to weissella spp., there is a potential for using these lab as a natural approach for the protection against the uropathogens assayed.

TI  == functional properties of selected starter cultures for sour maize bread.
AB  == this paper focuses on the functional properties of maize sour-dough microflora selected and tested for their use as starter cultures for sour maize bread. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolated from spontaneously fermented maize dough were selected based on dominance during fermentation and presence at the end of fermentation. functional properties examined included acidification, leavening and production of some antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting matrix. the organisms previously identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. fermentum, lb. acidophilus, pediococcus acidilactici, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc dextranicum and saccharomyces cerevisiae were used singly and as  mixed cultures in the fermentation (fermentation time: 12h at 28+/-2 degrees c) of maize meal (particle size >0.2mm). the ph fell from an initial value of 5.62-3.05 in maize meals fermented with lb. plantarum; 4.37 in l. dextranicum+s.  cerevisiae compared with the value for the control (no starter) of 4.54. significant differences (p <or =0.05) were observed in values obtained for the functional properties tested when starters were inoculated compared with the control (no starter) except for leavening. bivariate correlations at 0.01 levels  (two-tailed) showed that significant correlations existed among ph and production of antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting meals, the highest correlation being between production of diacetyl and acid (0.694), a positive correlation indicating that production of both antimicrobial compounds increase together with time. antimicrobial activities of the fermented maize dough were confirmed by their abilities to inhibit the growth of salmonella typhi, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and aspergillus flavus from an initial inoculum concentration of 7 log cfu ml(-1)) for test bacteria and zone of inhibition of up to 1.33 cm for aflatoxigenic a. flavus. the findings of this study form a database for further studies on the development of starter cultures for sour maize bread production as an alternative bread specialty.

TI  == enumeration of bacterial cell numbers by amplified firefly bioluminescence without cultivation.
AB  == we recently developed a novel bioluminescent enzymatic cycling assay for atp and  amp with the concomitant use of firefly luciferase and pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (ppdk), where amp and pyrophosphate produced from atp by firefly luciferase were converted back into atp by ppdk. background luminescence derived  from contaminating atp and amp in the reagent was reduced using adenosine phosphate deaminase which degrades atp, adp, and amp, resulting in constant and highly amplified bioluminescence with low background luminescence. to detect bacterial cells without cultivation, we applied the above bioluminescent enzymatic cycling reagent to rapid microbe detection system. atp spots (0.31-5.0  amol/spot) at the level of a single bacterial cell were detected with 5 min signal integration, signifying that integrated luminescence was amplified 43 times in comparison to traditional atp bioluminescence. consequently, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and lactobacillus brevis in  beer were detected without cultivation. significant correlation was observed between the number of signal spots obtained using this novel system and the colony-forming units observed with the conventional colony-counting method (r(2)=0.973).

TI  == antibacterial activity of chitosans and chitosan oligomers with different molecular weights.
AB  == antibacterial activities of six chitosans and six chitosan oligomers with different molecular weights (mws) were examined against four gram-negative (escherichia coli, pseudomonas fluorescens, salmonella typhimurium, and vibrio parahaemolyticus) and seven gram-positive bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, bacillus megaterium, b. cereus, staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus plantarum, l. brevis, and l. bulgaricus). chitosans showed higher antibacterial activities than chitosan oligomers and markedly inhibited growth of most bacteria tested although inhibitory effects differed with mws of chitosan and the particular bacterium. chitosan generally showed stronger bactericidal effects with gram-positive bacteria than gram-negative bacteria in the presence of 0.1% chitosan. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of chitosans ranged from 0.05% to >0.1% depending on the bacteria and mws of chitosan. as a chitosan solvent, 1% acetic acid was effective in inhibiting the growth of most of the bacteria tested except for lactic acid bacteria that were more effectively suppressed with 1% lactic or formic acids. antibacterial activity of chitosan was inversely affected by ph (ph 4.5-5.9 range tested), with higher activity at lower ph value.

TI  == typing and subtyping of 83 clinical isolates purified from surgically implanted silicone feeding tubes by random amplified polymorphic dna amplification.
AB  == in this study, 83 clinical isolates purified from biofilms colonizing 18 silicone gastrostomy devices (12 "buttons" and six tubes converted to skin level devices)  were selected for subtype characterization utilizing genetic analysis. the tubes, previously used for feeding, remained in place for 3 to 47 months (mean, 20.0 months) in children ranging in age from 6 months to 17 years. classification of specific microbes using random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis revealed genetic similarities and differences among isolates belonging to the same genus.  both gram-positive and -negative bacteria were investigated, including 2 isolates of bacillus brevis, 4 isolates of bacillus licheniformis, 2 isolates of bacillus  pumilus, 3 isolates of enterococcus durans, 19 isolates of enterococcus faecalis, 8 isolates of enterococcus faecium, 2 isolates of enterococcus hirae, 7 isolates  of escherichia coli, 8 isolates of lactobacillus plantarum, 19 isolates of staphylococcus aureus, 2 isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, and 7 isolates of staphylococcus saprophyticus. amplified dna fragments (amplicons) provided species-specific fingerprints for comparison by agarose gel electrophoresis. a total of 62 distinct rapd types were categorized from the five genera studied. typing analysis suggested cross acquisition of e. coli, e. faecalis, and s. aureus in three patient pairs. genomic polymorphism detection proved efficient and reliable for classifying bacterial subtypes isolated from biofilms adhering to various portions of commonly employed enteral access tubes.

TI  == [cloning and gene expression in lactic acid bacteria].
AB  == the possibility of using the genera lactobacillus and lactococcus as vector representatives is widely discussed at present. the prospects of the construction of recombinant bacteria are closely connected with the solution of a number of problems: the level of the transcription of cloned genes, the effectiveness of the translation of heterologous mrna, the stability of protein with respect to bacterial intracellular proteases, the method by protein molecules leave the cell (by secretion or as the result of lysis). to prevent segregation instability, the construction of vector molecules on the basis of stable cryptic plasmids found in wild strains of lactic acid bacteria was proposed. high copying plasmids with low molecular weight were detected in l. plantarum and l. pentosus strains. several plasmids with molecular weights of 1.7, 1.8 and 2.3 kb were isolated from bacterial cells to be used as the basis for the construction of vector molecules. genes of chloramphenicol- and erythromycin-resistance from staphylococcus aureus  plasmids were used as marker genes ensuring cell transformation. the vector plasmids thus constructed exhibited high transformation activity in the electroporation of different strains, including l. casei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum and l. brevis which could be classified with the replicons of a wide circle of hosts. but the use of these plasmids was limited due to the risk of the uncontrolled dissemination of recombinant plasmids. l. acidophilus were also found to have strictly specific plasmids with good prospects of being used as the basis for the creation of vectors, incapable of dissemination. in addition to the search of strain-specific plasmids, incapable of uncontrolled gene transmission, the use of chromosome-integrated heterologous  genes is recommended in cloning to ensure the maximum safety.

TI  == antibacterial activity of lactobacillus species against vibrio species.
AB  == forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.

TI  == microorganism inactivation using high-pressure generation in sealed vessels under sub-zero temperature.
AB  == in order to test the possibility of utilizing high pressure in bioscience and biotechnology, a simple method for high-pressure generation and its use for microbial inactivation have been studied. when a pressure vessel was filled with  water, sealed tightly and cooled to sub-zero temperatures, high pressure was generated in the vessel. the pressure generation was 60 mpa at -5 degrees c, 103  mpa at -10 degrees c, and 140 mpa at -15 degrees c, -20 degrees c, and -22 degrees c. the high pressure generated inactivated microorganisms effectively: yeasts (saccharomyces cerevisiae and zygosaccharomyces rouxii), bacteria (lactobacillus brevis and eschericia coli), and fungi (aspergillus niger and aspergillus oryzae) were completely inactivated when stored in sealed vessels -20 degrees c for 24 h. however, staphylococcus aureus was only partly inactivated under the same conditions. this method opens up a new application of high pressure for storing, transporting, and sterilizing of foods and biological materials.

AB  == inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-p), has been documented for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus bovis, and lactococcus lactis, but not for other gram-positive bacteria. using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated atp-dependent hpr(ser) kinase that phosphorylates ser-46 in hpr of the phosphotransferase system. a small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-p phosphatase (pase  ii), previously identified only in lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, or bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. further, lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks pase ii. the results reveal that pase ii is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-p hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. they provide correlative evidence that pase ii initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of neutralized extracellular culture filtrates of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a cultured indian milk product ('dahi').
AB  == neutralized extracellular culture filtrate obtained from isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbruecki ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus salivarius and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis from 'dahi' showed weak to moderate inhibition of staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, bacillus brevis, bacillus circulans, bacillus coagulans, bacillus laterosporus, bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa when tested by the diffusion agar well assay method. the effective minimum quantity of lactic culture filtrates required to obtain complete inhibition of an inoculum of 10(3)  cfu/ml of the bacteria tested was between 20 and 26% (vol/vol), as determined by  the agar incorporation method. neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of these lactic cultures added at a level of 10% in sterile, 10% reconstituted non-fat dry milk was able to either suppress or retard growth of selected bacterial cultures when incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. this study indicated  the antimicrobial activity of dahi and the potential of using neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of lactic acid bacteria in the biopreservation of  foods.

TI  == staphylococcus aureus has clustered trna genes.
AB  == the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used to detect large trna gene clusters in bacillus subtilis, bacillus badius, bacillus megaterium, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, and staphylococcus aureus. the primers were based on conserved sequences of known gram-positive bacterial trna(arg) and trna(phe) genes. this pcr procedure detected an unusually large trna gene cluster in s. aureus. pcr-generated probes were used to identify a 4.5-kb ecori fragment that contained 27 trna genes immediately 3' to an rrna operon. some of these 27 trna genes are very similar, but only 1 is exactly repeated in the cluster. the 5' end of this cluster has a gene order similar to that found in the 9- and 21-trna gene clusters of b. subtilis. the 3' end of this s. aureus cluster exhibits more similarity to the 16-trna gene cluster of b. subtilis. the 24th, 25th, and 26th trna genes of this s. aureus trna gene cluster code for three similar, unusual gly-trnas that may be used in the synthesis of the peptidoglycan in the cell wall but not in protein synthesis. southern analysis of restriction digests of s. aureus dna indicate that there are five to six rrna operons in this bacterium's genome and that most or all may have large trna gene clusters at the 3' end.

TI  == incompatibility of lactobacillus vectors with replicons derived from small cryptic lactobacillus plasmids and segregational instability of the introduced vectors.
AB  == three new lactobacillus vectors based on cryptic lactobacillus plasmids were constructed. the shuttle vector plp3537 consists of a 2.3-kb plasmid from lactobacillus pentosus md353, an erythromycin resistance gene from staphylococcus aureus plasmid pe194, and puc19 as a replicon for escherichia coli. the vectors plpe317 and plpe323, which do not contain e. coli sequences, were generated by introducing the erythromycin resistance gene of pe194 into a 1.7- and a 2.3-kb plasmid from l. pentosus md353, respectively. these vectors and the shuttle vector plp825 (m. posno, r. j. leer, j. m. m. van rijn, b. c. lokman, and p. h. pouwels, p. 397-401, in a. t. ganesan and j. a. hoch, ed., genetics and biotechnology of bacilli, vol. 2, 1988) could be introduced by electroporation into lactobacillus casei, l. pentosus, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, and l. brevis strains with similar efficiencies. transformation efficiencies were strain dependent and varied from 10 to 10 transformants per mug of dna. plasmid dna analysis of l. pentosus md353 transformants revealed that the introduction of plp3537 or plpe323 was invariably accompanied by loss of the endogenous 2.3-kb plasmid. remarkably, plpe317 could only be introduced into an l. pentosus md353 strain that had been previously cured of its endogenous 1.7-kb  plasmid. the curing phenomena are most likely to be explained by the incompatibility of the vectors and resident plasmids. lactobacillus vectors are generally rapidly lost when cells are cultivated in the absence of selective pressure. however, plpe323 is stable in three of four lactobacillus strains tested so far.

TI  == comparative characterization of spirosomes isolated from lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus buchneri.
AB  == spirosomes, cytoplasmic fine spirals, were isolated and purified from lactobacillus brevis atcc 8287, l. fermentum f-1, and l. buchneri atcc 4005, and  their morphological, biochemical, and immunological properties were investigated. the spirosomes of these lactobacilli were morphologically indistinguishable from  one another, and they had the same buoyant density of 1.320 g/cm3 in cscl. all of the spirosomes were composed of a single protein, spirosin, with an apparent molecular weight of about 95,000 for l. brevis and l. fermentum and of about 96,000 for l. buchneri as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel  electrophoresis (sds-page). the spirosins from the three lactobacilli were compared by peptide mapping on sds-page after cleavage with n-chlorosuccinimide and limited proteolysis with staphylococcus aureus v8 protease. the peptide map of the l. brevis spirosin was identical with that of the l. fermentum spirosin, whereas it was markedly different from the l. buchneri spirosin. the amino acid composition of the l. brevis spirosin was almost similar to that of the l. fermentum spirosin, while it differed appreciably from the l. buchneri spirosin.  using antiserum against the l. brevis spirosin, immunodiffusion test revealed that the antigenicity of the spirosomes from l. brevis was identical with that from l. fermentum, whereas it was partially different from that from l. buchneri.

TI  == effect of environmental conditions during soya-bean fermentation on the growth of staphylococcus aureus and production and thermal stability of enterotoxins a and  b.
AB  == during tempe manufacture, staphylococcus aureus was able to survive in newly started soya-bean soaks (final ph 4.7), whereas it died during soaks with accelerated souring (final ph 4.0). no s. aureus were detected after subsequent heat treatment of soaked beans. s. aureus strain s6 could produce enterotoxins a  and b if inoculated on cooked soya-beans. its growth and enterotoxin production were not influenced by inoculation rate nor by the presence of actively growing rhizopus oligosporus, the fungus responsible for tempe formation. enterotoxin levels were highest after 48 h fermentation. presence of lactobacilli (l. brevis  or l. plantarum) during the tempe fermentation did not influence staphylococcal growth, but enterotoxin levels were reduced. reduced oxygen pressure did not affect staphylococcal growth, but resulted in lower enterotoxin levels after 48 h incubation. the thermal stability of enterotoxin a in tempe was significantly lower than in brain heart infusion broth of comparable ph. heating of enterotoxin-containing tempe mash reduced enterotoxin a by 99.7% as measured with elisa and animal feeding methods.

TI  == evidence for the presence of heat-stable protein (hpr) and atp-dependent hpr kinase in heterofermentative lactobacilli lacking phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase activity.
AB  == an analysis of the biochemical basis for the lack of phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose  phosphotransferase activity in heterofermentative lactobacilli was carried out. extracts of lactobacillus brevis and lactobacillus buchneri failed to reconstitute phosphotransferase activity of extracts of staphylococcus aureus mutants impaired in the phosphotransferase system due to the absence of enzyme i, enzyme iilac, or enzyme iiilac activity, suggesting that these lactobacilli lack  those phosphotransferase system components. in contrast, complementation tests with an extract of a s. aureus mutant deficient in heat-stable protein (hpr) indicated the presence of hpr activity in heterofermentative lactobacilli. the hpr of l. brevis was purified and shown to have properties similar to those of a  typical hpr. in addition, l. brevis possesses an atp-dependent protein kinase that phosphorylates a serine residue of the endogenous hpr as well as other hprs  of gram-positive origin. the kinase activity is markedly stimulated by phosphorylated compounds related to sugar metabolism and is negatively modulated  by orthophosphate, pyrophosphate, or arsenate and by a low molecular weight endogenous factor. in keeping with the idea of a regulatory role for the phosphorylation of hpr in lactobacilli, a hpr[ser(p)] phosphatase activity in l.  brevis was also demonstrated. on the basis of the finding of hpr and a system for its reversible covalent modification in an organism devoid of a functional phosphotransferase system we propose that, in lactobacilli, hpr has a role in the regulation of pathways other than the phosphotransferase system.

TI  == regulation of beta-galactoside transport and accumulation in heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == galactose-grown cells of the heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria lactobacillus brevis and lactobacillus buchneri transported methyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside (tmg) by an active transport mechanism and accumulated intracellular free tmg when provided with an exogenous source of energy, such as arginine. the intracellular concentration of tmg resultant under  these conditions was approximately 20-fold higher than that in the medium. in contrast, the provision of energy by metabolism of glucose, gluconate, or glucosamine promoted a rapid but transient uptake of tmg followed by efflux that  established a low cellular concentration of the galactoside, i.e., only two- to fourfold higher than that in the medium. furthermore, the addition of glucose to  cells preloaded with tmg in the presence of arginine elicited a rapid efflux of the intracellular galactoside. the extent of cellular tmg displacement and the duration of the transient effect of glucose on tmg transport were related to the  initial concentration of glucose in the medium. exhaustion of glucose from the medium restored uptake and accumulation of tmg, providing arginine was available  for atp generation. the nonmetabolizable sugar 2-deoxyglucose elicited efflux of  tmg from preloaded cells of l. buchneri but not from those of l. brevis. phosphorylation of this glucose analog was catalyzed by cell extracts of l. buchneri but not by those of l. brevis. iodoacetate, at a concentration that inhibits growth and atp production from glucose, did not prevent efflux of cellular tmg elicited by glucose. the results suggested that a phosphorylated metabolite(s) at or above the level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate was required to evoke displacement of intracellular tmg from the cells. counterflow experiments suggested that glucose converted the active uptake of tmg in l. brevis to a facilitated diffusion mechanism that allowed equilibrium of tmg between the extra- and intracellular milieux. the means by which glucose metabolites elicited this vectorial regulation is not known, but similarities to the inducer expulsion that has been described for homofermentative streptococcus and lactobacillus species suggested the involvement of hpr, a protein that functions as a phosphocarrier protein in the phosphotransferase system, as well as a presumptive regulator of sugar transport. indeed, complementation assays wit extracts of staphylococcus aureus ptsh mutant revealed the presence of hpr in l. brevis, although this lactobacillus lacked a functional phaosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphortransferase system for glucose, 2-deoxyglucose, or tmg.

TI  == further studies on thymidine kinase: distribution pattern of the enzyme in bacteria.
AB  == various micro-organisms (131 strains of 73 species) were studied for their ability to produce thymidine kinase (tk; ec 2.7.1.21). taking the specific tk activity of escherichia coli k12 [specific activity of sonicated cell extracts 95-194 pmol min-1 (mg protein)-1] as 100%, the test organisms had the following relative specific tk activities. in the gram-positive cocci, staphylococcus aureus (21-84%) showed higher activity than staph. epidermidis (1-20%) and streptococcus (1-7%) except for one strain of strep. pyogenes (29%). neisseria sicca, a gram-negative coccus, lacked tk. gram-positive endospore-forming rods showed significant activity (bacillus, 13-51%; clostridium perfringens, 9-18%) except for one strain of b. megaterium (2%) and c. difficile (1-3%). among the gram-positive asporogenous rods, listeria monocytogenes and six species of lactobacillus (especially l. brevis, l. buchneri and l. casei) had moderate to high activity (23-348%) but l. acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. lactis and l. cellobiosus had low activity (0-8%). of the species of pseudomonas studied, most  lacked tk but ps. fluorescens and ps. maltophilia had significant tk activity (15-53%). of the gram-negative facultative anaerobes, vibrio lacked tk, while enterobacteriaceae, including salmonella (148-1120%), escherichia (59-141%), klebsiella (78-299%) and serratia (61-110%), had a high activity. proteus had a somewhat lower activity (0-34%) except for 'pr. rettgerella' (307%). propionibacterium and bifidobacterium and related organisms other than streptomyces, nocardia, rhodococcus, corynebacterium and mycobacterium lacked tk. the seven species of candida tested, and cryptococcus neoformans, essentially lacked tk.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == effect of lactic acid bacteria on growth of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == cultures of lactic acid bacteria, mostly from foods, were tested for their effect on the growth of staphylococcus aureus in trypticase soy broth (bbl). some of the effectors, e.g., streptococcus faecalis, s. faecium, lactobacillus lactis, l. brevis, and leuconostoc mesenteroides, stimulated growth of s. aureus during early hours of growth, especially at higher temperatures of incubation, but most  cultures were inhibitory, and some (s. faecium and l. mesenteroides) were even killing by the time of attainment of the maximal phase of growth of the staphylococcus. low-temperature meat lactobacilli and leuconostoc dextranicum inhibited s. aureus at 10, 15, 20, and 25 c throughout its growth. streptococcus  faecalis var. liquefaciens inhibited at these temperatures and at 30 and 37 c, as well. when the ratio of effectors to staphylococci in the inoculum was 100:1, the three enterococci, the meat lactobacillus, and l. dextranicum prevented the attainment of 5 x 10(6) staphylococci per milliliter at 15 c, and all but the meat lactobacillus did so at 22 c. a ratio of 1:1 accomplished similar results at 15 c, except that s. aureus was only delayed for 12 hr by s. faecalis. a ratio of 1:100 usually was ineffective. in general, the more effector bacteria there were  in the inoculum, the greater was the overall inhibition (or stimulation) of s. aureus. inhibition was most effective at 10 or 15 c, less so at 20 or 25 c, and least at 30 or 37 c, whereas stimulation during early growth was greater at the higher temperatures. results with different strains of the effectors and with two strains of s. aureus were similar, for the most part.
