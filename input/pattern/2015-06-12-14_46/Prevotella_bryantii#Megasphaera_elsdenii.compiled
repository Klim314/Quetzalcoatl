TI  - Effects of vanillin, quillaja saponin, and essential oils on in vitro fermentation and protein-degrading microorganisms of the rumen.
AB  - This study investigated the effects of vanillin on methanogenesis and rumen fermentation, and the responses of ruminal protein-degrading bacteria to vanillin (at concentrations of 0, 0.76 and 1.52 g/L), essential oils (clove oil, 1 g/L; origanum oil, 0.50 g/L, and peppermint oil, 1 g/L), and quillaja saponin (at concentration of 0 and 6 g/L) in vitro. Methane production, degradabilities of feed substrate, and ammonia concentration decreased linearly with increasing doses of vanillin. Concentration of total volatile fatty acids also decreased, whereas proportion of butyrate tended to increase linearly with increasing doses of vanillin. Protozoa population decreased, but abundances of Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Prevotella bryantii, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Prevotella ruminicola, Clostridium aminophilum, and Ruminobacter amylophilus increased with increasing doses of vanillin. Origanum and clove oils resulted in lower ammonia concentrations compared to control and peppermint oil. All the tested essential oils decreased abundances of protozoa, Selenomonas ruminantium, R. amylophilus, P. ruminicola and P. bryantii, with the largest decrease resulted from origanum oil followed by clove oil and peppermint oil. The abundances of Megasphaera elsdenii, C. aminophilum, and Clostridium sticklandii were deceased by origanum oil while that of B. fibrisolvens was lowered by both origanum and clove oils. Saponin decreased ammonia concentration and protozoal population, but increased the abundances of S. ruminantium, R. amylophilus, P. ruminicola, and P. bryantii, though the magnitude was small (less than one log unit). The results suggest that reduction of ammonia production by vanillin and saponin may not be caused by direct inhibition of major known proteolytic bacteria, and essential oils can have different inhibitory effects on different proteolytic bacteria, resulting in varying reduction in ammonia production.
TI  - Rumen microbial population dynamics during adaptation to a high-grain diet.
AB  - High-grain adaptation programs are widely used with feedlot cattle to balance enhanced growth performance against the risk of acidosis. This adaptation to a high-grain diet from a high-forage diet is known to change the rumen microbial population structure and help establish a stable microbial population within the rumen. Therefore, to evaluate bacterial population dynamics during adaptation to a high-grain diet, 4 ruminally cannulated beef steers were adapted to a high-grain diet using a step-up diet regimen containing grain and hay at ratios of 20:80, 40:60, 60:40, and 80:20. The rumen bacterial populations were evaluated at each stage of the step-up diet after 1 week of adaptation, before the steers were transitioned to the next stage of the diet, using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis, 16S rRNA gene libraries, and quantitative real-time PCR. The T-RFLP analysis displayed a shift in the rumen microbial population structure during the final two stages of the step-up diet. The 16S rRNA gene libraries demonstrated two distinct rumen microbial populations in hay-fed and high-grain-fed animals and detected only 24 common operational taxonomic units out of 398 and 315, respectively. The 16S rRNA gene libraries of hay-fed animals contained a significantly higher number of bacteria belonging to the phylum Fibrobacteres, whereas the 16S rRNA gene libraries of grain-fed animals contained a significantly higher number of bacteria belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes. Real-time PCR analysis detected significant fold increases in the Megasphaera elsdenii, Streptococcus bovis, Selenomonas ruminantium, and Prevotella bryantii populations during adaptation to the high-concentrate (high-grain) diet, whereas the Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and Fibrobacter succinogenes populations gradually decreased as the animals were adapted to the high-concentrate diet. This study evaluates the rumen microbial population using several molecular approaches and presents a broader picture of the rumen microbial population structure during adaptation to a high-grain diet from a forage diet.
TI  - Biotransformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by pure culture ruminal bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-one ruminal bacteria species were tested for their ability to degrade 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) within 24 h. Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Lactobacillus vitulinus, Selenomonas ruminantium, Streptococcus caprinus, and Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were able to completely degrade 100 mg/L TNT, with <5% of the original TNT recovered as diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. Eubacterium ruminantium, Lactobacillus ruminis, Ruminobacter amylophilus, Streptococcus bovis, and Wolinella succinogenes were able to completely degrade 100 mg/L TNT, with 23-60% of the TNT recovered as aminodinitrotoluene and/or diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. Clostridium polysaccharolyticum, Megasphaera elsdenii, Prevotella bryantii, Prevotella ruminicola, Ruminococcus albus, and Ruminococcus flavefaciens were able to degrade 80-90% of 100 mg/L TNT. Desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans, Prevotella albensis, and Treponema bryantii degraded 50-80% of the TNT. Anaerovibrio lipolytica was completely inhibited by 100 mg/L TNT. These results indicate that a variety of rumen bacteria is capable of transforming TNT.
TI  - Dominance of Prevotella and low abundance of classical ruminal bacterial species  in the bovine rumen revealed by relative quantification real-time PCR.
AB  - Relative quantification real-time PCR was used to quantify several bacterial species in ruminal samples from two lactating cows, each sampled 3 h after feeding on two successive days. Abundance of each target taxon was calculated as a fraction of the total 16S rRNA gene copies in the samples, using taxon-specific and eubacterial domain-level primers. Bacterial populations showed a clear predominance of members of the genus Prevotella, which comprised 42% to 60% of the bacterial rRNA gene copies in the samples. However, only 2% to 4% of the bacterial rRNA gene copies were represented by the classical ruminal Prevotella species Prevotella bryantii, Prevotella ruminicola and Prevotella brevis. The proportion of rRNA gene copies attributable to Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Selenomonas ruminantium and Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were each generally in the 0.5% to 1% range. Proportions for Ruminobacter amylophilus and Eubacterium ruminantium were lower (0.1% to 0.2%), while Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Streptococcus bovis, Ruminococcus albus and Megasphaera elsdenii were even less abundant, each comprising <0.03% of the bacterial rRNA gene copies. The data suggest that the aggregate abundance of the most intensively studied ruminal bacterial species is relatively low and that a large fraction of the uncultured population represents a single bacterial genus.
TI  - Influence of dipeptidyl peptidase inhibitors on growth, peptidase activity, and ammonia production by ruminal microorganisms.
AB  - The aim was to investigate known and potential new inhibitiors of dipeptidyl peptidases (DPP) for their effects on ruminal microorganisms. Gly-Phe diazomethylketone (GPD), Ala-Ala chloromethylketone (AAC), benserazide (DL-serine 2-(2,3,4- trihydroxybenzyl) hydrazide), and diprotin A (Ile-Pro-Ile) inhibited DPP activities of Prevotella albensis, P. ruminicola, P. bryantii, P. brevis, and mixed ruminal microorganisms, though incompletely and, except for diprotin A, without absolute specificity for any of the peptidases. Leucine aminopeptidase activity of Streptococcus bovis was also inhibited by GPD and benserazide. The inhibitors had no effect on the growth of the bacteria, except for GPD, which inhibited growth of P. albensis when only peptides were available for growth. Benserazide had some inhibitory effects on the growth of Megasphaera elsdenii and Prevotella spp., even in the absence of peptides. The predatory activity of ciliate protozoa on bacteria was unaffected by DPP inhibitors. Ammonia production from casein by mixed ruminal microorganisms was inhibited significantly (P < 0.05) by AAC (29% inhibition) and benserazide (33%). It was concluded that DPP inhibitors can influence the rate of NH3 production in the rumen and may form the basis for developing protein-sparing feed additives for ruminants.
