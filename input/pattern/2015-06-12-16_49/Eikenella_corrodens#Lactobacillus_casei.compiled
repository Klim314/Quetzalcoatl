TI  - Humoral IgG antibodies to oral microbiota in a population at risk for root-surface caries.
AB  - Mutans streptococci have been strongly implicated in the initiation of dental caries on coronal surfaces. Their role in development of root-surface caries is less clear. The etiologic agents of both types of dental caries are likely to elicit systemic immune responses. The objective of the present study, therefore, was to study the association of clinical variables of disease with humoral IgG antibodies to nine oral micro-organisms in 314 adult subjects, aged 45-65 years, who were at risk for root-surface caries. Antibody activity to Streptococcus mutans strain Ingbritt, S. mutans/S. sobrinus GTFs, S. faecalis strain 19433, Actinomyces viscosus strain WVU 626, Actinomyces naeslundii strain 12, Lactobacillus casei, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strain Y4, Porphyromonas gingivalis strain 381, Eikenella corrodens strain 1073, and Wolinella recta strain 371 was measured by ELISA. Pearson correlation coefficients among log10 antibody levels within subjects revealed marked positive correlations among subgingival bacteria, generally weak positive correlations among supragingival micro-organisms, and no correlations between elements of the supragingival battery with the subgingival battery. IgG antibody levels to mutans streptococcal antigens were significantly correlated with subject DMF scores (r = 0.23; p less than 0.0001). No significant correlation was seen between DMF scores and antibody to any other supragingival micro-organism tested. Further relationships between levels of S. mutans antibody and individual clinical variables were analyzed by step-wise multiple linear regression, resulting in a model that was highly significant (p = 0.0001), with an r2 = 0.14. Numbers of missing teeth, coronal caries, root-surface caries, and root-surface restorations were each positively associated with antibody levels to mutans streptococci.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Modulation of human neutrophil adherence by oral bacteria.
AB  - Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) comprise over 90 per cent of leukocytes in the oral cavity. Although these phagocytic cells have primary defence roles in the gingiva, their stimulation by micro-organisms may also cause substantial tissue damage due to the release of lysosomal enzymes and oxygen radicals. Adherence of PMNs to the endothelium and their subsequent diapedesis and egress to areas of infection are considered early vital events in the inflammatory process. In this study, oral bacteria were screened to determine their direct effects on PMN activation using an in vitro method of measuring PMN adherence to Dacron fibres. Most of the bacteria investigated increased PMN adherence, indicating their potential to cause tissue damage through the release of PMN lysosomal enzymes and other products. In contrast, Bacteroides species suppressed PMNs, indicating their ability to circumvent the phagocytic cells, thus gaining a potential advantage in dental colonization. The modulatory effects of oral bacteria on PMN activation may have significant roles in the immunopathogenesis of oral disease.
