TI  == rahnella sp. strain ek12: cell surface properties and diesel oil biodegradation after long-term contact with natural surfactants and diesel oil.
AB  == the changes in cell surface properties of rahnella sp. strain ek12 and modifications in genetic material after long-term contact with saponins and rhamnolipids, were investigated. rhamnolipids caused a decrease of hydrophobicity in liquid cultures compared with saponins. on the other hand, in cultures with rhamnolipids, the addition of diesel oil results in a rapid rise of cell surface  hydrophobicity. the similar effect was not so significant in the presence of saponins. for the bacteria grown in the presence of saponins or rhamnolipids, but without diesel oil, the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids decreased,  in comparison to the control culture. the differences observed in hydrophobicity, zeta potential and fatty acids profiles, indicated various mechanisms of an interaction between a surfactant and a bacterial cells. the results have also shown an impact of the long-term contact on changes in genetic material of rahnella sp. strain ek12 cells. moreover, the presence of saponins led to significant increase of diesel oil biodegradation.

TI  == phytoremediation of metal contaminated soil using willow: exploiting plant-associated bacteria to improve biomass production and metal uptake.
AB  == short rotation coppice (src) of willow and poplar is proposed for economic valorization and concurrently as remediation strategy for metal contaminated land in northeast-belgium. however, metal phytoextraction appears insufficient to effectuate rapid reduction of soil metal contents. to increase both biomass production and metal accumulation of src, two strategies are proposed: (i) in situ selection of the best performing clones and (ii) bioaugmentation of these clones with beneficial plant-associated bacteria. based on field data, two experimental willow clones, a salix viminalis and a salix alba x alba clone, were selected. compared to the best performing commercial clones, considerable increases in stem metal extraction were achieved (up to 74% for cd and 91% for zn). from the selected clones, plant-associated bacteria were isolated and identified. all strains were subsequently screened for their plant growth-promoting and metal uptake enhancing traits. five strains were selected for a greenhouse inoculation experiment with the selected clones planted in cd-zn-pb contaminated soil. extraction potential tended to increase after inoculation of s. viminalis plants with a rahnella sp. strain due to a significantly increased twig biomass. however, although bacterial strains showing beneficial traits in vitro were used for inoculation, increments in extraction potential were not always observed.

TI  == rouxiella chamberiensis gen. nov., sp. nov., a new enterobacteriaceae isolated from parenteral nutrition bags.
AB  == parenteral nutrition bags for newborns were found contaminated by a previously undescribed enterobacteriaceae. the six isolates studied by rrs - (encoding 16s rrna) and multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa) formed a discrete branch close to genera ewingella, rahnella, yersinia, hafnia and serratia. phenotypically, the new taxon was distinct from these four genera. the new taxon gave positive voges-proskauer, simmons citrate, o-nitrophenyl-beta-galactoside hydrolysis tests; fermented d-glucose, d-mannitol, l-rhamnose, d-melibiose, l-arabinose, d-xylose, and hydrolyzed esculin; did not ferment maltose, trehalose, raffinose,  d-sorbitol, sucrose and d-cellobiose. the following tests, motility, gas production, urease, gelatinase, and nitrate reduction were also negative. all isolates failed to grow at 37 degrees c. therefore, the new taxon is proposed as  a new species and genus and named rouxiella chamberiensis gen. nov., sp. nov. the type strain is 130333t (= cip 110714t = dsm 28324t). the g+c content of the type  strain dna was 53 mol%.

TI  == aerobic microbial community of insectary population of phlebotomus papatasi.
AB  == background: microbes particularly bacteria presenting in the gut of haematophagous insects may have an important role in the epidemiology of human infectious disease. methods: the microbial flora of gut and surrounding environmental of a laboratory strain of phlebotomus papatasi, the main vector of  zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (zcl) in the old world, was investigated. biochemical reactions and 16s rdna sequencing of the isolated bacteria against 24 sugars and amino acids were used for bacteria species identification. common mycological media used for fungi identification as well. results: most isolates belonged to the enterobacteriaceae, a large, heterogeneous group of gram-negative rods whose natural habitat is the intestinal tract of humans and animals. enterobacteriaceae groups included edwardsiella, enterobacter, escherichia, klebsiella, kluyvera, leminorella, pantoea, proteus, providencia, rahnella, serratia, shigella, tatumella, and yersinia and non enterobacteriaceae groups included bacillus, staphylococcus and pseudomonas. the most prevalent isolates were proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris. these saprophytic and swarming motile bacteria were isolated from all immature, pupae, and mature fed or unfed male or  female sand flies as well as from larval and adult food sources. five fungi species were also isolated from sand flies, their food sources and colonization materials where candida sp. was common in all mentioned sources. conclusion: midgut microbiota are increasingly seen as an important factor for modulating vector competence in insect vectors so their possible effects of the mirobiota on the biology of p. papatasi and their roles in the sandfly-leishmania interaction  are discussed.

TI  == rahnella victoriana sp. nov., rahnella bruchi sp. nov., rahnella woolbedingensis  sp. nov., classification of rahnella genomospecies 2 and 3 as rahnella variigena  sp. nov. and rahnella inusitata sp. nov., respectively and emended description of the genus rahnella.
AB  == isolations from oak symptomatic of acute oak decline, alder and walnut log tissue, and buprestid beetles in 2009-2012 yielded 32 gram-negative bacterial strains showing highest gyrb sequence similarity to rahnella aquatilis and ewingella americana. multilocus sequence analysis (using partial gyrb, rpob, infb and atpd gene sequences) delineated the strains into six mlsa groups. two mlsa groups contained reference strains of rahnella genomospecies 2 and 3, three groups clustered within the rahnella clade with no known type or reference strains and the last group contained the type strain of e. americana. dna-dna relatedness assays using both the microplate and fluorometric methods, confirmed  that each of the five rahnella mlsa groups formed separate taxa. rahnella genomospecies 2 and 3 were previously not formally described due to a lack of distinguishing phenotypic characteristics. in the present study, all five rahnella mlsa groups were phenotypically differentiated from each other and from  r. aquatilis. therefore we propose to classify the strains from symptomatic oak,  alder and walnut and buprestid beetles as: rahnella victoriana sp. nov. (type strain frb 225(t)=lmg 27717(t)=dsm 27397(t)), rahnella variigena sp. nov. (previously rahnella genomosp. 2, type strain cip 105588(t)=lmg 27711(t)), rahnella inusitata sp. nov. (previously rahnella genomosp. 3, type strain dsm 30078(t)=lmg 2640(t)), rahnella bruchi sp. nov. (type strain frb 226(t)=lmg 27718(t)=dsm 27398(t)) and rahnella woolbedingensis sp. nov. (type strain frb 227(t)=lmg 27719(t)=dsm 27399(t)).

TI  == cultivable bacteria isolated from apple trees cultivated under different crop systems: diversity and antagonistic activity against colletotrichum gloeosporioides.
AB  == this study evaluated the diversity of cultivable plant growth-promoting (pgp) bacteria associated with apple trees cultivated under different crop management systems and their antagonistic ability against colletotrichum gloeosporioides. samples of roots and rhizospheric soil from apple trees cultivated in organic and conventional orchards in southern brazil were collected, together with soil samples from an area never used for agriculture (native field). bacteria were identified at the genus level by pcr-rflp and partial sequencing of the 16s rrna, and were evaluated for some pgp abilities. the most abundant bacterial genera identified were enterobacter (27.7%), pseudomonas (18.7%), burkholderia (13.7%),  and rahnella (12.3%). sixty-nine isolates presented some antagonist activity against c. gloeosporioides. in a greenhouse experiment, five days after exposure  to c. gloeosporioides, an average of 30% of the leaf area of plants inoculated with isolate 89 (identified as burkholderia sp.) were infected, whereas 60 to 73% of the leaf area of untreated plants was affected by fungal attack. our results allowed us to infer how anthropogenic activity is affecting the bacterial communities in soil associated with apple tree crop systems, and to obtain an isolate that was able to delay the emergence of an important disease for this culture.

TI  == inoculation of lens culinaris with pb-resistant bacteria shows potential for phytostabilization.
AB  == phytoremediation comprises a set of plant and microbe-based technologies for remediation of soil heavy metal contamination. in this work, four pb-resistant bacteria (agrobacterium tumefaciens, rahnella aquatilis, and two pseudomonas sp.) were selected among a collection of isolates from root nodule of lens culinaris.  they had a high degree of bioaccumulation ability in nutrient medium containing 2 mm pb, and the maximum pb accumulation of whole cell was found after 48-h incubation. these pb-resistant bacteria synthesized plant growth promoting substances such as indole acetic acid and siderophore. the presence of the pb resistance genes (pbra) in these bacteria has been confirmed by pcr. l. culinaris cultivated in two experimental soils with different levels of contamination showed that pb contamination affected plant growth; therefore, it's co-inoculation with the consortium of pb-resistant bacteria improved plant biomass. the present study demonstrated that lentil accumulated pb primarily in their roots and poorly in their shoots; in addition, it's co-inoculation in moderately pb-contaminated soil induced a reduction in pb accumulation in roots and shoots by 22 and 80 %, respectively. whereas in highly pb-contaminated soil,  we registered a diminution in concentration of pb in shoots (66 %) and an augmentation in roots (21 %). the contamination of soil by pb caused an oxidative stress in lentil plant, inducing modulation in antioxidant enzymes activities, essentially in superoxide dismutase (sod) and peroxidase (gpox) activities which  were more pronounced in lentil cultivated in highly pb-contaminated soil, in addition, co-inoculation enhanced these activities, suggesting the protective role of enzymatic antioxidant against pb-induced plant stress.thus, the present study demonstrated that co-inoculation of lentil with a. tumefaciens, r. aquatilis, and pseudomonas sp. formed a symbiotic system useful for phytostabilization of highly and moderately pb-contaminated soils.

TI  == effects of ensiling fermentation and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community in italian ryegrass, guinea grass, and whole-crop maize silages stored  at high moisture content.
AB  == the effects of storage period and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community were examined in italian ryegrass (ir), guinea grass (gg), and whole-crop maize (wm) silages. direct-cut forages were stored in a laboratory silo for 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 120 d without any additives; live counts, content  of fermentation products, and characteristics of the bacterial community were determined. 2,3-butanediol, acetic acid, and lactic acid were the dominant fermentation products in the ir, gg, and wm silages, respectively. the acetic acid content increased as a result of prolonged ensiling, regardless of the type  of silage crop, and the changes were distinctively visible from the beginning of  gg ensiling. pantoea agglomerans, rahnella aquatilis, and enterobacter sp. were the major bacteria in the ir silage, indicating that alcoholic fermentation may be due to the activity of enterobacteria. staphylococcus sciuri and bacillus pumilus were detected when ir silage was spoiled, whereas between aerobically stable and unstable silages, no differences were seen in the bacterial community  at silo opening. lactococcus lactis was a representative bacterium, although acetic acid was the major fermentation product in the gg silage. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and morganella morganii were suggested to be associated with the increase in acetic acid due to prolonged storage. enterobacter cloacae appeared when the gg silage was spoiled. in the wm silage, no distinctive changes due to prolonged ensiling were seen in the bacterial community. throughout the ensiling, weissella paramesenteroides, weissella confusa, and klebsiella pneumoniae were present in addition to l. plantarum, l. brevis, and l. lactis. upon deterioration, acetobacter pasteurianus, klebsiella variicola, enterobacter hormaechei, and bacillus gibsonii were detected. these results demonstrate the diverse bacterial community that evolves during ensiling  and aerobic spoilage of ir, gg, and wm silages.

TI  == phosphate solubilization potential and modeling of stress tolerance of rhizobacteria from rice paddy soil in northern iran.
AB  == the purposes of this study were to evaluate the phosphate solubilization activity of bacteria isolated from the rhizosphere of rice paddy soil in northern iran, and to study the effect of temperature, nacl and ph on the growth of these isolates by modeling. three of the most effective strains from a total of 300 isolates were identified and a phylogenetic analysis was carried out by 16s rdna  sequencing. the isolates were identified as pantoea ananatis (m36), rahnella aquatilis (m100) and enterobacter sp. (m183). these isolates showed multiple plant growth-promoting attributes such as phosphate solubilization activity and indole-3-acetic acid (iaa) production. the m36, m100 and m183 isolates were able  to solubilize 172, 263 and 254 microg ml(-1) of ca3(po4)2 after 5 days of growth  at 28 degrees c and ph 7.5, and to produce 8.0, 2.0 and 3.0 mug ml(-1) of iaa when supplemented with l-tryptophan (1 mg ml(-1)) for 72 h, at 28 degrees c and ph 7.0, respectively. the solubilization of insoluble phosphate was associated with a drop in the ph of the culture medium and there was an inverse relationship between ph and solubilized p (r = -0.98, p < 0.0952). there were no significant differences among isolates in terms of acidity tolerance based on their confidence limits as assessed by segmented model analysis and all isolates were able to grow at ph 4.3-11 (with optimum at 7.0-7.5). based on a sigmoidal trend of a three-parameter logistic model, the salt concentration required for 50 % inhibition was 8.15, 6.30 and 8.23 % nacl for m36, m100 and m183 isolates, respectively. moreover, the minimum and maximum growth temperatures estimated by  the segmented model were 5.0 and 42.75 degrees c for m36, 12.76 and 40.32 degrees c for m100, and 10.63 and 43.66 degrees c for m183. the three selected isolates could be deployed as inoculants to promote plant growth in an agricultural environment.

TI  == identification of effective pb resistant bacteria isolated from lens culinaris growing in lead contaminated soils.
AB  == soil bacteria are a new phytoremediation system for the removal of heavy metals from soils. in this study, fifteen soil bacteria were isolated from root nodules  of lentil growing in heavy metals contaminated soils, particularly by lead. molecular characterization of the collection showed a large diversity, including  agrobacterium tumefaciens, rahnella aquatilis, pseudomonas, and rhizobium sp. these soil bacteria had a wide range of tolerance to heavy metals. among them, strains of a. tumefaciens and r. aquatilis tolerated up to 3.35 mm pb; whereas pseudomonas tolerated up to 3.24 mm pb. the inoculation of lentil grown hydroponically with inoculums formed by these efficient and pb resistant bacteria enhanced plant biomass. the treatment of this symbiosis by 1 mm pb for 10 days or by 2 mm pb for 3 days demonstrated that lentil had pb accumulation capacity and can be considered a pb accumulator plant, elsewhere, roots accumulated more pb than shoots, and the inoculation decreased the pb up take by the plants, suggesting that this symbiosis should be investigated for use in phytostabilization of pb-contaminated soils. at the same time, a modulation in the antioxidant enzyme activity and a specific duration was required for the induction of the superoxide dismutase (sod), peroxidase (pox), and ascorbate peroxidase (apx) response and to adapt to pb stress. these results suggested that these enzymes may be involved in the main mechanism of antioxidative defense in lentil exposed to pb oxidative stress.

TI  == arsenic-tolerant plant-growth-promoting bacteria isolated from arsenic-polluted soils in south korea.
AB  == the janghang smelter in chungnam, south korea started in 1936 was subsequently shutdown in 1989 due to heavy metal (loid) pollution concerns in the vicinity. thus, there is a need for the soil in the area to be remediated to make it usable again especially for agricultural purposes. the present study was conducted to exploit the potential of arsenic (as)-tolerant bacteria thriving in the vicinity  of the smelter-polluted soils to enhance phytoremediation of hazardous as. we studied the genetic and taxonomic diversity of 21 as-tolerant bacteria isolated from soils nearer to and away from the smelter. these isolates belonging to the genera brevibacterium, pseudomonas, microbacterium, rhodococcus, rahnella, and paenibacillus, could tolerate high concentrations of arsenite (as(iii)) and arsenate (as(v)) with the minimum inhibitory concentration ranging from 3 to >20  mm for naaso2 and 140 to 310 mm nah2aso4 . 7h2o, respectively. all isolates exhibited as(v) reduction except pseudomonas koreensis js123, which exhibited both oxidation and reduction of as. moreover, all the 21 isolates produced indole acetic acid (iaa), 13 isolates exhibited 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (acc) deaminase activity, 12 produced siderophore, 17 solubilized phosphate, and  13 were putative nitrogen fixers under in vitro conditions. particularly, rhodococcus aetherivorans js2210, p. koreensis js2214, and pseudomonas sp. js238  consistently increased root length of maize in the presence of 100 and 200 mum as(v). possible utilization of these as-tolerant plant-growth-promoting bacteria  can be a potential strategy in increasing the efficiency of phytoremediation in as-polluted soils.

TI  == interactions of three soil bacteria species with phyllosilicate surfaces in hybrid silica gels.
AB  == to simulate iron consumption in soils, iron leaching from silicate minerals due to three heterotrophic bacterial strains and a chemical treatment was studied using hybrid silica gel (hsg) doped with two phyllosilicates, nontronite (nau-2)  or low-iron-content montmorillonite (swy-2). hsg methodology, a novel way of separating bacteria cells from a colloidal mineral source, consisted in embedding colloidal mineral particles into an amorphous porous silica matrix using a classical sol-gel procedure. pantoae agglomerans pa1 and rahnella aquatilis ra1 were isolated from silicate-rich soils, that is, beech and wheat rhizospheres (vosges, france); burkholderia sp. g5 was selected from acidic and nutrient-poor  podzol soils (vosges, france). fe release from clay minerals and production of bacterial metabolites, that is, low molecular weight organic acids (lmwoa) and siderophores, were monitored. two lmwoa profiles were observed with major gluconate production (> 9000 mum) for burkholderia sp. g5 and moderate production of lactate, acetate, propionate, formate, oxalate, citrate, and succinate (< 300  mum) for r. aquatilis ra1 and p. agglomerans pa1. hsg demonstrated its usefulness in revealing clay mineral-microorganisms interactions. the effect of bacterial exsudates was clearly separated from physical contact effect.

TI  == [screening, identification and phosphate-solubilizing characteristics of rahnella sp. phosphate-solubilizing bacteria in calcareous soil].
AB  == several strains of phosphate-solubilizing bacteria were isolated and screened from the crop rhizosphere of calcareous soil in shanxi province of china. after repeated isolation and purification, the strain w25 with strong phosphate-solubilizing activity was obtained, and identified as rahnella sp., based on the morphological, physiological and biochemical properties and the analysis of 16s rrna gene sequence. further studies on the w25 showed that the maximum phosphate-solubilizing capability of the w25 on tricalium phosphate, aluminum phosphate and ferric phosphate reached 385.5, 110.4 and 216.6 mg x l(-1), respectively. in the liquid culture with aluminum phosphate and ferric phosphate, the solubilized phosphorous by the w25 was significantly negatively correlated with the liquid ph, with the correlation coefficient being 0.56 and 0.81, respectively. among the carbon and nitrogen sources, glucose and ammonium nitrate were the optimum for the solubilization of tricalium phosphate by w25. the utilization of carbon source was in the order of glucose > lactose > sucrose  > mannitose > starch, and that of nitrogen source was in the order of ammonium nitrate > ammonium chloride > ammonium sulfate > potassium nitrate > sodium nitrate. different nitrogen sources had greater effects on the production of organic acids by w25. formic acid and acetic acid would be produced when the nitrogen source was nh4+, oxalic acid and succinic acid would be produced when the nitrogen source was no3(-), and citric acid would be extra produced when the  ammonium nitrate was used as the nitrogen source.

TI  == enhancement of cd phytoextraction by two amaranthus species with endophytic rahnella sp. jn27.
AB  == microbe-assisted phytoextraction shows a potential for the remediation of metal-contaminated soils. the aim of this study was to isolate, characterize, and evaluate the potential of endophytic bacteria in improving plant growth and metal uptake by cd-hyperaccumulators-amaranthus hypochondriacus and amaranthus mangostanus. an endophytic bacterial strain jn27 isolated from roots of zea mays  displayed high tolerance and mobilization to cd, and was identified as rahnella sp. based on 16s rdna sequencing. the strain also exhibited multiple plant growth beneficial features including the production of indole-3-acetic acid, siderophore, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase and solubilization of insoluble phosphate. subsequently, a pot trial was performed to elucidate the  effects of inoculation with jn27 on plant growth and cd uptake by a. hypochondriacus, a. mangostanus, solanum nigrum and z. mays grown in soils with different levels of cd (25, 50, 100 mg cd kg(-1)). the results revealed that inoculation with jn27 significantly increased the biomasses of all the tested plants and the cd concentrations of all the tested plants except z. mays in both  above-ground and root tissues. moreover, strain jn27 could successfully re-colonized in rhizosphere soils of all the tested plants and root interior of a. hypochondriacus and z. mays. the present results indicated that the symbiont of a. hypochondriacus (or a. mangostanus) and strain jn27 can effectively improve the cd uptake by plants and would be a new strategy in microbe-assisted phytoextraction for metal-contaminated soils.

TI  == diversity of sporadic symbionts and nonsymbiotic endophytic bacteria isolated from nodules of woody, shrub, and food legumes in ethiopia.
AB  == fifty-five bacterial isolates were obtained from surface-sterilized nodules of woody and shrub legumes growing in ethiopia: crotalaria spp., indigofera spp., and erythrina brucei, and the food legumes soybean and common bean. based on partial 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, the majority of the isolates were identified as gram-negative bacteria belonging to the genera achromobacter, agrobacterium, burkholderia, cronobacter, enterobacter, mesorhizobium, novosphingobium, pantoea, pseudomonas, rahnella, rhizobium, serratia, and variovorax. seven isolates were gram-positive bacteria belonging to the genera bacillus, paenibacillus, planomicrobium, and rhodococcus. amplified fragment length polymorphism (aflp) fingerprinting showed that each strain was genetically distinct. according to phylogenetic analysis of reca, glnii, rpob, and 16s rrna gene sequences, rhizobium, mesorhizobium, and agrobacterium were further classified into six different genospecies: agrobacterium spp., agrobacterium radiobacter, rhizobium sp., rhizobium phaseoli, mesorhizobium sp., and putative new rhizobium species. the strains from r. phaseoli, rhizobium sp. iar30, and mesorhizobium sp. err6 induced nodules on their host plants. the other strains did not form nodules on their original host. nine endophytic bacterial strains representing seven genera, agrobacterium, burkholderia, paenibacillus, pantoea, pseudomonas, rhizobium, and serratia, were found to colonize nodules of crotalaria incana and common bean on co-inoculation with symbiotic rhizobia. four endophytic rhizobium and two agrobacterium strains had identical nifh gene sequences with symbiotic rhizobium strains, suggesting horizontal gene transfer.  most symbiotic and nonsymbiotic endophytic bacteria showed plant growth-promoting properties in vitro, which indicate their potential role in the promotion of plant growth when colonizing plant roots and the rhizosphere.

TI  == comparative analysis of midgut bacterial communities of aedes aegypti mosquito strains varying in vector competence to dengue virus.
AB  == differences in midgut bacterial communities of aedes aegypti, the primary mosquito vector of dengue viruses (denv), might influence the susceptibility of these mosquitoes to infection by denv. as a first step toward addressing this hypothesis, comparative analysis of bacterial communities from midguts of mosquito strains with differential genetic susceptibility to denv was performed.  16s rrna gene libraries and real-time pcr approaches were used to characterize midgut bacterial community composition and abundance in three aedes aegypti strains: moyo, moyo-r, and moyo-s. although pseudomonas spp.-related clones were  predominant across all libraries, some interesting and potentially significant differences were found in midgut bacterial communities among the three strains. pedobacter sp.- and janthinobacterium sp.-related phylotypes were identified only in the moyo-r strain libraries, while bacillus sp. was detected only in the moyo-s strain. rahnella sp. was found in moyo-r and moyo strains libraries but was absent in moyo-s libraries. both 16s rrna gene library and real-time pcr approaches confirmed the presence of pedobacter sp. only in the moyo-r strain. further, real-time pcr-based quantification of 16s rrna gene copies showed bacterial abundance in midguts of the moyo-r strain mosquitoes to be at least 10-100-folds higher than in the moyo-s and moyo strain mosquitoes. our study identified some putative bacteria with characteristic physiological properties that could affect the infectivity of dengue virus. this analysis represents the first report of comparisons of midgut bacterial communities with respect to refractoriness and susceptibility of aedes aegypti mosquitoes to denv and will guide future efforts to address the potential interactive role of midgut bacteria of aedes aegypti mosquitoes in determining vectorial capacity for denv.

TI  == changes in the bacterial community and composition of fermentation products during ensiling of wilted italian ryegrass and wilted guinea grass silages.
AB  == to gain further insights into temperate and tropical grass ensiling, fermentation products and bacterial communities were examined at both the initial and late stages of ensiling of wilted italian ryegrass and wilted guinea grass silages. 2,3-butanediol and ethanol fermentation were observed in wilted italian ryegrass  silage. enterobacteria such as rahnella sp. and enterobacter sp. may have been involved in fermentation; however, alcohol production was intensified after the silage enterobacterial community overwhelmed the pre-ensiled enterobacterial community. pediococcus spp. appeared in silage stored for 4 months, when a significant increase in lactic acid content was seen compared with that at 2 months. prolonged storage enhanced acetic acid fermentation in wilted guinea grass silage. the disappearance of enterococcus sulfureus and appearance of lactobacillus plantarum may have been associated with the increased acetic acid content. although many species of enterobacteria were found in common between the pre-ensiled crop and silages of italian ryegrass and guinea grass, marked differences were seen in the type of fermentation from the initial stages. these  results indicate that the bacterial community of pre-ensiled crops may be immediately replaced by one that is adapted to ensiling environments, although metabolic changes may continue over the course of ensiling.

TI  == reversible oxygen-tolerant hydrogenase carried by free-living n2-fixing bacteria  isolated from the rhizospheres of rice, maize, and wheat.
AB  == hydrogen production by microorganisms is often described as a promising sustainable and clean energy source, but still faces several obstacles, which prevent practical application. among them, oxygen sensitivity of hydrogenases represents one of the major limitations hampering the biotechnological implementation of photobiological production processes. here, we describe a hierarchical biodiversity-based approach, including a chemochromic screening of hydrogenase activity of hundreds of bacterial strains collected from several ecosystems, followed by mass spectrometry measurements of hydrogenase activity of a selection of the h(2)-oxidizing bacterial strains identified during the screen. in all, 131 of 1266 strains, isolated from cereal rhizospheres and basins containing irradiating waste, were scored as h(2)-oxidizing bacteria, including pseudomonas sp., serratia sp., stenotrophomonas sp., enterobacter sp., rahnella sp., burkholderia sp., and ralstonia sp. isolates. four free-living n(2)-fixing bacteria harbored a high and oxygen-tolerant hydrogenase activity, which was not  fully inhibited within entire cells up to 150-250 mumol/l o(2) concentration or within soluble protein extracts up to 25-30 mumol/l. the only hydrogenase-related genes that we could reveal in these strains were of the hyc type (subunits of formate hydrogenlyase complex). the four free-living n(2)-fixing bacteria were closely related to enterobacter radicincitans based on the sequences of four genes (16s rrna, rpob, hsp60, and hyce genes). these results should bring interesting prospects for microbial biohydrogen production and might have ecophysiological significance for bacterial adaptation to the oxic-anoxic interfaces in the rhizosphere.

TI  == characterization of endophytic rahnella sp. jn6 from polygonum pubescens and its  potential in promoting growth and cd, pb, zn uptake by brassica napus.
AB  == microbe-assisted phytoremediation has been considered as a promising measure for  the remediation of heavy metal-polluted soils. in this study, a metal-tolerance and plant growth-promoting endophytic bacterium jn6 was firstly isolated from roots of mn-hyperaccumulator polygonum pubescens grown in metal-contaminated soil and identified as rahnella sp. based on 16s rdna gene sequence analysis. strain jn6 showed very high cd, pb and zn tolerance and effectively solubilized cdco(3), pbco(3) and zn(3)(po(4))(2) in culture solution. the isolate produced plant growth-promoting substances such as indole-3-acetic acid, siderophore, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic deaminase, and also solubilized inorganic phosphate. based upon its ability in metal tolerance and solubilization, the isolate jn6 was further studied for its effects on the growth and accumulation of cd, pb and zn in brassica napus (rape) by pot experiments. rape plants inoculated with the isolate jn6 had significantly higher dry weights, concentrations and uptake of cd, pb and zn in both above-ground and root tissues than those without  inoculation grown in soils amended with cd (25 mg kg(-1)), pb (200 mg kg(-1)) or  zn (200 mg kg(-1)). the isolate also showed a high level of colonization in tissue interior of rapes. the present results demonstrated that rahnella sp. jn6  is a valuable microorganism, which can cost-effectively improve the efficiency of phytoremediation in soils contaminated by cd, pb and zn.

TI  == bacteria from ips sexdentatus (coleoptera: curculionidae) and their biocontrol potential.
AB  == ips sexdentatus (coleoptera: curculionidae) is one of the most destructive pests  of the spruce trees in europe. in this study, we have isolated and characterized  culturable bacteria from i. sexdentatus and tested their insecticidal activity against the last instar larvae of the pest as a possible biocontrol agent. a total of eight bacterial isolates was determined and four of them were identified at species level, and the others were identified at genus level. isolates were identified as stenotrophomonas maltophilia (is1), rahnella sp. (is2), pseudomonas sp. (is3), bacillus sp. (is4), alcaligenes faecalis (is5), panteoea agglomerans (is6), pseudomonas fluorescens (is7) and serratia sp. (is8) based on their morphological, biochemical and molecular characteristics. insecticidal effects of bacterial isolates were performed on the last instar larvae of the pest. the highest insecticidal activity was obtained from p. fluorescens (is7) with 73% mortality within 10 days after inoculation (p < 0.05). mortality values of the other isolates ranged from 20 to 53%. this study suggests that pseudomonas fluorescens (is7) seems to be a good candidate as a possible biocontrol agent against i. sexdentatus, and provides suitable strains that can be modified to express insecticidal toxins and/or other detrimental substances to develop new control methods for i. sexdentatus.

TI  == evaluation of positron emission tomography as a method to visualize subsurface microbial processes.
AB  == positron emission tomography (pet) provides spatiotemporal monitoring in a nondestructive manner and has higher sensitivity and resolution relative to other tomographic methods. therefore, this technology was evaluated for its application to monitor in situ subsurface bacterial activity. to date, however, it has not been used to monitor or image soil microbial processes. in this study, pet imaging was applied as a "proof-of-principle" method to assess the feasibility of visualizing a radiotracer labeled subsurface bacterial strain (rahnella sp. y9602), previously isolated from uranium contaminated soils and shown to promote  uranium phosphate precipitation. soil columns packed with acid-purified simulated mineral soils were seeded with 2-deoxy-2-[(18)f]fluoro-d-glucose ((18)fdg) labeled rahnella sp. y9602. the applicability of [(18)f]fluoride ion as a tracer  for measuring hydraulic conductivity and (18)fdg as a tracer to identify subsurface metabolically active bacteria was successful in our soil column studies. our findings indicate that positron-emitting isotopes can be utilized for studies aimed at elucidating subsurface microbiology and geochemical processes important in contaminant remediation.

TI  == exploring new strains of dye-decolorizing bacteria.
AB  == this study unveiled a new strategy to explore new indigenous strains with excellent decolorization capabilities from freshwaters and seawaters. two new bacterial decolorizers dx2b and sh7b, which have the capability to decolorize textile dyes, were isolated from cross-strait taiwan and china. according to pcr-augmented 16s rrna gene analyses for strain identification, >99% of nucleotide sequences in isolated strains were identical to type strains rahnella  aquatilis, acinetobacter guillouiae, microvirgula aerodenitrificans, and pseudomonas sp. time-series inspection upon azoreductase activity assay and generation of decolorized intermediates all confirmed in parallel with reductive  decolorization of new decolorizers dx2b and sh7b. the result also showed that bacterial decolorization of these new strains was mainly catalyzed via the enzymatic expression of azoreductase and riboflavin reductase, and biosorption seemed not to play a crucial role color removal (approximately <10%).

TI  == identification of the midgut microbiota of an. stephensi and an. maculipennis for their application as a paratransgenic tool against malaria.
AB  == the midgut microbiota associated with anopheles stephensi and anopheles maculipennis (diptera: culicidae) was investigated for development of a paratransgenesis-based approach to control malaria transmission in eastern mediterranean region (emr). here, we present the results of a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and biochemical-based approaches to identify the female adult and  larvae mosquitoe microbiota of these two major malaria vectors, originated from south eastern and north of iran. plating the mosquito midgut contents from lab-reared and field-collected anopheles spp. was used for microbiota isolation.  the gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial colonies were identified by gram staining and specific mediums. selected colonies were identified by differential  biochemical tests and 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. a number of 10 an. stephensi and 32 an. maculipennis adult mosquitoes and 15 an. stephensi and 7 an. maculipennis larvae were analyzed and 13 sequences of 16s rrna gene bacterial species were retrieved, that were categorized in 3 classes and 8 families. the majority of the identified bacteria were belonged to the gamma-proteobacteria class, including pseudomonas sp. and aeromonas sp. and the others were some closely related to those found in other vector mosquitoes, including pantoea, acinetobacter, brevundimonas, bacillus, sphingomonas, lysinibacillus and rahnella. the 16s rrna sequences in the current study aligned with the reference  strains available in genbank were used for construction of the phylogenetic tree  that revealed the relatedness among the bacteria identified. the presented data strongly encourage further investigations, to verify the potential role of the detected bacteria for the malaria control in iran and neighboring countries.

TI  == monitoring the bacterial community of maize silage stored in a bunker silo inoculated with enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus buchneri.
AB  == aims: to monitor variations in the bacterial community and fermentation products  of maize silage within and between bunker silos. methods and results: silage samples were collected in 2008 and 2009 from three dairy farms, wherein the farmers arranged for a contractor to produce maize silage using bunker silos. silage was prepared using a lactic acid bacteria (lab) inoculant consisting of enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus buchneri. eight samples were collected from each bunker silo; 4 'outer' and 4 'inner' samples were collected from near the top and the bottom of the silo. the dry matter, lactic acid, acetic acid, ethanol, 1-propanol and 1,2-propanediol contents differed between bunker silos in both sampling years. higher acetic acid, 1-propanol and 1,2-propanediol contents were found in the bottom than the top layers in the 2008 samples, and higher lactic acid content was found in the top than the bottom layers in the 2009 samples. the bacterial community varied more between bunker silos than within a bunker silo in the 2008 samples, whereas differences between the top and the bottom layers were seen across bunker silos in the 2009 samples. the inoculated lab were uniformly distributed, while several nonconventional silage bacteria were also detected. lactobacillus acetotolerans,  lactobacillus panis and acetobacter pasteurianus were detected in both years. stenotrophomonas maltophilia was detected in the 2008 samples, and lactobacillus  reuteri, acinetobacter sp. and rahnella sp. were detected in the 2009 samples. conclusions: although differences were seen within and between bunker silos, the  bacterial community may indicate a different relationship between bunker silos and sampling locations within a bunker silo from that indicated by the fermentation products. significance and impact of the study: analysis of bacterial community can help understand how diverse non-lab and lab species are involved in the ensiling process of bunker-made maize silage.

TI  == cold-adapted and rhizosphere-competent strain of rahnella sp. with broad-spectrum plant growth-promotion potential.
AB  == a phosphate-solubilizing bacterial strain isolated from hippophae rhamnoides rhizosphere was identified as rahnella sp. based on its phenotypic features and 16s rrna gene sequence. the bacterial strain showed the growth characteristics of a cold-adapted psychrotroph, with the multiple plant growth-promoting traits of inorganic and organic phosphate solubilization, 1-aminocyclopropane-1- carboxylate-deaminase activity, ammonia generation, and siderophore production. the strain also produced indole- 3-acetic acid, indole-3-acetaldehyde, indole-3-acetamide, indole-3-acetonitrile, indole-3-lactic acid, and indole-3- pyruvic acid in tryptophan-supplemented nutrient broth. gluconic, citric and isocitric acids were the major organic acids detected during tricalcium phosphate solubilization. a rifampicin-resistant mutant of the strain exhibited high rhizosphere competence without disturbance to the resident microbial populations  in pea rhizosphere. seed bacterization with a charcoal-based inoculum significantly increased growth in barley, chickpea, pea, and maize under the controlled environment. microplot testing of the inoculum at two different locations in pea also showed significant increase in growth and yield. the attributes of coldtolerance, high rhizosphere competence, and broad-spectrum plant growth-promoting activity exhibited the potential of rahnella sp. bihb 783  for increasing agriculture productivity.

TI  == organic and conventional fruits and vegetables contain equivalent counts of gram-negative bacteria expressing resistance to antibacterial agents.
AB  == resistance to antibiotics is a major public health problem which might culminate  in outbreaks caused by pathogenic bacteria untreatable by known antibiotics. most of the genes conferring resistance are acquired horizontally from already resistant commensal or environmental bacteria. food contamination by resistant bacteria might be a significant source of resistance genes for human bacteria but has never been precisely assessed, nor is it known whether organic products differ in this respect from conventionally produced products. we showed here, on  a large year-long constructed sample set containing 399 products that, irrespective of their mode of production, raw fruits and vegetables are heavily contaminated by gram-negative bacteria (gnb) resistant to multiple antibiotics. most of these bacteria originate in the soil and environment. we focused on non-oxidative gnb resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, because of their  potential impact on human health. among them, species potentially pathogenic for  immunocompetent hosts were rare. of the products tested, 13% carried bacteria producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, all identified as rahnella sp. which grouped into two phylotypes and all carrying the bla(rahn) gene. thus, both organic and conventional fruits and vegetables may constitute significant sources of resistant bacteria and of resistance genes.

AB  == in this study, the immobilization of toxic uranium [u(vi)] mediated by the intrinsic phosphatase activities of naturally occurring bacteria isolated from contaminated subsurface soils was examined. the phosphatase phenotypes of strains belonging to the genera, arthrobacter, bacillus and rahnella, previously isolated from subsurface soils at the us department of energy's (doe) oak ridge field research center (orfrc), were determined. the orfrc represents a unique, extreme  environment consisting of highly acidic soils with co-occurring heavy metals, radionuclides and high nitrate concentrations. isolates exhibiting phosphatase-positive phenotypes indicative of constitutive phosphatase activity were subsequently tested in u(vi) bioprecipitation assays. when aerobically grown in synthetic groundwater (ph 5.5) amended with 10 mm glycerol-3-phosphate (g3p),  phosphatase-positive bacillus and rahnella spp. strains y9-2 and y9602 liberated  sufficient phosphate to precipitate 73% and 95% of total soluble u added as 200 microm uranyl acetate respectively. in contrast, an arthrobacter sp. x34 exhibiting a phosphatase-negative phenotype did not liberate phosphate from g3p or promote u(vi) precipitation. this study provides the first evidence of u(vi) precipitation via the phosphatase activity of naturally occurring bacillus and rahnella spp. isolated from the acidic subsurface at the doe orfrc.

TI  == atrazine degradation by aerobic microorganisms isolated from the rhizosphere of sweet flag (acorus calamus l.).
AB  == in presented study the capability of microorganisms isolated from the rhizosphere of sweet flag (acorus calamus) to the atrazine degradation was assessed. following isolation of the microorganisms counts of psychrophilic bacteria, mesophilic bacteria and fungi were determined. isolated microorganisms were screened in terms of their ability to decompose a triazine herbicide, atrazine. our results demonstrate that within the rhizosphere of sweet flag there were 3.8x10(7) cfu of psychrophilic bacteria, 1.8x10(7) cfu of mesophilic bacteria, and 6x10(5) cfu of fungi per 1 g of dry root mass. these microorganisms were represented by more than 20 different strains, and at the first step these strains were grown for 5 days in the presence of atrazine at a concentration of 5 mg/l. in terms of the effect of this trial culture, the bacteria reduced the level of atrazine by an average of about 2-20%, but the average level of reduction by fungi was in the range 18-60%. the most active strains involved in atrazine reduction were then selected and identified. these strains were classified as stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacillus licheniformis, bacillus megaterium, rahnella aquatilis (three strains), umbelopsis isabellina, volutella  ciliata and botrytis cinerea. culturing of the microorganisms for a longer time resulted in high atrazine degradation level. the highest degradation level was observed at atrazine concentrations of 5 mg/l for s. maltophilia (83.5% after 15  days of culture) and for botrytis sp. (82% after 21 days of culture). our results indicate that microorganisms of the sweet flag rhizosphere can play an important  role in the bioremediation of atrazine-contaminated sites.

TI  == isolation and characterization of cold-adapted strains producing beta-galactosidase.
AB  == beta-galactosidase is extensively employed in the manufacture of dairy products,  including lactose-reduced milk. here, we have isolated two gram-negative and rod-shaped coldadapted bacteria, bs 1 and hs 39. these strains were able to break down lactose at low temperatures. although two isolates were found to grow well at 10 degrees , the bs 1 strain was unable to grow at 37 degrees . another strain, hs-39, evidenced retarded growth at 37 degrees . the biochemical characteristics and the results of 16s rdna sequencing identified the bs 1 isolate as rahnella aquatilis, and showed that the hs 39 strain belonged to genus buttiauxella. whereas the r. aquatilis bs 1 strain generated maximal quantities of beta-galactosidase when incubated for 60 h at 10 degrees , buttiauxella sp. hs-39 generated beta-galactosidase earlier, and at slightly lower levels, than r. aquatilis bs 1. the optimum temperature for beta-galactosidase was 30 degrees for r. aquatilis bs-1, and was 45 degrees for buttiauxella sp. hs-39, thereby indicating that r. aquatilis bs-1 was able to generate a cold-adaptive enzyme. these two cold-adapted strains, and most notably the beta-galactosidase from each isolate, might prove useful in some biotechnological applications.

TI  == response of furniture factory workers to work-related airborne allergens.
AB  == the aim of this work was to determine the reactivity of furniture factory workers to microbial allergens associated with wood dust. allergological examinations by  skin and precipitin tests were performed in 48 workers employed in a factory producing furniture from fibreboards and chipboards, and in 32 healthy urban dwellers not exposed to organic dusts (referents). the skin test was performed by the intradermal method with the saline extracts of the cultures of 3 microbial species (rahnella sp., arthrobacter globiformis, aspergillus fumigatus) associated with wood dust. skin reactions were recorded after 20 minutes, 8 hours and 24 hours and graded 1-4, depending on the diameter of the reaction. the agar-gel test for the presence of precipitins in serum was performed with the extracts of 15 microbial isolates. the furniture factory workers showed a high skin response to the extracts of environmental microbes. the frequency of early grade 2 reactions (diameter 10 mm) to the extract of rahnella sp. was 64.6% among furniture workers, being significantly higher (p < 0.001) compared to reference group (18.7%). high frequencies of grade 2 reactions in furniture workers were also found with the extracts of a. globiformis and a. fumigatus (52.1% and 62.5%, respectively). the frequencies of grade 2 delayed (after 8 h) and late (after 24  h) reactions to rahnella sp. in furniture workers were non-specifically high (97.9%/93.7%) while the response rates to a. globiformis and a. fumigatus were much lower (10.4%/25.0%, and 4.2%/37.5%, respectively). in agar-gel test for detection of precipitins, in most cases very low percentages of positive reactions (0-2.1%) were noted in furniture factory workers. the only exception was a high percentage of positive reactions (27.1%) to the antigen of pseudomonas maltophilia, which was significantly greater in furniture workers compared to the reference group (p < 0.01). the obtained results suggest that early allergic reactions to microorganisms associated with wood dust are common among workers of furniture industry, which may increase a potential risk of work-related disease in this occupational group.

TI  == response of sawmill workers to work-related airborne allergens.
AB  == the aim of this work was to determine the reactivity of sawmill workers to biological allergens associated with wood dust. allergological examinations by skin and precipitin tests were performed in 43 workers employed in a sawmill processing coniferous wood (pine), in 90 workers employed in two sawmills processing deciduous wood (oak), and in 32 healthy urban dwellers not exposed to  organic dusts (referents). the skin test was performed by the intradermal method  with the saline extracts of wood dust and of the cultures of three microbial species (rahnella sp., brevibacterium linens and penicillium citrinum) isolated from the air polluted with wood dust. sawdust from pine was used for testing of the pine processing workers and referents while sawdust from oak was used for testing of the oak processing workers. skin reactions were recorded after 20 minutes, 8 hours and 24 hours. the agar-gel test for the presence of precipitins  in serum was performed with the extract of pine wood dust and extracts of 17 microbial isolates. the workers processing pine showed a very high frequency of positive skin reactions to the extract of wood dust at all time intervals, significantly greater compared to the workers processing oak and referents (p < 0.001). the early skin reactions to the extracts of dust-borne bacteria and fungi were very common among sawmills workers and showed a significant relationship with the degree of exposure. the frequency of reactions to gram-negative bacterium rahnella sp. was significantly greater in the pine processing workers than in the oak processing workers and referents (p < 0.001). by contrast, the oak processing workers reacted significantly more frequently to penicillium citrinum, compared to the pine processing workers and referents (p < 0.01). these results conform to the prior study of airborne microflora in which the dominancy  of gram-negative bacteria was stated in the pine processing sawmill while mould fungi were most common in the oak processing sawmills. the antibody response of sawmill workers to work-related antigens was much weaker compared to skin reactions. as many as 41 sawmill workers reported the occurrence of work-related  symptoms. a significant relationship was found between the occurrence of symptoms and frequency of allergic reactions, but only with a limited number of antigens.  the obtained results suggest that early allergic reactions to coniferous wood and to microorganisms associated with wood dust are common among sawmill workers, posing a potential risk of work-related disease in this occupational group.

TI  == evaluation of the role of carnobacterium piscicola in spoilage of vacuum- and modified-atmosphere-packed cold-smoked salmon stored at 5 degrees c.
AB  == the microflora on spoiled cold-smoked salmon often consists of a mixture of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and gram-negative bacteria. to elucidate the role of the different groups, a storage trial was carried out in which nisin and co2 were used for the selective inhibition of the two bacterial groups. the shelf-life of  vacuum-packed cold-smoked salmon, recorded by sensory evaluation, was four weeks  at 5 degrees c and the microflora was composed of lab (10(6)-10(7) cfu/g) with an associate gram-negative flora in varying levels (10(5)-10(7) cfu/g). the addition of nisin and/or a co2-atmosphere increased the shelf-life to five or six weeks and limited the level of lab to about 10(4)-10(6), 10(3)-10(6) and 10(2)-10(4) cfu/g, respectively. co2-atmosphere +/- nisin inhibited the growth of gram-negative bacteria, whereas nisin had no effect on these in vacuum packages.  the gram-negative flora on vacuum-packed salmon was dominated by a vibrio sp., resembling v. marinus, enterobacteriaceae (enterobacter agglomerans, serratia liquefaciens and rahnella aquatilis) and occasionally aeromonas hydrophila. irrespective of the addition of nisin and/or co2-atmosphere, the lab microflora was dominated by carnobacterium piscicola, which was found to account for 87% of  the 255 lab isolates characterized. whole-cell-protein patterns analysed by sds-page confirmed the carnobacterium species identification. the spoilage potential of c. piscicola isolates was further studied by inoculation of approx.  10(6) cfu/g in cold-smoked salmon stored at 5 degrees c. the salmon did not spoil within 4 weeks of storage in vacuum- or co2-atmosphere, and it is concluded that  despite high levels (> 10(7) cfu/g) of c. piscicola, sensory rejection was caused by autolytic changes. this was supported by the development of soft texture and sour, rancid and bitter off-flavours at the point of spoilage, irrespective of the length of shelf-life and low or high total counts of lab and gram-negative bacteria.
