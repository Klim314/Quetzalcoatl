TI  == [new findings about vaginal bacterial flora].
AB  == the aim of this review is to update knowledge about the vaginal ecosystem, non-cultivation methods for bacterial identification (gene amplification), the lactobacillus species that comprise normal vaginal flora and influence of host genetics on bacterial interactions with local innate and acquired immune defenses. a medline (pubmed) search from 1997-2009 for relevant articles was performed and the most informative articles were selected. non-culture techniques (gene amplification) allow a comprehensive analysis of the vaginal ecosystem's composition. in the majority of women in the reproductive age there is a predominance of one or more species of lactobacillus: l. crispatus, l. inners and l gasseri. however, in other apparently healthy women there is a deficiency or complete absence of lactobacilli. instead, there is a substitution by other lactic acid-producing bacteria: atobium, megasphaera and/or leptotrichia species. the infectivity and/or proliferation of pathogenic bacteria in the vagina is suppressed by lactic acid production, by products of endogenous bacteria and by activation of local innate and acquired immunity. vaginal epithelial cells produce several compounds with anti-microbial activity. these cells have toll-like receptors on their membrane that recognize molecular patterns associated with pathogens. recognition leads to production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and stimulation of antigen-specific immunity. the production of igg and iga antibodies is also triggered in the endocervix and vagina in response to infection. vaginal flora composition and the immune mechanisms constitute important defenses. criteria of normal and abnormal flora have to be reviewed and genetic polymorphism can explain variations in flora composition. this new knowledge should be included in the clinical practice of gynecologists and obstetricians to improve patients care.

TI  == characterization of vaginal microbial communities in adult healthy women using cultivation-independent methods.
AB  == the normal microbial flora of the vagina plays an important role in preventing genital and urinary tract infections in women. thus an accurate understanding of  the composition and ecology of the ecosystem is important to understanding the aetiology of these diseases. common wisdom is that lactobacilli dominate the normal vaginal microflora of post-pubertal women. however, this conclusion is based on methods that require cultivation of microbial populations; an approach that is known to yield a biased and incomplete assessment of microbial community  structure. in this study cultivation-independent methods were used to analyse samples collected from the mid-vagina of five normal healthy caucasian women between the ages of 28 and 44. total microbial community dna was isolated following resuspension of microbial cells from vaginal swabs. to identify the constituent numerically dominant populations in each community 16s rrna gene libraries were prepared following pcr amplification using the 8f and 926r primers. from each library, the dna sequences of approximately 200 16s rrna clones were determined and subjected to phylogenetic analyses. the diversity and  kinds of organisms that comprise the vaginal microbial community varied among women. species of lactobacillus appeared to dominate the communities in four of the five women. however, the community of one woman was dominated by atopobium sp., whereas a second woman had appreciable numbers of megasphaera sp., atopobium sp. and leptotrichia sp., none of which have previously been shown to be common members of the vaginal ecosystem. of the women whose communities were dominated by lactobacilli, there were two distinct clusters, each of which consisted of a single species. one class consisted of two women with genetically divergent clones that were related to lactobacillus crispatus, whereas the second group of  two women had clones of lactobacillus iners that were highly related to a single  phylotype. these surprising results suggest that culture-independent methods can  provide new insights into the diversity of bacterial species found in the human vagina, and this information could prove to be pivotal in understanding risk factors for various infectious diseases.
