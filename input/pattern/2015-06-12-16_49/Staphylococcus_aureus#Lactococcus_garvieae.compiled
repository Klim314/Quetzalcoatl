TI  - Microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of May bryndza cheese.
AB  - Diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of May bryndza cheese, a traditional Slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. Quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and Geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. Diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese, lactobacilli, lactococci and Geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) CFU/g, 10(9) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. The diversity of bacteria encompassed Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Acinetobacter sp., Acinetobacter johnsonii, Citrobacter braakii, Clostridium bartlettii, Corynebacterium callunae, Corynebacterium maris, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus pallens, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Hafnia alvei, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "Leuconostoc garlicum", Mannheimia glucosida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas sp., Ps. fluorescens, "Ps. reactans", Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, "Rothia arfidiae", Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. felis, Staph. pasteuri, Staph. sciuri, Staph. xylosus, Streptococcus parauberis, Str. thermophilus and Variovorax paradoxus. The diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed Alternaria alternata, "Ascomycete sp.", Aspergillus fumigatus, Beauveria brongniartii, Candida xylopsoci, C. inconspicua, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Debaromyces hansenii, Fomes fomentarius, Galactomyces candidus, Gymnoascus reesii, Chaetomium globosum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Metarhizium anisopliae, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, P. camemberti, P. freii, P. polonicum, P. viridicatum, Pichia kudriavzevii, Sordaria alcina, Trichosporon lactis and Yarrowia lipolytica.
TI  - Chemical synthesis of bacterial lipoteichoic acids: an insight on its biological  significance.
AB  - During infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria, lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin) has a dominant role leading to fulminant pro-inflammatory reactions in the host. As there is no LPS in Gram-positive bacteria, other microbial cell wall components have been identified to be the causative agent for the pro-inflammatory activity since also Gram-positive bacterial infections lead to comparable clinical symptoms and reactions. On search for the "Gram-positive endotoxin" a widely accepted hypothesis has been raised in that the lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) serve as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) during Gram-positive sepsis, although the amount necessary for a pro-inflammatory in vitro response is several orders of magnitude higher than that for LPS. Therefore, LTA cannot be considered to be "the (endo)toxin of Gram-positive bacteria". Although LPS and LTA show structural relatedness (amphiphilic, negatively charged glycophospholipids), they are structurally quite different from each other and one might expect that they are also recognized by different receptors of the innate immune system, the so called toll-like receptors 4 and 2 (TLR4 and TLR2), respectively. Based on their chemical structure, the LTAs were classified into four types (type I-IV) of which we have carefully investigated the LTA of Staphylococcus aureus (type I), Lactococcus garvieae (type II) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (type IV). Hence, these LTAs have been synthesized in our group and biologically evaluated with respect to their potency to activate cytokines in transiently TLR2/CD14-transfected human endothelial kidney cells (HEK 293) or human macrophages and whole blood cells. Although LTA of type I and IV are structurally quite different, especially in their hydrophilic moiety, they originally were believed to interact with the same receptor (TLR2). Hence, the chemical syntheses leading to structurally defined, non-contaminated stimuli have a major impact on the outcome and interpretation of these biological studies of the innate immune system. With this material, it became evident that synthetic LTA from S. aureus and S. pneumoniae are not recognized by TLR2. Instead, another receptor of the innate immune system, the lectin pathway of the complement, known since many years to interact with LTA in quite a specific way, has gained increasing attractivity. With the help of synthetic LTA we obtained first evidences that this receptor is indeed the pathogen recognition receptor (PRR) for LTA.
TI  - Contribution of hydrogen peroxide to the inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus by Lactococcus garvieae in interaction with raw milk microbial community.
AB  - The response of Staphylococcus aureus growth inhibition by Lactococcus garvieae to catalase and milk lactoperoxidase, and its efficiency in raw milk cheese were evaluated. S. aureus and L. garvieae were co-cultivated in broth buffered at pH 6.8, and in raw, pasteurized and microfiltered milk, in presence and absence of catalase. Although H2O2 production by L. garvieae was detected only in agitated broth, the inhibition of S. aureus by L. garvieae was reduced by catalase both in static and shaking cultures by 2.7 log, pasteurized milk (approximately 0.7 log), microfiltered milk (approximately 0.6 log) and raw milk (approximately 0.2 log). The growth of S. aureus alone in microfiltered milk was delayed compared with that in pasteurized milk and inhibition of S. aureus by L. garvieae was stronger in microfiltered milk. The inhibition of coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS) by L. garvieae in raw milk cheese was similar to that in raw milk (approximately 0.8 log), but weaker than that in pasteurized and microfiltered milks. L. garvieae also had an early antagonistic effect on the growth of several other microbial groups, which lastingly affected populations levels and balance during cheese ripening.
TI  - Effect of Lactococcus garvieae, Lactococcus lactis and Enterococcus faecalis on the behaviour of Staphylococcus aureus in microfiltered milk.
AB  - The effect of four strains of Lactococcus garvieae, three strains of Lactococcus  lactis and one strain of Enterococcus faecalis on Staphylococcus aureus SA15 growth in microfiltered milk was evaluated. Lactococcus and Enterococcus strains were co-cultured with S. aureus in microfiltered milk and in medium buffered at pH 6.8. All Lactococcus and Enterococcus strains were able to inhibit S. aureus growth after 6h of incubation. Inhibition by L. lactis and E. faecalis strains could be partially attributed to the decrease in pH below 6.0 as it has been observed in medium buffered at pH 6.8. L. garvieae strains were the most effective to inhibit S. aureus growth without acidification. Inhibition of S. aureus could not be attributed neither to production of lactate, acetate or nor to antistaphylococcal substance. Amino acids competition was not involved in the inhibition by L. garvieae as addition of valine, isoleucine, threonine, methionine and phenylalanine did not suppress the inhibition of S. aureus.
TI  - Effect of temperature and pH on growth of Staphylococcus aureus in co-culture with Lactococcus garvieae.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus growth and enterotoxin production in co-culture with Lactococcus garvieae were studied in laboratory medium as a function of incubation temperature and pH values. Doehlert experimental design was used to study the effect of L. garvieae concentration, temperature, and pH on S. aureus growth in laboratory medium. The mathematical model obtained was validated in cheeses. The inhibition of S. aureus growth by L. garvieae was more important during the first 6 hours of incubation, and its effect increased when its concentration increased. After 24 and 48 hours, the effect of L. garvieae decreased, and the growth of S. aureus was positively influenced by higher temperature and pH values. Staphylococcal enterotoxins were detected in only one experimental set after 48 hours of incubation at 30 degrees C at pH 6.8. Our results argue in favor of adding antagonist strain early in the cheese-making process.
TI  - Identification and antagonistic activity of lactic acid bacteria occurring in porcine blood from industrial slaughterhouses--a preliminary study.
AB  - Ninety-seven lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from slaughterhouse porcine blood in order to select autochthonous LAB strains for use as biopreservatives of this by-product. They were identified by 16S rDNA sequencing; and their inhibition capacity was determined against four bacterial species frequently found in contaminated blood, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Bacillus spp. The taxonomic study showed an unexpected low diversity of LAB in blood, i.e. only 8 different species were found, from which just 4, i.e. Enterococcus raffinosus, Lactobacillus murinus, Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactococcus garvieae, amounted to more than 90% of all isolates. Inhibition tests in solid culture media proved that S. aureus and Bacillus spp. were inhibited by most LAB strains obtained from porcine blood. E. coli was the indicator less affected by the isolated LAB species. Several isolates efficiently inhibited the growth of all tested indicators.
TI  - Molecular analysis of lipid macroamphiphiles by hydrophobic interaction chromatography, exemplified with lipoteichoic acids.
AB  - Analyzed were (I) the oligoglucosyl-, alanyl-substituted poly(glycerophosphate) lipoteichoic acid of Enterococcus hirae containing Glc(alpha 1-2)Glc(alpha 1-3)acyl2-Gro and a phosphatidyl derivative thereof as lipid anchor, (II) the poly(digalactosyl, galactosylglycerophosphate) lipoteichoic acid of Lactococcus garvieae containing the same glycolipid and an acyl derivative of it, and (III) the N-acetylglucosaminyl-, alanyl-substituted poly(glycerophosphate)lipoteichoic acid of Staphylococcus aureus with Glc(beta 1-6)Glc(beta 1-3)acyl2Gro as the sole lipid moiety. Hydrophobic interaction chromatography on octyl-Sepharose separated lipoteichoic acids I and II into two peaks according to the number of fatty acids. Within each peak further fractionation occurred in the order of decreasing length of the hydrophilic chain. A similar fractionation was observed within the single peak of lipoteichoic acid III. With lipoteichoic acid I and III the extent of glycosylation decreased with decreasing length of the hydrophilic chain whereas the content of alanine ester remained either constant or increased. Variations in the oligosaccharide pattern of lipoteichoic acid I and in the fatty acid composition of all lipoteichoic acids could also be observed. Collectively, the data provide for the first time a detailed picture of the complex polydispersity of lipoteichoic acids comprising the number of fatty acids, the length of the hydrophilic chain, the kind and extent of chain substitution, and the fatty acid composition. The procedure will also be applicable to the molecular analysis of lipopolysaccharides and bacterial lipoglycans. Moreover, the results are of physicochemical interest because they demonstrate for lipid macroamphiphiles an inverse relationship between hydrophobicity and the size of the hydrophilic headgroup.
