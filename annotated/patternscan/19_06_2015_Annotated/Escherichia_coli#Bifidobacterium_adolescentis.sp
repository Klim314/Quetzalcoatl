TI  == intestinal microbiota and allergic diseases: a systematic review.
AB  == evidence suggests that possible imbalances in intestinal microbiota composition may be implicated in the occurrence of allergic diseases. although several studies published until 2006 indicated a correlation between microbiota composition and allergic symptoms, it has not been possible to distinguish protective microorganisms from those associated with increased risk of allergic diseases. therefore, the objective of this study was to review the studies published since 2007 that address the intestinal microbiota in allergic diseases. twenty-one studies were identified after excluding those that performed a clinical intervention before stool collection. in the early microbiota of children who later developed allergies, lower bacterial diversity was observed, with a predominance of firmicutes; a higher count of bacteroidaceae; a higher prevalence of the anaerobic bacteria bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum, and  bifidobacterium longum; and a lower prevalence of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, and lactobacillus. in the microbiota of allergic children whose intestinal microbiota was assessed at the onset of allergic symptoms, there was a higher count of bacteroides; a lower count of akkermansia muciniphila, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and clostridium; a higher prevalence of b. adolescentis; a lower prevalence of b. catenulatum and staphylococcus aureus; and a lower bacterial diversity.

TI  == predicting fecal sources in waters with diverse pollution loads using general and molecular host-specific indicators and applying machine learning methods.
AB  == in this study we use a machine learning software (ichnaea) to generate predictive models for water samples with different concentrations of fecal contamination (point source, moderate and low). we applied several mst methods (host-specific bacteroides phages, mitochondrial dna genetic markers, bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium dentium markers, and bifidobacterial host-specific qpcr), and general indicators (escherichia coli, enterococci and somatic coliphages) to evaluate the source of contamination in the samples. the results provided data to the ichnaea software, that evaluated the performance of  each method in the different scenarios and determined the source of the contamination. almost all mst methods in this study determined correctly the origin of fecal contamination at point source and in moderate concentration samples. when the dilution of the fecal pollution increased (below 3 log10 cfu e. coli/100 ml) some of these indicators (bifidobacterial host-specific qpcr, some mitochondrial markers or b. dentium marker) were not suitable because their concentrations decreased below the detection limit. using the data from source point samples, the software ichnaea produced models for waters with low levels of fecal pollution. these models included some mst methods, on the basis of their best performance, that were used to determine the source of pollution in this area. regardless the methods selected, that could vary depending on the scenario, inductive machine learning methods are a promising tool in mst studies and may represent a leap forward in solving mst cases.

TI  == bifidobacterium breve mcc-117 induces tolerance in porcine intestinal epithelial  cells: study of the mechanisms involved in the immunoregulatory effect.
AB  == bifidobacterium breve mcc-117 is able to significantly reduce the expression of inflammatory cytokines in porcine intestinal epithelial (pie) cells and to improve il-10 levels in cd4(+)cd25(high) foxp3(+) lymphocytes in response to heat-stable enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) pathogen-associated molecular patterns (pamps), while the immunoregulatory effect of b. adolescentis atcc15705  was significantly lower than that observed for the mcc-117 strain. considering the different capacities of the two bifidobacterium strains to activate toll-like receptor (tlr)-2 and their differential immunoregulatory activities in pie and immune cells, we hypothesized that comparative studies with both strains could provide important information regarding the molecular mechanism(s) involved in the anti-inflammatory activity of bifidobacteria. in this work, we demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory effect of b. breve mcc-117 was achieved by a complex interaction of multiple negative regulators of tlrs as well as inhibition of multiple signaling pathways. we showed that b. breve mcc-117 reduced heat-stable  etec pamp-induced nf-kappab, p38 mapk and pi3 k activation and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in pie cells. in addition, we demonstrated that b. breve mcc-117 may activate tlr2 synergistically and cooperatively with one or more other pattern recognition receptors (prrs), and that interactions may result in a coordinated sum of signals that induce the upregulation of a20, bcl-3, tollip and sigirr. upregulation of these negative regulators could have an important physiological impact on maintaining or reestablishing homeostatic tlr signals in pie cells. therefore, in the present study, we gained insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in the immunoregulatory effect of b. breve mcc-117.

TI  == use of accuracy profile procedure to validate a real-time pcr method to quantify  bacteria in feces.
AB  == this study describes a novel validation procedure of real-time pcr based on accuracy profile to estimate bacterial concentrations in fecal samples. to assess the performance of the method, measurements of axenic fecal samples spiked with a measured quantity of known bacterial species (bacteroides fragilis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, enterococcus faecium, and escherichia coli) were performed under repeatability and intermediate precision conditions. data collected were used to compute a tolerance interval that was compared to a defined acceptance interval. it is concluded that the method is valid and relevant for the studied validation range of 8.20-10.24 and 7.43-9.47 log10 cfu/g of feces to ensure proper measurement of b. fragilis and e. coli, respectively. the loq is 8.20 and 7.43 log10 cfu/g of feces. in contrast, the method is not valid for the quantification of e. faecium and b. adolescentis, but by applying a correction factor of +0.63 log10 cfu/g, it can be considered valid for e. faecium. this correction is included in the final results. in conclusion, the accuracy profile is a statistical tool that is easy to use and totally adapted to validate real-time pcr.

TI  == graphene oxide as an anaerobic membrane scaffold for the enhancement of b. adolescentis proliferation and antagonistic effects against pathogens e. coli and s. aureus.
AB  == the impact of the gut microbiota on human health is widely perceived as the most  exciting advancement in biomedicine. the gut microbiota has been known to play a  crucial role in defining states of human health and diseases, and thus becomes a  potential new territory for drug targeting. herein, graphene oxide (go) interaction with five common human gut bacteria, b. adolescentis, l. acidophilus, e. coli, e. faecalis, and s. aureus, was studied. it was shown that, in bacterial media, go sheets were able to form effective, anaerobic membrane scaffolds that enhanced the antagonistic activity of b. adolescentis against the pathogens e. coli ands. aureus. data obtained using bacterial growth measurements, colony counting and 16s rrna gene sequencing consistently indicated that go sheets promoted proliferation of gut bacteria, particularly for b. adolescentis. scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy images, and membrane potential measurements showed that cell membranes maintained their integrity and  that no observable variations in cell morphology were induced after interaction with go sheets, indicating good biocompatibility of go. these results suggest the possibility of using go sheets as efficient drug carriers in therapeutic applications to treat diseases related to the gut microbiota.

TI  == isolation and characterization of an agaro-oligosaccharide (ao)-hydrolyzing bacterium from the gut microflora of chinese individuals.
AB  == agarose (ap) from red algae has a long history as food ingredients in east asia.  agaro-oligosaccharides (ao) derived from ap have shown potential prebiotic effects. however, the human gut microbes responsible for the degradation of ao and ap have not yet been fully investigated. here, we reported that ao and ap can be degraded and utilized at various rates by fecal microbiota obtained from different individuals. bacteroides uniformis l8 isolated from human feces showed  a pronounced ability to degrade ao and generate d-galactose as its final end product. pcr-dgge analysis showed b. uniformis to be common in the fecal samples, but only b. uniformis l8 had the ability to degrade ao. a synergistic strain, here classified as escherichia coli b2, was also identified because it could utilize the d-galactose as the growth substrate. the cross-feeding interaction between b. uniformis l8 and e. coli b2 led to exhaustion of the ao supply. bifidobacterium infantis and bifidobacterium adolescentis can utilize one of the  intermediates of ao hydrolysis, agarotriose. growth curves indicated that ao was  the substrate that most favorably sustained the growth of b. uniformis l8. in contrast, kappa-carrageenan oligosaccharides (kco), guluronic acid oligosaccharides (go), and mannuronic acid oligosaccharides (mo) were found to be unusable to b. uniformis l8. current results indicate that b. uniformis l8 is a special degrader of ao in the gut microbiota. because b. uniformis can mitigate high-fat-diet-induced metabolic disorders, further study is required to determine the potential applications of ao.

TI  == [effects of lamivudine on growth of intestinal characteristic bacteria by microcalorimetry in vitro].
AB  == the study is aimed to investigate the effect of lamivudine on growth and metabolism of three intestinal characteristic bacteria (namely, bifidobacterium adolescentis, escherichia coli and shigella dysenteriae). the growth condition of the three bacteria was quantitatively evaluated by microcalorimetry with four characteristic parameters of the thermal power-time curves, including the growth  rate constant (k), thermal power (p), time to peak (t) and calorific value (q). the results showed that the ic50 value of lamivudine on b. adolescentis was 200 microg x ml(-1), and the ic50 values of lamivudine on s. dysenteriae and e. coli  were higher than 3 000 microg x ml(-1) and 6 000 microg x ml(1), respectively. therefore, lamivudine made different inhibitory effects on the three bacteria, in which the b. adolescentis was most susceptible to lamivudine. this work showed that taking lamivudine chronically is likely to affect the balance of good flora  in the intestinal tract, and might increase endotoxin release, leading to inflammation and disease progression in hepatopathy.

TI  == neutralization of the antimicrobial effect of glyphosate by humic acid in vitro.
AB  == in the present study, the neutralization ability of the antimicrobial effect of glyphosate by different humic acids was investigated. the minimal inhibitory concentrations of glyphosate for different bacteria such as bacillus badius, bifidobacterium adolescentis, escherichia coli, e. coli 1917 strain nissle, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, salmonella enteritidis and salmonella typhimurium were determined in the presence or absence of different concentrations of humic acid (0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg ml(-1)). our findings indicated that humic acids inhibited the antimicrobial effect of glyphosate on different bacteria. this information can help overcome the negative impact of glyphosate residues in feed and water.

TI  == sunlight inactivation of human polymerase chain reaction markers and cultured fecal indicators in river and saline waters.
AB  == decay rates for sunlight inactivation of polymerase chain reaction (pcr) markers  for total bacteroidales, human-specific bacteroidales, escherichia coli, and bifidobacterium adolescentis relative to cultured e. coli were investigated. the  experiment used 100-l chambers of fresh water and seawater (paired with dark controls) seeded with human sewage and exposed to natural sunlight over three summer days. culturable e. coli levels in sunlight-exposed chambers decreased by  at least 3 logs on day 1, and by day 3 a total reduction of 4.5 to 5.5 logs was achieved in fresh water and seawater, respectively. in contrast, pcr detection of the four gene targets in sunlight-exposed chambers reduced by no more than 2 logs over the duration of the study (k(t) < 0.071 log(e) units h(-1)). under these experimental conditions, pcr markers are considerably more conservative than culturable e. coli and can persist for extended periods of time following inactivation of e. coli.

TI  == xylooligosaccharides from hardwood and cereal xylans produced by a thermostable xylanase as carbon sources for lactobacillus brevis and bifidobacterium adolescentis.
AB  == to compare xylans from forestry with agricultural origins, hardwood xylan (birch) and cereal arabinoxylan (rye) were hydrolyzed using two variants of the xylanase  rmxyn10a, full-length enzyme and catalytic module only, from rhodothermus marinus . cultivations of four selected bacterial species, using the xylooligosaccharide  (xos) containing hydrolysates as carbon source, showed selective growth of lactobacillus brevis dsmz 1264 and bifidobacterium adolescentis atcc 15703. both  strains were confirmed to utilize the xos fraction (dp 2-5), whereas putative arabinoxylooligosaccharides from the rye arabinoxylan hydrolysate were utilized by only b. adolescentis. escherichia coli did not grow, despite its capability to grow on the monosaccharides arabinose and xylose. it was also shown that pediococcus parvulus strain 2.6 utilized neither xylose nor xos for growth. in summary, rmxyn10a or its catalytic module proved suitable for high-temperature hydrolysis of hardwood xylan and cereal arabinoxylan, producing xos that could qualify as prebiotics for use in functional food products.

TI  == expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary x-ray diffraction analysis of bifidobacterium adolescentis xylose isomerase.
AB  == xylose isomerase (ec 5.3.1.5) is a key enzyme in xylose metabolism which is industrially important for the transformation of glucose and xylose into fructose and xylulose, respectively. the bifidobacterium adolescentis xyla gene (nc_008618.1) encoding xylose isomerase (xi) was cloned and the enzyme was overexpressed in escherichia coli. purified recombinant xi was crystallized using the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method with polyethylene glycol 3350 as the precipitating agent. a complete native data set was collected to 1.7 a resolution using a synchrotron-radiation source. the crystals belonged to the orthorhombic space group p21212, with unit-cell parameters a = 88.78, b = 123.98, c = 78.63 a.

TI  == broad-spectrum antibacterial activity of carbon nanotubes to human gut bacteria.
AB  == carbon nanotubes (cnts) hold promise in manufacturing, environmental, and biomedical applications, as well as food and agricultural industries. previous observations have shown that cnts have antimicrobial activity; however, the impact of cnts to human gut microbes has not been investigated. here, the antibacterial activity of cnts against the microbes commonly encountered in the human digestion system--l. acidophilus, b. adolescentis, e. coli, e. faecalis, and s. aureus--are evaluated. the bacteria studied include pathogenic and non-pathogenic, gram-positive and negative, and both sphere and rod strains. in this study, cnts, including single-walled cnts (swcnts, 1-3 mum), short and long  multi-walled cnts (s-mwcnts: 0.5-2 mum; l-mwcnts: >50 mum), and functionalized multi-walled cnts (hydroxyl- and carboxyl-modification, 0.5-2 mum), all have broad-spectrum antibacterial effects. notably, cnts may selectively lyse the walls and membranes of human gut microbes, depending on not only the length and surface functional groups of cnts, but also the shapes of the bacteria. the mechanism of antibacterial activity is associated with their diameter-dependent piercing and length-dependent wrapping on the lysis of microbial walls and membranes, inducing release of intracellular components dna and rna and allowing  a loss of bacterial membrane potential, demonstrating complete destruction of bacteria. thin and rigid swcnt show more effective wall/membrane piercing on spherical bacteria than mwcnts. long mwcnt may wrap around gut bacteria, increasing the area making contact with the bacterial wall. this work suggests that cnts may be broad-spectrum and efficient antibacterial agents in the gut, and selective application of cnts could reduce the potential hazard to probiotic  bacteria.

TI  == effects of antibiotics on bacterial species composition and metabolic activities  in chemostats containing defined populations of human gut microorganisms.
AB  == the composition and metabolic activities of the human colonic microbiota are modulated by a number of external factors, including diet and antibiotic therapy. changes in the structure and metabolism of the gut microbiota may have long-term  consequences for host health. the large intestine harbors a complex microbial ecosystem comprising several hundreds of different bacterial species, which complicates investigations on intestinal physiology and ecology. to facilitate such studies, a highly simplified microbiota consisting of 14 anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic organisms (bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, clostridium butyricum, c. perfringens, c. bifermentans, c. innocuum, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus) was used in this investigation. ampicillin [9.2 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to two chemostats  operated at different dilution rates (d; 0.10 h(-1) and 0.21 h(-1)), and metronidazole [76.9 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to a third vessel (d = 0.21 h(-1)). perturbations in bacterial physiology and metabolism were sampled over a  48-h period. lactobacillus acidophilus and c. bifermentans populations did not establish in the fermentors under the imposed growth conditions. ampicillin resulted in substantial reductions in bacteroides and c. perfringens populations  at both dilution rates. metronidazole strongly affected bacteroides communities but had no effect on bifidobacterial communities. the bacteriostatic effect of ampicillin on bifidobacterial species was growth rate dependent. several metabolic activities were affected by antibiotic addition, including fermentation product formation and enzyme synthesis. the growth of antibiotic-resistant bifidobacteria in the large bowel may enable them to occupy ecological niches left vacant after antibiotic administration, preventing colonization by pathogenic species.

TI  == expression and characterization of a bifidobacterium adolescentis beta-mannanase  carrying mannan-binding and cell association motifs.
AB  == the gene encoding beta-mannanase (ec 3.2.1.78) baman26a from the bacterium bifidobacterium adolescentis (living in the human gut) was cloned and the gene product characterized. the enzyme was found to be modular and to contain a putative signal peptide. it possesses a catalytic module of the glycoside hydrolase family 26, a predicted immunoglobulin-like module, and two putative carbohydrate-binding modules (cbms) of family 23. the enzyme is likely cell attached either by the sortase mechanism (lpxtg motif) or via a c-terminal transmembrane helix. the gene was expressed in escherichia coli without the native signal peptide or the cell anchor. two variants were made: one containing  all four modules, designated baman26a-101k, and one truncated before the cbms, designated baman26a-53k. baman26a-101k, which contains the cbms, showed an affinity to carob galactomannan having a dissociation constant of 0.34 mum (8.8 mg/liter), whereas baman26a-53k did not bind, showing that at least one of the putative cbms of family 23 is mannan binding. for baman26a-53k, k(cat) was determined to be 444 s(-1) and k(m) 21.3 g/liter using carob galactomannan as the substrate at the optimal ph of 5.3. both of the enzyme variants hydrolyzed konjac glucomannan, as well as carob and guar gum galactomannans to a mixture of oligosaccharides. the dominant product from ivory nut mannan was found to be mannotriose. mannobiose and mannotetraose were produced to a lesser extent, as shown by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography. mannobiose was not hydrolyzed, and mannotriose was hydrolyzed at a significantly lower rate than the longer oligosaccharides.

TI  == a novel sucrose phosphorylase from the metagenomes of sucrose-rich environment: isolation and characterization.
AB  == sucrose phosphorylase, an important enzyme mainly involved in the generic starch  and sucrose pathways, has now caught the attention of researchers due to its transglycosylation activity. a novel sucrose phosphorylase, unspase, has been isolated, and its transglycosylation properties were characterized. compared with bisp, the sucrose phosphorylase from bifidobacterium adolescentis, unspase had two deleted regions in its c: -terminal. these deleted regions were probably equivalent to the important five-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet domain in sucrose phosphorylase. unspase has a k(m) of 21.12 mm, a v(max) of 69.24 mumol min(-1) mg(-1) and a k(cat) of 31.19 s(-1) with sucrose as substrate. in 3-(n-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid (mops) buffer, unspase transferred the glycosyl moiety to l-arabinose, d-fructose and l-sorbose. much to our surprise, unspase can catalyze the transglycosylation in which a glycosyl moiety was transferred to l-arabinose in the presence of phosphate, which is an interesting  exception to the generally accepted fact that transglycosylation can only occur under the condition of phosphate absence. the final yield of the transglycosylation product (37.9 %) in phosphate buffer was even higher than that (5.8 %) in mops buffer. this is a novel phenomenon that a sucrose phosphorylase can catalyze a transglycosylation reaction in the presence of phosphate.

TI  == a targeted gene knockout method using a newly constructed temperature-sensitive plasmid mediated homologous recombination in bifidobacterium longum.
AB  == bifidobacteria are the main component of the human microflora. we constructed a temperature-sensitive (ts) plasmid by random mutagenesis of the bifidobacterium-escherichia coli shuttle vector pkkt427 using error-prone pcr. mutant plasmids were introduced into bifidobacterium longum 105-a and, after screening approximately 3,000 colonies, candidate clones that grew at 30 degrees  c but not at 42 degrees c were selected. according to dna sequence analysis of the ts plasmid, five silent and one missense mutations were found in the repb region. the site-directed mutagenesis showed only the missense mutation to be relevant to the ts phenotype. we designated this plasmid pko403. the ts phenotype was also observed in b. longum ncc2705 and bifidobacterium adolescentis atcc15703. single-crossover homologous-recombination experiments were carried out to determine the relationship between the length of homologous sequences encoded  on the plasmid and recombination frequency: fragments greater than 1 kb gave an efficiency of more than 10(3) integrations per cell. we performed gene knockout experiments using this ts plasmid. we obtained gene knockout mutants of the pyre  region of b. longum 105-a, and determined that double-crossover homologous recombination occurred at an efficiency of 1.8 %. this knockout method also worked for the bl0033 gene in b. longum ncc2705.

AB  == beta-d-xylosidase (e.c. 3.2.1.37) from bifidobacterium breve k-110, which hydrolyzes ginsenoside ra1 to ginsenoside rb2, was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the (his6)-tagged recombinant enzyme, designated as xlybk- 110, was efficiently purified using ni(2)(+)-affinity chromatography (109.9-fold, 84%  yield). the molecular mass of xylbk- 100 was found to be 55.7 kda by sds-page. its sequence revealed a 1,347 bp open reading frame (orf) encoding a protein containing 448 amino acids, which showed 82% identity (dna) to the previously reported glycosyl hydrolase family 30 of bifidobacterium adolescentis atcc 15703. the km and vmax values toward p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-xylopyranoside (pnpx) were 1.45mm and 10.75 micromol/min/mg, respectively. this enzyme had ph and temperature optima at 6.0 and 45 degrees c, respectively. xylbk-110 acted to the  greatest extent on xyloglucosyl kakkalide, followed by pnpx and ginsenoside ra1,  but did not act on p-nitrophenyl-alpha-larabinofuranoside, p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside, or p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-fucopyranoside. in  conclusion, this is the first report on the cloning and expression of beta-dxylosidase- hydrolyzing ginsenoside ra1 and kakkalide from human intestinal microflora.

TI  == relative decay of fecal indicator bacteria and human-associated markers: a microcosm study simulating wastewater input into seawater and freshwater.
AB  == fecal contaminations of inland and coastal waters induce risks to human health and economic losses. to improve water management, specific markers have been developed to differentiate between sources of contamination. this study investigates the relative decay of fecal indicator bacteria (fib, escherichia coli and enterococci) and six human-associated markers (two bacterial markers: bacteroidales hf183 (hf183) and bifidobacterium adolescentis (bifad); one viral marker: genogroup ii f-specific rna bacteriophages (frnaph ii); three chemical markers: caffeine and two fecal stanol ratios) in freshwater and seawater microcosms seeded with human wastewater. these experiments were performed in darkness, at 20 degrees c and under aerobic conditions. the modeling of the decay curves allows us (i) to compare fib and markers and (ii) to classify markers according to their persistence in seawater (frnaph ii < hf183, stanol ratios < bifad, caffeine) and in freshwater (hf183, stanol ratios < frnaph ii < bifad < caffeine). although those results depend on the experimental conditions, this study represents a necessary step to develop and validate an interdisciplinary toolbox for the investigation of the sources of fecal contaminations.

TI  == plasmid artificial modification: a novel method for efficient dna transfer into bacteria.
AB  == bacterial transformation is an essential component of many molecular biological techniques, but bacterial restriction-modification (r-m) systems can preclude the efficient introduction of shuttle vector plasmids into target bacterial cells. whole-genome dna sequences have recently been published for a variety of bacteria. using homology and motif analyses, putative r-m genes can be identified from genome sequences. introducing dna methyltransferase genes into escherichia coli cells causes subsequently transformed plasmids to be modified by these enzymes. we propose a new method, designated plasmid artificial modification (pam). a pam plasmid encoding the modification enzymes expressed by the target bacterial host is transformed into e. coli (pam host). propagation of a shuttle vector from the pam host to the target bacterium ensures that the plasmid will be modified such that it is protected from restriction endonuclease digestion in the target bacterium. the result will be a higher transformation efficiency. here, we describe the use of pam and electroporation to transform bifidobacterium adolescentis atcc15703. by introducing two genes encoding modification enzymes, we improved transformation efficiency 10(5)-fold.

TI  == dysbiosis of the faecal microbiota in patients with crohn's disease and their unaffected relatives.
AB  == background and aims: a general dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota has been established in patients with crohn's disease (cd), but a systematic characterisation of this dysbiosis is lacking. therefore the composition of the predominant faecal microbiota of patients with cd was studied in comparison with  the predominant composition in unaffected controls. whether dysbiosis is present  in relatives of patients cd was also examined. methods: focusing on families with at least three members affected with cd, faecal samples of 68 patients with cd, 84 of their unaffected relatives and 55 matched controls were subjected to community fingerprinting of the predominant microbiota using denaturing gradient  gel electrophoresis (dgge). to analyse the dgge profiles, bionumerics software and non-parametric statistical analyses (spss v.17.0) were used. observed differences in the predominant microbiota were subsequently confirmed and quantified with real-time pcr. results: five bacterial species characterised dysbiosis in cd, namely a decrease in dialister invisus (p=0.04), an uncharacterised species of clostridium cluster xiva (p = 0.03), faecalibacterium  prausnitzii (p < 1.3 x 10(-)(5)) and bifidobacterium adolescentis (p = 5.4 x 10(-)(6)), and an increase in ruminococcus gnavus (p = 2.1 x 10(-)(7)). unaffected relatives of patients with cd had less collinsella aerofaciens (p = 0.004) and a member of the escherichia coli-shigella group (p = 0.01) and more ruminococcus torques (p = 0.02) in their predominant microbiota as compared with  healthy subjects. conclusion: unaffected relatives of patients with cd have a different composition of their microbiota compared with healthy controls. this dysbiosis is not characterised by lack of butyrate producing-bacteria as observed in cd but suggests a role for microorganisms with mucin degradation capacity.

TI  == protective effects of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and staphylococci on the infection of cultured ht29 cells with different enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli serotypes are strain-specific.
AB  == in this study, we investigated the interaction of 19 benign strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab), bifidobacteria and staphylococci with enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) strains of different serotypes and virulence gene spectrum in a ht29 cell culture infection model. as markers of infection, the secretion of interleukin 8 (il-8) and the activation of the transcription factor  nf-kappab by the infected cells were determined. with 12 of 19 tested strains, a  weak reduction <30% of il-8 secretion of ht29 cells after co-infection with ehec  o157:h7 strain edl933 was observed. six strains reduced the il-8 secretion up to  60% and the strain b. adolescentis dsmz 20086 decreased the il-8 production about 73%. in further co-infection assays with ehec strains of the serotypes o103:h2, o26:h(-), 0157:h(-) and o113:h21, different abilities of the lab strains to influence the infection with the different ehec strains were noted. therefore, the protective anti-inflammatory effect is strain specific for lab and also depends on the application of ehec strains with different sero- and virulence types. the differences in efficacy of protective bacteria against certain ehec strains were unexpected and have not been shown so far. furthermore, we could show that the inhibitory effects were not attributed to lower adhesion abilities  of ehec to the production of organic acids by the benign bacteria. in addition, viable bacteria are needed to inhibit the il-8 secretion. moreover, the nf-kappab activation was reduced significantly by all tested lab strains in co-infection trials, but was not strain-specific. the model described here is useful to screen for basic effects of protective bacteria that are able to counteract ehec-mediated effects on human cells, and to study the molecular interaction between bacteria as well as between bacteria and human cultured cells.

AB  == the microbiological quality of coastal or river waters can be affected by faecal  pollution from human or animal sources. an efficient mst (microbial source tracking) toolbox consisting of several host-specific markers would therefore be  valuable for identifying the origin of the faecal pollution in the environment and thus for effective resource management and remediation. in this multidisciplinary study, after having tested some mst markers on faecal samples,  we compared a selection of 17 parameters corresponding to chemical (steroid ratios, caffeine, and synthetic compounds), bacterial (host-specific bacteroidales, lactobacillus amylovorus and bifidobacterium adolescentis) and viral (genotypes i-iv of f-specific bacteriophages, frnaph) markers on environmental water samples (n = 33; wastewater, runoff and river waters) with variable escherichia coli concentrations. eleven microbial and chemical parameters were finally chosen for our mst toolbox, based on their specificity for particular pollution sources represented by our samples and their detection in river waters impacted by human or animal pollution; these were: the human-specific chemical compounds caffeine, tcep (tri(2-chloroethyl)phosphate) and benzophenone; the ratios of sitostanol/coprostanol and coprostanol/(coprostanol+24-ethylcopstanol); real-time pcr (polymerase chain reaction) human-specific (hf183 and b. adolescentis), pig-specific (pig-2-bac and l. amylovorus) and ruminant-specific (rum-2-bac) markers; and human frnaph genogroup ii.

TI  == increasing the thermostability of sucrose phosphorylase by multipoint covalent immobilization.
AB  == sucrose phosphorylase from bifidobacterium adolescentis was recombinantly expressed in escherichia coli and purified by use of a his-tag. kinetic characterization of the enzyme revealed an optimal temperature for phosphorolytic activity of 58 degrees c, which is surprisingly high for an enzyme from a mesophilic source. the temperature optimum could be further increased to 65 degrees c by multipoint covalent immobilization on sepabeads ec-hfa. the optimal  immobilization conditions were determined by surface response design. the highest immobilization yield (72%) was achieved in a phosphate buffer of 0.04 mm at ph 7.2, irrespective of the temperature. the immobilized enzyme was able to retain 65% of its activity after 16 h incubation at 60 degrees c. furthermore, immobilization of the enzyme in the presence of its substrate sucrose, increased  this value to 75%. the obtained biocatalyst should, therefore, be useful for application in carbohydrate conversions at high temperatures, as required by the  industry.

TI  == characterization of recombinant beta-fructofuranosidase from bifidobacterium adolescentis g1.
AB  == background: we have previously reported on purification and characterization of beta-fructofuranosidase (beta-ffase) from bifidobacterium adolescentis g1. this enzyme showed high activity of hydrolysis on fructo-oligosaccharides with a low degree of polymerization. recently, genome sequences of b. longum ncc2705 and b.  adolescentis atcc 15703 were determined, and csca gene in the both genome sequences encoding beta-ffase was predicted. here, cloning of csca gene encoding  putative beta-ffase from b. adolescentis g1, its expression in e. coli and properties of the recombinant protein are described. results: using the information of csca gene from bifidobacterium adolescentis atcc 15703, csca gene  from b. adolescentis g1 was cloned and sequenced. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of purified beta-ffase from b. adolescentis g1 was identical to the deduced amino acid sequences of csca gene from b. adolescentis g1. to confirm the translated product of the csca gene, the recombinant protein was expressed in escherichia coli. molecular mass of the purified recombinant enzyme was estimated to be about 66,000 by sds-page and 60,300 by maldi tof-ms. the optimum ph of the  enzyme was 5.7 and the enzyme was stable at ph 5.0-8.6. the thermostability of the enzyme was up to 50 degrees c. the k(m) (mm), vmax (micromol/mg of protein/min), k0 (sec(-1)) and k0/k(m)(mm(-1) sec(-1)) for 1-kestose, neokestose, nystose, fructosylnystose, sucrose and inulin were 1.7, 107, 107.5, 63.2, and 1.7, 142, 142.7, 83.9, and 3.9, 152, 152.8, 39.2, and 2.2, 75, 75.4, 34.3, and 38, 79, 79.4, 2.1, and 25.9, 77, 77.4, 3.0, respectively. the hydrolytic activity was strongly inhibited by agno3, sds, and hgcl2. conclusion: the recombinant enzyme had similar specificity to the native enzyme, high affinity for 1-kestose, and low affinity for sucrose and inulin, although properties of the recombinant enzyme showed slight difference from those of the native one previously described.

TI  == [influence of bifidobacteria on antilysozyme activity of microorganisms and their ability to form biofilms].
AB  == aim: to assess influence of bifidobacteria's exometabolites on expression of antilysozyme activity of microflora and its ability to biofilm formation. materials and methods: six strains of bifidobacteria belonging to b. longum, b. bifidum, and b. adolescentis as well as 42 strains of opportunistic microorganisms belonging to escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, and rhodotorula rubra isolated  by conventional methods during assessment of intestinal microbiocenosis in humans. in order to study the influence of bifidoflora's exometabolites on associative flora, obtained filtrates were mixed with nutrient broth in 1:10 ratio with subsequent introduction of pure culture of opportunistic microorganism. nutritional broth was used instead of filtrates of bifidobacteria  for obtaining the control samples. formation of biofilms was determined on the ability of strains of microorganisms to adhere on the surface of 96-well polystyrene plate, whereas the antilysozyme activity was studied by photometric method. results: performed studies revealed multidirectional but mostly inhibiting effect of bifidobacteria's metabolites on antilysozyme activity of opportunistic microorganisms and their ability to form biofilms. changes of these characteristics was observed both in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria as  well as in yeast fungi and depended from species of bifidobacteria and associative opportunistic microflora. conclusion: obtained data open perspective  for search of control on infectious process on the basis of modification of persistence characteristics of associative pathogens and their ability to form biofilms in host's biotope.

TI  == improvement of bacterial transformation efficiency using plasmid artificial modification.
AB  == we have developed a method to improve the transformation efficiency in genome-sequenced bacteria, using 'plasmid artificial modification' (pam), using the host's own restriction system. in this method, a shuttle vector was pre-methylated in escherichia coli cells, which carry all the putative genes encoding the dna modification enzymes of the target microorganism, before electroporation was performed. in the case of bifidobacterium adolescentis atcc15703 and pkkt427 (3.9 kb e. coli-bifidobacterium shuttle vector), introducing two type ii dna methyltransferase genes lead to an enhancement in the transformation efficiency by five orders of magnitude. this concept was also applicable to a type i restriction system. in the case of lactococcus lactis io-1, by using pam with a putative type i methyltransferase system, hsdms1, the transformation efficiency was improved by a factor of seven over that without pam.

TI  == detection of blastocystis from stool samples using real-time pcr.
AB  == we developed a real-time lc pcr assay to detect a 152 bp sequence in an uncharacterized region of the blastocystis genome. the described assay detected 11 of 11 atcc strains of blastocystis from subtypes 1, 3, and 4. three of three stool samples from oregon and california military personnel that were negative for blastocystis by an ova and parasite test as well as a conventional pcr assay  were positive for blastocystis using our real-time lc pcr assay. diagnosis of blastocystis infections using this sensitive method, including dna extraction and real-time pcr, only requires 3 h. the lower limit of detection for blastocystis in stool using the real-time lc pcr assay was calculated to be 760 cells of blastocystis per 100 mg of stool, an estimated 760 parasites per reaction. the assay did not cross-react with ruminococcus hansenii, anarococcus hydrogenalis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, fusobacterium prausnitzii, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, or lactobacillus acidophilus. because of the ease of use, sensitivity, specificity, and increase in blastocystis infections in the usa we believe this assay has the potential to be useful as a clinical diagnosis tool of blastocystis infection.

TI  == identification of commensal bacterial strains that modulate yersinia enterocolitica and dextran sodium sulfate-induced inflammatory responses: implications for the development of probiotics.
AB  == an increasing body of evidence suggests that probiotic bacteria are effective in  the treatment of enteric infections, although the molecular basis of this activity remains elusive. to identify putative probiotics, we tested commensal bacteria in terms of their toxicity, invasiveness, inhibition of yersinia-induced inflammation in vitro and in vivo, and modulation of dextran sodium sulfate (dss)-induced colitis in mice. the commensal bacteria escherichia coli, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides distasonis, and streptococcus salivarius were screened for adhesion to, invasion of, and toxicity for host epithelial cells (ec), and the strains were tested for their ability to  inhibit y. enterocolitica-induced nf-kappab activation. additionally, b. adolescentis was administered to mice orally infected with y. enterocolitica and  to mice with mucosae impaired by dss treatment. none of the commensal bacteria tested was toxic for or invaded the ec. b. adolescentis, b. distasonis, b. vulgatus, and s. salivarius inhibited the y. enterocolitica-induced nf-kappab activation and interleukin-8 production in ec. in line with these findings, b. adolescentis-fed mice had significantly lower results for mean pathogen burden in the visceral organs, intestinal tumor necrosis factor alpha mrna expression, and  loss of body weight upon oral infection with y. enterocolitica. in addition, the  administration of b. adolescentis decelerated inflammation upon dss treatment in  mice. we suggest that our approach might help to identify new probiotics to be used for the treatment of inflammatory and infectious gastrointestinal disorders.

TI  == mutagenicity of arbutin in mammalian cells after activation by human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == arbutin (hydroquinone-beta-d-glucopyranoside) is present in various food plants.  its aglycone, hydroquinone, is mutagenic and carcinogenic. we investigated whether hydroquinone may be released under conditions encountered in the human gastrointestinal tract. arbutin was stable in artificial gastric juice. fecal slurries from nine human subjects completely converted arbutin (2 mm) into hydroquinone. four of nine representative human intestinal species investigated,  namely eubacterium ramulus, enterococcus casseliflavus, bacteroides distasonis, and bifidobacterium adolescentis, deglycosylated arbutin at rates of 21.08, 16.62, 8.43 and 3.59 nmol x min(-1) x (mg protein)(-1), respectively. in contrast, homogenates from small intestinal mucosa and cytosolic fractions from colon mucosa deglycosylated arbutin at substantially lower rates: 0.50 and 0.09 nmol x min(-1) x (mg protein)(-1), respectively. arbutin, unlike hydroquinone, did not induce gene mutations in chinese hamster v79 cells in the absence of an activating system. however, in the presence of cytosolic fractions from e. ramulus or b. distasonis, arbutin was strongly mutagenic. cytosolic fraction from escherichia coli, showing no arbutin glycosidase activity, was not able to activate arbutin in this model system. the release of the proximate mutagen hydroquinone from arbutin by intestinal bacteria in the immediate vicinity of the colon mucosa may pose a potential risk.

TI  == augmentation of vaccenate production and suppression of vaccenate biohydrogenation in cultures of mixed ruminal microbes.
AB  == to increase ruminal outflow of trans-vaccenic acid (t-va), a new strain of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens (mdt-10) was isolated that has a great ability to hydrogenate linoleic acid (la) to t-va. when strain mdt-10 was added to the batch cultures of mixed ruminal microbes (1% of the total number of viable ruminal bacteria), la conversion to t-va increased greatly; after 3 h, t-va levels were > 4-fold higher than the control. by 10 h, all of the t-va was hydrogenated to stearic acid. however, when a new strain of bifidobacterium adolescentis (hf-11), which has a high capacity for incorporation of t-va, was added in conjunction with mdt-10 (1% of the total number of ruminal bacteria), t-va levels after 10 h  were 6 times higher than with mdt-10 alone. these results suggest that t-va produced by mdt-10 was incorporated into hf-11 cells, resulting in protection of  t-va from t-va-hydrogenating microbes. similar results were obtained in a continuous culture of mixed ruminal microbes in which addition of hf-11 simultaneously with mdt-10 increased the amount of t-va in the effluent 2.5-fold. both mdt-10 and hf-11 appeared to grow readily in the presence of mixed ruminal microbes. sixty-two percent of t-va incorporated by hf-11 was present in the free form, whereas 19, 15, and 3%, respectively, were incorporated into monoacylglycerol, glycerophospholipid, and diacylglycerol fractions. because these lipids can be digested in the small intestine, it is likely that most t-va  in hf-11 cells is absorbed. thus, introduction of mdt-10 and hf-11 simultaneously to the rumen might increase the amount of t-va absorbed and might consequently increase the conversion of t-va to conjugated linoleic acid in tissue.

TI  == effect of ph on an in vitro model of gastric microbiota in enteral nutrition patients.
AB  == patients with dysphagia due to oropharyngeal disease or cerebrovascular accident  require long-term nutritional support via enteral feeding, which often results in microbial overgrowth in the upper gastrointestinal (gi) tract. gastric acid is the primary innate defense mechanism in the stomach and has been assumed to provide an effective barrier to microbial colonization at ph values of <4. to evaluate the efficacy of gastric acid as a barrier to overgrowth, the microbiota  of gastric and duodenal aspirates was assessed by culturing methods. additionally, a fermentor-based model incorporating enteral nutrition tubing of the gastric microbiota of enteral nutrition (en) patients was constructed to assess the effect of ph on the microbiota. results showed that gastric acidity had a relatively small effect on the numbers of microorganisms recovered from intestinal aspirates but did influence microbiota composition. similarly, at ph 3 in the fermentor, a complex microbiota developed in the planktonic phase and in biofilms. the effect of ph on microbiota composition was similar in aspirates and in the fermentors. candidas and lactobacilli were aciduric, while recoveries of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae decreased as ph was reduced, although  both were still present in significant numbers at ph 3. only staphylococcus aureus and bifidobacterium adolescentis persisted at higher ph values both in vitro and in vivo. lactate and acetate were the main organic acids detected in both aspirates and fermentors. these data show that the simulator used in this investigation was capable of modeling the effects of environmental influences on  the upper gi microbiota of en patients and that gastric ph of <4 is not sufficient to prevent microbial overgrowth in these individuals.

TI  == commensal gram-negative bacteria prime human dendritic cells for enhanced il-23 and il-27 expression and enhanced th1 development.
AB  == dendritic cells (dc) are the main orchestrators of specific immune responses. depending on microbial information they encounter in peripheral tissues, they promote the development of th1, th2 or unpolarized th cell responses. in this study we have investigated the immunomodulatory effect of non-pathogenic intestinal gram-negative (escherichia coli, bacteroides vulgatus,veillonella parvula, pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram-positive (bifidobacterium adolescentis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus plantarum and staphylococcus aureus) bacteria on human monocyte-derived dc (modc). none of the gram-positive bacteria  (gpb) primed for th1 or th2 development. in contrast, despite the low levels of il-12 they induce, all gram-negative bacteria (gnb) primed modc for enhanced th1  cell development, which was dependent on il-12 and an additional unidentified cofactor. strikingly, gnb-matured modc expressed elevated levels of p19 and p28 mrna, the critical subunits of il-23 and il-27, respectively, suggesting that the il-12 family members may jointly be responsible for their th1-driving capacity. purified major cell wall components of either gnb or gpb did not yield th cell profiles identical to those obtained with whole bacteria, and could not explain the induction of the il-12 family members nor th1 priming by gnb. importantly, this study gives indications that the expression of the different il-12 family members is dictated by different priming conditions of immature dc.

TI  == pattern of cytokine responses to gram-positive and gram-negative commensal bacteria is profoundly changed when monocytes differentiate into dendritic cells.
AB  == the normal gastrointestinal bacterial flora is crucial for the maturation of acquired immunity via effects on antigen-presenting cells (apcs). here we investigated how two types of apcs, monocytes and dendritic cells (dcs), react to different bacterial strains typical of the commensal intestinal microflora. purified human monocytes and monocyte-derived dcs were stimulated with uv-inactivated gram-positive (lactobacillus plantarum and bifidobacterium adolescentis) and gram-negative (escherichia coli and veillonella parvula) bacterial strains. monocytes produced higher levels of interleukin 12p70 (il-12p70) and tumor necrosis factor (tnf), as detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, in response to l. plantarum than in response to e. coli and  v. parvula. in contrast, dcs secreted large amounts of il-12p70, tnf, il-6, and il-10 in response to e. coli and v. parvula but were practically unresponsive to  l. plantarum and b. adolescentis. the lack of a response to the gram-positive strains correlated with lower surface expression of toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) on dcs than on monocytes. the surface expression of tlr4 on dcs was undetectable  when it was analyzed by flow cytometry, but blocking this receptor decreased the  tnf production in response to v. parvula, indicating that tlr4 is expressed at a  low density on dcs. gamma interferon increased the expression of tlr4 on dcs and  also potentiated the cytokine response to the gram-negative strains. our results  indicate that when monocytes differentiate into dcs, their ability to respond to  different commensal bacteria dramatically changes, and they become unresponsive to probiotic gram-positive bacteria. these results may have important implications for the abilities of different groups of commensal bacteria to regulate mucosal and systemic immunity.

AB  == clones of a genomic library of bifidobacterium adolescentis were grown in minimal medium with sucrose as sole carbon source. an enzymatic fructose dehydrogenase assay was used to identify sucrose-degrading enzymes. plasmids were isolated from the positive colonies and sequence analysis revealed that two types of insert were present, which only differed with respect to their orientation in the plasmid. an open reading frame of 1,515 nucleotides with high homology for sucrose phosphorylases was detected on these inserts. the gene was designated sucp and encoded a protein of 56,189 da. sucp was heterologously expressed in escherichia coli, purified, and characterized. the molecular mass of sucp was 58  kda, as estimated by sds-page, while 129 kda was found with gel permeation, suggesting that the native enzyme was a dimer. the enzyme showed high activity towards sucrose and a lower extent towards alpha-glucose-1-phosphate. the transglucosylation properties were investigated using a broad range of monomeric  sugars as acceptor substrate for the recombinant enzyme, while alpha-glucose-1-phosphate served as donor. d- and l-arabinose, d- and l-arabitol, and xylitol showed the highest production of transglucosylation products. the investigated disaccharides and trisaccharides were not suitable as acceptors. the structure of the transglucosylation product obtained with d-arabinose as acceptor was elucidated by nmr. the structure of the synthesized non-reducing dimer was alpha-glcp(1-->1)beta-araf.

TI  == intestinal mucosa-associated bacteria modulate rat mast cell reactivity.
AB  == it is well known that in some conditions bacteria of physiological flora of gastrointestinal tract may become pathogenic. each complaint which causes injury  of gastrointestinal wall integrity permits bacteria to penetrate the tissues and  affect the tissue cells. since mast cells represent one of very important and numerous cellular elements of the gastrointestinal tract walls, bacteria can exert the effects on them. therefore, the aim of our study was to examine the influence of four strains of intestinal mucosa-associated bacteria--bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides fragilis, bifidobacterium adolescentis and escherichia coli on the mast cell reactivity. our experiments were performed in vitro on isolated rat peritoneal mast cells and the reactivity of these cells was estimated on the basis of histamine release. we used the suspensions of whole bacteria, killed by heating at 65 degrees c. we have noticed that the magnitude of bacteria-induced histamine release from mast cells was very low (up to 6.0%) when compared with histamine release induced with con a, compound 48/80 and tnf-alpha. however, all studied bacteria changed the reactivity of mast cells in  anaphylactic (with cona) and anaphylactoid (with compound 48/80) reactions. after 40 min preincubation with b. thetaioataomicron, b. fragilis, b. adolescentis or e. coli cona-induced histamine release was diminished up to 25%, 71%, 58% and and 68% of maximal histamine release, respectively. preincubation of rat mast cells with b. thetaioataomicron, b. fragilis, b. adolescentis or e. coli also changed their reactivity in anaphylactoid reaction with compound 48/80 (histamine release was diminished up to 70%, 63%, 63% and 60%, respectively).

TI  == development of a membrane-array method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == a membrane-array method was developed for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples without using the expensive microarray-arrayer and laser-scanner. the 16s rdna sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to nitrocellulose membranes. digoxigenin (dig)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or pure cultured bacteria using two universal primers, and were hybridized to the membrane-array. hybridization signals were read by nbt/bcip color development. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, b. fragilis, b. distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, c. leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, r. bromii, r. callidus, r. albus, bifidobacterium  longum, b. adolescentis, b. infantis, eubacterium biforme, e. aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus,escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the membrane-array method is a reliable technique for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples. the result was also confirmed by  using specific pcr methods for these bacteria.

TI  == innate immune responses of human neonatal cells to bacteria from the normal gastrointestinal flora.
AB  == the hygiene hypothesis postulates that the prevalence of allergy has increased due to decreased microbial stimulation early in life, leading to delayed maturation of the immune system. the aim of this study was to examine the cytokine pattern produced from cord blood mononuclear cells relative to adult cells after stimulation with bacterial strains from the normal flora. mononuclear cells from cord and adult blood samples were stimulated with the following bacteria: bifidobacterium adolescentis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus mitis, corynebacterium minutissimum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides vulgatus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, veillonella parvula, and neisseria sicca. the levels of interleukin 12 (il-12), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-10, and il-6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the tnf-alpha production was also analyzed after blocking cd14, toll-like receptor 2 (tlr-2), and tlr-4 prior to stimulation with bacteria. the levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha were similar in cord and adult cells. gram-positive bacteria induced considerably higher levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha than gram-negative bacteria in both cord and adult cells. the levels of il-6 were significantly higher in newborns than in adults, whereas the levels of  il-10 were similar in newborns and adults. gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria induced similar levels of il-6 and il-10 in cord cells. l. plantarum bound or signaled through cd14, tlr-2, and tlr-4, whereas e. coli acted mainly through cd14 and tlr-4. these results indicate that the innate immune response in newborns to commensal bacteria is strong and also suggest that different bacterial strains may have differential effects on the maturation of the immune system of infants.

AB  == ecological and physiological effects of the sulphate-reducing bacterium (srb) desulfovibrio desulfuricans on other intestinal organisms were investigated in anaerobic chemostats (dilution rate approximately 0.2 h-1). reproducible defined  bacterial communities were used in these experiments, comprising 14 different saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting species: bifidobacterium longum, bif. adolescentis, bif. pseudolongum, bif. infantis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bact. vulgatus, lactobacillus acidophilus, enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, cl. butyricum, cl. innocuum, cl. bifermentans. lactobacillus and cl. bifermentans populations never rose above minimum detection limits (log10 2.0 and 4.0, respectively) under the experimental conditions employed in these studies. inclusion of des. desulfuricans in bacterial cultures (c. log10 8.4 viable cells ml-1) resulted in marked reductions (i.e. greater than 1 log) in planktonic cell population densities of several species, particularly bif. longum, cl. perfringens and bif. pseudolongum. the two bacteroides species were unaffected by des. desulfuricans, while numbers of cl. butyricum increased. extensive wall growth developed in the srb culture, consisting mainly of des. desulfuricans (log10 9.2 viable cells ml-1), bact. thetaiotaomicron and bact. vulgatus, with lesser numbers of facultative anaerobes, cl. perfringens and bif. longum. wall growth was associated with a reduction in planktonic cell mass and increased acid production by the cultures.  chemotaxonomic study of chemostat microbiotas, on the basis of cellular fatty acid methyl ester (fame) analyses, showed the existence of characteristic bacteroides (c15) and bifidobacterial (c18) markers, but desulfovibrio markers (i-c15:0, c16:0, i-c17:1) could be identified. the metabolic activities of saccharolytic organisms were altered in the srb chemostat, including synthesis of a number of hydrolytic enzymes involved in carbohydrate breakdown, such as alpha-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase, together with several mucinolytic enzymes. high concentrations of sulphide (8.2 mmol 1-1) were  detected in the srb chemostat, suggesting that this metabolite may have been inhibitory to some species. saccharolytic organisms growing in the srb fermenter  utilized more starch, but less galactose-containing polymers, which correlated with the observed glycosidase activities. profound differences were also recorded with respect to fermentation product formation in the chemostats, where a major switch to acetate production occurred in the srb culture, with concomitant reductions in propionate, butyrate and lactate, which is an important electron donor for desulfovibrios.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == effect of intestinal bacteria on formation of azoxymethane-induced aberrant crypt foci in the rat colon.
AB  == the effect of intestinal bacteria on formation of azoxymethane (aom)-induced aberrant crypt foci (acf) and dna adducts in the rat colon was investigated. male sprague-dawley rats were administered cultures of lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli and clostridium perfringens for five weeks and given injections of aom at 15 mg/kg body weight at the first and second weeks. the number of acf five weeks after the start of the experiment was decreased in the rats treated with the cultures or culture supernatants of l. acidophilus and c. perfringens. the half-life of o6-methylguanine (o6-meg) in the l. acidophilus group was shorter than that in the gam broth group. the half-life of 7-methylguanine did not differ among the groups. these results suggest that the metabolite(s) of l. acidophilus and c. perfringens inhibit(s) the acf formation in rats treated with aom and that the inhibitory effect of l. acidophilus is due to the enhanced removal of o6-meg from the colon mucosal dna.

TI  == pcr detection and quantitation of predominant anaerobic bacteria in human and animal fecal samples.
AB  == pcr procedures based on 16s rrna gene sequences specific for 12 anaerobic bacteria that predominate in the human intestinal tract were developed and used for quantitative detection of these species in human (adult and baby) feces and animal (rat, mouse, cat, dog, monkey, and rabbit) feces. fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, and clostridium clostridiiforme had high pcr titers (the maximum dilutions for positive pcr results ranged from 10(-3) to 10(-8)) in all of the human and animal fecal samples tested. bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, and eubacterium limosum also  showed higher pcr titers (10(-2) to 10(-6)) in adult human feces. the other bacteria tested, including escherichia coli, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, eubacterium biforme, and bacteroides distasonis, were either at low pcr titers (less than 10(-2)) or not detected by pcr. the reported pcr procedure including the fecal sample preparation method is simplified and rapid and eliminates the dna isolation steps.

TI  == role of intestinal bacteria in ileal ulcer formation in rats treated with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug.
AB  == the role of intestinal bacteria in induction and repression of ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with one of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids), 5-bromo-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl) thiophene (bfmet), was examined in this study. bfmet was administered by intragastric gavage once at doses of 500-1,500 mg/kg of body weight to wistar rats treated with and without antibiotics (bacitracin, neomycin, streptomycin), germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats, and 72 hr later their gastrointestinal tracts were examined for ulcer formation. a single oral administration of bfmet induced ileal ulcers in specific pathogen-free rats. however, the rats given antibiotics to reduce the intestinal bacteria had no ulcers. bfmet-treated germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with bifidobacterium adolescentis or lactobacillus acidophilus also had no intestinal ulcers. however, the drug induced ileal ulcers in gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with eubacterium limosum or escherichia coli. an overnight culture of b. adolescentis or l. acidophilus or yogurt containing bifidobacterium breve and streptococcus thermophilus, when given as drinking water, inhibited ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with bfmet. gram staining of the ileal contents of normal rats revealed that 97.4% of the stained  microorganisms were gram-positive rods and only 1.2% were gram-negative rods. in  the group of rats with ulcers induced by bfmet, the gram-positive rods decreased  by 56.4% and the gram-negative rods including escherichia coli, klebsiella, proteus and bacteroides increased by 37.3%. however, in the group of rats administered the bifidobacterium culture, the lactobacillus culture or yogurt, the percentages of the gram-negative rods were decreased. although lactobacillus  was a major bacterium in the ileum of normal rats, the gram-negative facultatively anaerobic rods e.coli, klebsiella and proteus were increased in the ulcerated ileum of rats treated with bfmet, suggesting that these bacteria are associated with ulcer formation in rats treated with nsaids, and that lactobacillus and bifidobacterium inhibit it by repressing the growth of ulcer-inducing bacteria.

TI  == purification and characterization of d-xylose isomerase from bifidobacterium adolescentis.
AB  == d-xylose isomerase was purified to homogeneity from cell-free extracts of bifidobacterium adolescentis by ammonium sulfate fractionation and chromatographies on deae-cellulose and butyl-toyopearl. the molecular weight of the purified enzyme was estimated to be 168,000 by gel filtration on tskgel g-3000sw, and 53,000 on sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the optimum ph was around 7 and the enzyme was stable at ph 7-8. the enzyme required bivalent cations, mg2+, co2+, or mn2+ for the activity, particularly mn2+ to be best. the  enzyme had a pi of 4.3, and the km for d-xylose was 4 mm. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme was not similar to those of d-xylose isomerases from  other sources such as clostridium thermosulfurogenes, escherichia coli, or bacillus subtilis.

TI  == [the range of antigenic specificity of bifidobacterium peptidoglycan].
AB  == the antigenic relationships of bifidobacterium bifidum 1 peptidoglycans with different strains of this species (lva-3, 791, go-4), bifidobacteria of other species (b. adolescentis go-13, b. breve 79-38, b. lactentis 79-41, b. longum go-3) and bacteria of remote taxonomic groups (streptococcus faecalis 6-3. staphylococcus aureus com 885, s. epidermidis com 2124. lactobacillus plantarum 1, escherichia coli m-17) were studied on the basis of a highly sensitive test system permitting the registration of normal human antibodies to peptidoglycans.  the level of cross reactions with staphylococci and streptococci correspond to intraspecific and antigenic affinity to l. plantarum and e. coli was considerably less pronounced. copying a number of epitopes of bifidobacteria, s. aureus peptidoglycan seems to possess additional antigenic determinants which participate in the formation of immunological responsiveness in man.

TI  == the role of escherichia coli haemolysin in the pathogenic synergy of colonic bacteria in subcutaneous abscess formation in mice.
AB  == the growth of nine species of colonic bacteria--escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides ovatus, fusobacterium varium, clostridium perfringens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus and bifidobacterium adolescentis--was examined after concomitant injection to form experimental subcutaneous abscesses in mice. injection of a mixture of c. 10(5) cfu of each of the first five strains (e. coli, ent. faecalis, b. ovatis, f. varium and c. perfringens) resulted in abscess formation in all mice tested when  the e. coli strain was haemolytic. e. coli and b. ovatus multiplied and reached a maximum population of c. 10(8) cfu/abscess. when non-haemolytic e. coli was used, injection of greater than or equal to 10(7) cfu was required for abscess formation. the inclusion of partially purified e. coli haemolysin (125 hu50) with c. 10(5) cfu of bacteria including non-haemolytic e. coli resulted in abscess formation in most mice tested. these results indicate that e. coli haemolysin is  one factor that may potentiate pathogenic synergy among colonic bacteria especially between e. coli and b. ovatus, during abscess formation.

AB  == the effects of brown rice, containing fourfold as much dietary fiber as polished  rice, on the human fecal microflora were determined. significantly increased numbers of bifidobacterium adolescentis and enterococcus faecalis were observed during the brown rice intake, whereas the total counts and the numbers of bacteroides, eubacterium aerofaciens, and escherichia coli during the intake were lower than those before and after the intake. lower numbers of clostridia and low incidences of clostridium paraputrificum and c. perfringens were observed during  the brown rice intake.

TI  == survival and enumeration of the fecal indicators bifidobacterium adolescentis and escherichia coli in a tropical rain forest watershed.
AB  == the density of bifidobacterium spp., fecal coliforms, escherichia coli, and total anaerobic bacteria, acridine orange direct counts, percentages of total bacterial community activity and respiration, and 12 physical and chemical parameters were  measured simultaneously at six sites for 12 months in the mameyes river rain forest watershed, puerto rico. the densities of all bacteria were higher than those reported for uncontaminated temperate rivers, even though other water quality parameters would indicate that all uncontaminated sites were oligotrophic. the highest densities for all indicator bacteria were at the site receiving sewage effluent; however, the highest elevation site in the watershed had the next highest densities. correlations between bacterial densities, nitrates, temperature, phosphates, and total phosphorus indicated that all viable counts were related to nutrient levels, regardless of the site sampled. in situ diffusion chamber studies at two different sites indicated that e. coli could survive, remain physiologically active, and regrow at rates that were dependent on nutrient levels of the ambient waters. bifidobacterium adolescentis did not survive at either site but did show different rates of decline and physiological  activity at the two sites. bifidobacteria show promise as a better indicator of recent fecal contamination in tropical freshwaters than e. coli or fecal coliforms; however, the yn-6 medium did not prove to be effective for enumeration of bifidobacteria. the coliform maximum contaminant levels for assessing water usability for drinking and recreation appear to be unworkable in tropical freshwaters.

TI  == [bacteria and dietary fiber].
AB  == the presence of cellulose particles, so in-vitro studies have shown, influences the growth rate and metabolic activity of the bacteria escherichia coli, bifidobacterium adolescentis and chromobacterium violaceum. after the homogenization in waring blendor, the growth rate has been found to be highest in a medium containing 10% cellulose particles and to show a decreasing tendency in  media containing 5%, 1% and 0% cellulose. the biochemical intensity, judged by glucose consumption and intensity of nitrate reduction, showed an inverse tendency. it seems necessary to add also the factor "biochemical activity" of the microorganisms to the effect of dietary fibres in the intestinal tract.

TI  == assessment of bifidobacteria as indicators of human fecal pollution.
AB  == the distribution of bifidobacteria in the environment has been examined by using  yn-6 medium. although feces of humans, chickens, cows, dogs, pigs, horses, cats,  sheep, beavers, goats, and turkeys were examined, bifidobacteria were isolated only from the feces of humans and swine. the frequency and distribution of component species of human fecal isolates were as in isolates from raw sewage. bifidobacterium longum and b. adolescentis were most often isolated and in the highest densities. the levels of bifidobacteria in raw sewage were in the range of 10(6) organisms/100 ml, and the effect of primary and secondary sewage treatment on the number of viable organisms present was not significant. high densities of bifidobacteria were found in all samples from septic tanks. it was found that bifidobacteria did not survive as well as escherichia coli in either fresh or marine waters. the ratio of bifidobacteria to e. coli is an indication of the age and of the effectiveness of treatment of sewage effluent.

TI  == effect of intestinal bacteria on incidence of liver tumors in gnotobiotic c3h/he  male mice.
AB  == the effect of intestinal microflora on liver tumorigenesis was studied in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice monoassociated, diassociated, or polyassociated with the following strains of intestinal bacteria: escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium infantis, clostridium indolis, c. paraputrificum, c. perfringens, c. innocuum, c. nexile, c. ramosum, c. clostridiiforme, bacteroides multiacidus, bacteroides fragilis, veillonella alcalescens, v. parvula, and lactobacillus acidophilus. the incidence of liver tumors was higher in most of the gnotobiotes (67--100%) and conventionalized mice (82%) derived from the germfree mice than in the germfree mice (39%). the average incidence of tumor nodules in gnotobiotes associated with e. coli, s. faecalis, and c. paraputrificum was 2.9, which was significantly higher than that in the conventionalized animals (1.6). in contrast, the average incidence of tumor nodules in gnotobiotes associated with e. coli, s. faecalis, l. acidophilus, c. perfringens, and bacteroides fragilis (0.9) was not significantly different from  that in germfree animals (0.5). the present study demonstrated that the presence  of certain intestinal bacteria is related to liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice.

TI  == experimental shigella infections in laboratory animals. i. antagonism by human normal flora components in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == germfree mice were associated with selected species of human intestinal bacteria  and then challenged with a streptomycin-resistant shigella flexneri strain. antagonism against shigella was most pronounced in mice associated with escherichia coli and least pronounced in mice associated with bacteroides fragilis. a moderate degree of antagonism could be demonstrated in mice associated with either streptococcus faecalis or bifidobacterium adolescentis. shigella persisted in the cecal contents of e. coli-associated mice at very low,  stable levels. shigella populations were reduced to levels below detection in the ceca of mice diassociated with e. coli and bacteroides. upon subsequent administration of streptomycin, bacteroides disappeared from the ceca. the e. coli population was greatly reduced, and shigella reappeared at very high population levels as an apparent recombinant which resembled e. coli biochemically. a streptomycin-resistant e. coli population subsequently emerged and became dominant in the ceca. shigella concomitantly declined to levels below  detection.
