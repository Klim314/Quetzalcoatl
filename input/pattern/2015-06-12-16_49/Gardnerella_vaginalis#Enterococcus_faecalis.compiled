TI  - Performance evaluation of a DNA chip assay in the identification of major genitourinary pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To prevent the recurrence of genitourinary infections and to reduce the risks of their complications, accurate and rapid diagnosis are required. STDetect(R) Chip is a DNA chip which allows for the simultaneous detection of 13 major genitourinary pathogens in a single vaginal swab or urine specimen. We evaluated the analytical performance of the STDetect(R) Chip for detecting target pathogens that commonly cause genitourinary infections. METHODS: The target pathogens of the STDetect(R) Chip are Chlamydia trachomatis, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Performance of the STDetect(R) Chip for the detection of target pathogens was evaluated comparing with the result of direct sequencing and conventional multiplex PCR assay. And precision tests for STDetect(R) Chip were performed with quality control materials. RESULTS: The STDetect(R) Chip showed high sensitivities (95.1%-100%), specificities (93.4% to 100%), concordance rates (95.0%-100%), positive predictive values (69.8%-100%), and negative predictive values (93.1%-100%) in its identification of 13 target pathogens. The STDetect(R) Chip had a particularly excellent concordance rate (96.5%) for the 4 major pathogens, C. albicans, G. vaginalis, M. hominis, and U. urealyticum, compared with direct sequencing. Comparing to multiplex PCR assay, STDetect(R) Chip showed better sensitivity for detecting M. hominis (97.0% vs. 54.5%) and U. urealyticum (93.2% vs. 65.9%). In precision tests, coefficients of variations for signal intensities were ranged from 11.2% to 26.2%. CONCLUSION: The STDetect(R) Chip showed excellent analytical performance, and its result was in good agreement with that obtained by direct sequencing.
TI  - Bacterial infections of the lower genital tract in fertile and infertile women from the southeastern Poland.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to investigate the detection rates of  Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and Enterococcus faecalis, showing no clinical signs of an ongoing, acute inflammatory state of the vagina and/or the cenrvix, in fertile and infertile women. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study encompassed 161 women, including 101 women treated for infertility and 60 fertile women who had already given birth to healthy children. The material for the presence of C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, M. genitalium, M. hominis and U. urealyticum was collected from the cervical canal and analyzed by PCR. Furthermore, BD ProbeTec ET system was used to detect C. trachomatis infection. Vaginal swabs were collected for classification of bacterial vaginosis and aerobic vaginitis and assessed according to the Nugent score, as well as by traditional culture methods. RESULTS: U. urealyticum was identified in 9% of the infertile women and in 8% of controls. Presence of M. hominis was demonstrated only in the former (4%) and C. trachomatis only in latter (3%). N. gonorrhoeae and M. genitalium were not found in any of the examined women. The frequency of aerobic vaginitis in both groups was estimated at 12%. There were 7% bacterial vaginosis cases in the study group, and none in the control group (p=0.0096). CONCLUSIONS: Despite having no symptoms of an ongoing acute inflammation of the reproductive tract, many women may experience permanent or periodic shifts of equilibrium of the vaginal and/or cervical microflora. BV develops more frequently in infertile patients when compared to the fertile women.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis inhibits superantigen toxic shock syndrome toxin-1-induced  interleukin-8 from human vaginal epithelial cells through tetramic acids.
AB  - The vaginal mucosa can be colonized by many bacteria including commensal organisms and potential pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus. Some strains of S. aureus produce the superantigen toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, which can penetrate the vaginal epithelium to cause toxic shock syndrome. We have observed that a female was mono-colonized with Enterococcus faecalis vaginally as tested in aerobic culture, even upon repeated culture for six months, suggesting this organism was negatively influencing colonization by other bacteria. In recent studies, we demonstrated an "outside-in" mechanism of cytokine signaling and consequent inflammation that facilitates the ability of potential pathogens to initiate infection from mucosal surfaces. Thus, we hypothesized that this strain of E. faecalis may make anti-inflammatory factors which block disease progression of more pathogenic organisms. E. faecalis MN1 inhibited interleukin-8 production from human vaginal epithelial cells in response to the vaginal pathogens Candida albicans, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, as well as to toxic shock syndrome toxin-1. We further demonstrated that this organism secretes two tetramic acid compounds which appear responsible for inhibition of interleukin-8 production, as well as inhibition of T cell proliferation due to toxic shock syndrome toxin-1. Microbicides that include anti-inflammatory molecules, such as these tetramic acid compounds naturally produced by E. faecalis MN1, may be useful in prevention of diseases that develop from vaginal infections.
TI  - Microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina in male-to-female transsexuals is a recently created microbial niche which thus far has been characterized only to a very limited extent. Yet the knowledge of this microflora can be considered as essential to the follow-up of transsexual women. The primary objective of this study was to map the neo-vaginal microflora in a group of 50 transsexual women for whom a neovagina was constructed by means of the inverted penile skin flap technique. Secondary objectives were to describe possible correlations of this microflora with multiple patients' characteristics, such as sexual orientation, the incidence of vaginal irritation and malodorous vaginal discharge. RESULTS: Based on Gram stain the majority of smears revealed a mixed microflora that had some similarity with bacterial vaginosis (BV) microflora and that contained various amounts of cocci, polymorphous Gram-negative and Gram-positive rods, often with fusiform and comma-shaped rods, and sometimes even with spirochetes. Candida cells were not seen in any of the smears. On average 8.6 species were cultured per woman. The species most often found were: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus anginosus group spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium sp., Mobiluncus curtisii and Bacteroides ureolyticus. Lactobacilli were found in only one of 30 women. There was no correlation between dilatation habits, having coitus, rinsing habits and malodorous vaginal discharge on the one hand and the presence of a particular species on the other. There was however a highly significant correlation between the presence of E. faecalis on the one hand and sexual orientation and coitus on the other (p = 0.003 and p = 0.027 respectively). Respectively 82%, 58% and 30% of the samples showed an amplicon after amplification with M. curtisii, Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis primer sets. CONCLUSION: Our study is the first to describe the microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women. It reveals a mixed microflora of aerobe and anaerobe species usually found either on the skin, in the intestinal microflora or in a BV microflora.
TI  - Placental histological inflammation and reproductive tract infections in a low risk pregnant population in Latvia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the correlation of reproductive tract infections (RTI) and endogenous vaginal flora at first antenatal consultation with placental histological inflammation. METHODS: In a follow-up study, 154 low risk women with no miscarriage risk factors were examined for the presence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS), Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis (GDS) and bacterial vaginosis (BV). At delivery, outcome data were collected and the histology of the placenta was studied. RESULTS: Some 85 (56.3%) of all pregnant women had RTI or endogenous vaginal flora. Placental histological inflammation correlated with genital tract colonisation with G. vaginalis (p =0.013), BV (p =0.031), S. aureus (p =0.04) and aerobic vaginitis (p =0.017). BV and BV-related G. vaginalis correlated with the presence of parietal and placental chorioamnionitis in 53.8 and 43.5% of cases. Genital tract colonisation with GDS and other aerobic flora in combination with inflammatory vaginitis correlated with the presence of funisitis in 33.3 and 40.0% of cases. Mycoplasmas increased the risk for intrauterine infection only when present in combination with other RTIs (p =0.023). CONCLUSION: Histological placental inflammation is associated with both BV and genital tract colonisation with aerobic bacteria, while funisitis is associated with colonisation of aerobic bacteria at first prenatal visit before the 17th gestational week.
TI  - Cervical immunoglobulin A and altered vaginal flora in pregnant women with threatened preterm delivery.
AB  - The aim of our study was to investigate the cervical immunoglobulin A concentration in women with threatened preterm delivery. Immunoglobulin A concentration in the cervical mucus of 80 women with symptoms of preterm delivery was measured using radial immunodiffusion. The results were compared with those of 60 healthy pregnant women. Concentrations of immunoglobulins in maternal serum were also measured. There was no significant difference of cervical immunoglobulin A (IgA) concentration between women with threatened preterm delivery and controls: 53.98 (0.0-189.7) mg/l vs. 61.7 (1.4-400.9; p<0.4) mg/l (median, range). The median of cervical IgA levels in the group of threatened preterm delivery did not differ significantly between patients delivered preterm (n=34) or at term (n=46): 38.3 (0.0-187.9) vs. 65.7 (1.4-189.7; p<0.2) mg/l. Women with a normal vaginal flora showed a significantly higher cervical IgA concentration than those with a pathological colonization: 72.7 (0.0-187.9) vs. 42.5 (0.0-189.7) mg/l. Patients with a pathological vaginal smear and preterm delivery had the lowest IgA levels (35.0; 0.0-187.9 mg/l). Measurement of cervical IgA concentration does not differentiate between women who deliver before or at term.
TI  - Vaginal microbiota in healthy pregnant women and prenatal screening of group B streptococci (GBS).
AB  - The microbiota of the lower female genital tract was evaluated from vaginal swabs obtained from 623 healthy pregnant women at gestation periods of 35-40 weeks. Isolated and identified microorganisms were expressed as percentages of total samples. As expected, lactobacilli made up the dominant vaginal microbiota (70%). Enterobacteriaceae, mainly Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus, were present in 38% of the samples, which might reflect the possible contamination of vaginal tract with rectal microorganisms. Candida albicans was present in 10% of healthy pregnant woman assayed. Streptoccocci (Streptococcus sp. and Enterococcus faecalis with 3% and 4%, respectively) and other gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus sp., 5%), along with other microorgansisms such as Gardnerella vaginalis (5%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2%) may represent a potential infection risk. Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococci beta-hemolytic, GBS) was detected in 7% of the samples. GBS infection is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality in the developed world. Furthermore, GBS was often co-isolated with C. albicans (54.5%) in the samples. A complete and detailed evaluation of the vaginal biota swab, with particular attention to the presence of potential pathogens such as GBS, is a preventive strategy that can provide useful information to obstetricians and gynecologist in managing the last days of pregnancy and delivery.
TI  - In vitro antagonistic effect of Lactobacillus on organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess antagonistic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women as compared to the most common bacterial agents related to vaginosis. STUDY DESIGN: Antagonistic activity of different Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women not treated for infections with an antibiotic for the previous three months was screened using an agar slab method. The activity was tested against test organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis and/or urinary tract infections: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Prevotella bivia. RESULTS: Many of the 146 Lactobacillus strains tested exerted apparent antagonistic activities against gram-positive aerobic cocci and gram-negative rods, such as S aureus and E coli, and a marked number of Lactobacillus strains inhibited facultative bacteria, such as Gardnerella vaginalis and the anaerobes P anaerobius and P bivia. Only a few lactobacilli were able to inhibit growth of E faecalis and S agalactiae. Indicator bacteria growth inhibition probably relies upon several different complementary mechanisms. The specific indicator bacteria species determines which mechanism predominates. CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus strains taken from normal vaginal flora demonstrated antagonistic activity against a variety of bacteria related to vaginal and urinary tract infections. The specific occurrence rates of active Lactobacillus strains are different, and this difference is dependent on the indicator bacteria species.
TI  - Detection of cervical immunoglobulin A in normal pregnancy.
AB  - The aim of our study was to evaluate a feasible method to quantify the immunoglobulin A concentration in the cervical mucus of women with a normal singleton pregnancy. In 60 immunologic healthy pregnant women cervical mucus samples were taken at a random time in pregnancy using an absorbing cylindrical cotton-swab stick. In this cervical mucus immunoglobulin A concentration was measured by radial immunodiffusion. A vaginal bacterial swab was taken from each woman. Concentration of immunoglobulins in maternal serum was estimated. There was no statistically significant difference of cervical immunoglobulin A concentration between the investigated groups (p = 0.952): 18-24 gestational weeks (gw): 52.8 (6.6-258.4) mg/l; 25-29 gw: 89.3 (4.8-193.8) mg/l; 30-34 gw: 55 (1.4-326) mg/l; 35-40 gw: 59.2 (4-400.9) mg/l. Women with a normal vaginal flora showed a significantly higher cervical immunoglobulin A concentration than those with a pathological colonization: 92.2 (6.6-400.9) mg/l vs. 42.5 (1.4-326) mg/l (p < 0.05). The serum levels of immunoglobulins A, A1, A2, M and G do not correlate to cervical immunoglobulin A levels nor to gestational age. In normal pregnancy, cervical immunoglobulin A concentration does not change with advancing gestational age, but a pathological vaginal colonization seems to be associated with decreased immunoglobulin A levels.
TI  - [The range of antagonistic effects of Lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia, Bacteroides spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., Mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. On the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus Lactobacillus, most frequently L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus and L. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the same environment. The diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. Thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this ecosystem. The aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. It was found that nearly all of the tested Lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against Gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit Gram-positive aerobic cocci as Enterococcus faecalis or Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - [The antagonistic activity of bifidobacteria in vitro and in vivo studied by using gnotobiological technology].
AB  - The antagonistic activity of 4 strains of bifidobacteria (B. adolescentis 2 F1, B. longum Z4, B. breve R2 and B. bifidum G1), isolated from the vagina of healthy females of the reproductive age, with respect to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella ozaenae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gardnerella vaginalis were studied in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro experiments revealed that all above-mentioned bifidobacteria were capable of inhibiting the growth of all indicator bacterial strains. Still of all the bifidobacteria under study had different levels of activity. B. adolescentis strain 2 F1 exhibited the highest inhibiting activity in vitro. In contrast to in vitro experiments, in vivo experiments with B. breve R2 demonstrated its high antagonistic activity with respect to E. coli. The data thus obtained indicate that in the study of antagonistic activity the use of the in vivo model as also expedient, for it is mainly in vivo that probiotic preparations show their activity.
TI  - Bacteriological epidemiology and treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - One hundred symptomatic women with clinical bacterial vaginosis (BV) were enrolled in this study. The bacteriological epidemiology of BV and efficacy of oral or vaginal administration of antimicrobial agents for treatment of BV were investigated. The epidemiology of BV was investigated before antimicrobial therapy. Fifty patients were treated with oral administration of metronidazole (MTN), 500 mg twice a day, and 50 patients with 2% clindamycin (CLDM) phosphate in a vaginal cream, 5 g once a day for 7 days. The major organisms occurring were Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus species, Bacteroides species, Prevotella species, and Mobiluncus species and opportunistic pathogens such as Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis. The therapeutic efficacy of CLDM cream on BV appeared to be preferable to oral MTN from clinical and bacteriological aspects. The clinical and bacteriological effectiveness of MTN and CLDM in the treatment of BV suggests that anaerobes might play a major role in causing the clinical symptoms in patients with BV.
TI  - [The isolation of Streptococcus morbillorum from vaginal exudates].
AB  - We have tested 195 vaginal secretions sent by Gynecology Service of this hospital between the years 1988-1990. We achieved positive culture for streptococci in 58 (30%) of these cultures, 26 (44.8%) corresponding to Streptococcus morbillorum 9 (15.5%), to Gardnerella vaginalis 5 (8.6%), to Enterococcus faecalis-durans and to Streptococcus agalactiae, 3 (5.1%) to Streptococcus mitis and milleri 2 (3.4%), to Streptococcus bovis and cremoris, and 1 (1.7%) to Streptococcus salivarius, equinus and sanguis II respectively. We previously found that 52.8% of these patients were positive for vaginal candidiasis. The bacteriological identification done by the API 20 STREP System (bioMerieux GmbH, Nutingen, Germany) provides a typical pattern ("good identification") for the Streptococcus morbillorum.
TI  - [Gardnerella vaginalis: transport, microscopy, testing resistance].
AB  - G. vaginalis is an important pathogen in the aetiology of bacterial vaginosis. Therefore, we investigated the influence of transport systems in isolation, a scoring system for Gram stains, and susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. The comparison between a simple (Transwab) and a sophisticated (Port-A-Cul) system showed no differences with regard to for instance Enterococcus faecalis or Escherichia coli; however, isolation of G. vaginalis, a fastidious microorganism, was significantly higher (alpha < 0.0001) in Port-A-Cul. There was a strong correlation (97.5%) using the scoring system indicating bacterial vaginosis and isolation of G. vaginalis. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of metronidazole for 60 strains of G. vaginalis were higher than 32 mg/l, some strains showing heteroresistance. This phenomenon may be an explanation for treatment failures. Clindamycin and erythromycin were much more active, with MIC's between 0.016 and 0.19 mg/l, in-vitro development of resistance being slower for clindamycin than for erythromycin. CONCLUSIONS: (I) for isolation of G. vaginalis, a sophisticated transport system is mandatory; (II) a scoring system for Gram staining is helpful in diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis; (III) in patients with metronidazole treatment failures, clindamycin should be used.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, FK037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between January 1992 and June 1993. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for Streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for Peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis. FK037 was superior in potency to ceftazidime against all strains except E. faecalis, P. anaerobius and P. bivia. It was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and P. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. FK037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against MRSA, S. agalactiae and E. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except G. vaginalis and B. fragilis that were 4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to FK037.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activities of the new quinolone, Bay y 3118, and ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, CI-960 and CI-990.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of the new quinolone, Bay y 3118, was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, CI-960 and CI-990 against 1640 isolates belonging to 117 bacterial species. Against members of the Enterobacteriaceae, Bay y 3118 was as active as CI-960 and CI-990, up to four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and tosufloxacin and up to 16-fold more active than sparfloxacin. The majority of Enterobacteriaceae which were resistant to ciprofloxacin (MICs > or = 2 mg/L) were sensitive to Bay y 3118. With the exception of ciprofloxacin which was less active, the activities of Bay y 3118 and the other comparator compounds were similar against Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter genospecies 3 and Acinetobacter strain 84. Bay y 3118 inhibited Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates at concentrations comparable with those of ciprofloxacin. However, non-aeruginosa Pseudomonas spp. were four times more susceptible to Bay y 3118 than to ciprofloxacin. All of the agents tested were equally active against Haemophilus, Moraxella, Neisseria and Bordetella spp. Against staphylococci, Bay y 3118 was the most active compound, followed jointly by CI-990, sparfloxacin, CI-960 and tosufloxacin, and then ciprofloxacin. Bay y 3118 remained highly active against Staphylococcus aureus strains resistant to ciprofloxacin; the MIC90 (0.5 mg/L) was 16-fold less than that of CI-990 and sparfloxacin, 32-fold less than that of CI-960 and 128-fold less than that of tosufloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Against haemolytic and non-haemolytic streptococci and Enterococcus faecalis, Bay y 3118 was two- to 16-fold more active than the other compounds. It had only moderate activity against Listeria spp., but this was superior to that of all the other compounds tested. Bay y 3118 was also the most active agent overall against anaerobic bacteria, although CI-960 and CI-990 had slightly better activity against Gardnerella vaginalis. It inhibited Mycobacterium spp. other than Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium scrofulaceum, Mycobacterium gordonae, Mycobacterium xenopi, Mycobacterium flavescens, Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium fortuitum) at concentrations < or = 0.06-4 mg/L and was between two- and 128-fold more active than the other compounds against these isolates; the two strains each of Mycobacterium terrae and Mycobacterium nonchromogenicum were resistant to Bay y 3118. In this study, Bay y 3118 was shown to be the most active and most broad-spectrum of the new quinolone and naphthyridine derivatives.
TI  - [Gardnerella vaginalis in infections of reproductive organs].
AB  - The study was aimed at multidirectional studies on bacteria isolated from smears  from vagina and cervix uteri in 226 patients with inflammatory states of their reproductive organs. Most frequently isolated aerobic bacteria were Gram-negative--27%, mainly E. coli, and Enterococcus faecalis--in 18% of cases. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 81% of cases: Gardnerella vaginalis was isolated in 28% and Lactobacillus in 53% of cases. Other anaerobic bacteria were: Peptococcus asaccharolyticus (15.5%), Streptococcus sp. (15.9%), and Bacteroides melaninogenicus (14.1%). Gardnerella vaginalis was most frequently found in chronic cases of vaginosis (41.7%). All strains of G. vaginalis were susceptible to cefotaxime, while 15-40% of them were resistant to gentamycin, tetracycline and metronidazole.
TI  - Susceptibility of female pelvic pathogens to oral antibiotic agents in patients who develop postpartum endometritis.
AB  - Fifteen hundred patients were enrolled in a prospective, randomized study on the  effect of antibiotic prophylaxis during cesarean section. Two hundred thirty-one patients developed postpartum endometritis, and the isolates obtained from the endometrium were tested for sensitivity to ampicillin, cefuroxime, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and clindamycin. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of 50% and 90% of ampicillin, cefuroxime, and clindamycin were similar to previously reported values; however, slight differences were noted in the activity of the two quinolones to common pelvic isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of 90% of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin to 119 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis were 4.0 and 2.0, to 17 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus 1.0 and 0.5, to 39 isolates of Escherichia coli 0.5 and 1.0, to 46 isolates of Bacteroides bivius 4.0 and 8.0, to 57 isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis 1.0 and 2.0, to 71 isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis 0.5 and 0.5, to 16 isolates of Proteus mirabilis 0.25 and 0.12, and to 50 isolates of Lactobacillus species 32.0 and 8.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. In summary, the quinolones have activity comparable with a variety of other oral agents versus female pelvic pathogens, with the quinolones ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin having better activity against most of the gram-negative isolates. Anaerobic activities were comparable with the beta-lactams, but inferior to clindamycin and metronidazole as expected.
TI  - Genetic basis of tetracycline resistance in urogenital bacteria.
AB  - The distributions of the nucleotide sequences related to the tetracycline resistance determinants Tet K, Tet L, Tet M, and Tet O were studied by dot blot hybridization with randomly chosen clinical urogenital tract isolates of viridans group streptococci, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Lactobacillus spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus spp., and Veillonella parvula. Among the Peptostreptococcus spp., 79% of the isolates hybridized with one (64%) or more (36%) of the probes for Tet K (27%), Tet L (30%), Tet M (75%) and Tet O (13%). Of the viridans group streptococci, 82% of the strains hybridized with one (34%) or more (66%) of the four probes. The distribution of the four determinants in this group was as follows: Tet K, 36%; Tet L, 31%; Tet M, 43%; Tet O, 61%. Twenty-nine percent of the enterococci and forty-six percent of the group B streptococci hybridized with the probes; however, the Tet K, Tet L, and Tet O determinants were found in only a few strains, while the Tet M determinant predominated. A total of 29% of the F. nucleatum isolates, 55% of the G. vaginalis isolates, and 26% of the V. parvula isolates hybridized with the Tet M determinant. In contrast, 43% of the Lactobacillus spp. hybridized with the Tet O determinant. The data indicate that tetracycline resistance determinants are common to many of the microorganisms isolated from the urogenital tract.
TI  - In-vitro studies with ramoplanin (MDL 62,198): a novel lipoglycopeptide antimicrobial.
AB  - Ramoplanin is a novel lipoglycopeptide antimicrobial complex, isolated from the fermentation products of a strain of Actinoplanes sp. (ATCC 33076), which comprises three closely related polypeptides, each containing chlorinated phenyl moieties and D-mannose. The in-vitro activity of ramoplanin was compared with those of vancomycin and teicoplanin. Ramoplanin was very active against Staphylococcus spp., irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, with all isolates inhibited by 1 mg/l or less. Concentrations of vancomycin and teicoplanin required to inhibit the same population of bacteria were 4 and 16 mg/l, respectively. Ramoplanin was also very active against Streptococcus spp. (alpha- and beta-haemolytic species, Str. pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium spp. (including Cory. jeikeium), Listeria monocytogenes, Gardnerella vaginalis, Propionibacterium acnes and Gram-positive anaerobic bacteria, with all isolates inhibited by 2 mg/l, or less. In general, the activity of ramoplanin against these species was either equal to or only slightly less than teicoplanin and equal to or somewhat greater than vancomycin. With the exception of Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bact. bivius, ramoplanin was not active against Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - The midcycle cervical microbial flora as studied by the weighed-swab method, and  its possible correlation with results of sperm cervical mucus penetration tests.
AB  - Infertile couples undergoing routine investigation for infertility were randomly  selected for the study. A quantitative method using weighed swabs was found satisfactory for the study of microbial flora in the midcycle cervical mucus. In 6 of the 20 women, the midcycle cervical mucus was hostile in the sperm cervical mucus penetration tests. The total bacterial counts and the number of species (average, 2.5) isolated from the hostile mucus were significantly greater than those from the receptive mucus (average, 1.3). Only normal vaginal/cervical flora was isolated. Ureaplasma urealyticum was found more frequently in patients undergoing clomiphene citrate therapy (6/10 versus 0/9, P less than 0.03, Fischer's Exact test).
TI  - Inhibition of some normal and pathogenic vaginal bacteria by oral and vaginal streptococci.
AB  - Hemolytic and nonhemolytic strains of Streptococcus faecalis, together with some  strains of oral and vaginal alpha-hemolytic streptococci, produced one or more factors that inhibited the growth of Gardnerella vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and a variety of other vaginal bacteria. Some streptococci were inhibitory to indicator organisms only in the presence of catalase, whereas catalase either enhanced or prevented inhibitory action for still other streptococci. The inhibitors produced by certain streptococci resembled enterococcal bacteriocins, which have not previously been found to inhibit G. vaginalis or N. gonorrhoeae.
