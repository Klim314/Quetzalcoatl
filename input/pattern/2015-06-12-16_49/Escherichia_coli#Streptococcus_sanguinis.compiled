TI  - Antimicrobial Activity of Chemokine CXCL10 for Dermal and Oral Microorganisms.
AB  - CXCL10 (IP-10) is a small 10 kDa chemokine with antimicrobial activity. It is induced by IFN-gamma, chemoattracts mononuclear cells, and promotes adhesion of T cells. Recently, we detected CXCL10 on the surface of the skin and in the oral cavity. In the current study, we used broth microdilution and radial diffusion assays to show that CXCL10 inhibits the growth of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium jeikeium, Corynebacterium striatum, and Candida albicans HMV4C, but not Corynebacterium bovis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Poryphromonas gingivalis, or C. albicans ATCC 64124. The reason for the selective antimicrobial activity is not yet known. However, antimicrobial activity of CXCL10 may be related to its composition and structure, as a cationic 98 amino acid residue molecule with 10 lysine residues, 7 arginine residues, a total net charge of +11, and a theoretical pI of 9.93. Modeling studies revealed that CXCL10 contains an alpha-helix at the N-terminal, three anti-parallel beta-strands in the middle, and an alpha-helix at the C-terminal. Thus, CXCL10, when produced on the surface of the skin or in the oral cavity, likely has antimicrobial activity and may enhance innate antimicrobial and cellular responses to the presence of select commensal or opportunistic microorganisms.
TI  - Introducing a semi-coated model to investigate antibacterial effects of biocompatible polymers on titanium surfaces.
AB  - Peri-implant infections from bacterial biofilms on artificial surfaces are a common threat to all medical implants. They are a handicap for the patient and can lead to implant failure or even life-threatening complications. New implant surfaces have to be developed to reduce biofilm formation and to improve the long-term prognosis of medical implants. The aim of this study was (1) to develop a new method to test the antibacterial efficacy of implant surfaces by direct surface contact and (2) to elucidate whether an innovative antimicrobial copolymer coating of 4-vinyl-N-hexylpyridinium bromide and dimethyl(2-methacryloyloxyethyl) phosphonate (VP:DMMEP 30:70) on titanium is able to reduce the attachment of bacteria prevalent in peri-implant infections. With a new in vitro model with semi-coated titanium discs, we were able to show a dramatic reduction in the adhesion of various pathogenic bacteria (Streptococcus sanguinis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis), completely independently of effects caused by soluble materials. In contrast, soft tissue cells (human gingival or dermis fibroblasts) were less affected by the same coating, despite a moderate reduction in initial adhesion of gingival fibroblasts. These data confirm the hypothesis that VP:DMMEP 30:70 is a promising antibacterial copolymer that may be of use in several clinical applications.
TI  - Effective release of a broad spectrum antibiotic from elastin-like polypeptide-collagen composite.
AB  - Preparation of hydrogels that possess an effective antibiotic release profile and better mechanical properties compared to the traditionally used collagen hydrogels has the potential to minimize post-surgical infections and support wound healing. Toward this goal, we prepared elastin-like polypeptide (ELP)-collagen composite hydrogels that displayed a significantly higher elastic modulus compared to the collagen hydrogels. We then characterized the release behavior of the collagen and ELP-collagen hydrogels loaded with varying dosages (1-5% w/w) of a commonly used broad spectrum antibiotic, doxycycline hyclate. Both collagen and ELP-collagen hydrogels showed a gradual time dependent doxycycline release over a period of 5 days. The ELP-collagen hydrogels, in general, showed a slower release of the doxycycline compared to the collagen hydrogels. The released doxycycline was found to be effective against four bacterial strains (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus sanguinis, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) in a dose dependent manner. Combined with their improved mechanical properties, the gradual and effective drug release from the biocompatible ELP-collagen hydrogels shown here may be beneficial for drug delivery and tissue engineering applications.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of Iranian green-tea-containing mouthrinse vs chlorhexidine  0.2%: an in vitro study.
AB  - PURPOSE: Considering the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of green tea, this study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial effect of mouthrinses containing green tea extract vs 0.2% chlorhexidine on selected microorganisms in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antibacterial activity of both mouthrinses and the pure green tea extract was assessed by using disk diffusion and the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods against five microorganisms: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aerogenosa and Escherichia coli. Growth inhibition zones were measured in mm after 24 h of incubation at 37 degrees C. The two mouthrinses were assessed at concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512 mg/ml to determine the MIC, which was interpreted as the lowest concentration of the agent that completely inhibited the growth of the test species. RESULTS: 0.2% chlorhexidine produced a larger zone of growth inhibition than did the mouthrinse made of green tea extract (P < 0.01). Paradoxically, the growth inhibition zones of the tested bacteria were significantly larger in pure extract of green tea than in 0.2% chlorhexidine (P < 0.01). The chlorhexidine mouthrinse inhibited the growth of all tested species and exhibited significantly lower MICs than did the green tea mouthrinse (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Even though the mouthrinse made with green tea extract presented an in vitro antimicrobial activity inferior to 0.2% chlorhexidine, the pure extract had considerable bactericidal effect.
TI  - [Evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (SNP's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for therapeutic purposes. It is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal SNP's possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of SNP's against cariogenic bacteria: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus mitis responsible for initiation of dental carries. Tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. Nanotechnology creates a new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. METHODS: Colloidal silver solution (CSS) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. Nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis and S, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs of 7 patients treated for dental carries at Department of Conservative Dentistry, Medical University of Warsaw. MIC and MBC values for CSS's were evaluated. RESULTS: CSS used in this research is of good stability. No agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. Silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. MIC values were: 12-25 ppm for S. salivarius, 25 ppm for S. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for S. mitis and 50 ppm for S. mutans, while MBC values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. After 24 hours of contact MBC values were: 25-50 ppm for S. salivarius and S. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for S. mitis and 200 ppmfor S. mutans. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial properties of CSS depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. The susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. Sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.
TI  - Evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  VersaTREK blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  - The Verigene Gram-positive blood culture (BC-GP) assay (Nanosphere, Northbrook, IL) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of Gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. A total of 148 VersaTREK REDOX 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating Gram-positive bacteria were tested. Results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) identifications. We obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (24), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (14), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) (17), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), Streptococcus salivarius (5), Streptococcus parasanguinis (2), Streptococcus sanguinis (1), Streptococcus cristatus (1), the Streptococcus bovis group (5), Streptococcus agalactiae (9), the Streptococcus anginosus group (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE FCM) (16), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (3), Aerococcus viridans (2), Bacillus (6), Corynebacterium (8), Lactobacillus (2), Micrococcus (2), Neisseria mucosa (1), Escherichia coli (3), Candida tropicalis (1), Propionibacterium (1), and Rothia (1). Overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. A total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. We tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. A chart review of 31 patients with MRSA, MSSA, or VRE demonstrated that the Nanosphere BC-GP assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. Additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with MRSA or VRE. The BC-GP assay may have a positive impact on patient care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.
TI  - [Comparison of in vitro antimicrobial activities of bioaggregate and mineral trioxide aggregate].
AB  - Treatment outcome of endodontic perforations depends on successful elimination of the associated microorganisms and infected tissues as well as the effective seal of the root-end or perforation site to prevent future contamination. Ideally, perforation repair material has to be bacteriostatic or bactericidal in order to prevent bacterial contamination as well as good sealing properties and biocompatibility. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of BioAggregate (BA) and Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) on the standard strains of Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using the agar disc diffusion test. Colonies of each strains were harvested from the medium and microorganisms were diluted to obtain a suspension of approximately 108 cfu/ml. Petri plates with blood agar base with 5% sheep blood or Sabouraud dextrose agar (for C.albicans) were inoculated with experimental suspensions and BA and MTA discs prepared as 2 mm length and 6 mm diameter were placed. After 24 and 48 hours incubation, the diameters of the zones of inhibition were measured. The results of the disc diffusion tests showed that BA and MTA were effective on the tested microorganisms at 24 and 48 hours incubation periods. BA and MTA showed similar antimicrobial effects on C.albicans and E.coli. BA was more effective than MTA on S.mutans, E.faecalis and P.aeruginosa, however MTA was more effective than BA on S.sanguinis at 48 hours. When the time efficiency of the materials were compared, there was no statistically difference between 24 to 48 hours on E.coli, E.faecalis, S.mutans, S.sanguinis in both two groups (p> 0.05). There was statistically significant decrease 24 to 48 hours on C.albicans in BA and MTA groups and P.aeruginosa in BA group (p< 0.05). It can be concluded that although BA and MTA displayed similar antimicrobial efficacy on the tested microorganisms newly improved material BA demonstrated superior antimicrobial activity than other.
TI  - Inhibition of initial adhesion of oral bacteria through a lectin from Bauhinia variegata L. var. variegata expressed in Escherichia coli.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of the present work was to study the in vitro effect of native and  recombinant Bauhinia variegata var. variegata lectins in inhibiting early adhesion of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus sobrinus to experimentally acquired pellicle. METHODS AND RESULTS: Native lectin from B. variegata (BVL) was purified by affinity chromatography of extract of seeds. The recombinant lectin (rBVL-I) was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) from a genomic clone encoding the mature B. variegata lectin gene using the vector pAE-bvlI. Recombinant protein deposited in inclusion bodies was solubilized and subsequently purified by affinity chromatography. The rBVL-I was compared to BVL for agglutination of erythrocytes and initial adherence of oral bacteria on a saliva-coated surface. The results revealed that rBVL-I acts similarly to BVL for agglutination of erythrocytes. Both lectins showed adhesion inhibition effect on Step. sanguis, Step. mutans and Step. sobrinus. CONCLUSION: We report, for the first time, the inhibition of early adhesion of oral bacteria by a recombinant lectin. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our results support the proposed biotechnological application of lectins in a strategy to reduce development of dental caries by inhibiting the initial adhesion and biofilm formation.
TI  - Cloning-independent plasmid construction for genetic studies in streptococci.
AB  - Shuttle plasmids are among the few routinely utilized tools in the Streptococcus  mutans genetic system that still require the use of classical cloning methodologies and intermediate hosts for genetic manipulation. Accordingly, it typically requires considerably less time and effort to introduce mutations onto the S. mutans chromosome than it does to construct shuttle vectors for expressing genes in trans. Occasionally, shuttle vector constructs also exhibit toxicity in Escherichia coli, which prevents their proper assembly. To circumvent these limitations, we modified a prolonged overlap extension PCR (POE-PCR) protocol to facilitate direct plasmid assembly in S. mutans. Using solely PCR, we created the reporter vector pZX7, which contains a single minimal streptococcal replication origin and harbors a spectinomycin resistance cassette and the gusA gene encoding beta-glucuronidase. We compared the efficiency of pZX7 assembly using multiple strains of S. mutans and were able to obtain from 5 x 10(3) to 2 x 10(5) CFU/mug PCR product. Likewise, we used pZX7 to further demonstrate that Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus gordonii are also excellent hosts for cloning-independent plasmid assembly, which suggests that this system is likely to function in numerous other streptococci. Consequently, it should be possible to completely forgo the use of E. coli-Streptococcus shuttle vectors in many streptococcal species, thereby decreasing the time and effort required to assemble constructs and eliminating any toxicity issues associated with intermediate hosts.
TI  - Design, structural and spectroscopic elucidation, and the in vitro biological activities of new diorganotin dithiocarbamates.
AB  - The reaction of 2,2-dimethoxy-N-methylethyllamine or 2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane with  CS(2) in alkaline media produced two novel dithiocarbamate salts. Subsequent reactions with organotin halides yielded six new complexes: [SnMe(2){S(2)CNR(R(1))(2)}(2)] (1), [Sn(n-Bu)(2){S(2)CNR(R(1))(2)}(2)] (2), [SnPh(2){S(2)CNR(R(1))(2)}(2)] (3), [SnMe(2){S(2)CNR(R(2))(2)}(2)] (4), [Sn(n-Bu)(2){S(2)CNR(R(2))(2)}(2)] (5), [SnPh(2){S(2)CNR(R(2))(2)}(2)] (6), where R = methyl, R(1) = CH(2)CH(OMe)(2), and R(2) = 2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane. All compounds were identified in terms of infrared, (1)H and (13)C NMR, and the complexes were also characterized using (119)Sn NMR, (119)Sn Mossbauer and X-ray crystallography. The biological activity of all derivatives has been screened in terms of IC(90) and IC(50) against Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus parasiticus, Penicillium citrinum, Curvularia senegalensis, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus sanguinis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Salmonella typhimurium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the results correlated well with a performed study of structure-activity relationship (SAR). Complexes (3), (5) and (6) displayed the best IC(90) and IC(50) in the presence of the fungi, greater than that of miconazole, used as control drug.
TI  - Potential Infectious Etiology of Behcet's Disease.
AB  - Behcet's disease is a multisystem inflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent oral aphthous ulcers, genital ulcers, uveitis, and skin lesions. The cause of Behcet's disease remains unknown, but epidemiologic findings suggest that an autoimmune process is triggered by an environmental agent in a genetically predisposed individual. An infectious agent could operate through molecular mimicry, and subsequently the disease could be perpetuated by an abnormal immune response to an autoantigen in the absence of ongoing infection. Potentia bacterial are Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mycobacteria, Borrelia burgdorferi, Helicobacter pylori, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycoplasma fermentans, but the most commonly investigated microorganism is Streptococcus sanguinis. The relationship between streptococcal infections and Behcet's disease is suggested by clinical observations that an unhygienic oral condition is frequently noted in the oral cavity of Behcet's disease patients. Several viral agents, including herpes simplex virus-1, hepatitis C virus, parvovirus B19, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus and varicella zoster virus, may also have some role.
TI  - Influence of specific amino acid side-chains on the antimicrobial activity and structure of bovine lactoferrampin.
AB  - Lactoferrin is an 80 kDa iron binding protein found in the secretory fluids of mammals and it plays a major role in host defence. An antimicrobial peptide, lactoferrampin, was identified through sequence analysis of bovine lactoferrin and its antimicrobial activity against a wide range of bacteria and yeast species is well documented. In the present work, the contribution of specific amino acid residues of lactoferrampin was examined to evaluate the role that they play in membrane binding and bilayer disruption. The structures of all the bovine lactoferrampin derivatives were examined with circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and their interactions with phospholipids were evaluated with differential scanning calorimetry and isothermal titration calorimetry techniques. From our results it is apparent that the amphipathic N-terminal helix anchors the peptide to membranes with Trp 268 and Phe 278 playing important roles in determining the strength of the interaction and for inducing peptide folding. In addition, the N-terminal helix capping residues (DLI) increase the affinity for negatively charged vesicles and they mediate the depth of membrane insertion. Finally, the unique flexibility in the cationic C-terminal region of bovine lactoferrampin does not appear to be essential for the antimicrobial activity of the peptide.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of sphingoid bases and fatty acids against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - There is growing evidence that the role of lipids in innate immunity is more important than previously realized. How lipids interact with bacteria to achieve a level of protection, however, is still poorly understood. To begin to address the mechanisms of antibacterial activity, we determined MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of lipids common to the skin and oral cavity--the sphingoid bases D-sphingosine, phytosphingosine, and dihydrosphingosine and the fatty acids sapienic acid and lauric acid--against four Gram-negative bacteria and seven Gram-positive bacteria. Exact Kruskal-Wallis tests of these values showed differences among lipid treatments (P < 0.0001) for each bacterial species except Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. D-sphingosine (MBC range, 0.3 to 19.6 mug/ml), dihydrosphingosine (MBC range, 0.6 to 39.1 mug/ml), and phytosphingosine (MBC range, 3.3 to 62.5 mug/ml) were active against all bacteria except S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa (MBC > 500 mug/ml). Sapienic acid (MBC range, 31.3 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mitis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum but not active against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa, Corynebacterium bovis, Corynebacterium striatum, and Corynebacterium jeikeium (MBC > 500 mug/ml). Lauric acid (MBC range, 6.8 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against all bacteria except E. coli, S. marcescens, and P. aeruginosa (MBC > 500 mug/ml). Complete killing was achieved as early as 0.5 h for some lipids but took as long as 24 h for others. Hence, sphingoid bases and fatty acids have different antibacterial activities and may have potential for prophylactic or therapeutic intervention in infection.
TI  - Synthesis, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activity of novel silver(I) tris(pyrazolyl)methanesulfonate and 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphadamantane complexes.
AB  - Five new silver(I) complexes of formulas [Ag(Tpms)] (1), [Ag(Tpms)(PPh(3))] (2),  [Ag(Tpms)(PCy(3))] (3), [Ag(PTA)][BF(4)] (4), and [Ag(Tpms)(PTA)] (5) {Tpms = tris(pyrazol-1-yl)methanesulfonate, PPh(3) = triphenylphosphane, PCy(3) = tricyclohexylphosphane, PTA = 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane} have been synthesized and fully characterized by elemental analyses, (1)H, (13)C, and (31)P NMR, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and IR spectroscopic techniques. The single crystal X-ray diffraction study of 3 shows the Tpms ligand acting in the N(3)-facially coordinating mode, while in 2 and 5 a N(2)O-coordination is found, with the SO(3) group bonded to silver and a pendant free pyrazolyl ring. Features of the tilting in the coordinated pyrazolyl rings in these cases suggest that this inequivalence is related with the cone angles of the phosphanes. A detailed study of antimycobacterial and antiproliferative properties of all compounds has been carried out. They were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against the standard strains Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29922), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 49619), Streptococcus pyogenes (SF37), Streptococcus sanguinis (SK36), Streptococcus mutans (UA159), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), and the fungus Candida albicans (ATCC 24443). Complexes 1-5 have been found to display effective antimicrobial activity against the series of bacteria and fungi, and some of them are potential candidates for antiseptic or disinfectant drugs. Interaction of Ag complexes with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has been studied by fluorescence spectroscopic techniques, using ethidium bromide (EB) as a fluorescence probe of DNA. The decrease in the fluorescence of DNA-EB system on addition of Ag complexes shows that the fluorescence quenching of DNA-EB complex occurs and compound 3 is particularly active. Complexes 1-5 exhibit pronounced antiproliferative activity against human malignant melanoma (A375) with an activity often higher than that of AgNO(3), which has been used as a control, following the same order of activity inhibition on DNA, i.e., 3 > 2 > 1 > 5 > AgNO(3)>> 4.
TI  - Influence of hyaluronic acid on bacterial and fungal species, including clinically relevant opportunistic pathogens.
AB  - Hyaluronic acid (HA) has several clinical applications (aesthetic surgery, dermatology, orthopaedics and ophtalmology). Following recent evidence, suggesting antimicrobial and antiviral properties for HA, we investigated its effects on 15 ATCC strains, representative of clinically relevant bacterial and fungal species. The in vitro system employed allowed to assess optical density of broth cultures as a measure of microbial load in a time-dependent manner. The results showed that different microbial species and, sometimes, different strains belonging to the same species, are differently affected by HA. In particular, staphylococci, enterococci, Streptococcus mutans, two Escherichia coli strains, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida glabrata and C. parapsilosis displayed a HA dose-dependent growth inhibition; no HA effects were detected in E. coli ATCC 13768 and C. albicans; S. sanguinis was favoured by the highest HA dose. Therefore, the influence of HA on bacteria and fungi warrants further studies aimed at better establishing its relevance in clinical applications.
TI  - Reduced-oxidized difference spectral analysis and chemiluminescence-based Scatchard analysis demonstrate selective binding of myeloperoxidase to microbes.
AB  - Myeloperoxidase (MPO), a microbicidal haloperoxidase of neutrophil leukocytes, was observed to selectively bind to bacteria. Binding was quantified by dithionite-reduced minus oxidized (R-O) difference spectral analysis. Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed large MPO binding by R-O difference spectral analysis, whereas Streptococcus sanguinis did not. For increased sensitivity, free and microbe-bound MPO and chloroperoxidase (CPO) activities were quantified by acid-optimum haloperoxidase-dependent chemiluminescence (CL) measurements, and these data were used for Scatchard analysis. The MPO bound/free (B/F) CL ratio was 49.5 for P. aeruginosa, 14.6 for Staphylococcus aureus, 2.8 for E. coli, 0.7 for Candida albicans and 0.4 for S. sanguinis. By comparison, the CPO B/F CL ratio was 0.03 for P. aeruginosa, 0.09 for S. aureus, 0.31 for E. coli, 0.18 for C. albicans and 0.16 for S. sanguinis. As a member of the lactic acid family of bacteria and a viridans streptococcus, S. sanguinis does not synthesize cytochromes and is catalase-negative. The metabolic products of S. sanguinis, i.e. lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide, provide optimal acidity and substrate for MPO oxidation of chloride to hypochlorite. Hypochlorite can react with organic substrates to yield dehydrogenated or chlorinated products, but when peroxide is not limiting, hypochlorite reacts with peroxide yielding singlet oxygen. The reactivity of hypochlorite is dependent on substrate availability. The microsecond half-life of electronically excited singlet oxygen restricts reactivity to within a radius of <0.25 microm; i.e. the reactivity of singlet oxygen is both substrate and half-life dependent. Poor MPO binding provides protection and possibly competitive advantage to viridans streptococci.
TI  - Ovarian hydrobursitis in female camels (Camelus dromedaries): biochemical, bacterial and protozoal evaluation.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate female camels affected with ovarian hydrobursitis (n = 31) for hematological and biochemical findings and for bacterial and protozoal infections. Blood samples were obtained and surgical ablation of the affected bursa was performed. Bursal fluid, follicular fluid, and serum were subjected to hormonal and biochemical analyses. Bursal fluids were cultured and colonies were identified using BioMerieux Vitek two compact system. Passive haemagglutination test was used for detection of Trypanosoma evansi. Indirect ELISA technique was carried out for detection of anti-Hydatid cysts anti-bodies. Neutrophilia was found in the affected animals (P = 0.01) with tendencies for monocytosis (P = 0.06) and eosinophelia (P = 0.05). Bursal fluid had a tendency for high estradiol-17beta concentration compared to blood serum (P = 0.07). Progesterone and cholesterol concentrations were similar in bursal fluid, follicular fluid and serum. Total protein, phosphorus, and magnesium concentrations were greater (P < 0.05) in the bursal fluid than in serum. Oligella urethralis, Alloiococcus otitis, Granulicatella adicens, Escherichia coli, Sphingobacterium thalpophilum, Streptococcus sanguinis, Aeromonas salmonicida, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus hominis, and Rhizobium radiobacter were isolated from 46.7% of bursal fluids. T. evansi was positive in 9.7% of cases. None were positive for hydatid cyst. Accordingly, we suggest that the ovarian hydrobursitis syndrome is initially an inflammatory process and the accumulated bursal fluid is partially originated from follicular fluid.
TI  - Myeloperoxidase selectively binds and selectively kills microbes.
AB  - Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is reported to selectively bind to bacteria. The present study provides direct evidence of MPO binding selectivity and tests the relationship of selective binding to selective killing. The microbicidal effectiveness of H(2)O(2) and of OCl(-) was compared to that of MPO plus H(2)O(2). Synergistic microbicidal action was investigated by combining Streptococcus sanguinis, a H(2)O(2)-producing microbe showing low MPO binding, with high-MPO-binding Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa without exogenous H(2)O(2), with and without MPO, and with and without erythrocytes (red blood cells [RBCs]). Selectivity of MPO microbicidal action was conventionally measured as the MPO MIC and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) for 82 bacteria including E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and viridans streptococci. Both H(2)O(2) and OCl(-) destroyed RBCs at submicrobicidal concentrations. Nanomolar concentrations of MPO increased H(2)O(2) microbicidal action 1,000-fold. Streptococci plus MPO produced potent synergistic microbicidal action against all microbes tested, and RBCs caused only a small decrease in potency without erythrocyte damage. MPO directly killed H(2)O(2)-producing S. pyogenes but was ineffective against non-H(2)O(2)-producing E. faecalis. The MPO MICs and MBCs for E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus were significantly lower than those for E. faecalis. The streptococcal studies showed much higher MIC/MBC results, but such testing required lysed horse blood-supplemented medium, thus preventing valid comparison of these results to those for the other microbes. E. faecalis MPO binding is reportedly weak compared to binding of E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus but strong compared to binding of streptococci. Selective MPO binding results in selective killing.
TI  - Increased d-lactic Acid intestinal bacteria in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.
AB  - Patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) are affected by symptoms of cognitive dysfunction and neurological impairment, the cause of which has yet to be elucidated. However, these symptoms are strikingly similar to those of patients presented with D-lactic acidosis. A significant increase of Gram positive facultative anaerobic faecal microorganisms in 108 CFS patients as compared to 177 control subjects (p<0.01) is presented in this report. The viable count of D-lactic acid producing Enterococcus and Streptococcus spp. in the faecal samples from the CFS group (3.5 x 10(7) cfu/L and 9.8 x 10(7) cfu/L respectively) were significantly higher than those for the control group (5.0 x 10(6) cfu/L and 8.9 x 10(4) cfu/L respectively). Analysis of exometabolic profiles of Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus sanguinis, representatives of Enterococcus and Streptococcus spp. respectively, by NMR and HPLC showed that these organisms produced significantly more lactic acid (p<0.01) from (13)C-labeled glucose, than the Gram negative Escherichia coli. Further, both E. faecalis and S. sanguinis secrete more D-lactic acid than E. coli. This study suggests a probable link between intestinal colonization of Gram positive facultative anaerobic D-lactic acid bacteria and symptom expressions in a subgroup of patients with CFS. Given the fact that this might explain not only neurocognitive dysfunction in CFS patients but also mitochondrial dysfunction, these findings may have important clinical implications.
TI  - Analytical specificity and sensitivity of a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for identification of bovine mastitis pathogens.
AB  - Intramammary infection (IMI), also known as mastitis, is the most frequently occurring and economically the most important infectious disease in dairy cattle. This study provides a validation of the analytical specificity and sensitivity of a real-time PCR-based assay that identifies 11 major pathogen species or species groups responsible for IMI, and a gene coding for staphylococcal beta-lactamase production (penicillin resistance). Altogether, 643 culture isolates originating from clinical bovine mastitis, human, and companion animal samples were analyzed using the assay. The isolates represented 83 different species, groups, or families, and originated from 6 countries in Europe and North America. The analytical specificity and sensitivity of the assay was 100% in bacterial and beta-lactamase identification across all isolates originating from bovine mastitis (n = 454). When considering the entire culture collection (including also the isolates originating from human and companion animal samples), 4 Streptococcus pyogenes, 1 Streptococcus salivarius, and 1 Streptococcus sanguis strain of human origin were identified as Streptococcus uberis, and 3 Shigella spp. strains were identified as Escherichia coli, decreasing specificity to 99% in Strep. uberis and to 99.5% in E. coli. These false-positive results were confirmed by sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Specificity and sensitivity remained at 100% for all other bacterial targets across the entire culture collection. In conclusion, the real-time PCR assay shows excellent analytical accuracy and holds much promise for use in routine bovine IMI testing programs. This study provides the basis for evaluating the assay's diagnostic performance against the conventional bacterial culture method in clinical field trials using mastitis milk samples.
TI  - A quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. This can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. In this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. METHODS: Fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. Microorganisms were enumerated and identified. Bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated PBS solution for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. RESULTS: Counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) CFU. Candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. No obligate anaerobes were isolated. Members of Streptococcaceae family were regularly found (65.2%) belonging to the following species: Streptococcus pyogenes, S. mutans, S. mitis, S. oralis, S. sobrinus, S. viridans, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Aerococcus viridans. A. viridans and S. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis were found on adults brushes. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp. and Enterococcus sp., were also recovered. We found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. However, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. Decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. CONCLUSIONS: Ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. Maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.
TI  - Antimicrobial studies on extracts of four species of stachys.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of the methanol extracts of the dried flowering aerial parts of Stachys byzantina, S. inflata, S. lavandulifolia and S. laxa (Labiatae) were studied using the disc diffusion method and determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sanguis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Aspergilus niger and Candida albicans. The extracts of plants exhibited concentration-dependent antibacterial activity against the bacteria tested. The extracts were more active against Gram-positive microorganisms. The extracts, however, did not show any antifungal activity.
TI  - Screening of Amazonian plants from the Adolpho Ducke forest reserve, Manaus, state of Amazonas, Brazil, for antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Tropical forests are species-rich reserves for the discovery and development of antimicrobial drugs. The aim of this work is to investigate the in vitro antimicrobial potential of Amazon plants found within the National Institute on Amazon Research's Adolpho Ducke forest reserve, located in Manaus, state of Amazonas, Brazil. 75 methanol, chloroform and water extracts representing 12 plant species were tested for antimicrobial activity towards strains of Mycobacterium smegmatis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus oralis, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans using the gel-diffusion method. Active extracts were further evaluated to establish minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and antimicrobial profiles using bioautography on normal-phase thin-layer chromatography plates. Diclinanona calycina presented extracts with good antimicrobial activity and S. oralis and M. smegmatis were the most sensitive bacteria. D. calycina and Lacmellea gracilis presented extracts with the lowest MIC (48.8 microg/ml). D. calycina methanol and chloroform leaf extracts presented the best overall antimicrobial activity. All test organisms were sensitive to D. calycina branch chloroform extract in the bioautography assay. This is the first evaluation of the biological activity of these plant species and significant in vitro antimicrobial activity was detected in extracts and components from two species, D. calycina and L. gracilis.
TI  - Decontamination effects of low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge.  Part II: new insights.
AB  - The second part of our paper presents the results of experiments with the decontamination of surfaces by low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge in air at atmospheric pressure. A simple device is described and the effects of the corona discharge on model microorganisms, viz. the yeast Candida albicans, Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Neisseria sicca, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Gram-positive bacteria Deinococcus radiodurans, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and vegetative and spore forms of Geobacillus stearothermophilus are discussed. A similar microbicidal effect after about one-minute exposure was observed in all vegetative forms of the microorganisms. Measurement in growth inhibition zones on a semisolid medium was used to determine the dependence of the microbicidal effect on exposure time and the distance between electrodes. Counting of colonies served to assess the microbicidal effect of the discharge on contaminated inert surfaces observable after more than 1 min exposure. Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores were found to have several times lower susceptibility to the action of the discharge and the microbicidal effect was observed only after an 8 min exposure. Reaction with the iodide reagent did not unambiguously demonstrate the difference between ozone and singlet oxygen as presumed active components of the corona. The area distribution of reactive oxygen species was determined; it was found to differ from the Wartburg law depending on exposure time. Qualitative evidence was obtained on the penetration of the reactive oxygen species into the semisolid medium.
TI  - The utility of affinity-tags for detection of a streptococcal protein from a variety of streptococcal species.
AB  - There is no systematic examination of affinity tag utility in Gram-positive bacteria, which limits the investigation of protein function in this important group of bacteria as specific antibodies for many of native proteins are generally not available. In this study, we utilized an E. coli-streptococcal shuttle vector pVT1666 and constructed two sets of expression plasmids pVPT-CTag and pVPT-NTag, with each set containing five affinity tags (GST, GFP, HSV, T7 and Nano) that can be fused to either the C- or N-terminus of a target protein. A putative glycosyltransferase (Gtf2) essential for Fap1 glycosylation was used to demonstrate the utility of the cassettes in detection of Gtf2 fusion proteins, and the biological relevance of the proteins in our working strain Streptococcus parasanguinis. GFP and T7 tags were readily expressed in S. parasanguinis as either an N- or C-terminal fusion to Gtf2. Only the C- terminal fusion of GST and HSV were able to be identified in S. parasanguinis. The Nano tag was not detected in either E. coli or S. parasanguinis. Genetic complementation experiments indicated that all the tagged Gtf2 fusion proteins could restore the Gtf2 function in the null mutant except for the Nano-tagged Gtf2 at its N-terminal fusion. Using a T7-tagged Gtf2 fusion construct, we demonstrated that the fusion cassette is also useful in detection of the fusion tag expression in other streptococci including S. mutans, S. pneumoniae and S. sanguinis. Therefore, the expression cassettes we constructed will be a useful tool not only to investigate protein-protein interactions in Fap1 biogenesis in S. parasanguinis, but also to study protein functions in other gram-positive bacteria in which pVT1666 replicates.
TI  - Microcalorimetry: a novel method for detection of microbial contamination in platelet products.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Measuring heat from replicating microorganisms in culture may be a rapid, accurate, and simple screening method for platelets (PLTs). Microcalorimetry for detection of microorganisms in in vitro contaminated PLT products was evaluated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sanguinis, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, and Candida albicans were inoculated in single-donor apheresis PLTs to achieve target concentrations of 10(5), 10(3), 10, or 1 colony-forming units (CFU) per mL of PLTs. Contaminated PLTs in growth medium were incubated at 37 degrees C for 5 days in a calorimeter. Positivity was defined as heat flow of at least 10 microW above the lowest value of the power-time curve. RESULTS: With microcalorimetry, inocula of 10 CFUs per mL PLTs could be detected with the following detection times: S. epidermidis (31.65 hr), S. aureus (24.24 hr), S. sanguinis (7.82 hr), E. coli (7.53 hr), P. acnes (73.57 hr), and C. albicans (43.77 hr). The detection time was less than 4 hr at 10(5) CFUs per mL PLTs for S. aureus, S. sanguinis, and E. coli. Noncontaminated PLTs remained negative. The total heat ranged from 2.8 (S. sanguinis) to 8.3 J (E. coli). The shape of the power-time curve was species-specific and independent from the initial concentration of microorganisms. CONCLUSION: The detection limit of microcalorimetry was 1 to 10 CFUs per mL PLTs. Microcalorimetry is a promising novel method for detection of contaminated PLTs. Applying this method to all PLT products could reduce the frequency of transfusion-related sepsis and prolong the shelf life of PLTs.
TI  - Bacterial diversity in aortic aneurysms determined by 16S ribosomal RNA gene analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aortic aneurysms are common vascular conditions that cause considerable morbidity and mortality. Understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the condition remains limited. Recently, infection has been suggested as possible contributor in the development of the disease. The aim of the present study was to examine aortic aneurysms for the presence of bacterial DNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene, followed by cloning and sequencing. METHODS: Universal eubacterial primers were used to amplify 16S rRNA bacterial genes in 10 specimens from arterial walls of aortic aneurysms. Subsequently, PCR amplicons were cloned into Escherichia coli and sequencing of the cloned inserts was used to determine species identity or closest relatives by comparison with known sequences in GenBank. RESULTS: Sequences of Stenotrophomonas spp., including S. maltophilia (formerly Pseudomonas homology group V) were detected in six aneurysm samples. Propionibacterium acnes was identified in five samples, and Brevundimonas diminuta (formerly P. diminuta) in four samples. Other species previously assigned to the Pseudomonas genus such as Comamonas testosteroni, Delftia acidovorans, Burkholderia cepacia, Herbaspirillum sp., and Acidovorax sp. were also detected. Some clones fell into other environmental species, including Methylobacterium sp. and Bradyrhizobium elkanii, and others represented bacteria that have not yet been cultivated. DNA sequences from oral bacteria, including Streptococcus sanguinis, Tannerella forsythia, and Leptotrichia buccalis were detected. Sequences from Prevotella melaninogenica and Lactobacillus delbrueckii, which are commonly found in both mouth and gastrointestinal tract, were also detected. Additional species included Dermacoccus spp. and Corynebacterium vitaeruminis. CONCLUSIONS: A wide variety of bacteria, including oral bacteria, was found to colonize aortic aneurysms and may play a role in their development. Several of these microorganisms have not yet been cultivated. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although Chlamydophila pneumoniae has been detected in aneurysmal walls, its exact role in the condition remains inconclusive. Overall, there is scarce information about the role of microorganisms in aneurysmal disease. In the present study, we used molecular genetics to detect a diversity of bacteria in arterial walls of aortic aneurysms. The presence of multiple microorganisms in aneurysmal disease may have implications for chemoprophylaxis and antibiotic treatment if directed only at C.pneumoniae.
TI  - In vitro anti-microbial and in vivo cytokine modulating effects of different prepared Chinese herbal medicines.
AB  - The toxicity, antimicrobial and cytokine modulating effects of herbal medicines in treating periodontal diseases were evaluated in this study. Using the broth dilution method and disc agar diffusion test, in individual and combined decocted preparations, different concentrations of Ching-Wei-San and its individual herbal components, Coptidis rhizoma, Angelicae sinensis radix, Rehmanniae radixet rhizom, Moutan radicis cortex, and Cimicifuga foetida, were tested for in vitro inhibitory effects on three well-known plaque-causing bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivialis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus mutans, and two common pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The cytokine modulating effects were evaluated in Balb/c mice. The results suggested that one milliliter Ching-Wei-San at the 25,000 mg/mL concentration daily for the mice had significantly high levels in the liver function indexes in the 3-day acute toxicity test and in both the liver and kidney function indexes in the 28-day subacute toxicity test (P<0.01). The 250 mg/mL Ching-Wei-San is comparable to 250 mg/mL of tetracycline, and had similar inhibitory effects on the tested bacteria. Coptidis rhizoma (62.5 mg/mL) was the only individual herbal component to show 100% inhibitory effects. The mean cytokine ratios of IL-2, IL-4, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha in Balb/c mice treated with individual herbal components were shown to be different from each other. Ching-Wei-San modulated the immunity of mice, up-regulated IL-2, IL-4 and TNF-alpha, but down-regulated IFN-gamma. The effects of none of the individual herbal components alone can substitute for the cumulative effect of Ching-Wei-San.
TI  - T and NK cell subset changes with microbial extracts and human HSP60-derived peptides in Behcet's disease.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Microorganisms such as streptococcus and autoantigens such as 60 kD heat-shock protein (HSP60) are implicated in the etiopathogenesis of Behcet's disease (BD). METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with BD (n = 16) and healthy controls (HC) (n = 11) were cultured for 5 days with extracts of S. sanguis-KTH-1 (SS), E. coli (EC) and a mixed peptide combination from human HSP60 (aa 136-50, 179-97, 224-58 and 336-51) reported to be associated with BD. T and NK cell subset changes were determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: In unstimulated 5-day cultures gammadelta+ (both CD4+gammadelta+ and CD8+gammadelta+), CD8+alphabeta+, CD4+CD56+ and CD8+CD11b+ cells were increased in BD compared to HC. In antigen-stimulated cultures of BD patients CD3+ and alphabeta+ T cells responded to HSP60 peptides whereas EC stimulated only CD16/ CD56+ NK cells. In the control group, similar to BD, alphabeta+ and CD4+ T cells responded to HSP60 peptides, however SS and EC mainly activated cytotoxic T cell subsets (CD8+CD11b and CD4+CD56+ T cells). CONCLUSION: Significant increases in unstimulated T cell subsets suggest the presence of an in vivo T cell activation in BD. In both patients and controls similar patterns of responses were observed against different microorganisms, however the role of human HSP60 peptides as immunodominant, crossreactive antigens could not be demonstrated.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of a fusion protein of llama heavy-chain antibodies coupled  to glucose oxidase on oral bacteria.
AB  - Enzymes such as lactoperoxidase and glucose oxidase (GOx) are used as antimicrobial agents in oral care products. Their low specificities and substantiveness can be reduced by covalent coupling of antimicrobial molecules to antibodies. Variable domains (V(HH)) derived from llama heavy-chain antibodies are particularly suited for such an approach. The antibodies are composed solely of heavy-chain dimers; therefore, production of active fusion proteins by using molecular biology-based techniques is less complicated than production by use of conventional antibodies. In this study, a fusion protein consisting of V(HH) and GOx was constructed and expressed by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A llama was immunized with Streptococcus mutans strain HG982. Subsequently, B lymphocytes were isolated and cDNA fragments encoding the V(HH) fragments were obtained by reverse transcription-PCR. After construction of a V(HH) library in Escherichia coli and screening of the library against mutans group streptococci and Streptococcus sanguinis strains, we found two V(HH) fragments with high specificities for S. mutans strains. A GOx gene was linked to the two V(HH) genes and cloned into S. cerevisiae yeasts. The yeasts expressed and secreted the recombinant proteins into the growth medium. The test of binding of fusion proteins to oral bacteria through their V(HH) fragments showed that S. mutans had been specifically targeted by GOx-S120, one of the fusion protein constructs. A low concentration of the fusion protein was also able to selectively kill S. mutans within 20 min in the presence of lactoperoxidase and potassium iodide. These findings demonstrate that the fusion protein GOx-V(HH) is potentially valuable in the selective killing of target bacteria such as S. mutans.
TI  - The effects of chlorhexidine gluconate (0.12%) on the antimicrobial properties of tooth-colored ProRoot mineral trioxide aggregate.
AB  - The purpose of this in vitro study was to determine whether the substitution of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for sterile water as a mixing agent would enhance the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored ProRoot mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) against Actinomyces odontolyticus (ATCC17982), Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC2586), Streptococcus sanguis (ATCC10556), Enterococcus faecalis (ER3/2S), Escherichia coli (SM10lambdapir), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC6538), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (UME), and Candida albicans (ATCC10261). Two wells of 5-mm diameter were made in triplicate agar plates inoculated with standardized suspensions of each microorganism. MTA (33 mg) mixed with chlorhexidine (12 microl) or sterile water (12 microl) was placed to fill each well. Plates were incubated at 37 degrees C as required for microbial growth. A blinded, independent observer measured zones of inhibition. All MTA samples inhibited microbial growth regardless of mixing agent. MTA/chlorhexidine showed significantly larger zones of inhibition (p < 0.0002, paired t test). In conclusion, substituting 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for water enhanced the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored ProRoot MTA.
TI  - Selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. METHODS: A gradient plate technique was used to expose Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Neisseria subflava, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Prevotella nigrescens, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans and Veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations of triclosan. Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 was included as an organism showing the triclosan resistance development trait. MIC values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. RESULTS: N. subflava, Pr. nigrescens Po. gingivalis and E. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (MIC range 0.1-3.9 mg/L), whereas the lactobacillus and S. mutans were less susceptible (MIC range 15.6-20.8 mg/L). Triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (P < 0.01) for the positive control E. coli, although its MICs towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. Minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (MIC) occurred for Pr. nigrescens and in S. sanguis and S. oralis (MBC). Mean changes in susceptibilities (MIC and MBC) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine MBCs for S. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. CONCLUSIONS: These data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for E. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. Other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than FabI that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.
TI  - Lactoferrampin: a novel antimicrobial peptide in the N1-domain of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of bovine lactoferrin is attributed to lactoferricin,  situated in the N1-domain. Based on common features of antimicrobial peptides, a second putative antimicrobial domain was identified in the N1-domain of lactoferrin, designated lactoferrampin. This novel peptide exhibited candidacidal activity, which was substantially higher than the activity of lactoferrin. Furthermore, lactoferrampin was active against Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but not against the fermenting bacteria Actinomyces naeslundii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis. Notably, lactoferrampin is located in the N1-domain in close proximity to lactoferricin, which plays a crucial role in membrane-mediated activities of lactoferrin.
TI  - Biofilm-specific surface properties and protein expression in oral Streptococcus  sanguis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Oral streptococci are primary colonisers of the tooth surface and are  abundant in dental plaque biofilms. Bacteria growing in these relatively dense, surface-associated communities are phenotypically quite distinct from their planktonic counterparts. The purpose of the present study was to develop a method to investigate biofilm-specific surface protein expression by Streptococcus sanguis to help provide a better understanding of the critical events in plaque development. DESIGN: Biofilm cells were grown on the surface of glass beads in a biofilm device fed with mucin-containing artificial saliva. Planktonic cells were grown in continuous culture at approximately the same growth rate. Surface hydrophobicity of biofilm and planktonic cells was determined by hexadecane partitioning, and expression of streptococcal fibronectin adhesin CshA was determined in ELISA using specific antiserum. Antisera raised to glutaraldehyde-fixed whole biofilm or planktonic grown cells were used to screen an expression library of S. sanguis genomic DNA, and isolated clones were sequenced. RESULTS: Phenotypic analysis of biofilm and planktonic cells confirmed that mode of growth affected surface properties of S. sanguis. Thus, hydrophobicity and CshA expression was significantly elevated in biofilm cells. Library screening with biofilm antiserum yielded 32 recombinant clones representing 21 different S. sanguis proteins involved in adhesion and colonisation, carbohydrate utilisation or bacterial metabolism. In differential analysis of four selected Escherichia coli clones, biofilm antiserum reacted five times stronger than planktonic antiserum with cell-free extracts of clones encoding homologues of CshA and Cna collagen adhesin of Staphylococcus aureus, suggesting that these surface proteins are up-regulated in biofilm cells. In contrast, both antisera reacted equally strongly with cell-free extracts of the remaining two clones (encoding dihydrofolate synthase and an unknown protein). CONCLUSIONS: The method described represents a useful means for determining bacterial protein expression in biofilms based on a combination of molecular and immunological techniques. Surface expression of putative fibronectin and collagen adhesins was up-regulated in biofilm cells.
TI  - Viridans streptococcus bacteremia in children on chemotherapy for cancer: an underestimated problem.
AB  - The authors discuss the morbidity associated with viridans streptococcus bacteremia, and its implications on the choice of antibiotics used as prophylaxis and treatment. They retrospectively studied the case notes of 38 children who were being treated for various malignant conditions in their unit and developed 40 episodes of bacteremia with viridans streptococci between October 1995 and January 1999. Viridans streptococci were the third commonest blood culture isolate during this period, after coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus. The majority of the isolates were Streptococcus mitis (55%). Others were S. sanguis (25%), S. oralis (12.5%), S. salivarius (5%), and S. acidominimus (2.5%). Twenty-five percent of the patients had been treated with regimens that included cytosine arabinoside, 60% were receiving prophylactic co-trimoxazole, and 87.5% were neutropenic. Thirty percent of patients had abnormal chest X-rays, and 15% were hypotensive; 2 patients required admission to the intensive care unit. Initial antibiotic therapy was changed because of failure of clinical response in 60% of cases, despite the infecting organism being sensitive in vitro. This study confirms the importance of viridans streptococci as a cause of bacteremia in pediatric hematology and oncology patients, leading to significant morbidity. Further work is required to establish the optimal treatment for viridans streptococcus bacteremia.
TI  - The antimicrobial efficacy of 'MGP' gutta-percha in vitro.
AB  - AIM: To determine whether 'MGP' gutta-percha (Westport, CT, USA), a commercially  available gutta-percha containing iodoform, inhibits the growth of potential endodontic pathogens. METHODOLOGY: Inocula of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus sanguis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces odontolyticus were spread onto the surface of agar plates. 'MGP' gutta-percha cones presoaked in sterile water were transferred to the inoculated agar and incubated at 37 degrees C aerobically or anaerobically as required for optimal growth. Identical studies were performed using iodoform-free gutta-percha and sterile paper disks saturated with 10% povidone-iodine. Following incubation, zones of inhibition around the 'MGP' gutta-percha, iodoform-free gutta-percha and disks were evaluated. RESULTS: Povidone-iodine inhibited all the strains. Iodoform-free gutta-percha inhibited S. sanguis and A. odontolyticus. 'MGP' gutta-percha inhibited S. aureus, S. sanguis, A. odontolyticus and F. nucleatum. Neither iodoform-free gutta-percha nor 'MGP' gutta-percha inhibited growth of E. faecalis, E. coli or P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to iodoform-free gutta-percha, iodoform-containing 'MGP' gutta-percha had an inhibitory effect in vitro on S. aureus and F. nucleatum, but not on E. faecalis, E. coli or P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Defense mechanisms of urinary bladder: studies on antimicrobial polypeptides from bladder mucosa.
AB  - The acid-soluble extract of the bladder mucosal surface was obtained by washing out the bladder with dilute acetic acid in the presence of protease inhibitors. The wash-out materials from rats, rabbits, pigs, and humans manifested strong bactericidal activity against E. coli in vitro. The ultrafiltrate of the human material, which contained two major peptides with apparent molecular masses of 6.7 kD and 8.5 kD, respectively, showed potent bactericidal activity against E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus sanguis. Three antibacterial polypeptides (PiBPs) were purified from the porcine material. The molecular masses of PiBP-5, PiBP-11 and PiBP-25 were 5773.3 Da, 11127.8 Da and 25073 Da, respectively. PiBP-5 was unusually rich in glycine, serine and threonine residues (20.0, 16.3 and 10.4 mol%, respectively), and N-terminal amino acid sequencing revealed that PiBP-5 was homologous (83.3% identity in an 18 residue overlay) to the "tail" of human cytokeratin-7. Although the amino acid compositions of PiBP-11 and PiBP-25 were established, both had blocked N-termini and primary sequence data were not obtained. These results provided evidence indicating that the presence of peptides in the bladder mucosa could enable it to kill adherent bacteria.
TI  - [Expression of pyruvate oxidase gene sopox from Streptococcus sanguis in E. coli].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To reconstruct the expression plasmid of Sopox gene for further understanding the regulation of its expression. METHODS: Sopox was recombined with expression vector pBV220 and the expression of Sopox in E. coli JM105 was observed after transformation. RESULTS: pBV220/Sopox/JM105 expressed a protein with molecular weight of 65 kd on SDS-PAGE after induction, and the expression reached the maximal amount with induction at 42 degrees C for 4 hours. CONCLUSION: Sopox was successfully cloned into pBV220 and expressed in E. coli JM105.
TI  - Genetic and biochemical characterization of the F-ATPase operon from Streptococcus sanguis 10904.
AB  - Oral streptococci utilize an F-ATPase to regulate cytoplasmic pH. Previous studies have shown that this enzyme is a principal determinant of aciduricity in the oral streptococcal species Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans. Differences in the pH optima of the respective ATPases appears to be the main reason that S. mutans is more tolerant of low pH values than S. sanguis and hence pathogenic. We have recently reported the genetic arrangement for the S. mutans operon. For purposes of comparative structural biology we have also investigated the F-ATPase from S. sanguis. Here, we report the genetic characterization and expression in Escherichia coli of the S. sanguis ATPase operon. Sequence analysis showed a gene order of atpEBFHAGDC and that a large intergenic space existed upstream of the structural genes. Activity data demonstrate that ATPase activity is induced under acidic conditions in both S. sanguis and S. mutans; however, it is not induced to the same extent in the nonpathogenic S. sanguis. Expression studies with an atpD deletion strain of E. coli showed that S. sanguis-E. coli hybrid enzymes were able to degrade ATP but were not sufficiently functional to permit growth on succinate minimal media. Hybrid enzymes were found to be relatively insensitive to inhibition by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, indicating loss of productive coupling between the membrane and catalytic subunits.
TI  - A retrospective investigation of advanced periodontal disease as a risk factor for septicemia in hematopoietic stem cell and bone marrow transplant recipients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Septicemia is a cause of death in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. Extraction of teeth with advanced periodontitis has been advocated before HSCT to prevent septicemia in myeloablated hosts. The primary aim of the present study was to determine impact of chronic periodontitis, as measured by radiographic alveolar bone loss, on septicemia and transplant mortality. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective design was used to study 77 subjects who received pretransplant dental evaluation, panoramic radiography, and full myeloablative allogeneic HSCT to treat hematologic malignancies. Radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss was measured with a Schei ruler on all teeth. Microorganisms isolated from positive blood cultures within the first 100 days after transplant were categorized as of likely origin from periodontal, oral, or any body sites. Spearman correlation and logistic regression analysis assessed associations between positive blood cultures, mean subject whole-mouth percent radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss, and 100-day survival. RESULTS: Radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss per study subject averaged 13% +/- 7%, with 18.2% exhibiting bone loss of 20% or greater. During the initial 100 days after transplant, 63.6% subjects yielded septicemia-associated positive blood cultures, with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli as the most common isolates recovered. No statistically significant associations were found between mean subject radiographic alveolar bone loss and septicemia of likely periodontal or oral origin. CONCLUSION: In this preliminary study, no relationship was found between radiographic periodontal status and septicemia or mortality within the initial 100 days after transplant. A larger-sized, prospective study is warranted to further delineate the risk of septicemia from periodontal and other oral diseases in immunocompromised patients.
TI  - The antimicrobial properties of a urea-based handwash lotion with triclosan.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine and compare the antimicrobial action of a urea-based handwash lotion with triclosan with a lipid-depleting detergent-based handwash product with 4% chlorhexidine gluconate. The zones of inhibition produced by the two handwash lotions and the one produced by the positive control were similar against all strains of bacteria tested, indicating that a urea-based handwash lotion with triclosan is as effective as a lipid-depleting handwash lotion in inhibiting bacterial activity.
TI  - Initial characterization of the Streptococcus gordonii htpX gene.
AB  - Examination of the Streptococcus gordonii chromosomal region, which lies immediately upstream of the glucosyltransferase positive regulatory determinant rgg, revealed two open reading frames. Based on nucleotide sequences, these genes were similar to the Listeria monocytogenes lemA gene, which is involved in antigen presentation, and the Escherichia coli htpX heat shock gene, which has an unknown function. Northern hybridization analysis indicated that S. gordonii lemA and htpX genes were associated with a ca. 1.7-kb polycistronic transcript. Although levels of the lemA/htpX transcript did not increase in response to heat to levels seen with dnaK controls, insertional inactivation of htpX resulted in changes in adhesiveness, cellular morphology and detergent-extractable surface antigens in cells grown at 41 degrees C, implying that htpX may be involved in surface protein expression. Insertional inactivation of lemA and htpX indicated that, despite their proximity to rgg and the structural gene, gtfG, these upstream genes do not affect S. gordonii glucosyltransferase activity.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers against endodontic pathogens.
AB  - The antibacterial effects of various types of widely used endodontic sealers have not been compared systematically on facultative or obligate anaerobic endodontic pathogens. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of four commonly used endodontic sealers: two epoxy-resin-based sealers (AH26, AH plus), one zinc-oxide eugenol-based sealer (N2), and one calcium hydroxide-based sealer (Sealapex). The testing microbes were four facultative anaerobic species (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus) and four obligate anaerobic species (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella intermedia). The freshly mixed sealers were placed into the prepared wells of agar plates inoculated with the test microorganisms. After varying periods of incubation (2 days for facultative anaerobic species and 7 days for obligate anaerobic species), the zones of growth inhibition were observed and measured. All the sealers were distinctly different from each other in their antimicrobial activity. The sealers showed different inhibitory effects depending on the types and bacterial strains. N2 containing formaldehyde and eugenol proved to be the most effective against the microorganisms. The extreme antimicrobial potency of this root canal sealer must be weighted against its pronounced tissue toxic effect.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Hydrastis canadensis extract and its major isolated alkaloids.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of extract and isolated major alkaloids (berberine, beta-hydrastine, canadine and canadaline) of Hydrastis canadensis L. (Ranunculaceae) was evaluated against 6 strains of microorganism: Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25 993 and ATCC 6538P), Streptococcus sanguis (ATCC 10 556), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25 922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27 853). Bactericidal activity was evaluated by contact test by measuring the "killing time" on a low density bacterial inoculum, and bacteriostatic activity in liquid medium by M.I.C. values. The results provide a rational basis for the traditional antibacterial use of Hydrastis canadensis.
TI  - The effect of oral bacteria on Candida albicans germ-tube formation.
AB  - A total of eight bacterial isolates belonging to six species, and a select group  of 12 oral Candida albicans isolates, were used to study the effect of bacteria on germ-tube formation. Briefly, each bacterial suspension (10(5-6) cells/ml) was mixed with a C. albicans suspension (10(7) cells/ml) and incubated at 37 degrees C for 90 min with bovine serum, and the percentage germ-tube-positive Candida cells was quantified using a haemocytometer, under light microscopy. In general, out of eight bacteria, Streptococcus sanguis SK21A, Streptococcus salivarius SK56, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and S. salivarius OBU3 suppressed germ-tube formation to varying degrees, with different C albicans isolates. Porphyromonas gingivalis Pg 50, Lactobacillus casei ATCC 7469 and Prevotella intermedia OBU4 elicited significant enhancement of germ-tube formation, whereas S. sanguis OBU 2 had no effect. E. coli ATCC 25922 was the only organism to show statistically significant suppression of germ-tube formation (p=0.0312). A significant increase in the germ tube production of C. albicans isolated from HIV-infected compared with HIV-free individuals was also noted. The current results tend to suggest that commensal and transient oral bacterial populations may selectively influence the differential expression of germ-tube-forming ability of C. albicans isolates.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of histidine-rich polypeptides in human parotid saliva].
AB  - Two ultrasensitive antibacterial assays were applied to determine the antibacterial activity of histidine-rich polypeptides (HRPs) in human parotid saliva. The results not only confirmed the potent antibacterial activity of HRPs against Streptococcus mutans MT6R, but also showed for the first time that HRPs were effectively antibacterial to Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ML-35p and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Among HRPs, HRP3, HRP5 and HRP6 were the major antibacterial components which were active against S. mutans, S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, whereas HRP1 was only effective against E. coli. S. sanguis was resistant to the action of HRPs. These results suggest that HRPs are actually a family of endogenous antibiotic peptides with broad antimicrobial spectrum including fungi, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and may play an important role in the prevention of various infection diseases in the oral cavity as well as in the resistance to caries.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria from healthy oral cavity of Thai volunteers: inhibition of oral pathogens.
AB  - The aims of the present study were to screen and characterize the antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria which were isolated from healthy oral cavities of Thai volunteers, and to characterize their inhibiting substances. Among 3790 isolates (suspected to be lactic acid bacteria) from 130 volunteers, five showed an appreciable effect against Sarcina lutea ATCC 9341, Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Streptococcus mutans DTMU 1, Strep. salivarius DTMU 1, Strep. sanguis DTMU 1, Candida albicans ATCC 13803 and C. albicans DTMU 2, as well as the oral pathogens. These antimicrobial isolates included L17 and N14 which showed the antibacterial activity, D14 which showed the anticandidal activity, and D6 and N8 which showed both the antibacterial and anticandidal activities. The isolates were later found to be facultative anaerobic, Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-capsule-forming and catalase-negative bacilli. They could utilize casein but could not hydrolyse starch, and they produced hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins. Their antimicrobial potentials were found to be affected by pH, catalase, proteolytic enzymes and temperature. The activity was partially inactivated after catalase treatment, significantly declined at pH > or =9.0 or after trypsin and pepsin treatments, and also reduced after heating at > or =100 degrees C. However, the antimicrobial activity of these five isolates was somewhat resistant to heat. When the isolates were tested for their antimicrobial sensitivity, they were shown to be sensitive to a number of antimicrobial agents. The final identification revealed that D6, D14 and N14 were Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, and L17 and N8 were Lact. rhamnosus.
TI  - Effect of the interleukin-1 genotype on monocyte IL-1beta expression in subjects  with adult periodontitis.
AB  - An association has been reported between polymorphisms in the genes encoding IL-1alpha (-889) and IL-1beta (+3953) (periodontitis susceptibility trait, PST), and an increased severity of periodontitis (18). The IL-1beta polymorphism was reported to correlate with increased IL-1beta expression by monocytes in response to bacterial stimulants. In the present study, we determined if PST positive subjects with periodontitis exhibit elevated production of IL-1beta, compared to PST negative periodontitis patients. Peripheral blood monocytes were obtained from 10 PST+ and 10 PST- age- and disease-balanced subjects with adult forms of periodontitis. Monocytes were cultured with a panel of bacterial stimulants, including Escherichia coli and Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS, and whole formalinized periodontal pathogens P. gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus and Prevotella intermedia, and health-associated organisms Veillonella parvula and Streptococcus sanguis. Our results demonstrate that monocytes from PST+ and PST- patients showed no significant differences in IL-1beta production in response to any stimulant tested. In addition, the periodontal pathogens P. gingivalis, B. forsythus and P. intermedia failed to stimulate higher IL-1beta responses compared to health-associated species V. parvula and S. sanguis. A marked interindividual variation in production of IL-1beta was seen, with high, low and intermediate responders present in both PST+ and PST- groups. We conclude that genetic loci other than the PST polymorphisms are also important regulators of monocyte IL-1 responses.
TI  - Epithelial cell response to challenge of bacterial lipoteichoic acids and lipopolysaccharides in vitro.
AB  - Accumulating dental plaque at the gingival margin contains lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) from the cell walls of gram-positive bacteria. In subgingival plaque associated with periodontal disease the amount of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) from gram-negative bacteria increases. As the gingival junctional epithelium (JE) is an important structural and functional tissue, participating in the first line defence against apical advancement of dental plaque, this study examined the direct effects of LTAs (from Streptococcus mutans and S. sanguis) and LPSs (from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola and Escherichia coli) on two epithelial cell lines (HaCaT and ERM) and a culture model for human JE. The cells were exposed to the LTAs or LPSs (10-50 microg/ml) for variable periods of time. None of the bacterial surface components had any effect on primary adhesion or on the epithelial attachment of the JE cultures. However, cell growth and mitotic activity were consistently reduced in all cultures treated with LTAs. In contrast, LPSs showed only slight or no effects on cell growth and mitotic activity depending on the epithelial cells used. This suggests that LPSs, despite their established role as modulators of inflammation, do not have direct harmful effects - at the concentrations found in dental plaque and gingival crevicular fluid - which would explain the mechanism of epithelial degeneration and detachment from the tooth surface. However, the LTAs appear to inhibit the renewal of epithelium and may thus contribute to degeneration of coronal JE and subgingival colonisation by periodontal pathogens.
TI  - An evaluation of the action of different root canal irrigants on facultative aerobic-anaerobic, obligate anaerobic, and microaerophilic bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to test the effect of different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, and cetrimide on the following bacterial strains: Facultative aerobes-anaerobes: Candida albicans ATCC 10231; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212; Escherichia coli ATCC 25,922; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27,853; Streptococcus mitis ATCC 9811; Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35668; Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419; and Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556. Microaerophiles: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 29522. Obligate anaerobes: Actinomyces odontolyticus ATCC 17929; Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25,586; Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277; and Prevotella melaninogenica ATCC 25845. Each irrigant was kept in contact with the bacterial species used for the experiment for 10, 20, or 30 min. Results showed that all irrigants had a bactericidal effect on both facultative aerobes-anaerobes and on microaerophilic and obligate anaerobic strains, in all concentrations and even after short periods of contact.
TI  - Cure of implantable venous port-associated bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology-oncology patients without catheter removal.
AB  - The efficacy of antibiotic treatment of port-associated bloodstream infection without device removal has not been systematically studied. We analyzed the outcome of 43 consecutive port-associated bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology-oncology patients. Etiologies included Staphylococcus epidermidis (30) and Staphylococcus aureus (6). Antibiotics were given through the port for a median of 11 days. Four ports were removed within 72 hours. In 36 (92%) of the remaining 39 episodes, there was a response to antibiotic therapy (defervescence and negative blood culture). In 78% of episodes in which there was a response (excluding two in which the catheters were removed because of mechanical problems), the infections were cured without port removal. Two of the four relapses were cured with a second course of antibiotics. The cure rate was 92% for S. epidermidis infections and 67% for S. aureus infections. Thus, the majority of port-associated bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology-oncology patients can be cured without device removal.
TI  - Increased levels of transforming growth factor beta 1 and basic fibroblast growth factor in patients on CAPD: a study during non-infected steady state and peritonitis.
AB  - Long-term influence of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) on concentrations of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in the peritoneal effluent, and the effect of peritonitis on these cytokines were investigated. TGF-beta1 and bFGF were assayed in effluent samples from dialysate bags collected during the initial week of treatment with CAPD and at 5 months. To determine the effect of peritonitis, dialysate bags were collected on admission to the hospital and on days 3 and 10 and also during non-infected steady state. Serum was drawn prior to infection and on days 1 and 10. TGF-beta1 increased more than threefold during the longitudinal follow-up period, median concentrations of 35 pg/ml to 106 pg/ml (P<0.05). No change in bFGF was seen during this initial 5 months. TGF-beta1 was increased on the first day of peritonitis (median concentration 169 pg/ml) and reached its maximum on day 3 of infection, (median concentration 216 pg/ml) (P<0.05 vs non-infected state, median concentration 39 pg/ml). Basic FGF reached a maximum on day three of infection (median concentration 7.7 pg/ml; P=0.01 vs non-infected state) and then slowly declined. In conclusion, TGF-beta1 is influenced by CAPD treatment per se, and together with bFGF is increased during peritonitis, indicating its importance in the peritoneum and its potential involvement in the development of tissue fibrosis and eventually ultrafiltration failure.
TI  - Anaerobic killing of oral streptococci by reduced, transition metal cations.
AB  - Reduced, transition metal cations commonly enhance oxidative damage to cells caused by hydroperoxides formed as a result of oxygen metabolism or added externally. As expected, the cations Fe2+ and Cu+ enhanced killing of Streptococcus mutans GS-5 by hydroperoxides. However, unexpectedly, they also induced lethal damage under fully anaerobic conditions in a glove box with no exposure to O2 or hydroperoxides from initial treatment with the cations. Sensitivities to anaerobic killing by Fe2+ varied among the organisms tested. The oral streptococci Streptococcus gordonii ATCC 10558, Streptococcus rattus FA-1, and Streptococcus sanguis NCTC 10904 were approximately as sensitive as S. mutans GS-5. Enterococcus hirae ATCC 9790, Actinomyces viscosus OMZ105E, and Actinomyces naeslundii WVU45 had intermediate sensitivity, while Lactobacillus casei ATCC 4646 and Escherichia coli B were insensitive. Killing of S. mutans GS-5 in response to millimolar levels of added Fe2+ occurred over a wide range of temperatures and pH. The organism was able to take up ferrous iron, but ferric reductase activity could not be detected. Chelators, uric acid, and thiocyanate were not effective inhibitors of the lethal damage. Sulfhydryl compounds, ferricyanide, and ferrocyanide were protective if added prior to Fe2+ exposure. Fe2+, but not Fe3+, acted to reduce the acid tolerance of glycolysis by intact cells of S. mutans. The reduction in acid tolerance appeared to be related directly to Fe2+ inhibition of F-ATPase, which could be assayed with permeabilized cells, isolated membranes, or F1 enzyme separated from membranes. Cu+ and Cu2+ also inhibited F-ATPase and sensitized glycolysis by intact cells to acid. All of these damaging actions occurred anaerobically and thus did not appear to involve reactive oxygen species.
TI  - Exclusion of bioactive contaminations in Streptococcus pyogenes erythrogenic toxin A preparations by recombinant expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The streptococcal erythrogenic exotoxin A (SPEA) belongs to the family of bacterial superantigens and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a toxic shock-like syndrome and scarlet fever. Concerning its biological activity, mainly T-cell-stimulatory properties, conflicting data exist. In this study, we show that most of the SPEA preparations used so far contain biologically active contaminations. Natural SPEA from the culture supernatant of Streptococcus pyogenes NY-5 and recombinant SPEA purified from the culture filtrate of S. sanguis are strongly contaminated with DNases. We show that natural SPEA induces more tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) than recombinant SPEA, but we also show that DNases are able to induce TNF-alpha. In commercial SPEA preparations, we identified a highly active protease, which was shown not to be SPEB. To exclude these contaminations, we overexpressed SPEA cloned in the effective high-level expression vector pIN-III-ompA2 in Escherichia coli. The expressed SPEA shows the same amino acid composition as natural SPEA, whereas functional studies reported so far were carried out with toxins containing an incorrect amino terminus. We describe the rapid purification of lipopolysaccharide-, DNase-, and protease-free SPEA in two steps from the host's periplasm and its structural characterization by circular dichroism. Our results represent for the first time the production in E. coli of recombinant SPEA with the authentic N-terminal sequence and a proven superantigenic activity. Collectively, our results indicate that immunological studies of superantigens require highly purified substances free of biologically active contaminations.
TI  - Ribotyping of bacteria from root canal and blood of patients receiving endodontic therapy.
AB  - DNA restriction patterns and corresponding ribotypes of 26 bacterial isolates (Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus intermedius, and Streptococcus sanguis) recovered from patients with infected root canals and their peripheral blood, collected during and after endodontic therapy, were examined. Eleven additional reference strains including type strains were also examined. Purified DNA was digested with BglI,EcoRI, and HindIII. Hybridization was carried out with a digoxigenin-labeled cDNA probe obtained by reverse transcription of Escherichia coli 16S + 23S rRNA. Ribotypes of the bacteria recovered from root canal and blood showed identical characteristics within the patients, and differed between the patients. The results were confirmed when the similarity coefficient (S(AB)) of the ribotypes from the isolates were assessed by the Dendron computer-assisted system. These results suggested that the bacteria isolated from the blood originated from the root canal.
TI  - Thermophysiology of Streptococcus mutans and related lactic-acid bacteria.
AB  - The temperature ranges for growth of Streptococcus mutans GS-5 and S. sobrinus 6715 were found to be very narrow, from about 30 to 47 degrees C, with optimal growth around 37 degrees C. Thus, the organisms showed little potential to grow in the environment outside of the animal host. In contrast wider ranges were found for Enterococcus hirae, S. rattus and S. sanguis. Detailed study of S. mutans GS-5 showed that energetic coupling, reflected in yields of biomass per mol of glucose utilized, were not greatly affected by changes in temperature within the growth range. However, since glycolysis occurred over a wider temperature range (about 10 to 52 degrees C) than growth, yield values dropped to zero at temperatures above or below the growth range. The temperature range for glycolysis could be related to temperature sensitivity of the phosphoenolypyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system for sugar uptake. F-ATPases were active over a similar range of temperatures, but with a broad optimal range from about 30 to 50 degrees C. Proton permeability of S. mutans increased steadily with temperature in a manner similar to that of other mesophilic bacteria, such as Escherichia coli. Growth of the bacteria in media supplemented with various fatty acids had major effects on proton permeabilities but the effects were not well reflected by changes in growth or glycolysis of the bacteria. The overall conclusions were that S. mutans is a typical mesophile in relation to membrane and catabolic functions but its narrow temperature range for growth is related to temperature sensitivities of anabolic systems.
TI  - Extracts of Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans inhibit alkaline phosphatase activity in osteoblastic cells in vitro.
AB  - In order to study the effects of sonicated extracts from Prevotella intermedia, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and other oral-related bacteria, as well as Escherichia coli on bone formation, clone MC3T3-E1 cells, which have retained osteoblastic activity, were cultured with various bacterial extracts. The addition of the sonicated extracts from Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans decreased the alkaline phosphatase activity in a dose-dependent fashion over the concentration range of 1-1000 ng ml-1 compared with the control. By contrast, the sonicated extracts from other oral bacteria including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Streptococcus milleri and Streptococcus sanguis, and Escherichia coli did not decrease the alkaline phosphatase activity even in the presence of 100 ng ml-1 protein. The addition of Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans extracts that had been treated with heat and trypsin to the cell cultures also inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity in the cells, suggesting that inhibitory factors are not proteinaceous. Polymyxin B did not change the alkaline phosphatase activity in the cells treated with the extracts from Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, suggesting that the inhibitory activity of the extracts is not lipopolysaccharide. The inhibitory effect of both extracts was observed in the molecular mass over 290 kDa eluted from Sephadex G-200 column. The inhibitory substances of Prevotella intermedia were partially purified and showed broad band with estimated molecular weight of 170-190 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These results indicate that Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans may play an important role in inhibiting bone formation as well as in stimulating bone resorption.
TI  - Disruption of the gene encoding penicillin-binding protein 2b (pbp2b) causes altered cell morphology and cease in exopolysaccharide production in Streptococcus thermophilus Sfi6.
AB  - Genetic and biochemical analysis of exopolysaccharide (EPS) production in lactic  acid bacteria has been a growing field of interest in the food industry. We previously identified and characterized a gene cluster composed of 13 genes (epsA to epsM) responsible for EPS production in Streptococcus thermophilus Sfi6. Here we report one further gene, pbp2b, that is connected to EPS production. Mutants with a gene disruption in pbp2b were no longer able to produce EPS, exhibited a reduced growth-rate, and their cell morphology was altered. The predicted gene product showed significant homology to the class B penicillin-binding proteins 2b of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mitis involved in peptidoglycan synthesis. Upstream of pbp2b, we further identified two genes which showed significant homology to the E. coli folD and urfl, which is an unidentified open reading frame presumed to be involved in DNA repair. Downstream of pbp2b, we identified a gene that showed homology to the Bacillus subtilis and the Escherichia coli recM or recR which, respectively, are involved in the methyl-dependent DNA mismatch repair. In S. thermophilus, pbp2b and recM were transcribed from their own promoters as monocistronic mRNAs and are therefore organized as independent transcriptional units.
TI  - Characterization of the Streptococcus pneumoniae immunoglobulin A1 protease gene  (iga) and its translation product.
AB  - Bacterial immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1) proteases constitute a very heterogenous group of extracellular endopeptidases which specifically cleave human IgA1 in the hinge region. Here we report that the IgA1 protease gene, iga, of Streptococcus pneumoniae is homologous to that of Streptococcus sanguis. By using the S. sanguis iga gene as hybridization probe, the corresponding gene from a clinical isolate of S. pneumoniae was isolated in an Escherichia coli lambda phage library. A lysate of E. coli infected with hybridization-positive recombinant phages possessed IgA1-cleaving activity. The complete sequence of the S. pneumoniae iga gene was determined. An open reading frame with a strongly biased codon usage and having the potential of encoding a protein of 1,927 amino acids with a molecular mass of 215,023 Da was preceded by a potential -10 promoter sequence and a putative Shine-Dalgarno sequence. A putative signal peptide was found in the N-terminal end of the protein. The amino acid sequence similarity to the S. sanguis IgA1 protease indicated that the pneumococcal IgA1 protease is a Zn-metalloproteinase. The primary structures of the two streptococcal IgA1 proteases were quite different in the N-terminal parts, and both proteins contained repeat structures in this region. Using a novel assay for IgA1 protease activity upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we demonstrated that the secreted IgA1 protease was present in several different molecular forms ranging in size from approximately 135 to 220 kDa. In addition, interstrain differences in the sizes of the pneumococcal IgA1 proteases were detected. Southern blot analyses suggested that the S. pneumoniae iga gene is highly heterogenous within the species.
TI  - The effect of oral commensal bacteria on candidal adhesion to human buccal epithelial cells in vitro.
AB  - The effect of Streptococcus sanguis, S. salivarius, Escherichia coli and Porphyromonas gingivalis on the adhesion of Candida albicans and C. krusei to human buccal epithelial cells (BEC) was investigated with a modified membrane filter system. The filters (12 microns diameter pores) acted as a support for the BEC which were pre-exposed to known concentrations of bacterial suspensions (for 45 min-1 h), and then re-incubated with standardised concentrations of yeast suspensions for various periods. The BEC with adherent yeasts were then transferred on to a glass slide, gram-stained and counted by light microscopy. Three of the four bacterial species significantly suppressed adhesion of C. albicans to BEC; S. sanguis had no effect. Both S. sanguis and S. salivarius suppressed adhesion of C. krusei to BEC pre-exposed to three different bacterial concentrations, although variable results were obtained with P. gingivalis and E. coli. Significant differences in the relative adhesion of C. albicans and C. krusei to BEC were also recorded. These results indicate that the adhesion of yeasts to BEC is modulated both by the composition and the quantity of the pre-existing bacterial flora on the BEC.
TI  - The effect of oral commensal bacteria on candidal adhesion to denture acrylic surfaces. An in vitro study.
AB  - The effect of four different species of oral bacteria (Streptococci (X 2); Escherichia; Porphyromonas) on the adhesion of Candida albicans and Candida krusei to denture acrylic surfaces was studied using a previously described in vitro adhesion assay. Clear acrylic strips immersed in known concentrations of bacterial suspensions and incubated for 45 min to 1 h, at 37 degrees C, were transferred to yeast suspensions of known concentrations and incubated for a similar period, and the adherent yeasts were quantified using an image analysis system. Pre-exposure to different bacterial concentrations resulted in suppression of candidal adhesion to varying degrees. Of three selected concentrations, exposure to the highest bacterial concentration (10(6) organisms/ml) resulted in a consistent reduction in candidal adhesion, except for E. coli-C. albicans and S. salivarius-C. albicans combinations. Candidal adhesion was significantly reduced on pre-exposure to S. sanguis and P. gingivalis, but not E. coli. There were also significant differences in relative adhesion between C. albicans and C. krusei. Taken together, these results indicate that the adhesion of yeasts to acrylic strips is modulated both by the quantity and the quality of pre-existing bacterial flora on acrylic surfaces.
TI  - Overproduction and characterization of the StsI restriction endonuclease.
AB  - The StsI restriction endonuclease (R-StsI), a class-IIS restriction endonuclease, found in Streptococcus sanguis 54, is a heteroschizomer of R-FokI, which recognizes 5'-GGATG-3'. To overproduce R-StsI in Escherichia coli, the coding region of R-StsI was joined to the tac promoter of an expression vector, pKK223-3. By introduction of the plasmid into E. coli UT481 cells expressing the fokIM gene, R-StsI activity was overproduced, from which R-StsI was purified homogeneously. We compared the properties of R-StsI with those of R-FokI. The optimum reaction conditions for R-StsI were quite different fron those for R-FokI. R-StsI is an acidic protein (pI 6.3). Anti-R-StsI serum did not cross-react with R-FokI, indicating three-dimensional structural dissimilarity. The domain structure of R-StsI was elucidated by digestion with trypsin. In the presence of substrate DNA, R-StsI was digested to yield 45-kDa N-terminal and 23-kDa C-terminal fragments. The amino-acid sequences around the trypsin cleavage sites of R-StsI and R-FokI were quite homologous.
TI  - Insertional inactivation of binding determinants of Streptococcus crista CC5A using Tn916.
AB  - Intermicrobial binding plays an important role in the ecology of the oral cavity  because it represents one mechanism by which specific bacteria colonize dental plaque. The formation of "corncobs", a morphologically distinct microbial unit composed of Streptococcus crista and Fusobacterium nucleatum, is a highly specific binding interaction that depends on the presence of polar tufts of fimbriae on the streptococci. We have used a genetic approach to examine the role of streptococcal cell surface components involved in the binding of S. crista to F. nucleatum. Such binding may be an important component of corncob formation. A method for the genetic transformation of S. crista was used to transfer the broad host range transposon, Tn916, into the bacteria. Cells were grown to early log phase in brain heart infusion broth containing 10% fetal calf serum. The competent cells were mixed with purified DNA from pDL916, a plasmid construct consisting of Tn916 and the streptococcal/Escherichia coli shuttle vector pDL278. Over 300 transformants were screened for a reduction in binding to F. nucleatum. Five of the transformants showed a change in binding ranging from 59% to 29% of the positive control values. Southern blots revealed that the binding-deficient transformants contained the Tn916 element integrated into one of 4 different sites in the chromosome. The transposon, integrated into 4 different sites, appeared to be stable in the absence of selective pressure. Based on these findings, it appears that some strains of S. crista are naturally competent and that insertional inactivation methods can be used to facilitate the study of binding receptors in this group of oral streptococci.
TI  - The fimA locus of Streptococcus parasanguis encodes an ATP-binding membrane transport system.
AB  - The gene encoding fimA, a 36 kDa fimbrial adhesion of Streptococcus parasanguis FW213, is highly conserved in all four genetic groups of sanguis streptococci. FimA-like peptides were produced by all strains tested. The nucleotide sequence directly upstream of fimA contains two open reading frames, ORF5 and ORF1, whose deduced protein products are homologous to members of a superfamily of ATP-binding cassette membrane transport proteins, including both prokaryotic and eukaryotic uptake and export systems. The amino acid sequence of FimA contains the consensus prolipoprotein cleavage site (LxxC) common to the 'periplasmic' binding proteins of Gram-positive transport systems. The deduced product of ORF5 is a 28.6 kDa membrane-associated protein that has the consensus binding site for ATP (GxxGxGKS). It shares significant homology with AmiE of Streptococcus pneumoniae as well as with Escherichia coli proteins involved in iron(III) uptake. Allelic-replacement mutagenesis of ORF5 resulted in greatly increased resistance to aminopterin. These data demonstrate functionality with the amiE locus as well. The deduced product of ORF1 is an extremely hydrophobic integral membrane protein of 30.8 kDa with a pattern of six potential membrane-spanning regions, typical of a component of these types of transport system. The nucleotide sequence downstream of fimA, ORF3, encodes a 20 kDa protein having 78% identity with the 20 kDa protein encoded downstream of ssaB, a fimA homologue in S. sanguis 12. It also exhibits significant homology with bacterioferritin co-migratory protein (Bcp) of E. coli K-12. Allelic-replacement mutagenesis in the fimA locus of FW213 showed that (i) expression of fimA was initiated at a site far upstream of the fimA start codon, and (ii) expression of fimA was not linked to expression of ORF3. Northern blots probed with internal fragments of ORF5, ORF1, fimA or ORF3 hybridized to the same transcript of 3.3 kb, which suggested that these loci were transcribed as a polycistronic message. The ORF3 probe also hybridized to a 540 bp transcript consistent with the size of ORF3 alone and supportive of the mutagenesis data of non-linkage. Strains mutated in fimA continued to produce fimbriae, indicating that FimA was not the fimbrial structural subunit. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed FimA was localized at the tips of the fimbriae of FW213. This is the first study that demonstrates that an adhesin which binds a bacterial cell to a substrate is associated with an ATP-binding cassette.
TI  - Identification of intracellular amylase activity in Streptococcus bovis and Streptococcus salivarius.
AB  - The ruminal bacterium Streptococcus bovis has been demonstrated to produce an extracellular amylase activity. We previously reported on the cloning of a gene from S. bovis encoding for what was initially believed to be the extracellular amylase. DNA sequence analyses indicated that the amylase produced by the cloned gene did not match the N-terminus amino acid sequence of the purified extracellular amylase and contained no apparent leader sequence for secretion. Analyses of crude extracts demonstrated the presence of an intracellular amylase in S. bovis JB1 that differed in molecular weight (56,000) from that of the extracellular amylase (70,000). The 56,000 molecular weight amylase was identical to the amylase produced by Escherichia coli containing the cloned amylase gene. Low levels of intracellular amylase activity were also detected in other strains of S. bovis and also Streptococcus salivarius. Introduction of the plasmid pVA838 containing the cloned amylase gene into S. bovis and S. sanguis resulted in enhanced intracellular amylase production by both organisms. The amylase gene has been sequenced, and analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence for the amylase indicates a high degree of similarity with secreted amylases from Bacillus species.
TI  - Heterologous expression of an endoglucanase gene (endA) from the ruminal anaerobe Ruminococcus flavefaciens 17 in Streptococcus bovis and Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - The heterologous expression of a cloned endoglucanase gene (endA) from the ruminal bacterium Ruminococcus flavefaciens 17 was demonstrated in the Streptococcus species S. bovis JB1 and S. sanguis DL1. The endA gene was introduced into S. bovis and S. sanguis using the Escherichia coli/Streptococcus shuttle vector pVA838. Expression of the gene was detected by clearing zones around the recombinant colonies on agar plates containing carboxymethylcellulose stained with Congo red. S. bovis JB1 containing the endA gene was capable of utilizing cellotetraose at a faster rate than the parent strain. This is the first demonstration that Streptococcus species can express a gene from a Ruminococcus flavefaciens strain.
TI  - Cloning of an Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis antigen: homology with adhesins  from some oral streptococci.
AB  - Serum from a patient with Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis was used to identify the gene efaA cloned in Lambda ZapII in Escherichia coli. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a 924-bp open reading frame encoding a protein with a predicted molecular weight of 34,768. The amino acid sequence of EfaA shows 55 to 60% homology to a group of streptococcal proteins, FimA from Streptococcus parasanguis, SsaB from Streptococcus sanguis, ScaA from Streptococcus gordonii, and PsaA from Streptococcus pneumoniae. Members of this group have been shown to be adhesins, and we hypothesize that EfaA may function as an adhesin in endocarditis.
TI  - Transformation of naturally competent Streptococcus mutans with replicative and non-replicative Tn916-containing plasmids: implications for a mechanism of transposition.
AB  - Based on the observations reported here and what is known concerning transformation of naturally competent strains of S. mutans and other streptococcal species such as S. gordonii, we propose the model shown in Figure 2. The Tn916-intermediate transforms S. mutans as originally proposed for B. subtilis by Scott and coworkers [8]. It is not clear in either system (B. subtilis or S. mutans) whether the Tn916 intermediate enters the cell as ds-DNA or ss-DNA. Because it is likely that transformation of B. subtilis via formation of protoplasts involves a mechanism quite different from natural transformation in S. mutans, it would be unwise to extrapolate findings from their studies. If Tn916 enters S. mutans in a manner similar to plasmid or chromosomal DNA, we would assume that Tn916 binds to a cell receptor and as one strand enters, the other is degraded [9]. This leaves open the question of whether Tn916 recircularizes as ds-DNA before it inserts into the chromosome or whether it remains as ss-DNA, if, indeed, it enters as ss-DNA. The transformation efficiency for the Tn916 intermediate (approximately 10(-7) precluded kinetics studies such as those performed with pAM118. Poyart-Salmeron and coworkers [11] however, described a model in which Tn1545 inserts into the target site as a ds-DNA circular molecule, similar to that seen with lambda phage. Perhaps the most interesting finding presented here is that the predominant mechanism of insertion of Tn916 into the chromosome of the recipient occurs after Tn916 enters the cell. The replicative plasmid pAM118 evidently forms by two-hit kinetics followed by intracellular excision and transposition of Tn916. The helper-rescue experiment shows that in this system, the formation of Tcr transformants, and hence the integration of Tn916, was a function of the transformation efficacy of plasmid pAM118. Since intracellular excision of Tn916 probably follows the re-formation of the plasmid pAM118, the rate-limiting step in this system would be the formation of the transient, intracellular plasmid pAM118. (The transient white colony phenotype probably denotes the slower growth rate of transformants that acquire the large replicative plasmid pAM118). Our findings demonstrate that a practical way of promoting Tn916 insertions into chromosomal DNA for the purpose of obtaining mutations is to use a helper-rescue system. Our model supports the concept that the majority of Tn916 inserts arise from a mechanism similar to 'zygotic induction' as proposed for S. sanguis (gordonii) [1]. However, the frequencies for the co-establishment of the replicative plasmid (Emr) and Tn916 inserts (Tcr) in their paper (10(-6)) differ from our observations for S. mutans. We found nearly 100% of Tcr white colonies to be Emr whereas in S. gordonii, only a fraction (approximately 1%) exhibited the TcrEmr phenotype. If both phenotypes arose independently, the frequency of the TcrEmr phenotype would be 10(-8) rather than 10(-6) survivors/recipients as observed. It was surmised that both Tcr and Emr transformants arise dependently [1] where both the Tn916 intermediate and pAM118 contribute to the formation of Tn916 inserts. We conclude from their data, however, that most Tcr arose from the Tn916-intermediate formed in the donor, in agreement with the explanation of these data by Scott [12]. Support for the contention that the Tcr arose in S. gordonii from transformation by the Tn916-intermediate as in S. mutans (yellows), and not from intracellular excision from pAM118, comes from the observation that so few Tcr are Ems and because pAM150 (rep-) yields Tcr at the same frequency as the rep+ pAM118 in their experiments. In summary, the Tn916 intermediate is capable of transforming S. mutans. In contrast to the hypothesis of Scott [12], however, the Tn916 intermediate is not the only form involved in the transformat++t
TI  - Identification of a Vibrio cholerae ToxR-activated gene (tagD) that is physically linked to the toxin-coregulated pilus (tcp) gene cluster.
AB  - The toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP)-encoding gene cluster (tcp) specifies a type-IV pilus that is a major colonization determinant of Vibrio cholerae. We have identified a gene 200 bp upstream from the tcp cluster that requires ToxR for expression. We have designated this gene tagD (ToxR-activated gene) and have shown that tagD is encoded on a 600-nt transcript. The deduced tagD product is a 164-amino-acid polypeptide (20 kDa). Interestingly, TagD shares a high degree of similarity to a protein of Streptococcus sanguis 12 that is thought to play a role in fimbriae synthesis or assembly. The high degree of similarity between tagD and the Ss 12 protein provides preliminary evidence that tagD represents an additional member of the tcp cluster.
TI  - Identification of antimicrobial peptides by using combinatorial libraries made up of unnatural amino acids.
AB  - The use of water-soluble synthetic peptide combinatorial libraries permits the systematic examination of tens to hundreds of millions of peptides in existing microdilution assays. In the present study, we prepared and determined the antistaphylococcal activities of two new synthetic peptide combinatorial libraries (one N-acetylated, the other not) composed of tetrapeptides having one position defined and the remaining three positions made up of mixtures of L-, D-, and unnatural amino acids (a total of 58 different amino acids). These libraries, when used in conjunction with an iterative selection process, allowed for the development of a series of individually defined tetrapeptides with high levels of activity against Staphylococcus aureus. The activities of the final individual peptides against two additional strains of gram-positive bacteria (methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Streptococcus sanguis), a gram-negative bacterium (Escherichia coli), as well as the yeast Candida albicans were also determined. Cell viability assays showed that the identified peptides are bacteriostatic against both S. aureus and E. coli.
TI  - The bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis. A prospective study using ultrasound-guided transthoracic needle aspiration.
AB  - Obstructive pneumonitis, the opacity that develops distal to an obstructing endobronchial lesion or external compression, is actually a combination of atelectasis, bronchiectasis with mucus plugging, and true parenchymal inflammation. In the majority of cases, it is usually not possible to determine whether infection is present or not from the radiographic findings alone. The aim of this study was to evaluate the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis and the influence of this result on the treatment of patients. From March 1992 to February 1993, 26 consecutive patients (20 men and six women) with obstructive pneumonitis were investigated. The obstructive pneumonitis had been caused by malignant tumors in 24 and benign lesions in two. Chest ultrasound (US) and US-guided percutaneous transthoracic aspirations were undergone to obtain specimens for microbiologic examination. Microorganisms were isolated from seven of nine febrile patients and two of 17 nonfebrile patients. A total of 16 bacterial strains are detected in obstructive pneumonitis (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, viridant streptococci, Bacteroides fragilis, two Peptostreptococcus species, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Streptococcus sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides thetaiotamomicrons, Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides species, Veillonella species, aerobic gram-positive bacilli, and Escherichia coli). In five cases the isolates were monobacteriae, and in the remaining four cases, cultures yielded more than one bacteria. The results of aspirate cultures led to changes in the initial antibiotic trial in seven of nine patients, and fever subsided thereafter. Pneumothorax occurred in one cases as the sole complication. The pathogen causing obstructive pneumonitis is very heterogeneous, and polymicrobial infection is common.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Bactericidal action of tachyplesin I against oral streptococci.
AB  - Tachyplesin I, a polycationic antimicrobial peptide isolated from hemocytes of horseshoe crabs, kills bacteria by disrupting the membrane potential of the cytoplasmic membrane. The present study shows that, among 36 oral streptococcal strains, 12 of 21 Streptococcus sanguis, 3 Streptococcus mutans, 9 Streptococcus salivarius and 3 Streptococcus milleri strains were susceptible to tachyplesin I, whereas 9 S. sanguis strains were resistant. Interestingly, these resistant strains include the clinical isolates from both Kawasaki disease and Behcet patients. According to the time-kill study, tachyplesin I inhibited irreversibly the growth of S. sanguis, S. mutans and S. salivarius strains within 20 min and an S. milleri strain within 80 min. Although it has been suggested that Escherichia coli cultured in rich media were more susceptible to tachyplesin I, the present results show that only 3 S. milleri strains were more sensitized to tachyplesin I in a glucose-supplemented medium, and other tested strains were not. Similarly, only 4 strains were more resistant to tachyplesin I in saline than these were in a rich medium.
TI  - Use of restriction fragment polymorphism analysis of rRNA genes to assign species to unknown clinical isolates of oral viridans streptococci.
AB  - This study evaluated restriction fragment length polymorphisms of rRNA genes (ribotyping) for genotypic identification of 53 oral isolates classified as "Streptococcus sanguis" by colony morphology. Isolates were from 8-h buccal plaque on lower first permanent molars of 20 subjects. DNA was digested with AatII and hybridized with digoxygenin-labeled cDNA of Escherichia coli 16S and 23S rRNA. Strains were ribotyped again with AlwNI or PvuII on the basis of the presence or absence of a 2,290-bp AatII band. Band patterns were compared with reference ribotypes for Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus crista, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, and Streptococcus parasanguis strains. Forty-eight isolates could be assigned to a species (22 S. sanguis, 14 S. oralis, 12 S. gordonii). Multiple species were seen in 14 subjects; multiple strains of the same species occurred in 11 subjects. Our findings suggest that ribotyping can be used for genotypic identification of S. sanguis, S. oralis, and S. gordonii isolates.
TI  - Molecular characterization of a plasmid-borne (pGT633) erythromycin resistance determinant (ermGT) from Lactobacillus reuteri 100-63.
AB  - Lactobacillus reuteri 100-63 contains a 9.8 kb plasmid (pGT633) encoding resistance to the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) type B antibiotics. The restriction endonucleases AccI, BamHI, BclI, EcoRI, EcoRV, HhaI, HindII, HpaI, KpnI, SalI, and SspI were employed to establish a physical map of pGT633. Next, genetic transfer experiments were conducted to establish the host range of pGT633. The results revealed that pGT633 replicated autonomously and encoded constitutive resistance to erythromycin in a variety of bacterial hosts, including Bacillus subtilis BD170, Streptococcus sanguis DL1, Staphylococcus aureus RN4220, and Enterococcus faecalis 19433, as well as several Lactobacillus spp. A 2.2 kb BamHI fragment of pGT633 containing the genetic determinant (ermGT) encoding resistance to erythromycin was cloned into Escherichia coli. Determination of the nucleotide sequence of ermGT revealed a methylase gene 731 bp in length that was highly related (ca. 81% nucleotide and ca. 78% amino acid identity) to the ermC gene from S. aureus plasmid pE194. The leader sequences of ermGT and ermC were identical except for a single base change at nt 51.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequence analysis of psaA, the Streptococcus pneumoniae gene encoding a 37-kilodalton protein homologous to previously reported Streptococcus sp. adhesins.
AB  - Gene psaA, which encodes the Streptococcus pneumoniae 37-kDa protein, was cloned  in Escherichia coli, and its complete nucleotide sequence was determined. Analysis of the sequence of the 2.4-kb cloned fragment revealed three open reading frames (ORFs). ORF2, which is 933 bp long, was identified as psaA. The two other ORFs identified flank psaA. ORF1, located upstream of psaA, is 836 nucleotides long and encodes a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 29,843 Da. The sequence for ORF3, located downstream of psaA, was only partially determined. Northern (RNA) blot analysis of pneumococcal RNA suggests that psaA is transcribed as part of a polycistronic message. Analysis of the primary structure of the protein encoded by this gene indicated significant similarity to two previously reported streptococcal proteins, SsaB (80% similarity) and FimA (92.3% similarity), from S. sanguis and S. parasanguis, respectively. These two homologous proteins have been shown to be associated with bacterial adhesion, and the possibility of a similar role for PsaA is hypothesized.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of cytotoxic drugs may influence isolation of bacteria and fungi from blood cultures.
AB  - The potential antimicrobial activity of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and adriamycin against Gram positive and negative bacteria and Candida albicans was examined. The time taken for different microbial inocula to turn a simulated blood culture positive in the presence of different concentrations of these drugs was measured. Doxorubicin retarded the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus sanguis in a concentration dependent manner. Cyclophosphamide and vincristine showed minimal antimicrobial activity. Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were unaffected by any of the drugs. An inoculum dependent effect was seen with some combinations of microbial inocula and cytotoxic drug concentrations.
TI  - Glucose stimulates cAMP accumulation in the oral bacterium Actinomyces viscosus.
AB  - Actinomyces viscosus T14V, a Gram-positive bacterium found in the oral cavity, was found to be insensitive to glucose-mediated catabolite repression. Basal levels of beta-galactosidase (18-26 U) were observed at all phases of growth regardless of the culture conditions. Further, beta-galactosidase could not be induced with lactose, or with a known inducer of the enzyme, isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside, or with dibutyryl cAMP. Glucose, on the other hand, stimulated cAMP accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. Fructose and sucrose mimicked the effects of glucose on cAMP accumulation, whereas galactose, mannose and maltose had lesser stimulatory effects. Other carbon sources, i.e., lactose, alpha-methylglucoside, ribose, xylose and succinate were without effect. Glucose and alpha-methylglucoside were found to stimulate cAMP accumulation in toluene-permeabilized cells, in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, theophylline. Glucose did not stimulate cAMP levels in other Gram-positive bacteria including Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis and S. salivarius but did cause cAMP accumulation in other strains of A. viscosus. The results suggest that glucose effects on cAMP metabolism are independent of the induction of beta-galactosidase as presently defined for Escherichia coli, and that the effects appear to be selective to the A. viscosus bacteria. The results also suggest that glucose stimulates cAMP accumulation via activation of adenylate cyclase.
TI  - Species identification of oral viridans streptococci by restriction fragment polymorphism analysis of rRNA genes.
AB  - Oral streptococci formerly classified as Streptococcus sanguis have been divided  into six genetic groups. Methods to identify those species by genotype are needed. This study compared restriction fragment polymorphisms of rRNA genes (ribotypes) for seven S. gordonii, three S. sanguis, four S. oralis, three S. mitis, one S. crista, and seven S. parasanguis strains classified in previous DNA hybridization studies, as well as one clinical isolate. DNA was digested with HindIII, PvuII, HindIII and PvuII combined, EcoRI, BamHI, AatII, AlwNI, and DraII. DNA fragments were hybridized with a digoxigenin-labeled cDNA probe obtained by reverse transcription of Escherichia coli 16S and 23S rRNA. S. oralis, S. mitis, and S. parasanguis all showed an isolated 2,290-bp band in AatII ribotypes that was absent from S. gordonii, S. sanguis, and S. crista. The last three groups showed species-specific bands with AatII and also with PvuII. S. oralis could be distinguished from S. mitis and S. parasanguis in AlwNI and DraII ribotypes. S. mitis and S. parasanguis could not be distinguished, since they shared multiple bands in PvuII, AlwNI, and EcoRI patterns. The clinical isolate in the panel was very similar to S. sanguis by all enzymes used. Our findings suggest that ribotyping may be useful for genotypic identification of oral viridans streptococci. Initial digests of clinical isolates might be made with AatII, followed by PvuII or AlwNI. Isolates then could be identified by comparing ribotype patterns with those of reference strains. This approach could facilitate clinical studies of these newly defined species.
TI  - Cloning of the Streptococcus gordonii PK488 gene, encoding an adhesin which mediates coaggregation with Actinomyces naeslundii PK606.
AB  - Coaggregation between Streptococcus gordonii PK488 and Actinomyces naeslundii PK606 is mediated by a 38-kDa streptococcal protein, designated ScaA. The gene, scaA, which encodes this protein has been cloned into Escherichia coli. A genomic S. gordonii PK488 library (in Lambda ZAP II) was screened with anti-S. gordonii immunoglobulin G absorbed with S. gordonii PK1804, an isogenic coaggregation-defective mutant of strain PK488. A positive recombinant phage was isolated, and a phagemid designated pRA1 was obtained which contained a 6.6-kb insert. Expression of scaA from pRA1 and from a subcloned internal 2.1-kb fragment was observed. The absorbed antiserum cross-reacted with a 34.7-kDa protein, SsaB, from S. sanguis 12, also a coaggregation partner of A. naeslundii PK606. Absorbed antiserum to S. gordonii PK488 and antiserum to SsaB both reacted with 38-kDa proteins in supernatants from mildly sonicated preparations from 11 other coaggregation partners of A. naeslundii PK606. Putative adhesin genes were identified in each of these coaggregation partners by Southern analysis of their genomic DNA with the cloned 2.1-kb fragment as a probe. A 30-base oligonucleotide probe based on the sequence of ssaB of S. sanguis 12 hybridized in an identical manner. These data extend the notion that most of the viridans streptococci that coaggregate with actinomyces are capable of expressing ScaA-related proteins.
TI  - Overexpression and purification of a fimbria-associated adhesin of Streptococcus  parasanguis.
AB  - A Streptococcus parasanguis adhesin that blocks the attachment of S. parasanguis  FW213 to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (SCHA) has been purified. Previous work demonstrated that the attachment of FW213 to SCHA is mediated by fimbriae and that one component associated with fimbriae is a 36-kDa protein (FimA) that reacts with antifimbria serum in Western blots (immunoblots) and is not present in afimbriated mutants. To obtain amounts of FimA sufficient for adhesion blocking assays, we cloned the gene coding for FimA into an Escherichia coli T7 overexpression system. The resulting strain produced large amounts of FimA, as much as 50% of the total cell protein. FimA was purified by elution from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, and its native conformation was reestablished by sodium dodecyl sulfate removal, resolubilization in guanidine hydrochloride, and 50-fold dilution. Some refolded FimA aggregated into dimers and trimers. Preincubation of SCHA with 100 micrograms of purified, renatured FimA per ml blocked 85% of the binding of FW213. The FimA-SCHA complex was quite stable and could be washed continuously for at least 2 h with only a slight loss of FimA blocking activity. When FimA was added to preformed bacterium-SCHA complexes, it displaced 40% of the bacteria already bound to SCHA. The results suggest that FimA is an adhesin with a high substrate affinity and may prove useful in the development of a therapeutic agent for the prevention of plaque formation and endocarditis initiated by the sanguis streptococci.
TI  - Saliva-binding protein (SsaB) from Streptococcus sanguis 12 is a lipoprotein.
AB  - Two lipoprotein consensus sequences (Leu-X-X-Cys) are found in the presumptive signal peptide region (positions 12 to 15 and 17 to 20) of saliva-binding protein (SsaB) from Streptococcus sanguis 12. Three analogs of SsaB containing Cys-->Gly mutations were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of pSA2, the recombinant plasmid expressing SsaB. [3H]palmitate was incorporated into SsaB only when the native Cys-20 residue was present. These data show that SsaB is a lipoprotein and that Cys-20 is the critical site for acylation.
TI  - Effect of gels containing stannous fluoride on oral bacteria--an in vitro study.
AB  - The purposes of this investigation were to evaluate and compare the antimicrobial effect of (1) twelve 0.4 per cent stannous fluoride (SnF2) commercial products and (2) different concentrations of SnF2 (range = 0.02 to 3.28 per cent). The antibacterial inhibitory effect of various SnF2 gels was evaluated as to their effectiveness against oral plaque bacteria including strains of S. mutans, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus, A. viscosus, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and B. intermedius. When twelve different commercial preparations of 0.4 per cent SnF2 were compared for inhibitory effect on plaque bacteria, several of the SnF2 preparations were significantly more effective in inhibiting oral bacteria (p < 0.05). With increasing concentration of SnF2, there was a comparable increase in the inhibitory effect on the oral bacteria tested (r2 ranged from 0.867 to 0.996). SnF2 at a concentration of 0.4 per cent had a similar antibacterial effect to 0.12 per cent chlorhexidine. This in vitro study demonstrated that certain SnF2 products are highly effective in inhibiting the growth of bacteria often found in plaque, and this inhibitory effect is directly related to the concentration of the SnF2.
TI  - Cloning and sequence analysis of the StsI restriction-modification gene: presence of homology to FokI restriction-modification enzymes.
AB  - StsI endonuclease (R.StsI), a type IIs restriction endonuclease found in Streptococcus sanguis 54, recognizes the same sequence as FokI but cleaves at different positions. A DNA fragment that carried the genes for R.StsI and StsI methylase (M.StsI) was cloned from the chromosomal DNA of S.sanguis 54, and its nucleotide sequence was analyzed. The endonuclease gene was 1,806 bp long, corresponding to a protein of 602 amino acid residues (M(r) = 68,388), and the methylase gene was 1,959 bp long, corresponding to a protein of 653 amino acid residues (M(r) = 76,064). The assignment of the endonuclease gene was confirmed by analysis of the N-terminal amino acid sequence. Genes for the two proteins were in a tail-to-tail orientation, separated by a 131-nucleotide intercistronic region. The predicted amino acid sequences between the StsI system and the FokI system showed a 49% identity between the methylases and a 30% identity between the endonucleases. The sequence comparison of M.StsI with various methylases showed that the N-terminal half of M.StsI matches M.NIaIII, and the C-terminal half matches adenine methylases that recognize GATC and GATATC.
TI  - Streptococcal-related antigens stimulate production of IL6 and interferon-gamma by T cells from patients with Behcet's disease.
AB  - Greater attention has been recently paid to the role of certain strains of streptococcus as an etiologic agent of Behcet's disease, in which T cell abnormalities are considered to be involved. We therefore examined whether T cells from patients with Behcet's disease might to be stimulated by Streptococcus sanguis-related antigen (RRE KTH-1 antigens). T cells from 17 patients with Behcet's disease, but not those from 13 healthy individuals or from 13 patients with other rheumatic diseases, were stimulated to produce greater amounts of interleukin 6 (IL6) by addition of RRE KTH-1 antigens [stimulation index: 3.96 +/- 0.56 and 1.35 +/- 0.28 or 1.83 +/- 0.43 (mean +/- SEM), respectively]. The IL6 production by T cells required the presence of either fresh or paraformaldehyde-fixed monocytes. The enhancement of T cell IL6 production was not related to the presence of HLA-B51, which has been shown to be frequently associated with Behcet's disease. These results indicate that T cells from patients with Behcet's disease are stimulated by streptococcal antigens to produce IL6 through T cell-monocyte interactions in which binding of the antigens to monocytes, but not necessarily processing of the antigens by monocytes, is involved. Moreover, RRE KTH-1 antigens as well as Escherichia coli-derived antigens also enhanced the production of interferon-gamma by T cells from patients with Behcet's disease. The data thus suggest that T cell hypersensitivity to several bacterial antigens may play a central role in the pathogenesis of Behcet's disease.
TI  - A truncated Tn916-like element in a clinical isolate of Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - A 58.7-kb nonconjugative plasmid (pKQ1) previously reported in a clinical isolate of Enterococcus faecium was found to contain both a tetM and an erythromycin resistance (erm) determinant. The plasmid contained a region homologous to the A, F, H, and G HincII fragments of Tn916. However, the 4.8-kb B fragment of Tn916 which contained the tetM determinant was replaced by a 7.3-kb fragment, and the 3.6-kb HincII C fragment of Tn916 was missing. An element homologous to Tn917 was juxtaposed to the truncated Tn916-like element. The Tn917-like element was similar in size to the erm transposon Tn917 as determined by a ClaI restriction digest which spanned approximately 99% of the transposon. When Bacillus subtilis or Streptococcus sanguis were transformed with pKQ1, no zygotically induced transposition of the tetM element was detected. Similarly no transposition of the Tn917-like element was detected.
TI  - Synergy and cumulated killing effect of the penems FCE 22101 and FCE 25199 in combination with gentamicin against bacteria isolated from septicaemia.
AB  - Blood isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli and Klebsiella oxytoca were tested for their synergistic and cumulated killing effect (CKE) with the new penems FCE 22101 or FCE 25199 in combination with gentamicin. The tissue cage model in rabbits was used to study the CKE in vivo after antibiotic treatment of the bacteria in vitro. Synergy was observed within two to seven h with all isolates in early logarithmic phase, except with S. aureus, which was rapidly killed by the penems alone. After one h treatment with the antibiotic combinations in vitro, a CKE was demonstrated for up to six h both in vitro and in vivo. The magnitude of the CKE differed between strains and in vitro vs. in vivo.
TI  - Protein A-streptokinase fusion protein for immunodetection of specific IgG antibodies.
AB  - The streptococcal streptokinase gene truncated at its 5' end was fused to regions of the staphylococcal protein A gene encoding the Fc-binding domains A and B. The resultant fusion gene, when expressed in the Escherichia coli lacPO system or under the speA expression/secretion signals in S. sanguis, specified a bifunctional hybrid protein, SPA-SKC, capable of Fc binding and plasminogen activation. When used in immunoassays designed to titrate antisera raised against bovine chymosin, human serum albumin and fibrinogen, the assay using SPA-SKC compared well with that using a commercial SPA-enzyme conjugate. The simple preparative method together with its efficacy and ease of use, make SPA-SKC a potentially valuable detector reagent in quantitative immunology.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide base sequence analysis of a spectinomycin adenyltransferase AAD(9) determinant from Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis LDR55, a human clinical isolate, is resistant to tetracycline (Tcr), erythromycin (Emr), and high levels (greater than 2,000 micrograms/ml) of spectinomycin (Spr) but not streptomycin. Filter matings between strain LDR55 and E. faecalis OG1-RF produced transconjugants with the following resistance phenotypes: Tcr Emr Spr, Tcr Emr, Tcr Spr, and Tcr only but never Emr or Spr only. The genetic determinant encoding resistance to spectinomycin was cloned in Streptococcus sanguis Challis from pDL55, a 26-kb plasmid harbored by a Tcr Spr transconjugant. Subcloning experiments yielded a 1.1-kb ClaI-NdeI fragment that encoded very high-level Spr in S. sanguis (10 mg/ml) and Escherichia coli (50 mg/ml). Cell extracts of cultures obtained from Spr strains expressed adenylating activity for spectinomycin but not for streptomycin, indicating that Spr was due to an AAD(9) activity. The nucleotide base sequence of the 1.1-kb ClaI-NdeI fragment contained a single 750-base open reading frame. The protein predicted from the open reading frame consisted of 250 amino acids and had a calculated size of approximately 28,000 daltons, similar to the size estimated from maxicell analysis (29,000 daltons). The deduced amino acid sequence of the streptococcal AAD(9) was compared with that of the AAD(9) encoded by staphylococcal transposon Tn554. The two proteins shared approximately 39% amino acid identity, which was expanded to 53% when conservative amino acid changes were included. When the streptococcal protein was compared with an AAD(3")(9) protein of E. coli, the degrees of identity were 27 and 47%, on the basis of actual amino acids and conservative replacements, respectively. The cloning and nucleotide base sequence analyses of the spectinomycin AAD(9) determinant from E. faecalis that results in high-level Spr when transferred to S. sanguis or E. coli are presented.
TI  - Sorbitol inhibition of glucose metabolism by Streptococcus sanguis 160.
AB  - Clinical studies in Sweden have shown that the proportion of sorbitol-utilizing strains of Streptococcus sanguis increases in dental plaque from individuals using sorbitol-containing products for prolonged periods. We have undertaken to study the metabolism of glucose and sorbitol by S. sanguis 160, isolated from a subject consuming sorbitol-containing chewing-gum 4 times a day for 4 years. Growth on glucose was inhibited by the presence of sorbitol in the growth medium and sorbitol was utilized in the presence of glucose, albeit, at a slower rate than glucose. In addition, pulses of glucose added to cultures growing on sorbitol resulted in the expulsion of sorbitol from the cell. In order to examine further the relationship of sorbitol and glucose, uptake assays were carried out with S. sanguis 160 grown in continuous culture (pH 7.0, dilution rate = 0.1 h-1) with glucose, sorbitol or nitrogen (sorbitol excess) limitations. The uptake of [14C]-glucose by sorbitol-limited cells, but not by glucose-limited cells, was inhibited by sorbitol, as was glycolysis. Kinetic experiments with glucose-limited cells showed 2 transport systems for glucose with Ks values of 5.2 and 40 microM, and glucose phosphorylation activity by decryptified cells indicated transport by the P-enolpyruvate (PEP) phosphotransferase system (PTS) with lesser activity for an ATP-dependent transport process. Transition from glucose-limited growth to sorbitol-limited growth revealed repression of total [14C]-glucose uptake by intact cells and activity for Enzyme II for glucose (Ellglc) of the PTS measured in membrane preparations in the presence of an excess of the soluble PTS proteins in crude cell-free supernatant fractions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Aggregation of group A streptococci by human saliva and effect of saliva on streptococcal adherence to host cells.
AB  - The aggregation of group A streptococci by whole, stimulated human saliva (WHS) and the effect of saliva on streptococcal adherence to host cells was investigated. WHS samples from 11 individuals were found to aggregate both M+ and M- group A streptococci to various degrees. The aggregating activity was sensitive to heat, EDTA, EGTA [ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid], sodium dodecyl sulfate, and lipoteichoic acid. None of the simple sugars tested, mercaptoethanol, albumin, or nonionic detergents had any effect on aggregation. The aggregating activity of EDTA-treated saliva was restored by 0.1 mM Ca2+ and 1.0 mM Mn2+ but not by up to 5 mM Mg2+. Only streptococci from the stationary phase were aggregated. Hyaluronidase treatment of streptococci from the exponential phase of growth restored their ability to be aggregated, suggesting that the hyaluronic acid capsule interferes with agglutination. Adsorption of WHS by one strain of Streptococcus pyogenes removed aggregating activity for other strains of S. pyogenes and Streptococcus sanguis but not agglutinins for Escherichia coli, suggesting that the agglutinin is specific for certain gram-positive bacteria. Molecular sieve chromatography of WHS and identification of streptococcus-binding components of saliva suggest that either a glycoprotein of approximately 360 kDa or a mucin of saliva of greater than 1,000 kDa mediates aggregation of streptococci. WHS also inhibited adherence of S. pyogenes to buccal epithelial cells.
TI  - Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequencing of the Arthrobacter dextranase gene and its expression in Escherichia coli and Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - A bacterial strain, which assimilated dextran and water-insoluble glucan produced by Streptococcus mutans, was isolated from soil. The bacterium produced and secreted potent dextranase activity, which was identified as Arthrobacter sp. and named CB-8. The dextranase was purified and some enzymatic properties were characterized. The enzyme efficiently decomposed the water-insoluble glucan as well as dextran. A gene library from the bacteria was constructed with Escherichia coli, using plasmid pUC19, and clones producing dextranase activity were selected. Based on the result of nucleotide sequencing analysis, it was deduced that the dextranase was synthesized in CB-8 cells as a polypeptide precursor consisting of 640 amino acid residues, including 49 N-terminal amino acid residues which could be regarded as a signal peptide. In the E. coli transformant, the dextranase activity was detected mostly in the periplasmic space. The gene for the dextranase was introduced into Streptococcus sanguis, using an E. coli-S. sanguis shuttle vector that contained the promoter sequence of a gene for glucosyltransferase derived from a strain of S. mutans. The active dextranase was also expressed and accumulated in S. sanguis cells.
TI  - Polymerase chain reaction amplification, cloning, sequence determination and homologies of streptococcal ATPase-encoding DNAs.
AB  - The highly conserved portion of the catalytic subunit (beta-subunit) of the membrane-bound, proton-translocating ATPase from three strains of oral streptococci has been amplified via the polymerase chain reaction. Hybridization studies demonstrated the existence of homology between Escherichia coli and Bacillus megaterium beta-subunit probes at the streptococcal DNA level. Highly degenerate primers, based on the E. coli and B. megaterium amino acid (aa) sequences, were used to amplify the homologues in Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis and S. sobrinus. The 600 bp fragment from S. sobrinus has been cloned and its nucleotide (nt) sequence determined. Comparison of its nt and deduced aa sequence to that of E. coli and B. megaterium reveals a high degree of homology at the aa level.
TI  - Analysis of the immunoglobulin A protease gene of Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - The amino acid sequence T-P-P-T-P-S-P-S is tandemly duplicated in the heavy chain of human immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1), the major antibody in secretions. The bacterial pathogen Streptococcus sanguis, a precursor to dental caries and a cause of bacterial endocarditis, yields IgA protease that cleaves only the Pro-Thr peptide bond in the left duplication, while the type 2 IgA proteases of the genital pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae and the respiratory pathogen Haemophilus influenzae cleave only the P-T bond in the right half. We have sequenced the entire S. sanguis iga gene cloned into Escherichia coli. A segment consisting of 20 amino acids tandemly repeated 10 times, of unknown function, occurs near the amino-terminal end of the enzyme encoded in E. coli. Identification of a predicted zinc-binding region in the S. sanguis enzyme and the demonstration that mutations in this region result in production of a catalytically inactive protein support the idea that the enzyme is a metalloprotease. The N. gonorrhoeae and H. influenzae enzymes were earlier shown to be serine-type proteases, while the Bacteroides melaninogenicus IgA protease was shown to be a cysteine-type enzyme. The streptococcal IgA protease amino acid sequence has no significant homology with either of the two previously determined IgA protease sequences, that of type 2 N. gonorrhoeae and type 1 H. influenzae. The differences in both structure and mechanism among these functionally analogous enzymes underscore their role in the infectious process and offer some prospect of therapeutic intervention.
TI  - Disinfection by endodontic irrigants and dressings of experimentally infected dentinal tubules.
AB  - The effect of endodontic irrigants and dressings was tested on bacteria in bovine dentin specimens experimentally infected with Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Escherichia coli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Standardized, cylindrical dentin test pieces were prepared and cleaned by ultrasonic treatment with EDTA and sodium hypochlorite. The specimens were infected with the test organism for periods up to 14 days, and the degree of infection into the tubules was monitored using Brown & Brenn stain, scanning electron microscopy, and culturing of dentin dust from sequential bur samples starting from the pulpal side. E. faecalis rapidly infected the whole length of the tubules; S. sanguis required up to 2 weeks for complete infection; E. coli only penetrated to some 600 microns, even after prolonged incubation periods. P. aeruginosa infected dentin quickly, but apparently in very low numbers. E. faecalis persisted for at least 10 d after withdrawal of nutrient support, whereas the other 3 organisms died within 4 to 48 h. Endodontic medicaments were applied to infected specimen for comparison of antibacterial potency. Camphorated p-monochlorophenol was generally more efficient than Calasept, and of the irrigants tested, iodine potassium iodide appeared more potent than sodium hypochlorite or chlorhexidine. The presence of a smear layer delayed, but did not eliminate, the effect of the medicaments.
TI  - Influenza A virus potentiates bacteria-induced histamine release. Examination of  normal individuals and patients allergic to bacteria.
AB  - Influenza A virus was found to enhance basophil histamine release induced by Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus sanguis, but did not per se release histamine. This potentiating effect of the virus was seen both when the bacteria-induced mediator release was IgE-dependent (i.e. patient allergic to bacterium) and when the bacterium caused histamine release by a non-immunological mechanism independent of IgE (putative sugar-lectin mediated). Also histamine release induced by other immunological and non-immunological stimuli, such as anti-IgE, calcium ionophore or agarose beads was enhanced in the presence of the virus. The potentiating effect of the virus on bacteria-induced mediator release might be of importance for the conversion from latent to manifest asthma in upper respiratory tract infections.
TI  - [Molecular cloning and expression of a dextranase gene from Arthrobacter in Streptococcus sanguis].
AB  - The gene coding for a dextranase activity of Arthrobacter CB-8, named dex gene, was isolated and cloned into Escherichia coli and into Streptococcus sanguis. The gene library was screened by transparent halo formation around the colonies grown on agar medium containing blue dextran. DNA fragment consisting of about 3,200 base pairs was prepared for further cloning procedures. Dextranase activity was detected in the periplasmic space of E. coli clones, using pUC19, pVA 838 and their derivatives. Dex gene was also introduced into S. sanguis Challis using pVA 838, a plasmid that is able to replicate in both E. coli and S. sanguis. But the clones did not express the dex gene. For the expression of dex gene in S. sanguis, a new shuttle vector was constructed, which contained the promoter region of a glucosyltransferase gene from S. mutans as well as the terminator region of ribosomal RNA from E. coli. The plasmid was designated pMNK. Using pMNK as vector, dex gene was expressed in S. sanguis. Dextranase activity was detected in the cellular fraction of the clones.
TI  - Streptococcal-host interactions. Structural and functional analysis of a Streptococcus sanguis receptor for a human salivary glycoprotein.
AB  - Colonization of oral tissues by Streptococcus sanguis may be influenced by a mucin-like salivary glycoprotein (SAG) through a calcium-dependent interaction with a specific bacterial receptor. We report the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of the S. sanguis receptor (SSP-5) and show that this protein may bind sialic acid residues of SAG. The SSP-5 protein contains three unique structural domains, two of which consist of repetitive amino acid sequences. The N-terminal domain is comprised of four tandem copies of an 82-residue repeat which exhibits homology to M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes. This region is highly charged and predicted to be alpha-helical. A second hydrophilic repetitive domain consists of three copies of a 39-amino acid sequence containing 30% proline flanked by nonrepetitive proline-rich sequence. The third domain consists of 48% proline and resides near the C terminus of the protein. Secondary structure analysis of the SSP-5 sequence also identified four potential helix-turn-helix motifs that resembled E-F hand calcium binding domains. The SSP-5 protein is highly homologous to a surface antigen expressed by the mutans streptococci and the domain structure of SSP-5 is conserved within this family of proteins. The interactions of SSP-5 and of intact S. sanguis with SAG were inhibited by neuraminidase digestion of the salivary glycoprotein and by simple sugars containing sialic acid, suggesting that sialic acid is the primary ligand involved in the binding reaction.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a Bacteroides loeschei adhesin that interacts with procaryotic and eucaryotic cells.
AB  - The adhesin of Bacteroides loeschei PK1295 that mediates coaggregation with Streptococcus sanguis 34 and hemagglutination of erythrocytes was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. The lectinlike protein has an estimated native Mr of 450,000 and consists of six subunits of identical molecular weight (Mr 75,000). The purified adhesin appears to be a basic protein with a pI between 7.4 and 8.0. Amino acid and N-terminal sequence analyses were carried out with the purified protein. These indicated that the protein contains a large number of Asx and Glx residues as well as basic amino acid residues. The binding site of the pure adhesin retained its native configuration during purification. When preincubated with streptococcal partner cells at pH 4.6, the adhesin prevented B. loeschei cells from coaggregating with the streptococci. An adhesin preparation adjusted to a pH of 6.8 rapidly agglutinated both streptococci and neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes. Galactosides inhibited the agglutination reactions.
TI  - Molecular characterization of promoters of the Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris temperate bacteriophage BK5-T and identification of a phage gene implicated in the regulation of promoter activity.
AB  - DNA fragments from the temperate lactococcal bacteriophage BK5-T were cloned into the promoter-detecting plasmid pMU1328. Five DNA fragments conferring promoter activity were selected by transformation of Streptococcus sanguis and were functional in Escherichia coli, S. sanguis, and Lactococcus lactis subspp. lactis and cremoris. The nucleotide sequences of these fragments were determined, and primer extension analysis was used to locate the site of initiation of transcription from each promoter in both E. coli and S. sanguis. Transcription was initiated from the same nucleotide in these two organisms, and the promoters contained -10 and -35 regions similar to the consensus sequence for E. coli promoters. The activities of three of the five promoters were decreased two- to threefold when a compatible plasmid containing a 3.8-kilobase-pair EcoRI fragment (EcoRI-f) of BK5-T was coresident with the promoter-containing plasmid in either L. lactis subsp. cremoris or E. coli. Data from Tn5 mutagenesis, subcloning experiments, and DNA sequence analysis indicate that this decrease in promoter activity requires a region of EcoRI-f that contains a 621-base-pair open reading frame. This region has been designated bpi (for BK5-T promoter inhibitor).
TI  - [Studies on delayed skin reactivity to streptococci in Behcet's disease].
AB  - Delayed type hypersensitivity of patients with Behcet's disease was investigated  by intradermal skin test and prick test, using various inactivated microorganisms as antigens. In the intradermal skin test, 13 patients showed significantly increased skin reactivity to E. faecalis, compared with 5 normal controls. No significant differences were observed between these two groups in terms of reaction to S. pyogenes. Prick test was performed in 11 patients and 6 controls, using S. pyogenes, S. sanguis, S. salivarius and E. faecalis as antigens. It was shown that patients with this disease had significantly greater skin reactions to crude cell wall antigens, as well as to whole cell antigens of these streptococci than the controls. The antigenicity of streptococci seemed to be present mainly in the cell wall fragment, and these streptococci seemed to have cross reactivity with each other. These results suggest that streptococci may have some significant role in the immunopathogenesis of this disease.
TI  - Novel shuttle vectors for improved streptokinase expression in streptococci and bacterial L-forms.
AB  - Novel shuttle vectors of small size and increased copy number capable of replication in Escherichia coli, L-forms of Proteus mirabilis, and streptococci were constructed from a streptococcal erythromycin-resistant plasmid and an Escherichia coli phasmid. The streptokinase gene, skc, was inserted into one of them, and skc expression was studied in Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus lactis, and in an L-form strain (LVI) of Proteus mirabilis. The new streptokinase shuttle plasmid, pMLS10 (7.3 kb), specified higher Skc yields in all hosts when compared to pSM752 constructed previously. In particular Proteus mirabilis LVI(pMLS10) proved to be the most productive host, exhibiting complete secretion of the active protein at yields as high as 24000 unit per ml.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence analysis of a type 1 fimbrial gene of Streptococcus sanguis FW213.
AB  - A structural gene for type 1 fimbriae of Streptococcus sanguis FW213 was located  within a 6-kilobase fragment cloned in Escherichia coli. A 1.6-kilobase internal fragment contains an open reading frame of 927 bases coding for an immunoreactive peptide of 34,349 daltons, which corresponds in size with an observed cytoplasmic form of fimbrial peptide (P. M. Fives-Taylor, F. L. Macrina, T. J. Pritchard, and S. J. Peene, Infect. Immun. 55:123-128, 1987). Disruption of the reading frame by insertional mutagenesis results in loss of immunoreactivity. Consensus sequences for initiation of transcription and translation were identified 5' to the coding region. Transcription terminator-like sequences were found downstream of the coding region. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cloned fimbrial peptide shows a strongly hydrophobic signal sequence at the amino terminus. The carboxyl-terminal region does not include a hydrophobic membrane anchor sequence such as has been reported for other gram-positive surface structures. A hydrophobic region of 12 to 14 amino acids downstream from the putative signal sequence cleavage site exhibits homology with the Streptococcus pyogenes type 6 M protein repetitive region A (S. K. Hollingshead, V. A. Fischetti, and J. R. Scott, J. Biol. Chem., 261:1677-1686, 1986). Functional homology at the level of protein secondary structure with Actinomyces viscosus T14V type 1 fimbriae (M. K. Yeung, B. M. Chassy, and J. O. Cisar, J. Bacteriol., 169:1678-1683, 1987) is proposed.
TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of the genes of the arginine deiminase system of Streptococcus sanguis NCTC 10904.
AB  - The common oral bacterium Streptococcus sanguis can degrade arginine via the arginine deiminase (AD) system. The three enzymes of this system, AD, ornithine carbamyltransferase (OTC), and carbamate kinase (CK), catalyze the breakdown of arginine to ornithine, CO2, and two molecules of ammonia, with the production of ATP from ADP. The genes of the AD system, which are subject to complex regulation in the oral streptococci, have been isolated in bacteriophage lambda by screening for AD activity. The AD gene, designated arcA, was expressed from recombinant bacteriophage or in cells harboring plasmid subclones from this phage at a level up to 1,000-fold lower than the level in fully derepressed S. sanguis but apparently under the control of its own promoter. By subcloning in Escherichia coli mutants defective in anabolic OTC (argF argL) and CK (carB), it was demonstrated that the genes for S. sanguis OTC and CK were located adjacent to the AD gene. The levels of expression of the OTC and CK genes (arcB and arcC, respectively) were also very low in E. coli, although arcC expression was not as poor as arcA and arcB expression when compared with the levels found in S. sanguis. Also, arcB and arcC were unable to complement the defects in their anabolic counterparts. Introduction of the entire AD system or subclones which encoded only the AD gene into E. coli harboring defects in arginine and pyrimidine biosynthesis resulted in a 10- to 15-fold decrease in the level of AD activity, suggesting that arginine or its metabolites may regulate AD expression. Transposon mutagenesis was utilized to construct defined mutants of S. sanguis with mutations in the AD gene cluster. AD gene expression in these mutants indicated that the expression of the AD genes in this organism is strongly interrelated. The isolation and partial characterization of the arc genes represents the first step in the genetic manipulation of the AD system in the oral streptococci for analysis of the regulation of AD, analysis of the role of the system in plaque ecology, and utilization of the system to modulate the cariogenicity of dental plaque.
TI  - Secretory expression in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis of human interferon alpha genes directed by staphylokinase signals.
AB  - A DNA segment covering the signal sequence coding region, the ribosome binding site, and the promoter of the staphylokinase (sak) 42D gene (Behnke and Gerlach 1987) was cloned into pUC19 to form a portable expression-secretion unit (ESU). Fusion of human interferon alpha 1 (hIFN alpha 1) and hybrid hIFN alpha 1/2 genes to this sak ESU resulted in secretory expression of the two gene products in both Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. While most of the IFN alpha was exported to the periplasmic space of E. coli, about 99% was secreted to the culture medium by recombinant B. subtilis strains. The total yield in E. coli was 1.2 x 10(5) IU/ml. This level of expression and export led to instability of the recombinant strains that was spontaneously relieved in vivo by inactivation of the sak ESU through insertion of an IS1 element. No such instability was observed with B. subtilis although expression and secretion levels reached even 3 x 10(6) IU/ml. Proteolytic degradation of IFN alpha by extracellular proteases was avoided by a combination of constitutive expression and secretion during the logarithmic growth phase and the use of exoprotease-reduced host strains. The IFN alpha 1 protein purified from B. subtilis culture supernatant was correctly processed, carried the expected 11 amino acid N-terminal elongation that resulted from DNA manipulations and proved to be homogenous in Western blotting experiments. The same recombinant plasmid that directed efficient secretion of hIFN alpha 1 in B. subtilis gave poor yields when introduced into Streptococcus sanguis.
TI  - Cloning and expression of an adhesin antigen of Streptococcus sanguis G9B in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A genomic library of Streptococcus sanguis, strain G9B, was constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli using a lambda gt11 expression vector. The amplified library was probed with polyclonal anti-G9B IgG and 13 antigen-positive clones were isolated. A lysate of one clone, designated PP39, absorbed the adhesion-inhibitory activity of anti-G9B IgG. This clone contained an insert of approximately 2000 bp and expressed unique 200 and 53 kDa proteins that reacted with monospecific anti-adhesin antibody. The 200 kDa protein also reacted with anti-beta-galactosidase IgG, indicating that it is a fusion protein of which 84 kDa represents the streptococcal adhesin. The 84 and 53 kDa proteins are similar in size to the major polypeptides in a streptococcal antigen complex which is associated with the adhesion of G9B to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. The 53 kDa fragment may result from post-translational cleavage of the recombinant polypeptide.
TI  - The streptokinase gene of group A streptococci: cloning, expression in Escherichia coli, and sequence analysis.
AB  - The gene specifying the group A streptokinase (ska) gene was cloned from an M type 49 strain of Streptococcus pyogenes and shown to express in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequence of the DNA fragment carrying ska was determined and compared to that of the group C streptokinase gene (skc). There is 90% sequence identity between the two genes, with highly conserved transcription and translation control regions. The deduced amino acid sequence of the group A streptokinase (SKA) contains the same number of amino acids as that of group C streptokinase, with 85% sequence identity between the two proteins. Among 440 amino acid residues specified by the coding sequence, there are 62 non-identical residues with 45 conserved and 17 non-conserved residues. The non-identical residues are located in two major regions, spanning residues 174 to 244 and 270 to 290, with 40 and 10 amino acid changes, respectively. The sequence differences provide an explanation at the molecular level for the previous findings of immunological and chemical heterogeneity among streptokinase produced by pathogenic streptococci.
TI  - Fibrinogen binding and resistance to phagocytosis of Streptococcus sanguis expressing cloned M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - The biological properties of Streptococcus pyogenes M protein cloned and expressed in S. sanguis were investigated. The spm-5 gene previously cloned into Escherichia coli was subcloned into the E. coli-S. sanguis shuttle plasmid pVA838 to produce a newly constructed plasmid, pBK100. Cells of S. sanguis transformed with pBK100 expressed 53-, 55-, and 58-kilodalton polypeptides reacting with type 5 M protein antiserum in immunoblots. The M protein was expressed on the surface of S. sanguis cells as shown by the capacity of the intact cells to (i) inhibit the reactivity of anti-type 5 antibodies with purified M protein as demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; (ii) inhibit the opsonization by M5 antisera of type 5 S. pyogenes; (iii) express M-protein-like fibrils on the surface of the organisms that react with M5 antisera as revealed by immunoelectron microscopy; (iv) bind plasma fibrinogen and, as a consequence, resist phagocytosis by human blood neutrophils; and (v) be rendered susceptible to phagocytosis by opsonic M5 antisera. These results provide additional evidence that streptococcal M proteins bind host proteins as a ploy to evade host defense mechanisms.
TI  - Cloning of the gene encoding streptococcal immunoglobulin A protease and its expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - We have identified and cloned a 6-kilobase-pair segment of chromosomal DNA from Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556 that encodes immunoglobulin A (IgA) protease activity when cloned into Escherichia coli. The enzyme specified by the iga gene in plasmid pJG1 accumulates in the periplasm of E. coli MM294 cells and has a substrate specificity for human IgA1 identical to that of native S. sanguis protease. Hybridization experiments with probes from within the encoding DNA showed no detectable homology at the nucleotide sequence level with chromosomal DNA of gram-negative bacteria that excrete IgA protease. Moreover, the S. sanguis iga gene probes showed no detectable hybridization with chromosomal DNA of S. pneumoniae, although the IgA proteases of these two streptococcal species cleaved the identical peptide bond in the human IgA1 heavy-chain hinge region.
TI  - A polysaccharide from Streptococcus sanguis 34 that inhibits coaggregation of S.  sanguis 34 with Actinomyces viscosus T14V.
AB  - Coaggregation between Actinomyces viscosus T14V and Streptococcus sanguis 34 depends on interaction of a lectin on A. viscosus T14V with a cell surface carbohydrate on S. sanguis 34. This carbohydrate was isolated, and its chemical makeup was established. The carbohydrate remained attached to S. sanguis 34 cells through extraction with Triton X-100 and treatment with pronase. It was cleaved from the cell residue by autoclaving and purified by differential centrifugation and column chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel and Sephadex G-75. The polysaccharide contained phosphate which was neither inorganic nor monoester. Treatment with NaOH-NaBH4, followed by Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase, or with 48% HF at 4 degrees C, followed by NaBH4, yielded inorganic phosphate and oligosaccharide alditols. Therefore, the polysaccharide is composed of oligosaccharide units joined together by phosphodiester bridges. The structure and stereochemistry of the main oligosaccharide alditol was established previously (F. C. McIntire, C. A. Bush, S.-S. Wu, S.-C. Li, Y.-T. Li, M. McNeil, S. Tjoa, and P. V. Fennessey, Carbohydr. Res. 166:133-143). Permethylation analysis, 1H and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance studies on the whole polysaccharide revealed the position of the phosphodiester linkages. The polysaccharide is mainly a polymer of (6) GalNAc(alpha 1-3)Rha(beta 1-4)Glc(beta 1-6)Galf(beta 1-6)GalNAc(beta 1- 3)Gal(alpha 1)-OPO3. It reacted as a single antigen with antiserum to S. sanguis 34 cells and was a potent inhibitor of coaggregation between A. viscosus T14V and S. sanguis 34. Quantitative inhibition of precipitation assays with oligosaccharides, O-allyl N-acetylgalactosaminides, and simple sugars indicated that specific antibodies were directed to the GalNAc end of the hexasaccharide unit. In contrast, coaggregation was inhibited much more effectively by saccharides containing betaGalNAc. Thus, the specificity of the A. viscosus T14V lectin is strikingly different from that of antibodies directed against the S. sanguis 34 polysaccharide.
TI  - Cloning of a Streptococcus sanguis adhesin which mediates binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite.
AB  - Chromosomal DNA from a salivary aggregating strain of Streptococcus sanguis 12 was partially digested with PstI and ligated into the plasmid vector pUC18 and transformed into Escherichia coli JM83. A total of 1,700 recombinant clones of E. coli were examined by a colony immunoassay with antisera raised against either S. sanguis 12 whole cells or S. sanguis 12 surface fibrils. Five clones which reacted with one or the other antiserum were shown to be unique by Western blotting (immunoblotting) and restriction endonuclease digestion. One recombinant plasmid pSA2 expressed two proteins with Mrs of 20,000 and 36,000. The 36,000-Mr protein has been designated SsaB. Both proteins were purified to homogeneity by Sephadex G-75 and ion-exchange chromatography. The proteins were present in mutanolysin digests of whole-cell lysates of S. sanguis 12 and in the non-saliva-aggregating variant 12na and the hydrophilic variant 12L. Polyclonal antiserum raised against the SsaB protein reacted strongly with the cell surfaces of S. sanguis 12 and 12na but not with that of 12L. SsaB inhibited the adhesion of S. sanguis 12na to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite, indicating that the adhesin mediates the binding to the pH-sensitive receptor.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the tetracycline resistance determinant of and several promoters from within the conjugative transposon Tn919.
AB  - Tn919 is a 15- to 16-kilobase (kb) tetracycline resistance conjugative transposon that was originally isolated from Streptococcus sanguis FC1. The tetracycline resistance determinant (tet) was found on a 4.2-kb HindII fragment by in vitro deletion analysis. This fragment was subcloned to a pWV01 origin capable of directing replication in Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Streptococcus lactis, and expression was observed in all three genera. In all cases, expression was weaker when only the 4.2-kb cloned fragment rather than the full transposon was present. The resistance gene is of the streptococcal tetM class and codes for a protein of approximately 70 kilodaltons. The restriction map resembles that of the tetM gene of Tn1545 (P. Martin, P. Trieu-Cuot, and P. Courvalin, Nucleic Acids Res. 14:7047-7058, 1986), which codes for a protein of 72.5 kilodaltons. A number of transposon-derived promoter-bearing fragments were also cloned and sequenced. These closely resemble the consensus sequence of E. coli and B. subtilis promoters. Fusion experiments with a truncated lacZ gene indicate the possibility of an open reading frame for one of the promoters.
TI  - Host-vector system for integration of recombinant DNA into chromosomes of transformable and nontransformable streptococci.
AB  - We describe a genetic system in which transformation of Streptococcus pneumoniae  and Streptococcus sanguis was used to insert recombinant DNA into the conjugative chromosomal element omega (cat tetM) 6001 (omega 6001). The element containing the recombinant DNA was then transferred by conjugation to the chromosome of transformable and nontransformable streptococci. When Escherichia coli plasmid pDP36 was used as donor in transformation, it was capable of inserting 5.9 kilobases of heterologous DNA into the chromosome of competent streptococcal strains carrying omega 6001; the transformants were scored for erythromycin resistance. Genetic analysis showed that in a fraction of the erythromycin-resistant transformants the integration via flanking homology of the heterologous DNA caused inactivation of the tetM gene of omega 6001. By analyzing the stability of the resistance markers, we found that stable integration of heterologous DNA was achieved only in the erythromycin-resistant, tetracycline-sensitive transformants. It was possible to detect conjugal transfer of the heterologous sequences from stable transformants to strains of S. pneumoniae, S. sanguis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus faecalis. The omega 6001-pDP36 host-vector system opens new possibilities for gene transfer in streptococci. By this method cloned streptococcal DNA (possibly mutagenized in vitro) can be returned to the original host, greatly facilitating complementation tests and fine physiological studies.
TI  - Evidence for natural gene transfer from gram-positive cocci to Escherichia coli.
AB  - High-level resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin type B (MLS) antibiotics in Escherichia coli BM2570 is due to the presence on the conjugative plasmid pIP1527 of the MLS resistance determinant ermBC, which is almost identical to the erm genes previously described in plasmid pAM77 from Streptococcus sanguis (ermAM) and in transposon Tn917 from Enterococcus faecalis (ermB). This gene and its regulatory region are located downstream from the insertion sequence IS1. The 23S rRNA methylase encoded by pIP1527 differs by three and six amino acids from those encoded by Tn917 and pAM77, respectively. Unlike the streptococcal elements which confer the inducible MLS phenotype, the ermBC gene is expressed constitutively in E. coli and Bacillus subtilis, due to several mutations in the regulatory region. Transcription of the ermBC gene starts from three different sites following three overlapping promoters which function in both E. coli and B. subtilis. Promoters P2 and P3 are located within the region homologous to pAM77 and Tn917, and P1 is a hybrid promoter constituted by -35 and -10 sequences located at the end of IS15 and in the streptococcal region, respectively. These results constitute evidence for the recent in vivo transfer from Streptococcus spp. to E. coli. This transfer could have been mediated by transposons such as Tn917 or Tn1545 from Streptococcus pneumoniae, which also bears an MLS determinant that is homologous to ermB. We speculate that the insertion sequences IS15 and IS1 could have played a role in the expression and dissemination of ermBC, which has been found in numerous strains of enterobacteria.
TI  - Conjugal transfer of group B streptococcal plasmids and comobilization of Escherichia coli-Streptococcus shuttle plasmids to Lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  - The antibiotic resistance group B streptococcal plasmids, pIP501 and pVA797, were conjugally transferred from Streptococcus faecalis to Lactobacillus plantarum. The Escherichia coli-Streptococcus shuttle plasmids, pVA838 and pSA3, were mobilized from S. sanguis to L. plantarum by pVA797 via cointegrate formation. pVA838 readily resolved from pVA797 and was present in L. plantarum as deletion derivatives. The pVA797::pSA3 cointegrate failed to resolve in L. plantarum.
TI  - Expression of the human interferon-alpha 1 gene under transcriptional and translational control of the speA gene.
AB  - The human gene for mature interferon-alpha 1 (IFN-alpha 1) was inserted in a new  transcription-translation fusion vector system based on the expression and secretion signals of the gene for type A streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin, speA. As deduced from the known nucleotide sequences of the component elements, the encoded IFN-alpha 1 was a fusion protein carrying an N-terminal extension of 17 amino acids. When inserted in appropriate vectors capable of replication in Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus sanguis, this expression configuration directed the synthesis of antiviral activity in all 3 organisms, as judged by the cythopathic effect inhibition assay of Vesicular Stomatitis Virus. In E. coli JM101, IFN activity was found mainly in the cytoplasmic protein fraction whereas in the gram-positive hosts, it was completely secreted into the culture medium.
TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Streptococcus  sanguis of a gene for staphylokinase--a bacterial plasminogen activator.
AB  - The gene coding for the bacterial plasminogen activator staphylokinase was cloned from the Staphylococcus aureus phage 42D, a serogroup F phage used for lysotyping, onto the standard Escherichia coli plasmid vector pACYC184. The coding and flanking sequences of the sak42D gene were largely identical to those of a sak gene cloned from the serologically different S. aureus phage SoC (Sako and Tsuchida 1983). Subcloning of a 2.5 kb phage 42D DNA fragment onto plasmid pGB3631 allowed the sak42D gene to be introduced into the gram-positive hosts Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus sanguis. The sak42D gene was expressed and secreted most efficiently by B. subtilis cells (25 micrograms/ml of culture supernatant) reduced in exoprotease production. In this host expression and secretion of Sak was initiated at the early growth phase and continued through the logarithmic phase. Formation of Sak was, however, also observed with the other cloning hosts. The Sak elaborated by the heterologous hosts was serologically identical with authentic Sak derived from S. aureus.
TI  - Molecular basis of bacterial adhesion in the oral cavity.
AB  - The two varieties of fimbriae identified on oral strains of actinomyces have distinct functional properties. The type 1 fimbriae of Actinomyces viscosus T14V mediate attachment to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite. Type 2 fimbriae--on A. viscosus and the only fimbriae detected on A. naeslundii WVU45--are associated with lectin activity. Interaction of these fimbriae with complementary receptors initiates bacterial attachment to Streptococcus sanguis 34 and sialidase-treated epithelial cells and the killing of actinomyces by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). Galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), and related oligosaccharides inhibit these processes, and mutants lacking type 2 fimbriae do not participate in them. The actinomyces lectin is similar to lectins from Ricinus communis and Bauhinia purpurea that agglutinate certain strains of oral streptococci, block attachment of actinomyces to epithelial cells, and inhibit killing of actinomyces by PMNs. The S. sanguis receptor for the actinomyces lectin comprises repeating hexasaccharide units with GalNAc termini. Used as probes, the peanut agglutinin, with specificity for Gal(beta-3)GalNAc, and the lectin from B. purpurea detect a 160-kilodalton (kdal) band in SDS-PAGE-separated epithelial cell extracts and a 100-kdal band in PMN extracts. These may be receptors for type 2 fimbriae. A. viscosus genes encoding subunits of types 1 and 2 fimbriae have been cloned in Escherichia coli; the type 1 subunit is 65 kdal and the type 2 subunit is 59 kdal. Submandibular immunization of mice with a mixture of type 1 and type 2 fimbriae evokes the production of IgA and IgG antibodies in serum and saliva that inhibit in vitro adsorption of A. viscosus to SHA. These antibodies may modulate colonization of teeth by this organism.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of a Streptococcus sanguis DNase necessary for repair of DNA damage induced by UV light and methyl methanesulfonate.
AB  - We developed a method for cloning cellular nucleases from streptococci. Recombinant lambda gt11 bacteriophage containing streptococcal nuclease determinants were identified by the production of pink plaques on toluidine blue O DNase plates. We used this technique to clone a 3.2-kilobase-pair EcoRI fragment with DNase activity from the chromosome of Streptococcus sanguis. The locus was designated don (DNase one) and could be subcloned and stably maintained on plasmid vectors in Escherichia coli. Minicell analyses of various subclones of the don locus allowed us to determine the coding region and size of the Don nuclease in E. coli. The don gene product had an apparent molecular mass of 34 kilodaltons and degraded native DNA most efficiently, with lesser activity against denatured DNA and no detectable activity against RNA. S. sanguis don deletion mutants were constructed by transformation of competent cells with in vitro-prepared plasmid constructs. S. sanguis don deletion mutants retained normal transformation frequencies for exogenously added donor DNA. However, when compared with Don+ wild-type cells, these mutants were hypersensitive to DNA damage induced by UV light and methyl methanesulfonate. An S. sanguis don-specific DNA probe detected homology to chromosomal DNA isolated from Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mutans Bratthall serogroups d and g. Our results suggested that the don locus was the S. sanguis allele of the previously described S. pneumoniae major exonuclease and was involved in repair of DNA damage. Furthermore, hybridization studies suggested that the don locus was conserved among species of oral streptococci.
TI  - Membrane-associated and solubilized ATPases of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - The proton-translocating, membrane ATPases of oral streptococci have been implicated in cytoplasmic pH regulation, acidurance, and cariogenicity. Membranes were isolated from Streptococcus mutans GS-5 and Streptococcus sanguis NCTC 10904 following salt-induced lysis of cells treated with lysozyme and mutanolysin. The ATPase activities of these membranes were 1.8 and 1.1 units per mg membrane protein, respectively. F1 ATPases were washed free from the membranes and purified by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). Hydrolytic activities of the F1 ATPases were maximal at pH values between 6.0 and 6.6, whereas the membrane-bound enzymes had pH maxima of 7.5 (S. sanguis) and 6.0 (S. mutans). The F1 ATPases of the streptococci were similar to the well-characterized enzyme of Escherichia coli; they consisted of five different polypeptides and had apparent, aggregate molecular weights of from 335 to 350 Kd. The membrane-bound ATPases were characterized biochemically and found to be similar to those of proton-translocating ATPases of E. coli and Streptococcus faecalis. Km values for the membranes with respect to ATP were found to be 0.9 and 1.0 mmol/L for S. mutans and S. sanguis, respectively. Both enzymes had specificities for purine triphosphates and were active with a variety of divalent cations, although optimal activity occurred with ATP and Mg. The membrane-associated enzymes were sensitive to the inhibitors dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) and azide, but insensitive to ouabain and vanadate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Infection with the bacterium Streptococcus mutans and salivary IgA antibodies in  mothers and their children.
AB  - Salivary IgA-antibody titres against different streptococcal antigens were measured in 64 mothers and their first-born children. Their presence and the level of Streptococcus mutans had been monitored for several years. The children had carried this bacterium for various lengths of time and now had varying numbers of salivary Strep. mutans. The subjects had participated in a longitudinal study completed one and a half years before, concerning prevention of early colonization of the child's mouth by Strep. mutans through measures undertaken by the mother. Whole-saliva samples were collected from all subjects and analysed by ELISA techniques for total IgA, and for IgA antibodies to whole cells of Strep. mutans serotype c and d, whole cells of Strep. sanguis, purified polysaccharide and protein antigens of Strep. mutans serotype c and d; a pool of Escherichia coli antigens was used as a control. No significant differences were found in the level of any of the specific IgA antibodies in children with different levels of indigenous Strep. mutans. A tendency to higher IgA antibody activity was found in children who had levels of Strep. mutans first detectable after three years of age and who had carried the bacterium for six months or less. The IgA antibody activity to Strep. mutans specific serotype c antigen and to whole cells of Strep. mutans serotype c (JC 2) was significantly higher in children with no caries experience when compared to children with more than two df-surfaces. This study offers no clear evidence for a protective role of salivary IgA antibodies against Strep. mutans colonization.
TI  - Expression of Streptococcus sanguis antigens in Escherichia coli: cloning of a structural gene for adhesion fimbriae.
AB  - Chromosomal DNA from Streptococcus sanguis FW213 was partially digested with EcoRI and ligated into the positive-selection cloning vector pOP203(A2+). The ligation mixture was used to transform Escherichia coli K-12, and 4,500 transformants were examined. The tetracycline-resistant colonies had inserts averaging 3.2 kilobases. The entire colony bank was screened by colony immunoassay with polyclonal rabbit serum raised against S. sanguis FW213 whole cells. Thirty recombinant colonies produced stable positive reactions of various intensities, indicating that S. sanguis antigens could be expressed in E. coli. Restriction endonuclease digestion of these clones suggested that 26 of the clones were unique. Only two clones, VT616 and VT618, gave positive reactions with fimbria-specific antisera. That the gene coding for the antigen was located on the plasmid was confirmed by demonstrating that the presence of the plasmid was linked to antigen production. Western immunoblot analyses of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels showed that both clones produced a fimbrial peptide of Mr 30,000. The two recombinant plasmids were shown by Southern analysis and restriction mapping to contain the same 6-kilobase EcoRI fragment inserted in opposite orientations. Southern hybridization confirmed that this fragment is present in S. sanguis genomic DNA. The Mr 30,000 protein gene was expressed in both orientations, suggesting that the fimbrial promoter is located on the 6-kilobase fragment. These results show that at least one streptococcal fimbrial gene can be cloned and expressed in E. coli.
TI  - Reconstitution of ATP-dependent calcium transport from streptococci.
AB  - Membrane vesicles of three streptococcal strains (Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus lactis, and Streptococcus sanguis) were extracted with octyl-beta-D-glucoside in the presence of Escherichia coli lipid and glycerol. For reconstitution, the detergent extract was mixed with bath-sonicated E. coli lipid, in the presence of octyl-beta-D-glucoside, and proteoliposomes were formed by a 25-fold dilution. ATP-dependent calcium accumulation by proteoliposomes was comparable to that found in parent vesicles. Recovery of this calcium transport activity was dependent on the inclusion of an osmolyte protein stabilant (glycerol, etc.) during solubilization. The properties of ATP-driven calcium transport were studied in the reconstituted system. In proteoliposomes, ATP-linked calcium accumulation was not affected by the protonophore, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, or by the ionophores, valinomycin and nigericin, in the presence of potassium, or by N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, an inhibitor of the F0F1-ATPase. On the other hand, calcium transport was completely blocked by micromolar levels of orthovanadate; half-maximal inhibitions were observed at 0.4, 4, and 4 microM vanadate, for S. faecalis, S. lactis, and S. sanguis, respectively. This marked sensitivity to orthovanadate suggests operation of an E1E2-type ion-motive pump. These data demonstrate that, in a reconstituted system, calcium transport is not linked to an ATP-dependent proton circulation via the F0F1-ATPase, but rather is driven by a calcium-translocating ATPase. Thus, calcium extrusion from the cytosol of enteric, lactic acid, or oral streptococci is mediated by an ATP-linked process analogous to the ion-motive ATPases of eukaryotic membranes.
TI  - ATP-driven calcium transport in membrane vesicles of Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - Calcium transport was investigated in membrane vesicles prepared from the oral bacterium Streptococcus sanguis. Procedures were devised for the preparation of membrane vesicles capable of accumulating 45Ca2+. Uptake was ATP dependent and did not require a proton motive force. Calcium transport in these vesicles was compared with 45Ca2+ accumulation in membrane vesicles from Streptococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli. The data support the existence of an ATP-driven calcium pump in S. sanguis similar to that in S. faecalis. This pump, which catalyzes uptake into membrane vesicles, would be responsible for extrusion of calcium from intact cells.
TI  - Molecular and genetic characterization of lactose-metabolic genes of Streptococcus cremoris.
AB  - Lac+ plasmid DNA from Streptococcus cremoris H2 was subcloned with an Escherichia coli vector on a 3.5-kilobase-pair PstI-AvaI fragment. Genetic analysis of the cloned DNA was possible because linear Lac+ DNA fragments were productive in the S. sanguis transformation system. Complementation of S. sanguis Lac-mutants showed that the 3.5-kilobase-pair fragment included the structural gene for 6-phospho-beta-D-galactosidase and either enzyme II-lac or factor III-lac of the lactose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system. Expression of the S. cremoris-like 40,000-dalton 6-phospho-beta-D-galactosidase in S. sanguis Lac+ transformants, rather than the 52,000-dalton wild-type S. sanguis enzyme, demonstrated the occurrence of gene replacement and not gene repair. The evidence supports chromosomal integration as the mechanism by which S. sanguis Lac- recipients are converted to a Lac+ phenotype after transformation with Lac+ DNA. Southern blot data suggest that the Lac+ DNA does not reside on a transposon, but that integration always occurs within a specific HincII fragment of the recipient chromosome. Hybridization experiments demonstrate homology between the S. cremoris Lac+ DNA and cellular DNA from Lac+ strains of Streptococcus lactis, S. mutans, S. faecalis, and S. sanguis.
TI  - Coagglutination reactions between Candida albicans and oral bacteria.
AB  - An agglutination assay for detecting intermicrobial adherence between the cells of Candida albicans and various oral bacteria is described. Strains of Streptococcus sanguis, S. salivarius, S. mutans, S. mitis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces viscosus all coagglutinated with C. albicans. No interaction could be demonstrated between the cells of Bacteroides melaninogenicus and those of C. albicans. Preliminary investigations of these interactions suggest that binding of F. nucleatum and A. viscosus to C. albicans is mediated by bacterial proteins, possibly lectins. Other mechanisms must account for the binding of oral streptococci to C. albicans. The possible implications of these findings in relation to oral mucosal colonisation and oral candidal clearance are discussed.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of scrB, the structural gene for the Streptococcus mutans phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sucrose phosphotransferase system sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase.
AB  - A DNA fragment encoding the sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase component of the Streptococcus mutans phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sucrose phosphotransferase system has been recovered from a plasmid-based genomic library of strain GS5. The locus, designated scrB, was found to reside within a 2.9-kilobase-pair restriction fragment present on the chimeric molecule pVA1343 (7.3 kilobase pairs). Minicell analysis of pVA1343-directed translation products revealed that the scrB product synthesized in Escherichia coli V1343 was a single peptide of Mr 57,000. This polypeptide was reactive with antiserum prepared against S. mutans intracellular invertase, which has been previously shown to have an Mr of 43,000 to 48,000. The basis of this difference in Mr was not established but may represent a posttranslational proteolytic event which occurred in S. mutans but not in recombinant V1343. Sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase purified to homogeneity from V1343 exhibited Michaelis constants of 180 mM for sucrose and 0.08 mM for sucrose-6-phosphate. Deletion analysis of pVA1343 facilitated the assignment of a coding region for the hydrolase within the insert, as well as an orientation for the transcription of scrB. scrB-defective strains of S. mutans constructed by additive integration of an insertionally inactivated scrB locus exhibited the sucrose sensitivity characteristic of this mutant class. Similar loci were detected by DNA-DNA hybridization in additional strains of S. mutans and two strains of Streptococcus cricetus, but not in single strain representatives of S. rattus, S. sobrinus, S. sanguis I and II, S. salivarius, or S. mitis.
TI  - Highly efficient protoplast transformation system for Streptococcus faecalis and  a new Escherichia coli-S. faecalis shuttle vector.
AB  - A highly efficient protoplast transformation system for Streptococcus faecalis has been developed by systematically optimizing different parameters. Up to 10(6) transformants per micrograms of DNA were consistently obtained within 3 days, and cell wall regeneration of protoplasts was virtually 100%. A systematic search for useful vectors showed that the broad-host-range plasmid pIP501 could transform S. faecalis at a high frequency (6.3 X 10(4) transformants per microgram). By combining a high-copy-number derivative of pIP501, designated pGB354, with the Escherichia coli vector pACYC184, we constructed a new E. coli-S. faecalis shuttle vector (pAM401) having nine unique restriction sites. In a shotgun cloning experiment, we ligated a tetracycline resistance determinant from Streptococcus sanguis chromosomal DNA into pAM401 by direct transformation of S. faecalis, establishing the utility of the protoplast transformation system and of the new shuttle vector.
TI  - Some remarks about laser-induced mass spectrometry of bacteria.
AB  - In order to investigate the availability of laser-induced mass spectrometry for the determination of bacteria, ten strains of the genera Escherichia and Streptococcus were chosen. Gram-negative as well as Gram-positive lysogenic and non-lysogenic, pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains were examined. Giant pulses of a Nd: YAG laser (frequency quadrupled, wave-length 265 nm) were used to vaporize and partly ionize the bacterial material. The time-of-flight mass spectra obtained could be discriminated by using the stepwise discriminant analysis provided by BMDP software package. Two different methods relating centrifugation and washing procedures were used. With the first method a correct classification between 50.0 and 90.9 per cent (S. sanguis) by means of mass spectra of positive ions and a correct classification between 27.1 and 80.4 per cent (S. lactis-25) by means of mass spectra of negative ions was observed. Using the second method a correct classification between 40.7 and 93.3 per cent (S. lactis-25) by means of mass spectra of positive ions and a correct classification between 56.7 and 95.0 per cent by means of mass spectra of negative ions was obtained. Here S. sanguis with 93.3 and S. lactis-25 with 81.7 per cent were significantly differentiated. In this context it must be emphasized that a correct classification of 27 per cent must be considered statistically significant, if 10 different strains are used.
TI  - Comparative adhesion of seven species of streptococci isolated from the blood of  patients with sub-acute bacterial endocarditis to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro.
AB  - The adhesion to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro of 21 strains of streptococci isolated from the blood of patients with sub-acute bacterial endocarditis (SABE) was measured. The species, in order of greatest adhesion, were Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus milleri, Streptococcus sanguis, dextran-positive Streptococcus mitior, dextran-negative Streptococcus mitior and Streptococcus salivarius. Individual strains within species, however, cannot be assumed to be representative of their species and may exhibit unusually high or low adhesion. Adhesion depended upon both bacterial concentration and period of contact. There was no simple relationship between ability to adhere and liability to cause endocarditis. Formation of dextran did not increase adhesion. The streptococci were more adhesive than strains of Escherichia coli and Neisseria sicca and less adhesive than strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.
TI  - Salivary immunoglobulin A and serum antibodies to Streptococcus mutans ribosomal  preparations in dental caries-free and caries-susceptible human subjects.
AB  - Caries-free subjects or individuals with low caries susceptibility exhibited significantly higher (P less than 0.001) levels of naturally occurring salivary immunoglobulin A (IgA) and serum IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies to a Streptococcus mutans ribosomal preparation than subjects with high caries susceptibility. Absorption of saliva and serum samples with S. mutans ribosomal preparations, but not with other S. mutans antigens or with Escherichia coli and Neisseria gonorrhoeae ribosomal preparations, removed the antibody activity. Absorption with Streptococcus sanguis ribosomes and NH4Cl-washed S. mutans ribosomes partially removed the anti-S. mutans ribosome antibody activity. These results provide evidence that naturally occurring salivary and serum antibodies to the S. mutans ribosomal preparation correlate with susceptibility to dental caries.
TI  - Construction of plasmid vectors for the detection of streptococcal promoters.
AB  - Plasmid vectors have been constructed for detecting DNA fragments that exhibit promoter activity in Streptococcus sanguis. The plasmids are able to replicate in both S. sanguis and Escherichia coli, and contain an erythromycin resistance marker which is expressed in both hosts. Selection for promoter activity is dependent upon the insertion of appropriate DNA fragments upstream from a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene (cat) from Staphylococcus aureus. To facilitate this insertion, a pair of vectors, pMU1327 and pMU1328, were constructed with the polylinker from M13mp 18 in either orientation. The to transcriptional terminator of phage lambda is present downstream from cat. Translation stop codons in all reading frames are located between the polylinker and the initiation codon of cat. These plasmids have been used to isolate DNA fragments from S. sanguis, S. lactis and S. cremoris that exhibit promoter activity in S. sanguis.
TI  - Investigation of the cytotoxicity of bacterial species implicated in pulpal inflammation.
AB  
TI  - Microbial adhesion to fibronectin in vitro correlates with production of endocarditis in rabbits.
AB  - Microbial adhesion to the constituents of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) is an important early event in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. Fibronectin is a ubiquitous mammalian glycoprotein with diverse functions which binds to certain bacteria but not to others. In this study, we determined that fibronectin is present on the surface of NBTE (after catheter-induced aortic valve trauma) but not on normal rabbit cardiac valvular endothelium. The adhesion of various bacteria and yeasts to human fibronectin in tissue culture wells was then measured. Microorganisms with a high isolation frequency from endocarditis cases (Staphylococcus aureus, Candida tropicalis, C. albicans, Streptococcus faecalis, S. sanguis) bound significantly better (P less than 0.01) to fibronectin in vitro than other organisms (Escherichia coli, C. krusei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) rarely implicated in this disease. Microbial adhesion to fibronectin correlated closely with the propensity of each organism to produce endocarditis in rabbits (e.g., ID50) with preexistent NBTE. A similar distribution was noted after binding of soluble radiolabeled fibronectin to bacteria in suspension. The results suggest that fibronectin, expressed on the surface of NBTE, may mediate microbial adhesion of circulating organisms to initiate colonization during the early pathogenesis of infective endocarditis.
TI  - Complete nucleotide sequence of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B-resistance  transposon Tn917 in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis transposon Tn917 was cloned in Escherichia coli on plasmid vector pBR325. The erythromycin resistance determinant of Tn917 was not expressed in the E. coli background. The nucleotide sequence of Tn917 was determined and found to be 5,257 base pairs in length. Six open reading frames (ORFs) were identified and designated 1 through 6 (5' to 3'); all were on the same DNA strand. A region exhibiting strong homology with known promoters was identified upstream from ORF1. ORFs 1 to 3 were virtually identical to the previously sequenced erythromycin resistance determinant on Streptococcus sanguis plasmid pAM77. At the 3' point, where the homology between Tn917 and pAM77 ends, was a 20-base-pair region about 80% homologous with a component of the res site of Tn3. The amino acid sequence of ORF4 showed homology with other site-specific recombination enzymes, including approximately 30% homology with the resolvase of Tn3. Contained within Tn917 was a directly oriented 73-base-pair duplication of the left terminus. The Tn917 sequence revealed that antibiotic-enhanced transposition might be due to extension of transcription from the resistance-related genes (in ORFs 1 to 3) into transposition genes (in ORFs 4 to 6). Transcription analyses resulted in data consistent with this interpretation.
TI  - Recovery of blood-borne bacteria from human urine.
AB  - Recovery from the urine of organisms causing bacteraemia may depend on the bacterial species involved. The survival of the more common species of bacteria which cause bacteraemia was examined in human urine, serum and normal saline. All species survived well or grew in serum. Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus sanguis and group A streptococci were killed in all urine samples. The number of colony-forming units of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and group B streptococci either remained the same or increased in the urine, while the numbers of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae increased rapidly. These data suggest that the observed differences in recovery from urine of these bacterial species that cause bacteraemia are related to the viability of the species in human urine.
TI  - Cloned gtfA gene of Streptococcus mutans LM7 alters glucan synthesis in Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans LM7 (Bratthall serotype e) chromosomal DNA was partially digested with EcoRI and ligated into the positive-selection plasmid vector pOP203(A2+). The ligation mixture was transformed into Escherichia coli, and transformants were selected for tetracycline resistance. Recombinant-bearing clones were screened for their ability to ferment raffinose, using the procedure of Robeson et al. (J. Bacteriol. 153:211-221, 1983). One raffinose-fermenting clone was isolated and found to contain a plasmid with an insert consisting of four EcoRI fragments totalling approximately 10.3 kilobases (kb). This strain was capable of growth on defined medium plus raffinose or sucrose and generated reducing sugars from a sucrose substrate. Southern hybridization analysis of the four EcoRI fragments revealed homology not only to S. mutans LM7 chromosomal DNA but also to S. mutans serotypes b, c, and f. Subcloning of this fragment array into a streptococcal E. coli shuttle vector indicated that a 2.4-kb EcoRI fragment was essential for sucrase activity. E. coli minicell experiments revealed a gene product of 55 kilodaltons. These data along with restriction endonuclease analysis and Southern hybridizations suggested that the cloned S. mutans LM7 gene was closely related to the gtfA gene cloned by Robeson et al. from S. mutans PS13 (Bratthall serotype c). The shuttle plasmid containing the 2.4-kb fragment was transformed into Streptococcus sanguis, which subsequently displayed increased sucrase activity in both intracellular and extracellular fractions. Elevated levels of synthesis of alcohol-insoluble and water-insoluble glucans were observed with crude extracellular fractions of the S. sanguis strain bearing the 2.4-kb fragment. An isolate cured of the shuttle plasmid plus the 2.4-kb fragment displayed wild-type S. sanguis glucan synthesis. In S. sanguis, this gtfA allele may play a role in glucan synthesis by interacting with extant high-molecular-weight glucosyltransferases.
TI  - Characterization and molecular cloning of cryptic plasmids isolated from Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - Four small cryptic plasmids were isolated from Lactobacillus casei strains, and restriction endonuclease maps of these plasmids were constructed. Three of the small plasmids (pLZ18C, pLZ19E, and pLZ19F1; 6.4, 4.9, and 4.8 kilobase pairs, respectively) were cloned into Escherichia coli K-12 by using pBR322, pACYC184, and pUC8 as vectors. Two of the plasmids, pLZ18C and pLZ19E, were also cloned into Streptococcus sanguis by using pVA1 as the vector. Hybridization by using nick-translated cloned 32P-labeled L. casei plasmid DNA as the probe revealed that none of the cryptic plasmids had appreciable DNA-DNA homology with the large lactose plasmids found in the L. casei strains, with chromosomal DNAs isolated from these strains. Partial homology was detected among several plasmids isolated from different strains, but not among cryptic plasmids isolated from the same strain.
TI  - Transformation and fusion of Streptococcus faecalis protoplasts.
AB  - Nonconjugative plasmids were transferred by protoplast fusion among Streptococcus faecalis strains and from Streptococcus sanguis to S. faecalis. S. faecalis protoplasts were also transformed with several different plasmids, including the Tn917 delivery vehicle pTV1. Transformation was reproducible, but low in frequency (10(-6) transformants per viable protoplast). A new shuttle vector (pAM610), able to replicate in Escherichia coli and S. faecalis, was constructed and transformed into S. faecalis protoplasts. pAM610 was mobilized by the conjugative plasmid pAM beta 1 in matings among S. faecalis strains and from S. sanguis to S. faecalis. Chimeric derivatives of pAM610 were also transformed into S. faecalis.
TI  - Chemical properties and immunobiological activities of streptococcal lipoteichoic acids.
AB  - Lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) were chromatographically purified from crude phenol-water extract of whole cells of some streptococcal species, which included Streptococcus pyogenes Sv, Streptococcus mutans 6715, and Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556. Among these, special attention was paid to S. pyogenes LTA for analyses of chemical composition and biological activities. All LTA preparations contained equimolar amounts of glycerol and phosphorus. Chemical analyses showed that S. pyogenes LTA contained glycerophosphate, alanine, glucose, and fatty acids (as palmitic acid) at molar ratio of 1 : 0.1 : 0.1 : 0.25. The crude phenol-water extract and isolated LTA from S. pyogenes Sv were found to be mitogenic for spleen cells of BALB/c and BALB/c (nu/nu) mice, but not for thymus cells of BALB/c mice. The mitogenicity of deacylated LTA (dLTA) was significantly lower than that of LTA. It was also found that various LTA preparations possessed polyclonal B cell activation ability and adjuvant activity both in vivo and in vitro, as demonstrated by using hemolytic plaque assay. LTA, but not dLTA, induced macrophage activation which resulted in tumor cytotoxicity in mice. Limulus lysate activity of S. pyogenes LTA was approximately 1,000 fold lower than that of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. These results indicate that streptococcal LTA possesses various immunobiological activities that modulate lymphoreticular system in vivo and in vitro.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - A conjugative transposon (Tn919) in Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - Streptococcus sanguis FC1, originally isolated from dental plaque, was found to be naturally resistant to tetracycline. Although no plasmid DNA could be detected, tetracycline resistance was transferable in filter matings to Streptococcus faecalis FA2-2. Again, no plasmid DNA was detectable in transconjugants, and the latter could donate tetracycline resistance to S. faecalis, S. sanguis, and Streptococcus lactis. The tetracycline resistance element was able to transpose to several sites on the S. faecalis hemolysin plasmid pAD1 and in each case resulted in a 15-kilobase insert. DNA filter blot hybridization studies showed that the element bears significant homology with the conjugative transposon Tn916. Designated Tn919, it was cloned into an Escherichia coli plasmid vector (pGL101) and, as has been shown for Tn916, excised readily in the absence of selective pressure.
TI  - Expression in Escherichia coli of streptococcal plasmid-determined erythromycin resistance directed by the cat gene promoter of pACYC 184.
AB  - The streptococcal erythromycin resistance (Emr) plasmid pSM7 (6.4 kb) and the E.  coli vector pACYC184 (4.0 kb) were fused at their single EcoRI sites to form the bifunctional chimeric plasmid pSM7184 (10.4 kb) in which the Emr determinant was placed under control of the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (cat) promoter of pACYC184. In the sense orientation (orientation I) of pSM7, the cat promoter directed expression of Emr in the E. coli host strains 294 and DB11 more efficiently than did the indigenous transcription signals of pSM7, which were functional in the opposite orientation II. In Streptococcus sanguis (Challis), the level of Emr was independent of the orientation of pSM7 in pACYC184, showing that the cat promoter was not recognized in the gram-positive host. The growth of E. coli (pSM7184I) in a defined medium containing glycerol as carbon source, or containing glucose plus extraneous cyclic 3'-5' adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) led to an Emr level which was 15-30 times higher than that of cultures grown on glucose. These results showed that under control of the cat promoter, Emr is subject to cAMP-mediated catabolite repression and provided conclusive evidence that the enhancement of Emr expression in E. coli carrying pSM7184I is controlled at the transcriptional level. Besides enabling us to determine the orientation of transcription of the Emr gene in pSM7 and related vectors, this work also made available new bifunctional cloning vehicles able to replicate in both E. coli and S. sanguis.
TI  - Streptococcus-Escherichia coli shuttle vector pSA3 and its use in the cloning of  streptococcal genes.
AB  - A shuttle vector that can replicate in both Streptococcus spp. and Escherichia coli has been constructed by joining the E. coli plasmid pACYC184 (chloramphenicol and tetracycline resistance) to the streptococcal plasmid pGB305 (erythromycin resistance). The resulting chimeric plasmid is designated pSA3 (chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and tetracycline resistance) and has seven unique restriction sites: EcoRI, EcoRV, BamHI, SalI, XbaI, NruI, and SphI. Molecular cloning into the EcoRI or EcoRV site results in inactivation of chloramphenicol resistance, and cloning into the BamHI, SalI, or SphI site results in inactivation of tetracycline resistance in E. coli. pSA3 was transformed and was stable in Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans in the presence of erythromycin. We have used pSA3 to construct a library of the S. mutans GS5 genome in E. coli, and expression of surface antigens in this heterologous host has been confirmed with S. mutans antiserum. A previously cloned determinant that specifies streptokinase was subcloned into pSA3, and this recombinant plasmid was stable in the presence of a selective pressure and expressed streptokinase activity in E. coli, S. sanguis (Challis), and S. mutans.
TI  - Molecular cloning of a pIP501 derivative yields a model replicon for the study of streptococcal conjugation.
AB  - We have previously constructed a derivative of the broad host range streptococcal plasmid pIP501, a conjugative plasmid designated pVA797, that confers chloramphenicol resistance and contains a unique EcoRI site in a non-essential region of the plasmid molecule. pVA797 (30.7 kb) when cloned in toto as an EcoRI fragment into the positive selection vector pOP203(A2+) gave a recombinant, pVA904 (37.7 kb), which was able to replicate in Escherichia coli and in streptococcal species. It can be phenotypically monitored in either genus by specific drug resistance markers (chloramphenicol resistance in streptococci, tetracycline resistance in E. coli). pVA904 segregates into E. coli minicells where it specifies the production of at least 13 polypeptides. Many of the polypeptides are missing in minicells containing a transfer-defective, deletion derivative of pVA904. pVA904 is an ideal model replicon for the study of streptococcal conjugation because it is a shuttle plasmid thus enabling manipulation using procedures established for E. coli. Specifically, it should be possible to define the genetic basis of streptococcal conjugation by coupling mutagenesis protocols and minicell protein analyses in E. coli with evaluation of transfer function in streptococci.
TI  - Ion extrusion systems in bacteria.
AB  
TI  - Return of Streptococcus faecalis DNA cloned in Escherichia coli to its original host via transformation of Streptococcus sanguis followed by conjugative mobilization.
AB  - Cloning vectors were introduced into Streptococcus faecalis by conjugation. A conjugative plasmid (pVA797) and cloning vector pVA838 recombined in Streptococcus sanguis at homologous sequences, forming a cointegrate. The pVA797::pVA838 cointegrate transferred to S. faecalis by conjugation. Recombination between homologous sequences resolved the cointegrate in the S. faecalis transconjugants, and pVA797 and pVA838 segregated because of incompatibility. S. faecalis strains that received pVA838 by this mechanism contained plasmids indistinguishable from authentic pVA838 from Escherichia coli. Other plasmids, including pVA736, were introduced into S. faecalis by this method. This approach should facilitate the introduction of cloned DNA into S. faecalis.
TI  - Isolation of a novel protein involved in the transport of fructose by an inducible phosphoenolpyruvate fructose phosphotransferase system in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Fructose transport in Streptococcus mutans LG-1 is mediated by at least two distinct phosphoenolpyruvate fructose phosphotransferase systems. One system is constitutive and consists of membrane components enzyme II as well as enzyme I and heat-stable protein. The other system is inducible and requires, in addition to enzyme I and heat-stable protein, a soluble substrate-specific protein for catalytic activity. This protein factor, designated IIIfru, was purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, molecular sieving on Sephadex G-75, and preparative electrophoresis. The purified preparation showed only one protein band, with a molecular weight of 12,600, on sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, on gel electrophoresis with the discontinuous buffer Tris-glycine, and after electrofocusing in gel (pI congruent to 3.7). The molecular weight of the native protein determined by gel filtration at 4 degrees C was 51,000. Immunodiffusion experiments performed with immunoglobulins prepared against the purified IIIfru from S. mutans LG-1 suggested that other S. mutans strains possessed a IIIfru. No precipitin bands, however, were detected with extracts from S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. lactis, S. faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus casei, and Escherichia coli.
TI  - The gene for type A streptococcal exotoxin (erythrogenic toxin) is located in bacteriophage T12.
AB  - The infection of Streptococcus pyogenes T25(3) with the temperate bacteriophage T12 results in the conversion of the nontoxigenic strain to type A streptococcal exotoxin (erythrogenic toxin) production. Although previous research has established that integration of the bacteriophage genome into the host chromosome is not essential for exotoxin production, the location of the gene on the bacteriophage or bacterial chromosome had not been determined. In the present investigation, recombinant DNA techniques were used to determine whether the gene specifying type A streptococcal exotoxin (speA) production is located on the bacteriophage chromosome. Bacteriophage T12 was obtained from S. pyogenes T25(3)(T12) by induction with mitomycin C, and after isolation of bacteriophage DNA by phenol-chloroform extraction, the DNA was digested with restriction enzymes and ligated with Escherichia coli plasmid pHP34 or the Streptococcus-E. coli shuttle vector pSA3. Transformation of E. coli HB101 with the recombinant molecules allowed selection of E. coli clones containing bacteriophage T12 genes. Immunological assays with specific antibody revealed the presence of type A streptococcal exotoxin in sonicates of E. coli transformants. Subcloning experiments localized the speA gene to a 1.7-kilobase segment of the bacteriophage T12 genome flanked by SalI and HindIII sites. Introduction of the pSA3 vector containing the speA gene into Streptococcus sanguis (Challis) resulted in transformants that secreted the type A exotoxin. Immunological analysis showed that the type A streptococcal exotoxin produced by E. coli and S. sanguis transformants was identical to the type A exotoxin produced by S. pyogenes T25(3)(T12). Southern blot hybridizations with the cloned fragment confirmed its presence in the bacteriophage T12 genome and its absence in the T25(3) nonlysogen. Therefore, the gene for type A streptococcal exotoxin is located in the bacteriophage genome, and conversion of S. pyogenes T25(3) to toxigenicity occurs in a manner similar to the conversion of Corynebacterium diphtheriae to toxigenicity by bacteriophage beta.
TI  - Characterization and expression of a cloned tetracycline resistance determinant from the chromosome of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - A chromosomal tetracycline resistance (Tcr) determinant previously cloned from Streptococcus mutans into Streptococcus sanguis (Tobian and Macrina, J. Bacteriol. 152:215-222, 1982) was characterized by using restriction endonuclease mapping, deletion analysis, and Southern blot hybridization. Deletion analysis allowed localization of the Tcr determinant to a 2.8-kilobase region of the originally cloned 10.4-kilobase sequence. This cloned determinant hybridized to a representative of the tetM class of streptococcal Tcr determinants but not to representatives of the tetL and tetN classes and, like other tetM determinants, mediated high-level resistance to tetracycline and low-level resistance to minocycline. A portion (approximately 3 kilobases) of the isolated streptococcal fragment was subcloned into Escherichia coli, where it conferred resistance to tetracycline and minocycline. Two proteins with apparent molecular weights of 33,000 and 35,000, encoded by the S. mutans DNA, were synthesized in E. coli minicells. Insertion of DNA into a unique SstI site of the cloned S. mutans fragment resulted in inactivation of Tcr expression in E. coli and S. sanguis, as well as loss of production of both the 33,000- and 35,000-dalton proteins in E. coli minicells. Incubation of minicells in subinhibitory concentrations of tetracycline did not result in changes in the levels of synthesis of either protein. Our data suggest that at least one of these proteins is involved in the expression of Tcr.
TI  - [Effect of solid substrates of microbial colony development].
AB  - Bacteria have been found to grow differently at contact sites to both organic and anorganic solids as on pure agar media. Of 16 ad hoc selected bacterial strains, the following species (arranged in decreasing order) responded with stronger colony formation: Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Streptococcus sanguis, S. saprophyticus, S. faecalis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus flavus, Actinomyces viscosus, Veillonella sp., Enterobacter liquefaciens, Yersinia enterocolitica. Lactobacillus casei behaved neutral. Proteus vulgaris, Y. enterocolitica and Chromobacterium violaceum grow on certain media only in the presence of solid particles. The yeasts Endomyces lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and Cryptococcus nigricans did not respond to solid particles during colony formation. The kind of protein-animal (meat) or vegetable (soy beans)-did not influence the behaviour of the microorganisms in these experiments.
TI  - Physical and genetic analyses of streptococcal plasmid pAM beta 1 and cloning of  its replication region.
AB  - Plasmid pAM beta 1, originally isolated from Streptococcus faecalis DS5, mediates resistance to the MLS (macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B alpha) group of antibiotics. A restriction endonuclease map of the 26.5-kilobase (kb) pAM beta 1 molecule was constructed by using the enzymes AvaI, HpaII, EcoRI, PvuII, Kpn1, BstEII, HpaI, HhaI, and HindIII. A comparison of this map to those of four independently isolated deletion derivatives of pAM beta 1 located the MLS resistance determinant within a 2-kb DNA segment and at least one conjugative function within an 8-kb region. The 5.0-kb EcoRI-B fragment from pAM beta 1 was ligated onto the 4.0-kb Escherichia coli plasmid vector, pACKC1, and used to transform E. coli HB101. The 9.0-kb chimeric plasmid was then used to transform Streptococcus sanguis Challis with concurrent expression of the E. coli kanamycin resistance determinant. The 5.0-kb EcoRI-B fragment from pAM beta 1 was subsequently used as a vector to clone a streptomycin resistance determinant from a strain of Streptococcus mutans containing no detectable plasmid DNA. Subcloning experiments, using a HindIII partial digest of pAM beta 1 DNA, narrowed the replication region of this plasmid to a 2.95-kb fragment.
TI  - Ability of various oral bacteria to bind human plasma fibronectin.
AB  - The present study describes the ability of various oral bacteria to bind human plasma fibronectin (PFN). Avid binding of 125I-PFN was found for Streptococcus mutans (serotypes a to h), Streptococcus sanguis, group A Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, while other gram-positive bacterial species tested demonstrated only weak or negligible PFN binding ability. Two gram-negative bacterial species, Bacteroides gingivalis and Escherichia coli, did not significantly bind PFN. 125I-PFN binding to S. mutans 6715 cells was decreased by pretreatment with unlabeled PFN, and the radiolabeled PFN bound to the cell surface was released on addition of unlabeled PFN. Strong inhibition of 125I-PFN binding to S. mutans 6715 cells was obtained by protease pretreatment, while partial inhibition was also observed following treatment with acid, alkali, lipase, and monoclonal anti-polyglycerophosphate. These results suggest that PFN binding to S. mutans cells is reversible and that PFN receptors on the cell surface appear to be heat-stable multiple proteins.
TI  - Non-protein-bound iron within bacterial cells and the action of bleomycin.
AB  - Damage to DNA by bleomycin in vitro is entirely dependent on the presence of an iron salt and molecular oxygen. This same reaction has been used to measure non-protein-bound iron in different bacterial species. Although several of the species examined were insensitive to the toxic effects of bleomycin, they all contained a concentration of non-protein-bound iron which should have been sufficient to allow iron-dependent damage to DNA. Other factors such as permeability or inactivation of the drug must explain their apparent insensitivity.
TI  - Novel shuttle plasmid vehicles for Escherichia-Streptococcus transgeneric cloning.
AB  - A novel plasmid vector that is able to replicate both in Escherichia coli and in  Streptococcus sanguis is described. This 9.2-kb plasmid, designated pVA856, carries Cmr, Tcr, and Emr determinants that are expressed in E. coli. Only the Emr determinant is expressed in S. sanguis. Both the Cmr and the Tcr of pVA856 may be insertionally inactivated. This plasmid affords several different cleavage-ligation strategies for cloning in E. coli followed by subsequent introduction of chimeras into S. sanguis. In addition, we have modified a previously described E. coli-S. sanguis shuttle plasmid [pVA838; Macrina et al., Gene 19 (1982) 345-353], so that it is unable to replicate in S. sanguis. The utility of such a plasmid for cloning and selecting sequences enabling autonomous replication in S. sanguis is demonstrated.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - The growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. fecalis, S. sanguis, S. bovis, S. mitior, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli, A-D group, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Pasteurella multocida or Listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. Two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. The analysis detected the growth of S. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and species of Micrococcus, Corynebacterium or Bacillus in 18 blood cultures.
TI  - A cloning vector able to replicate in Escherichia coli and Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - A plasmid that is able to replicate in both Escherichia coli and Streptococcus sanguis has been constructed by the in vitro joining of the pACYC184 (Cmr Tcr) and pVA749 (Emr) replicons. This plasmid, designated pVA838, is 9.2 kb in size and expresses Emr in both E. coli and S. sanguis. Its Cmr marker is expressed only in E. coli and may be inactivated by addition of DNA inserts at its internal EcoRI or PvuII sites. The pVA838 molecule also contains unique SalI, SphI, BamHI, NruI and XbaI cleavage sites suitable for molecular cloning. pVA838 may be amplified in E. coli but not in S. sanguis. We have used the pVA838 plasmid as a shuttle vector to clone streptococcal plasmid fragments in E. coli. Such chimeras isolated from E. coli were readily introduced into S. sanguis by transformation.
TI  - Humoral immune response to oral microorganisms in periodontitis.
AB  - Serum antibody titers from patients with periodontitis were compared with those from periodontally healthy subjects. With the micro-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, and IgM antibody titers to isolates of Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius, Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius, Bacteroides ochraceus, and Fusobacterium nucleation were determined. Antibody titers of the IgG and IgA classes to B. melaninogenicus, B. ochraceus, F. nucleatum, and S. sanguis were found to be significantly higher in the controls than in the patients. No correlations were found with serum IgM titers. These findings indicate that periodonitis may be associated with depressed antibacterial serum antibody titers of the IgG and IgA classes.
TI  - Purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - An inhibition factor from Streptococcus mutans strain C3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. Bacteriocin C3603 is a basic protein with a pI value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. The activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by pH over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees C for 10 min at pH 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees C for 15 min at pH 4.0. Pronase; papain, phospholipase C, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. Bacteriocin activity was greater against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and f than against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. Bacteriocin C3603 was also effective against selected strains of S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. bovis, S. faecium, S. lactis, Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, Propionibacterium acnes, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Corynebacterium parvum, and Candida albicans. The inhibition of S. mutans strains BHT and PS-14 by bacteriocin C3603 was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. When water or a diet containing bacteriocin C3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with S. mutans PS-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
TI  - Lactoperoxidase and thiocyanate protect bacteria from hydrogen peroxide.
AB  - Lactoperoxidase and thiocyanate were shown to protect Escherichia coli and three  oral streptococcal species from the bactericidal effect of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic conditions. Lactoperoxidase in the absence of thiocyanate was also protective for two of the bacterial species in a dilution medium but potentiated hydrogen peroxide toxicity for the other two under the same conditions. The products of the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and thiocyanate in the presence of lactoperoxidase were not bactericidal except in the case of E. coli, and then only under special conditions. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of lactoperoxidase and thiocyanate in protecting living cells from hydrogen peroxide toxicity. Although the effect on human cells was not examined in this study, extrapolation of these results to the cells of the oral mucosa would suggest an important protective role of lactoperoxidase and thiocyanate against the toxic effects of hydrogen peroxide in the oral cavity.
TI  - Construction of plasmid vectors for gene cloning in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - The construction and some properties of new hybrid plasmids which are able to replicate in both Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis are presented. A 5.5 Md hybrid plasmid pJP9 was constructed from pBR322 (Tc, Ap) and pUB110 (Nm) plasmids. pIM1 (7.0 Md) and pIM3 (7.7 Md) plasmids are its different erythromycin resistant derivatives. Tetracycline, ampicillin, neomycin and possibly erythromycin resistance genes are expressed in E. coli while neomycin and erythromycin resistance genes are expressed in B. subtilis. Insertional inactivation of only one gene is possible using the pJP9 plasmid as a vector in B. subtilis. However, insertional inactivation of at least two different genes can be achieved and monitored in E. coli and B. subtilis transformants in cloning experiments with PIM1 and pIM3 plasmids. Insertional inactivation of antibiotic resistance genes present in pJP9 plasmid was achieved by cloning of Streptococcus sanguis DNA fragments generated by appropriate restriction endonucleases. The pJP9 plasmid and its derivatives were found to be stable in both hosts cells.
TI  - New method that uses binding of immunoglobulin A to group A streptococcal immunoglobulin A Fc receptors for demonstration of microbial immunoglobulin A protease activity.
AB  - A new method is described for the detection of bacterial immunoglobulin A (IgA) protease which splits IgA into Fab and Fc fragments. The method takes advantage of a recent finding that receptors for IgA fragments occur commonly among type 4 group A streptococci. The bacterial preparation to be tested for protease activity was first incubated with radiolabeled purified IgA1 myeloma protein, and the proportion of radioactivity bound to a standard suspension of the streptococci was then measured. Since isolated Fab fragments do not bind to streptococcal IgA receptors, a decrease in the amount of radioactivity bound to the streptococci, as compared with the amount before digestion, indicates the presence of protease in the test preparation. Using this method, protease activity was detected in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus sanguis, but not in Escherichia coli or Branhamella catarrhalis.
TI  - Bacterial adherence: adhesin-receptor interactions mediating the attachment of bacteria to mucosal surface.
AB  - Recent studies have indicated that the attachment of bacteria to mucosal surfaces is the initial event in the pathogenesis of most infectious diseases due to bacteria in animals and humans. An understanding of the mechanisms of attachment and a definition of the adhesive molecules on the surfaces of bacteria (adhesins) as well as those on host cell membranes (receptors) have suggested new approaches to the prevention of serious bacterial infections: (1) application of purified adhesion or receptor materials or their analogues as competitive inhibitors of bacterial adherence; (2) administration of sublethal concentrations of antibiotics that suppress the formation and expression of bacterial adhesins; and (3) development of vaccines against bacterial surface components involved in adhesion to mucosal surfaces. Progress has already been made in the development of antiadhesive vaccines directed against the fimbrial adhesins of several human bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Effect of human saliva on glucose uptake by Streptococcus mutans and other oral microorganisms.
AB  - We examined the effects of human whole salivary supernatant and parotid fluid on  glucose uptake by Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. The following three effects of saliva were observed: (i) inhibition of glucose uptake (S. mutans, S. sanguis), (ii) promotion of a transient, rapid (0 to 30 s) burst of glucose uptake (S. mutans, S. sanguis), and (iii) enhancement of glucose uptake (S. mitis, A. viscosus, S. aureus, E. coli). We observed no differences between the effects of whole salivary supernatant and the effects of parotid fluid. Heat treatment (80 degrees C, 10 min) of saliva or the addition of dithiothreitol abolished inhibition of glucose uptake. Supplementation of saliva with H(2)O(2) potentiated inhibition of glucose uptake. S. mitis and A. viscosus, which were stimulated by saliva alone, were inhibited by H(2)O(2)-supplemented saliva; 50% inhibition of glucose uptake by S. mutans and S. mitis required ca. 10 muM H(2)O(2) in 50% (vol/vol) saliva. Loss of the inhibitory action of saliva occurred at about 5% (vol/vol) saliva. Supplementation of saliva dilutions with SCN(-) and H(2)O(2) extended the inhibitory activity to solutions containing ca. 0.2% (vol/vol) saliva. We suggest that the salivary lactoperoxidase-SCN(-)-H(2)O(2) system is responsible for the inhibitory activity of saliva reported here. Furthermore, we concluded that lactoperoxidase and SCN(-) are present in saliva specimens in concentrations that exceed minimal inhibitory levels by factors of ca. 500 and 10 to 20, respectively. The resistance of A. viscosus, S. aureus, and E. coli to the inhibitory potential of saliva alone was probably due to the production of catalase by these organisms. The resistance of S. mitis may have been due to special effects of saliva on H(2)O(2) accumulation by this organism compared with S. mutans and S. sanguis. The basis of saliva-dependent enhancement of glucose uptake and the basis of promotion of a transient, rapid burst of glucose uptake are unknown. The role of the salivary lactoperoxidase-SCN(-)-H(2)O(2) system in the oral microbial ecosystem is discussed.
TI  - Expression of streptococcal plasmid-determined resistance to erythromycin and lincomycin in Escherichia coli.
AB  
TI  - Molecular cloning in streptococci: physical mapping of the vehicle plasmid pSM10  and demonstration of intergroup DNA transfer.
AB  - The streptococcal resistance plasmid pSM10 (8.3 kb), a deletion derivative of pSM10419 (22.9 kb) determining constitutive erythromycin and lincomycin resistance, was physically mapped with the restriction endonucleases AvaI, AvaII, EcoRI, HpaI, KpnI, PvuII (one site each), HindIII, HaeII (three sites each), HincII (four sites), and HhaI (five sites). Using the cryptic plasmid pVA318 as cloning vehicle, the largest HindIII fragment of pSM10 (3.3 kb) was shown to contain the erythromycin/lincomycin resistance gene(s) of the plasmid. The AvaII site of pSM10 proved to be suitable as a site for cloning AvaII-generated chromosomal DNA fragments from a group C streptococcal strain in the Challis strain of Streptococcus sanguis (group) H). A detailed physical map of the chimeric plasmid pSM10221 (12.8 kb), a fusion product of pSM10 and the staphylococcal chloramphenicol resistance plasmid pC221 (4.5 kb), is also presented. The plasmid chimera has properties making it potentially useful in development of a doubly selective streptococcal cloning vehicle by searching for insertional inactivation.
TI  - Effect of temperature on the bactericidal action of sodium hypochlorite endodontic irrigant.
AB  - When the in vitro bactericidal action of 2.6 percent sodium hypochlorite endodontic irrigating solution was compared at room temperature (22 degrees C.) and at body temperature (37 degrees C.), sterility was achieved in significantly less time at 37 degrees C.
TI  - Interactions of competent Streptococcus sanguis (Wicky) cells with native or denatured, homologous or heterologous deoxyribonucleic acids.
AB  - Competent cell-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) interactions were examined using tritium-labeled homologous or heterologous native or denatured DNAs and competent Streptococcus sanguis Wicky cells (strain WE4). The DNAs used were extracted from WE4 cells, Escherichia coli B cells, and E. coli bacteriophages T2, T4, T6, and T7. The reactions examined were: (i) total DNA binding, (ii) deoxyribonuclease-resistant DNA binding, and (iii) the production of acid-soluble products from the DNA. Optimal temperatures for the reactions were as follows: reaction (i), between 30 and 40 degrees C; reaction (ii), 30 degrees C; and reaction (iii), greater than 40 degrees C. The rates for the reactions (expressed as molecules of DNA that reacted per minute per colony-forming unit) did not vary greatly from one DNA source to another. With a constant competent cell concentration and differing DNA concentrations below a saturation level (from a given source), a different but constant fraction of the added DNA was cell bound, deoxyribonuclease resistant, and degraded to acid-soluble products. In experiments where the number of competent cells was varied and the DNA concentration was held constant, again essentially the same result was obtained. The extent of reactions (i), (ii), and (iii) depended upon the numbers as well as the source of DNA molecules applied to competent cells. Calcium ion essential for native DNA-cell reactions was also found essential for denatured DNA-cell reactions. Data obtained from competition experiments lead to the conclusion that competent WE4 cells contain specific sites for native as well as denatured DNAs.
TI  - Nucleic acid transport driven by ion gradient across cell membrane.
AB  
TI  - Binding of glucosyltransferase and glucan synthesis by Streptococcus mutans and other bacteria.
AB  - Lyophilized and heat-treated cells from the seven serotypes of Streptococcus mutans were examined for their ability to bind added insoluble-product glucosyl-transferase (GTase) and to synthesize cell-associated glucan from [(14)C]sucrose. Lyophilized cells of serotypes a and g did not synthesize any more additional glucan than did the controls after exposure to GTase. These cells, however, synthesized four- to eightfold-greater quantities of glucan than did the cells of the remaining serotypes. Lyophilized cells of serotypes b, c, d, e, and f synthesized two- to threefold-greater quantities of glucan after exposure to GTase than did the controls without added enzyme. Lyophilized cells of serotypes a and g synthesized 6- to 10-fold-greater quantities of glucan than did heat-treated cells of the same strain after binding of GTase. Lyophilized cells of the remaining serotypes synthesized only 1.6- to 3.3-fold-greater quantities of glucan than did the heat-treated cells. These results demonstrate that heat treatment to inactivate cell-associated GTase does not create additional GTase binding sites in S. mutans and that serotypes a and g are considerably more active in cell-associated glucan synthesis than cells of the other five serotypes. Ten species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria from five genera which do not produce in vitro plaque synthesized 10- to 100-fold-less glucan than did the S. mutans strains after exposure to GTase. Of these species, S. sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, and A. naeslundii synthesized the largest quantities of glucan. Three mutant strains of S. mutans which possess a reduced ability for in vitro adherence but do agglutinate with glucan or dextran synthesized only one-third as much glucan after binding of GTase as the control. These results are discussed in relation to in vitro and in vivo plaque development and the agglutination of S. mutans. The results support earlier findings which indicate that the presence of bacterial species other than S. mutans in smooth-surface dental plaque is due in part to contact of the cells with glucan in the developing plaque and not to the binding of cell-free GTase and the in situ synthesis of glucan. The results obtained with these representative strains of the seven serotypes of S. mutans may not apply to the same extent to other strains within the serotypes.
TI  - Use of extractable adenosine triphosphate to estimate the viable cell mass in dental plaque samples obtained from monkeys.
AB  - The viable cell mass in plaque samples obtained from monkeys was estimated by determining the concentration of extractable adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and total cell mass was estimated by measuring the protein content. The results were expressed in terms of the specific ATP and protein contents of Streptococcus sanguis. The viable counts estimated by these techniques were comparable to or exceeded viable counts obtained by other investigators using conventional bacteriological methods.
TI  - A leucocyte migration study on the cell-mediated immunity against adult human oral mucosa and streptococcal antigens in patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis.
AB  - In vitro demonstration of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) against adult human oral mucosa antigen (AHOM) and streptococcal antigens was accomplished by means of the leucocyte migration test (LMT) in patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS). If antigenic extracts of AHOM, Streptococcus sanguis strain 2A or Streptococcus pyogenes strain M5 were used in the LMT experiments, the distribution of migration indices (MI) over patients with RAS differed significantly from the distribution over the controls. In patients with other oral lesions, these MI-distributions did not differ significantly from those among the controls. Extracts of other tissues such as kidney and uterus tissues or of other bacterial antigens such as Brucella abortus and Escherichia coli did not reveal any significant differences between the LMT responses in RAS and controls. The present findings show that CIM against AHOM antigen and streptococcal antigens are features characteristic of RAS. Furthermore, the results indicate that common antigenic determinants might be shared by AHOM and streptococci.
TI  - Recovery and clearance rates of oral microorganisms following experimental bacteraemias in dogs.
AB  
TI  - Chemical composition of the washed cells of Streptococcus sanguis (804) and Streptococcus mutans (B-14).
AB  - Washed cells of Streptococcus saguis (804) and Streptococcus mutans (B14) were analyzed for water, ash, protein, carbohydrate, lipid, and nucleic acid content. Lipids were analyzed by gas chromatography. Ash was subjected to elemental analysis. These data were compared with the published values for the composition of dental plaque.
TI  - Effect of polymyxin B on liposomal membranes derived from Escherichia coli lipids.
AB  - The specificity of the action of polymyxin B was studied using liposomes as a model membrane system. Liposomes prepared from total lipids of Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, a mixture of purified E. coli phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin and a mixture of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol, were extemely sensitive to polymyxin while those prepared from lipids of Gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus sanguis, lipids of sheep erythrocyte membranes, mixtures of egg lecithin and negatively charged amphiphatic molecules, were less sensitive to the action of the antibiotic. Cholesterol was shown to suppress the polymyxin-induced response in liposomes.
