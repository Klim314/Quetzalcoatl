TI  == in vitro screening of lactobacilli isolated from chicken excreta to control salmonella enteritidis and typhimurium.
AB  == 1. the aim of this work was to select lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains from chicks and hens of egg-laying strains for potential use to control salmonellae. 2. nineteen lab strains obtained from culture collections, and 24 strains isolated from excreta of laying hens and chicks, were evaluated for inhibitory capacities against two salmonella serotypes using a "spot-the-lawn" technique and other in vitro properties that could be predictive of antimicrobial activity. 3.  the size of the inhibition zone differed slightly between salmonella serotypes, however, the mean size of the salmonella inhibition zone differed greatly among the lab strains. lactobacillus salivarius, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. reuteri exhibited powerful inhibitory effects to each salmonella strain. 4. the result of the acid tolerance test showed that all l. salivarius, l. kitasatonis strains and each of l. ingluviei cannot survive in a low ph environment. in the bile acid tolerance assay, growth was inhibited in all strains, except l. kitasatonis he4, and a large inhibition was observed in most of the l. salivarius and l. crispatus strains. 5. the results demonstrate that some lab of poultry origin were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella and survive simulated passage through the gastrointestinal tract. the selected lab could act in the lower gastrointestinal tract to prevent salmonellosis in poultry.

TI  == bile stimulates cell surface hydrophobicity, congo red binding and biofilm formation of lactobacillus strains.
AB  == seventeen lactobacillus strains were tested for cell surface hydrophobicity (csh) using the salt aggregation test (sat) and congo red binding (crb) assay. crb was  dependent on ph and ionic strength and was protease-sensitive. in the presence of 100 mug ml(-1) cholesterol, the crb was significantly reduced. autoaggregating (aa) lactobacillus crispatus strains showed 50% more crb than the reference strain, the curli-producing escherichia coli mc4 100. crb of l. crispatus 12005,  l. paracasei f8, l. plantarum f44 and l. paracasei f19 were enhanced when grown in man rogosa sharpe (mrs) broth with 0.5% taurocholic acid (ta) or 5% porcine bile (pb) (p < 0.05). csh was also enhanced for the non-aa strains l. plantarum f44, l. paracasei f19 and l. rhamnosus gg when grown in mrs broth with 0.5% ta, 5% pb or 0.25% mucin, with enhanced biofilm formation in mrs broth with bile (p < 0.05). two aa strains, l. crispatus 12005 and l. paracasei f8, developed biofilm  independent of bile or mucin. in summary, under bile-stressed growth conditions,  early (24-h cultures) biofilm formation is associated with an increase in hydrophobic cell surface proteins and high crb. late mature (72-h culture) biofilm contained more carbohydrates, as shown by crystal violet staining.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == macrolide resistance and in vitro selection of resistance to antibiotics in lactobacillus isolates.
AB  == spreading of resistance to antibiotics is of great concern due to the increasing  rate of isolation of multiresistant pathogens. since commensal bacteria may transfer determinants of resistance to pathogens, studies on development of resistance should include also lactobacilli. resistance to macrolides, penicillins and tetracycline was determined in 40 isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus crispatus, and lactobacillus  casei isolated from faeces of apparently healthy volunteers. frequency of mutation and changes in susceptibility after serial exposure to these antibiotics at concentrations of 4x and 8x mic were evaluated in susceptible isolates. acquired resistance was defined as an increment in mic values of at least four times in respect to the pre-selection values. resistance to macrolides and/or tetracycline was identified in 14 and 4 isolates, respectively. ermb gene and a2058g mutation in 23s rrna were detected in macrolide resistant isolates. frequencies of mutation of susceptible isolates (n=26) were lower for ampicillin  and erythromycin than for tetracycline. serial exposure to antibiotics led to selection of resistant mutants. however, acquired resistance was rather unstable  and was lost after subcultures in antibiotic-free medium in most mutants. resistance to erythromycin was associated to a a2058g mutation in 23s rrna. in conclusion, results indicate that resistance to macrolides and tetracycline is present among intestinal lactobacilli. decrease in susceptibility following serial exposure to antibiotics might occur in lactobacilli, in a strain- and antibiotic-dependent way. since lactobacilli are often used as probiotics, their  ability to acquire resistance should be evaluated for isolates candidate to be included in probiotics based products.

TI  == characterization of indigenous vaginal lactobacilli from healthy women as probiotic candidates.
AB  == the probiotic relevant characteristics of 45 strains of vaginal lactobacillus isolated from healthy women were analyzed. of these, 21 strains were classified as l. crispatus, 17 as l. jensenii, six as l. gasseri, and one as l. plantarum. the rate of acidification varied significantly between the strains as did their ability to form biofilms. none used glycogen as a fermentable carbohydrate. h2o2  generation was common, especially among l. jensenii isolates (88%). no bacteriocinogenic strains were detected. most strains harbored plasmids (from 1 to 7) of various sizes, those in excess of 50 kb being frequent. one of these plasmids was found to be promiscuous since it hybridized with extrachromosomal bands of 15 isolates. all strains were resistant to metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, clindamycin, trimethoprim, and sulfametoxazole and susceptible to a series of beta-lactams, erythromycin, tetracycline, and benzalkonium chloride. almost half of the strains were highly resistant to nonoxinol 9, which is commonly used as a spermicide. based on these analyses, strains of all three common species are proposed as new probiotic candidates.

TI  == blueberry husks and multi-strain probiotics affect colonic fermentation in rats.
AB  == the aim was to investigate how blueberry husks and/or mixtures of probiotic strains (lactobacillus crispatus dsm16743, l. gasseri dsm16737 and l. plantarum dsm15313 (labmix), or bifidobacterium infantis dsm15159 and dsm15161 (bifmix)) affect colonic fermentation, caecal counts of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and enterobacteriaceae, body weight gain, and blood concentrations of carboxylic acids (ca) and ammonia in rats. dietary fibres in blueberry husks were fermented  to 61 % in colon, and the elevated faecal excretion of fibre and protein contributed to the high faecal bulking capacity (1.3). the caecal pool of ca was  higher in rats fed blueberry husks than the fibre-free control (p < 0.05), and the propionic acid proportion was higher in the distal colon than in the control  group (p < 0.05). probiotics lowered the caecal amount of ca when added to blueberry husks (p < 0.001), while the propionic acid proportion was higher with  labmix (p < 0.01) than blueberry husks only. the propionic acid and butyric acid  concentrations in blood were higher in rats fed blueberry husks and probiotics than those fed blueberry husks only (p < 0.01), implying that the absorption of these acids was facilitated by the bacteria. the caecal counts of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and enterobacteriaceae were lower in rats fed blueberry husks than the control diet (p < 0.05). the body weight gain was partly influenced by the caecal tissue and contents weights, and bifmix decreased the ammonia concentration in blood (p < 0.05). we conclude that colonic fermentation is differentially affected by dietary fibre and probiotics, which may be of importance when developing foods with certain health effects.

TI  == diversity and dynamics of lactobacilli populations during ripening of rdo camembert cheese.
AB  == the diversity and dynamics of lactobacillus populations in traditional raw milk camembert cheese were monitored throughout the manufacturing process in 3 dairies. culture-dependent analysis was carried out on isolates grown on acidified de man - rogosa - sharpe agar and lactobacillus anaerobic de man rogosa sharpe agar supplemented with vancomycin and bromocresol green media. the isolates were identified by polymerase chain reaction - temperature gradient gel  electrophoresis (pcr-tgge) and (or) species-specific pcr and (or) sequencing, and lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus plantarum isolates were characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). milk and cheese were subjected to culture-independent analysis by pcr-tgge. presumed lactobacilli were detected by  plate counts throughout the ripening process. however, molecular analysis of total dna and dna of isolates failed to detect lactobacillus spp. in certain cases. the dominant species in the 3 dairies was l. paracasei. pfge analysis revealed 21 different profiles among 39 l. paracasei isolates. lactobacillus plantarum was the second most isolated species, but it occurred nearly exclusively in one dairy. the other species isolated were lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, a lactobacillus psittaci/delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus/gallinarum/crispatus group, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus kefiri, and lactobacillus perolens. lactobacilli diversity  at the strain level was high. dynamics varied among dairies, and each cheese exhibited a specific picture of species and strains.

TI  == isolation and molecular characterization of antibiotic-resistant lactic acid bacteria from poultry and swine meat products.
AB  == the transfer via the food chain from animals to humans of microbes that are resistant to antimicrobial agents is of increasing concern. to determine the contributions of nonpathogenic microflora to the occurrence and spread of antibiotic resistance (ar) genes in the food chain, 123 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from 29 samples of raw and processed pork and chicken meat products that had previously tested positive for one or more ar genes that encode clinically relevant ars: tet(m), tet(o), tet(k), erm(a), erm(b), erm(c), aac (6')-ie aph (2")-ia, meca, and blaz. all of the isolates were initially tested for their ar gene profiles by pcr. the 59 isolates carrying a tet, erm, or blaz gene were taken through molecular identification, analyzed by determination of the mic, and subjected to genetic fingerprinting. lactococcus garvieae was the predominant species (28 isolates), followed by lactobacillus plantarum (11 isolates) and l. salivarius (6 isolates), whereas lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus  johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. crispatus, and l. brevis were identified at lower frequencies. the tet(m) and erm(b) genes were the most frequently detected. assessment of multiple resistances in 18 tet positive (tet+) isolates revealed that tet(m) plus erm(b) and tet(k) plus erm(b) were the most frequent ar gene patterns. partial sequencing of the tet(m) open reading frame of three selected strains showed high sequence similarities (> 99%) with tet(m) genes previously found in human pathogens (listeria monocytogenes and neisseria meningitidis). southern hybridization with plasmid profiles revealed these strains contained tet(m)-carrying plasmids.

TI  == molecular identification of vaginal lactobacilli isolated from bulgarian women.
AB  == lactobacilli play an important role in maintaining the vaginal health of women. the development of suitable bacterial replacement therapies for the treatment of  vaginosis requires knowledge of the vaginal lactobacilli species representation.  the aim of this study was to identify at the species level vaginal lactobacillus  isolates obtained from bulgarian women in childbearing age by using different molecular methods. twenty-two strains of lactobacilli isolated from vaginal samples were identified and grouped according to their genetic relatedness. a combined approach, which included amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra), ribotyping and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with species-specific oligonucleotide primers was applied. all vaginal isolates were grouped into 5 clusters in comparison with a set of 21 reference strains based on the initial ardra results, which was then confirmed by ribotyping. finally, the strains were  subjected to pcr analysis with eight different species-specific primer pairs, which allowed most of them to be classified as belonging to one of the following  species: lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus helveticus and lactobacillus plantarum. in conclusion, this study suggests that the most straightforward identification strategy for vaginal lactobacilli would be grouping by ardra or ribotyping, followed by pcr specific primers identification at species level.

TI  == selection of potential probiotic lactobacilli from pig feces to be used as additives in pelleted feeding.
AB  == thirty-five isolates from pig feces were identified as lactobacillus reuteri (12  strains), lactobacillus mucosae (7), lactobacillus plantarum (6), lactobacillus kitasatonis (3), lactobacillus rossiae (2), lactobacillus ultunensis (2), lactobacillus crispatus (2), and lactobacillus intestinalis (1) by partial sequence analysis of the 16s rrna. all isolates were detected at 8-9 log cfu g(-1). preliminarily, strains were selected based on resistance to heat treatments (ca. 70 degrees c for 10 s). the decrease in viability for some l. reuteri, l. mucosae, l. plantarum, l. kitasatonis, and l. rossiae strains was lower than 1 log cycle. selected strains were further characterized for acid and  bile salt resistance, and antibacterial activity. except for l. kitasatonis, tolerance to simulated gastric and intestinal conditions was enhanced for all strains by addition of reconstituted skimmed milk. antibacterial activity was found against gram-positive and -negative potential pathogens. l. reuteri 8.1, 3s7, 6.2, and 1.2, l. mucosae 1.1r, l. plantarum 4.1, and l. rossiae 4.4 were freeze-dried and mixed (1%, w/w) into pig feed before pelleting. after pelleting, pig feed contained 10-9 log cfu kg(-1) of lactobacilli. l. plantarum 4.1, and l.  reuteri 3s7 were selected based on their bile salt resistance, ph tolerance, antimicrobial activity and heat resistance. the findings in this study provide a  strong basis for exploring the potential of porcine lactobacilli isolates to be used in pelleted feeding as probiotic additives.

TI  == use of polymerase chain reaction techniques and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for differentiation of oral lactobacillus species.
AB  == background/aims: the genus lactobacillus has been associated with dental caries in humans, although it is seldom speciated due to lack of simple and nonlaborious identification methods. a considerable heterogeneity among lactobacillus species  has been demonstrated. the purpose of this study was to develop simple methods combining restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-amplified 16s rrna (16s rrna gene pcr-rflp) and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) for the identification of 13 reference strains of lactobacillus. methods: the 16s rrna gene sequences were  amplified by pcr using universal primers and digestion of pcr products with the restriction endonucleases, hpaii and haeiii. the 16s rrna gene pcr-rflp is reproducible and has been proved to be useful for differentiating lactobacillus strains to species level. seventy-seven lactobacillus isolates from a thai population were used to show the applicability of the identification test. results: pcr-rflp alone had limitations, because the rflp patterns of lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus rhamnosus and of lactobacillus acidophilus  and lactobacillus crispatus showed similar patterns; however, these could be differentiated by sds-page. of the 77 isolates, 38 were identified as lactobacillus fermentum, 25 as l. rhamnosus, 5 as lactobacillus salivarius, 5 as  l. casei, 3 as l. acidophilus and 1 as lactobacillus plantarum. conclusion: 16s rrna gene pcr-rflp, using hpaii and haeiii, together with sds-page protein profiles could be an alternative method for the identification of oral lactobacillus strains to species level, and may be applicable for large-scale studies on the association of lactobacillus to dental caries.

TI  == lactobacillus vaginal microbiota of women attending a reproductive health care service in benin city, nigeria.
AB  == objective: the objective of this study was to determine whether lactobacillus species found in african women differ substantially to those of white decent, described in previous studies. the vaginal microbiota play an important role in female health, and when the naturally dominant lactobacilli are displaced resulting in bacterial vaginosis (bv), the host is more at risk of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases, including hiv. methods: vaginal samples were collected from 241 healthy, premenopausal nigerian women, which were then gram-stained for nugent scoring. microbial dna was extracted, amplified using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and lactobacillus primers, and processed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). lactobacillus species were identified by dna sequencing and blast algorithm. results: of the samples, 207 (85.8%) had pcr products for lactobacilli, whereas 34 (14.2%) showed absence of lactobacilli, which correlated to the bv nugent scores. on sequencing of amplicons, 149 subjects (72%) had sequence homologies to lactobacilli. most women (64%) were colonized by l. iners as the predominant strain, similar to previous findings in canadian and swedish women. l. gasseri was found in 7.3% samples, followed by l. plantarum, l. suntoryeus, l. crispatus, l. rhamnosus, and other species. conclusion: the findings indicate that even with geographic, racial, and other differences, the predominant vaginal lactobacillus species is similar to species in women from northern countries.

TI  == [inhibitory activity of vaginal lactobacillus bacteria on yeasts causing vulvovaginal candidiasis].
AB  == growing frequency of therapeutical failures of vulvovaginal candidiasis, resulting from resistance of certain species of candida to imidazole agents, raises interest in the use of probiotics from lactobacillus genera as prophylaxis. unfortunately, little is known about inhibitory mechanisms of lactobacillus on candida. the aim of this study was to compare the activity of selected lactobacillus species, representing the physiological vaginal flora, against candida as well as investigation whether their inhibitory activity against candida is related strictly to hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid production. 125 strains from vaginal smears of healthy women were classified by making use of phenotypic and genotypic methods. the majority of strains belonged  to l. acidophilus: l. acidophilus sensu stricto, l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l.  johnsonii as well as l. fermentum and l. plantarum species. culture supernatants  of selected 25 strains representing the isolated species were examined for their  inhibitory activity against the growth of candida albicans and c. glabrata. the results showed that the strongest and the fastest activity against c. albicans was demonstrated by l. delbrueckii strains, producing the largest quantities of hydrogen peroxide. on the other hand, extended activity, demonstrable after 24 hours, was shown by non-h2o2 producing l. plantarum supernatants. growth of c. glabrata was not inhibited by any of the examined strains of lactobacillus. comparison of activity of live active cultures of lactobacillus strains and their mixtures with this of pure h2o2 and lactic acid has shown that pure chemical compounds were less active than the cultures. this suggests that mixtures of lactobacillus strains are in cooperation with each other using many different metabolites.

TI  == susceptibility to some antifungal drugs of vaginal lactobacilli isolated from healthy women.
AB  == samples were taken from the lateral vaginal wall of 19 healthy women. lactobacilli were isolated from ten of these women. fifty-eight lactobacillus isolates were identified as l. gasseri, l. vaginalis, l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii spp. lactis, l. crispatus, l. plantarum, l. cellobiosus, l. jensenii, l. salivarius, l. curvatus, l. brevis and l. oris. the inhibitory effect of isoconazole and oxiconazole in 0.2, 0.1 and 0.05 microg/ml concentrations on 58 lactobacillus spp. and candida albicans (ajd 180) were investigated, using an agar diffusion method. although both antifungal drugs showed a large inhibitory effect on c. albicans, oxiconazole had a very low inhibitory effect on lactobacillus isolates. the natural resistance of lactobacilli to anti-fungal drugs may enable the development of an antifungal drug(s)/ probiotic combination  for antifungal activity and lactobacilli replacement therapy.

TI  == presence of drug resistance in intestinal lactobacilli of dairy and human origin  in turkey.
AB  == the prevalence of different resistance genes was investigated in lactobacilli of  human and dairy origin by pcr. the presence of erm, van, tet, and cat-tc genes were determined in 16 raw milk, 15 cream, 10 yogurt, 50 hand-made cheese, and 20  industrially produced white-cheese samples of dairy origin and 16 mouth, 32 fecal, and 36 vaginal samples from different subjects of human origin. lactobacilli of dairy and human origin were found to carry only erm(b) and tet(m) genes. the majority of the isolates, lactobacillus crispatus (61), lactobacillus  gasseri (49), lactobacillus plantarum (80) studied were found to harbor either erm(b) or tet(m) gene or both. no resistant lactobacilli was found in raw-milk and cream samples. all the human fecal samples and the majority of vaginal (29 of 36) and mouth (10 of 14) samples were found to carry the resistance genes. while  a third of the hand-made cheeses carried resistant lactobacilli only one industrially produced cheese was found to carry resistant lactobacilli. furthermore, the genes were found in the non-starter species, lactobacillus acidophilus and lb. plantarum, indicating that industrially produced cheeses in this respect could be considered more favorable. these results indicate that drug resistance seems to be very common in turkey. even though the number of dairy samples harboring the resistance genes (17 of 111) is smaller in regards to human samples, 10% of them were still found to carry the resistance genes as well. the  presence of the resistance genes in majority of the samples of human origin and in minority of the samples of dairy origin indicates that drug resistance may be  acquired in the intestinal tract during passage and spread to dairy products by the hands of workers during production.

TI  == susceptibility of lactobacillus spp. to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == bacteria used as probiotics or in starter cultures may serve as hosts of antibiotic resistance genes, which can be transferred to pathogenic bacteria. before launching a starter culture or a probiotic product into the market, it is  therefore important to verify that the single bacterial isolates (strains) do not contain transferable resistance genes. a study has been undertaken to establish the levels of susceptibility of lactobacillus spp. to various antimicrobial agents. this is a prerequisite for differentiating putative transferable resistance from natural resistance. a selection of 62 strains has been screened with the use of the etest (abbiodisk, stockholm, sweden) for their susceptibility to 25 antimicrobial agents. the strains belonged to the following species: lactobacillus plantarum/pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. paracasei, l. sakei, l. curvatus and species of the l. acidophilus group: l. johnsonii, l. crispatus, l.  gasseri, and l. acidophilus. the results from the etests have shown that the level of susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents is species-dependent. for the following antimicrobial agents, susceptibility varied several folds between species: vancomycin, teicoplanin, tetracycline, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fusidic acid, and clindamycin. the differences between the species were more subtle for the rest of the tested antimicrobial agents. on the basis of the result, it was possible to suggest minimal inhibition concentrations (mics) for the individual lactobacillus species to be used as a microbiological breakpoint when screening strains for transferable resistance genes.

TI  == decarboxylation of substituted cinnamic acids by lactic acid bacteria isolated during malt whisky fermentation.
AB  == seven strains of lactobacillus isolated from malt whisky fermentations and representing lactobacillus brevis, l. crispatus, l. fermentum, l. hilgardii, l. paracasei, l. pentosus, and l. plantarum contained genes for hydroxycinnamic acid (p-coumaric acid) decarboxylase. with the exception of l. hilgardii, these bacteria decarboxylated p-coumaric acid and/or ferulic acid, with the production  of 4-vinylphenol and/or 4-vinylguaiacol, respectively, although the relative activities on the two substrates varied between strains. the addition of p-coumaric acid or ferulic acid to cultures of l. pentosus in mrs broth induced hydroxycinnamic acid decarboxylase mrna within 5 min, and the gene was also induced by the indigenous components of malt wort. in a simulated distillery fermentation, a mixed culture of l. crispatus and l. pentosus in the presence of  saccharomyces cerevisiae decarboxylated added p-coumaric acid more rapidly than the yeast alone but had little activity on added ferulic acid. moreover, we were  able to demonstrate the induction of hydroxycinnamic acid decarboxylase mrna under these conditions. however, in fermentations with no additional hydroxycinnamic acid, the bacteria lowered the final concentration of 4-vinylphenol in the fermented wort compared to the level seen in a pure-yeast fermentation. it seems likely that the combined activities of bacteria and yeast  decarboxylate p-coumaric acid and then reduce 4-vinylphenol to 4-ethylphenol more effectively than either microorganism alone in pure cultures. although we have shown that lactobacilli participate in the metabolism of phenolic compounds during malt whisky fermentations, the net result is a reduction in the concentrations of 4-vinylphenol and 4-vinylguaiacol prior to distillation.

TI  == rapid identification of 11 human intestinal lactobacillus species by multiplex pcr assays using group- and species-specific primers derived from the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna.
AB  == rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays were established to identify human intestinal lactobacilli; a multiplex pcr was used for grouping of lactobacilli with a mixture of group-specific primers followed by four multiplex pcr assays with four sorts of species-specific primer mixtures for identification at the species level. primers used were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna  gene of members of the genus lactobacillus which are commonly isolated from human stool specimens: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus delbrueckii (ssp. bulgaricus and ssp. lactis), lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus paracasei (ssp. paracasei and ssp. tolerans), lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus salivarius (ssp. salicinius and ssp. salivarius). the established two-step multiplex pcr assays were applied  to the identification of 84 lactobacillus strains isolated from human stool specimens and the pcr results were consistent with the results from the dna-dna hybridization assay. these results suggest that the multiplex pcr system established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of common lactobacillus isolates from human stool samples.

AB  == the efficacy of a biochemical kit, api50chl kit, for identification of intestinal and vaginal lactobacilli from humans was evaluated by comparing with the results  of dna-dna hybridization assay. the results showed that in total only 52 of the 172 strains (30.2%) tested were identified correctly by the kit at species level. especially all strains of some species, such as lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus crispatus, were misidentified as lactobacillus acidophilus by the kit. however, the kit was found to be reliable for identification of lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. this suggests that the exact identification of lactobacillus isolates from human stool and vaginal specimens by api50chl kit is  difficult without the support of modern genotypic technique.

AB  == two-hundred and fifty lactobacillus strains isolated from healthy and diseased mucosa of human intestines of 75 individuals and 49 reference strains were phenotypically classified using 49 unit characters. data were processed by the jaccard (sj) and simple matching (ssm) coefficients, and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. seventeen major clusters were defined at the  76% sj-similarity level which approximately correspond to the ssm-level of 91%. seven clusters could be identified: lactobacillus plantarum (isolates recovered from 5% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. rhamnosus (17% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (5% of the patients), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (3% of the patients), lact. buchneri (4% of patients), lact. reuteri (4% of the patients) and lact. salivarius subsp. salivarius (9% of the patients). unassigned clusters 1 and 3 both contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains. cluster 1 included the type strains of lact. crispatus, lact. acidophilus, lact. jensenii and lact. gasseri, and cluster 3, the type strains of lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lact. agilis and lact. casei subsp. tolerans. clusters 1 and 3 were found in 15% and 25% of the patients, respectively. unassigned clusters 2, 6, 7, 8 and 10 contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. clusters 11, 12, 15 and 17 were made up of heterofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. phenotypical characteristics of the clusters are given. no obvious trends in species (cluster) composition between different intestinal locations could be noted. most clusters contained isolates from both diseased and healthy mucosa. exceptions were cluster 15 and cluster 17 which only included isolates from healthy mucosa, and cluster 11 which only included isolates from diseased mucosa. cluster 15 was isolated in 12% of the patients, and cluster 11 in 8%.
