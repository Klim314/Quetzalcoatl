TI  - Oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  - Two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. Of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (Peptostreptococcus (1); Eubacterium (9); Clostridium (6); Veillonella (6); Megasphera (1); Bacteroides (28); Fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (P. anaerobius (1); E. fossor (9); C. villosum (1); B. fragilis (1); B. tectum (2); B. heparinolyticus (2)). Three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (LRT) or paraoral (PO) bacterial infections. Of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. Phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. Among the obligately anaerobic species, Gram-positive cocci including P. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, E. fossor 11% and other Gram-positive rods (excluding Clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. The Gram-negative rods comprised B. fragilis 5%, B. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented Bacteroides 3% and other Bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of Fusobacterium (7%), and Gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. Among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by Pasteurella spp. 19%, Escherichia coli 17%, Actinomyces spp. 9%, Streptococcus spp. 9%. Incidental facultative isolates were Enterococcus spp. 2%, Enterobacter cloaceae 2%, Actinobacillus spp. 2% and Gram-negative corroding rods 5%. On the basis of the similarities (as determined by DNA hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. E. fossor and B. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and LRT and PO diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.
TI  - Susceptibility to erythromycin of anaerobes of the genera Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Sphaerophorus, Veillonella, Clostridium, Corynebacterium, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of erythromycin were determined by broth dilution tests for 313 anaerobic strains, most of which were clinical isolates. All the gram-positive anaerobes tested (84 Peptococcaceae, including 21 Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and 15 Peptococcus variabilis; 65 Corynebacterium acnes and 29 Clostridium strains, including 13 C. perfringens) were sensitive (MIC values 0.012 through 3.12 microgram erythromycin/ml); so were 111 cultures of gram-negative anaerobes (52 Bacteroides fragilis, 12 B. thetaiotaomicron, 7 B. vulgatus, 13 B. oralis, 4 B. melaninogenicus, 10 Sphaerophorus necrophorus, 2 Veillonella sp., 11 members of other species). Erythromycin at concentrations of 6.25 through 200.0 microgram/ml was active against 24 strains (1 B. fragilis, 4 Fusobacterium fusiforme, 9 Sph. freundi, 10 Sph. varius). The present results are compared to the limited number of reports existing with regard to the susceptibility of anaerobes to erythromycin.
TI  - [Antibacterial and bactericidal activity of tinidazole against anaerobic bacteria comparing with metronidazole (author's transl)].
AB  - Antibacterial activity of tinidazole (1-2-(ethylsulfonyl)-2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole) against anaerobic bacteria including Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium, Propionibacterium, Bacteroides and Fusobacterium was studied by agar dilution method comparing with metronidazole. In addition to this work, bactericidal effect of tinidazole and metronidazole against P. prevotii, B. fragilis ss. fragilis and F. varium was examined by quantitative culture method after incubation in GAM broth containing of 4 MIC, 2 MIC, 1 MIC and 1/2 MIC of both drugs against each of three strains for 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours. All the strains of Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus including P. anaerobius, P. saccharolyticus, P. prevotii and Ps. anaerobius and others were susceptible to a concentration of 6.25 mcg/ml of this drug. A concentration of 3.13 mcg/ml inhibited all strains of Bacteroides including B. fragilis ss. fragilis (12 strains), ss. vulgatus (5 strains), ss. thetaiotaomicron (4 strains) and ss. distasonis (2 strains). To this concentration all strains of Fusobacterium including F. varium (20 strains), F. mortiferum (2 strains) and other Fusobacterium sp. (5 strains) were susceptible. On the contrary, Propionibacterium acnes (6 strains) was resistant to 100 mcg/ml or more of tinidazole and metronidazole. The antibacterial activity of tinidazole was stronger against Bacteroides than that of metronidazole, while almost equal against Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium and Fusobacterium. Tinidazole was bactericidal against F. varium in a concentration of 2 MIC till 24 hours of incubation but did not show such an activity on B. fragilis ss. fragilis in same concentration even after 12 hours of incubation. On the other hand, metronidazole was bactericidal against B. fragilis ss. fragilis while was not against F. varium. Against P. prevotii bactericidal activity of both drugs was similar. Tinidazole as well as metronidazole is an excellent chemotherapeutic agent against anaerobic bacteria excluding Propionibacterium acnes and Bifidobacterium adolescentis.
