TI  == microbiological quality of indoor air in university libraries.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the concentration of bacteria and fungi in the indoor environment of jimma university libraries, so as to estimate the health hazard and to create standards for indoor air quality control. methods: the microbial quality of indoor air of eight libraries of jimma university was determined. the  settle plate method using open petri-dishes containing different culture media was employed to collect sample twice daily. isolates were identified according to standard methods. results: the concentrations of bacteria and fungi aerosols in the indoor environment of the university libraries ranged between 367-2595 cfu/m(3). according to the sanitary standards classification of european commission, almost all the libraries indoor air of jimma university was heavily contaminated with bacteria and fungi. in spite of their major source difference,  the average fungi density found in the indoor air of libraries did appear to follow the same trend with bacterial density (p=0.001). the bacteria isolates included micrococcus sp., staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus sp. and neisseria sp. while cladosporium sp., alternaria sp., penicillium sp. and aspergillus sp. were the most isolated fungi. conclusions: the indoor air of all  libraries were in the range above highly contaminated according to european commission classification and the most isolates are considered as potential candidates involved in the establishment of sick building syndromes and often associated with clinical manifestations like allergy, rhinitis, asthma and conjunctivitis. thus, attention must be given to control those environmental factors which favor the growth and multiplication of microbes in indoor environment of libraries to safeguard the health of users and workers.

TI  == microbiological assessment of indoor air of a teaching hospital in nigeria.
AB  == objective: to investigate the quality of indoor air of different wards and units  of olabisi onabanjo university teaching hospital, sagamu, to ascertain their contribution to infection rate in the hospital. methods: the microbial quality of indoor air of nine wards/units of olabisi onabanjo university teaching hospital,  sagamu, nigeria was conducted. sedimentation technique using open petri-dishes containing different culture media was employed and samplings were done twice daily, one in the morning shortly after cleaning and before influx of people/patients into the wards/units and the other in the evening when a lot of activities would have taken place in these wards. isolates were identified according to standard methods. results: results showed that there was a statistically significant difference (chi(2) = 6.016 7) in the bacteria population of the different sampling time whereas it was not so for fungi population (chi(2) = 0.285 7). male medical ward (mmw) and male surgical general  (msg) recorded the highest bacterial and fungal growth while the operating theatre (ot) was almost free of microbial burden. the bacteria isolates were staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella sp., bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes and serratia marscences while the fungi isolates included  aspergillus flavus, penicillium sp., fusarium sp., candida albicans and alternaria sp. staphylococcus aureus was the predominantly isolated bacterium while penicillium sp. was the most isolated fungus. conclusions: though most of the microbial isolates were potential and or opportunistic pathogens, there was no correlation between the isolates in this study and the surveillance report of  nosocomial infection during the period of study, hence the contribution of the indoor air cannot be established. from the reduction noticed in the morning samples, stringent measures such as proper disinfection and regular cleaning, restriction of patient relatives' movement in and out of the wards/units need to  be enforced so as to improve the quality of indoor air of our hospital wards/units.

TI  == bacterial superinfection in zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis.
AB  == background: zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (zcl) is a polymorphic disease. it is generally accepted that bacterial superinfection may play a role in the clinical appearance of the lesions and may delay or prevent the healing process.  however, the pattern of bacterial pathogens involved has rarely been investigated. material/methods: the aim of this study was to identify the bacterial species contaminating the suspected zcl and their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics. microscopic examination of stained smears and cultures were used to differentiate zcl from non-zcl lesions in a rural area north of isfahan, iran from july to december 2009. bacteria were isolated from the lesions and identified and antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard microbiological techniques. results: the results show that 602 (68%) of 855 patients were positive for zcl, of which 83.4% with volcano-shape, 8.8% psoriasiform, 6.6% popular form and 1.2% with other atypical forms of zcl. the bacteria were isolated from 66.8% of zcl (70% of volcano-shape, 60% of psoriasiform and 25% of popular form) and 64.7% of non-zcl lesions. the most common species were staphylococcus aureus (41.7%) and s. epidermidis (28%) followed by bacillus sp. streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., proteus sp., enterobacter sp. and pseudomonas aeroginosa. ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, cefazolin and clindamycin were the most effective antibiotics. conclusions: bacterial superinfection appears to be very common in zcl, but its prevalence is not different from that of non-zcl lesions and it has little effect on the clinical appearance of anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (acl). local  lesion care and management of bacterial superinfection must be considered in the  treatment of zcl.

TI  == akara ogbomoso: microbiological examination and identification of hazards and critical control points.
AB  == akara ogbomoso was examined toward the establishment of hazard analysis and critical control point (haccp). the akara was produced in residential buildings with the attendant consequence of contamination. there was ample growth of aerobes, coliforms, staphylococci, shigella and yeast/mold from the samples, water and cowpea pastes. microbial contaminations occur through the processing, which can be corrected through education by adopting good hygienic and manufacturing practices. the critical control points were identified as frying, storage and refrying. it may be heated in the microwave for 10 s before consumption. akara, prepared in the laboratory through the implementation of haccp was not contaminated. several bacterial isolates, namely; escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, bacillus cereus, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus sp. and shigella sp., showed multiple resistance to antibiotics ranging from two  to nine. seven strains were not resistant to the antibiotics, while five were resistant to one type of antibiotic.

TI  == substrate specificity of streptococcal unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolases for sulfated glycosaminoglycan.
AB  == unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase (ugl) categorized into the glycoside hydrolase family 88 catalyzes the hydrolytic release of an unsaturated glucuronic acid from glycosaminoglycan disaccharides, which are produced from mammalian extracellular  matrices through the beta-elimination reaction of polysaccharide lyases. here, we show enzyme characteristics of pathogenic streptococcal ugls and structural determinants for the enzyme substrate specificity. the putative genes for ugl and phosphotransferase system for amino sugar, a component of glycosaminoglycans, are assembled into a cluster in the genome of pyogenic and hemolytic streptococci such as streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes, which produce extracellular hyaluronate lyase as a virulent factor. the ugls of these three streptococci were overexpressed in escherichia coli cells, purified, and characterized. streptococcal ugls degraded unsaturated hyaluronate  and chondroitin disaccharides most efficiently at approximately ph 5.5 and 37 degrees c. distinct from bacillus sp. gl1 ugl, streptococcal ugls preferred sulfated substrates. dna microarray and western blotting indicated that the enzyme was constitutively expressed in s. agalactiae cells, although the expression level increased in the presence of glycosaminoglycan. the crystal structure of s. agalactiae ugl (sagugl) was determined at 1.75 a resolution by x-ray crystallography. sagugl adopts alpha(6)/alpha(6)-barrel structure as a basic scaffold similar to bacillus ugl, but the arrangement of amino acid residues in the active site differs between the two. sagugl arg-236 was found to  be one of the residues involved in its activity for the sulfated substrate through structural comparison and site-directed mutagenesis. this is the first report on the structure and function of streptococcal ugls.

TI  == efficiency of krcl excilamp (222 nm) for inactivation of bacteria in suspension.
AB  == aims: to examine the killing efficiency of uv krcl excilamp against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. methods and results: vegetative cells of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli o157:h7, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes at initial populations from 10(2) to 10(7) colony-forming  units (cfu) ml(-1) were treated by krcl excilamp in sterile ringer's solution with and without h(2)o(2). the number of viable cells was determined using spread plating techniques and nutrient agar method with subsequent incubation at 28 degrees c or 37 degrees c for 24 h. at estimated populations of 10(2)-10(5) cfu ml(-1) e. coli o157:h7 and staph. aureus were the most sensitive and showed 100%  disinfection within 15 s (29.2 mj cm(-2)). bacillus subtilis was more sensitive to uv treatment than b. cereus. the uv/h(2)o(2) inactivation rate coefficients within this population range were two times higher than those observed for uv treatment alone. no effect of h(2)o(2) was observed at 10(7) cfu ml(-1) for bacillus sp. and strep. pyogenes. conclusions: the narrow-band uv radiation at 222 nm was effective in the rapid disinfection of bacteria in aqueous suspensions. significance and impact of the study: krcl excilamps represent uv sources which can be applied for disinfection of drinking water in advanced oxidation processes.

TI  == immunohistochemical evidence of clostridium sp, staphylococcus aureus, and group  a streptococcus in severe soft tissue infections related to injection drug use.
AB  == severe soft tissue infections are caused by either single or multiple microorganisms. we performed a retrospective immunohistochemical (ihc) study on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded soft tissue samples from 20 injection drug users who were part of a cluster of severe illness and death after skin and soft  tissue infections in scotland and ireland in 2000. the ihc assays used antibodies against clostridium sp, staphylococcus aureus, group a streptococci, and bacillus anthracis. intact bacilli and granular clostridium antigen staining in areas with necrosis, edema, and inflammation were observed in skin, fascia, or muscle samples of 12 (60%) patients. a variety of clostridia were isolated from affected soft tissues in 10 ihc-positive cases. staphylococcus aureus antigens were observed in 3 cases including 1 where s aureus was isolated, 1 with negative cultures, and 1 where mixed cultures were obtained. group a streptococcal antigens were observed in 1 case in which streptococcus pyogenes and s aureus were isolated. by using ihc, we detected different bacteria in archival soft tissue samples from patients with severe skin and soft tissue infections. immunohistochemical assays can be of great diagnostic value, particularly for bacteria such as clostridium sp, which are difficult to isolate because of their  anaerobic fastidious growth requirements.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == a novel member of glycoside hydrolase family 88: overexpression, purification, and characterization of unsaturated beta-glucuronyl hydrolase of bacillus sp. gl1.
AB  == unsaturated beta-glucuronyl hydrolase of bacillus sp. gl1 catalyzes the hydrolytic release of unsaturated glucuronic acids from oligosaccharides produced through the reactions of polysaccharide lyases such as gellan, xanthan, hyaluronate, and chondroitin lyases. an overexpression system for the enzyme was  constructed in escherichia coli cells involving regulation of the enzyme gene under the t7 promoter and terminator. the expression level of the enzyme in e. coli cells was 250-fold higher than that in bacillus sp. gl1 cells. the enzyme expressed in e. coli cells was purified and characterized. the optimal ph and temperature, and substrate specificity of the purified enzyme were similar to those of the native enzyme from bacillus sp. gl1 cells, although the enzyme expressed in e. coli cells underwent self-assembly into polymeric forms through the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds. circular dichroism analysis indicated that the secondary structure of the enzyme was rich in alpha-helices. genes showing high identity (over 40% identity) with that of the enzyme were found in the genomes of some pathogenic bacteria, such as streptococcus pyogenes  and streptococcus pneumoniae, which cause serious diseases (e.g., meningitis and  pneumonia). therefore, the enzyme of bacillus sp. gl1 and the streptococcal proteins form a new glycoside hydrolase family, 88.

TI  == bacterial superinfection in human tungiasis.
AB  == tungiasis is caused by penetration of the female sand flea tunga penetrans into the epidermis of its host. it is endemic in many countries in latin america, the  caribbean and sub-saharan africa. although superinfection is a common clinical observation, the frequency and the pattern of bacterial pathogens associated with tungiasis have never been investigated systematically. we conducted a prospective clinico-bacteriological study with patients living in a shantytown in fortaleza,  capital of ceara state (northeast brazil), where tungiasis is hyperendemic. swabs were taken from 78 patients with multiple lesions after surgical extraction of the parasite, and the specimens were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. ninety-nine specimens were investigated for aerobic bacteria, from which 146 pathogens were identified. the most common species were staphyloccous aureus (35.5%) and various enterobacteriaceae (29.5%). bacillus sp., enteroccous faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and pseudomonas sp. were also isolated. eighty-four anaerobic cultures yielded 20 pathogens: in eight cases we  detected peptostreptococcus sp., in seven cases clostridium sp., and in five cases non-identifiable gram-negative bacilli. these results show that secondary infection is very common in tungiasis, and caused by a variety of highly pathogenic microorganisms. it is proposed that t. penetrans acts as a foreign body facilitating biofilm formation within the epidermis. to prevent spreading of pathogens to the surrounding tissue and/or the systemic circulation, sand fleas should be surgically extracted immediately after penetration.

TI  == rho is not essential for viability or virulence in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == we have identified the gene for transcription termination factor rho in staphylococcus aureus. deletion of rho in s. aureus reveals that it is not essential for viability or virulence. we also searched the available bacterial genomic sequences for homologs of rho and found that it is broadly distributed and highly conserved. exceptions include streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus  pyogenes, mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma pneumoniae, ureaplasma urealyticum, and synechocystis sp. strain pcc6803, all of which appear not to possess a rho homolog. complementation studies indicate that s. aureus rho possesses the same activity as escherichia coli rho and that the rho inhibitor bicyclomycin is active against s. aureus rho. our results explain the lack of activity of bicyclomycin against many gram-positive bacteria and raise the possibility that the essentiality of rho may be the exception rather than the rule.

TI  == antibacterial activity of orobanche cernua extract.
AB  == the effect of the parasitic plant orobanche cernua extract was evaluated on 5 different gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. dilution experiments show that the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic; microgram/ml) of the extract was  as follows: staphylococcus aureus-1526.5; streptococcus sp.-3125; streptococcus pyogenes-25,000 and both for bacillus cereus and escherichia coli-50,000 micrograms/ml. data indicated that the mic of 3125 micrograms/ml is equal to cefotaxime (30 micrograms) and tobromycin (10 micrograms) activity against streptococcus sp. and s. aureus, respectively; 25,000 and 50,000 micrograms/ml is equal to cefotaxime (30 micrograms) activity against s. pyogenes and b. cereus, respectively, and 50,000 micrograms/ml is equal to nalidixic acid (30 micrograms) activity against e. coli. it can be concluded that the o. cernua extract displays remarkable activity against some gram-positive bacteria such as streptococcus and staphylococcus.

TI  == rapid identification of burkholderia pseudomallei in blood cultures by a monoclonal antibody assay.
AB  == burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioidosis. in northeast thailand, this gram-negative bacterium is a major cause of mortality from septicemia. the definitive diagnosis of this disease is made by bacterial culture. in this study, we produced a monoclonal antibody (mab) specific to the 30-kda protein of b. pseudomallei by in vivo and in vitro immunization of balb/c  mice with a crude culture filtrate antigen. the mab could directly agglutinate with all 243 clinical isolates of b. pseudomallei but not with other gram-negative bacteria, except for one strain of burkholderia mallei. however, the mab cross-reacted with the gram-positive bacillus sp. and streptococcus pyogenes. b. pseudomallei in brain heart infusion broth (bhib) subcultured from a bact/alert automated blood culture system could be identified by simple agglutination with this mab assay. the sensitivity and specificity of direct agglutination compared to the "gold standard," the culture method, were 94.12 and 98.25%, respectively. however, the mab adsorbed to polystyrene beads or latex particles directly identified the bacterium in blood culture specimens and in bhib subcultured from a bact/alert automated blood culture system. the sensitivity of the latex agglutination test was 100% for both blood culture and bhib specimens. the specificity was 85.96 and 96.49% for the blood culture and bhib specimens, respectively. the specificity could be increased if the nonspecific materials in the blood culture broths were eradicated by centrifugation at low speeds. thus, a combination of blood culture and the agglutination method could be used for the rapid diagnosis of melioidosis in the  routine bacteriological laboratory. this method could speed up detection of the bacterium in blood culture by at least 2 days, compared to the conventional bacterial culture method. in addition, the mab is stable at room temperature for  2 weeks and at 4, -20, and -70 degrees c for at least 1 year. the latex reagent was stable for at least 6 months at 4 degrees c.

TI  == [main infectious agents involved in the etiology of lung diseases of small ruminants in northern cameroon].
AB  == between 1990 and 1992, 91 necropsies of small ruminants affected with pulmonary illness led to the isolation of the following strains of mycoplasma (m.): m. mycoides subsp. mycoides lc, m. ovipneumoniae, m. agalactiae, m. sp. type d2 and  m. arginini. eleven pasteurella multocida strains (serotypes a1, a3, a5, a7 and d2) and 11 pasteurella haemolytica strains (serotypes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 and 9) were isolated. corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, actinomyces pyogenes, staphylococcus sp., streptococcus sp., bacillus sp. and mycobacterium sp. were also isolated. thirty-two antibiograms were performed on pasteurella, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and actinomyces pyogenes strains. eighty eight p. cent were sensitive to penicillin g and oxytetracycline, and 84% to chloramphenicol; 50% were not sensitive to spiramycin and 47% to streptomycin. one capripoxvirus strain was isolated on sheep. pest of small ruminants (ppr) virus was detected by immunocapture elisa test performed on some lung samples. two serological surveys, one for contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (898 goats),  between 1991 and 1993, and one for ppr (902 sheep and goats) in 1993, were conducted in the north and far north provinces. no antibody against contagious caprine pleuropneumonia was detected. among the animals in the sample, ppr prevalence was 64 +/- 7% in the far north province and 14 +/- 3% in the north province. concerning control measures, a vaccination campaign against small ruminant pasteurellosis appears to be hardly feasible because of the antigenic diversity of the isolated pasteurella strains. ppr is endemic especially in the far north province. the efficiency of a vaccination campaign against ppr must be  estimated with a field survey.

TI  == evaluation of a scheme for predicting the gram-staining reaction of organisms causing bovine mastitis.
AB  == the accuracy of a scheme for predicting the gram-staining reaction of organisms causing bovine mastitis in cows with systemic signs of disease (anorexia) was evaluated over 1 year. criteria for making the predictions included: season of year, stage of lactation, appearance of milk, detection and duration of teat injuries, and milk odor. it was possible to determine the cause by microbiologic  culture of specimens from 136 of the 147 cows of the study. of 78 infections caused by gram-negative (mostly coliform) organisms, 62 (79%) were predicted accurately to be caused by gram-negative organisms. of 57 infections caused by gram-positive organisms, 45 (79%) were predicted correctly to be caused by gram-positive organisms. correctly predicted as gram-positive organisms causing infection were: actinomyces pyogenes in 20 of 21 (95%) cows; staphylococcus sp in 14 of 22 (64%) cows; streptococcus sp in 10 of 13 (77%) cows and bacillus sp in 1 cow. overall accuracy, in those instances when bacteria were isolated (136 cows), was 78%.

TI  == detection of bacterial cell wall hydrolases after denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  == cell walls from various gram-positive bacteria were incorporated at a concentration of 0.2% (w/v) into polyacrylamide gels as a substrate for detection of cell wall hydrolases. bacterial extracts from crude cell wall preparations were denatured with sodium dodecyl sulfate and 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in gels containing bacterial cell walls. after renaturation in the presence of purified and buffered 1% (v/v) triton x-100, cell wall hydrolases were visualized as clear lytic zones against the opaque cell wall background. one to fifteen bands with lytic activity could be detected, depending on bacterial extracts and on the nature of the cell walls  incorporated into gels. crude cell wall extracts were the best source of cell wall hydrolases from various gram-positive bacteria such as clostridium perfringens (15 bands), micrococcus luteus (1 band), bacillus megaterium (4 bands), bacillus sp. (6 bands), b. cereus (3 bands), b. subtilis (7 bands), staphylococcus aureus (13 bands), streptococcus faecalis (3 bands), and strep. pyogenes (5 bands). molecular masses of cell wall hydrolases ranged from 17 to 114.6 kda. lytic activities against cell walls of corynebacterium sepedonicum (clavibacter michiganense pv. sepedonicum) could be shown with the cell wall extracts of strep. pyogenes (45.7 kda), strep. faecalis (67 kda), b. megaterium (67 kda), and staph. aureus (67 kda).
