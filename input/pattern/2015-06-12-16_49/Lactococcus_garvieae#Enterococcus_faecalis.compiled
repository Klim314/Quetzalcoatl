TI  - Enhanced expression of fucosyl GA1 in the digestive tract of immune-deficient scid, nude and pIgR(-/-) mice.
AB  - Fucosylation of GA1 in murine intestinal epithelia occurs through transcriptional induction of alpha1,2-fucosyltransferase along with bacterial infection, but the mechanism has not been clearly characterized as to whether it is induced as a result of an immune response to bacteria or of genetic manipulation of the host by bacteria. Accordingly, we analysed the expression of fucosyl GA1 (FGA1) and fucosyltransferase activity in the digestive tracts of immune-deficient scid, nude and pIgR(-/-) mice. In comparison with those in control mice bred under the same SPF circumstances, the amount of FGA1 and the alpha1,2-fucosyltransferase activity were significantly increased in the immune-deficient mice, indicating that the immune system is not involved in induction of the alpha1,2-fucosyltransferase gene. Reflecting the enhanced synthesis of FGA1, the total amounts of FGA1 in the intestinal contents of immune-deficient mice were higher than those in control mice. Also, the major faecal bacteria grown on a MRS agar plate were different in immune-deficient and control mice as follows, Lactobacillus murinus for scid and pIgR(-/-) mice, and Lactobacillus johnsonii for their control, and Enterococcus faecalis for nude mice and Lactococcus garvieae for the control, indicating that an alteration in the intestinal lactobacilli is partly involved in the induction of alpha1,2-fucosyltransferase.
TI  - Development of a selective and differential medium for capsulated Lactococcus garvieae.
AB  - A selective and differential medium termed 'LG agar' was developed for the isolation and presumptive identification of Lactococcus garvieae that results in black colonies with red halos. In this study, all 14 strains of L. garvieae and only 9 of the 148 strains representing 38 other species were able to grow on the LG agar. The nine viable strains on LG agar plates (including Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactococcus lactis, Vibrio fluvialis, Vibrio furnissii, Vibrio mimicus and Vibrio salmonicida) were further differentiated from L. garvieae by various colours or colony features. Colonies isolated from the mixing culture and the infected giant sea perch using LG agar plates were all positively identified as L. garvieae by conventional tests and 16S rDNA sequencing. Furthermore, LG agar discriminated capsulated strains of L. garvieae, which were believed to be correlated with pathogens of fish and shellfish, from non-capsulated ones by colony appearances. The specificity and differentiating ability of LG agar suggest that this medium displays considerable potential for primary isolation and presumptive identification of L. garvieae from pathological and environmental samples.
TI  - Oxalate-degrading capacities of lactic acid bacteria in canine feces.
AB  - In this study, lactic acid bacteria in canine feces were isolated and identified, and their oxalate-degrading capacities were evaluated. The oxalate-degrading capacities were determined for 24 of 47 (51.06%) lactic acid bacteria isolates. Of these, 8 isolates [Leuconostoc mesenteroides (RL75), Lactococcus garvieae (CD2), Lactococcus subsp. lactis (CS21), Enterococcus faecium (CL71 and CL72), and Enterococcus faecalis (CD14, CS62, and CD12)] degraded more than 5% of the oxalate present, while the others degraded less than 5% of the oxalate in vitro. Isolates that degraded more than 5% of the oxalate present were selected for further examination. The oxalate-degrading capacities of individual isolates, a mixture of Enterococcus, a mixture of Lactococcus, and a mixture of the eight isolates were evaluated in media containing different concentrations of glucose (sufficient, insufficient, or no glucose). In comparison with the control medium, all of the individual isolates and mixtures of isolates could degrade oxalate in all three groups (P<0.05). In most cases, the isolates growing in medium with 20 g/L of glucose had higher oxalate-degrading capacities than those growing in medium with 2.5 g/L of glucose or no glucose. The mixture of all isolates showed higher oxalate-degrading capacity than the individual isolates and other mixtures. The oxalate-degrading capacities of the isolates were isolate dependent.
TI  - Detection of human intestinal catalase-negative, Gram-positive cocci by rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-PCR.
AB  - An analytical system based on rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) for enumeration of catalase-negative, Gram-positive cocci was established. Subgroup- or species-specific primer sets targeting 16S or 23S rRNA from Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Lactococcus were newly developed. The RT-qPCR method using these primers together with the previously reported primer sets specific for the Enterococcus genus, the Streptococcus genus, and several Streptococcus species was found to be able to quantify the target populations with detection limits of 10(3) to 10(4) cells per gram feces, which was more than 100 times as sensitive as the qPCR method (10(6) to 10(8) cells per gram feces). The RT-qPCR analysis of fecal samples from 24 healthy adult volunteers using the genus-specific primer sets revealed that Enterococcus and Streptococcus were present as intestinal commensals at population levels of log(10) 6.2 +/- 1.4 and 7.5 +/- 0.9 per gram feces (mean +/- standard deviation [SD]), respectively. Detailed investigation using species- or subgroup-specific primer sets revealed that the volunteers harbored unique Enterococcus species, including the E. avium subgroup, the E. faecium subgroup, E. faecalis, the E. casseliflavus subgroup, and E. caccae, while the dominant human intestinal Streptococcus species was found to be S. salivarius. Various Lactococcus species, such as L. lactis subsp. lactis or L. lactis subsp. cremoris, L. garvieae, L. piscium, and L. plantarum, were also detected but at a lower population level (log(10) 4.6 +/- 1.2 per gram feces) and prevalence (33%). These results suggest that the RT-qPCR method enables the accurate and sensitive enumeration of human intestinal subdominant but still important populations, such as Gram-positive cocci.
TI  - A transferable 20-kilobase multiple drug resistance-conferring R plasmid (pKL0018) from a fish pathogen (Lactococcus garvieae) is highly homologous to a conjugative multiple drug resistance-conferring enterococcal plasmid.
AB  - Lactococcus garvieae, the causative agent of lactococcosis, has evolved strains that are highly resistant to antibiotics. Here, the 20,034-bp sequence of L. garvieae conjugative plasmid pKL0018 was determined. It contained two ermB genes and one tetS gene and a backbone more than 96% identical to that of pRE25, an Enterococcus faecalis plasmid from dry sausage.
TI  - Drug resistance mechanism of the fish-pathogenic bacterium Lactococcus garvieae.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 15 chemotherapeutic agents were tested against 146 Lactococcus garvieae strains isolated from 1999 to 2006 in Japan. The agents used included chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin (EM), enoxacin, fleroxacin, florfenicol, kanamycin, lincomycin (LCM), norfloxacin, oxolinic acid, orbifloxacin, ofloxacin, benzylpenicillin, streptomycin and tetracycline (TC). Of the tested strains, 46 showed high levels of resistance to EM, LCM and TC. Twelve of these strains were detected to be carrying transferable R-plasmids using a conjugation experiment and, using Southern hybridization, were shown to have the same structure as the R-plasmid. The remaining 34 resistant strains had a similar DNA structure to that of the R-plasmid as confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers designed from sites in the transferable R-plasmid. The EM and TC resistance genes were classified into the ermB and tetS groups using PCR. We also detected gyrA and/or parC mutants that are highly resistant to old and new generation quinolones. This study revealed that transferable R-plasmids encoding EM, LCM and TC are widely distributed and are conserved regardless of the area and/or time of collection.
TI  - Effect of Lactococcus garvieae, Lactococcus lactis and Enterococcus faecalis on the behaviour of Staphylococcus aureus in microfiltered milk.
AB  - The effect of four strains of Lactococcus garvieae, three strains of Lactococcus  lactis and one strain of Enterococcus faecalis on Staphylococcus aureus SA15 growth in microfiltered milk was evaluated. Lactococcus and Enterococcus strains were co-cultured with S. aureus in microfiltered milk and in medium buffered at pH 6.8. All Lactococcus and Enterococcus strains were able to inhibit S. aureus growth after 6h of incubation. Inhibition by L. lactis and E. faecalis strains could be partially attributed to the decrease in pH below 6.0 as it has been observed in medium buffered at pH 6.8. L. garvieae strains were the most effective to inhibit S. aureus growth without acidification. Inhibition of S. aureus could not be attributed neither to production of lactate, acetate or nor to antistaphylococcal substance. Amino acids competition was not involved in the inhibition by L. garvieae as addition of valine, isoleucine, threonine, methionine and phenylalanine did not suppress the inhibition of S. aureus.
TI  - Stability of microbial communities in goat milk during a lactation year: molecular approaches.
AB  - The microbial communities in milks from one herd were evaluated during 1-year of  lactation, using molecular methods to evaluate their stability and the effect of breeding conditions on their composition. The diversity of microbial communities was measured using two approaches: molecular identification by 16S and 18S rDNA sequencing of isolates from counting media (two milks), and direct identification using 16S rDNA from clone libraries (six milks). The stability of these communities was evaluated by counting on selective media and by Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of variable region V3 of the 16S rRNA gene and variable region V4 of the 18S rRNA gene. One hundred and eighteen milk samples taken throughout the year were analyzed. Wide diversity among bacteria and yeasts in the milk was revealed. In addition to species commonly encountered in milk, such as Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus garvieae, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus casei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus simulans, Staphylococcus caprae, Staphylococcus equorum, Micrococcus sp., Kocuria sp., Pantoea agglomerans and Pseudomonas putida, sequences were affiliated to other species only described in cheeses, such as Corynebacterium variabile, Arthrobacter sp., Brachybacterium paraconglomeratum, Clostridium sp. and Rothia sp. Several halophilic species atypical in milk were found, belonging to Jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, Salinicoccus sp., Dietza maris, Exiguobacterium, Ornithinicoccus sp. and Hahella chejuensis. The yeast community was composed of Debaryomyces hansenii, Kluyveromyces lactis, Trichosporon beigelii, Rhodotorula glutinis, Rhodotorula minuta, Candida pararugosa, Candida intermedia, Candida inconspicua, Cryptococcus curvatus and Cryptococcus magnus. The analyses of microbial counts and microbial SSCP profiles both distinguished four groups of milks corresponding to four periods defined by season and feeding regime. The microbial community was stable within each period. Milks from winter were characterized by Lactococcus and Pseudomonas, those from summer by P. agglomerans and Klebsiella and those from autumn by Chryseobacterium indologenes, Acinetobacter baumanii, Staphylococcus, Corynebacteria and yeasts. However, the composition of the community can vary according to factors other than feeding. This study opens new investigation fields in the field of raw milk microbial ecology.
TI  - Antimicrobial and safety aspects, and biotechnological potential of bacteriocinogenic enterococci isolated from mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).
AB  - Samples from the intestinal content and carcasses of mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) were evaluated for enterococci with antimicrobial activity, presence of genes coding bacteriocins and their expression, and potential virulence factors. Enterococcus faecalis comprised the largest enterococcal species with antagonistic activity followed by E. faecium, E. hirae, Enterococcus spp., and the non-enterococci. Although all E. faecalis isolates manifested a potent direct antimicrobial activity, no activity was detected in supernatants of most producer cultures. However, all E. faecium isolates showed antimicrobial activity in their supernatants and encoded bacteriocins, although the occurrence in the isolates of several enterocin genes did not always correlate with a higher antagonistic activity in supernatants. The efaAfm determinant was the only virulence gene detected in E. faecium, while E. faecalis showed a larger number of virulence determinants, and E. hirae did not carry any of the virulence genes examined. The rapid identification of genes coding described bacteriocins permits recognition of isolates that are potentially producers of novel bacteriocins. Purification of the antimicrobial activity of E. hirae DCH5 and Lactococcus garvieae DCC43 revealed unique chromatographic fragments after MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis, suggesting the antagonistic peptides were purified to homogeneity. Bacteriocinogenic E. faecium and E. hirae isolates may be considered hygienic for production of bacteriocins, and potentially safe due to their low incidence of potential virulence genes and susceptibility to most clinically relevant antibiotics. However, the presence among the enterococci of E. faecalis strains with a potent antagonistic activity and multiple virulence factors, raises concerns regarding their potential pathogenicity to consumers.
TI  - Biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria in Moroccan soft white cheese (Jben).
AB  - The bacterial diversity occurring in traditional Moroccan soft white cheese, produced in eight different regions in Morocco, was studied. A total of 164 lactic acid bacteria were isolated, purified and identified by whole-cell protein fingerprinting and rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting. The majority of the strains belonged to the genera Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc and Enterococcus. Sixteen species were identified: Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus buchneri, Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus garvieae, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc citreum, Eterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus saccharominimus and Streptococcus sp.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of Carnobacterium, Lactococcus, and Enterococcus spp. from cooked, modified atmosphere packaged, refrigerated, poultry meat.
AB  - The microbiota of commercially produced, cooked and modified atmosphere packaged  poultry meat was followed during storage at 3.5 degrees C for up to 7 weeks. The dominant microbiota consisted of Lactococcus raffinolactis (117 isolates), Carnobacterium divergens (61 isolates), Carnobacterium piscicola (11 isolates), Lactococcus garvieae (four isolates), Lactococcus lactis (one isolate) and Enterococcus faecalis (three isolates). All isolates were screened for production of bacteriocins. Only C. piscicola isolates produced an inhibitory substance active against other lactic acid bacteria and against several Listeria spp. Species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were used for the differentiation of Carnobacterium, L. raffinolactis, L. lactis, and L. garvieae strains associated with the modified atmosphere packaged poultry products. No false PCR products were observed with other closely related bacterial species.
TI  - Identification of Enterococcus species and phenotypically similar Lactococcus and Vagococcus species by reverse checkerboard hybridization to chaperonin 60 gene sequences.
AB  - Data from four recent studies (S. H. Goh et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 36:2164-2166, 1998; S. H. Goh et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 34:818-823, 1996; S. H. Goh et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 35:3116-3121, 1997; A. Y. C. Kwok et al., Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 49:1181-1192, 1999) suggest that an approximately 600-bp region of the chaperonin 60 (Cpn60) gene, amplified by PCR with a single pair of degenerate primers, has utility as a potentially universal target for bacterial identification (ID). This Cpn60 gene ID method correctly identified isolates representative of numerous staphylococcal species and Streptococcus iniae, a human and animal pathogen. We report herein that this method enabled us to distinguish clearly between 17 Enterococcus species (Enterococcus asini, Enterococcus rattus, Enterococcus dispar, Enterococcus gallinarum, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus cecorum, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus mundtii, Enterococcus casseliflavus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus malodoratus, Enterococcus raffinosus, Enterococcus avium, Enterococcus pseudoavium, Enterococcus new sp. strain Facklam, and Enterococcus saccharolyticus), and Vagococcus fluvialis, Lactococcus lactis, and Lactococcus garvieae. From 123 blind-tested samples, only two discrepancies were observed between the Facklam and Collins phenotyping method (R. R. Facklam and M. D. Collins, J. Clin. Microbiol. 27:731-734, 1989) and the Cpn60 ID method. In each case, the discrepancies were resolved in favor of the Cpn60 ID method. The species distributions of the 123 blind-tested isolates were Enterococcus new sp. strain Facklam (ATCC 700913), 3; E. asini, 1; E. rattus, 4; E. dispar, 2; E. gallinarum, 20; E. hirae, 9; E. durans, 9; E. faecalis, 12; E. mundtii, 3; E. casseliflavus, 8; E. faecium, 25; E. malodoratus, 3; E. raffinosus, 8; E. avium, 4; E. pseudoavium, 1; an unknown Enterococcus clinical isolate, sp. strain R871; Vagococcus fluvialis, 4; Lactococcus garvieae, 3; Lactococcus lactis, 3; Leuconostoc sp., 1; and Pediococcus sp., 1. The Cpn60 gene ID method, coupled with reverse checkerboard hybridization, is an effective method for the identification of Enterococcus and related organisms.
TI  - Identification of aesculin-hydrolyzing streptococci, lactococci, aerococci and enterococci from subclinical intramammary infections in dairy cows.
AB  - Aesculin-hydrolyzing, catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci isolated from subclinical intramammary infections in dairy cows were identified to species level using growth characteristics and biochemical activity. The results indicated that the aesculin-hydrolyzing cocci associated with this type of infection are a very heterogenic group. S. uberis strains, including inulin- or beta-glucuronidase-negative isolates, accounted for only about one-third of the collection, and Enterococcus faecalis strains for one-fifth. Other species of some importance included (in descending order of isolation frequency) Aerococcus viridans, Streptococcus pluranimalium, Lactococcus garvieae, Streptococcus bovis and Streptococcus gallolyticus.
TI  - Use of tests for acidification of methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside and susceptibility to efrotomycin for differentiation of strains of Enterococcus and some related genera.
AB  - A total of 107 Enterococcus strains, 10 Vagococcus fluvialis strains, and 8 Lactococcus garvieae strains were tested for acidification of methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside (MGP) and susceptibility to 100-microg efrotomycin (EFRO) disks. All 26 strains of Enterococcus casseliflavus, including 3 nonmotile and 2 nonpigmented strains, acidified MGP and were resistant to EFRO. All 22 strains of Enterococcus gallinarum, including 5 nonmotile strains, also acidified MGP and were resistant to EFRO. None of the 26 strains of Enterococcus faecium acidified MGP, and all were susceptible to EFRO. Although all 12 Enterococcus faecalis strains were also negative in the MGP test, they were resistant to EFRO. Other enterococcal strains gave variable results. All 10 strains of V. fluvialis and all 8 strains of L. garvieae gave positive and negative results, respectively, in the MGP test and were, respectively, resistant and susceptible to EFRO. These results indicate that tests of the production of acid from MGP and susceptibility to EFRO can be used as adjunct tests in the identification of typical and atypical strains of enterococci in the clinical microbiology laboratory.
