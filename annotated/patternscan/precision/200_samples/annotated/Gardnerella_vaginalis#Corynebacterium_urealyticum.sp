TI == culture-independent identification of pathogenic bacteria and polymicrobial infections in the genitourinary tract of renal transplant recipients.
AB == renal transplant recipients are predisposed to urinary tract infections caused by both common uropathogens and opportunistic bacteria resulting frequently in significant polymicrobial infections. in this study, a culture-independent 16s rrna-based approach was established to identify unusual, fastidious, or anaerobic bacteria and to investigate bacterial diversity in urinary tract specimens. similarly sized amplicons encompassing the v6 to v8 region of the 16s rrna were analyzed with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dhplc) (wave system). artificial mixtures of single amplicons from commonly encountered uropathogenic bacteria produced distinct peak profiles whose identities were confirmed by sequencing individually collected peak products. we evaluated the application of the method on 109 urinary tract specimens from renal transplant recipients; 100% correlation was found for culture-positive specimens, and dhplc generated peak profiles. however, for culture-negative specimens, dhplc facilitated the detection of novel peak profiles. dna sequencing of these individual peaks was used to identify the bacteria involved. thus, in pcr-positive but culture-negative samples the method allowed detection of previously known uropathogens such as corynebacterium urealyticum and gardnerella vaginalis, but also unusual agents including anaerococcus lactolyticus, bacteroides vulgatus, dialister invisus, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus iners, leptotrichia amnionii, prevotella buccalis, prevotella ruminicola, rahnella aquatilis, and streptococcus intermedius were detected as single pathogens or as constituents of polymicrobial infections. the method described is reproducible and rapidly and enables both dhplc-based profiling and sequence-based investigation of microbial communities and polymicrobial infections. a detailed understanding of infections found in recipients of renal transplants will guide antibiotic therapy regimens and provide new perspectives for decreasing the risk of graft rejection.

TI == the acute urethral syndrome in routine practice.
AB == midstream samples of urine from 185 acutely dysuric women and 89 symptom-free controls were screened according to the modified criteria of kass by both conventional and microaerophilic culture. among the 185 symptomatic women, coliform bacilli were isolated from 125 (67.5%) and in 45 (36%) of the latter the concentration of these organisms in the urine was less than 10(8)/l. fastidious organisms were isolated in pure and mixed cultures from 25 (13.4%) of the 185 patients and from 4 (4.5%) of 89 controls. staphylococcus species were isolated from 10.8% (9.7% s. saprophyticus; 1.1% s. epidermidis) and ureaplasma urealyticum from 2.7%. all patients infected with conventional organisms but only 30.4% of those yielding fastidious organisms had pyuria. the isolation rate of fastidious organisms tended to be higher (p = 0.055) in symptomatic women that in symptom-free controls.

TI == vaginitis in sexually active women: relationship to nine sexually transmitted organisms.
AB == women seen for symptoms suggestive of vulvovaginitis were studied for the detection of mycoplasma hominis. ureaplasma urealyticum, yeast, neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, gardnerella vaginalis, herpes simplex virus, group b beta-hemolytic streptococci, aerobes, anaerobes, and trichomonas vaginalis. asymptomatic women who reported to be sexually active and agreed to undergo comprehensive genital cultures were used as controls. there was a significant association of vulvovaginitis with the recovery of sexually transmitted organisms. however, all organisms were also recovered from asymptomatic patients. a total of 468 sexually transmitted organisms were recovered from 253 symptomatic patients (1.85 organisms per patient), while 125 were recovered from 130 asymptomatic patients (0.96 organisms per patient). the difference in prevalence between symptomatic and asymptomatic women for chlamydia trachomatis, group b streptococcus, and the mycoplasmas was not statistically significant. factors that predispose patients to the manifestations of symptoms are not clearly understood.
