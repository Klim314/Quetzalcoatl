TI  - Antimicrobial resistance profile of Enterococcus species isolated from intestinal tracts of hospitalized patients in Jimma, Ethiopia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multi-drug-resistant Enterococci colonizing the intestinal tract of hospitalized patients are the major source of infection as well as nosocomial spread. Despite worldwide increasing rate of multidrug resistant Enterococci colonization and infection among hospitalized patients, there is scarcity of data from resource limited setting. The present study aimed at determining the antimicrobial resistance profile of Enterococcus species from intestinal tracts of hospitalized patients in Jimma, Ethiopia. METHODS: The study was conducted among hospitalized patients at Jimma University Specialized Hospital, from January to July 2013. Fecal samples were collected and processed for bacterial isolation and susceptibility testing to antimicrobial agents. Stool samples were inoculated onto enterococcus selective media (Bile Esculin azide agar plate) with and without 6 microg/ml of vancomycin. The isolates were identified to genus and species level by cultural characteristics, Gram's stain, catalase test, growth in 6.5% NaCl broth, growth at 45 degrees C, motility test and by using API 20 Streptococcus system. Sensitivity testing was done using Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Minimum inhibitory concentrations for vancomycin were determined using E-test strips. RESULT: Overall, Enterococci were isolated from 114 (76%) of the study subjects. The isolates were Enterococcus faecium (35.1%) followed by Enterococcus faecalis (29.8%), Enterococcus gallinarum (17.5%), Enterococcus casseliflavus (8.8%) and Enterococcus durans (8.8%). Among 114 tested Enterococci isolates, 41 (36%) were resistant to ampicillin, 62 (54.4%) to streptomycin and 39 (34.2%) to gentamycin. Other alternative antibiotics to treat mixed nosocomial infection caused by Enterococci also showed high rate of resistance in vitro: ciprofloxacin (50% of resistance), norfloxacin (49.1%), erythromycin (63.2%), tetracycline (64.9%), chloramphenicol (34.2%), and nitrofrantoin (32.4%). Multiple drug resistance was observed among 89.5% of E. faecium and E. faecalis. Vancomycin resistant Enterococci were observed in 5% of E. faecium isolates. CONCLUSION: This study reveals high rate of fecal colonization by multidrug-resistant Enterococci and prevalence of vancomycin resistance strains. Thus periodic surveillance of antibacterial susceptibilities is recommended to detect emerging resistance and to prevent the spread of antibacterial-resistant strains.
TI  - Diversity of enterococcal species and characterization of high-level aminoglycoside resistant enterococci of samples of wastewater and surface water in Tunisia.
AB  - One hundred-fourteen samples of wastewater (n=64) and surface-water (n=50) were inoculated in Slanetz-Bartley agar plates supplemented or not with gentamicin (SB-Gen and SB plates, respectively) for enterococci recovery. Enterococci were obtained from 75% of tested samples in SB media (72% in wastewater; 78% in surface-water), and 85 enterococcal isolates (one/positive-sample) were obtained. Enterococcus faecium was the most prevalent species (63.5%), followed by Enterococcus faecalis (20%), Enterococcus hirae (9.4%), Enterococcus casseliflavus (4.7%), and Enterococcus gallinarum/Enterococcus durans (2.4%). Antibiotic resistance detected among these enterococci was as follows [percentage/detected gene (number isolates)]: kanamycin [29%/aph(3')-IIIa (n=22)], streptomycin [8%/ant(6)-Ia (n=4)], erythromycin [44%/erm(B) (n=34)], tetracycline [18%/tet(M) (n=6)/tet(M)-tet(L) (n=9)], chloramphenicol [2%/cat(A) (n=1)], ciprofloxacin [7%] and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [94%]. High-level-gentamicin resistant (HLR-G) enterococci were recovered from 15 samples in SB-Gen or SB plates [12/64 samples of wastewater (19%) and 3/50 samples of surface-water (6%)]; HLR-G isolates were identified as E. faecium (n=7), E. faecalis (n=6), and E. casseliflavus (n=2). These HLR-G enterococci carried the aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia and erm(B) genes, in addition to aph(3')-IIIa (n=10), ant(6)-Ia (n=9), tet(M) (n=13), tet(L) (n=8) and cat(A) genes (n=2). Three HLR-G enterococci carried the esp virulence gene. Sequence-types detected among HLR-G enterococci were as follows: E. faecalis (ST480, ST314, ST202, ST55, and the new ones ST531 and ST532) and E. faecium (ST327, ST12, ST296, and the new ones ST985 and ST986). Thirty-two different PFGE patterns were detected among 36 high-level-aminoglycoside-resistant enterococci recovered in water samples. Diverse genetic lineages of HLR-G enterococci were detected in wastewater and surface-water in Tunisia. Water can represent an important source for the dissemination of these antibiotic resistant microorganisms to other environments.
TI  - Characterization of an Enterococcus gallinarum carrying dual vanA and vanB cassette.
AB  - The ability of vancomycin resistance determinants to be horizontally transferred  within enterococci species is a concern. Identification and characterization of vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) in a clinical isolate has a significant impact on infection control practices. In this study, we describe a clinical isolate of E. gallinarum exhibiting high level resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin. Genetic characterization of this isolate showed the presence of vanA and vanB genes in addition to naturally carrying vanC gene. vanA was identified on pA6981, a 35,608-bp circular plasmid with significant homology to plasmid pS177. vanB operon was integrated into the bacterial chromosome and showed high level of homology to previously reported Tn1549 and Tn5382. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of E. gallinarum carrying both vanA and vanB operons, indicating the importance of identifying vancomycin resistance mechanism in non- E. faecium and -E. faecalis enterococcal species.
TI  - Occurrence and antimicrobial resistance of enterococci isolated from organic and  conventional retail chicken.
AB  - Antibiotic-resistant bacteria existing in agricultural environments may be transferred to humans through food consumption or more multifaceted environmental paths of exposure. Notably, enterococcal infections are becoming more challenging to treat as their resistance to antibiotics intensifies. In this study, the prevalence and antibiotic resistance profiles of enterococci in organic and conventional chicken from retail stores were analyzed. Of the total 343 retail chicken samples evaluated, 282 (82.2%) were contaminated with Enterococcus spp. The prevalence was higher in organic chicken (62.5%) than conventional chicken (37.5%). Enterococcus isolates were submitted to susceptibility tests against 12 antimicrobial agents. Among the isolates tested, streptomycin had the highest frequencies of resistance (69.1 and 100%) followed by erythromycin (38.5 and 80.0%), penicillin (14.1 and 88.5%), and kanamycin (11.3 and 76.9%) for organic and conventional isolates, respectively. Chloramphenicol had the lowest frequency (0.0 and 6.6%, respectively). The predominant species in raw chicken was E. faecium (27.3%), followed by E. gallinarum (6.0%), E. casseliflavus (2.1%), and E. durans (1.4%). These species were also found to be resistant to three or more antibiotics. The data indicated that antibiotic-resistant enterococci isolates were found in chicken whether it was organic or conventional. However, enterococci isolates that were resistant to antibiotics were less common in organic chicken (31.0%) when compared with those isolated from conventional chicken (43.6%). The results of this study suggest that raw retail organic and conventional chickens could be a source of antibiotic-resistant enterococci.
TI  - Detection of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis ST6-vanB2 and E. faecium  ST915-vanA in faecal samples of wild Rattus rattus in Spain.
AB  - The detection of vancomycin-resistant-enterococci (VRE) among wild animals represents a worrisome public health concern. The objectives of the study were to determine the possible presence of VRE in faecal samples of wild small mammals in Spain, to characterize the vancomycin resistance mechanisms and genetic lineages of recovered isolates and to know the diversity of enterococcal species in these animals. A total of 155 faecal samples from small mammals were inoculated in Slanetz-Bartley agar supplemented or not with vancomycin (Van-SB/SB plates). The antimicrobial susceptibility profile to 12 antimicrobials and the presence of 20 antimicrobial resistance genes was analyzed. The structure of Tn1546 and the presence of gelE, cylA, asa, esp and hyl genes was studied. Multilocus-sequence-typing (MLST) technique was also performed. VRE isolates were recovered in Van-SB plates in 11 samples. Two samples contained vanB2-positive E. faecalis isolates of lineage ST6, which showed a multiresistance phenotype and harboured the virulence genes gelE and asa. One sample contained a vancomycin-resistant E. faecium isolate of the new lineage ST915, with the vanA gene included into Tn1546 (truncated with IS1542 and IS1216 elements). The vanB2 and vanA isolates were obtained from Rattus rattus. The remaining eight VRE-positive samples contained species with intrinsic vancomycin-resistance mechanisms: E. casseliflavus (n=5) and E. gallinarum (n=3). One hundred and forty-seven vancomycin-susceptible-enterococcal isolates were obtained in SB plates, and E. faecalis and E. faecium were the most frequent detected species. This is the first report of vanB2-containing enterococci in wild animals.
TI  - Modified 16S-23S rRNA intergenic region restriction endonuclease analysis for species identification of Enterococcus strains isolated from pigs, compared with identification using classical methods and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
AB  - Fast and reliable identification of bacteria to at least the species level is currently the basis for correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment of infections. This is particularly important in the case of bacteria of the genus Enterococcus, whose resistance profile is often correlated with their species (e.g. resistance to vancomycin). In this study, we evaluated restriction endonuclease analysis of the 16S-23S rRNA gene intergenic transcribed spacer (ITS) region for species identification of Enterococcus. The utility of the method was compared with that of phenotypic methods [biochemical profile evaluation and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)]. Identification was based on 21 Enterococcus reference strains, of the species E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. hirae, E. durans, E. casseliflavus, E. gallinarum, E. avium, E. cecorum and E. columbae, and 47 Enterococcus field strains isolated from pigs. Restriction endonuclease analysis of the ITS-PCR product using HinfI, RsaI and MboI, in the order specified, enabled species differentiation of the Enterococcus reference and field strains, and in the case of the latter, the results of species identification were identical (47/47) to those obtained by MALDI-TOF MS. Moreover, as a result of digestion with MboI, a unique restriction profile was also obtained for the strains (3/3) identified by MALDI-TOF MS as E. thailandicus. In our opinion, restriction endonuclease analysis of the 16S-23S rRNA gene ITS region of Enterococcus may be a simple and relatively fast (less than 4 h) alternative method for identifying the species occurring most frequently in humans and animals.
TI  - Identification of Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis as vanC-type Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci (VRE) from sewage and river water in the provincial city of Miyazaki, Japan.
AB  - As a first step for assessing the risk to human health posed by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in the aquatic environment, we screened sewage and urban river water samples from Miyazaki, Japan for VRE. Because vancomycin-resistant organisms are not as prevalent in sewage and river water as vancomycin-susceptible organisms, the samples were screened by minimum inhibitory concentration test using the vancomycin-supplemented membrane-Enterococcus indoxyl-beta-d-glucoside (mEI) agar. The isolates, presumed to be enterococci, were identified using 16S rRNA sequencing analysis. The percentages of VRE isolates screened using 4 mug mL(-1) vancomycin-supplemented mEI agar from sewage and urban river water samples were 12% and 24%, respectively. The vancomycin-resistant genes vanC1 and vanC2/3 were detected in the isolates from both samples by PCR analysis. All enterococci isolates containing vanC1, which is a specific gene for vanC-type of VRE, were identified as Enterococcus casseliflavus/gallinarum. Further, 92% enterococci isolates containing vanC2/3 were identified as E. casseliflavus/gallinarum, the remaining isolates containing vanC2/3 were E. faecium (4%) and E. faecalis (4%). Thereafter, the distribution of E. faecium and E. faecalis, which are the major types of enterococci in humans containing vanC2/3, was observed in the water samples collected.
TI  - The first report of the vanC(1) gene in Enterococcus faecium isolated from a human clinical specimen.
AB  - The vanC(1) gene, which is chromosomally located, confers resistance to vancomycin and serves as a species marker for Enterococcus gallinarum. Enterococcus faecium TJ4031 was isolated from a blood culture and harbours the vanC(1)gene. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were performed to detect vanXYc and vanTc genes. Only the vanXYc gene was found in the E. faecium TJ4031 isolate. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of vancomycin and teicoplanin were 2 microg/mL and 1 microg/mL, respectively. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR results revealed that the vanC(1) and vanXYc genes were not expressed. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and southern hybridisation results showed that the vanC(1) gene was encoded in the chromosome. E. faecalis isolated from animals has been reported to harbour vanC(1)gene. However, this study is the first to report the presence of the vanC(1)gene in E. faecium of human origin. Additionally, our research showed the vanC(1)gene cannot serve as a species-specific gene of E. gallinarum and that it is able to be transferred between bacteria. Although the resistance marker is not expressed in the strain, our results showed that E. faecium could acquire the vanC(1)gene from different species.
TI  - The first report of the vanC1 gene in Enterococcus faecium isolated from a human  clinical specimen.
AB  - The vanC1 gene, which is chromosomally located, confers resistance to vancomycin  and serves as a species marker for Enterococcus gallinarum. Enterococcus faecium TJ4031 was isolated from a blood culture and harbours the vanC1gene. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were performed to detect vanXYc and vanTc genes. Only the vanXYc gene was found in the E. faecium TJ4031 isolate. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of vancomycin and teicoplanin were 2 microg/mL and 1 microg/mL, respectively. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR results revealed that the vanC1and vanXYc genes were not expressed. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and southern hybridisation results showed that the vanC1 gene was encoded in the chromosome. E. faecalis isolated from animals has been reported to harbour vanC1gene. However, this study is the first to report the presence of the vanC1gene in E. faecium of human origin. Additionally, our research showed the vanC1gene cannot serve as a species-specific gene of E. gallinarum and that it is able to be transferred between bacteria. Although the resistance marker is not expressed in the strain, our results showed that E. faecium could acquire the vanC1gene from different species.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococcal species isolated from antibiotic-treated dogs and cats.
AB  - In this study, we examined the antimicrobial susceptibility of the enterococci isolated from dogs and cats in Japan during 2011-2012. Fecal samples were collected from 84 dogs and 16 cats that underwent antibiotic treatment. Enterococci were detected in 70 of 84 dogs (83.3%) and 7 of 16 cats (43.8%). The most prevalent Enterococcus species was Enterococcus faecalis (64.9%); Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus durans were also isolated from 14 of 77 (18.2%) and 5 of 77 (6.5%) of these animals, respectively. The most active resistance was observed for erythromycin (44.2%) and oxytetracycline (44.2%), and there was considerable resistance to lincomycin (41.6%), gentamicin (31.2%) and kanamycin (31.2%). Compared with the results of a similar study conducted in 2006 and 2007, enterococci susceptibility to enrofloxacin and ampicillin had significantly increased. Enterococcus gallinarum harboring vanC1 and Enterococcus casseliflavus harboring vanC2/3 were isolated from 4 of 77 enterococcal isolates. However, no enterococcal isolates were resistant to vancomycin. Multidrug resistance was found for as few as two and as many as nine antimicrobials regardless of the class. These results demonstrate that dogs and cats treated with antibiotics are commonly colonized with antimicrobial-resistant enterococci.
TI  - High level aminoglycoside resistance and distribution of aminoglycoside resistant genes among clinical isolates of Enterococcus species in Chennai, India.
AB  - Enterococci are nosocomial pathogen with multiple-drug resistance by intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. Aminoglycosides along with cell wall inhibitors are given clinically for treating enterococcal infections. 178 enterococcal isolates were analyzed in this study. E. faecalis is identified to be the predominant Enterococcus species, along with E. faecium, E. avium, E. hirae, E. durans, E. dispar and E. gallinarum. High level aminoglycoside resistance (HLAR) by MIC for gentamicin (GM), streptomycin (SM) and both (GM + SM) antibiotics was found to be 42.7%, 29.8%, and 21.9%, respectively. Detection of aminoglycoside modifying enzyme encoding genes (AME) in enterococci was identified by multiplex PCR for aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia; aph(2'')-Ib; aph(2'')-Ic; aph(2'')-Id and aph(3')-IIIa genes. 38.2% isolates carried aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia gene and 40.4% isolates carried aph(3')-IIIa gene. aph(2'')-Ib; aph(2'')-Ic; aph(2'')-Id were not detected among our study isolates. aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia and aph(3')-IIIa genes were also observed in HLAR E. durans, E. avium, E. hirae, and E. gallinarum isolates. This indicates that high level aminoglycoside resistance genes are widely disseminated among isolates of enterococci from Chennai.
TI  - Enterococcal Disease, Epidemiology, and Implications for Treatment
AB  - During the past few decades, enterococci have emerged as important healthcare-associated pathogens (Arias & Murray, 2012; Austin, Bonten, Weinstein, Slaughter, & Anderson, 1999; Boyce, et al., 1994; Benenson, et al., 2009; Goossens, 1998; Handwerger, et al., 1993). The continuing progress of modern medical care toward more intensive and invasive medical therapies for human disease has undoubtedly contributed to the increased prevalence of these remarkable opportunistic pathogens. This trend has also been attributed to the increasing antibiotic resistance among clinical isolates of enterococci. The rapid spread of enterococci with resistance to vancomycin (VRE) has been of particular concern. Many healthcare-associated strains that are resistant to vancomycin also show resistance to penicillin, as well as high-level resistance (HLR) to aminoglycosides. Finally, as has historically been the case with enterococci, resistance is emerging to newer agents used to treat VRE infections, such as linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, and daptomycin (Chow, Donahedian, & Zervos, 1997; Herrero, Issa, & Patel, 2002; Sabol, Patterson, Lewis II, Aaron, Cadena, & Jorgensen, 2005). Over the past two decades, Enterococcus faecium has emerged as a leading cause of multidrug-resistant enterococcal infection in the United States (Hidron, et al., 2008). E. faecium is intrinsically more antibiotic-resistant than E. faecalis, with more than half of its pathogenic isolates expressing resistance to vancomycin, ampicillin, and high-levels of aminoglycosides. Treating infections caused by this species can be difficult, and the magnitude of the problem is vast. Approximately 40% of medical intensive care units in a recent National Healthcare Safety Network report found that the majority of device-associated infections (namely, infections due to central lines, urinary drainage catheters, and ventilators) were due to vancomycin- and ampicillin-resistant E. faecium (80% and 90.4%, respectively) (Hidron, et al., 2008). Although they were often resistant to high-level aminoglycosides and some macrolides, healthcare-associated infections in these units due to E. faecalis remained largely susceptible to vancomycin and ampicillin (93.1% and 96.2%, respectively) for reasons that are not entirely known. Other enterococcal species are rarer causes of human infection, including E. durans, E. avium, E. casseliflavus, E. hirae, E. gallinarum, E. raffinosus, and E. muntdii (Gordon, et al., 1992). In the following sections, the common human infections caused by enterococci are briefly described. The epidemiology of antibiotic-resistant enterococci in healthcare settings is summarized, including the role of colonization pressure and host factors on the emergence of VRE in clinical settings. Finally, the current challenges facing clinicians who treat antibiotic-resistant enterococcal infections are reviewed.
TI  - Drug-resistant and hospital-associated Enterococcus faecium from wastewater, riverine estuary and anthropogenically impacted marine catchment basin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enterococci, ubiquitous colonizers of humans and other animals, play  an increasingly important role in health-care associated infections (HAIs). It is believed that the recent evolution of two clinically relevant species, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium occurred in a big part in a hospital environment, leading to formation of high-risk enterococcal clonal complexes (HiRECCs), which combine multidrug resistance with increased pathogenicity and epidemicity. The aim of this study was to establish the species composition in wastewater, its marine recipient as well as a river estuary and to investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility of collected isolates. Molecular methods were additionally applied to test the presence of HiRRECC-related E. faecium. RESULTS: Two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), their marine outfalls and Vistula river that influence significantly the quality of waters in Gulf of Gdansk were sampled to investigate the presence of Enterococcus spp. Four-hundred-twenty-eight isolates were obtained, including E. faecium (244 isolates, 57.0%), E. hirae (113 isolates, 26.4%) and E. faecalis (63 isolates, 14.7%); other species (E. gallinarum/casseliflavus, E. durans and E. avium) accounted for 1.9%. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed the presence of isolates resistant to erythromycin, tetracycline, amipicillin, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides (high-level resistance), especially among E. faecium, where such isolates were usually characterized by multilocus sequence types associated with nosocomial lineages 17, 18 and 78 of this species representing HiRECC, formerly called CC17. These isolates not only carried several resistance determinants but were also enriched in genes encoding pathogenicity factors (Esp, pili) and genes associated with mobile genetic elements (MGE), a feature also typical for nosocomial HiRECC. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that WWTPs constitute an important source of enterococcal strains carrying antimicrobial resistance determinants, often associated with the presence of MGE, for the recipient water environment, thus increasing a pool of such genes for other organisms. The presence of HiRECCs in wastewaters and marine/river environment may indicate that adaptations gained in hospitals may be also beneficial for survival of such clones in other settings. There is an obvious need to monitor the release and spread of such strains in order to elucidate better ways to curb their dissemination.
TI  - Significance and survival of Enterococci during the house fly development.
AB  - House flies are among the most important nonbiting insect pests of medical and veterinary importance. Larvae develop in decaying organic substrates and their survival strictly depends on an active microbial community. House flies have been implicated in the ecology and transmission of enterococci, including multi-antibiotic-resistant and virulent strains of Enterococcus faecalis. In this study, eight American Type Culture Collection type strains of enterococci including Enterococcus avium, Enterococcus casseliflavus, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus mundtii, Enterococcus gallinarum, Enterococcusfaecalis, and Enterococcusfaecium were evaluated for their significance in the development of house flies from eggs to adults in bacterial feeding assays. Furthermore, the bacterial colonization of the gut of teneral flies as well as the importance of several virulence traits of E. faecalis in larval mortality was assessed. Overall survival of house flies (egg to adult) was significantly higher when grown with typically nonpathogenic enterococcal species such as E. hirae (76.0% survival), E. durans (64.0%), and E. avium (64.0%) compared with that with clinically important species E. faecalis (24.0%) and E. faecium (36.0%). However, no significant differences in survival of house fly larvae were detected when grown with E. faecalis strains carrying various virulence traits, including isogenic mutants of the human clinical isolate E. faecalis V583 with in-frame deletions of gelatinase, serine protease, and capsular polysaccharide serotype C. Enterococci were commonly detected in fly puparia (range: 75-100%; concentration: 103-105 CFU/puparium);however, the prevalence of enterococci in teneral flies varied greatly: from 25.0 (E. casseliflavus) to 89.5% (E. hirae). In conclusion, depending on the species, enterococci variably support house fly larval development and colonize the gut of teneral adults. The human pathogenic species, E. faecalis and E. faecium, poorly support larval development and are likely acquired in nature by adult flies during feeding. House fly larvae do not appear to be a suitable model organism for assessment of enterococcal virulence traits.
TI  - vanA-containing E. faecium isolates of clonal complex CC17 in clinical and environmental samples in a Tunisian hospital.
AB  - Twenty-eight vancomycin (VA)-resistant enterococci isolated from different patients (n = 16) and also from the environment (n = 12) were recovered in a Tunisian military hospital during 2012-2013. The mechanisms of resistance to VA and to other antibiotics as well as the presence of esp and hyl virulence genes were determined in these isolates by PCR, being their clonal relationship analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). VA resistance mechanisms detected were as follows (species-patient/environment): vanA (Enterococcus faecium, 13/5), vanC1 (Enterococcus gallinarum, 3/0), and vanC2 (Enterococcus casseliflavus, 0/7). Most of the VA-resistant enterococci presented a multiresistance phenotype and harbored different resistance genes (erm(B), tet(M), tet(L), ant(6)-Ia, aac(6')-aph(2"), aph(3')-IIIa, and catA). The PFGE revealed the presence of 3 clones (A, B, C) and 1 closely related pattern (A1) among the 13 vanA-containing E. faecium isolates of patients showing 11 of them the A-A1 patterns. The clone A was also detected in all 5 environmental vanA-containing E. faecium isolates. Strains did not contain esp or hyl virulence genes. Multilocus sequence typing was performed in 4 E. faecium isolates representative of the 4 detected pulsotypes (A, A1, B, and C), and 2 different sequence types were identified (ST18 and ST80), both of them included in clonal complex CC17. These strains contained the IS16 element and showed ampicillin and ciprofloxacin resistance. VA resistance could be an emerging problem in Tunisia, and this is one of the first cases described so far in this country.
TI  - Incidence of virulence factors in enterococci from raw and fermented meat and biofilm forming capacity at 25 degrees C and 37 degrees C.
AB  - Twenty-nine Enterococcus strains from raw and fermented meat products were screened for the presence of virulence genes, including those for aggregation substances (asa1 and asa373), cytolysin activator (cylA), collagen binding protein (ace), endocarditis antigen (efaA), enterococcal surface protein (esp) and gelatinase (gelE). Virulence gene occurrence, expression of gelatinase and pheromone aggregation was greater in Enterococcus faecalis than in Enterococcus faecium strains. All E. faecalis and 54% of E. faecium were positive for at least one or more virulence gene. The only strain of Enterococcus gallinarum tested also contained virulence genes. The effect of different growth temperatures (25 and 37 degrees C) on biofilm formation using polystyrene plates was also assessed. Strong biofilm formation occurred at lower than optimum temperature in all three species of enterococci. Neither esp nor gelE was necessary for biofilm formation and this relationship was species rather than strain specific. This study emphasizes the importance of enterococci as a reservoir of virulence genes and the potential for their genetic transfer to human strains following consumption of uncooked or undercooked contaminated meat.
TI  - Genetic characterization of antibiotic resistance and virulence factors in Enterococcus spp. from Japanese retail ready-to-eat raw fish.
AB  - Little information is available on the diversity and distribution of resistance and virulence factors in enterococci isolated from retail fish. In this study, 200 samples of retail ready-to-eat raw fish (sashimi) collected from the Japanese prefecture of Hiroshima were analyzed for incidence of Enterococcus spp. We recovered 96 enterococcal isolates from 90 (45%, 90/200) samples. Fifty-six strains were identified at the species level: E. faecalis (n = 31), E. faecium (n = 7), E. casseliflavus (n = 7), E. gallinarum (n = 3), E. phoeniculicola (n = 4), E. raffinosus (n = 2), E. saccharolyticus (n = 1), and E. gilvus (n = 1). Twenty-five (26%, 25/96) strains carried antibiotic resistance genes. These included the tet(M), tet(L), tet(K), erm(B), msr(A/B), aph(3'), and blaZ genes, which were detected in 12.5%, 9.3%, 2%, 14.5%, 1%, 1%, and 2% of isolates, respectively. The virulence genes gelE and asa1 were detected in 31 and 24 E. faecalis strains, respectively. Both genes were detected in one E. faecium strain. In conclusion, this is the first study to underscore the importance of sashimi as not only a reservoir of Enterococcus spp. carrying resistance and virulence genes, but also a reservoir for unusual Enterococcus spp.
TI  - Vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  - Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) consist mainly of Enterococcus faecalis and E faecium, the latter mostly hospital-acquired. In addition, E gallinarum and E casseliflavus are intrinsically vancomycin-resistant and are community-acquired. VRE have become common in many hospitals throughout the world and, once established, are very difficult to eradicate. VRE are difficult to treat; therefore, infection control measures in hospitals are of prime importance in preventing the establishment of these pathogens. Most severe VRE infections will need combination therapy because many of the effective antimicrobial agents, when used alone, have only a bacteriostatic effect.
TI  - Microbiological quality of ready-to-eat salads: an underestimated vehicle of bacteria and clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes.
AB  - The increase demand for fresh vegetables is causing an expansion of the market for minimally processed vegetables along with new recognized food safety problems. To gain further insight on this topic we analyzed the microbiological quality of Portuguese ready-to-eat salads (RTS) and their role in the spread of bacteria carrying acquired antibiotic resistance genes, food products scarcely considered in surveillance studies. A total of 50 RTS (7 brands; split or mixed leaves, carrot, corn) were collected in 5 national supermarket chains in Porto region (2010). They were tested for aerobic mesophilic counts, coliforms and Escherichia coli counts as well as for the presence of Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes. Samples were also plated in different selective media with/without antibiotics before and after enrichment. The E. coli, other coliforms and Enterococcus recovered were characterized for antibiotic resistance profiles and clonality with phenotypic and genetic approaches. A high number of RTS presented poor microbiological quality (86%--aerobic mesophilic counts, 74%--coliforms, 4%--E. coli), despite the absence of screened pathogens. In addition, a high diversity of bacteria (species and clones) and antibiotic resistance backgrounds (phenotypes and genotypes) were observed, mostly with enrichment and antibiotic selective media. E. coli was detected in 13 samples (n=78; all types and 4 brands; phylogenetic groups A, B1 and D; none STEC) with resistance to tetracycline [72%; tet(A) and/or tet(B)], streptomycin (58%; aadA and/or strA-strB), sulfamethoxazole (50%; sul1 and/or sul2), trimethoprim (50%; dfrA1 or dfrA12), ampicillin (49%; blaTEM), nalidixic acid (36%), ciprofloxacin (5%) or chloramphenicol (3%; catA). E. coli clones, including the widespread group D/ST69, were detected in different samples from the same brand or different brands pointing out to a potential cross-contamination. Other clinically relevant resistance genes were detected in 2 Raoultella terrigena carrying a bla(SHV-2) and 1 Citrobacter freundii isolate with a qnrB9 gene. Among Enterococcus (n=108; 35 samples; Enterococcus casseliflavus--40, Enterococcus faecalis--20, Enterococcus faecium--18, Enterococcus hirae--9, Enterococcus gallinarum--5, and Enterococcus spp.--16) resistance was detected for tetracyclines [6%; tet(M) and/or tet(L)], erythromycin [3%; erm(B)], nitrofurantoin (1%) or ciprofloxacin (1%). The present study places ready-to-eat salads within the spectrum of ecological niches that may be vehicles for antibiotic resistance bacteria/genes with clinical interest (e.g. E. coli-D-ST69; bla(SHV-2)) and these findings are worthy of attention as their spread to humans by ingestion cannot be dismissed.
TI  - Diversity, distribution and antibiotic resistance of Enterococcus spp. recovered  from tomatoes, leaves, water and soil on U.S. Mid-Atlantic farms.
AB  - Antibiotic-resistant enterococci are important opportunistic pathogens and have been recovered from retail tomatoes. However, it is unclear where and how tomatoes are contaminated along the farm-to-fork continuum. Specifically, the degree of pre-harvest contamination with enterococci is unknown. We evaluated the prevalence, diversity and antimicrobial susceptibilities of enterococci collected from tomato farms in the Mid-Atlantic United States. Tomatoes, leaves, groundwater, pond water, irrigation ditch water, and soil were sampled and tested for enterococci using standard methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the Sensititre microbroth dilution system. Enterococcus faecalis isolates were characterized using amplified fragment length polymorphism to assess dispersal potential. Enterococci (n = 307) occurred in all habitats and colonization of tomatoes was common. Seven species were identified: Enterococcus casseliflavus, E. faecalis, Enterococcus gallinarum, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avis, Enterococcus hirae and Enterococcus raffinosus. E. casseliflavus predominated in soil and on tomatoes and leaves, and E. faecalis predominated in pond water. On plants, distance from the ground influenced presence of enterococci. E. faecalis from samples within a farm were more closely related than those from samples between farms. Resistance to rifampicin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin was prevalent. Consumption of raw tomatoes as a potential exposure risk for antibiotic-resistant Enterococcus spp. deserves further attention.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of Enterococcus species from meat and fermented meat products isolated by a PCR-based rapid screening method.
AB  - Enterococci are predominantly found in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals, but species commonly resident on vegetation are known. Their presence in large numbers in foods may indicate a lapse in sanitation and their ability to serve as a genetic reservoir of transferable antibiotic resistance is of concern. Conventional culture methods for identification of enterococci are slow and sometimes give false results because of the biochemical diversity of the organisms in this genus. This work reports the development of a PCR-based assay to detect enterococci at the genus level by targeting a 16S rRNA sequence. Published 16S rRNA sequences were aligned and used to design genus specific primers (EntF and EntR). The primers were able to amplify a 678 bp target region from Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 7080 and 20 other strains of enterococci from 11 different species, but there was no amplification by 32 species from closely related genera (Pediococcus, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus and Listeria) or species of Escherichia coli and Salmonella. The PCR positive samples were plated, screened by a colony patch technique and their identities were confirmed by API 20 Strep panels and sequencing. When dry fermented sausage and ham as well as fresh meat batter for dry cured sausage manufacture were tested for enterococci by the method, 29 Enterococcus strains (15 E. faecalis, 13 E. faecium, and one E. gallinarum) were identified. When susceptibility of these enterococci to 12 antibiotics was tested, the highest incidence of resistance was to clindamycin (89.6%), followed by tetracycline hydrochloride (65.5%), tylosin (62%), erythromycin (45%), streptomycin and neomycin (17%), chloramphenicol (10.3%), penicillin (10.3%), ciprofloxacin (10.3%) and gentamicin (3.4%). None was resistant to the clinically important drugs vancomycin or ampicillin. Most strains (27/29) were resistant to more than one antibiotic while 17 of 29 strains were resistant to three to 8 antibiotics. The molecular method developed was validated for speciation of enterococci and was useful in assessing uncooked processed meat products as a reservoir for multi-drug resistant Enterococcus species.
TI  - The effects of bee pollen extracts on the broiler chicken's gastrointestinal microflora.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bee pollen ethanolic extracts on the in vivo gastrointestinal tract microflora colonization of broiler chickens. A completely randomized experiment based on six treatments (different concentrations of bee pollen - 0, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 45 g kg(-1) diet) was used during 7 weeks. The highest count of faecal Enterococci was found in the experimental group with the addition of 15 g of pollen (8.85 +/- 0.87 log CFU g(-1)) per 1 kg of feed mixture. The highest count of Lactobacilli was detected in the experimental group with 35 g of pollen per 1 kg of feed mixture and the highest number of the Enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in the control group (8.43 +/- 0.15 log CFU g(-1)). Moreover, the MALDI TOF MS Biotyper identified the following genera: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, as well as Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. crispatus, L. fermentum and L. salivarius from the Lactobacilli group and Enterococcus avium, E. casseliflavus, E. cecorum, E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. gallinarum, E. hirae and E. malodoratus from the Enterococci group. Additionally, the in vitro antimicrobial activities of pollen against five bacteria species isolated from gastrointestinal tracts of chickens were tested. The best antimicrobial effect of the pollen extract was detected against K. oxytoca.
TI  - Echinoderms from Azores islands: an unexpected source of antibiotic resistant Enterococcus spp. and Escherichia coli isolates.
AB  - The prevalence of antibiotic resistance and the implicated mechanisms of resistance were evaluated in Enterococcus spp. and Escherichia coli, isolated from a total of 250 faecal samples of echinoderms collected from Azorean waters (Portugal). A total of 144 enterococci (120 Enterococcus faecium, 14 E. hirae, 8 E. faecalis, 2 E. gallinarum) and 10 E. coli were recovered. High percentages of resistance in enterococci were found for erythromycin, ampicillin, tetracyclin and ciprofloxacin. The erm(A) or erm(B), tet(M) and/or tet(L), vat(D), aac(6')-aph(2'') and aph(3')-IIIa genes were found in isolates resistant to erythromycin, tetracycline, quinupristin/dalfopristin, high-level gentamicin and high-level kanamycin, respectively. Resistance in E. coli isolates was detected for streptomycin, amikacin, tetracycline and tobramycin. The aadA gene was found in streptomycin-resistant isolates and tet(A)+tet(B) genes in tetracycline-resistant isolates. The data recovered are essential to improve knowledge about the dissemination of resistant strains through marine ecosystems and the possible implications involved in transferring these resistances either to other animals or to humans.
TI  - Environmental contamination by dog&#8217;s faeces: a public health problem?
AB  - The risk to public health from the large number of dog stools present on streets  of urban areas is cause for concern. Dog faeces may be a serious hazard because they may contain microorganisms that are both pathogenic to humans and resistant to several classes of antibiotics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential for zoonotic infections and for the presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in canine faeces which contaminates the urban environment. A total of 418 canine faecal samples were collected from streets in seven areas of Bari, Southern Italy. We have isolated multi-drug resistant Enterococci and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from these dog faecal samples. The presence of the resistant bacteria in an urban environment may represent a public health hazard which requires control measures by competent authorities. No Salmonella, Yersinia or Campylobacter species were isolated. Giardia cysts were detected in 1.9% of the samples. The predominant Enterococcus species were E. faecium (61.6%), E. gallinarum (23.3%) and E. casseliflavus (5.5%). Other species, including E. faecalis were also isolated. These strains were resistant to clindamycin (86.3%), tetracycline (65.7%), erythromycin (60.27%) and ampicillin (47.9%). High-level aminoglycoside resistance (HLAR) was found in 65.7% of enterococci. Resistance to three or more antibiotics and six or more antibiotics were observed in 67.12% and 38.4% of Enterococcus spp., respectively. Resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin was not detected in any of the Enterococcus spp. isolated. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 0.7% of the faecal samples. Canine faeces left on the streets may represent a risk factor for transmission of microorganisms and a reservoir of multidrug- resistant bacteria thus contributing to the spread of resistance genes into an urban area.
TI  - The effect of glyphosate on potential pathogens and beneficial members of poultry microbiota in vitro.
AB  - The use of glyphosate modifies the environment which stresses the living microorganisms. The aim of the present study was to determine the real impact of glyphosate on potential pathogens and beneficial members of poultry microbiota in vitro. The presented results evidence that the highly pathogenic bacteria as Salmonella Entritidis, Salmonella Gallinarum, Salmonella Typhimurium, Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium botulinum are highly resistant to glyphosate. However, most of beneficial bacteria as Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus badius, Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Lactobacillus spp. were found to be moderate to highly susceptible. Also Campylobacter spp. were found to be susceptible to glyphosate. A reduction of beneficial bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract microbiota by ingestion of glyphosate could disturb the normal gut bacterial community. Also, the toxicity of glyphosate to the most prevalent Enterococcus spp. could be a significant predisposing factor that is associated with the increase in C. botulinum-mediated diseases by suppressing the antagonistic effect of these bacteria on clostridia.
TI  - Analysis of bacterial diversity during the fermentation of inyu, a high-temperature fermented soy sauce, using nested PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and the plate count method.
AB  - The diversity of bacteria associated with the fermentation of inyu, also known as black soy sauce, was studied through the nested PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of samples collected from the fermentation stages of the inyu production process. The DGGE profiles targeted the bacterial 16S rDNA and revealed the presence of Citrobacter farmeri, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pantoea agglomerans, Salmonella enterica, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus sciuri and Weissella confusa. The bacterial compositions of 4 fermented samples were further elucidated using the plate count method. The bacteria isolated from the koji-making stage exhibited the highest diversity; Brachybacterium rhamnosum, E. hormaechei, K. pneumoniae, Kurthia gibsonii, Pantoea dispersa, Staphylococcus gallinarum, Staphylococcus kloosii and S. sciuri were identified. Koji collected during the preincubation stage presented the largest cell counts, and E. hormaechei, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae and Enterobacter pulveris were identified. In brine samples aged for 7 and 31 days, the majority of the bacteria isolated belonged to 4 Bacillus species, but 4 Staphylococcus species and Delftia tsuruhatensis were also detected. This study demonstrates the benefits of using a combined approach to obtain a more complete picture of microbial populations and provides useful information for the control or development of bacterial flora during inyu fermentation.
TI  - Vancomycin-resistant enterococci in rooks (Corvus frugilegus) wintering throughout Europe.
AB  - This study's aims were to assess the prevalence of, and to characterize, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) from rooks (Corvus frugilegus) wintering in Europe during 2010/2011. Faeces samples were cultivated selectively for VRE and characterized. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were used to examine epidemiologic relationships of vanA-containing VRE. The vanA-carrying VRE were tested in vitro for mobility of vancomycin resistance traits. VRE were found in 62 (6%) of 1073 rook samples. Enterococcal species diversity comprised Enterococcus gallinarum (48 isolates), followed by E. faecium (9) and E. faecalis (5). Eight VRE harboured the vanA and ermB genes. Seven vanA-carrying VRE originated from the Czech Republic and one from Germany. All vanA-carrying VRE were identified as E. faecium. Based on MLST analysis, six vanA-positive isolates were grouped as ST92 type, one isolate belonged to ST121, and the remaining one was described as a novel type ST671. Seven out of eight isolates were able to transfer the vancomycin resistance trait via filter mating with a transfer rate of 8.95 +/- 3.25 x 10(-7) transconjugants per donor. In conclusion, wintering rooks in some European countries may disseminate clinically important enterococci and pose a risk for environmental contamination.
TI  - Characterization and risk factors of vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) among animal-affiliated workers in Malaysia.
AB  - AIMS: This study determined the risk factors and characteristics of vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) among individuals working with animals in Malaysia. METHODS AND RESULTS: Targeted cross-sectional studies accompanied with laboratory analysis for the identification and characterization of resistance and virulence genes and with genotype of VRE were performed. VRE were detected in 9.4% (95% CI: 6.46-13.12) of the sampled populations. Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus gallinarum were isolated, and vanA was detected in 70% of the isolates. Enterococcus faecalis with vanB was obtained from one foreign poultry worker. At least one virulence gene was detected in >50% of Ent. faecium and Ent. faecalis isolates. The esp and gelE genes were common among Ent. faecium (58.3%) and Ent. faecalis (78%), respectively. The VRE species showed diverse RAPD profiles with some clustering of strains based on the individual's background. However, the risk factors found to be significantly associated with the prevalence of VRE were age (OR: 5.39, 95% CI: 1.98-14.61) and previous hospitalization (OR: 4.06, 95% CI: 1.33-12.35). CONCLUSION: VRE species isolated from individuals in this study have high level of vancomycin resistance, were genetically diverse and possessed the virulence traits. Age of individuals and history of hospitalization rather than occupational background determined VRE colonization. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides comprehensive findings on the epidemiological and molecular features of VRE among healthy individuals working with animals.
TI  - Screening fecal enterococci from Greek healthy infants for susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Enterococci are among the first lactic acid bacteria to colonize the neonatal gastrointestinal tract, but they are also characterized as significant nosocomial pathogens. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of antibiotic resistance in enterococci isolated from neonates' gut microbiota as well as the presence of genetic determinants encoding for certain antibiotic resistance traits. A total of 263 fecal samples derived from 97 infants were collected on day 4, 30, and 90 after delivery. Enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently identified species (54.6%) followed by E. faecium, while E. casseliflavus/E. flavescens and E. gallinarum were also traced. The isolates were examined for their resistance to 12 antibiotics. Rifampicin resistance was the highest observed (53.2%), followed by resistance to tetracycline (42.0%), erythromycin (35.7%), and vancomycin (11.2%). Multiresistant strains were highly prevalent. Only intrinsic vancomycin resistance (vanC1 and vanC2/C3) was traced. The ermB gene was detected in 49 out of 96 erythromycin-resistant isolates, while tet genes were detected in 51 out of 113 tetracycline-resistant strains, with tet(L) being the most frequently observed. In conclusion, antibiotic-resistant enterococci are already established in the fecal microbiota of healthy neonates, from the first days of an infant's life.
TI  - Evaluation of species-specific PCR, Bruker MS, VITEK MS and the VITEK 2 system for the identification of clinical Enterococcus isolates.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to compare the performance of species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and phenotypic identification systems for the identification of Enterococcus species. A total of 132 clinical isolates were investigated by the following: (1) a multiplex real-time PCR assay targeting ddl Enterococcus faecium, ddl Enterococcus faecalis, vanC1 and vanC2/C3 genes, and a high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis of the groESL gene for the differentiation of Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus gallinarum; (2) Bruker MS; (3) VITEK MS; and (4) the VITEK 2 system. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used as a reference method in the study. The 132 isolates were identified as 32 E. faecalis, 63 E. faecium, 16 E. casseliflavus and 21 E. gallinarum. The multiplex PCR, Bruker MS and VITEK MS were able to identify all the isolates correctly at the species level. The VITEK 2 system could identify 131/132 (99.2 %) and 121/132 (91.7 %) of the isolates at the genus and species levels, respectively. The HRM-groESL assay identified all (21/21) E. gallinarum isolates and 81.3 % (13/16) of the E. casseliflavus isolates. The PCR methods described in the present study are effective in identifying the enterococcal species. MALDI-TOF MS is a rapid, reliable and cost-effective identification technique for enterococci. The VITEK 2 system is less efficient at detecting non-faecalis and non-faecium Enterococcus species.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of propolis on the microbiota from gastrointestinal tract of chickens.
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the effect of propolis extracts on the microbial colonization of chicken gastrointestinal tract in vivo. The propolis was administered to both feed mixtures in various amounts except of the control group. The addition of 150 mg propolis to 1 kg of feed was included in the first experimental group, the addition of 450 mg.kg(-1) in the second experimental group, the addition of 600 mg.kg(-1) the third experimental group and 800 mg kg(-1) in the fourth one. The highest count of faecal enterococci was found in the third group (8.6 cfu.g(-1)) where 600 mg of propolis to 1 kg was added to the feed mixture. The highest count of lactobacilli was detected in the fourth experimental group (8.83 cfu.g(-1)) where was 800 mg of propolis added to 1 kg of feed mixture and number of Enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in control group (8.73 cfu.g(-1)). With RTQ PCR detected species from the genus Enterococcus were: E. avium, E. casseliflavus, E cecorum, E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. gallinarum, E. hirae and E. malodoratus and from genus Lactobacillus were: Lactobacillus crispatus, L. acidophilus and L. salivarius. With MALDI TOF MS Biotyper from Enterobacteriaceae genera were identified Citrobacter braakii, Raoultella ornithinolytica, Serratia fonticola, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella oxytoca. Antimicrobial activities In vitro of six species of bacteria isolated from gastrointestinal tract of chickens were also tested. The best antimicrobial effect of Citrobacter braakii on ethanolic propolis extract in all concentrations were found.
TI  - Diversity of clones and genotypes among vancomycin-resistant clinical Enterococcus isolates recovered in a Spanish hospital.
AB  - Forty-three vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) from different patients were recovered in a Spanish Hospital (2003-2010), representing 0.4% of the total of enterococci recovered. Mechanisms detected were vanA (five Enterococcus faecium, two E. faecalis), vanB2 (seven E. faecium, five E. faecalis), vanB1 (one E. faecalis), and vanC1/2 (22 E. gallinarum, 1 E. casseliflavus). Four different Tn1546 structures were found among the seven vanA strains, three of them with insertions (ISEf1 or IS1542) or deletions. Most of the VRE presented a multiresistance phenotype and harbored different resistance genes [erm(B), tet(M), tet(L), ant(6)-Ia, aac(6')-aph(2''), aph(3')-IIIa, and catA]. Sixteen unrelated pulsotypes were detected among the 20 vanA/vanB E. faecalis and E. faecium isolates by pulsed-field-gel-electrophoresis and 11 unrelated pulsotypes among the 22 E. gallinarum isolates. Six different sequence types (ST) were demonstrated among the 12 vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains (one of them new), and 5 were included into the clonal-complex (CC) CC17. Five different ST were detected among the eight E. faecalis strains. The esp gene was detected in 58% and 25% of E. faecium and E. faecalis strains, respectively, and the hyl gene in 78% and 89%, respectively. A high diversity of clones and genotypes of VRE were detected in this hospital.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology of Enterococcus sp. isolated in a university hospital in Algeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of enterococci isolated from infections at an Algerian university hospital, and to evaluate the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and the clonal cluster present in this country. METHODS: Patients who presented at Annaba University Hospital with Enterococcus infections were prospectively included over a 1-y period (2010). All Enterococcus sp. isolated were characterized by antibiotic resistance, van and erm genes, repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR), multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), and virulence genes. RESULTS: A total of 125 Enterococcus isolates recovered from 125 patients (59% female; median age 54 y, range 2-86 y) were studied. No differences in epidemiological data were observed between infections by Enterococcus faecalis vs Enterococcus faecium. However a high proportion of E. faecium were resistant to ampicillin (95%). The prevalence of VRE, corresponding to 4 vanC1-Enterococcus gallinarum, was 3.2%. A high level of genomic diversity among strains was noted, with the importance of sequence type (ST) 78 (which belongs to clonal complex (CC) 17) in E. faecium and ST317 and CC2 in E. faecalis. CONCLUSIONS: This first study on enterococci isolated in Algeria shows the low prevalence of VRE, but the presence of clonal complexes linked to VRE and vancomycin-sensitive enterococci associated with hospital infections. Moreover the high level of macrolide resistance and/or ampicillin resistance in E. faecium suggests close monitoring of the epidemiology of these strains.
TI  - Antibiotic-resistant enterococci in seawater and sediments from a coastal fish farm.
AB  - The aim of this study was to detect and characterize antibiotic-resistant enterococci in seawater and sediment from a Mediterranean aquaculture site where no antibiotics are used. Colonies (650) grown on Slanetz-Bartley (SB) agar were amplified on antibiotic-supplemented SB, and erythromycin (ERY), tetracycline (TET), and ampicillin (AMP) MICs were determined. Of 75 resistant isolates (17 to TET, 5 to ERY, and 45 to AMP), 5 Enterococcus faecalis, 25 E. faecium, 5 E. casseliflavus, 1 E. gallinarum, 1 E. durans, and 23 Enterococcus spp. were identified by genus- and species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). tet(M), tet(O), tet(L), tet(K), erm(B), erm(A), erm(C), mef, msr, blaZ, and int(Tn916) were sought by PCR, including an improved multiplex PCR assay targeting tet(M), tet(L), and erm(B). Tet(M) was the most frequent TET resistance gene; msr(C) was the sole ERY resistance gene detected. blaZ was found in 29/45 AMP-resistant isolates; however, no beta-lactamase production was detected. Antibiotic-resistant enterococci were recovered 2 km off the coast despite the absence of selective pressure exerted by antibiotic use. The occurrence of resistant strains in the absence of the tested genes may indicate the presence of less common resistance determinants. This first evidence of resistant enterococci at a Mediterranean aquaculture site suggests the existence of a marine reservoir of antibiotic resistances potentially transmissible to virulent strains that could be affected by mariculture in an antibiotic-independent manner.
TI  - Presence of the resistance genes vanC1 and pbp5 in phenotypically vancomycin and  ampicillin susceptible Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Ampicillin and vancomycin are important antibiotics for the therapy of Enterococcus faecalis infections. The ampicillin resistance gene pbp5 is intrinsic in Enterococcus faecium. The vanC1 gene confers resistance to vancomycin and serves as a species marker for Enterococcus gallinarum. Both genes are chromosomally located. Resistance to ampicillin and vancomycin was determined in 484 E. faecalis of human and porcine origin by microdilution. Since E. faecalis are highly skilled to acquire resistance genes, all strains were investigated for the presence of pbp5 (and, in positive strains, for the penicillin-binding protein synthesis repressor gene psr) and vanC1 (and, in positive strains, for vanXYc and vanT) by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). One porcine and one human isolate were phenotypically resistant to ampicillin; no strain was vancomycin resistant. Four E. faecalis (3/1 of porcine/human origin) carried pbp5 (MIC=1 mg/L), and four porcine strains were vanC1 positive (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC]=1 mg/L). Real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR revealed that the genes were not expressed. The psr gene was absent in the four pbp5-positive strains; the vanXYc gene was absent in the four vanC1-positive strains. However, vanT of the vanC gene cluster was detected in two vanC1-positive strains. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the presence of pbp5, identical with the "E. faecium pbp5 gene," and of vanC1/vanT in E. faecalis. Even if resistance is not expressed in these strains, this study shows that E. faecalis have a strong ability to acquire resistance genes-and potentially to spread them to other bacteria. Therefore, close monitoring of this species should be continued.
TI  - Prevalence and antimicrobial resistance pattern of multidrug-resistant enterococci isolated from clinical specimens.
AB  - PURPOSE: Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) pose an emerging problem in hospitals worldwide. The present study was undertaken to determine the occurrence, species prevalence, antibacterial resistance, and phenotypic and genetic characteristics of VRE isolated in Riyadh hospitals, KSA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred and six isolates of enterococcal species were obtained from clinical samples. The antibiotic susceptibility of isolates and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) tests for vancomycin and teicoplanin were determined. Molecular typing of VRE isolates was carried out by using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and the resistance genotype was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: VRE accounted for 3.9% of the isolates and were detected mostly in urine, wound and blood specimens isolated from ICU, internal medicine and surgical wards. All strains were identified to species level and were found to consist of E. faecalis (69.2%), E. faecium (11.3%), E. avium (2.1%), E. hirae (0.8%), E. casseliflavus (1.3%) and E. gallinarum (1.3%) species. According to the susceptibility data obtained, 8 (3.9%) out of 206 isolates were found to be VRE (MICs > 32 mug/ml). The vanA, vanB and vanC gene fragments of E. faecalis, E. faecium and E. gallinarum were amplified from isolates and were detected. PFGE patterns of the VRE isolates revealed homogenous patterns with dominant clone suggesting that the strains intrinsic resistance is independent. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows an emergence of VRE along with increased rate of multidrug-resistant enterococci in the area of the study. Regular surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities should be done regularly and the risk factors should be determined.
TI  - Comparative genomics of enterococci: variation in Enterococcus faecalis, clade structure in E. faecium, and defining characteristics of E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus.
AB  - The enterococci are Gram-positive lactic acid bacteria that inhabit the gastrointestinal tracts of diverse hosts. However, Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis have emerged as leading causes of multidrug-resistant hospital-acquired infections. The mechanism by which a well-adapted commensal evolved into a hospital pathogen is poorly understood. In this study, we examined high-quality draft genome data for evidence of key events in the evolution of the leading causes of enterococcal infections, including E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. casseliflavus, and E. gallinarum. We characterized two clades within what is currently classified as E. faecium and identified traits characteristic of each, including variation in operons for cell wall carbohydrate and putative capsule biosynthesis. We examined the extent of recombination between the two E. faecium clades and identified two strains with mosaic genomes. We determined the underlying genetics for the defining characteristics of the motile enterococci E. casseliflavus and E. gallinarum. Further, we identified species-specific traits that could be used to advance the detection of medically relevant enterococci and their identification to the species level.
TI  - Bacteriophage lysis of Enterococcus host strains: a tool for microbial source tracking?
AB  - This paper describes the isolation of Enterococcus host strains, for potential use as simple bacteriophage (phage)-based microbial source tracking (MST) tools. Presumptive Enterococcus host strains were isolated from cattle feces, raw municipal wastewater, agricultural runoff, and waters impacted by farms or wastewater treatment works (WWTW) in southern England, United Kingdom (UK). All enterococcal host strains (n = 390) were first screened for their ability to detect phage in samples of raw municipal wastewater and fecal material from cattle, pigs, and sheep. Host strains that detected phage (n = 147) were ranked according to both their specificity to a particular fecal source and also the number of phages (expressed as plaque-forming units, PFU) that they detected per milliliter of sample. Host strains that demonstrated host specificity and which detected phages at levels greater than 100 PFU/mL (n = 29) were further tested using additional fecal samples of human and nonhuman origin. The specificity and sensitivity of the enterococcal host strains were found to vary, ranging from 44 to 100% and from 17 to 83%, respectively. Most notably, seven strains exhibited 100% specificity to either cattle, human, or pig samples. Isolates exhibiting specificity to cattle were identified as belonging to the species Enterococcus casseliflavus , Enterococcus mundtii , or Enterococcus gallinarum , while human and pig isolates were members of either Enterococcus faecium or Enterococcus faecalis . The high specificity of phages infecting Enterococcus hosts and the simplicity and relatively low cost of the approach collectively indicate a strong potential for using this method as a tool in MST.
TI  - Detection of vancomycin-resistant enterococci from faecal samples of Iberian wolf and Iberian lynx, including Enterococcus faecium strains of CC17 and the new singleton ST573.
AB  - The aim of this study was to perform the molecular characterization of vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) within the faecal flora of Iberian wolf and Iberian lynx. The association with other resistance genes and the detection of virulence genes were also analysed. From 2008 to 2010, 365 faecal samples from Iberian wolf and Iberian lynx were collected and tested for VRE recovery. Mechanisms of resistance to vancomycin and other antibiotics, as well as genes encoding virulence factors were detected through PCR. Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) was performed for Enterococcus faecium strains. VRE were recovered in 8 of the 365 analysed samples. The vanA gene was identified in two E. faecium isolates recovered from Iberian wolf faecal samples and the remaining six showed intrinsic resistance (3 vanC1-E. gallinarum and 3 vanC2-E. casseliflavus, from Iberian wolf and Iberian lynx faecal samples, respectively). One vanA-containing isolate showed tetracycline and erythromycin resistance [with erm(B) and tet(L) genes] and the other one also exhibited ampicillin and kanamycin resistance [with erm(B), tet(M) and aph(3')-III genes]. One of the vanA-isolates revealed a new sequence type named ST573 and the other one belonged to the CC17 clonal complex (ST18). The hyl gene was detected in one E. casseliflavus and three E. gallinarum but not among vanA-positive isolates, and the occurrence of cylA and cylL genes was confirmed in two E. casseliflavus isolates. A low prevalence of VRE has been detected in faecal samples of Iberian wolf and Iberian lynx and strains with an acquired mechanism of resistance to vancomycin have not been detected among Iberian lynx.
TI  - [The relationship between antibiotic resistance and virulence factors in urinary  Enterococcus isolates].
AB  - Increasing multidrug resistance in nosocomial Enterococcus strains from all over  the world recently enhances the need for further investigation of enterococci, especially their virulence factors. There are still many lacking parts about virulence factors of clinical enterococcus isolates. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the antibiotic resistance and the presence of potential virulence factors of 91 Enterococcus strains (59 E.faecalis, 31 E.faecium and 1 E.gallinarum) isolated from urine cultures of inpatients between January 2008-June 2010 in our hospital and also to evaluate whether a correlation existed between antibiotic resistance and potential virulence factors. The genes which encoded virulence factors of enterococci; aggregation substance (AS), enterococcal surface protein (ESP) and hyaluronidase (HYL) (asa1, esp, hyl respectively) were studied by molecular methods and haemolysin production and gelatinase activity were studied by phenotypic methods. Vancomycin resistant strains were checked for the presence of vanA and vanB genes. Eight (25.8%) E.faecium isolates were found glycopeptide resistant. In seven of these isolates resistance type was vanA and in one it was neither vanA nor vanB. High-level gentamicin and high-level streptomycin resistance rates were 74.2% and 61.3% in E.faecium strains and were 22% ve 27.1% in E.faecalis strains, respectively. Beta-lactamase production and linezolid resistance were not detected in any of the strains. E.faecium isolates were more resistant (p< 0.001-0.013) than E.faecalis isolates to all tested antibiotics except tetracycline, minocycline, doxycycline and streptogramin (p< 0.001). hyl gene positivity (p< 0.001) was found higher in E.faecium isolates whereas esp (p= 0.003) and asa1 (p< 0.001) gene positivity, haemolysin production (p=0.014) and gelatinase activity (p= 0.029) were higher in E.faecalis isolates. AS and ESP were the most frequent virulence factors, with the rates of 26.7% and 25.6%, respectively. There were 32 (35.6%) strains without any of the investigated virulence factors. We have also detected that asa1 gene positive E.faecalis isolates were more resistant to ciprofloxacin (p= 0.001), norfloxacin (p= 0.006) and levofloxacin (p= 0.001) than asa1 gene negative isolates; esp gene positive E.faecalis isolates were more resistant to doxycycline (p= 0.043) than esp gene negative isolates and hyl gene positive E.faecium isolates were more resistant to nitrofurantoine (p= 0.011) than hyl gene negative isolates. This was the first clinical sample originated study, investigating the corelation between antibiotic resistance and virulence factors in urinary Enterococcus isolates in Turkey.
TI  - Molecular characterization of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-containing Escherichia coli isolates in wild birds from the Azores Archipelago.
AB  - To study the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-containing Escherichia coli isolates, and the mechanisms of resistance implicated, 220 faecal samples from wild birds were collected between 2006 and 2010 in the Azores Archipelago. Samples were spread on Slanetz-Bartley agar plates supplemented with 4 mg/l vancomycin and on Levine agar plates supplemented with 2 mg/l cefotaxime for VRE and ESBL-containing E. coli isolation, respectively. vanA-containing enterococcal isolates (four Enterococcus faecium and two Enterococcus durans) and vanC-1 Enterococcus gallinarum isolates were detected in six and seven faecal samples, respectively. VRE isolates showed ampicillin (n=11), ciprofloxacin (n=9), tetracycline (n=6), erythromycin (n=5), quinupristin/dalfopristin (n=3) and high-level kanamycin resistance (n=1). The tet(L) and/or tet(M) gene was found in all tetracycline-resistant isolates and the erm(B) gene in all erythromycin-resistant isolates. Three vanA-containing E. faecium and two E. gallinarum presented specific sequences of the Tn5397 transposon. Four VRE isolates harboured the ace virulence gene. One faecal sample revealed one ESBL-containing E. coli isolate that belongs to the A phylogenetic group, showed a phenotype of resistance to beta-lactams and tetracycline, and harboured the bla (CTX-M-14), bla (SHV-12) and the tet(A) genes. To our knowledge, this is the first study to focus on defining the prevalence of VRE and/or ESBL-containing E. coli strains in wild birds from the Azores. The data recovered are essential to improve knowledge about the dissemination of resistant strains through wild ecosystems and their possible implications by transferring these resistances to other animals or to humans.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in faecal microbiota of Greek healthy infants.
AB  - Increasing use of antibiotics for the treatment of infectious diseases and also for non-therapeutic reasons (agriculture, animal husbandry and aquaculture) has led to the increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance and the ineffectiveness of antimicrobial treatment. Commensal intestinal bacteria are very often exposed to the selective pressure of antimicrobial agents and may constitute a reservoir of antibiotic resistance determinants that can be transferred to pathogens. The present study aimed to investigate the antibiotic susceptibility profile and the presence of selected resistance genes in cocci isolated from the faecal microbiota of 35 healthy, full-term infants at 4, 30 and 90 days after delivery. A total of 148 gram-positive, catalase-negative cocci were isolated and tested for susceptibility to 12 different antibiotics by disk-diffusion technique. Multiplex PCR analysis was performed for the identification of Enterococcus spp. isolates and the simultaneous detection of vancomycin-resistance genes. PCR-based methodology was used also for identification of tetracycline and erythromycin resistance determinants. Identification results indicated E. faecalis as the predominant species (81 strains), followed by E. faecium, E. casseliflavus/E. flavescens and E. gallinarum. High prevalence of resistance to tetracycline (39.9%), erythromycin (35.1%), vancomycin (19.6%) and to nucleic acid synthesis inhibitors was detected. PCR data revealed 24 out of 52 erythromycin-resistant isolates carrying the ermB gene and 32 out of 59 tetracycline-resistant strains carrying tet genes, with tet(L) determinant being the most frequently detected. Only intrinsic vancomycin resistance (vanC1 and vanC2/C3) was reported among tested isolates. In conclusion, erythromycin and tetracycline acquired resistant traits are widespread among faecal cocci isolates from Greek, healthy infants under no apparent antimicrobial selective pressure.
TI  - First detection of the staphylococcal trimethoprim resistance gene dfrK and the dfrK-carrying transposon Tn559 in enterococci.
AB  - The trimethoprim resistance gene dfrK has been recently described in Staphylococcus aureus, but so far has not been found in other bacteria. A total of 166 enterococci of different species (E. faecium, E. faecalis, E. hirae, E. durans, E. gallinarum, and E. casseliflavus) and origins (food, clinical diseases in humans, healthy humans or animals, and sewage) were studied for their susceptibility to trimethoprim as determined by agar dilution (European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing) and the presence of (a) the dfrK gene and its genetic environment and (b) other dfr genes. The dfrK gene was detected in 49% of the enterococci (64% and 42% of isolates with minimum inhibitory concentrations of >/=2 mg/L or </=1 mg/L, respectively). The tet(L)-dfrK linkage was detected in 21% of dfrK-positive enterococci. The chromosomal location of the dfrK gene was identified in one E. faecium isolate in which the dfrK was not linked to tet(L) gene but was part of a Tn559 element, which was integrated in the chromosomal radC gene. This Tn559 element was also found in 14 additional isolates. All combinations of dfr genes were detected among the isolates tested (dfrK, dfrG, dfrF, dfrK+dfrG, dfrK+dfrF, dfrF+dfrG, and dfrF+dfrG+dfrK). The gene dfrK gene was found together with other dfr genes in 58% of the tested enterococci. This study suggested an exchange of the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrK between enterococci and staphylococci, as previously observed for the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrG.
TI  - Prevalence of vanC vancomycin-resistant enterococci in the teaching hospitals of  the University of Debrecen, Hungary.
AB  - Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are common nosocomial pathogens; however,  until now they have been rarely encountered in Hungary. In the present study, we investigated the prevalence of VRE in the teaching hospitals of the University of Debrecen. Of 7,271 Enterococcus-containing clinical samples collected between 2004 and 2009, we identified 16 VRE. Species-specific polymerase chain reaction was used to detect Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus casseliflavus, and Enterococcus gallinarum. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction was performed to identify the vancomycin resistance genes: vanA, vanB, vanC1/C2, vanD, vanE, and vanG. Restriction digestion with SalI and HindIII was introduced to differentiate the vanC1 and vanC2 genes from each other. Genetic relationships between the strains were investigated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Overall, we identified the vanC1 resistance gene in 14 E. gallinarum and the vanC2 resistance gene in two E. casseliflavus strains. Except for two samples, the isolates had different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis types, suggesting sporadic emergence of the resistant bacteria. In addition, antibiotic resistance profile was determined by E-test. Three E. gallinarum strains proved to be resistant to gentamicin because of the presence of the aacA-aphD gene. Although the prevalence of VRE in Debrecen is rather low, the appearance of multiple resistances is of concern.
TI  - Characterization of the mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance in vancomycin-resistant enterococci of different origins.
AB  - The mutations in gyrA and parC genes were analyzed in 22 vancomycin-resistant enterococci of different origins and species, which had varying susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (minimum inhibitory concentration, MIC: 0.5- >256 mg/l). All vanA or vanb2-containing strains with ciprofloxacin MIC of >32 mg/l presented amino acid changes in GyrA protein (S83I, S83Y, S83R or S83I-E87G) with/without changes in ParC protein (S80I or S80R or S80l). Strains with lower ciprofloxacin MICs presented the GyrA and parC wild type. One vanA-containing Enterococcus durans strain with a ciprofloxacin MIC of 64 mg/l presented the S83I and S80I changes in GyrA and ParC proteins, respectively. Two vanB2 Enterococcus faecium strains were typed by multi-locus-sequencetyping and both were ascribed to the CC17 clonal complex with two sequence-types (ST78 and ST17-like). All seven vancomycin-resistant and ciprofloxacin-resistant E. faecium strains showed ampicillin resistance (MIC 32-256 mg/l), identifying the following amino acid changes in PBP5 protein: Q461K, V462K, H470Q, M485A, N496K, A499T, E525D, N546T, A558T, G582S, K632Q, P642L, E629V and P667S, together with a serine insertion at position 466 . The 12 Enterococcus gallinarum and Enterococcus casseliflavus isolates included in the study exhibited an MIC for ciprofloxacin in the range 0.5-16 mg/l and no amino acid changes were identified in GyrA or ParC proteins. Specific mutations in gyrA and parC genes are associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in E. faecium and E. durans of different origins.
TI  - [Study of antibiotic resistance of enterococci strains received in 2009 in the National Reference Centre for Enterococci].
AB  - Enterococci are a frequent cause of a variety of human infections, the most common being urinary tract infection followed by bacteraemia, meningitis and endocarditis from hospitalized patients. OBJECTIVE: The study and monitoring of antibiotic resistance of enterococci strains isolated and confirmed in 2009. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Identification of 30 strains received in 2009 was based on phenotypic characteristics (microscopy, culture and biochemical characters); antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed according to CLSI standards 2009 by diffusion test and MIC by agar dilution and E-test. RESULT: The strains belonged to the following species: E. faecalis (18), E. faecium (6), E. gallinarum (5), and E. durans (1), and were isolated from: blood cultures, urine, pus-wound, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and catheter. Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed susceptibility to different antibiotics depending on the species and also on the type of clinical samples. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the small number of strains, no resistance phenotypes could be determined. As emergence of antibiotic resistant enterococci is well known, continuous surveillance of antibiotic susceptibility and molecular study of this issue are required.
TI  - Trafficking of methicillin-resistant staphylococci and co-colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the trafficking of methicillin-resistant staphylococci between the hospital and community as well as the occurrence of co-colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: From November 2005 to April 2006, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (MRCoNS)-positive patients at the Salmaniya Medical Complex, Bahrain were assessed for VRE co-colonization. Characterization of vancomycin resistance genotype by PCR was carried out. Close family contacts were screened for MRSA and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis of MRSA isolates from patient-family member pairs was conducted. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-two patients (93 MRSA; 89 MRCoNS) and 356 family members were enrolled. Seven MRSA and 41 MRCoNS strains were isolated from the family members. PFGE analysis revealed the presence of variants of a single MRSA clone among patients and their relatives. A total of 112 patients (62 MRSA; 50 MRCoNS) provided stool for VRE screening. Of these 13 stool specimens (11.6%) were VRE-positive. All the VRE isolates were from MRSA-positive patients, thus positivity rate among MRSA patients was 20.9% (n/N = 13/62). These were predominantly Enterococcus gallinarum with vanC1 genotype and one strain was Enterococcus faecium (vanB genotype). Two E. gallinarum isolates harbored an additional vanB gene. The majority of VRE isolates were from patients in medical and surgical units (n/N = 10/13; 77%). Male gender, prolonged hospitalization and presence of co-morbidities were significantly associated with MRSA/VRE co-colonization (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: MRSA/VRE co-colonization with MRSA trafficking between the hospital and community environment is a public health concern occurring in our setting.
TI  - Species distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococci isolated from broilers infected experimentally with Eimeria spp and fed with diets containing different supplements.
AB  - Resistant bacteria in animal can be spread to environment and to humans. Poultry  feed and infections caused by Eimeria spp. are important factors in determining the intestinal microbial communities. The aim of this study was to verify the prevalence of species and antimicrobial susceptibility of Enterococcus isolated from broilers fed with different supplements and infected experimentally with Eimeria spp. Broilers were divided in eight groups, fed with diets supplemented with a combination of antimicrobial, ionophore-coccidiostatics, probiotic, essential oil. At 14 days old all birds, except the control, received a solution containing oocysts of Eimeria spp. Samples of cloacal swabs from broilers were collected. A total of 240 Enterococcus sp. strains were isolated, confirmed genus by PCR, classified as species, tested for antimicrobial susceptibility and screened by PCR for the presence of tet(L), tet(M) and erm(B) genes. The overall distribution of species isolated from fecal samples was E. faecalis (40%), followed by E. casseliflavus/E. gallinarum (10.8%), E. mundtii (10.8%), E. faecium (10.8%), E. columbae (5.8%) and E. gallinarum (4.2%). Changes in the composition or frequency of Enterococcus species were observed in all dietary supplementation. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed resistance phenotypes a range of antibiotics, especially used in humans such as, streptomycin, penicillin, rifampicin and vancomycin. There was no correlation between different supplementation for broilers and antimicrobial resistance and the presence of tet(M), tet(L) and erm(B) genes. Dietary supplementation had effect on the Enterococcus sp. colonization, but did not have significant effect on the phenotype and genotype of antimicrobial resistance in enterococci.
TI  - Bacteriophage-mediated transduction of antibiotic resistance in enterococci.
AB  - AIMS: Temperate bacteriophages are bacterial viruses that transfer genetic information between bacteria. This phenomenon is known as transduction, and it is important in acquisition of bacterial virulence genes and antimicrobial resistance determinants. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the role of bacteriophages in gene transfer (antibiotic resistance) in enterococci. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three bacteriophages from environmental samples isolated on pig host strains of Enterococcus gallinarum and Enterococcus faecalis were evaluated in transduction experiments. Antibiotic resistance was transferred from Ent. gallinarum to Ent. faecalis (tetracycline resistance) and from Ent. faecalis to Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus hirae/durans and Enterococcus casseliflavus (gentamicin resistance). CONCLUSIONS: Bacteriophages play a role in transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants in enterococci. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study confirms previous suggestions on transduction in enterococci, in particular on interspecies transduction. Interspecies transduction is significant because it widens the range of recipients involved in antimicrobial resistance transfer.
TI  - Development of a DNA microarray for enterococcal species, virulence, and antibiotic resistance gene determinations among isolates from poultry.
AB  - A DNA microarray (Enteroarray) was designed with probes targeting four species-specific taxonomic identifiers to discriminate among 18 different enterococcal species, while other probes were designed to identify 18 virulence factors and 174 antibiotic resistance genes. In total, 262 genes were utilized for rapid species identification of enterococcal isolates, while characterizing their virulence potential through the simultaneous identification of endogenous antibiotic resistance and virulence genes. Enterococcal isolates from broiler chicken farms were initially identified by using the API 20 Strep system, and the results were compared to those obtained with the taxonomic genes atpA, recA, pheS, and ddl represented on our microarray. Among the 171 isolates studied, five different enterococcal species were identified by using the API 20 Strep system: Enterococcus faecium, E. faecalis, E. durans, E. gallinarum, and E. avium. The Enteroarray detected the same species as API 20 Strep, as well as two more: E. casseliflavus and E. hirae. Species comparisons resulted in 15% (27 isolates) disagreement between the two methods among the five API 20 Strep identifiable species and 24% (42 isolates) disagreement when considering the seven Enteroarray identified species. The species specificity of key antibiotic and virulence genes identified by the Enteroarray were consistent with the literature adding further robustness to the redundant taxonomic probe data. Sequencing of the cpn60 gene further confirmed the complete accuracy of the microarray results. The new Enteroarray should prove to be a useful tool to accurately genotype strains of enterococci and assess their virulence potential.
TI  - Multidrug-resistant enterococci in animal meat and faeces and co-transfer of resistance from an Enterococcus durans to a human Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Forty-eight isolates resistant to at least two antibiotics were selected from 53  antibiotic-resistant enterococci from chicken and pig meat and faeces and analysed for specific resistance determinants. Of the 48 multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains, 31 were resistant to two antibiotics (29 to erythromycin and tetracycline, 1 to erythromycin and vancomycin, 1 to vancomycin and tetracycline), 14 to three (erythromycin, tetracycline and vancomycin or ampicillin) and 3 to four (erythromycin, vancomycin, ampicillin and gentamicin). erm(B), tet(M), vanA and aac (6')-Ie aph (2'')-Ia were the antibiotic resistance genes most frequently detected. All 48 MDR enterococci were susceptible to linezolid and daptomycin. Enterococcus faecalis (16), Enterococcus faecium (8), Enterococcus mundtii (2) and Enterococcus gallinarum (1) were identified in meat, and E. faecium (13) and Enterococcus durans (13) in faeces. Clonal spread was not detected, suggesting a large role of gene transfer in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance. Conjugative transfer of resistance genes was more successful when donors were enterococcal strains isolated from faeces; co-transfer of vanA and erm(B) to a human E. faecium occurred from both E. faecium and E. durans pig faecal strains. These data show that multidrug resistance can be found in food and animal species other than E. faecium and E. faecalis, and that these species can efficiently transfer antibiotic resistance to human strains in inter-specific matings. In particular, the occurrence of MDR E. durans in the animal reservoir could have a role in the emergence of human enterococcal infections difficult to eradicate with antibiotics.
TI  - [Evaluation of the usefulness of selective chromogenic agar medium (chromID VRE)  and multiplex PCR method for the detection of vancomycin-resistant enterococci].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate and early detection of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) is critical for controlling nosocomial infection. In this study, we evaluated the usefulness of a selective chromogenic agar medium and of multiplex PCR for detection of VRE, and both these techniques were compared with the conventional culture method for VRE detection. METHODS: We performed the following 3 methods for detecting VRE infection in stool specimens: the routine culture method, culturing in selective chromogenic agar medium (chromID VRE, bioMerieux, France), and multiplex PCR using the Seeplex(R) VRE ACE Detection kit (Seegene Inc., Korea) with additional PCR for vanC genes. RESULTS: We isolated 109 VRE strains from 100 stool specimens by the routine culture method. In chromID VRE, all the isolates showed purple colonies, including Enterococcus gallinarum and E. raffinosus, which were later identified using the Vitek card. All VRE isolates were identified by the multiplex PCR method; 100 were vanA-positive E. faecium, 8 were vanA- and vanC-1-positive E. gallinarum, and 1 was vanA-positive E. raffinosus. CONCLUSIONS: For VRE surveillance, culturing the isolates in chromID VRE after broth enrichment appears to be an accurate, rapid, and easy method for routine screening test. Multiplex PCR is relatively expensive and needs skilled techniques for detecting VRE, but it can be an auxiliary tool for rapid detection of genotype during a VRE outbreak.
TI  - The occurrence of virulence traits among high-level aminoglycosides resistant Enterococcus isolates obtained from feces of humans, animals, and birds in South Korea.
AB  - Enterococcus isolates (1500) obtained from the feces of 48 humans, 209 domesticated food animals, and 155 wild geese in South Korea were characterized with respect to species status by PCR analyses and resistance to antibiotics. Of the 1500 strains examined, the majority (n=577) were Enterococcus faecalis from 224 (54.4%) of the samples feces, while 299 were of E. faecium from 125 of the samples (30.3%), 224 were E. hirae from 101 (24.5%) of the samples, 94 were E. casseliflavus from 43 (10.4%) of the samples, and one was E. gallinarum. While 305 isolated from 125 (30.3%) of the samples were unidentified species. Approximately 15, 60, 50, 55, 3, and 40% of samples obtained from beef cattle, chickens, ducks, swine, wild geese, and humans, respectively, yielded Enterococcus isolates that were resistant to high-levels of aminoglycosides (i.e., of gentamicin, kanamycin, and streptomycin, minimum inhibitory concentrations were >1000 mg/l). The 180 Enterococcus isolates that showed high levels of resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics (HLAR) were screened for virulence genes encoding for aggregation substance (agg), cytolysin activator (cylA), gelatinase (gelE) and surface protein (esp). Of those, the gelE gene was found most frequently in chickens and ducks of the HLAR isolates, while 56 E. faecalis and 13 E. faecium HLAR were gelatinase positive and showed hemolysin activity. Multiple antibiotic resistant Enterococcus isolates carrying virulence genes were most frequently isolated from poultry and swine, and were mostly E. faecalis or E. faecium. These findings suggest that restriction of the use of antibiotics in food animal operations in South Korea, especially those involved in poultry and swine production would be desirable.
TI  - Distribution of antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes in Enterococcus spp. and characterization of isolates from broiler chickens.
AB  - Enterococci are now frequent causative agents of nosocomial infections. In this study, we analyzed the frequency and distribution of antibiotic resistance and virulence genotypes of Enterococcus isolates from broiler chickens. Fecal and cecal samples from nine commercial poultry farms were collected to quantify total enterococci. Sixty-nine presumptive enterococci were isolated and identified by API 20 Strep, and their susceptibilities to antibiotics were determined. Genotypes were assessed through the use of a novel DNA microarray carrying 70 taxonomic, 17 virulence, and 174 antibiotic resistance gene probes. Total enterococcal counts were different from farm to farm and between sample sources (P < 0.01). Fifty-one (74%) of the isolates were identified as E. faecium, whereas nine (13%), seven (10%), and two (3%) isolates were identified as E. hirae, E. faecalis, and E. gallinarum, respectively. Multiple-antibiotic resistance was evident in E. faecium and E. faecalis isolates. The most common multiple-antibiotic resistance phenotype was Bac Ery Tyl Lin Str Gen Tet Cip. Genes conferring resistance to aminoglycoside (aac, aacA-aphD, aadB, aphA, sat4), macrolide (ermA, ermB, ermAM, msrC), tetracycline (tetL, tetM, tetO), streptogramin (satG_vatE8), bacitracin (bcrR), and lincosamide (linB) antibiotics were detected in corresponding phenotypes. A range of 9 to 12 different virulence genes was found in E. faecalis, including ace, agg, agrB(Efs) (agrB gene of E. faecalis), cad1, the cAM373 and cCF10 genes, cob, cpd1, cylAB, efaA(Efs), and gelE. All seven E. faecalis isolates were found to carry the gelE gene and to hydrolize gelatin and bile salts. Results from this study showed the presence of enterococci of public and environmental health concerns in broiler chicken farms and demonstrated the utility of a microarray to quickly and reliably analyze resistance and virulence genotypes of Enterococcus spp.
TI  - Antimicrobial and heavy metal resistance in commensal enterococci isolated from pigs.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance in animal isolates of enterococci is of public health concern because of the risk of transfer of antibiotic resistance isolates or resistance determinants to consumers via the food chain. In this study, phenotypic and genotypic resistance in 192 pig isolates of enterococci to ampicillin, avilamycin, avoparcin, bacitracin, flavophospholipol, gentamicin, narasin, tetracycline, tiamulin, tylosin, vancomycin, virginiamycin, copper and zinc were investigated by susceptibility test and molecular methods. Resistance rates varied between the species but all isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, avilamycin, avoparcin, gentamicin and narasin but resistant to tetracycline and tylosin and intermediately resistant to copper. Only Enterococcus gallinarum and Enterococcus casseliflavus were resistant to vancomycin and virginiamycin resistance was present in less than half the Enterococcus faecium isolates. Zinc resistance was largely confined to Enterococcus faecalis but bacitracin resistance was uncommon in E. faecalis in comparison with the other species. Tiamulin resistance was common in all species except E. casseliflavus. Resistance to flavophospholipol was detected in most E. faecium isolates and in a high proportion of E. gallinarum, E. casseliflavus and E. hirae/durans but was only found in one isolate of E. faecalis. No tetO, rplC, rplD, vanA, vanB, vatA and vatD genes were found. The presence of ermB, tetL, tetM, tcrB, aac6-aph2, tetK, tetS, vanC1, vanC2, lsaA, lsaB and vatE varied between the species and largely corresponded to the susceptibility phenotype. The findings show that resistance to antibiotics of high clinical significance for nosocomial Enterococcus infections is absent, whereas antimicrobial resistance was detected for some other antibiotics including bacitracin, flavophospholipol, tetracycline, tiamulin, tylosin and virginiamycin.
TI  - ccrABEnt serine recombinase genes are widely distributed in the Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus casseliflavus species groups and are expressed in E. faecium.
AB  - The presence, distribution and expression of cassette chromosome recombinase (ccr) genes, which are homologous to the staphylococcal ccrAB genes and are designated ccrAB(Ent) genes, were examined in enterococcal isolates (n=421) representing 13 different species. A total of 118 (28 %) isolates were positive for ccrAB(Ent) genes by PCR, and a number of these were confirmed by Southern hybridization with a ccrA(Ent) probe (n=76) and partial DNA sequencing of ccrA(Ent) and ccrB(Ent) genes (n=38). ccrAB(Ent) genes were present in Enterococcus faecium (58/216, 27 %), Enterococcus durans (31/38, 82 %), Enterococcus hirae (27/52, 50 %), Enterococcus casseliflavus (1/4, 25 %) and Enterococcus gallinarum (1/2, 50 %). In the eight other species tested, including Enterococcus faecalis (n=94), ccrAB(Ent) genes were not found. Thirty-eight sequenced ccrAB(Ent) genes from five different enterococcal species showed 94-100 % nucleotide sequence identity and linkage PCRs showed heterogeneity in the ccrAB(Ent) flanking chromosomal genes. Expression analysis of ccrAB(Ent) genes from the E. faecium DO strain showed constitutive expression as a bicistronic mRNA. The ccrAB(Ent) mRNA levels were lower during log phase than stationary phase in relation to total mRNA. Multilocus sequence typing was performed on 39 isolates. ccrAB(Ent) genes were detected in both hospital-related (10/29, 34 %) and non-hospital (4/10, 40 %) strains of E. faecium. Various sequence types were represented by both ccrAB(Ent) positive and negative isolates, suggesting acquisition or loss of ccrAB(Ent) in E. faecium. In summary, ccrAB(Ent) genes, potentially involved in genome plasticity, are expressed in E. faecium and are widely distributed in the E. faecium and E. casseliflavus species groups.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of fecal indicators in municipal wastewater treatment plant.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance of fecal coliforms (n = 153) and enterococci (n = 199) isolates was investigated in municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) based on activated sludge system. The number of fecal indicators (in influent and effluent as well as in the aeration chamber and in return activated sludge mixture) was determined using selective media. Susceptibility of selected strains was tested against 19 (aminoglycosides, aztreonam, carbapenems, cephalosporins, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors, fluoroquinolones, penicillines, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) and 17 (high-level aminoglycosides, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, fluoroquinolones, glycopeptides, linezolid, lincosamides, nitrofuration, streptogramins, tetracycline) antimicrobial agents respectively. Among enterococci the predominant species were Enterococcus faecium (60.8%) and Enterococcus faecalis (22.1%), while remaining isolates belonged to Enterococcus hirae (12.1%), Enterococcus casseliflavus/gallinarum (4.5%), and Enterococcus durans (0.5%). Resistance to nitrofuration and erythromycin was common among enterococci (53% and 44%, respectively), and followed by resistance to ciprofloxacin (29%) and tetracycline (20%). The resistance phenotypes related to glycopeptides (up to 3.2%) and high-level aminoglycosides (up to 5.4%) were also observed. Most frequently, among Escherichia coli isolates the resistance patterns were found for ampicillin (34%), piperacillin (24%) and tetracycline (23%). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing E. coli was detected once, in the aeration chamber. In the study the applied wastewater treatment processes considerably reduced the number of fecal indicators. Nevertheless their number in the WWTP effluent was higher than 10(4) CFU per 100 ml and periodically contained 90% of bacteria with antimicrobial resistance patterns. The positive selection of isolates with antimicrobial resistance patterns was observed during the treatment processes. Substantial concern should be paid to the isolates resistant to 3 or more chemical classes of antimicrobials (MAR). In treated wastewater MAR E. coli and MAR enterococci constituted respectively 9% and 29% of tested isolates.
TI  - Vancomycin-resistant enterococci from Portuguese wastewater treatment plants.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence of vancomycin resistant enterococci in sludge and sewage of urban and poultry-slaughterhouse wastewater treatment plants. A total of 17 vancomycin resistant enterococci (eight vanA -containing Enterococcus faecium and nine vanC1/vanC2 -containing Enterococcus gallinarum/casseliflavus) were found among 499 isolates of sewage and sludge samples of 14 urban and nine poultry-slaughterhouse wastewater treatment plants. These seventeen VRE isolates showed resistance to kanamycin (n = 8), tetracycline (n = 7), erythromycin (n = 7), ciprofloxacin (n = 7), ampicillin (n = 7), streptomycin (n = 6), and gentamicin (n = 2). The tetM gene, related with tetracycline resistance, was found in six of eight van A-containing isolates, in all seven vanC-1 isolates and in one of two vanC-2 isolates. The ermB gene in seven erythromycin-resistant isolates; and the aac6 '-aph2 '' gene in the two high-level-gentamicin-resistant isolates. Moreover, two vanA -containing E. faecium isolates harbored the hyl virulence gene, and three isolates the entA bacteriocin gene. The purK-1 allele was detected in our urban vanA -containing E. faecium isolate, and we found as well the purK-6 allele in one poultry-slaughterhouse vanA -containing E. faecium isolate. This study suggests that the wastewater treatment plants might be an important source of dissemination of antibiotic-resistant enterococci in Portugal.
TI  - Stored-product insects carry antibiotic-resistant and potentially virulent enterococci.
AB  - A total of 154 enterococcal isolates from 95 stored-product insects collected from a feed mill, a grain storage silo, and a retail store were isolated and identified to the species level using PCR. Enterococcus casseliflavus represented 51% of the total isolates, followed by Enterococcus gallinarum (24%), Enterococcus faecium (14%), Enterococcus faecalis (7%), and Enterococcus hirae (5%). Many isolates were resistant to tetracycline (48%), followed by streptomycin (21%), erythromycin (14%), kanamycin (13%), ciprofloxacin (12%), ampicillin (4%), and chloramphenicol (<1%). Enterococci carried genes coding for virulence factors, including the gelatinase gene gelE (26% of isolates), an enterococcal surface protein gene esp (1%), and the cytolysin gene cylA (2%). An aggregation substance (asa1) gene was detected in six out of 10 E. faecalis isolates and five of these were positive for the aggregation substance. Enterococci were positive for hemolytic (57% of isolates) and gelatinolytic (23%) activity. The filter-mating assay showed that the tetracycline resistance gene, tetM, was transferable among E. faecalis by conjugation. These data demonstrated that stored-product insects can serve as potential vectors in disseminating antibiotic-resistant and potentially virulent enterococci.
TI  - Identification and antimicrobial resistance of Enterococcus spp. isolated from surface water.
AB  - In the study species distributions and antimicrobial resistance profiles were determined among riverine Enterococcus spp. Susceptibility of the isolates was tested against: ampicillin, imipenem, teicoplanin, vancomycin, erythromycin, linezolid, fosfomycin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, tetracycline, high levels of gentamicin and streptomycin. The enterococci were detected in all of the analyzed water samples, periodically exceeding the mandatory standards of the EU Bathing Water Directive. Isolates were predominantly E. faecium (68.6%) and E. faecalis (21.6%) strains. The remaining isolates belonged to E. casseliflavus/gallinarum (5.2%), E. hirae (3.9%), and E. durans (0.7%). Of enterococci strains, 27% were susceptible to all tested antimicrobial agents and as much as 9% were classified as multiple-antibiotic-resistant (MAR). Resistance to erythromycin was common in all investigated areas (55%), followed by resistance to ciprofloxacin (22%) and tetracycline (14%). The resistance phenotypes related to glycopeptides and high-level aminoglycosides were also observed. Relatively low frequency of ampicillin resistance was found among studied strains, in contrast to the frequent use of this antimicrobial agent in Poland. According to the obtained results the Enterococcus should be regarded as an important genus, according to its potential contribution to dissemination of antimicrobial resistance in the water environment.
TI  - Enterococcus species composition determined by capillary electrophoresis of the groESL gene spacer region DNA.
AB  - Marine recreational beaches are monitored for fecal contamination by Enterococcus spp. (ENT) counts. Although different ENT species in the environment tend to thrive in and originate from distinct hosts, the current monitoring method does not differentiate among species. Time-consuming isolation-based species identification precludes routine analysis of environmental ENT communities. Therefore, an isolation-independent DNA fingerprinting method was developed to characterize environmental ENT communities using DNA length polymorphism of the spacer region between the groES and groEL genes common to most ENT species. Capillary electrophoresis resulted in distinct peak sizes of PCR products that carried polymorphic groESL spacers (300-335 bp in length) among 8 different ENT species (Enterococcus avium, Enterococcus gallinarum, Enterococcus casseliflavus, Enterococcus mundtii, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, and Enterococcus faecalis). Distortions in true species ratios observed in electropherograms were caused by PCR biases arising in a mixed ENT community DNA template. E. faecalis was overestimated and E. avium and E. faecium were underestimated compared to the original species ratios in the mixed community. The PCR product bias was constant between species, so good approximation of the species ratio in ENT communities is possible. In environmental samples, a high percentage of E. faecalis (96%) together with high total ENT counts were observed in samples collected from a sewer line and from several sites in a storm drain system where sewage leaks were suspected. In contrast, samples with <400 CFU 100 ml-1 ENT were either dominated by E. mundtii or had 4 or more ENT species. The latter ENT community profiles are considered to be signatures of enterococci rarely associated with animals with low or of non-fecal origin.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in faecal bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp.) in feral pigeons.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the presence of antibiotic-resistant faecal Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. in feral pigeons (Columba livia forma domestica) in the Czech Republic. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cloacal swabs of feral pigeons collected in the city of Brno in 2006 were cultivated for antibiotic-resistant E. coli. Resistance genes, class 1 and 2 integrons, and gene cassettes were detected in resistant isolates by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The samples were also cultivated for enterococci. Species status of enterococci isolates was determined using repetitive extragenic palindromic-PCR. Resistance genes were detected in resistant enterococci by PCR. E. coli isolates were found in 203 of 247 pigeon samples. Antibiotic resistance was recorded in three (1.5%, n(E. coli) =203) isolates. Using agar containing ciprofloxacin, 12 (5%, n(samples) =247) E. coli strains resistant to ciprofloxacin were isolated. No ESBL-producing E. coli isolates were detected. A total of 143 enterococci were isolated: Ent. faecalis (36 isolates), Ent. faecium (27), Ent. durans (19), Ent. hirae (17), Ent. mundtii (17), Ent. gallinarum (12), Ent. casseliflavus (12) and Ent. columbae (3). Resistance to one to four antibiotics was detected in 45 (31%) isolates. Resistances were determined by tetK, tetL, tetM, tetO, aac(6')aph(2''), ant(4')-Ia, aph(3')-IIIa, ermB, pbp5, vanA and vanC1 genes. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic-resistant E. coli and Enterococcus spp. occurred in feral pigeons in various prevalences. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Feral pigeon should be considered a risk species for spreading in the environment antimicrobial resistant E. coli and enterococci.
TI  - Regional spread of vanA- or vanB-positive Enterococcus gallinarum in hospitals and long-term care facilities in Kyoto prefecture, Japan.
AB  - Following an outbreak of vanA-positive Enterococcus faecium in 2005 in Kyoto prefecture, regional surveillance of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) was initiated. This revealed vanA- or vanB-positive Enterococcus gallinarum in multiple facilities. Eighty-eight vanA-positive E. gallinarum faecal carriers from 12 facilities and ten vanB-positive E. gallinarum faecal carriers from eight facilities were found. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiles of the first isolate from each facility showed that 11 of the 12 vanA isolates and three of the eight vanB-positive E. gallinarum isolates belonged to a single clone. This study confirms the clonal spread of vanA- or vanB-positive E. gallinarum in a region and underlines the importance of surveillance of VRE for the presence of vancomycin resistance determinants.
TI  - [Detection of vancomycin-resistant enterococci using multiplex real-time PCR assay and melting curve analysis].
AB  - BACKGROUND: We developed and evaluated the utility of a multiplex real-time PCR assay that uses melting curve analysis and allows simultaneous identification of vancomycin-resistant genotypes and clinically relevant enterococci. METHODS: The specificity of the assay was tested using 4 reference strains of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and 2 reference strains of vancomycin-susceptible enterococci. Ninety-three clinical isolates of enterococci with different glycopeptide-resistant phenotypes were genotyped and identified using a multiplex real-time PCR assay and melting curve analysis. RESULTS: Representative melting curves were obtained for Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, vanA-containing E. faecium, vanB-containing E. faecalis, Enterococcus gallinarum, and Enterococcus casseliflavus. Phenotypic and genotypic analysis of the isolates revealed same results for 82 enterococcal isolates, while in 4 isolates, the glycopeptide-resistant phenotypes were inconsistent with the glycopeptide-resistant genotypes and in the 4 other isolates, species could not be accurately identified. Three isolates with mixed strains, which were detected by the PCR assay, could not be correctly identified using phenotypic methods. CONCLUSIONS: VRE genotyping and identification of clinically relevant enterococci were rapidly and correctly performed using multiplex real-time PCR assay and melting curve analysis.
TI  - Bacteremia caused by non-faecalis and non-faecium enterococcus species at a Medical center in Taiwan, 2000 to 2008.
AB  - SUMMARY OBJECTIVES: Human infections due to non-faecalis and non-faecium Enterococcus species are emerging but data on the characteristics of these infections are limited. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the computerized database of the bacteriology laboratory at National Taiwan University Hospital from January 2000 through December 2008 to identify patients with non-faecalis and non-faecium enterococcal bacteremia. RESULTS: Enterococcal bacteremia was diagnosed in 1887 patients during the study period and was caused by non-faecalis and non-faecium enterococci in 182 (9.6%) of these patients. The causative organisms included Enterococcus casseliflavus (n = 59, 3.1%), Enterococcus gallinarum (n = 58, 3.0%), Enterococcus avium (n = 45, 2.4%), Enterococcus hirae (n = 9, 0.5%), Enterococcus raffinosus (n = 9, 0.5%), Enterococcus durans (n = 2, 0.1%), Enterococcus cecorum (n = 2, 0.1%), and Enterococcus canintestini (n = 1, 0.5%). A commercially-available phenotypic identification system misidentified six isolates based upon sequence analysis of 16S and groESL genes. Among the 182 patients, 74 (40.7%) had catheter-associated bloodstream infection and 69 (37.9%) presented with biliary tract infection. Healthcare-associated enterococcal bacteremia comprised 99 (54.4%) episodes and a polymicrobial etiology was found in 106 (58.2%) episodes. The clinical manifestations varied between the infecting Enterococcus species. Multivariate logistic regression showed that immunocompromised status is the only risk factor for the all cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Non-faecalis and non-faecium Enterococcus species can cause protean manifestations which vary with the infecting Enterococcus species. Misidentification of unusual enterococcal species might occur by the commercial identification methods and accurate identification with molecular methods is required.
TI  - Characterization of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus isolates from broilers in Selangor, Malaysia.
AB  - Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) is an emerging nosocomial pathogen in humans. The use of antibiotics in human therapy and in the production of food animals has been incriminated in the emergence of this organism. The present study describes the distribution of VRE species, the vancomycin-resistant genes detected, the vancomycin resistance pattern observed, and the genetic diversity of the isolates found in live broiler chickens in Malaysia. Overall 140 VRE were isolated with species comprising Enterococcus faecalis (48%), Enterococcus faecium (25.7%), Enterococcus gallinarum (12.1%), Enterococcus casseliflavus (1.4%) and other Enterococcus species (12.8%). Vancomycin resistance gene vanA and intrinsic genes vanC1 and vanC2/3 were detected in the study population. VanA was detected in 15 (63.9%) of E. faecium, 23 (22.4%) of E. faecalis and in 3 (17.6%) E. gallinarum isolates. E-test was conducted on randomly selected 41 of the isolates and the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) of vancomycin for five (11.9%) of tested isolates is more than 256 mug/ml. Genotypic analysis using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) showed genetic diversity within the Enterococcus species.
TI  - High-quality draft genome sequences of 28 Enterococcus sp. isolates.
AB  - The enterococci are low-GC Gram-positive bacteria that have emerged as leading causes of hospital-acquired infection. They are also commensals of the gastrointestinal tract of healthy humans and most other animals with gastrointestinal flora and are important for food fermentations. Here we report the availability of draft genome sequences for 28 enterococcal strains of diverse origin, including the species Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, E. casseliflavus, and E. gallinarum.
TI  - Prevalence and antibiotic resistance profiles of Enterococcus species in chicken  at slaughter level; absence of vanA and vanB genes in E. faecalis and E. faecium.
AB  - The prevalence of enterococci in neck skin samples of poultry from Ankara region  in Turkey was investigated and their antibiotic resistance patterns were determined. In the study, 83 of 106 analyzed neck skin samples were positive for Enterococcus, with E. faecium as the most prevalent species (48%) followed by E. durans (23%) and E. faecalis (19%). Lower numbers were detected for E. gallinarum, E. hirae, E. mundtii and E. casseliflavus. Using the disc diffusion method, it was established that over 90% of E. faecium and E. faecalis isolates were high-level resistant against erythromycin and tetracycline. Four E. faecium isolates were additionally resistant to chloramphenicol, gentamicin and streptomycin, though they were susceptible to penicillin G. The most frequently observed multiple resistance in E. faecium (25%) was against erythromycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and streptomycin. Of the E. faecalis isolates, 44% were multiple resistant to erythromycin, tetracycline and streptomycin. Vancomycin resistance could not be demonstrated phenotypically and vanA or vanB genes were not detected by multiplex PCR in any of the isolates. Nevertheless, the observed resistance patterns are of concern for public health.
TI  - MLST and a genetic study of antibiotic resistance and virulence factors in vanA-containing Enterococcus from buzzards (Buteo buteo).
AB  - AIMS: To analyse the occurrence of faecal carriage of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in Buteo buteo and to study the associated resistance and virulence genes. METHODS AND RESULTS: The presence of VRE was investigated in 33 faecal samples of B. buteo. Samples were seeded in Slanetz-Bartley agar plates supplemented with vancomycin for VRE recovery. Genes encoding antimicrobial resistance and virulence were studied by polymerase chain reaction. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium isolates were characterized by multilocus sequence typing. VRE with an acquired mechanism of resistance (vanA genotype) were detected in 9% of samples analysed (Ent. faecium and Enterococcus durans). In addition, 27% of samples contained VRE with an intrinsic mechanism of resistance (Enterococcus gallinarum, vanC1). All vanA-containing isolates showed resistance to tetracycline and erythromycin and harboured the tet(M) and/or tet(L) genes, in addition to the ermB gene. The vat(E) and/or vat(D), cat(A) and aph(3')-IIIa genes were identified in quinupristin-dalfopristin-, chloramphenicol-, and kanamycin-resistant vanA-containing strains, respectively. The sequence types ST273 and ST5 were identified in two vanA-positive Ent. faecium isolates, and the presence of hyl, gelE, cylA, cylL and cylM virulence genes and gelatinase activity were identified in Ent. faecium ST5 strain. CONCLUSIONS: The intestinal tract of B. buteo could be a reservoir of vanA-positive enterococci. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: First study focused to define the occurrence of vanA-containing Enterococcus strains in B. buteo.
TI  - Enterococcus species distribution among human and animal hosts using multiplex PCR.
AB  - AIMS: This study evaluated the use of Enterococcus species differentiation as a tool for microbial source tracking (MST) in recreational waters. METHODS AND RESULTS: Avian, mammalian and human faecal samples were screened for the occurrence of Enterococcus avium, Enterococcus casseliflavus, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus gallinarum, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus hirae and Enterococcus saccharolyticus using multiplex PCR. Host-specific patterns of Enterococcus species presence were observed only when data for multiple Enterococcus species were considered in aggregate. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that no single Enterococcus species is a reliable indicator of the host faecal source. However, Enterococcus species composite 'fingerprints' may offer auxiliary evidence for bacterial source identification. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: This study presents novel information on the enterococci species assemblages present in avian and mammalian hosts proximate to the nearshore ocean. These data will aid the development of appropriate MST strategies, and the approach used in this study could potentially assist in the identification of faecal pollution sources.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of enterococci isolated from mastitic bovine milk samples in Korea.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial resistance of various species of enterococci isolated from mastitic bovine milk samples. A total of 105 enterococci isolates were examined: Enterococcus faecalis (n = 47), Enterococcus faecium (n = 39), Enterococcus gallinarum (n = 6), Enterococcus avium (n = 6), Enterococcus hirae (n = 5) and Enterococcus durans (n = 2). All the isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin and vancomycin, and only a single E. hirae isolate was resistant to ampicillin. In general, the most frequently observed resistance among the enterococcal isolates was to tetracycline (69.5%), followed by penicillin (64.7%), erythromycin (57.1%) and cephalothin (44.7%). A similar antimicrobial resistance pattern was observed among individual species except E. durans, which exhibited only tetracycline resistance. Resistance observed among isolates of E. hirae and E. gallinarum was almost as high as E. faecium and E. faecalis. Of 105 isolates, only six (5.7%) strains of E. faecium were susceptible to all the antimicrobials tested and about 52% (55/105) showed resistance to more than three antimicrobials. The most common multiple resistance pattern was penicillin, tetracycline and erythromycin, which was observed in 32 of 105 (30.4%) isolates. This study demonstrates that enterococcal isolates belonging to minor species showed antimicrobial resistance rates as high as those of E. faecium and E. faecalis, and that monitoring of antimicrobial resistance should not be restricted only to those two major species.
TI  - Novel Bacteriophages in Enterococcus spp.
AB  - Most of the bacteriophages (phages) currently reported in Enterococcus spp. belong to tailed families of bacteriophages Podoviridae, Siphoviridae, and Myoviridae. There is a little information on non-tailed bacteriophages isolated from enterococci. Samples of sewage and piggery effluents were tested on pig and chicken isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium and E. gallinarum for lytic phages. In addition, isolates were exposed to mitomycin C to induce lysogenic phages. Bacteriophages that were detected were visualized by electron microscopy. Ten bacteriophages were of isometric shape with long flexible or non-flexible tails, while one had a long head with a long flexible tail; all contained double-stranded DNA molecules. Seven Polyhedral, filamentous, and pleomorphic-shaped phages containing DNA or RNA were also observed. The pleomorphic phages were droplet- or lemon-shaped in morphology. This study is the first report on polyhedral phages in Enterococcus spp. of animal origin and also the first report of filamentous and pleomorphic phages in enterococci.
TI  - Cross-transmission of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus in patients undergoing dialysis and kidney transplant.
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) cross-transmission between two patient groups (long-term dialysis and kidney transplant patients). Molecular typing, by automated ribotyping with the RiboPrinter Microbial Characterization System (Qualicon, USA), was used to analyze VRE isolates from 31 fecal samples of 320 dialysis patients and 38 fecal samples of 280 kidney transplant patients. Clonal spread of E. faecalis and E. casseliflavus was observed intragroup, but not between the two groups of patients. In turn, transmission of E. gallinarum and E. faecium between the groups was suggested by the finding of vancomycin-resistant isolates belonging to the same ribogroup in both dialysis and transplant patients. The fact that these patients were colonized by VRE from the same ribogroup in the same health care facility provides evidence for cross-transmission and supports the adoption of stringent infection control measures to prevent dissemination of these bacteria.
TI  - Characterization of enterococci populations collected from a subsurface flow constructed wetland.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to identify and characterize the population of Enterococcus sp. in domestic wastewater as it flows through a constructed wetland. METHODS AND RESULTS: Four hundred and eighty-four Enterococcus isolates were collected from the inlet, various sites within and from the outlet of a plastic lined constructed wetland in College Station, TX. The wetland treated septic tank effluent that passed sequentially through two 1.89 m(3) septic tanks and a 1.89 m(3) pump tank allowing 48 l doses at a 24 l min(-1) rate. The Enterococcus isolates were identified to species using the commercial Biolog system. The 484 Enterococcus isolates were comprised of ten different species, including Enterococcus faecalis (30.6%), Enterococcus pseudoavium (24.0%), Enterococcus casseliflavus (12.8%), Enterococcus faecium (11.2%), Enterococcus mundtii (7.9%), Enterococcus gallinarum (6.2%), Enterococcus dispar (3.7%), Enterococcus hirae (2.1%), Enterococcus durans and Enterococcus flavescens both 0.8%. Of the 88 isolates collected from the inlet, only 9.1% of the isolates were identified as Ent. faecalis and Ent. pseudoavium (36.4%) was identified as the predominant species. Whereas of the 74 isolates collected from the outlet, the predominant species were identified as Ent. faecalis (29.7%). Species identification varied among sites within the wetland, but often Ent. faecalis was the predominant species. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that while Ent. faecalis is the predominant species of Enterococcus found in domestic wastewater, the populations may shift during treatment as the wastewater flows through the constructed wetland. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: We found that shifts in Enterococcus species composition occurred during domestic wastewater treatment. This has implications for the identification of faecal pollution based on the presence of specific bacterial types associated with domestic wastewater.
TI  - vanA in Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus casseliflavus detected in French cattle.
AB  - The goal of this study was to assess the presence of enterococci species presenting van-mediated glycopeptide resistance in French cattle. Fecal samples were collected from healthy and sick animals, and enterococci were screened for vancomycin resistance. Vancomycin resistance was principally encountered in Enterococcus gallinarum and Enterococcus casseliflavus strains. However, glycopeptide resistance was detected in three different species of enterococci (E. faecalis, E. faecium, and E. casseliflavus). Molecular characterization of the genetic support proved that they all presented the prototypic VanA element. Interestingly, the E. casseliflavus strain displayed a remarkable VanB phenotype/vanA-vanC genotype. Transferability, associated resistances, and factors of vanA cotransfer were sought. This study proved that acquired vanA genes can still be detected in food-producing animals more than a decade after the avoparcin ban. Indeed, calves, which are recurrently exposed to antibiotics in France, may allow the re-emergence of glycopeptide resistance through coselection factors, and this might potentially be concerning for human health.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in Singapore.
AB  - AIMS: To characterise the mechanism of glycopeptide resistance, genetic relatedness, and pathogenicity factors in isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in Singapore. METHODS: A total of 292 Enterococcus faecium and 17 Enterococcus faecalis were isolated from humans, and five E. faecium, two Enterococcus durans, two Enterococcus flavescens, one Enterococcus casseliflavus, and one Enterococcus gallinarum from chickens. The mechanism of glycopeptide resistance and pathogenicity factors were studied by PCR and the genetic relatedness determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multi-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA), and Tn1546 analysis. RESULTS: There were five outbreak clones among the vancomycin-resistant E. faecium with one clone predominant. Four of the clones were vanB positive, and only one clone carried vanA. All outbreak clones were esp gene positive. Sporadic human isolates and chicken isolates were vanA positive and did not contain any pathogenicity genes. The situation was reversed in vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis where almost all isolates were vanA positive. CONCLUSIONS: Most VRE in Singapore is hospital associated with a small number of clones of esp-positive vanB E. faecium responsible for the majority of isolates.
TI  - Aryl rhodanines specifically inhibit staphylococcal and enterococcal biofilm formation.
AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus are the leading causative agents of indwelling medical device infections because of their ability to form biofilms on artificial surfaces. Here we describe the antibiofilm activity of a class of small molecules, the aryl rhodanines, which specifically inhibit biofilm formation of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and E. gallinarum but not the gram-negative species Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Escherichia coli. The aryl rhodanines do not exhibit antibacterial activity against any of the bacterial strains tested and are not cytotoxic against HeLa cells. Preliminary mechanism-of-action studies revealed that the aryl rhodanines specifically inhibit the early stages of biofilm development by preventing attachment of the bacteria to surfaces.
TI  - [Glycopeptide-resistant enterococci carriage: Are actual isolation and identification techniques sufficient?].
AB  - The monitoring of infection by glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE) is one of the main elements of hospital hygiene policy. It involves systematic rectal swabs in clinics at risk (asymptomatic carriage). AIM: We compare two GRE screening methods and evaluate a new kit associating multiplex PCR and hybridization (Genotype((R)) Enterococcus, Hain Lifescience) on a panel of 448 samples collected over a 4-month period. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The first method is based on direct inoculation of the sample; the second one involves a preliminary enrichment phase followed by molecular diagnosis allowing the identification of species of enterococci as well as glycopeptide resistance genes. RESULTS: All the resistant strains were isolated using the enrichment technique. The incidence of GRE (VanA) carriage was 0,55% (two out of 362 patients, two out of 448 isolates) with two Enterococcus faecium VanA. Six Enterococcus gallinarum VanC1 and two Enterococcus casseliflavus VanC2/C3 were also isolated and identified. The main clinics concerned are intensive care and hematology. The two patients with E. faecium VanA had been previously given glycopeptides for 10 days. For three strains, the molecular method allowed to correct prior erroneous results based on rapid identification (RapidID32Strep V2.0). CONCLUSION: The method using direct samples inoculation underestimates real incidence of GRE carriage. The performances of Genotype((R)) Enterococcus molecular method, evaluated for other parameters using reference strains and DNA sequencing, offer new possibilities applicable to routine laboratory.
TI  - Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. in marine environments from the West Coast of the USA.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of the study was to determine if vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus  spp. [VRE] carrying vanA and/or vanB genes were present in public marine beaches and a fishing pier [2001-2003, 2008] from Washington and California [2008]. METHODS: PCR assays for the vanA and/or vanB genes with verification by DNA-DNA hybridization of the PCR products were used. Positive isolates were speciated using the BD BBL Crystal Identification and/or by sequencing the 16S ribosomal region. RESULTS: Eighteen (8%) of 227 isolates including Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus casseliflavus/gallinarum and a Staphylococcus epidermidis carrying vanA and/or vanB genes, from four of six Washington and one of two California sites, were identified. Selected VRE and the S. epidermidis were able to transfer their van genes to an E. faecalis recipient at frequencies ranging from 1.9 x 10(-6) to 6.7 x 10(-9). CONCLUSIONS: Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. was isolated from five of the seven sites suggesting that other North America public beaches could be the reservoirs for VRE and should be assessed. SIGNIFICANCE & IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first report of isolation and characterization of VRE strains (and a vanB Staphylococcus sp.) from North American environmental sources suggesting that public beaches may be a reservoir for possible transmission of VRE to beach visitors.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis with the gelatinase phenotype regulated by the fsr operon and with biofilm-forming capacity are common in the agricultural environment.
AB  - The prevalence of gelatinase activity and biofilm formation among environmental enterococci was assessed. In total, 396 enterococcal isolates from swine and cattle faeces and house flies from a cattle farm were screened for gelatinase activity. The most prevalent phenotype on Todd-Hewitt agar with 1.5% skim milk was the weak protease (WP) (72.2% of isolates), followed by the strong protease (SP) 18.7%, and no protease (NP) (9.1%). The majority of WP isolates was represented by Enterococcus hirae (56.9%), followed by Enterococcus faecium (25.9%), Enterococcus casseliflavus (10.4%), Enterococcus gallinarum (5.2%) and Enterococcus saccharolyticus (1.7%). All WP isolates were negative for gelE (gelatinase) and sprE (serine protease) as well as the fsrABDC operon that regulates the two proteases, and only four isolates (7.0%) formed biofilms in vitro. All SP isolates were Enterococcus faecalis positive for the fsrABDC, gelE, sprE genes and the majority (91.2%) formed a biofilm. Diversity of NP isolates was relatively evenly distributed among E. hirae, E. faecium, E. casseliflavus, E. gallinarum, Enterococcus durans, E. saccharolyticus and Enterococcus mundtii. All NP isolates were negative for the fsr operon and only four E. hirae (11.1%) formed a biofilm. Of further interest was the loss of the gelatinase phenotype (18.9% of isolates) from SP isolates after 4 month storage at 4-8 degrees C and several passages of subculture. Results of reverse transcription PCR analysis indicated that mRNA was produced for all the genes in the frs operon and sequencing of the gelE gene did not reveal any significant mutations. However, gelatinase was not detectable by Western blot analysis. Our study shows that E. faecalis with the complete fsr operon and the potential to form a biofilm are relatively common in the agricultural environment and may represent a source/reservoir of clinically relevant strains. In addition, many environmental enterococci, especially E. hirae, produce an unknown WP that can hydrolyse casein but does not contribute to biofilm formation. The stability of the gelatinase phenotype in E. faecalis and its regulation will require additional studies.
TI  - The homogeneity of vanB gene cluster among enterococcal isolates in Iran.
AB  - AIMS: This study aimed to analyse the diversity of the vanB gene cluster in enterococcal species isolated from sewage treatment plants (STP) in Tehran, Iran. METHODS AND RESULTS: The enterococcal isolates were collected from three sewage treatment plants in Tehran, Iran, during 2005. A total of 203 enterococcal isolates, collected over six rounds of sampling from three STPs were tested for the presence of vanB gene. Long-PCR showed that amongst the isolates, three Enterococcus faecium, one Enterococcus gallinarum and one Enterococcus casseliflavus harboured the complete vanB gene cluster. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the vanB1 gene cluster (5900 bp) from the isolates showed an identical pattern to a standard strain of Enterococcus faecalis (V583). None of the isolates were able to transfer the vanB gene in conjugation experiments. Different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns were obtained for the three E. faecium isolates with vanB gene clusters. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that the dissemination of vanB is not widespread in Tehran. Although only a few vanB positive isolates were detected, vanB was found in several enterococcal species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: In view of the lack of information on vanB resistance genes and their diversity in Iran, knowledge of the global dissemination of vanB genes in Enterococcus spp. is noteworthy.
TI  - Identification and tracing of Enterococcus spp. by RAPD-PCR in traditional fermented sausages and meat environment.
AB  - AIMS: Four local small-scale factories were studied to determine the sources of enterococci in traditional fermented sausages. METHODS AND RESULTS: Different points during the production of a traditional fermented sausage type (fuet) were evaluated. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR was used to type 596 Enterococcus isolates from the final products, the initial meat batter, the casing, the workers' hands and the equipment. Species-specific PCR-multiplex and the partial sequencing of atpA gene and 16S rRNA gene sequencing allowed the identification of the isolates: Enterococcus faecalis (31.4%), Enterococcus faecium (30.7%), Enterococcus sanguinicola (14.9%), Enterococcus devriesei (9.7%), Enterococcus malodoratus (7.2%), Enterococcus gilvus (1.0%), Enterococcus gallinarum (1.3%), Enterococcus casseliflavus (3.4%), Enterococcus hermanniensis (0.2%), and Enterococcus durans (0.2%). A total of 92 different RAPD-PCR profiles were distributed among the different factories and samples evaluated. Most of the genotypes found in fuet samples were traced back to their source. CONCLUSIONS: The major sources of enterococci in the traditional fermented sausages studied were mainly the equipment followed by the raw ingredients, although a low proportion was traced back to human origin. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This work contributes to determine the source of enterococcal contamination in fermented sausages and also to the knowledge of the meat environment.
TI  - Nosocomial outbreak of Enteroccocus gallinarum: untaming of rare species of enterococci.
AB  - An unusual increase in infections caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus gallinarum (VREG) was identified in May 2004, in a Colombian tertiary care teaching hospital. A case-control study was subsequently designed to identify risk factors associated with the development of infections due to these organisms. All VREG isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, vancomycin resistance gene detection and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing. Additionally, the presence of genes associated with an acquired pathogenicity island of E. faecalis and a hyl-like gene of E. faecium was assessed by hybridisation assays. Eleven cases of VREG were identified between May through June 2004. VREG was isolated from blood (N=4), surgical secretions (N=4), paranasal sinus secretion (N=1), lung abscess (N=1) and urine (N=1). Infections with VREG were associated with mucositis, hospitalisation in the haematology ward and surgical unit, length of hospital stay prior to culture and invasive procedures within 30 days prior to the culture. Logistic regression found that female sex and hospitalisation in the surgical unit were independent factors for VREG infection. All isolates were identified as E. gallinarum, harboured the vanC1 gene and exhibited indistinguishable restriction patterns by PFGE. Virulence-associated genes were not detected. This is the first documented hospital-wide outbreak of VREG and highlights the fact that uncommon species of enterococci are capable of nosocomial dissemination.
TI  - Molecular characterization of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. clinical isolates from Hungary and Serbia.
AB  - The objectives of this work were to collect and characterize vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) clinical isolates from Hungary and Serbia and to analyse their genetic relatedness. VREF isolates were initially typed by PFGE. A selection of VREF isolates representing all participating hospitals was further examined by multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). VanB VREF isolates (n=18) recovered from blood, urine and faecal cultures at a Budapest hospital between August 2003 and December 2004 were molecularly characterized. Macrorestriction analysis of the isolates revealed their monoclonal relatedness. A cluster of infections caused by 2 distinct VanA VREF clones recovered from 6 departments was identified in a Belgrade hospital in Serbia. The vanA resistance determinant was transferable by in vitro conjugation experiments. We also identified 2 vanA-positive E. gallinarum blood culture isolates in this Belgrade hospital. Molecular typing of representative VREF isolates from Hungary and Serbia by MLVA and MLST revealed that all tested isolates belonged to MLST complex CC17 and the corresponding MLVA cluster 1. Our results extend the documented occurrence of CC17 to a new region in Europe.
TI  - Prevalence and characterization of Enterococcus spp. isolated from Brazilian foods.
AB  - Enterococci can be used in the food industry as starter or probiotic cultures. However, enterococci are also implicated in severe multi-resistant nosocomial infections. In this study, the prevalence of enterococci in selected Brazilian foodstuffs (raw and pasteurized milk, meat products, cheeses and vegetables) was evaluated. Phenotypic and PCR protocols were used for species identification. Tests for production of gelatinase, haemolysin, bacteriocin and bile salt hydrolysis were done with all enterococci isolates, whereas molecular determination of virulence markers (genes esp, gel, ace, as, efaA, hyl and cylA) and antibiotic resistance was checked only for Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis isolates. The antibiotic-resistant isolates were assayed for biofilm formation and adhesion to mammalian cells. From the 120 food samples analyzed, 52.5% were positive for enterococci, meat and cheese being the most contaminated. E. faecium was the predominant species, followed by E. faecalis, E. casseliflavus and Enterococcus gallinarum. Phenotypic tests indicated that 67.7% of isolates hydrolyzed bile salts, 15.2% produced bacteriocin, 12.0% were beta-hemolytic and 18.2% produced gelatinase. Antibiotic resistance (gentamicin, tetracycline and erythromycin) and genes encoding for virulence traits were more frequent in E. faecalis than in E. faecium. Three E. faecium isolates were resistant to vancomycin. Among antibiotic-resistant isolates, 72.4% of E. faecalis were able to form biofilm and 13.8% to adhere to Caco-2 cells. Antibiotic-resistant E. faecalis and E. faecium isolates were grouped by RAPD-PCR and a scattered distribution was noted, indicating that resistance was not related to a particular clone. The spread of virulence/resistance traits in isolates of the two species and different RAPD-types suggest the pathogenic potential of both species. By contrast, the recovery of bacteriocinogenic E. faecium isolates with no virulence traits suggests their potential for biotechnological applications. In conclusion, our results showed that enterococci from Brazilian foods present important dualist aspects for food safety.
TI  - Potential of houseflies to contaminate ready-to-eat food with antibiotic-resistant enterococci.
AB  - It was shown previously that houseflies in fast-food restaurants commonly carry antibiotic-resistant and potentially virulent enterococci. In this study, the potential of field-collected houseflies to contaminate ready-to-eat (RTE) food with enterococci was assessed by laboratory bioassays. Houseflies were collected with a sweep net in a cattle feedlot and exposed in groups of 5, 10, 20, and 40 to a beef patty (from an RTE hamburger) for 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, and 24 h. The exposure of RTE food to flies resulted in 100% contamination with enterococci in all bioassays, regardless of the number of houseflies and the length of exposure time. In addition, with the increasing number of houseflies as well as with the increasing time exposure, the concentration of enterococci in RTE food increased. Even a short time exposure (0.5 h) resulted in food contamination, ranging from 3.1 x 10(3) CFU/g (5 houseflies) to 8.4 x 10(4) CFU/g (40 houseflies). The analysis of 23 randomly selected enterococcal isolates from RTE food after the fly exposure revealed a single species, Enterococcus faecalis. In contrast, four Enterococcus species, including E. faecalis (57.1%), E. gallinarum (19.1%), E. hirae (14.3%), and E. faecium (9.5%), represented 21 randomly selected and identified isolates from houseflies. Phenotypic screening showed that E. faecalis isolates from RTE food were resistant to ciprofloxacin (17.4%), tetracycline (13.0%), erythromycin (13.0%), and chloramphenicol (4.3%). This study demonstrates a great potential of houseflies from a cattle feedlot to contaminate RTE food with enterococci in a short time.
TI  - A "retrocidal" plasmid in Enterococcus faecalis: passage and protection.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis MC4 harbors a 130 kb conjugative, pheromone (cCF10)-responding plasmid, pAMS1, conferring chloramphenicol, streptomycin and tetracycline resistances. A plasmid-borne class IIa bacteriocin (MC4-1) determinant and cognate immunity gene were present, but not expressed in MC4. However, pAMS1 transfer to E. faecalis JH2-2 (but not to the non-isogenic OG1SS) generated the surprising ability to express bacteriocin activity against the plasmid donor, MC4. The bacteriocin target spectrum includes E. faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus gallinarum, Enterococcus hirae, and Listeria monocytogenes. Those donors unable to express bacteriocin or immunity could protect themselves from the "retrocidal" behavior of transconjugants by a switch to bacteriocin resistance at a frequency of approximately 10(-3). Reversion to sensitivity occurred at a relatively high frequency, suggestive of involvement of a phase variation event. These observations concerning a conjugative plasmid with novel "retrocidal" properties, coupled with a defense mechanism independent of plasmid-borne immunity functions, may relate to phenomena exploiting regulatory features with broader ecological and evolutionary implications.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility and distribution of antimicrobial-resistance genes among Enterococcus and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus isolates recovered from poultry litter.
AB  - Data on the prevalence of antimicrobial resistant enterococci and staphylococci from the poultry production environment are sparse in the United States. This information is needed for science-based risk assessments of antimicrobial use in animal husbandry and potential public-health consequences. In this study, we assessed the susceptibility of staphylococci and enterococci isolated from poultry litter, recovered from 24 farms across Georgia, to several antimicrobials of veterinary and human health importance. Among the 90 Enterococcus isolates recovered, E. hirae (46%) was the most frequently encountered species, followed by E. faecium (27%), E. gallinarum (12%), and E. faecalis (10%). Antimicrobial resistance was most often observed to tetracycline (96%), followed by clindamycin (90%), quinupristin-dalfopristin (62%), penicillin (53%), erythromycin (50%), nitrofurantoin (49%), and clarithromycin (48%). Among the 110 staphylococci isolates recovered, only coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were identified with the predominant Staphylococcus species being S. sciuri (38%), S. lentus (21%), S. xylosus (14%) and S. simulans (12%). Resistance was less-frequently observed among the Staphylococcus isolates for the majority of antimicrobials tested, as compared with Enterococcus isolates, and was primarily limited to clarithromycin (71%), erythromycin (71%), clindamycin (48%), and tetracycline (38%). Multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotypes were prevalent in both Enterococcus and Staphylococcus; however, Enterococcus exhibited a statistically significant difference in the median number of antimicrobials to which resistance was observed (median = 5.0) compared with Staphylococcus species (median = 3.0). Because resistance to several of these antimicrobials in gram-positive bacteria may be attributed to the shuttling of common drug-resistance genes, we also determined which common antimicrobial-resistance genes were present in both enterococci and staphylococci. The antimicrobial resistance genes vat(D) and erm(B) were present in enterococci, vgaB in staphylococci, and mobile genetic elements Tn916 and pheromone-inducible plasmids were only identified in enterococci. These data suggest that the disparity in antimicrobial-resistance phenotypes and genotypes between enterococci and staphylococci isolated from the same environment is, in part, because of barriers preventing exchange of mobile DNA elements.
TI  - Low prevalence of vancomycin- and bifunctional aminoglycoside-resistant enterococci isolated from poultry farms in Malaysia.
AB  - A total of 225 samples from poultry farms and the surrounding environment were screened for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and bifunctional aminoglycoside-resistant enterococci using conventional microbiological tests and a nanoplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Three (1.3%) of the samples were found to contain vancomycin-resistant isolates (MIC>256 microg/mL) that had a vanA genotype. The three vanA positive VRE isolates were identified as different species. Only one isolate (Enterococcus faecium F 4/13_54) was sensitive to teicoplanin (MIC<0. 12-0.35 microg/mL); the other two VRE (E. faecalis A 21_35 and E. gallinarum F 5/10_1) were resistant to teicoplanin (MIC 3.6-->16 microg/mL). The vanC genotype was observed in nine (4%) of the samples collected. High-level gentamicin-resistant (HLGR) enterococci (with MIC ranging between 100 and 500 microg/mL) were detected in 44 samples. However, only 40 of these were found to possess the aac(6')-aph(2'') gene. The overall prevalence of VRE among the samples from the poultry farms and environment was 5.3%, but the prevalence of the clinically significant vanA VRE was 1.3%, and the prevalence of bifunctional aminoglycoside-resistant enterococci was slightly higher, at 19.5%.
TI  - Comparative analysis of genetic diversity and incidence of virulence factors and  antibiotic resistance among enterococcal populations from raw fruit and vegetable foods, water and soil, and clinical samples.
AB  - A comparative study was carried out among enterococci isolated from fruits and vegetable foods, water and soil, and clinical samples. Results indicate strong differences in the numbers of enterococcal species found in different environments as well as their abundance. While Enterococcus faecalis was clearly the predominant species in clinical samples, Enterococcus faecium predominated in vegetables, and it slightly outnumbered E. faecalis in water samples. Other species (Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus mundtii, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus gallinarum and Enterococcus casseliflavus) were found more frequently in vegetables, water, and specially in soil. Isolates from vegetable foods showed a lower incidence of antibiotic resistance compared to clinical isolates for most antimicrobials tested, especially erythromycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gentamicin and streptomycin for E. faecalis, and quinupristin/dalfopristin, ampicillin, penicillin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, rifampicin, choramphenicol, gentamicin and nitrofurantoin for E. faecium. E. faecium isolates from vegetable foods and water showed an average lower number of antibiotic resistance traits (2.95 and 3.09 traits for vegetable and water isolates, respectively) compared to clinical samples (7.5 traits). Multi-resistant strains were also frequent among clinical E. faecalis isolates (5.46 traits on average). None of E. faecalis or E. faecium isolates from vegetable foods, water and soil showed beta-haemolytic activity, while 25.64% of clinical E. faecalis did. A 51.28% of E. faecalis clinical isolates tested positive for the cylA, cylB, cylM set of genes, while some or all of these genes were missing in the rest of isolates. In clinical E. faecalis and E. faecium isolates, the genetic determinants for the enterococcal surface protein gene (esp), the collagen adhesin gene (ace) and the sex pheromone gene ccf (as well as cob in E. faecalis) showed a clearly higher incidence compared to isolates from other sources. E. faecalis isolates from vegetable foods and water had much lower average numbers of virulence genetic determinants per strain (4.23 and 4.0, respectively) compared to clinical isolates (8.71). Similarly, among E. faecium the lowest average number of traits per strain occurred in vegetable food isolates (1.72) followed by water (3.9) and clinical isolates (4.73). Length heterogeneity (LH)-PCR typing with espF-aceF-ccfF and espF-ccfF primers revealed genomic groups that clearly differentiated clinical isolates from those of vegetable foods, water and soil (except for two clinical isolates). The large differences found in the incidence of antibiotic resistance and virulence factors and in the genetic fingerprints determined by LH-PCR suggest a clear separation of hospital-adapted populations of enterococci from those found in open environments.
TI  - [Enterococcus spp. colonized in the gastrointestinal tract of patients in hemato-oncology and intensive care units and their resistance profiles to vancomycin].
AB  - The aim of this study was to identify the Enterococcus spp. and to determine their vancomycin-resistance profiles, in the samples collected from the patients who were described as risky groups for vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) colonization, in scope of a survey study carried out in our hospital for the first time. Rectal swab samples were taken once in a month from a total of 180 patients who were hospitalized in the Surgery and Intensive Care Units, adult Oncology-Hematology and Pediatric Oncology Units between March-December 2006. The samples were cultivated onto bile-esculine agar media, and Miniapi system (bioMerieux, France) was used for the identification at species-level (Rapid ID 32 Strep kit, bioMerieux, France) and for the detection of antimicrobial susceptibilities (ATB Enterococcus kit, bioMerieux, France). MIC levels have been determined by the use of vancomycin E-test (AB Biodisk, Sweden) strips in brain-heart infusion agar (Merck, France). According to the culture results, 126 of the patients (70%) have been found to be colonized with Enterococcus spp. The most frequently isolated species were as follows respectively; E. faecium (42%), E. faecalis (31%), E. avium (12%), E. gallinarum (8%) and E. casseliflavus, (5.6%). Four of the E. faecium strains (3.2%) were found resistant to vancomycin by both automated antibiotic susceptibility test system and E-test (MIC >256 mg/ml). Vancomycin-resistant strains have been identified as being VanA genotypes by polymerase chain reaction. Beta-lactamase production has not been detected in any one of the strains with the use of nitrocephin (Remel, U.S.A.) disk. As a result the colonization rates of enterococcal species and VRE were found as 70% and 3.2%, respectively in our patients. Infections with VRE have not been detected in colonized patients during the follow-up period. In conclusion, in order to detect and prevent the spread of VRE, surveillance cultures should be regularly performed from hospitalized patients, in collaboration with educational studies for hospital personel, controlling the use of vancomycin and cephalosporins and cooperation between microbiology laboratories and inpatient clinics.
TI  - [Epidemiological search for vancomycin-resistant enterococci in mainland of the Ryukyus].
AB  - During the period from January through December 2007, a total of 1,814 stool specimens from the inpatients of nine regional hospitals in mainland of the Ryukyus, were tested to identify vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). All the stool specimens were primarily cultured onto the VRE selective agar plates, and a total of 195 specimens yielded positive enterococcal growth. Of 195 isolates, VRE screening agar tests identified 106 phenotypic VRE isolates, consisting 24 isolates of Enterococcus casseliflavus, 12 of E. faecalis, 4 of E. faecium, and 66 of E. gallinarum. Then, the 106 VRE isolates were tested for vanA and vanB genes by polymerase chain reaction, the results indicating none of the isolates were positive for vanA or vanB genes. With these results, it can be concluded that, at present, mainland of the Ryukyus is VRE-free area, and it is necessary to continue careful search for incoming and spreading of VRE positive for vanA and vanB genes in Okinawa.
TI  - Low prevalence of VRE gastrointestinal colonization of hospitalized patients in Manitoba tertiary care and community hospitals.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE)  bowel colonization in hospitalized patients in Manitoba who had stool specimens collected for Clostridium difficile toxin and/or culture testing. DESIGN: Two tertiary care and five community hospitals in Winnipeg and three rural Manitoba community hospitals participated in this study. From January 1 to December 31, 1997 stool specimens, one per patient, submitted to hospital microbiology laboratories for C difficile toxin and/or culture testing were screened for VRE on colistin-nalidixic acid-vancomycin (6 microg/mL) (CNAV) agar plates. The study was divided into six, eight-week intervals. Stool specimens received in the first two weeks of each eight week interval were screened for VRE. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 1408 stool specimens were submitted over the 48-week study period. Sixty-seven (4.8%) patients with VRE colonization of their lower gastrointestinal tract were identified. Three of the 67 (4.5%) VRE isolates were Enterococcus faecium, with the remaining 64 (95.5%) were Enterococcus gallinarum. The three vancomycin-resistant E faecium -VREF- (from two different Winnipeg hospitals) demonstrated the vanA genotype, and were resistant to vancomycin, teicoplanin and ampicillin. All three VREF isolates also demonstrated high level resistance to both gentamicin and streptomycin but were susceptible to quinuprisitin/dalfopristin and LY333328. CONCLUSION: VRE colonization in hospitalized patients in Manitoba is infrequent and most commonly due to E gallinarum. The prevalence of VREF colonization in the patients studied was 0.2% (three of 1408).
TI  - Isolation and purification of enterocin E-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain NRRL B-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecium, or Enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to Campylobacter jejuni. The isolate produced a 5,362-Da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, S. enterica serovar Gallinarum, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Yersinia enterocolitica, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other Campylobacter species isolates. The enterocin, E-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. The proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin E-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. Specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase K, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. The enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees C and was stable at pH values between 5.0 and 8.7. However, activity was lost below pH 3.0 and above pH 9.5. Administration of enterocin E-760-treated feed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of C. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) CFU. Enterocin E-760 also significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired Campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance profiles of enterococci isolated from poultry meat and pasteurized milk in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
AB  - The enterococci are important nosocomial pathogens with a remarkable capacity of  expressing resistance to several antimicrobial agents. Their ubiquitous nature and resistance to adverse environmental conditions take account for their ability to colonize different habitats and for their potential for easy spreading through the food chain. In the present study we evaluated the distribution of species and antimicrobial susceptibility among enterococcal isolates recovered from food obtained in retail stores in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The following species were identified among 167 isolates obtained from poultry meat and 127 from pasteurized milk: Enterococcus faecalis (62.6%), E. casseliflavus (17.3%), E. durans (6.5%), E. gallinarum (3.0%), E. gilvus (2.4%), E. faecium (2.0%), E. hirae (1.4%), and E. sulfureus (1.0%). The overall percentages of antimicrobial resistant isolates were: 31.2 % to tetracycline, 23.8% to erythromycin, 11.3% to streptomycin, 4.3% to chloramphenicol, 3.9% to gentamicin, 1.4% to norfloxacin, 1.1% to imipenem, 0.7% to ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, and penicillin, and 0.4% to ampicillin. Intermediate resistance was detected in frequencies varying from 0.5% for linezolid to 58.2% for erythromycin. None of the isolates showed resistance to glycopeptides. High-level resistance to aminoglycosides was observed in 13.1% of the isolates. Multiresistance was observed in E. faecalis, E. casseliflavus, E. faecium, E. gallinarum, E. durans and E. gilvus.
TI  - Distribution of enterococcal species and detection of vancomycin resistance genes by multiplex PCR in Tehran sewage.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enterococci are important because of their role as the leading cause  of nosocomial infections which have a significant role in the dissemination and persistence of antimicrobial resistance genes. METHODS: In this study, we determined the distribution of enterococcal species in the sewage treatment plants in Iran. Furthermore, we improved a rapid and specific PCR method using primers (sodA and ddl genes) for identification of enterococci spp. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: A total number of 712 enterococci spp. were isolated and the results showed that 56%, 24%, 12%, 4%, 2%, 1% and 1% isolates were E. faecium, E. hirae, E. faecalis, E. gallinarum, E. casseliflavus, E. mundtii and other enterococcal spp., respectively. The use of species-specific PCR was in agreement with the biochemical tests. Furthermore, multiplex PCR was developed to study the presence of vancomycin resistant genes in E. faecium or E. faecalis. The multiplex PCR appeared to be a useful, rapid and specific method for detecting and discriminating genotypes for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus.
TI  - Evaluation of different PCR-based approaches for the identification and typing of environmental enterococci.
AB  - The aim of the work was the evaluation of different PCR-based methods to found an appropriate identification and typing strategy for environmental enterococci. Environmental enterococci were isolated mainly from surface- and waste-waters. Species identification was provided by combination of phenotypic (Micronaut System, Merlin) and molecular detection methods (fluorescent ITS-PCR, ddl-PCR, REP-PCR, AFLP). Very similar results were observed among molecular methods, however several discrepancies were recognized during comparison of molecular and biochemical identification. Seven enterococcal species (E. faecium, E. hirae, E. casseliflavus, E. mundtii, E. faecalis, E. durans and E. gallinarum) were identified within 166 environmental isolates. The results obtained in this work attest the importance of PCR-based methods for identification and typing of environmental enterococci. The fluorescent ITS-PCR (fITS-PCR) showed the best results in order to identify the enterococci strains, the method used the automated capillary electrophoresis to separate the PCR products in a very rapid and precise way. The AFLP method was suitable to identify and characterize the isolates, while the REP-PCR can be used for species identification.
TI  - [A 6-year study of glycopeptides-resistant enterococci in 3 intensive care units  of the University Hospital of Montpellier].
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to evaluate the rate of glycopeptides-resistant enterococci (GRE) fecal carriage (species and resistance determinants). Strains isolated between 1999 and 2005 during systematic screening for multiresistant bacteria in patients hospitalized in 3 intensive care units (ICU) of the University Hospital of Montpellier were studied. METHODS: The systematic screening was weekly performed. Rectal swabs were cultured on D-Coccosel agar medium containing 4 mg/l vancomycin and MICs for vancomycin and teicoplanin were determined by E-test. Strains were subjected to both phenotypic and genotypic identification and vanA, vanB and vanC genes were detected by PCR. RESULTS: We analyzed 13003 samples for 5113 patients. Among them, 401 (7.84%) patients were GRE carriers with 280 Enterococcus gallinarum (vanC(1)), 102 Enterococcus casseliflavus-flavescens (vanC(2)-C(3)), 5 Enterococcus faecalis (3 vanA, 2 vanB), and 14 Enterococcus faecium (10 vanA, 4 vanB). A unique case of cross contamination between two patients was observed. During the same time, only one strain of GRE was isolated during an infectious process in another unit. Carriage rate of E. faecium and E. faecalis vanA or vanB was 0.37%: 68.4, 21 and 10.6% in the gastrointestinal, in the polyvalent and the respiratory ICU, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our results were in agreement with national data showing a relatively low GRE fecal carriage rate in ICUs, E. faecium vanA being the mainly encountered GRE. Since 2004, GRE detection is increasingly reported in France and an emerging E. faecium vanA clone has been identified during outbreaks. In contrast, only one E. faecium vanB strain has been isolated in our institution since this date and a unique strain of E. faecalis vanA was isolated during an infectious process since 1999. These data underlined the efficacy of transmission prevention measures established when GRE are identified.
TI  - Assessment of safety of enterococci isolated throughout traditional Terrincho cheesemaking: virulence factors and antibiotic susceptibility.
AB  - Enterococci account for an important fraction of the adventitious microflora of traditional cheeses manufactured in Mediterranean countries from small ruminants' raw milk and play an important role in the development of suitable organoleptic characteristics of the final product. It has been suggested that animals used for food or animals that supply edible products are a reservoir of antibiotic-resistant enterococci. The main purpose of this research effort was thus to identify, to the species level, a total of 73 enterococci with high tolerance to acidic pH and bile salts (as prevailing environmental conditions in the first portion of the gastrointestinal tract), which were previously isolated from the milk feedstock to the final product of Terrincho cheesemaking, and to determine their profiles of antibiotic susceptibility, coupled with the occurrence of specific virulence factors (especially in those that might eventually be claimed to exhibit suitable probiotic and technological performances). Isolates, identified by both API 20 STREP and PCR methods, were found to belong to the following Enterococcus species: E. casseliflavus, E. durans, E. faecalis, E. faecium, and E. gallinarum. Susceptibility of those isolates was observed to most antibiotics tested, whereas none harbored aminoglycoside resistance genes. PCR screenings for cytolysin genes (cylL(L), cylL(s), cylM, cylB, and cylA), surface adhesin genes (efaA(fs), efaA(fm), and esp), the aggregation protein gene (agg), and the extracellular metalloendopeptidase gene (gelE) were performed. All isolates proved negative for cylL(L), cylM, cylB, and agg genes. Both E. faecalis strains were positive for the cell wall-associated protein Esp and the cell wall adhesin efaA(fs), whereas the cell wall adhesin efaA(fm) was detected in 11 of the 12 E. faecium strains. Only one strain possessed the cylL(s) determinant, and another possessed the cylA gene. Incidence of virulence determinants was thus very low; hence, the enterococcal adventitious microflora tested is essentially safe.
TI  - High prevalence of tetracycline resistance in Enterococcus isolates from broilers carrying the erm(B) gene.
AB  - A total of 73 isolates of Enterococcus spp. carrying the erm(B) gene were obtained from cloacal swabs of broiler chickens derived from 13 different farms in Belgium. The erm(B) gene encodes resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin B antibiotics (MLS(B)). The isolates belonged to eight different species: Enterococcus avium (eight isolates), Enterococcus casseliflavus (11 isolates), Enterococcus cecorum (eight isolates), Enterococcus durans (seven isolates), Enterococcus faecalis (10 isolates), Enterococcus faecium (17 isolates), Enterococcus gallinarum (seven isolates) and Enterococcus hirae (five isolates). Acquired resistance to tetracycline was detected in 68 of the isolates, and in 62 of these it was associated with the presence of the resistance genes tet(L), tet(M), tet(O) or tet(S). In three E. faecium isolates that were phenotypically susceptible to tetracycline, tet(L) or tet(M) was present. The transposon integrase gene (int gene) of the Tn916/Tn1545 transposon family was detected in 18 of the 54 isolates that contained the tet(M) gene. It was concluded that acquired resistance to tetracycline antibiotics is often present in enterococci from poultry carrying the erm(B) gene. The use of tetracyclines in poultry may therefore co-select for resistance to MLS(B) antibiotics, which may be important as alternative therapy for enterococcal infections in humans.
TI  - Gram-positive bloodstream infections in liver transplant recipients: incidence, risk factors, and impact on survival.
AB  - The objective of the study was to assess the incidence, risk factors, and survival of gram-positive bloodstream infections (GP-BSI(s)) among liver transplant recipients during the first year after transplantation. Between October 2000 and September 2006, 42 episodes of GP-BSI(s) occurred in 205 patients with an overall incidence of 0.20 episodes/patient. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were detected in 45.2% of cases, Enterococcus species in 42.9% (E faecalis, eight; E faecium, seven; E avium, two; E gallinarum, one) and Staphylococcus aureus in 11.9%. Retransplantation was the only independent risk factor for GP-BSI (odds ratio [OR], 0.253; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.089 to 0.715; P = .009). Thirty-day mortality rate was 28.5% and S aureus infections were related to a poorer outcome. It is noteworthy that all the isolates of S aureus were methicillin-resistant. Ampicillin was inactive against all the strains of E faecium and 50% of E avium isolates, but active against all E faecalis and E gallinarum strains. All the isolates were glycopeptide-susceptible. No significant differences in mortality rate were observed in relation to sex, etiologies of end-stage liver disease, cytomegalovirus infection/reinfection, type of donor, rejection, or retransplantation. GP-BSI, the only independent risk factor for death (OR, 0.262; 95% CI, 0.106 to 0.643; P = .003), reduced the survival rate by 26% in the first year posttransplant. In conclusion, GP-BSI(s) impact significantly on morbidity and mortality posttransplant, particularly among retransplantations. Control measures are required to reduce the incidence of GP-BSI(s) in liver transplant recipients. These findings must be considered when empirical antimicrobial therapy is indicated while awaiting blood-culture results.
TI  - [Vancomycin and high-level aminoglycoside resistant Enterococcus carriage and the risk factors related to resistance in hospitalized patients].
AB  - The aims of this study were to detect the prevalence of fecal vancomycin resistant Enterococcus (VRE) colonization with high-level resistance to aminoglycoside and other antibiotics and, the risk factors related to resistance in hospitalized patients in Duzce Medical Faculty Hospital, Turkey. A total of 105 patients (61 from internal medicine, 44 from surgery clinics; 54.3% female, mean age: 47.2 +/- 24.54 years) were included to the study and a single stool sample was collected from each of the patients. Specimens were cultivated in Enterococcus selective media (BioMerieux, France), and the isolates were identified by conventional microbiological methods together with the API 20 Strep test. Beta-lactamase activities of the isolates were tested with nitrocefin disk, and antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by the disk diffusion method. Enterococcus spp. were isolated from 81 (77%) of the patients' samples and 60.5% were identified as E. faecium, 13.6% as E. faecalis, 11.1% as E. gallinarum, 7.4% as E. durans, 2.5% as E. raffinosus, 2.5% as E. mundtii, 1.2% as E. casseliflavus, and 1.2% as E. avium. High-level streptomycin and gentamicin resistance rates were found in 19.8% and 9.9% of the isolates, respectively. The resistance rates for the other antibiotics were found as follows; 18.5% to ampicillin, 27.2% to penicilin, 34.6% to nitrofurantoin, 65.4% to norfloxacin, and 70.4% to both tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. No vancomycin resistance was detected, and none of the enterococci had beta-lactamase activity. Long hospitalization period, antibiotic usage and experience of intra-abdominal operation were found as the significant risk factors for colonization of the resistant bacteria. Our results demonstrated that there was no fecal VRE carriage in our hospital during the study period, however, it was concluded that the screening tests should be done periodically in order to detect resistant strains as soon as possible.
TI  - Rapid identification of clinically relevant Enterococcus species by fluorescence  in situ hybridization.
AB  - A fluorescence in situ hybridization assay for the rapid identification of clinically relevant enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, E. gallinarum, the VanC-type resistance group) was developed and evaluated with 33 reference strains, 68 clinical isolates, and 58 positive blood cultures. All probes showed excellent sensitivities and specificities.
TI  - Prevalence, identification and distribution of various species of enterococci isolated from clinical specimens with special reference to urinary tract infection in catheterized patients.
AB  - Various clinical specimens were processed to find the prevalence rate of enterococci and to identify the species of clinical isolates of enterococci. Screening of various clinical specimens revealed that enterococci were prevalent in 22.19% of the total specimens, with Foley's catheters and burn wounds to be the major site of isolation. High rate of colonization was noted as opposed to infection. Conventional test scheme proposed by Facklam and Collins were successfully used to speciate enterococcal strains. Seven species of enterococci were identified in the study from a set of 202 cultures, with E.faecalis (49.50%) and E. faecium (35.64%) predominating. E. avium (9.40%), E. hirae (2.47%), E. raffinosus (1.98%) and one isolate each of E.gallinarum and E. casseliflavus were the other members of Enterococcus species identified. Urinary tract infection (UTI) by enterococci due to catherisation was found in 8.92% of the patients and is probably the result of high rate of colonization of Foley's catheters and use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
TI  - Epidemiology and molecular characterization of vancomycin resistant Enterococci isolates in India.
AB  - Little attention has been paid to the problem of the spread of vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) in India. Between August 2002 to March 2003, faecal and urine samples of patients from various wards of the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India, were screened for vancomycin resistance. 36 VRE were isolated (18 Enterococcus gallinarum, 9 E. casseliflavus, 7 E. faecium and 2 E. faecalis). These isolates were characterized as low-, moderate- and high-level resistant strains by phenotypic as well as genotypic methods such as minimum inhibitory concentration determination, polymerase chain reaction assays, sequencing of PCR products and multiple sequence alignment of van genes. Correlations established between these results and the vancomycin resistance markers were designated as vanA (783 bp), vanB (635 bp), vanC1 (822 bp) and vanC2 (484 bp) according to the findings of earlier workers as well as comparison with existing databases. Prolonged hospital stay and vancomycin were important risk factors for both VRE UTI and colonization. Renal dialysis, renal failure, prior aminoglycoside and third generation cephalosporin were the other significant factors for VRE UTI. The study also highlights the importance of screening for VRE in clinical samples and recommends the institution of control measures to prevent the further spread of VRE.
TI  - Vancomycin-resistant enterococci in a Chinese hospital.
AB  - In investigating the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VREs) in a hospital in China, 338 enterococci were detected by using multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Eleven VREs were found, including one VanA E. faecalis, one VanB E. faecium, three VanB E. faecalis, five VanC(1) E. gallinarum, and one VanC(2 ) E. flavescens. VITEK 2, microbroth dilution, and E-test were used to determine the susceptibilities of the VREs to certain antimicrobial agents; multiple-drug resistance of the 11 VREs was distinct. Compared with phenotypic methods, multiplex PCR rapidly detected 11 VREs and provided van genotype information. This is the first study that sequenced van genes of VRE isolates in China to date and found type VanB in China. Because of the relatively low isolating rate, early detection of VRE is vital.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Enterococcus species isolated from Slovak Bryndza cheese.
AB  - Three hundred and ten enterococcal isolates (178 Enterococcus faecium, 68 E. durans, 49 E. faecalis, 8 E. italicus, 3 E. gallinarum, 3 E. casseliflavus, and 1 E. hirae) from Slovak Bryndza cheese were evaluated for susceptibility to nine antimicrobial agents (vancomycin, teicoplanin, ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, erythromycin, rifampicin, nitrofurantoin, and ciprofloxacin). All enterococcal isolates from Bryndza cheese were susceptible to ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin as determined by the disk diffusion method. Vancomycin resistance genes vanA and vanB were not detected. Resistance rates of enterococcal isolates to rifampicin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin were 24, 26, 2, and 1 %, respectively. Thirty-six % of E. faecium isolates and 22 % of the E. faecalis isolates were resistant to erythromycin. Resistance to rifampicin was similar in E. faecium (31 %) and E. faecalis (29 %). Both E. faecium and E. faecalis strains showed the same resistance to ciprofloxacin (2 %). E. durans isolates showed low levels of resistance to rifampicin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin (1-4 %). Forty-eight (30 %) of the E. faecium isolates, two (3 %) of the E. durans isolates, and six (12 %) of the E. faecalis isolates exhibited multidrug resistance. The highest frequency of resistant enterococci was observed in Bryndza produced in winter season.
TI  - Vancomycin-resistant enterococci, colonizing the intestinal tract of patients in  a university hospital in Greece.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Determine the prevalence of Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) colonizing the intestinal tract of hospitalized patients and define risk factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A point prevalence survey of VRE fecal carriage was carried out among patients who stayed at a 600-bed teaching hospital for at least two days. Resistance to vancomycin was detected by the E-test method. Epidemiological data was recorded for all patients included in the study and was used for the risk factor analysis. RESULTS: A total of 128 patients hospitalized for at least two days were enrolled in this investigation. Thirty-nine patients (30.5%) were colonized with vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Twenty-three of the 39 strains were identified as Enterococcus faecium, 13 were identified as Enterococcus gallinarum and three strains as Enterococcus casseliflavus. The risk factors that were significantly associated with VRE colonization included length of hospital stay (13.2 days vs. 8.6 days), age (60.7 years vs. 47.7 years) and the presence of underlying malignancies (28.2% vs. 11.2%). An association was found between VRE colonization and the use of antimicrobials with anaerobic activity, such as metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem. The use of vancomycin was associated with VRE colonization in the intensive care unit. CONCLUSIONS: VRE colonization must be monitored, and risk factors should be determined, because they are useful for screening hospitalized patients for VRE colonization in order to establish prevention and control measures.
TI  - Molecular identification and diversity of enterococci isolated from Slovak Bryndza cheese.
AB  - Three hundred and eight presumed enterococcal isolates were recovered from Bryndza, a soft sheep milk cheese. The cheese samples were obtained from five different commercial distributors in Slovakia and were taken at three different seasonal intervals. All isolates were identified to the species level using genotypic tools. Species-specific PCR using ddl genes highlighted the predominance of Enterococcus faecium (176 isolates) and assigned 50 isolates to the species Enterococcus faecalis. The remaining 82 isolates were classified using repetitive element sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primer (GTG)(5)-(GTG)(5)-PCR, in combination with phenylalanyl-tRNA synthase gene (pheS) sequence analysis and by whole-cell protein analysis (SDS-PAGE). These strains were identified as Enterococcus durans (59 strains), Enterococcus italicus (8 strains), Enterococcus casseliflavus (3 strains), Enterococcus gallinarum (3 strains), Enterococcus hirae (1 strain), and 8 strains were members of the species Lactococcus lactis. Of the seven enterococcal species isolated, three of them, E. durans, E. faecalis and E. faecium were present in all samples studied, with E. faecium as the predominant one. The precise identification of enterococci in Bryndza cheese is an essential step in the process of evaluation of their functional properties which will be further studied and assessed.
TI  - Vancomycin-resistant enterococci from animal sources in Korea.
AB  - Enterococci for which the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of vancomycin was >/=8 mg/l were isolated from meat, feces, and raw milk samples collected in Korea from March to November 2003. Among the 243 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) that were identified the vanA vancomycin resistance gene was carried by 51 Enterococcus faecium and one Enterococcus sp., vanC1 was carried by 151 Enterococcus gallinarum, vanC2 was carried by 39 Enterococcus casseliflavus, and one Enterococcus sp. carried no van genes. Of the isolated enterococci carrying vanA, 4% were found to be highly resistant to gentamicin and 11% were resistant to ampicillin. Further genotyping of the E. faecium isolates carrying vanA using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) revealed extensive heterogeneity. The vancomycin resistance transferability test revealed that only two of the 52 enterococci carrying the vanA gene were able to transfer vancomycin resistance to other enterococci. The VRE were recovered from various animal sources with a particularly high prevalence of E. faecium carrying the vanA gene being found in poultry meat.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of Enterococcus strains obtained from a probiotic product on in vitro growth of Salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis strain IFO3313.
AB  - Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus gallinarum strains were isolated from a commercial probiotic product and the effects of these strains on the growth of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis strain IFO3313 were investigated. Viable cell counts of Salmonella Enteritidis in mixed cultures with the probiotic product isolate of E. faecium were significantly (P < 0.05) lower than those in pure cultures after 6, 8, and 24 h when the cultures were incubated in heart infusion broth at 37 and 41 degrees C. Significant differences in viable cell counts of Salmonella Enteritidis in mixed cultures with the probiotic product isolate of E. gallinarum and those in pure cultures were also observed after 8 and 24 h at 37 and 41degrees C. Similar observations were shown in mixed cultures of Salmonella Enteritidis with the reference strains of E. faecium GIFU8355 and E. gallinarum ATCC 49573. Significant differences in viable cell counts of these enterococcal strains were not shown among pure and mixed cultures with Salmonella Enteritidis. The pH values in pure and mixed cultures were 7.0 or 7.5 throughout the experiments. E. faecium strains were found to harbor the genes encoding enterocins A and B and showed inhibitory zones with a diameter of 4 to 6 mm against growth of Salmonella Enteritidis in the enterocin production assays. However, the E. gallinarum strains possessed neither of the enterocin genes tested and exhibited no inhibition zone in the enterocin production assays. These results indicated that enterococcal strains exhibit inhibitory effects on the growth of Salmonella Enteritidis and these effects were due to both enterocin and nonenterocin factors.
TI  - Copper resistance in Enterococcus faecium, mediated by the tcrB gene, is selected by supplementation of pig feed with copper sulfate.
AB  - The tcr gene cluster mediates in vitro copper resistance in Enterococcus faecium. Here we describe the selection of tcr-mediated copper resistance in E. faecium in an animal feeding experiment with young pigs fed 175 mg copper/kg feed (ppm), which is the concentration commonly used for piglets in European pig production. tcr-mediated copper resistance was not selected for in a control group fed low levels of copper (6 ppm). We also show coselection of macrolide- and glycopeptide-resistant E. faecium in the animal group fed the high level of copper. Finally, we identify the tcr genes in the enterococcal species E. mundtii, E. casseliflavus, and E. gallinarum for the first time.
TI  - Use of the Phoenix automated system for identification of Streptococcus and Enterococcus spp.
AB  - The Phoenix system (Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD) was evaluated for identification (ID) to the species level of streptococci and enterococci. Two hundred clinical isolates were investigated: beta-hemolytic streptococci (n = 50), Streptococcus pneumoniae organisms (n = 46), viridans group streptococci (n = 31), Enterococcus faecium (n = 36), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 25), and other catalase-negative cocci (n = 12). The API system (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) was used as a comparator. Molecular methods (sequencing of 16S rRNA and zwf and gki genes and ddl gene amplification) were used to investigate discordant results. Upon resolution of discrepancies, correct species ID was achieved by the Phoenix system for 121/129 (93.8%) streptococci and 63/70 (90.0%) enterococci. Excellent results were obtained for S. pneumoniae (45/45) and beta-hemolytic streptococci (49/50). With regard to viridans streptococci, the accuracy of the Phoenix system was 83.9%. Among the latter organisms, the best performance was obtained with isolates of the Streptococcus sanguinis group and Streptococcus anginosus group; problems were instead encountered with the Streptococcus mitis group. Four E. faecium and three E. faecalis isolates were misidentified as Enterococcus casseliflavus/Enterococcus gallinarum or Enterococcus durans. Thus, these isolates were identified only at the genus level. Compared with commercially available systems, the Phoenix system appears a reliable diagnostic tool for identifying clinically relevant streptococci and enterococci. The SMIC/ID-2 panel proved particularly effective for beta-hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci.
TI  - Prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in hospitalized patients and those living in the community in the Czech Republic.
AB  - Between July 1, 2002 and December 31, 2003, rectal swabs from both hospitalized patients and community subjects in the Czech Republic were taken to ascertain the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). The swabs were used for isolating and identifying enterococci and their susceptibility to antibiotics. Vancomycin resistance phenotypes were verified by PCR detection of vanA, vanB, vanC1 and vanC2 genes. A molecular biology analysis was performed in Enterococcus faecium VanA strains. During the observed period, 2691 rectal swabs from the hospitalized patients and 6529 rectal swabs from the subjects in community setting were examined. In total, 31 VRE of hospital origin and 13 community-population strains were isolated. The prevalence of VRE in the gastrointestinal tract was 1.9% in the hospitalized patients and 0.4% in the community subjects. The prevailing strains were Enterococcus faecium VanA (61.3%) in the VRE of hospital origin and Enterococcus gallinarum VanC (46.2%) in the community VRE. Mutual comparison between the hospital and community Enterococcus faecium VanA strains showed no similarity.
TI  - PFGE analysis of enterococci isolates from recreational and drinking water in Greece.
AB  - Biotyping and DNA fingerprinting by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis were applied to a collection of enterococci recovered from recreational and drinking water, in order to identify possible genetic relationships. Clinical strains of hospital origin were compared to the environmental isolates. A total of 104 enterococci were isolated from 128 recreational water (94 marine and 34 river water) and 470 drinking water supplies (440 municipal and 30 natural spring water samples). Sixty-two isolates were characterised as Enterococcus faecium recovered from all sources, 32 E. faecalis (from all sources), 4 E. durans (from marine, river and municipal water), 4 E. gallinarum (from marine water) and 2 E. avium (from marine and municipal water). Biotypes, determined with API20Strep, among E. faecium were correlated with certain environmental sources, while antibiotypes, determined with Etest, did not reveal any relationship to the sample origin. Even though genetic diversity was observed among the studied strains, common clonal types were also identified in different sources, suggesting a possible common origin of the enterococci. Cluster analysis revealed a genetic relationship between certain environmental E. faecium and clinical strains.
TI  - Colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in intensive care unit patients in Cordoba City, Argentina.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) among intensive care unit (ICU) patients in a hospital in Cordoba, Argentina. We collected 235 rectal swab specimens from 147 ICU patients. Resistance to vancomycin was screened with the disk diffusion method, and MICs were determined with the E-test method. Vancomycin-resistant genotypes were determined by PCR. The VRE strains were isolated from 18/147 patients (12.2%). The isolates were identified as Enterococcus faecium (94.4%), and Enterococcus gallinarum (5.6%). PCR showed that the E. faecium strains carried the vanA gene, and the E. gallinarum strain carried the vanC1 gene. Our study indicated that at least 12.2% of ICU patients were VRE carriers.
TI  - Assessment of two commercial susceptibility test methods for determination of daptomycin MICs.
AB  - Daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic with activity against several important gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including drug-resistant staphylococci and enterococci. Because the mechanism of action of daptomycin is calcium-dependent depolarization of the cell membrane, susceptibility testing requires medium supplemented with a physiological level of calcium. This study assessed two Food and Drug Administration-cleared commercial test devices for determination of daptomycin MICs, Etest and JustOne. A collection of 220 selected isolates, including Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, E. avium, E. durans, E. casseliflavus, and E. gallinarum, were tested by both methods. Included in the collection were 22 S. aureus and 14 Enterococcus sp. isolates that were recovered from patients and were nonsusceptible on the basis of the daptomycin MICs. As the reference method for comparison, all isolates were tested by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute broth microdilution method incorporating cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth with 50 microg/ml calcium. Daptomycin MICs agreed, within 1 twofold dilution, for 97% of the isolates by Etest and for 100% by JustOne. However, daptomycin MICs determined by Etest were 1 dilution lower than the reference MICs for 65% of the Enterococcus sp. isolates tested. This resulted in 28.5% very major (VM) errors (4/14) with enterococci (all E. faecium) but none (0/22) with staphylococci. Use of JustOne yielded MICs that were 1 dilution lower than the reference MICs for 69% of the staphylococci and 25% of the enterococci. This resulted in 13.6% VM errors (3/22) with staphylococci and 14.3% VM errors (2/14) with enterococci. The manufacturer-recommended JustOne inoculum preparation resulted in mean colony counts of only 5 x 10(4) to 1 x 10(5) CFU/ml in the wells of the strip. Increasing the inoculum to 3 x 10(5) to 4 x 10(5) CFU/ml eliminated two of five VM errors upon retesting. No major interpretive errors occurred with either device. In summary, daptomycin MICs generated by the Etest or JustOne method generally agreed within 1 dilution of the reference daptomycin MICs. However, both devices produced slightly lower MICs that resulted in some VM errors.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance and mechanisms implicated in clinical enterococci in a Tunisian hospital.
AB  - Susceptibility testing for 15 antibiotics was performed in a series of 191 clinical enterococci recovered in a Tunisian Hospital during 2000-2003. Species detected were the following ones (number of isolates): E. faecalis (139), E. faecium (41), E. casseliflavus (5), E. gallinarum (3), E. avium (2) and E. hirae (1). The percentages of antibiotic resistance detected were as follows (E. faecalis/ E. faecium/ other species) : penicillin (0/ 73/ 9%), tetracycline (78/ 44/ 54%), chloramphenicol (52/ 29/ 27%), erythromycin (66/ 100/ 82%), spiramycin (84/ 83/ 64%), pristinamycin (100/ 0/ 73%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (88/ 78/ 91%), rifampicin (72/ 41/ 0%), vancomycin (0/ 0/ 36%), teicoplanin (0/ 0/ 0%), high-level-resistance for gentamicin (24/ 29/ 45%), streptomycin (34/ 56/ 55%) and kanamycin (41/ 68/ 55%). Increased vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were only detected in E. casseliflavus and E. gallinarum isolates (MIC range 8-24 microg/ml). The erm(B), catA, tet(M), aac(6')-aph(2''), aph(3')-IIIa, and ant(6)-Ia genes were detected in 91%, 32%, 86%, 98%, 100%, and 72% of the E. faecium and E. faecalis isolates resistant to erythromycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and high-level-resistant to gentamicin, kanamycin and streptomycin, respectively. A total of 20 unrelated pulsed-field-gel-electrophoresis patterns were found in the series of 46 high-level gentamicin-resistant E. faecalis and E. faecium isolates of this study.
TI  - Genetic diversity and antimicrobial resistance of enterococcal isolates from Southern region of Brazil.
AB  - In the present study, a total of 455 enterococcal isolates, recovered from patients living in the city of Porto Alegre, State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, during the period from July 1996 to June 1997, were identified to the species level by conventional biochemical and microbiological tests, and assayed for their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. The genetic diversity of antimicrobial resistant strains was evaluated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis of SmaI restricted chromosomal DNA. The most frequent species was Enterococcus faecalis (92.8%). Other species identified were: E. faecium (2.9%), E. gallinarum (1.5%), E. avium (1.1%), E. hirae (0.7%), E. casseliflavus (0.4%), E. durans (0.4%) and E. raffinosus (0.2%). The overall prevalence of isolates with high-level resistance (HLR) to aminoglycosides was 37.8%. HLR to gentamicin was found in 24.8%. No strains with acquired resistance to vancomycin were found. PFGE analysis showed the predominance of clonal group A, comprising strains isolated from different clinical specimens obtained from patients in three hospitals. These results suggest intra and inter-hospital dissemination of one predominant clonal group of E. faecalis isolates with HLR to gentamicin in the hospitals included in this study.
TI  - Risk factors and outcomes associated with non-Enterococcus faecalis, non-Enterococcus faecium enterococcal bacteremia.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare risk factors, clinical features, and outcomes in patients  with Enterococcus avium, Enterococcus casseliflavus, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus gallinarum, and Enterococcus mundtii bacteremia (cases) with those in patients with Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia (controls). DESIGN: A retrospective case-control study. SETTING: A 725-bed, university-affiliated, academic medical center. PATIENTS: The clinical microbiology database at Northwestern Memorial Hospital from January 1994 to May 2003 was searched to identify cases; each case was matched to one control on the basis of date of admission. RESULTS: Thirty-three cases were identified and matched with 33 controls. The mean duration of hospital stay was longer (29.7 vs 17.2 days; P = .03) and the mean time to acquisition of bacteremia was greater (16.5 vs 6.3 days; P = .003) for cases than controls. Cases were more likely to have underlying hematologic malignancies (P < .001), to have been treated with corticosteroids (P = .02), and to be neutropenic (P = .003). Controls were more likely to have an indwelling bladder catheter (P = .01), and cases were more likely to have the gastrointestinal tract as a source of infection (P = .007) and to have concurrent cholangitis (P = .002). There were no differences in severity of illness or in mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with patients with E. faecalis bacteremia, patients with non-E. faecalis, non-Enterococcus faecium enterococcal bacteremia were more likely to have a hematologic malignancy, prior treatment with corticosteroids, neutropenia, and cholangitis; longer duration of hospital stay was also identified as a clinical feature. However, non-E. faecalis, non-E. faecium species are not associated with any differences in mortality.
TI  - Partial characterization of enterocin MR99 from a corn silage isolate of Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - AIMS: To assess the inhibitory activity on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria of several species of enterococci recovered from a natural corn silage. METHODS AND RESULTS: The inhibitory activity of strains of Enterococcus faecalis (58), Enterococcus faecium (35), Enterococcus gallinarum (3) and Enterococcus casseliflavus (4) were studied employing indicator strains from various sources (clinical, food and ATCC). Enterococcus faecalis MR99, the only strain with inhibitory activity, inhibited other enterococci, Listeria spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium spp., Bacillus spp., Escherichia coli, Shigella sonnei and Shigella flexneri. The bacterium contained only one conjugative pheromone-responsive plasmid. The partially chromatography-purified MR99 enterocin (PPE) had a molecular weight of approx. 5000 Da and a pI of 6.2, was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and could be extracted in benzene and butanol. It appeared stable to adjustment of pH 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0 and was resistant to heat. Inactivation was at 15 min at 121 degrees C. Enterocin MR99 was bactericidal on strains of Listeria monocytogenes, Staph. aureus, and bovine mastitis agents, it was bacteriostatic on E. coli. Although enterocins MR99 and AS48 have inhibitory activity on Gram-negative bacilli, PCR studies demonstrated a lack of relationship between them. CONCLUSIONS: The active component had a protein nature, was resistant to heat and presented a wide inhibitory spectrum. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The biological properties of Ent. faecalis MR99 suggest that this strain merits further investigations so it can be applied in human and veterinary health programmes.
TI  - Isolation, distribution and prevalence of various species of enterococci isolated from clinical specimens in a tertiary care hospital.
AB  - Various clinical specimens were processed to find the prevalence rate of enterococci and to identify the species of clinical isolates of enterococci. Screening of various clinical specimens revealed that enterococci were prevalent in 2% of the total specimens, with urine and wound to be the major site of isolation. Conventional test scheme proposed by Facklam and Collins and commercially available systems Rapid ID 32 Strep (biomereiux) were successfully used to speciate enterococcal strains. Five species of enterococci were identified in the study from a set of 396 cultures, with E. faecalis (79.79%), and E. faecium (11.11%) predominating. E. hirae (3.03%), E. gallinarum (3.03%), and E. casseliflavus (3.03%), were the other members of Enterococcus species identified.
TI  - [Prevalence of antibiotic resistant Enterococcus spp in waste waters in the north of Chile].
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is little information available in Chile on the distribution of Enterococcus spp in waste water and its implications in transmission of antibiotic resistance through the water cycle. Enterococcus spp are common in nosocomial infections and may spread antibiotic resistance through the food chain. AIM: To determine the presence of antibiotic resistant Enterococcus spp in the sewage of Antofagasta, Chile. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Samples of sewage from two sewage treatment plants and from the Public Hospital of Antofagasta collector were obtained. Enterococcus spp were isolated on m-Enterococcus agar containing ampicillin, vancomycin and streptomycin. The isolates were identified and subjected to biochemical typing (PhPlate). Minimal inhibitory concentration determination was performed by agar dilution technique. RESULTS: High counts of resistant Enterococcus spp were found on the streptomycin plates, lower on ampicillin and very low on vancomycin plates. A total of 63 Enterococcus spp strains were typed and the identification showed 5 different species; E faecalis (65%), E faecium (14%), E hirae (13%), E durans (6%) and E gallinarum (2%). The typing revealed a high diversity among the isolates. Two biochemical phenotypes were predominant, C1 (21 strains) and C6 (7 strains). Both were highly resistant to gentamycin and streptomycin; moderately resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin, and with intermediate susceptibility to vancomycin. Both phenotypes were found in the sewage of the hospital collector and in the treatment plants. CONCLUSIONS: In the sewage of Antofagasta we found dominating phenotypes of multiresistant Enterococcus spp. Sewage could be an important way of transmission of these microorganisms.
TI  - [Identification of Enterococcus sp. isolated from raw milk samples coming from the metropolitan area of Costa Rica and evaluation of its antibiotic sensibility pattern].
AB  - Bacteria from the genus Enterococcus sp. were isolated and identified from nonpasteurized milk samples obtained from the Costa Rican Metropolitan Area, in order to evaluate its sensitivity pattern to common use antibiotics. One hundred five milk samples were collected from suppliers of a national dairy industry. The initial isolation was done in EVA (Ethyl violet agar). Isolated colonies were initially characterized phenotypically as Enterococcus sp. using biochemical tests, species' identification was done using the Api 20 Strep kit. The different Enterococci species were tested for their antibiotic sensitivity using the plate diffusion method; the minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) to vancomycin was determined using E test. 38% of the milk samples were positive for Enterococcus; 48 different strains were isolated, where E. faecalis corresponded to 71%, E. faecium to 19%, E. durans to 4%, E. gallinarum to 4% and E. avium to 2%. The geographical distribution analysis of the species isolated did not show significant statistical differences according to the origin of the samples. All isolates identified showed an important resistance rate to the antibiotics tested. The aminoglycoside family showed the lower resistance rate, the resistance to eritromicin, tetracycline and chloranphenicol was lower than 50% and all strains were sensitive to bacitracin. An 8% resistance rate to vancomycin was determined. No relationship between the resistance rate of samples and the province of origin was found, but it is important to emphasize that the strains resistant to vancomycin came from Cartago, one of the Costa Rican regions with highest milk production.
TI  - Species prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococci isolated in a  tertiary care hospital of North India.
AB  - The present prospective study was carried out to determine the species distribution and antimicrobial susceptibilities of enterococci isolated from clinical samples in a tertiary care hospital of North India. Enterococcus species isolated from blood, urine, pus, sterile fluids and the hospital environment from October 2003 to January 2004 were identified by standard biochemical tests. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the disk diffusion method as per NCCLS guidelines. Out of a total of 105 Enterococcus species recovered during the study period, E. faecium (42.90%) and E. faecalis (40.00%) constituted the predominant isolates. Enterococcus faecium was the commonest blood culture isolate while E. faecalis predominated pus and urine samples. Other species isolated were E. mundtii, E dispar, E. durans, E. avium, E. raffinosus and E. gallinarum. High-level aminoglycoside resistance was detected in 73.3% of isolates. Resistance to vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid was not detected. Prevalence of a wide variety of Enterococcus species in clinical samples together with their variable antimicrobial susceptibility patterns emphasizes the need for routinely carrying out detailed speciation and in vitro susceptibility testing of enterococcal isolates in the clinical bacteriology laboratory.
TI  - Effect of growth promotant usage on enterococci species on a poultry farm.
AB  - The species population of enterococci isolated from four poultry houses for six grow-outs on one farm was determined. Two houses on the farm were control houses and did not use any antimicrobials, while two other houses on the farm used flavomycin, virginiamycin, and bacitracin during different poultry grow-outs. Litter, chick boxliners, feed, and poultry carcass rinses were obtained from each house and cultured for the presence of enterococci. Nine species of enterococci (Enterococcusfaecalis, E. faecium, E. avium, E. casselifiavus, E. cecorum, E. durans, E. gallinarum, E. hirae, and E. malodoratus) were identified from the study. Enterococcus faecalis was isolated more frequently from chick boxliners (n=176; 92%) and carcass rinses (n=491; 69%), whereas E. faecium was found more frequently in litter (n=361; 77%) and feed (n=67; 64%). Enterococcus faecalis (n=763; 52%) and E. faecium (n=578; 39%) were isolated most often from the farm and houses, regardless of antimicrobial treatment. Fifty-two percent of E. faecalis and 39% of E. faecium were isolated from both control (n=389 and 295, respectively) and treatment (n=374 and 283, respectively) samples. This study indicates that antimicrobial usage on this farm did not alter the resident population of enterococci.
TI  - Occurrence of antibiotic resistant enterococci in clinical specimens from a pediatric hospital.
AB  - Enterococcal infection has become a major clinical problem and E. faecalis and E. faecium are the most frequently isolated species. However, the isolation of other species (E. casseliflavus, E. gallinarum, E. durans) from clinical materials was reported recently. The aim of this study was to evaluate drug resistance of 97 species of enterococci isolated from clinical specimens of Upper Silesian Health Center of Child and Mother in Katowice. Each strain was tested for susceptibility to vancomycin, teicoplanin, aminoglycosides (gentamycin and streptomycin) and synercid (quinupristine/ dalfopristine) by the E-test method. Fifty three percent of studied enterococci demonstrated high level aminoglycoside resistance (HLAR) (MIC > 1024 microg/ml). Sixty three strains of E. faecalis were sensitive to vancomycin (MIC 1-4 microg/ml), but 5 strains demonstrated low sensitivity (3 strains with MIC = 6 microg/ml and 2 strains with MIC = 24 microg/ml). All studied enterococci were sensitive to teicoplanin (MIC < 2 microg/ml). A high percentage of E. faecium (70%) resistant to synercid was demonstrated (MIC = 2-24 microg/ml). Infection control and monitoring of antibiotic sensitivity among isolated hospital strains may prevent the transmission of resistant strains in a pediatric hospital.
TI  - Virulence of Enterococcus isolates collected in Lower Silesia (Poland).
AB  - 148 enterococcal strains: E.faecalis (108), E.faecium (35), E.gallinarum (3), E.casseliflavus (1) and E.durans (1) from various clinical specimens were investigated for their ability to adhere to Caco-2 and HEp-2 cell lines, and also for the presence of the esp gene, biofilm formation, production of haemolysins, DNAse and lipase. Several types of enterococcal adhesion to both cell lines were noted. An aggregative adherence was the most frequent among E.faecalis and E.faecium isolates. Other species presented various adhesive types. The occurrence of virulence factors in the whole group of strains was as follows: esp gene in 53.4%, biofilm in 45.3%, haemolysins in 15.5%, DNAse in 12.2% and lipase in 33.1% of enterococcal isolates. It appears that the adherence of the enterococci studied was not significantly associated with the presence of virulence factors.
TI  - [VCA agar (bioMerieux) for selective isolation of vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) from fecal specimens].
AB  - Screening for Vancomycin Resistant Enterococci (VRE) is recommended for preventing nosocomial infections with VRE. The aim of this study was to assess the performance of VCA3 agar (bioMerieux) in VRE isolation from fecal specimens. 220 specimens were cultured on VCA3 agar, which contains vancomycin and in parallel, on CAP agar (Oxoid), which is vancomycin-free. 36 vancomycin resistant enterococci were isolated: 24 isolates of Enterococcus faecium expressed a high-level resistance to vancomycin and 12 isolates of E. gallinarum/casseliflavus exhibited resistance at low-level. The sensitivity of VCA3 appeared greater than that of CAP for VRE isolation: 92% (22/24) vs 79% (19/24) for E. faecium (NS, P>0.05) ; 83% (10/12) vs 50% (6/12) for E. gallinarum/casselliflavus (NS, P>0.05). As expected, initial cultures of multiple gram positive organisms were far more frequent on CAP agar than on VCA3 agar. The isolation rate of vancomycin susceptible gram positive strains was impressively lower on VCA3 medium than on CAP medium. VCA3 agar avoided therefore additional subcultures, useless identification and susceptibility tests. In conclusion, VCA3 medium could be useful for the direct, rapid and selective isolation of VRE from fecal specimens.
TI  - Characterization of glycopeptide resistant enterococci isolated from a hospital in Naples (Italy).
AB  - A study on the antibiotic resistance of enterococcal isolates (n = 280) was carried out in a teaching hospital in Naples. Strains were isolated from different sources, identified by conventional tests and their antibiotic susceptibility was tested by E-test method. Thirty-two enterococcal isolates (11.5%), phenotypically identified as E. faecium (n = 26), E. gallinarum (n = 3), E. faecalis (n = 2) and E. hirae (n = 1), showed resistance to glycopeptides. The vanA gene was found in all 32 VRE. Molecular typing was performed by RAPD analysis which showed two majors patterns.
TI  - [Clinical and epidemiologic analysis of intestinal tract colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci in an intensive care unit].
AB  - Intestinal tract colonization with vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) was studied during five months and 25 days. Out of 171 patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit, 124 (73%) were included in this study. Thirty five of them (28%) were recognized as colonized with VRE. VRE isolates (n = 35) were identified as Enterococcus faecium (n = 18), Enterococcus gallinarum (n = 16), and Enterococcus raffinosus (n = 1). All of them were resistant to vancomycin (MIC90 = 512 microg/ml) and to teicoplanin (MIC90 = 32 microg/ml), having the vanA gene. By means of molecular methods a high homology was found among E. faecium and E. gallinarum isolates, respectively, suggesting their spread as a kind of outbreak. No significant differences in age or sex were found among colonized and non-colonized patients (p > 0.05). On the other hand, the hospitalization time and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics were associated with colonization. From this study we highlight the importance of enhancing all measures of control and prevention of hospital infections, carefully analyzing the empiric antimicrobial schemes, trying to reduce the hospital stage, and following the surveillance to evaluate the efficacy of such procedures.
TI  - [Microbiological external quality assurance program (MEQAP)--evaluation of results obtained in sanitary epidemiological laboratories in 2002].
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate reliability of identification and determination of sensitivity to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics of some Gram positive cocci strains in 34 sanitary-epidemiological stations. All laboratories engaged in this study received 3 strains: S. aureus (S. aureus SC+ CF+, resistant to methicillin., or S. aureus SC - CF+, sensitive to methicillin), coagulase-negative staphylococci (S. epidermidis or S. haemolyticus or S. saprophyticus) and Enterococcus sp. (E. faecalis HLAR-positive or E. faecalis HLAR-negative or E. faecium or E. gallinarum). All these strains previously were identified in Department of Bacteriology of National Institute of Hygiene. Of the 68 staphylococci strains tested, 66 isolates were correctly identified. Among the 34 enterococcal strains studied the greatest difficulty in identification was caused by E. gallinarum strain--(8 out of 13 strains were incorrectly recognised). The determination of the sensitivity of the control strains to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents, generally was performed correctly in accordance with to the NCCLS and national recommendations. Some incorrect results of the antibiograms were caused by an erroneous interpretation of the zones of inhibition.
TI  - [Prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in hospital and community environment.]
AB  - Aim of the study: The presented study aimed at determining the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in rectal swabs taken from both patients in the Teaching Hospital in Olomouc (THO), Czech Republic, and subjects from the community setting of the hospital's catchment area. Materials and methods: Between July 1, 2002 and July 1, 2003, rectal swabs were taken from the THO patients as well as individuals from the community catchment area to be utilized for isolating and identifying enterococci and their suscetibility to antibiotics. Vancomycin resistance phenotypes were verified by PCR detection of vanA, vanB, vanC1 and vanC2 genes. A molecular biology analysis was performed in VanA Enterococcus faecium strains. To determine the relationship of strains, macrorestriction analysis of the total chromosomal DNA digested with SmaI restriction endonuclease was used. Results: During the observed period, 2,157 rectal swabs from the hospitalized patients and 4,874 rectal swabs from the subjects in community setting were examined. In total, 27 VRE of hospital origin and 13 community-population strains were isolated. The prevalence of VRE in the gastrointestinal tract was 2.3 % in the hospitalized patients and 0.6 % in the community subjects. The prevailing strains were Enterococcus faecium VanA (70.4 %) in the VRE of hospital origin and Enterococcus gallinarum VanC (46.2 %) in the community VRE. Mutual comparison between the hospital and community VRE showed no similarity. Conclusion: In the Czech Republic, VRE were proved both in community and hospital settings. Their prevalence in rectal swabs is low and does not exceed the values reported in other European countries. The author describes the chief characteristics of the most important quinolone antibiotics, including preparations either in their development stage or whose development has been prematurely interrupted because of adverse side-effects. The list includes all preparations that are or were temporarily registered in the Czech Republic.
TI  - Prevalence and molecular epidemiology of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) strains isolated from animals and humans in Korea.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To assess the possibility of VRE transmission from animals to humans, we studied the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in farm animals, raw chicken meat, and healthy people. We then determined the molecular relatedness of VRE isolates between animals and humans in Korea. METHODS: We aimed to isolate VRE from 150 enterococci specimens of farm animals, 15 raw chicken meat samples, and stools from 200 healthy people. Species differentiation was done with conventional biochemical tests. Vancomycin resistance genotyping was done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Using the agar dilution method, antimicrobial susceptibility was tested for 8 antimicrobials and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was done to evaluate the molecular relatedness of VRE isolates. RESULTS: The prevalence of VRE was 14.7% (22/150) in farm animal specimens, 1% (2/200) in healthy people, and 60% (9/15) in raw chicken meat. Of 22 animal VRE isolates, 1 vanA E. faecium, 15 vanC1 E. gallinarum, and 6 vanC2 E. casseliflavus were identified. All of the 9 VRE from raw chicken meat and all of the 20 clinical VRE strains were vanA E. faecium. However, in healthy people, only 2 vanC2 E. casseliflavus were isolated. These showed low-level resistance to vancomycin and susceptibility to teicoplanin. However, 9 VRE strains from raw chicken meat had high-level resistance to vancomycin (MIC(50,90): >128 microg/mL), teicoplanin (MIC(50,90): >128 microg/mL), ampicillin (MIC(50,90): >128 nicrog/mL), erythromycin (MIC(50.90): >128 microg/mL), and tetracycline (MIC(50/90): 128/>128 microg/mL). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated little evidence of VRE colonization in healthy people despite high recovery of VRE among raw chicken meat. It is suggested that there is little evidence of VRE transmission from animals to healthy people. However, we assumed that there exists the possibility of VRE contamination during the processing of chicken meat.
TI  - Contribution of enterococci to the spread of antibiotic resistance in the production chain of swine meat commodities.
AB  - Thirty-six samples, including fecal specimens, dry feedstuffs, raw and processed  pork meat products, and dry fermented sausages, were collected from two production chains of swine meat commodities and analyzed for the presence of 11 antibiotic resistance (AR) genes. Specific PCR assays carried out on DNA extracted directly from the samples revealed a high incidence of the genes tet(K) (80.5%), ermB (66.7%), and tet(M) (66.7%). Feces and feedstuffs gave the largest number of positive amplifications. To elucidate the contribution of enterococci to the occurrence and spread of AR, 146 resistant enterococci were isolated, and their identity, genetic fingerprints, and AR gene profiles were determined by means of molecular techniques. Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium were the predominant isolated species (43.8 and 38.4%, respectively); Other Enterococcus species identified were E. durans (8.9%), E. hirae (2.7%), E. gallinarum (2.1%), E. mundtii (2.1%), and E. casseliflavus (2.1%). A number of isolates displayed a complex AR gene profile comprising up to four different resistance determinants. The genes tet(M) and ermB were highly diffused, being present in 86.9 and 84.9%, respectively, of the isolates. The application of amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting was particularly valuable to monitor the resistant enterococcal isolates along the production chain and to individuate steps in which contamination might occur. In fact, isolates of E. faecalis and E. faecium showing the same amplified fragment length polymorphism profile and AR gene pattern were detected in samples taken at different steps of the food chain suggesting three cases of bacterial clonal spread.
TI  - Genetic diversity and safety aspects of enterococci from slightly fermented sausages.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the biodiversity of enterococci from slightly fermented sausages (chorizo and fuet) at species and strain level by molecular typing, while considering their safety aspects. METHODS AND RESULTS: Species-specific PCR and partial sequencing of 16S rRNA and sodA genes were used to identify enterococcal population. Enterococcus faecium was the most frequently isolated species followed by E. faecalis, E. hirae and E. durans. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR revealed species-specific clusters and allowed strain typing. Sixty strains of 106 isolates exhibited different RAPD profiles indicating a high genetic variability. All the E. faecalis strains carried virulence genes (efaAfs, esp, agg and gelE) and all E. faecium isolates carried efaAfm gene. Enterococcus faecalis showed higher antibiotic resistance than the other species. Only one E. faecium strain showed vanA genotype (high-level resistance to glycopeptides) and E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus/flavescens isolates showed vanC1 and vanC2/C3 genotypes (low-level resistance only to vancomycin) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: E. faecalis has been mainly associated with virulence factors and antimicrobial multi-resistance and, although potential risk for human health is low, the presence of this species in slightly fermented sausages should be avoided to obtain high quality products. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The enterococcal population of slightly fermented sausages has been thoroughly characterized. Several relevant safety aspects have been revealed.
TI  - Emergence of unusual species of enterococci causing infections, South India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enterococci tend to be one of the leading causes of nosocomial infections, with E. faecalis and E. faecium accounting up to 90% of the clinical isolates. Nevertheless, the incidence of other species of enterococci from clinical sources shows an alarming increase with the properties of intrinsic resistance to several antibiotics including beta-lactams and glycopeptides. Thus proper identification of enterococci to species level is quintessential for management and prevention of these bacteria in any healthcare facility. Hence this work was undertaken to study the prevalence of unusual species of enterococci causing human infections, in a tertiary care hospital in South India. METHODS: The study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in South India from July 2001 to June 2003. Isolates of enterococci were collected from various clinical specimens and speciated using extensive phenotypic and physiological tests. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed and interpreted as per NCCLS guidelines. Whole cell protein (WCP) fingerprinting of enterococci were done for species validation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and analyzed computationally. RESULTS: Our study showed the prevalence of unusual (non-faecalis and non-faecium enterococci) and atypical (biochemical variant) species of enterococci as 19% (46 isolates) and 5% (12 isolates) respectively. The 7 unusual species (46 isolates) isolated and confirmed by phenotypic characterization includes: 15 E. gallinarum (6.2%), 10 E. avium (4.1%), 6 E. raffinosus (2.5%), 6 E. hirae (2.5%), 4 E. mundtii (1.7%), 3 E. casseliflavus-including the two atypical isolates (1.2%) and 2 E. durans (0.8%). The 12 atypical enterococcal species (5%) that showed aberrant sugar reactions in conventional phenotyping were confirmed as E. faecalis, E. faecium and E. casseliflavus respectively by WCP fingerprinting. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing depicted the emergence of high-level aminoglycoside and beta-lactam resistance among different species apart from intrinsic vancomycin resistance by some species, while all the species tested were susceptible for linezolid and teicoplanin. CONCLUSION: Our study reveals the emergence of multi-drug resistance among unusual species of enterococci posing a serious therapeutic challenge. Precise identification of enterococci to species level enables us to access the species-specific antimicrobial resistance characteristics, apart from knowing the epidemiological pattern and their clinical significance in human infections.
TI  - Determination of antibiotic resistance and resistance plasmids of clinical Enterococcus species.
AB  - To determine the antibiotic resistance pattern and resistance plasmids, we studied 23 antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates of Enterococcus spp. which caused infection in Bayindir-Ankara Hospital, Turkey. Biochemical and physiological identification tests were applied by the Vitek system and compared with the results of protein profiles by SDS-PAGE. From 23 isolates, 20 were identified as E. faecalis, 2 as E. faecium and 1 as E. gallinarum. Twenty four antibiotics belong to 10 different groups were used in susceptibility tests. Multiple antibiotic resistance was determined in 10 of 23 Enterococcus spp. Overall resistance to the used antibiotics was 47.3% and low level resistance was 16.6%. Among the isolates tested, 8.7% demonstrated high level gentamicin resistance, 17.4% demonstrated high level streptomycin resistance, and 43.5% demonstrated penicillin resistance. High level vancomycin resistant Enterococcus spp. rate was 34.8%, and 60.9% exhibited low level resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin. They contain plasmids which varied in numbers between 1 and 11 and the plasmid sizes ranged from 2.08 to 56.15 kb. In curing experiments with acriflavine, two different plasmids were shown in different molecular sizes of 33.49 and 13.6 kb while the first determined glycopeptide and penicillin resistance, the second one determined either glycopeptide or penicillin resistance in two different E. faecalis strains. On the other hand, a 22.58 kb plasmid, determining kanamycin resistance, was detected in an E. faecium strain. After the curing experiments, an elimination of 37.17 and 44.47 kDa protein bands was shown in E. faecium EFA1 and E. faecalis EFA13 in SDS-PAGE, respectively. This survey indicates the increase of antibiotic-resistant enterococci, especially to vancomycin in our hospital isolates.
TI  - Molecular-biological analysis of vancomycin-resistant enterococci isolated from a community in the Czech Republic.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the occurrence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE)  in a community of the Czech Republic and a molecular-biological analysis of the VRE isolated. METHODS: Enterococci were isolated from the rectal swabs of healthy people in the Olomouc region (population 300,000), Czech Republic in the period of January-December 2003. The molecular-biological analysis of VRE was performed by analysis of isolated DNA, which was cleaved by restriction enzyme SmaI and separated by pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS: A total number of 5,283 swabs were evaluated and 558 Enterococcus sp. strains were isolated during the follow-up period. 9 strains (1.6%) were identified as VRE. Two strains were E. faecium phenotype VanA, one strain was E. faecalis phenotype VanB, two strains were E. gallinarum phenotype VanC and four strains were E. casseliflavus phenotype VanC. PFGE was used to obtain 9 different restriction profiles of VRE strains. The analysis showed closer a similarity of E. casseliflavus strains (80-95%) than between E. faecium strains (41%). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of VRE in a sample community of the Czech population was confirmed. It is clear that it is necessary to take into account the possibility of VRE spreading from the community into health care facilities.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of Enterococcus sp. isolated from the intestinal tract of patients from a university hospital in Brazil.
AB  - This study reports the results about antimicrobial resistance of Enterococcus spp. isolated from intestinal tract of patients from a university hospital in Brazil. The identification of strains at species level was performed by conventional biochemical tests, API 20 Strep (bioMerieux), and polymerase chain reaction assay. The species distribution was E. faecium (34%), followed by E. faecalis (33%), E. gallinarum (23.7%), E. casseliflavus (5.2%), E. avium (1%), and E. hirae (1%). Intrinsic resistance to vancomycin characterized by presence of vanC genes was found in E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus. The high prevalence of VanC phenotype enterococci is very important because these species have been reported as causing a wide variety of infections. Vancomycin-resistant E. faecium or E. faecalis were not found and no one isolate of these species was a beta-lactamase producer. Thirteen clinical isolates of enterococci (13.4%) showed multiresistance patterns, which were defined by resistance to three classes of antibiotics plus resistance to at least one aminoglycoside (gentamicin and/or streptomycin). The resistance to several antimicrobials shown by enterococcal strains obtained in this study is of concern because of the decrease in the therapeutic options for treatment of infections caused by enterococci.
TI  - Identification of clinically relevant enterococcus species by direct sequencing of groES and spacer region.
AB  - We determined the groESL sequences (groES, groEL, and the intergenic spacer) of 10 clinically relevant Enterococcus species and evaluated the feasibility of identifying Enterococcus species on the basis of these sequences. Seven common clinical Enterococcus species, E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. casseliflavus, E. gallinarum, E. avium, E. raffinosus, and E. hirae, and three less common Enterococcus species, E. cecorum, E. durans, and E. mundtii, were examined in this study. We found that the groES genes of these enterococcal species are identical in length (285 nucleotides) and contain an unusual putative start codon, GTG. The lengths and sequences of the intergenic regions (spacers between the groES and groEL genes) are quite variable (17 to 57 bp in length) among Enterococcus species but are conserved in strains within each species, with only a few exceptions. Considerable variation of groES or groEL sequences was also observed. The evolutionary trees of groES or groEL sequences revealed similarities among Enterococcus species. However, the overall intraspecies variation of groES was less than that of groEL. The high interspecies variation and low intraspecies variation indicate that the groES and spacer sequences are more useful than groEL for identification of clinically relevant Enterococcus species. The sequences of these two genetic traits, groES and spacer, can be determined by a single PCR and direct sequencing and may provide important information for the differentiation of closely related species of Enterococcus.
TI  - Enterococci spp. isolated from Cuba: species frequency of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility profile.
AB  - This study investigated the species distribution and antimicrobial resistance among 99 enterococci isolated from hospitalized patients in 12 hospitals in Cuba from October 2000 to September 2001. Species identification was performed by WIDER Automatic System (Francisco Soria Melguizo, Madrid, Spain), and the susceptibility testing was performed by disk diffusion, agar dilution, and E-test methods. Enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent (85%) species, followed by E. faecium (10%), E. gallinarum (2%), E. casseliflavus (2%), and E. durans-hirae (1%). A higher percentage of resistance to ampicillin (50%), fosfomycin (40%), ciprofloxacin (30%), norfloxacin (20%), and tetracycline (90%) was detected in E. faecium isolates, whereas E. faecalis strains showed higher rates of resistance to erythromycin (52.4%), chloramphenicol (34.5%), rifampicin (62.5%), moxifloxacin (3%), and nitrofurantoin (2.4%). Resistance to glycopeptide was detected in E. faecalis (1.2%) and E. faecium (10%). Thirty-one E. faecalis (37%) and 3 E. faecium (30%) showed a high-level resistance to gentamicin. The results of this work will be very helpful to guide empirical antimicrobial therapy and the implementation of infection control measures in Cuban hospitals.
TI  - Drug resistance in fecal enterococci in Hong Kong.
AB  - Our purpose was to estimate the rate of carriage of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in hospitalized patients in a district hospital and in healthy subjects in the community in Hong Kong. Rectal swabs were collected from all patients admitted to the intensive care unit, and stool specimens were collected from all patients presenting with suspected antibiotic-associated diarrhea over a 2-month period. Stool specimens were also collected from healthy subjects in the community. Specimens were enriched and cultured on selective media for the isolation of enterococci. All isolates were identified, and their minimum inhibitory concentration for vancomycin was determined. Susceptibility to other antibiotics was investigated. Samples yielded 125 isolates of enterococci, the majority of isolates being Enterococcus faecalis (75) and E. faecium (35). Nine of 11 strains of E. gallinarum and 2 of 2 strains of E. casseliflavus isolated from hospitalized patients were intermediately resistant to vancomycin, but no strains highly resistant to vancomycin were isolated. Resistance to other drugs, including the fluoroquinolones, was present, and a high-level resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin was found in 37% and 46% of strains, respectively. Colonization with VRE remains low in Hong Kong. This result is supported by the low level of isolation of VRE from infections in the region and may be attributable to low levels of vancomycin use. High-level aminoglycoside resistance and fluoroquinolone resistance are common, and continued monitoring for VRE is suggested.
TI  - Vancomycin resistance, esp, and strain relatedness: a 1-year study of enterococcal bacteremia.
AB  - The prevalence of esp, a gene associated with infection-derived and outbreak strains, in enterococcal blood isolates from 2002 was determined. Fifty-five of 137 (40.1%) Enterococcus faecalis isolates, 30 of 58 (51.7%) E. faecium isolates, 1 of 1 E. raffinosus isolate, 0 of 4 E. gallinarum isolates, and 0 of 1 E. casseliflavus isolate were positive. esp wasn't associated with vancomycin resistance (VR) or clinical service. VR E. faecium isolates were less genetically diverse than vancomycin-susceptible strains. A large cluster of VR isolates, belonging to esp-positive E. faecium, was revealed. These data support the hypothesis that esp and VR may contribute to dissemination of particular clones.
TI  - Emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in a tertiary hospital in Crete, Greece: a cluster of cases and prevalence study on intestinal colonisation.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of five consecutive cases of infection with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and the prevalence of faecal carriage of VRE among patients admitted to a 700-bed university hospital where no VRE had been isolated previously. In a 2-month period, five consecutive patients infected with VRE were detected. Three VanB+ Enterococcus faecium isolates were obtained from three patients, while two VanA+ E. faecium isolates, one VanA+ Enterococcus faecalis isolate and one VanC1+ Enterococcus gallinarum isolate were obtained from the other two patients. Of 218 faecal specimens from all hospital wards, 41 (18.8%) were found to contain VRE. Forty-two isolates of VRE were obtained, comprising one (2%) E. faecalis, 11 (27%) E. faecium, 24 (57%) E. gallinarum and six (14%) Enterococcus casseliflavus/flavescens. Four isolates carried the vanA gene, eight carried vanB, 24 carried vanC1, and six carried vanC2/C3. Use of glycopeptides, the presence of central venous catheters and renal dialysis all correlated with VRE colonisation. The prevalence rates were among the highest reported in the literature.
TI  - Enterococcus gallinarum carrying the vanA gene cluster: first report in Brazil.
AB  - In 2000, Enterococcus faecalis resistant to vancomycin was first reported at a tertiary hospital in Porto Alegre, southern Brazil. The resistance spread to other hospitals and surveillance programs were established by hospital infection committees to prevent the spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. In February 2002, an isolate initially identified at the genus level as Enterococcus was obtained by surveillance culture (rectal swab) from a patient admitted to a hospital for treatment of septic arthritis in the shoulder. The isolate proved to be resistant to vancomycin by the disc diffusion method and confirmed by an E-test resulting in a minimal inhibitory concentration of > or = 256 microg/ml. This isolate was sent to a reference laboratory (Laboratorio Especial de Bacteriologia e Epidemiologia Molecular, Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas de Ribeirao Preto, USP) for further study and proved to be an E. gallinarum by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers for the species. Due to the phenotype of unusually high vancomycin resistance, the isolate presumably had the resistance genes (vanA and vanB) and this was confirmed by PCR, which indicated the presence of the vanA gene. A 10.8-kb Tn1546-related transposon was also identified by long-PCR. Interspecies transfer of the vancomycin-resistance gene from the donor E. gallinarum was performed in a successful conjugation experiment in vitro, using E. faecium GE-1 and E. faecalis JH22 as receptors. This is the first report of the detection of a vanA determinant naturally acquired by E. gallinarum in Brazil, indicating the importance of characterizing VRE by both phenotype and genotype methods.
TI  - [Antibiotic susceptibility analysis of Enterococcus spp. isolated from urine].
AB  - Recently increase of enterococcal infections has been observed. These bacteria, mainly Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium are members of the normal flora of gastrointestinal tract but also are typical opportunistic pathogens. Enterococci are characterized by natural resistance to numerous antibiotics (among them cephalosporins), and also by easy acquired resistance to antibiotics. Infections caused by multiresistant strains are difficult in treatment, chronic, recurrent and sometimes fatal are described. Enterococcal infections are caused often by E. faecalis, rarely by E. faecium. In the last years other species of enterococci have been isolated from different clinical materials (E. casseliflavus, E. avium, E. durans, E. gallinarum). The aim of this study was to analyze the antibiotics susceptibility of Enterococcus spp. isolated from urine of children with urinary tract infection (UTI), hospitalized in the Upper Silesian Health Center of Child and Mother or treated ambulatory. Susceptibility of the 130 strains of E. faecalis and 41 E. faecium to: penicillin, tetracycline, high level of aminoglycoside (gentamycin 120 microg and streptomycin 300 microg), glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin), ciprofloxacin and nitrofurantoin was estimated. All isolated strains of E. faecalis (100%) were sensitive to glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin) and to nitrofurantoin, 96% strains were sensitive to penicillin, 43% to ciprofloxacin and 28% to tetracycline. All strains of E. faecium were sensitive to glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin), 32% strains were sensitive to penicillin, 19% to tetracycline 14% to ciprofloxacin and 50% to nitrofurantoin. Twenty two strains of E. faecalis (17%) and twelve strains of E. faecium (29%) were demonstrated high level resistance to aminoglycosides (HLAR). Among HLAR strains of enterococci, were observed strains of high level resistance only to streptomycin, high level resistance only to gentamycin and high level resistance to both aminoglycosides. The HLAR strains of E. faecalis and E. faecium were also resistant to other antibiotics: penicillin, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. The most frequent cause of child urinary tract infection was E. faecalis, with high sensitivity to penicillins, glycopeptides and nitrofurantoin. The increased role of E. faecium and other strains of enterococci also has been shown. These species demonstrated sensitivity to glycopeptides, but resistance to other antibiotics, routinely used for treatment of UTI as well as to nitrofurantoin.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology and antimicrobial susceptibility of Enterococci recovered  from Brazilian intensive care units.
AB  - We studied the antimicrobial resistance and the molecular epidemiology of 99 enterococcal surveillance isolates from two hospitals of Brasilia, Brazil. Conventional biochemical tests were used to identify the enterococcal species and the disk diffusion method was used to determine their resistance profiles. Enterococcus faecalis (76%) and E. faecium (9%) were the most prevalent species. No enterococci showed the vanA or vanB vancomycin resistance phenotypes or genotypes. Only the intrinsically resistant species E. gallinarum (n=2) and E. casseliflavus (n=3) harbored the vancomycin-resistance genes vanC1 and vanC2/3, respectively. We found E. faecalis isolates with high-level resistance to gentamicin (22%) and streptomycin (8%) and both E. faecalis and E. faecium isolates with resistance to more than two antimicrobials (84% and 67%, respectively). Nine E. faecalis isolates (12%) were resistant to ampicillin; the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were 16 microg/mL (n=6) and 32 microg/mL (n=3). Among these ampicillin-resistant E. faecalis, seven were also resistant to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, rifampin, penicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and erythromycin. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis classified those isolates in three different genotypes, suggesting dissemination of genetically related ampicillin-resistant E. faecalis strains among different patients.
TI  - Evaluation of the prevalence and risk factors for colonization by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus among patients on dialysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) has been reported among long-term dialysis patients, although risk factors for VRE colonization are not well defined. This study aims to appraise the prevalence and risk factors for VRE colonization among patients on long-term dialysis therapy, as well as the mechanisms for dissemination of vancomycin resistance. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional survey of 320 patients on long-term dialysis therapy at 2 hospitals of the Federal University of Sao Paulo from June 2001 to March 2003. Fecal samples were collected from each patient once a week for 1 month. Samples with positive test results for VRE were submitted to molecular typing through automated ribotyping. RESULTS: VRE prevalence was 14.4%. There were significant associations between VRE and dialysis type (hemodialysis, P = 0.04), number of hospitalizations (P = 0.03), low hemoglobin level (P = 0.03), and leukocytosis (P = 0.05). Among samples with VRE (n = 56), 25% were Enterococcus faecium; 10.7%, Enterococcus casseliflavus; 57.1%, Enterococcus gallinarum; and 3.6%, Enterococcus faecalis. All samples isolated were sensitive to teicoplanin, except for E faecium samples, which were strongly resistant, although 9 of 14 patients with this isolate presented the same ribogroup (111-S-4). Typing of 6 samples from 8 dialysis patients with E gallinarum was performed, showing a predominant ribogroup (112-S-4). CONCLUSION: Hospital environment, hemodialysis, anemia, and leukocytosis appear to be associated with VRE colonization. These results suggest that dissemination of these bacteria among patients on long-term dialysis therapy may be taking place.
TI  - Lack of correlation between phenotypic techniques and PCR-based genotypic methods for identification of Enterococcus spp.
AB  - A total of 123 genetically-unrelated strains of Enterococcus spp. strains (51 Enterococcus faecalis, 57 Enterococcus faecium, 10 Enterococcus gallinarum, and 5 Enterococcus casseliflavus) were phenotypically identified by biochemical profiles and by using an automated method. The strains were also analyzed by a PCR assay to assess the accuracy of the phenotypically-based methods for identification of Enterococcus spp. With this aim, a PCR assay using different cell targets, which allows simultaneous detection of glycopeptide-resistant genotypes as well as identification to the species level by means of different gene targets, was used as the gold standard method. All 51 strains of E. faecalis were correctly identified, whereas 48 of 57 strains (84.2%) of E. faecium, were correctly identified. All of the strains of E. gallinarum and 3 out of 5 strains of E. casseliflavus were also correctly identified. The overall results showed that it is possible to identify Enterococcus spp. at the molecular level in less than 30 hours, compared with the 48-96 hours required for the phenotypically-based methods. The excellent accuracy of the PCR assay in identifying these species, particularly E. faecium, must also be emphasized. These findings may have implications for the routine clinical identification of enterococci species.
TI  - Molecular study of vancomycin-resistant enterococci isolated from humans and from food in a cattle-rearing area of France.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Study possible links between vancomycin-resistant enterococci strains isolated from human stool samples and from pork or poultry food products. METHODS: One hundred and eleven vancomycin-resistant enterococci strains (15 VanA and 96 VanC) were isolated from human stool samples and from pork or poultry food products. Characterization of the Tn1546-like element of the 15 VanA strains was realized by restriction analysis of PCR products and polymorphism study. The 96 strains of VanC phenotype (75 Enterococcus gallinarum and 21 Enterococcus casseliflavus) were analysed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS: In the study described here, polymorphism of the Tn1546-like element enabled the establishment of five groups. Groups III, IV and V were found only in human strains. Groups I and II were found to occur in strains isolated from humans and from food, suggesting a possible transfer of the Tn1546-like element. The isolates from Group I harboured the whole Tn1546 element. In Group II, the five strains possessed a novel Tn1546-like element, characterized by a single-nucleotide difference in the vanX gene and a deletion upstream from the nucleotide 164. Analysis by PFGE of the 75 E. gallinarum strains revealed 20 different patterns. One pattern was shared by isolates from pork food and human samples. None of the 21 E. casseliflavus strains tested was found to share similar PFGE patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Results tend to support the possible transfer of the Tn1546-like element between strains of VanA phenotype. Concerning VanC phenotype strains, the transfer was not demonstrated.
TI  - Substantially increased faecal carriage of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in a  tertiary Greek hospital after a 4 year time interval.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In a tertiary Greek hospital with no documented vancomycin-resistant  enterococci (VRE) infections, a cross-sectional study was conducted in order to determine the degree of VRE faecal carriage among adult patients hospitalized in high-risk units. METHODS: Specimens for the surveillance were collected from separate patients in two periods (January-May 1999 and January-May 2003); 258 specimens were submitted during the first period and 149 during the second period. RESULTS: Three patients (1.2%) were colonized with VRE during the first period, whereas 52 (34.9%) were colonized during the second period. Two VRE isolates of the first period were Enterococcus faecalis and one Enterococcus faecium, whereas those of the second period were E. faecium except for three E. faecalis and two Enterococcus gallinarum. All VRE isolates apart from the two E. gallinarum isolates were positive for the vanA gene. The 48 vancomycin-resistant E. faecium were classified into eight clonal types, one of those predominating with 29 isolates; the remaining included one to nine isolates. The five vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis formed four distinct clonal types. CONCLUSIONS: The study reports a substantially higher prevalence of VRE carriage when the surveillance was repeated after a 4 year time interval. Urgent infection control measures are needed to prevent emergence of VRE outbreaks in our hospital setting.
TI  - Prevalence and molecular characterization of tetracycline resistance in Enterococcus isolates from food.
AB  - In the present study, a collection of 187 Enterococcus food isolates mainly originating from European cheeses were studied for the phenotypic and genotypic assessment of tetracycline (TC) resistance. A total of 45 isolates (24%) encompassing the species Enterococcus faecalis (n = 33), E. durans (n = 7), E. faecium (n = 3), E. casseliflavus (n = 1), and E. gallinarum (n = 1) displayed phenotypic resistance to TC with MIC ranges of 16 to 256 microg/ml. Eight of these strains exhibited multiresistance to TC, erythromycin, and chloramphenicol. By PCR detection, TC resistance could be linked to the presence of the tet(M) (n = 43), tet(L) (n = 16), and tet(S) (n = 1) genes. In 15 isolates, including all of those for which the MIC was 256 micro g/ml, both tet(M) and tet(L) were found. Furthermore, all tet(M)-containing enterococci also harbored a member of the Tn916-Tn1545 conjugative transposon family, of which 12 erythromycin-resistant isolates also contained the erm(B) gene. Filter mating experiments revealed that 10 E. faecalis isolates, 3 E. durans isolates, and 1 E. faecium isolate could transfer either tet(M), tet(L), or both of these genes to E. faecalis recipient strain JH2-2. In most cases in which only tet(M) was transferred, no detectable plasmids were acquired by JH2-2 but instead all transconjugants contained a member of the Tn916-Tn1545 family. Sequencing analysis of PCR amplicons and evolutionary modeling showed that a subset of the transferable tet(M) genes belonged to four sequence homology groups (SHGs) showing an internal homology of > or = 99.6%. Two of these SHGs contained tet(M) mosaic structures previously found in Tn916 elements and on Lactobacillus and Neisseria plasmids, respectively, whereas the other two SHGs probably represent new phylogenetic lineages of this gene.
TI  - Virulence factors and in vitro adherence of Enterococcus strains to urinary catheters.
AB  - The ability to adhere in vitro to urinary catheters and the presence of enterococcal virulence factors was determined in 30 Enterococcus urinary isolates (12 E. faecalis, 12 E. faecium, 3 E. casseliflavus, 3 E. gallinarum). Silicone, siliconized latex and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were examined by sonication quantitative culture technique and scanning electron microscope. As compared to E. faecalis and E. faecium, E. casseliflavus and E. gallinarum displayed lower adhesion to all synthetic materials. All the tests performed showed higher adherence of all tested strains to siliconized latex and silicone than to PVC. Biofilmforming ability was observed in 5 E. faecalis but in none of the remaining strains. The gene coding enterococcal surface protein (Esp) was detected in 7 E. faecalis and 6 E. faecium strains. Gelatinase was found in 1 E. faecalis, 2 E. faecium and hemolysins were found in 6 E. faecalis and 1 E. faecium strains. All E. casseliflavus and E. gallinarum strainswere negative for these traits. Hydrophobic type of cell surface (measured by its affinity for n-hexadecane) was shown in a few isolates. Bacterial adherence was not significantly associated with the above pathogenic factors.
TI  - Analysis of gyrA and parC mutations in enterococci from environmental samples with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin.
AB  - The quinolone resistance determining regions of gyrA and parC in four species of  enterococci from environmental samples with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin were sequenced. The nucleotide sequence variations of parC could be related to the different enterococcal species. Mutations in Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium related to reduced susceptibility were identical to mutations detected in E. faecalis and E. faecium of clinical origin. A minimal inhibitory concentration of 8 microg ml(-1) to ciprofloxacin was not associated with any mutations in the gyrA and parC gene of Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus gallinarum. These two species may be intrinsically less susceptible to ciprofloxacin.
TI  - In vitro activity of daptomycin against vancomycin-resistant enterococci of various Van types and comparison of susceptibility testing methods.
AB  - The increasing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) infections and the limited number of antimicrobial agents for their treatment emphasize a need for new, more effective agents. In this study, the in vitro activity of daptomycin was determined against a collection of 156 VRE from seven different institutions. Van types were characterized by PCR, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was performed to exclude isolates with >85% relatedness by dendrogram. Included were 126 Enterococcus faecium (109 vanA, 17 vanB) isolates, 5 Enterococcus faecalis (3 vanA, 2 vanB) isolates, 2 Enterococcus avium (vanA) isolates, 1 Enterococcus durans (vanA) isolate, 10 Enterococcus gallinarum (vanC1) isolates, and 12 Enterococcus casseliflavus (vanC2) isolates. MICs of daptomycin and five additional agents were determined by the NCCLS broth microdilution method with Mueller-Hinton (MH) broth containing supplemental calcium. MICs were also determined using two investigational E-test strip formulations, and disk diffusion testing was performed by the standard NCCLS method. The MIC of daptomycin at which 50% of the isolates tested were inhibited for this isolate collection was 4 microg/ml, and the MIC at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited was 8 microg/ml. Two isolates of vanA E. faecium were resistant to linezolid, and one isolate was resistant to quinupristin-dalfopristin. MICs of daptomycin determined by the E test with and without added calcium varied by 8- to 16-fold, and disk diffusion zones varied by 3 to 6 mm according to the calcium content of the commercial MH agar lots used in the study. This study has shown daptomycin to have good activity against a diverse collection of contemporary VRE isolates. However, improved standardization of the calcium content of MH agar will be important for reliable testing of daptomycin by clinical laboratories using either the E test or disk diffusion methods.
TI  - Intestinal colonization by vanA- or vanB2-containing enterococcal isolates of healthy animals in Spain.
AB  - Fecal samples of healthy animals (66 pigs, 22 pets) recovered during 1998 in La Rioja, Spain, were analyzed for vancomycin-resistant enterococci colonization. Vancomycin resistance mechanisms were analyzed by PCR and sequencing. vanA-containing enterococci were detected in 3 of 66 samples (4.5%) and 5 of 22 samples (22.7%) of the pig and pet samples, respectively. Seven unrelated pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns were detected among the 8 vanA isolates (7 Enterococcus faecium, 1 E. faecalis). The tet(M) gene was present in all eight vanA enterococcal isolates, while the erm(B) and aac(6')-Ie-aph(2")-Ia genes were detected in 6 and 3 isolates, respectively. Colonization by vanC-1-containing enterococci (E. gallinarum) was demonstrated in 3% and 4.5% of the pig and pet samples. The aac(6')-Ie-aph(2")-Ia, ant(6)-Ia, aph(3')-IIIa, erm(B) and tet(M) genes were identified in one of the E. gallinarum isolates from a pig fecal sample. One vanB2-containing E. hirae strain was detected in the fecal sample of a healthy pig. In this isolate, the vanB2 gene cluster was integrated into the Tn5382-like element, as demonstrated by specific PCRs and sequencing. The tet(M) and erm(B) genes were also detected in this isolate. This is the first report in which a vanB2-containing enterococci is detected in animals and in E. hirae.
TI  - Species distribution and antibiotic resistance patterns of enterococci isolated from food of animal origin in Germany.
AB  - Presently, enterococci take the third place of bacterial pathogens associated with nosocomial infections, after staphylococci and Escherichia coli. Especially, the resistances of enterococci to several available antibiotics are threatening. We attempted to determine which species of enterococci could be found in food of animal origin and their significance according to their antibiotic resistances for human beings. From November 2000 to May 2002 we investigated 155 samples of food of animal origin bought in retail outlets in Germany: 27 samples of sausages, 19 of ham, 83 of minced meat, 26 of cheese. From these food samples we isolated 416 enterococcal strains. The most frequent species was Enterococcus faecalis (299 strains); furthermore, we found Enterococcus faecium (54 strains), Enterococcus durans together with Enterococcus hirae (24 strains), Enterococcus casseliflavus (22 strains), Enterococcus avium (9 strains) and Enterococcus gallinarum (8 strains). We focused on the resistance patterns of 118 selected E. faecium and E. faecalis strains to 13 antimicrobial active agents (ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, avilamycin, chloramphenicol, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, flavomycin, gentamicin, penicillin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, teicoplanin, tetracycline and vancomycin). From the clinical point of view, the situation of antibiotic resistance to the examined antimicrobial agents seemed to be favourable. The investigated strains were sensitive to ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. These antibiotics are, in combination with an aminoglycoside, for example gentamicin, agents of choice for the treatment of enterococcal infections in human medicine. Only one E. faecium strain was resistant to penicillin, while all strains were sensitive to the glycopeptide antibiotics, vancomycin and teicoplanin. Resistances found against the antibiotics, tetracycline, quinupristin/dalfopristin and erythromycin, are causes for concern.
TI  - Species identification and detection of vancomycin resistance genes in enterococci of animal origin by multiplex PCR.
AB  - A multiplex PCR assay for the differentiation of species and detection of vancomycin (van) resistance genes in enterococci was established. Three hundred sixty-seven enterococcal strains isolated from food were selected from a sample collection and were examined with regards to the existence of four vancomycin resistance genes (vanA, vanB, vanC1 and vanC2) and to species differentiation (E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. casseliflavus and E. gallinarum) by multiplex PCR. Apart from unambiguous results for the majority of strains, the E. faecium specific primers used here, showed weak points in the specificity and sensitivity, respectively. Despite these rare instances, we succeeded in optimising the multiplex PCR assay by variation of annealing temperature and primer combination. The assay presented here, with its optimised parameters, is therefore suitable for routine use and because of time and material saving, it is an alternative and rapid method in comparison to conventional tests.
TI  - Taxonomy, ecology and antibiotic resistance of enterococci from food and the gastro-intestinal tract.
AB  - Apart from genotypic identification methods, there is a need for reliable conventional phenotypic identification schemes for simple and rapid determination of enterococcal species in food or in the gastro-intestinal tract (GIT). Only a limited number of enterococcal species is of importance for the ecology of the GIT or the food microflora, including E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. durans/hirae, E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus. After genus identification the differentiation within these species can include, e.g. mannitol and arabinose fermentation and growth at 50 degrees C. Widely used commercial identification systems may fail to precisely identify rare species. Ecological aspects should also be taken into account. In the human GIT E. faecium is the most common species whereas in most animal species E. faecalis is at least present in the same amount. Especially in foods of animal origin (cheese, pork meat, beef, poultry meat) also E. faecalis is very frequent. This is of special interest as glycopeptide resistance is most often found in human clinical E. faecium strains as well as in E. faecium from the environment or animal samples and less frequent in E. faecalis strains. EU experts propose as safety criteria for probiotics in feed additives the exclusion of resistances or the lack of transferability. This proposal can also be applied to enterococci in foods. Specific resistances must be excluded, but transferability or acquisition of resistance (e.g. vancomycin) cannot be excluded per se. However, technologically used strains should differ from clinical strains concerning their resistance patterns and transfer rates.
TI  - Infrequent occurrence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in poultry from Malaysian wet markets.
AB  - Fifty samples of chicken, duck and geese faeces were obtained from 13 wet markets in Kuala Lumpur to study the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) among local market poultry. Biotyping of colonies grown on azide agar incubated at 45 degrees C yielded E. pseudoavium, E. faecalis, E. faecium and E. gallinarum from chicken faeces and E. malodoratus, E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. gallinarum, E. hirae/dispar, and E. durans from goose and duck faeces. On agar containing 6 mg/ l of vancomycin, one strain of E. flavescens was identified, giving a VRE detection rate of 2.0%. This isolate had a vancomycin M.I.C. of 8 mg/l as determined by the Etest, and the van C-3 gene that was identified by PCR followed by sequence analysis. The prevalence of VRE among poultry sold in local markets appears to be low, and may reflect the infrequent use of antimicrobials in our poultry farms. Nevertheless, the possibility of human acquisition of microbes via the food chain cautions against the use of antimicrobials in animal husbandry that may encourage the emergence and spread of multi-drug resistant organisms like the VRE among animal microbial flora.
TI  - Susceptibility of Gram-positive bacteria from ICU patients in UK hospitals to antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Microbiologists in 25 sentinel laboratories were each asked to refer up to 100 clinically-significant Gram-positive bacteria isolated from consecutive intensive care unit (ICU) patients. A total of 1595 isolates were collected from patients in 23 hospitals; these included Staphylococcus aureus (47.6%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (30.6%), enterococci (14.3%), pneumococci (2.8%) and other streptococci (3.5%). A few coryneforms, other bacilli and a Nocardia sp. were also collected. Rates of oxacillin resistance among S. aureus and CNS isolates were 59.3 and 78.5%, respectively. Vancomycin-resistant S. aureus were not detected, although two isolates (0.3%) were resistant to teicoplanin [minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) 8 mg/L]. In contrast, 13.7% of CNS were teicoplanin resistant (MICs 8-32 mg/L) and 1.2% were resistant to vancomycin. Among the enterococci, 72.5% were Enterococcus faecalis and 24.5% were Enterococcus faecium, the remainder including isolates of Enterococcus casseliflavus or Enterococcus gallinarum. Eighteen percent of E. faecium isolates were vancomycin-resistant, compared with only 3% of E. faecalis isolates. Rates of high-level gentamicin resistance in E. faecalis and E. faecium were 40 and 25%, respectively. Nine percent of pneumococci and streptococci were resistant to penicillin, with 7 and 11%, respectively, resistant to erythromycin. None of the isolates showed resistance to linezolid, with the MICs for the entire study population falling in the range of 0.5-4 mg/L.
TI  - [Characterization of persistence factors of enterococci].
AB  - Persistence factors is some species of enterococci (E. faecium, E. faecalis, E. gallinarum), isolated from healthy children and from children with purulent inflammatory diseases, were studied. The study revealed some interspecific and intraspecific differences in the activity of these factors, linked with the presence of purulent inflammatory process induced by enterococci.
TI  - [Drug sensitivity of Enterococcus sp. strains isolated from clinical material or  from healthy persons].
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the drug susceptibility of Enterococcus sp. strains isolated in 2000-2001, from patients of five Warsaw's hospitals (154 strains) and from fecal samples of healthy persons (33 strains). On biochemical reaction profiles species of clinical enterococci were identified as: E. faecalis--66.2%, E. faecium--29.2%, E. hirae--1.9%, E. gallinarum--1.3%, E. casseliflavus--0.6% and E. avium--0.6%. The species of enterococci from stool's samples were identified as: E. faecalis--28 strains, E. durans--2 strains and single strains: E. faecium, E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus. Susceptibility to 20 antibiotics was tested by disc diffusion method. None of these 187 enterococcal strains was vancomycin resistant; 3 strains of E. gallinarum and 1--E. casseliflavus demonstrated intermediately susceptibility to vancomycin, but they were susceptible to teicoplanin--phenotype Van C. Among clinical strains were resistant to penicillin--33.3% of E. faecalis and 100% of E. faecium, to ampicillin--over 80% of E. faecium and 1 strain of E. faecalis. None of these strains produced beta-lactamase. High-level resistance to aminoglicoside was expressed by 48 strains (47.1%) E. faecalis and 36 (80%) E. faecium isolated from clinical specimens. Both--HLR to streptomycin and gentamycin were found in 28.3% of E. faecalis and 68.9% of E. faecium. Among 33 strains isolated from fecal samples of healthy persons--3 of E. faecalis were resistant to streptomycin and one was resistant to both gentamicin and streptomycin. In general, enterococcal strains isolated from samples of healthy persons were susceptible to the most of used antibiotics. But to rifampicin none of these strains were susceptible. There were about 40% of E. faecalis strains isolated from healthy persons, resistant to tetracyline.
TI  - Real-time PCR for the rapid detection of vanA and vanB genes.
AB  - A real-time PCR assay suitable for use on the Roche LightCycler platform was developed to replace an existing gel-based PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of the vanA & vanB genes in enterococcal isolates. Novel Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) hybridization probes were designed. The multiplex real-time PCR assay and the existing gel-based assay were 100% concordant and both correctly detected the vanA or vanB genes in 4/4 VanA E. faecium and 25/25 VanB E. faecium. Additionally, 1/1 VanC1 E. gallinarum, 1/1 VanC2 E. casseliflavus and 47/47 vancomycin susceptible enterococci were negative for the vanA and vanB genes in both PCR assays. Results were available within 1.5 h for the real-time PCR assay compared to up to 5.5 h for the conventional PCR assay.
TI  - Phenotypes and genotypes of vancomycin-resistant enterococci isolated during long-term follow-up in a patient with recurrent bacteremia and colonization.
AB  - Twenty-seven isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were obtained at monthly intervals from a bed-ridden man with hypoxic encephalopathy. During the 28-month period of the patient's hospitalization, 3 episodes of bacteremia and one episode of catheter-related infection caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci occurred. Rectal swabs showed colonization of vancomycin-resistant enterococci for more than 2 years. Three months after termination of antimicrobial therapy, the rectal colonization for vancomycin-resistant enterococci was eradicated. Four species (Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus gallinarum, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus casseliflavus) were identified among the 27 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus isolates. Three non-clonal related patterns were found among 17 strains of E. faecium by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. All of the 3 E. faecalis isolates were of the VanB phenotype, but of the vanA genotype. Linezolid had the most potent in vitro activity against these vancomycin-resistant enterococcus isolates, with minimum inhibitory concentrations >2 microg/mL. Eighty-five percent of these vancomycin-resistant enterococcus isolates were susceptible to tetracycline and 66% were susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. Although a high genetic correlation of E. faecium was identified in the patient with prolonged hospitalization, the isolation of 3 genetically unrelated colonized isolates suggested a lack of correlation between infection and colonization. Precautions against resistant organisms, adapted antibiotic policies, and elimination of patient carriage are useful for controlling the spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
TI  - Prevalence of streptogramin resistance genes among Enterococcus isolates recovered from retail meats in the Greater Washington DC area.
AB  - The prevalence of streptogramin resistance genes in enterococci recovered from retail poultry in the Greater Washington DC area was examined. Forty-three chicken and 32 turkey retail samples were analysed. Thirty-one non-Enterococcus faecalis enterococcal strains were isolated that displayed MICs of quinupristin-dalfopristin and virginiamycin of > or = 4 mg/L. These included Enterococcus faecium (turkey n = 4, chicken n = 23), Enterococcus gallinarum (turkey n = 2, chicken n = 1) and Enterococcus hirae (chicken n = 1). The presence of streptogramin resistance genes was examined by PCR in all non-E. faecalis isolates. The vat(E) gene was detected in 10/23 chicken E. faecium and from 2/4 turkey E. faecium. No other streptogramin resistance genes were detected by PCR. In addition, erm(B) was detected in all the E. faecium and E. gallinarum found in turkeys and in 7/23 E. faecium found in chickens. The vat(E) gene was transferable by conjugation from only two of the 12 E. faecium isolates (one from chicken and one from turkey). This study suggests that there is a high prevalence of low-level streptogramin resistance among enterococci found in retail poultry and that other, yet to be identified, mechanisms operate in these isolates that confer streptogramin resistance in enterococci.
TI  - Characterization of Tn1546 in vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium isolated  from canine urinary tract infections: evidence of gene exchange between human and animal enterococci.
AB  - Thirty-five enterococcal isolates were recovered from dogs diagnosed with urinary tract infections at the Michigan State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital over a 2-year period (1996 to 1998). Isolated species included Enterococcus faecium (n = 13), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 7), Enterococcus gallinarum (n = 11), and Enterococcus casseliflavus (n = 4). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed several different resistance phenotypes, with the majority of the enterococcal isolates exhibiting resistance to three or more antibiotics. One E. faecium isolate, CVM1869, displayed high-level resistance to vancomycin (MIC > 32 micro g/ml) and gentamicin (MIC > 2,048 micro g/ml). Molecular analysis of this isolate revealed the presence of Tn1546 (vanA), responsible for high-level vancomycin resistance, and Tn5281 carrying aac6'-aph2", conferring high-level aminoglycoside resistance. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that CVM1869 was a canine E. faecium clone that had acquired Tn1546, perhaps from a human vancomycin-resistant E. faecium. Transposons Tn5281 and Tn1546 were located on two different conjugative plasmids. Sequence analysis revealed that in Tn1546, ORF1 had an 889-bp deletion and an IS1216V insertion at the 5' end and an IS1251 insertion between vanS and vanH. To date, this particular form of Tn1546 has only been described in human clinical vancomycin-resistant enterococcus isolates unique to the United States. Additionally, this is the first report of a vancomycin-resistant E. faecium isolated from a companion animal in the United States.
TI  - Distribution of enterococci in Hong Kong.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the distribution of hospital isolates of enterococci from urines, bile, blood and body fluids and to evaluate different methods for the identification of enterococci. METHODS: Enterococci isolated from urine, bile, blood and body fluids collected during 1997 and 1998 were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), API 20 Strep and conventional biochemical tests. RESULTS: A total of 498 non-duplicate enterococci were studied: 398 and 43 isolates from urine and bile, respectively, 49 from blood, two from cerebrospinal fluid and six from body fluids. Both API 20 Strep and PCR gave the same identification results for 240 Enterococcus faecalis isolates, 45 E. faecium isolates and one isolate each of E. gallinarum and E. Casseliflavus. These isolates were re-defined by conventional biochemical tests. PCR could correctly identify 303 (98%) isolates while API 20 Strep could only correctly identify 287 (93%) isolates (99% of E. faecalis and 57-87% of the other Enterococcus sp.). Thus, PCR was used in the identification of the remaining isolates and the identity of isolates other than E. faecalis was subsequently confirmed by biochemical tests. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of enterococci isolated was E. faecalis (81%) while only 15% were E. faecium and 4% the other enterococcal species. PCR could correctly identify E. faecalis while the identity of other enterococcal species had to be confirmed by biochemical tests.
TI  - [Detection of Enterococcus with high-level aminoglycoside and glycopeptide resistance in Lactuca sativa (lettuce)].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the presence of enterococci highly resistant to aminoglycosides and glycopeptides in foods eaten uncooked, in order to evaluate their role as reservoirs of antimicrobial resistance. METHODS: We isolated 92 strains of enterococci from 79 samples of lettuce grown on farms near the city of Corrientes (Argentina). Enterococci were identified by standard methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by growth in azide dextrose broth supplemented with 500 microg/ml of gentamicin and 2,000 microg/ml of streptomycin, and by disk diffusion technique using disks with high levels of aminoglycosides, vancomycin and teicoplanin, in Muller Hinton agar. RESULTS: The most frequently detected species was E. faecium (32.61%), followed by E. faecalis (21.74%), E. gallinarum (13.04%), E. casseliflavus and E. mundtii (7.60%), E. hirae, (6.52%), E. durans (4.35%), E. raffinossus and E. saccharolyticus (2.17%), E. avium and E. malodoratus (1.10%). High-level resistance to streptomycin and gentamicin was found in 2 strains of E. Faecium. Resistance to streptomycin alone was observed in 2 strains of E. faecium, in 3 of E. hirae and in 1 of E. mundtii. Resistance only to gentamicin was not observed in any strain. None of the isolates showed glycopeptide resistance, except the intrinsically resistant species (E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus). CONCLUSION: These results confirm the presence of enterococci within the community having susceptibility profiles similar to those of strains found in hospitals.
TI  - Potential of Enterococcus faecalis as a human fecal indicator for microbial source tracking.
AB  - Regulatory agencies are interested in a fecal indicator bacterium with a host range limited to humans because human fecal contamination represents the greatest hazard to humans, yet is a relatively easy nonpoint source to remedy. Watersheds with human fecal contamination could be given first priority for cleanup. A fecal indicator bacterium with a host range limited to humans and a few other warm-blooded animal species would also simplify microbial source tracking because only a few animal species would be required for any host origin database. The literature suggests that the fecal indicator bacterium Enterococcus faecalis has a limited host range. On this basis, we selected this bacterium for study. Of 583 fecal streptococcal isolates obtained on Enterococcosel agar from Canada goose, cattle, deer, dog, human, chicken, and swine, 392 were considered presumptive enterococci and were subsequently speciated with the API 20 Strep system. Of these isolates, 22 were Ent. durans (5.6%), 61 were Ent. faecalis (15.6%), 98 were Ent. faecium (25.0%), 86 were Ent. gallinarum (21.9%), and 125 were unidentified (31.9%). The host range of the Ent. faecalis isolates was limited to dogs, humans, and chickens. Media were developed to isolate and identify Ent. faecalis quickly from fecal samples and this scheme eliminated Ent. faecalis isolates from dogs. When the remaining Ent. faecalis isolates were ribotyped, it was possible to differentiate clearly among the isolates from human and chicken. It may be that combining the potentially limited host range of Ent. faecalis with ribotyping is useful for prioritizing watersheds with fecal contamination.
TI  - In vitro activity of a new cephalosporin, RWJ-54428, against streptococci, enterococci and staphylococci, including glycopeptide-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The need for new antimicrobial agents with activity against Gram-positive organisms has become increasingly important because of emerging resistance. We compared the activity of a new b-lactam antimicrobial agent, RWJ-54428 (MC-02 479), with representatives of other classes of antimicrobial agents against 76 Staphylococcus aureus (including four glycopeptide- intermediate strains), 50 coagulase-negative staphylococci, 20 Enterococcus faecalis, 20 Enterococcus faecium, 10 Enterococcus gallinarum/Enterococcus casseliflavus, 54 Streptococcus pneumoniae and 22 viridans streptococcal isolates. The MIC(90) of RWJ-54,428 was < or = 2 mg/L for all groups of bacteria tested except E. faecium. The activity against four strains of glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus was similar to that for other methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates (range 0.5-2.0 mg/L).
TI  - Proficiency of Italian clinical laboratories in detecting reduced glycopeptide susceptibility in Enterococcus and Staphylococcus spp. using routine laboratory methodologies.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the ability of 59 clinical microbiology laboratories distributed throughout Italy to correctly identify and detect reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides in staphylococci and VanA-, VanB- or VanC-mediated glycopeptide resistance in enterococci. METHODS: Eight test strains comprising three staphylococci (S. aureus ATCC 29212 and two vancomycin-intermediate S. haemolyticus [11105301, 10030683Y]) and five enterococci (E. faecalis ATCC 29212, E. faecalis ATCC 51299 VanB, E. faecium AIB40 VanA, E. faecalis V583 VanB and E. gallinarum AIB39 VanC1) were distributed to 59 Italian clinical microbiology laboratories. Each isolate was blind-coded, and laboratories were instructed to identify the strains and test isolates for susceptibility to teicoplanin and vancomycin using their standard methods. Results were assessed against consensus test results obtained by a reference laboratory. In addition, to complement data interpretation, laboratories were asked to provide retrospective routine test results from their respective hospitals. RESULTS: All 59 laboratories participating in the study completed the susceptibility testing and provided data for analysis. A total of 53 laboratories provided retrospective routine data. Overall, laboratories were able to identify isolates to the genus level successfully. E. gallinarum and S. haemolyticus posed problems for species identification, with only 40.6 and 71.2%, respectively, of results reported correctly; most incorrect results were reported as 'other species'. For enterococcal test strains, VanA phenotypes were detected correctly by 96.6% of laboratories; VanB by 30.5% (E. faecalis ATCC 51299) and 88.1% (E. faecalis V583); and VanC1 by 67.8%. For staphylococcal test strains, 28.8% (S. haemolyticus 11105301) and 23.7% (S. haemolyticus 10030683Y) of the laboratories were able to detect reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. Errors in detecting vancomycin resistance in VanB and VanC1 enterococci were made with all methods, most noticeably by disk diffusion users. For staphylococci, most errors in reporting vancomycin-intermediate resistance occurred with disk diffusion and Vitek (software version 5.04) users. Overall, considerably fewer errors occurred with the detection of teicoplanin resistance, especially for staphylococci. For 1999, routine results show that 41/1749 (2.4%) of E. faecium, 220/11 180 (2.0%) of E. faecalis, 29/24 927 (0.12%) of S. aureus and 54/22 102 (0.24%) of coagulase-negative staphylococci were reported as resistant to vancomycin. CONCLUSION: Italian laboratories are able to identify staphylococci and enterococci adequately, although all methodologies used have problems in identifying E. gallinarum and coagulase-negative staphylococci to the species level. While VanA phenotypes were efficiently detected, problems were experienced in detecting VanB and VanC phenotypes. The majority of laboratories were unable to detect reduced vancomycin susceptibility in staphylococci adequately, especially with disk diffusion and older Vitek systems. Teicoplanin appeared useful as a marker for detecting vancomycin resistance, particularly with disk diffusion. Should enterococcal VanB or staphylococcal glycopeptide-intermediate phenotypes become prevalent in Italy, it is likely that they would be under-detected. New systems under development, such as Vitek2, should improve this situation.
TI  - Stool colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci in healthcare workers and their households.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of stool colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) among healthcare workers (HCWs) and their families. DESIGN: Prospective assessment of fecal colonization with VRE. SETTING: A 603-bed, tertiary-care teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Healthy volunteers recruited from hospital employees and their households were screened to exclude pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, immunosuppressive disorders, and recent use of antimicrobials. INTERVENTION: Self-obtained stool swabs were used to obtain cultures. Isolated enterococci were screened for vancomycin resistance and species were identified. Intra-household isolates were genotyped using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS: The participants (n = 228; age range, 28 days to 80 years) were from 137 households with and 91 without employees who had contact with patients. Enterococcus species were isolated from 127 stool specimens (55.7%). VRE were detected in 12 individuals, representing 6 E. casseliflavus, 5 E. faecium, and 1 E. gallinarum. VRE were more commonly isolated in employees who had contact with patients (5 of 52 vs 0 of 40; relative risk [RR], 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI95], 1.5 to 2.2; P = .07) and their household members (10 of 137 vs 2 of 91; RR, 3.3; CI95, 0.7 to 14.8; P = .13). In 2 households (2 adults in a physician's household and an adult plus a child in a nurse's household) PFGE analysis demonstrated identical intra-household strains of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium. CONCLUSIONS: VRE colonization was found in 5.3% of screened stools and was more prevalent in HCWs who had contact with patients and their households. Identical PFGE patterns between 2 employees who had contact with patients and their household members demonstrated probable intra-household spread. Although the mode of acquisition was uncertain, the association with employees who had contact with patients suggests possible occupational sources. These findings demonstrate the spread of VRE within the household and implicate occupational risk for its acquisition.
TI  - Identification of enterococci and determination of their glycopeptide resistance  in German and Austrian clinical microbiology laboratories.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine exactly how German and Austrian routine laboratories perform tests for the identification of enterococci and determination of their glycopoptide resistance. METHODS: Six enterococcal test strains with different types of glycopeptide resistance (Enterococcus faecium, VanA; E. faecalis, VanA; E. faecium, VanB; E. faecalis, VanB; E. gallinarum, VanC1; E. casseliflavus, VanC2) were sent as anonymous isolates to 73 clinical microbiology laboratories (65 in Germany; eight in Austria). The participating laboratories had to identify the strains up to the species level and to determine their antibiotic susceptibilities to the glycopeptides vancomycin and teicoplanin by the test method(s) that are used daily in the corresponding laboratories. RESULTS: The analysis of the results received from 62 laboratories (56 from Germany, six from Austria) demonstrated that the most used routine method in susceptibility testing was the agar diffusion test, followed by the Etest, and the microbroth dilution procedure. The majority of participants had no difficulties in susceptibility testing with the VanA-type strains. However, the agar diffusion test was often not able to recognize clearly the VanB and VanC strains; some problems also arose with VanB isolates in the Etest. With the microbroth dilution method, the corresponding type of glycopeptide resistance was correctly determined in the majority of enterococcal test strains. Difficulties also arose in identification, especially with the VanC strains (E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus), which were often falsely identified as E. faecium. The reasons for these errors are obviously based on the lack of important tests (such as motility and presence of a yellow pigment) in some commercially available identification test kits.
TI  - Composition of enterococcal and streptococcal flora from pigeon intestines.
AB  - AIMS: To identify the streptococcal and enterococcal components of the microflora from pigeon intestines to species level by tDNA-intergenic polymerase chain reaction. METHODS AND RESULTS: Gram-positive coccal strains were isolated from the intestines or faeces of 50 different pigeons, all from different lofts, on Columbia CNA blood agar. Sodium azide-sensitive enterococci were found to constitute the major coccal members of the intestinal flora of pigeons. Forty-two of 69 isolates were identified as Enterococcus columbae (84% of animals tested positive), while E. cecorum was encountered in 28% of all animals (14 isolates). Minor species (less than 10% of pigeons positive) were E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. gallinarum, E. casseliflavus, Streptococcus alactolyticus and Strep. gallolyticus. Contrary to the species description of E. columbae and E. cecorum, some of the strains were found to be motile. Certain other minor differences with the species description of E. columbae are also indicated. CONCLUSIONS: Enterococcus columbae is the major Gram-positive facultatively anaerobic component of the pigeon intestinal flora. Certain phenotypic characteristics differ from the original species description. The potentially pathogenic Strep. gallolyticus is a minor component of the microflora. Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis are rare in pigeons. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The enterococcal and streptococcal flora of pigeons is composed of mainly host-specific bacteria. These are not likely to act as zoonotic pathogens nor as carriers of antibiotic resistance determinants possibly spreading to humans.
TI  - Comparison of two commercially available selective media to screen for vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  - Campylobacter medium (CAMPY, Becton Dickinson [BD] Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, MD) and Vancomycin Screen Agar (VSA, BD) were compared for their ability to screen for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) from primary plates. A microdilution minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay (Pasco, BD) served as the reference vancomycin MIC. In the random sample of 200 enterococcal clinical isolates tested, the distribution of isolates was as follows: Enterococcus faecium, 113 (97 VRE); Enterococcus faecalis, 71(12 VRE); Enterococcus gallinarum, 10; and Enterococcus casseliflavus, 6. Of the 75 vancomycin-susceptible strains, none grew on CAMPY and 4 grew on VSA, whereas all 109 VRE isolates grew on both screen plates. Of the 16 strains with a Van C phenotype, ie, E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus, 2 grew on CAMPY and 14 on VSA. Of the 899 clinical specimens plated onto both agars, 45 of 67 VRE were detected with both media, 20 were detected only with CAMPY and 2 were not detected by either screen plate. CAMPY compared with VSA as a primary plating medium was more sensitive and, when used to screen for VRE isolates from primary plates, was more specific for strains displaying Van A and B phenotypes.
TI  - Implications of multiple antimicrobial-resistant enterococci associated with the  poultry environment.
AB  - Poultry are increasingly being associated with carriage of multiresistant organisms that may cause disease in humans. Among these organisms are the enterococci, not regarded as a common cause of hospital-acquired infections. The use of antimicrobials for growth promotion in poultry production envronments may facilitate the dissemination of resistance to Enterococcus spp. that have the potential to be clinically significant. To assess descriptively the degree of multiresistant enterococci in the poultry environment of the Delmarva (Delaware-Maryland-Virginia) East Coast region of the USA, litter samples from regional commercial poultry houses and transport container swabs from processing facilities were cultured for Enterococcus spp. Using a microtiter plate adaptation of a conventional biochemical screen, the predominant species identfied were E. faecalis (61.2%), E. faecium (18.6%) and E. gallinarum (2.4%). Resistance to the cephalosporin, macrolide and tetracycline classes of antimicrobials was uniform with broader resistance to penicillin and derivatives present in a majority of E. faecium isolates. High-level streptomycin resistance was evident in close to 30% of all isolates with a majority of E. faecalis variants possessing resistance. High-level gentamicin resistance was detected at a low frequency (2.6%) only within the E. faecalis group with resistance to low-level gentamicin levels present in a majority of both the E. faecalis group and subsets of E. faecium. No unexpected vancomycin resistance was detected. Of particular interest was resistance to the streptogramin quinupristin-dalfopristin (Q-D or Synercid), which was present in 70.4% of E. faecium and E. faecium variants.
TI  - The DUEL study: a multi-center in vitro evaluation of linezolid compared with other antibiotics in the Netherlands.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate bacterial susceptibility to linezolid in the Netherlands in comparison with other antibiotics. METHODS: Bacterial strains were isolated between September 1999 and January 2000 from patients presumed to require antibiotic treatment. The in vitro activity of 1226 strains from 34 participating laboratories was tested against linezolid, vancomycin, teicoplanin, oxacillin, penicillin, erythromycin, ampicillin and other antibiotics against enterococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were obtained with the E test on Mueller-Hinton agar: every laboratory included control strains. For vancomycin and teicoplanin only, brain-heart infusion agar and an inoculum of 2.0 McFarland was used for Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci to support a better growth and clear recognition of hetero-resistant colonies. RESULTS: The values of MIC90 for linezolid were 1.5, 0.75, 0.75 and 1 mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci, respectively. Six enterococcal strains with decreased susceptibility against vancomycin or teicoplanin were identified as Enterococcus faecium, E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus (two strains each) and they were found to harbor vanA, vanC1 and vanC2/3 genes, respectively. Nine per cent of Streptococcus pneumoniae (an increase from 1% 4 years ago) showed decreased susceptibility to erythromycin, of both the ermB and mefE type; there was no cross-resistance with linezolid. Twelve coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains were resistant to teicoplanin. CONCLUSION: Linezolid is a promising drug in the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive cocci. Cross-resistance with other antibiotics tested was not found.
TI  - [Epidemiological study on vancomycin-resistant enterococci from fecal samples in  the east area of Japan].
AB  - Recently, Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have become important nosocomial pathogens in the world. In Japan, the VRE-infection was first reported in 1996. However, an epidemiological study on VRE has not been aggressively done in Japan. We conducted a survey study to explore the incidence and antimicrobial susceptibility of vancomycin-resistant enterococci isolated from fecal samples at 45 hospitals in the east area of Japan (Kanto, Koshinetsu, Tohoku, and Hokkaido) during June 1998 to March 1999. The Enterococcosel agar containing vanocomycin (BBL) was used for screening VRE from fecal samples in each hospital. The susceptibilities of the isolates to 8 antimicrobials were determined by the broth microdilution method and the definitions of resistance were based on current standards of the NCCLS standards. The VRE genotypes (vanA, vanB, vanC1, and van C2/3) were confirmed by amplifying the respective genes by PCR. Eight hundred and ninety four strains of enterococci were tested by the microtiter plates hybridization method (WAKUNAGA SEIYAKU, Japan). One thousand five hundred eighty three strains of enterococci were collected from 6,914 patients in 45 hospitals. These strains included 72 (4.5%) strains Enterococcus faecalis, 33 (2.1%) strains Enterococcus faecium, 17 (1.1%) strains Enterococcus avium, 1,040 (65.7%) strains Enterococcus gallinarum, 386 (24.4%) strains Enterococcus cassliflavus, and 35 (2.2%) strains Enterococcus flavescens. These strains of vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis were isolated from 3 patients, two of these 3 strains had van A gene and other one had van B gene. Those 3 strains were in the Kanto area, and 2 of 3 strains were in Tokyo, Generally, though van A type VRE was highly resistaant to both vancomycin and teicoplanin. In our study, two strains of van A type E. faecalis were highly resistant to vancomycin (MICs > 128 micrograms/ml) and susceptible to teicoplanin with MICs 4 micrograms/ml. Those two strains were different in susceptibilities of minocycline and ofloxacin. The result of the analysis of PFGE had also different patterns. VanB type E. fecalis was highly resistant to vancomycin and susceptible to teicoplanin (MICs 0.25 microgram/ml). For ampicillin and imipenem, 3 strains of E. faecalis were susceptible (MIC < or = 1 microgram/ml). One of 562 strains of E. gallinarum had vanB and vanC1 genes and was moderately resistant to vancomycin and susceptible to teicoplanin. All strains of E. casseliflavus and E. flavescens had vanC2/C3 gene only. All strains of E. faecium and E. avium did not detect van genes. From this result, it was supposed that VRE were very rare in the east of Japan.
TI  - Phenotypic and genetic diversity of enterococci isolated from Italian cheeses.
AB  - In the present study, 124 enterococcal strains, isolated from traditional Italian cow, goat and buffalo cheeses, were characterized using phenotypic features and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR). The RAPD-PCR profiles obtained with four primers and five different amplification conditions were compared by numerical analysis and allowed an inter- and intraspecific differentiation of the isolates. Whole cell protein analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used as a reference method for species identification. The strains were identified as Enterococcus faecalis (82 strains), E. faecium (27 strains), E. durans (nine strains), E. gallinarum (four strains) and E. hirae (two strains). Species recognition by means of RAPD-PCR was in agreement with the SDS-PAGE results except for eight strains of E. faecium that clustered in separated groups. On the other hand, phenotypic identification based on carbohydrate fermentation profiles, using the rapid ID 32 STREP galleries, gave different results from SDS-PAGE in 12.1% of the cases. The majority of the strains had weak acidifying and proteolytic activities in milk. One E. faecium strain showed vanA (vancomycin resistance) genotype while four strains showed a beta-haemolytic reaction on human blood. Several strains showed antagonistic activity towards indicator strains of Listeria innocua, Clostridium tyrobutyricam and Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii.
TI  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 Gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of Gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates. MICs were determined by an agar dilution method on Mueller-Hinton agar (NCCLS/EUCAST) and on Isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/L free calcium (BSAC). Both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. Daptomycin MICs for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/L. For 99 of the 100 enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; Enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/L. For all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin MICs were 0.016- 0.25 mg/L; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/L. For miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus spp., Leuconostoc spp., Pediococcus spp. and isolates of Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin MICs were 0.03-2 mg/L; MICs for the seven isolates of Listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/L. There was little difference between the results on Mueller-Hinton agar and on supplemented Isotonic agar The discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented Isotonic agar. Daptomycin was active (MICs < or = 2 mg/L) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of E. faecium and L. monocytogenes (MICs = 4 mg/L). Our results indicate that daptomycin MICs are independent of methicillin and vancomycin MICs.
TI  - Recovery from a single blood culture of two enterococcus gallinarum isolates carrying both vanC-1 and vanA cluster genes and differing in glycopeptide susceptibility.
AB  - Two Enterococcus gallinarum isolates distinguished by different colony sizes were recovered from the same blood culture from a woman with acute myeloid leukemia. They were designated E31 (the one with larger colonies) and E32 (the one with smaller colonies). Both isolates were glycopeptide resistant, but the MICs of vancomycin and teicoplanin for E31 (32 and 2 microg/ml, respectively, consistent with the VanC phenotype) and E32 (128 and 16 microg/ml, respectively, consistent with the VanA phenotype) were different. E31 and E32 had the same plasmid profile and showed identical pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns after digestion of total DNA with NotI and a two-band variation after digestion with SmaI. Polymerase chain reaction experiments showed that both isolates had both the vanC-1 and vanA genes and carried a Tn1546-related transposon lacking orf1, vanY, and vanZ. The absence of these three genes was confirmed by Southern analysis with appropriate probes. Southern hybridization experiments using a vanA probe showed that this atypical Tn1546-related element appeared to be located on the chromosome. In both E31 and E32, the vanA probe hybridized to EcoRV and HindIII fragments larger in size than the hybridizing fragments observed in the VanA prototype strain Enterococcus faecium BM4147, suggesting the lack of the relevant EcoRV and HindIII restriction sites.
TI  - Identification of enterococcal isolates by temperature gradient gel electrophoresis and partial sequence analysis of PCR-amplified 16S rDNA variable V6 regions.
AB  - Based on partial sequence analysis of PCR-amplified 16S rDNA variable V6 regions  of 14 enterococcal type strains, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus mundtii, Enterococcus gallinarum, Enterococcus avium, Enterococcus raffinosus and Enterococcus saccharolyticus showed characteristic sequence motifs which made it possible to separate them into six individual species lines. Furthermore, two species cluster groups could be identified, including (i) Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus malodoratus, and (ii) Enterococcus casseliflavus/Enterococcus flavescens, Enterococcus pseudoavium, Enterococcus dispar and Enterococcus sulfureus. There were identical DNA sequences in the V6 region within each group. Temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) of the PCR products from 16 type strains, 12 enterococcal reference strains and 8 clinical isolates revealed that a single nucleotide divergence in DNA sequences was sufficient for separation, identification and division of the studied enterococcal strains into corresponding TTGE profiles. It was concluded that partial DNA sequence analysis and TTGE profiling of PCR-amplified 16S rDNA variable V6 regions provide useful tools for the identification of clinically important Enterococcus spp.
TI  - Resistance to linezolid: characterization of mutations in rRNA and comparison of  their occurrences in vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  - To assess the potential for emergence of resistance during the use of linezolid,  we tested 10 clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) (four Enterococcus faecalis, five Enterococcus faecium, and one Enterococcus gallinarum) as well as a vancomycin-susceptible control (ATCC 29212) strain of E. faecalis. The enterococci were exposed to doubling dilutions of linezolid for 12 passes. After the final passage, the linezolid plate growing VRE contained a higher drug concentration with E. faecalis than with E. faecium. DNA sequencing of the 23S rRNA genes revealed that linezolid resistance in three E. faecalis isolates was associated with a guanine to uracil transversion at bp 2576, while the one E. faecium isolate for which the MIC was 16 microg/ml contained a guanine to adenine transition at bp 2505.
TI  - Gastrointestinal colonisation of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus in a Singapore teaching hospital.
AB  - Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) has become an important nosocomial pathogen in many countries but is still rare in Singapore. A study was conducted from January to March 1997 at a 900-bed teaching hospital to determine the prevalence of intestinal colonisation of VRE in the patient population. A total of 299 consecutive stool specimens received by the microbiology laboratory for routine testing were plated onto two different selective media for comparison. VRE isolated were phenotypically characterised using minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to vancomycin and teicoplanin and then typed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) with Smal digestion of DNA. VRE were detected in the stool of 35 patients (12.3%). This group consisted of four isolates with VanB (one Enterococcus faecalis and three E. faecium) and 31 isolates with VanC (30 E. casseliflavus and one E. gallinarum). Two patients (0.7%) carried isolates (both VanB) with high level resistance to vancomycin (MIC > or = 256 microg/ml) while the rest had isolates of low level resistance (MIC = 8 microg/ml). Except for isolates from the same patients, PFGE patterns were diverse, suggesting that the VRE isolates were genotypically different and possibly introduced from many sources. This study demonstrates that VRE colonisation is not uncommon in the Singapore patient population.
TI  - Bile salt hydrolase activity of Enterococci isolated from food: screening and quantitative determination.
AB  - One hundred seventeen enterococcal strains isolated from food (47 Enterococcus faecium, 48 Enterococcus faecalis, 16 Enterococcus durans, 2 Enterococcus gallinarum, 3 Enterococcus casseliflavus, and 1 Enterococcus malodoratus) were screened for bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity on de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe agar medium containing taurocholic acid and calcium chloride. The highest incidence of BSH-active strains was observed for E. faecalis (81%) followed by E. faecium (50%) and E. durans (44%). Isolates were grouped into four putative activity groups (no, low, medium, and high activity) based on the size of precipitation zones observed in the screening experiment. Our results showed that assumptions on BSH activity based on the size of bile precipitation zones in screening experiments did not correlate with actual activity as quantified by high-pressure liquid chromatography, but the screening assay is useful for assessing the presence or absence of BSH activity.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of Enterococci in Lebanon.
AB  - There is little information on the types of Enterococcus spp and their antibiotic resistance patterns in Lebanon. One hundred and fifty-three consecutive clinical enterococcal isolates collected between 1998 and 1999 were tested against 11 antimicrobial agents using disk diffusion and the Etest. The isolates were identified by conventional methods and API-Strep and were found to consist of Enterococcus faecalis (72.5%), Enterococcus faecium (22.9%), Enterococcus avium (3.2%) and Enterococcus gallinarum (1.3%). The percent of resistant strains of E. faecalis and E. faecium respectively were, ampicillin 0.9 and 14%, erythromycin 59% and 40%, tetracycline 72% and 34%, chloramphenicol 32 and 11%, rifampin 36% and 57%, ciprofloxacin, 23% and 34%, norfloxacin 22 and 8%. High level aminoglycoside (HLA) resistance was found in 19% E. faecalis and 9% E. faecium for gentamicin and 36% and 26% for streptomycin. Excellent correlation was observed between the high level disk tests and the Etest in the detection of HLA resistance but not with the regular disks. None of the isolates showed resistance to vancomycin or teicoplanin except for one E. gallinarum isolate which showed intermediate resistance (MIC 16 mg/l) to vancomycin. These variable antimicrobial rates of resistance suggest a surveillance programme for antimicrobial resistance in this country would be helpful to help control infection, guide empirical antibiotic therapy and implement a policy of antibiotic usage.
TI  - Detection and characterization of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in farm animals and raw meat products in Italy.
AB  - The emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in Europe has been ascribed to the long-time use of the glycopeptide antibiotic avoparcin as feed additive in food animals, until its ban in 1997 in EU. The pres- ence of VRE in food of animal origin is believed to represent a potential risk for the consumer. We studied the fecal carriage of VRE in broiler chickens and slaughter pigs in Italy before the avoparcin ban and eval- uated the impact of avoparcin withdrawal on the presence of VRE in raw meat products. Broilers and pigs were both found to be frequently colonized by VRE, as 36% and 24.6% of the flocks or the herds, respec- tively, were positive. Molecular typing of VRE strains by PFGE showed that animals housed in different pens within the same farm were colonized by clonally related strains. After the avoparcin ban, a decrease in the rate of VRE contamination in meat products was observed. Such a decrease was statistically significant in poultry (from 18.8% to 9.6%) but not in pork products (from 9.7% to 6.9%). The majority of VRE from all sources carried the vanA resistance gene and included Enterococcus faecium, E. faecalis, E. hirae, E. durans, and E. gallinarum. None of the strains carried the vanB gene, whereas constitutively resistant vanC-positive strains were frequently found. Our results show that avoparcin withdrawal has been successful in reducing VRE contamination in meat products. However, this measure needs to be complemented by a prudent use of glycopeptide antibiotics in human medicine.
TI  - In-vitro activity of fosfomycin against vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  - The effect of fosfomycin against 69 vancomycin-resistant isolates of Enterococcus faecium (VanA), five of E. faecium (VanB), 11 of Enterococcus faecalis (VanA), three of E. faecalis (VanB), 10 of Enterococcus gallinarum (VanC1) and two of Enterococcus casseliflavus (VanC2) and glycopeptide-sensitive E. faecium (n = 8) and E. faecalis (n = 10) was tested in vitro. Fosfomycin inhibited 97%, 94% and 96% of the vancomycin-resistant strains, according to results of agar dilution, broth microdilution, and a disc diffusion method (DIN 58940). The disc diffusion test by the NCCLS method does not include fosfomycin; using breakpoints suggested by Andrews et al. (< or = 11 mm, resistant; > or = 18 mm, susceptible), 5% of the vancomycin-resistant strains tested would have been considered fosfomycin resistant. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of most vancomycin-resistant isolates were in the intermediate sensitivity range, yielding an MIC50 of 32 mg/L and an MIC90 of 64 mg/L. Moreover the majority of inhibitory zone sizes by the disc diffusion method (DIN 58940) corresponded to intermediate susceptibility. These results suggest that fosfomycin at a high dosage and possibly used in combination with other drugs could be a potentially useful drug for the treatment of infections caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
TI  - Prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in Europe.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in Europe. Overall, 49 laboratories in 27 countries collected 4,208 clinical isolates of enterococci. Species identification, susceptibility testing, and van gene determination by polymerase chain reaction were performed in a central laboratory. Overall, 18 vanA and 5 vanB isolates of VRE were found. The prevalence of vanA VRE was highest in the UK (2.7%), while the prevalence of vanB VRE was highest in Slovenia (2%). Most vanA and vanB VRE were identified as Enterococcus faecium. Most VRE isolates originated from the patient's urogenital tract, skin, or digestive tract. VRE were equally distributed among clinical departments, with no clear preponderance in any single patient group. A total of 71 isolates containing the vanC gene were identified. The prevalence of vanC VRE was highest in Latvia and Turkey, where rates were 14.3 and 11.7%, respectively. Two-thirds of these isolates were identified as Enterococcus gallinarum and one-third as Enterococcus casseliflavus; the majority of these isolates were cultured from feces. Almost all isolates were obtained from hospitalized patients, mostly children. The highest prevalence of high-level gentamicin-resistant enterococci was seen in Turkey and Greece. In general, the distribution of this resistance type seemed unrelated to the occurrence of VRE. The prevalence of vanA/ vanB VRE in Europe is still low; the majority of the VRE isolates exhibit the vanC genotype and colonize the gastrointestinal tract of hospitalized children.
TI  - Nitrofurantoin is active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  - The activity of nitrofurantoin was tested against 300 isolates of Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus gallinarum. No isolates tested were resistant to nitrofurantoin (MIC, >/=128 microg/ml), including vancomycin-resistant E. faecium isolates with vanA- and vanB-positive genotypes and vancomycin-resistant E. gallinarum isolates. We conclude that nitrofurantoin may provide effective treatment of urinary tract infections caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
TI  - Evidence for horizontal gene transfer in evolution of elongation factor Tu in enterococci.
AB  - The elongation factor Tu, encoded by tuf genes, is a GTP binding protein that plays a central role in protein synthesis. One to three tuf genes per genome are present, depending on the bacterial species. Most low-G+C-content gram-positive bacteria carry only one tuf gene. We have designed degenerate PCR primers derived from consensus sequences of the tuf gene to amplify partial tuf sequences from 17 enterococcal species and other phylogenetically related species. The amplified DNA fragments were sequenced either by direct sequencing or by sequencing cloned inserts containing putative amplicons. Two different tuf genes (tufA and tufB) were found in 11 enterococcal species, including Enterococcus avium, Enterococcus casseliflavus, Enterococcus dispar, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus gallinarum, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus malodoratus, Enterococcus mundtii, Enterococcus pseudoavium, and Enterococcus raffinosus. For the other six enterococcal species (Enterococcus cecorum, Enterococcus columbae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus sulfureus, Enterococcus saccharolyticus, and Enterococcus solitarius), only the tufA gene was present. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the 11 species having two tuf genes all have a common ancestor, while the six species having only one copy diverged from the enterococcal lineage before that common ancestor. The presence of one or two copies of the tuf gene in enterococci was confirmed by Southern hybridization. Phylogenetic analysis of tuf sequences demonstrated that the enterococcal tufA gene branches with the Bacillus, Listeria, and Staphylococcus genera, while the enterococcal tufB gene clusters with the genera Streptococcus and Lactococcus. Primary structure analysis showed that four amino acid residues encoded within the sequenced regions are conserved and unique to the enterococcal tufB genes and the tuf genes of streptococci and Lactococcus lactis. The data suggest that an ancestral streptococcus or a streptococcus-related species may have horizontally transferred a tuf gene to the common ancestor of the 11 enterococcal species which now carry two tuf genes.
TI  - Diversity of domain V of 23S rRNA gene sequence in different Enterococcus species.
AB  - The highly conserved central loop of domain V of 23S RNA (nucleotides 2042 to 2628; Escherichia coli numbering) is implicated in peptidyltransferase activity and represents one of the target sites for macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B antibiotics. DNA encoding domain V (590 bp) of several species of Enterococcus was amplified by PCR. Twenty enterococcal isolates were tested, including Enterococcus faecium (six isolates), Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus avium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus gallinarum, Enterococcus casseliflavus (two isolates of each), and Enterococcus raffinosus, Enterococcus mundtii, Enterococcus malodoratus, and Enterococcus hirae (one isolate of each). For all isolates, species identification by biochemical testing was corroborated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The sequence of domain V of the 23S rRNA gene from E. faecium and E. faecalis differed from those of all other enterococci. The domain V sequences of E. durans and E. hirae were identical. This was also true for E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus. E. avium differed from E. casseliflavus by 23 bases, from E. durans by 16 bases, and from E. malodoratus by 2 bases. E. avium differed from E. raffinosus by one base. Despite the fact that domain V is considered to be highly conserved, substantial differences were identified between several enterococcal species.
TI  - Identification of Enterococcus species and phenotypically similar Lactococcus and Vagococcus species by reverse checkerboard hybridization to chaperonin 60 gene sequences.
AB  - Data from four recent studies (S. H. Goh et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 36:2164-2166, 1998; S. H. Goh et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 34:818-823, 1996; S. H. Goh et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 35:3116-3121, 1997; A. Y. C. Kwok et al., Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 49:1181-1192, 1999) suggest that an approximately 600-bp region of the chaperonin 60 (Cpn60) gene, amplified by PCR with a single pair of degenerate primers, has utility as a potentially universal target for bacterial identification (ID). This Cpn60 gene ID method correctly identified isolates representative of numerous staphylococcal species and Streptococcus iniae, a human and animal pathogen. We report herein that this method enabled us to distinguish clearly between 17 Enterococcus species (Enterococcus asini, Enterococcus rattus, Enterococcus dispar, Enterococcus gallinarum, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus cecorum, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus mundtii, Enterococcus casseliflavus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus malodoratus, Enterococcus raffinosus, Enterococcus avium, Enterococcus pseudoavium, Enterococcus new sp. strain Facklam, and Enterococcus saccharolyticus), and Vagococcus fluvialis, Lactococcus lactis, and Lactococcus garvieae. From 123 blind-tested samples, only two discrepancies were observed between the Facklam and Collins phenotyping method (R. R. Facklam and M. D. Collins, J. Clin. Microbiol. 27:731-734, 1989) and the Cpn60 ID method. In each case, the discrepancies were resolved in favor of the Cpn60 ID method. The species distributions of the 123 blind-tested isolates were Enterococcus new sp. strain Facklam (ATCC 700913), 3; E. asini, 1; E. rattus, 4; E. dispar, 2; E. gallinarum, 20; E. hirae, 9; E. durans, 9; E. faecalis, 12; E. mundtii, 3; E. casseliflavus, 8; E. faecium, 25; E. malodoratus, 3; E. raffinosus, 8; E. avium, 4; E. pseudoavium, 1; an unknown Enterococcus clinical isolate, sp. strain R871; Vagococcus fluvialis, 4; Lactococcus garvieae, 3; Lactococcus lactis, 3; Leuconostoc sp., 1; and Pediococcus sp., 1. The Cpn60 gene ID method, coupled with reverse checkerboard hybridization, is an effective method for the identification of Enterococcus and related organisms.
TI  - Random amplification of polymorphic DNA versus pulsed field gel electrophoresis of SmaI DNA macrorestriction fragments for typing strains of vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  - Genetic typing of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) can be performed using a variety of methods, but comparative analyses of the quality of these methods are still relatively scarce. We here compare random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis with pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of DNA macrorestriction fragments as examples of two of the recent and well-accepted molecular typing methods. For the latter method, empirical guidelines for the interpretation of the DNA fingerprints have been proposed in the international literature. Based on our experimental analyses, we define similar criteria for RAPD fingerprinting. A collection of 100 strains of VRE, comprising Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus avium, Enterococcus gallinarum and Enterococcus casseliflavus, was assembled. Fifty isolates were Dutch, another 50 were isolated in the UK. Strains were selected on the basis of previously determined putative identity, close relatedness or uniqueness. The strains were analysed using well-standardised RAPD and PFGE protocols. Resulting fingerprints were interpreted with computerised methods involving band positioning and we show that typing of VRE by PFGE and RAPD generates highly congruent DNA fingerprint clustering. When the proposed international criteria for interpretation of PFGE fingerprints were applied in our case, 86% PFGE homology as discriminating value between close relatedness and uniqueness, a 75% homology cut-off for the comparison of the RAPD-generated DNA fingerprints revealed essentially identical strain clusters. As a spin-off it is revealed that strains from the different species can be efficiently discriminated, that strains from the UK and The Netherlands form separate clusters and that strains from veterinary origin can be identified separately as well.
TI  - Evaluation of D-xylose and 1% methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside fermentation tests for distinguishing Enterococcus gallinarum from Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - To determine the validity of the rapid xylose and methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside  (MDG) fermentation tests in distinguishing Enterococcus gallinarum from Enterococcus faecium, 156 well-characterized clinical isolates of enterococci (55 E. gallinarum, 91 E. faecium, and 10 Enterococcus faecalis isolates) known to be of different clones were examined in a blinded fashion. Species identification was confirmed by PCR of the ddl ligase genes of E. faecium and E. faecalis and the vanC1 gene of E. gallinarum. Xylose tests were performed with D-xylose tablets by using a heavy bacterial suspension and were interpreted after 2 h of incubation. Standard MDG fermentation tests were read after 24 h of incubation. The xylose fermentation test had a sensitivity of 98% (54 of 55) and a specificity of 99% (100 of 101) in distinguishing E. gallinarum from E. faecium and E. faecalis. The standard MDG test had a sensitivity of 100% (55 of 55) and a specificity of 95% (96 of 101) after 24 h. The xylose fermentation test is a simple method, easily incorporated into laboratory protocols, that distinguishes E. gallinarum from E. faecium with high sensitivity and specificity in 2 h. The standard MDG test has high sensitivity and can be useful in ruling out the presence of E. gallinarum but requires overnight incubation.
TI  - Enterococci with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin in New Zealand.
AB  - This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in the stools of hospitalized patients with possible antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. From 176 faecal samples collected during 1997 and 1998, 66 strains of enterococci were recovered using vancomycin enrichment techniques. Only six of these displayed reduced susceptibility to vancomycin (MIC 8-12 mg/L). All VRE were positive for the presence of the vanC gene. Based on motility, pigment production and automated Gram-positive identification (GPI Vitek card), four of these six VRE isolates were identified as Enterococcus gallinarum. The remaining two isolates were non-motile and therefore were considered to be Enterococcus faecium. However, 16S rDNA sequence analysis and positive methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside tests indicated that they were non-motile species of E. gallinarum. This is consistent with the intrinsic, low-level vanC-1-mediated resistance associated with this species. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis comparisons between the VRE indicated genetic relatedness between some strains. This work confirms that vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and Enterococcus faecalis are rare in New Zealand.
TI  - A survey of the enterococci isolated from an artisanal Italian goat's cheese (semicotto caprino).
AB  - Enterococci were isolated from semicotto caprino cheese, a traditional cheese produced in Southern Italy: they were a significant part of the microbial population of this cheese, confirming the importance of the presence of these micro-organisms during cheese-making and ripening. They were also identified and studied for their phenotypic and genotypic characteristics: Enterococcus faecalis and Ent. faecium were the most frequently isolated species, followed by Ent. durans, Ent. hirae and Ent. gallinarum. None of the isolates showed lipolytic activity, whereas they were characterized by a relevant proteolytic activity as well as an antagonistic activity towards Listeria innocua. One strain of Ent. gallinarum showed a low-level resistance to vancomycin, while six out of the 79 Ent. faecalis strains possessed beta-haemolysis reaction. The highest acidifying potential in skim milk was obtained by Ent. faecalis isolates. Thirty enterococcal strains representative of the different species at different ripening times were analysed by means of RAPD-PCR, and revealed species-specific profiles for all the considered species.
TI  - Cost-effective algorithm for detection and identification of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in surveillance cultures.
AB  - A study was undertaken to develop an easy-to-use and cost-effective algorithm for the detection and identification of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in surveillance cultures, because the incidence of VRE outbreaks in institutions across Canada has made continuous surveillance a necessity. Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis carry transferable resistance genes and hence are a problem for infection control. In laboratory surveillance, however, Enterococcus gallinarum and Enterococcus casseliflavus, which exhibit low-level nontransferable resistance, are also encountered and often create confusion in identification. Included in this study were a total of 218 strains of enterococci and other streptococci isolated from surveillance cultures. Conventional methods were used to determine their biochemical activities, and speciation was attempted in 121 strains using a rapid multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method that utilized primers for the vanA, B, C1, C2/C3 and ddl genes. The results indicated that by using only a few tests (Gram stain, pyrrolidonyl arylamidase activity, motility, xylose and methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside utilization), Enterococcus faecium/faecalis strains could be accurately differentiated from Enterococcus gallinarum/casseliflavus strains. For the 121 strains on which PCR was performed, there was a 100% correlation with the biochemical identification, with the added advantage that the presence of van genes could be determined at the same time. The cost of identification using minimal biochemical testing and PCR was less than that of identification using automated systems or a battery of conventional biochemical methods. The algorithm presented here may be used in the microbiology laboratory.
TI  - Susceptibility to quinupristin/dalfopristin and other antibiotics of vancomycin-resistant enterococci from the UK, 1997 to mid-1999.
AB  - Susceptibility to quinupristin/dalfopristin and other antibiotics was studied for clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) referred by UK hospitals between January 1997 and June 1999. Single isolates of VRE from 858 patients in 136 hospitals were received, of which 76% were Enterococcus faecium and 21% were Enterococcus faecalis, the remainder comprising minor species. Most isolates were multi-resistant. After allowing for the effect of blood, which raised the MICs of quinupristin/dalfopristin four-fold, 98.3% of E. faecalis isolates and all the Enterococcus avium, Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus gallinarum appeared resistant to quinupristin/dalfopristin, whereas 98.8% of the E. faecium isolates and the single Enterococcus raffinosus isolate were susceptible.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci from hospitalized patients over a 30-month period.
AB  - In February 1996, a Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee-style screening program was commenced to isolate and subsequently characterize glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE) from patients at a hospital trust in Glasgow, Scotland. Over the next 30 months, GRE were isolated from 154 patients. GRE were isolated from patients in traditionally high-risk areas such as the renal unit and intensive care unit and also in areas considered to be lower risk, including medical wards and associated long-stay geriatric hospitals. The majority (90%) of isolates were Enterococcus faecium vanB. The remaining isolates consisted of seven E. faecalis (vanA), three E. gallinarum (vanC), and a further six E. faecium (five vanA, one both vanA and vanB) isolates. Analysis of SmaI-digested DNA by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed that 34 of 40 (85%) VanB E. faecium isolates were identical or closely related, while 11 of 13 (85%) VanA GRE were distinct. High-level aminoglycoside resistance was seen in less than 8% of isolates. VanB E. faecium isolates were almost uniformly resistant to ampicillin and tetracycline. In this study, GRE have been isolated over a prolonged period from a broad range of patients. Glycopeptide resistance within the study hospital trust appeared to be mainly due to the clonal dissemination of a single strain of E. faecium VanB.
TI  - Evaluation of a new system, VITEK 2, for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of enterococci.
AB  - We evaluated the new automated VITEK 2 system (bioMerieux) for the identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of enterococci. The results obtained with the VITEK 2 system were compared to those obtained by reference methods: standard identification by the scheme of Facklam and Sahm [R. R. Facklam and D. F. Sahm, p. 308-314, in P. R. Murray et al., ed., Manual of Clinical Microbiology, 6th ed., 1995] and with the API 20 STREP system and, for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, broth microdilution and agar dilution methods by the procedures of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The presence of vanA and vanB genes was determined by PCR. A total of 150 clinical isolates were studied, corresponding to 60 Enterococcus faecalis, 55 Enterococcus faecium, 26 Enterococcus gallinarum, 5 Enterococcus avium, 2 Enterococcus durans, and 2 Enterococcus raffinosus isolates. Among those isolates, 131 (87%) were correctly identified to the species level with the VITEK 2 system. Approximately half of the misidentifications were for E. faecium with low-level resistance to vancomycin, identified as E. gallinarum or E. casseliflavus; however, a motility test solved the discrepancies and increased the agreement to 94%. Among the strains studied, 66% were vancomycin resistant (57 VanA, 16 VanB, and 26 VanC strains), 23% were ampicillin resistant (MICs, >/=16 microgram/ml), 31% were high-level gentamicin resistant, and 45% were high-level streptomycin resistant. Percentages of agreement for susceptibility and resistance to ampicillin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin and for high-level gentamicin resistance and high-level streptomycin resistance were 93, 95, 97, 97, and 96%, respectively. The accuracy of identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of enterococci with the VITEK 2 system, together with the significant reduction in handling time, will have a positive impact on the work flow of the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - Macrolide resistance genes in Enterococcus spp.
AB  - Seventy-eight isolates of different Enterococcus species (E. faecalis, n = 27; E. faecium, n = 23; E. durans, n = 8; E. avium, n = 6; E. hirae, n = 9; E. gallinarum, n = 3; and E. casseliflavus, n = 2) with a variety of erythromycin resistance phenotypes were examined for the presence of macrolide resistance genes (ermA, ermB, ermC, ermTR, mefA/E, and msrA). Positive PCR amplifications of ermB were obtained for 39 of 40 highly erythromycin-resistant Enterococcus isolates (MICs, >128 microg/ml) of different species; the remaining highly resistant E. faecium isolate was positive for PCR amplification of ermA but was negative for PCR amplification of the ermB and ermC genes. For all enterococcal strains for which erythromycin MICs were < or =32 microg/ml PCRs were negative for erm methylase genes. For all E. faecium isolates PCR amplified products of the expected size of 400 bp were obtained when msrA primers were used, with the results being independent of the erythromycin resistance phenotype. All the other enterococcal species gave negative results by msrA PCRs. Sequencing of the msrA PCR products from either erythromycin-susceptible, low-level-resistant, or highly resistant E. faecium strains showed that the amplicons did not correspond to the msrA gene described for Staphylococcus epidermidis but corresponded to a new putative efflux determinant, which showed 62% identity with the msrA gene at the DNA level and 72% similarity at the amino acid level. This new gene was named msrC.
TI  - Comparison of phenotypic methods to identify enterococci intrinsically resistant  to vancomycin (VanC VRE).
AB  - Clinical laboratories must be able to differentiate between enterococci possessing acquired resistance to vancomycin (vanA and vanB genotypes) from those that are inherently resistant (vanC1 and vanC2/C3 genotypes). We compared several routine phenotypic tests to determine the species identity of clinical isolates of enterococci and a PCR assay for the van ligase genes was used to confirm identification of VanC VRE. The Vitek Gram Positive Identification card identified 53/60 (88%) Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium isolates and 81/141 (57%) VanC VRE without additional testing. Another 32 of the VanC VRE required additional testing (e.g., motility and pigmentation) for correct identification. However, 7 of these 32 VanC VRE were nonmotile. The rapid ID 32 STREP strips identified 50/60 (83%) E. faecalis and E. faecium isolates and 102/141 (72%) VanC VRE. All E. faecalis and E. faecium isolates were nonmotile and did not acidify 1% methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside (MGP). Only 93/115 (81%) E. gallinarum and 21/26 (81%) E. casseliflavus/E. flavescens were motile but all 141 VanC VRE acidified MGP. MGP acidification can accurately differentiate VanC VRE from E. faecalis and E. faecium. Because some VanC VRE isolates are nonmotile, MGP acidification is preferred as a simple and less costly test for identification of these isolates.
TI  - Epidemiology of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci colonizing high-risk patients  in hospitals in Johannesburg, Republic of South Africa.
AB  - Recent cases of infections caused by glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE) have highlighted the emergence of these organisms in the Republic of South Africa. During May 1998 we conducted a prevalence study in four hospitals in Johannesburg and obtained 184 rectal swabs from patients identified as being at high risk for GRE colonization. Twenty enterococcal isolates showing various glycopeptide resistance genotypes were recovered: 3 Enterococcus faecium vanA isolates, 10 E. faecium vanB isolates, 6 E. gallinarum vanC1 isolates, and 1 E. avium vanA isolate. Macrorestriction analysis was used to demonstrate the clonal spread of GRE strains within hospitals. Evidence also demonstrated the likely persistence of the original E. faecium vanA isolate associated with the first confirmed death contributed to by GRE infection in South Africa in March 1997.
TI  - Prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in fecal samples from hospitalized patients and nonhospitalized controls in a cattle-rearing area of France.
AB  - Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have emerged as nosocomial pathogens over  the last decade, but little is known about their epidemiology. We report on the prevalence of VRE fecal colonization on the basis of a prospective study among patients hospitalized in a hematology intensive care unit and among nonhospitalized subjects living in the local community. A total of 243 rectal swabs from hematology patients and 169 stool samples from the control group were inoculated onto bile-esculin agar plates with and without 6 mg of vancomycin per liter and into an enrichment bile-esculin broth supplemented with 4 mg of vancomycin per liter. A total of 37% of the hospitalized patients and 11.8% of the subjects from the community were found to be VRE carriers. A total of 65 VRE strains were isolated: 12 (18.5%) E. faecium, 46 (70.7%) E. gallinarum, and 7 (10.8%) E. casseliflavus strains. No E. faecalis strains were detected. All the E. faecium strains were of the vanA genotype. Molecular typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed a different pattern for each vanA VRE strain that originated from an individual subject. To our knowledge, this is the first study to be carried out in a cattle-rearing region of France. It reports a higher VRE prevalence than that reported in previous European or U.S. studies. A partial explanation is the use of an enrichment broth step which enabled detection of strains which would otherwise have been missed, but the fact that subjects and patients were recruited from a predominantly agricultural area where vancomycin-related antibiotics have recently been used in animal husbandry could also contribute to the high levels of VRE in patients and subjects alike.
TI  - Sequencing the gene encoding manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase for rapid species identification of enterococci.
AB  - Simple PCR and sequencing assays that utilize a single pair of degenerate primers were used to characterize a 438-bp-long DNA fragment internal (sodA(int)) to the sodA gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in 19 enterococcal type strains (Enterococcus avium, Enterococcus casseliflavus, Enterococcus cecorum, Enterococcus columbae, Enterococcus dispar, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus flavescens, Enterococcus gallinarum, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus malodoratus, Enterococcus mundtii, Enterococcus pseudoavium, Enterococcus raffinosus, Enterococcus saccharolyticus, Enterococcus seriolicida, Enterococcus solitarius, and Enterococcus sulfureus). Sequence analysis of the sodA(int) fragments enabled reliable identification of 18 enterococcal species, including E. casseliflavus-E. flavescens and E. gallinarum. The sodA(int) fragments of E. casseliflavus and E. flavescens were almost identical (99.5% sequence identity), which suggests that they should be associated in a single species. Our results confirm that the sodA gene constitutes a more discriminative target sequence than 16S rRNA gene in differentiating closely related bacterial species.
TI  - Prevalence and molecular epidemiology of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci in Belgian renal dialysis units.
AB  - The molecular epidemiology of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE) colonizing the intestinal tracts of Belgian renal dialysis patients was studied among 1318 patients of a population of 1800 dialysis patients from 29 dialysis centers. Of these, 185 patients (14.0%) were colonized with a VANA-positive GRE; GRE harboring the VANB gene were not detected. The majority of the VANA GRE (80.5%) were identified as Enterococcus faecium; 14.8% were identified as E. faecalis; and a limited number were identified as E. avium, E. casseliflavus, E. dispar, E. durans, or E. gallinarum. Genome analysis of 277 VANA-positive GRE by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed a high genetic variability both within the different dialysis centers and within the patients' own GRE flora. No high-level gentamicin-resistant VANA-positive GRE were detected, and most strains remained susceptible to ampicillin. These findings do not support a hospital-driven endemicity of VANA-positive enterococcal isolates in Belgium.
TI  - Characterization of 'faecal streptococci' as indicators of faecal pollution and distribution in the environment.
AB  - The recent revision of the taxonomy of 'faecal streptococci' prompted us to verify the importance of identifying the species of this group of cocci. During a study carried out to assess the hygienic quality of environmental samples from a variety of sources, we isolated 198 strains named faecal streptococci on the basis of conventional international tests (EVA broth multiple tube test) used for Public Health purposes. The predominant species were Enterococcus faecalis (39%) and Ent. faecium (29%), followed by Ent. durans/hirae, Ent. casseliflavus/gallinarum, Ent. raffinosus, with a different prevalence of the species depending on the source. Eighty-four per cent of isolates were true faecal species. Only one isolate was identified as belonging to the Streptococcus genus. The authors stress the opportunity to identify the species. This may help to clarify the ecological and epidemiological characteristics of intestinal enterococci and streptococci in the environment, in drinking and recreational waters and their meaning as indicators of faecal pollution. All isolates were tested for their susceptibility to some antimicrobial agents widely used in medical therapy and the pattern was compared with the pattern of isolates from clinical specimens.
TI  - Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) colonization of high-risk patients in tertiary care Canadian hospitals. Canadian VRE Surveillance Group.
AB  - We isolated 1487 Enterococcus species from 1200 stool specimens collected from high-risk patients in 12 Canadian tertiary care hospitals between October 1995 and November 1996. The composition of the 1487 isolates was 601 vancomycin-sensitive Enterococcus faecalis (40.4%), 667 vancomycin-sensitive Enterococcus faecium (44.9%), 18 vancomycin-resistant (nine isolates MIC 8-16 micrograms/mL; nine isolates MIC > or = 32 micrograms/mL) E. faecium (VREF) (1.2%), 95 vancomycin-sensitive Enterococcus gallinarum (6.4%), 29 vancomycin-resistant (all MICs 8-16 micrograms/mL) E. gallinarum (2.0%), and 77 vancomycin-sensitive Enterococcus casseliflavus (5.2%). Nine of the 18 VREF isolates collected possessed the vanA genotype and were from three patients at one hospital. Two other VREF isolates, of the vanB genotype, were from a single patient at a second hospital, and the remaining seven isolates, also all of the vanB genotype, were from five patients at a third hospital. All VREF were ampicillin resistant (MIC > or = 16 micrograms/mL), streptomycin resistant (MIC > 1000 micrograms/mL), and ciprofloxacin resistant (MIC > or = 4 micrograms/mL). Ten of the 18 VREF were also resistant to gentamicin (MIC > 500 micrograms/mL), while all 18 isolates had quinupristin/dalfopristin MICs < or = 0.5 microgram/mL. In conclusion, high-risk patients in tertiary care Canadian hospitals are rarely colonized (9/1200 patients, 0.75%) with VREF in their lower gastrointestinal tract. These findings correlate well with the lack of reported VREF infection in high-risk patients in Canadian hospitals. Quinupristin/dalfopristin demonstrated excellent in vitro activity against VREF and other non-faecalis species of Enterococcus, many of which also possessed high-level ampicillin, and/or high-level aminoglycoside, and/or ciprofloxacin resistance.
TI  - Evaluation of the revised MicroScan dried overnight gram-positive identification  panel to identify Enterococcus species.
AB  - The revised MicroScan Dried Overnight Gram-Positive Identification panel was evaluated for its efficacy at identifying Enterococcus species in comparison with conventional biochemical tests. Supplemental testing of ampicillin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium for motility and the ability to acidify methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside helped recognize E. gallinarum and increased the accuracy of the panel for identifying Enterococcus species to 98.5%.
TI  - Development of a PCR assay for rapid detection of enterococci.
AB  - Enterococci are becoming major nosocomial pathogens, and increasing resistance to vancomycin has been well documented. Conventional identification methods, which are based on culturing, require 2 to 3 days to provide results. PCR has provided a means for the culture-independent detection of enterococci in a variety of clinical specimens and is capable of yielding results in just a few hours. However, all PCR-based assays developed so far are species specific only for clinically important enterococci. We have developed a PCR-based assay which allows the detection of enterococci at the genus level by targeting the tuf gene, which encodes elongation factor EF-Tu. Initially, we compared the nucleotide sequences of the tuf gene from several bacterial species (available in public databases) and designed degenerate PCR primers derived from conserved regions. These primers were used to amplify a target region of 803 bp from four enterococcal species (Enterococcus avium, E. faecalis, E. faecium, and E. gallinarum). Subsequently, the complete nucleotide sequences of these amplicons were determined. The analysis of a multiple alignment of these sequences revealed regions conserved among enterococci but distinct from those of other bacteria. PCR primers complementary to these regions allowed amplification of genomic DNAs from 14 of 15 species of enterococci tested (E. solitarius DNA could not be amplified). There was no amplification with a majority of 79 nonenterococcal bacterial species, except for 2 Abiotrophia species and several Listeria species. Furthermore, this assay efficiently amplified all 159 clinical isolates of enterococci tested (61 E. faecium, 77 E. faecalis, 9 E. gallinarum, and 12 E. casseliflavus isolates). Interestingly, the preliminary sequence comparison of the amplicons for four enterococcal species demonstrated that there were some sequence variations which may be used to generate species-specific internal probes. In conclusion, this rapid PCR-based assay is capable of detecting all clinically important enterococci and has potential for use in clinical microbiology laboratories.
TI  - Vancomycin-resistant enterococci isolates from the rumen content of deer.
AB  - The total enumeration of enterococci from the rumen content of deer, their species determination, resistance to antibiotics with the predominant importance of vancomycin resistance, and their metabolic properties, were examined. Enterococci (2.0 x 10(2) CFU per ml) encountered from the rumen of deer were phenotypically allotted to the species Enterococcus casseliflavus (26.6%), E. gallinarum (26.6%) and E. faecium (6.6%). The other isolates were not phenotypically specified. Although the resistance to the other antibiotics was recorded, the emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in a high percentage (60%) was revealed. The majority of strains (80%) were multiresistant with the predominant resistance shown by vancomycin. These strains produced lactic acid in the range from 0.258 mol l-1 up to 0.489 mol l-1, and most of the isolates (53.3%) manifested medium urease activity. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci were selected for other studies such as plasmid determination and bacteriocin production, and to assess their value as indicators of faecal contamination.
TI  - Comparison of direct and enrichment methods for the selective isolation of vancomycin-resistant enterococci from feces of pigs and poultry.
AB  - Isolation results of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) of fecal samples from pigs and broiler and layer chickens obtained with two vancomycin-supplemented enrichment media, kanamycin aesculin azide (KAA) broth and Enterococcosel (ECC) broth, and three isolation media, KAA agar, ECC agar, and Slanetz and Bartley (SL) agar, were compared. Direct isolation on vancomycin-containing agar plates was not efficient in swine and layer chickens, which had only low numbers of VRE. In broilers chickens, the VRE content of the samples was high, and SL as well as ECC were found to perform better than KAA agar. The same three agar media were used as selective plating media after 1 and 2 days incubation of the samples in KAA and ECC enrichment broths. Sensitivities of the 12 different enrichment-plate combinations tested ranged from 0 to 81% in layer chickens and from 5 to 44% in samples from pigs. In the high prevalence type of samples from broilers, sensitivities still varied substantially from 52 to 78%. Incubating vancomycin-containing enrichment broths for 2 days compared with 1 day was favorable for the isolation of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, E. gallinarum, and E. casseliflavus but not for E. faecium and E. hirae/E. durans. ECC broth and ECC plates yielded the highest number of E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus. In layer as well as in broiler chickens, ECC broth incubated for 2 days and plated on ECC agar was the most sensitive method. In pigs, however, KAA broth incubated for 2 days and plated on ECC medium yielded the highest number of VRE.
TI  - Antagonistic effect of Enterococcus faecium J96 against human and poultry pathogenic Salmonella spp.
AB  - Production of antagonistic compounds was studied in a strain of Enterococcus faecium isolated from the intestinal tract of a free-ranging chicken. Production of lactic acid and a bacteriocin was observed in cultures of this bacterium, alone and in mixed culture fermentations with pathogenic Salmonella serotypes (i.e., Gallinarum, Pullorum, Enteritidis, and Typhimurium). Growth inhibition of these avian and human pathogens was observed after 4 h of incubation at 37 degrees C in CAm broth, a medium developed according to the nutrients present in chicken food. The antibacterial action was due to the combined effect of lactic acid and bacteriocin. Accumulation of these metabolites caused both a bacteriostatic and a bactericidal action against the gram-negative bacteria assayed.
TI  - Cloning of insertion sequence IS1485 from Enterococcus species.
AB  - We have cloned and identified an insertion sequence, IS1485, that was present in  several members of the genus Enterococcus. IS1485 exists in varying copy numbers with at least 12 copies in E. durans (ATCC 11576), 3 copies in E. faecium (ATCC 19434), and one copy each in E. faecalis (ATCC 19433) and E. avium (ATCC 14024). It was also detected in clinical strains of E. gallinarum, E. casseliflavus, and E. saccharolyticus. IS1485 is 1366 bp in length, it has imperfect terminal inverted repeats with 25 of the terminal 39 residues matched, and it contains three open reading frames exceeding 50 codons, designated orfA, orfB, and orfC. The largest, orfB, was located 36 bp downstream and in the -1 reading frame relative to orfA; orfC is oriented in the opposite direction and overlaps orfA. The genetic organization of IS1485 resembles that of members of the IS3 family of transposable elements. Sequence homology exists with several members of the IS3 family especially with IS199 from Streptococcus mutans.
TI  - Identification of clinically isolated vancomycin-resistant enterococci: comparison of API and BBL Crystal systems.
AB  - Twenty-eight phenotypically separate strains of clinically isolated vancomycin-resistant enterococci have been investigated with two API identification kit systems (20 Strep and Rapid ID 32 Strep) and two BBL Crystal kits (Gram Positive and Rapid Gram Positive). All strains were identified as Enterococcus faecium by a reference laboratory. The Rapid ID 32 kit positively identified 15 of 28 strains (54%), but only two (7%) were identified correctly: 11 were identified as 'doubtful' or 'to genus level' and two gave 'unacceptable' profiles. The API 20 Strep kit identified 27 strains (96%), but only 16 (57%) were identified correctly as E. faecium. The Rapid ID 32 kit erred by either positively misidentifying vancomycin-resistant E. faecium as E. casseliflavus or E. gallinarum, or indicated that this was the most likely identification, while the API 20 Strep kit more commonly produced a misidentification as E. casseliflavus. The Crystal Gram Positive and Rapid Gram Positive kits correctly identified 26 (93%) and 27 (96%) of the strains, respectively.
TI  - Practical approach to the identification of clinically relevant Enterococcus species.
AB  - Enterococci have become important nosocomial pathogens, with Enterococcus faecalis and then Enterococcus faecium predominating. Because of the emergence of glycopeptide (vancomycin and teicoplanin) resistance in enterococci, laboratories have been required to screen for resistant strains and to identify them to the species level. This has resulted in the need for accurate identification of species less commonly associated with clinical infections, such as Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus gallinarum, which are inherently resistant to the glycopeptides. Studies evaluating commonly used commercial identification systems, have found error rates for enterococcal species identification of 2-21% for E. faecalis, 5-9% for E. faecium, and 14-79% for other species. Reporting errors may have adverse effects on the management of clinical infections, as well as in the control of multidrug-resistant strain outbreaks. The purpose of this document is to present a simplified approach to the identification of Enterococcus species that uses a combination of rapid, readily available, and inexpensive tests.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of Enterococcus faecium, PRSP and MRSA to RP59500 and their correlations with those to other drugs].
AB  - Investigations on emergence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) which has recently been attracting attention, especially in the Western countries, have been conducted in Japan. A total of 1,239 isolates of E. faecium were collected from 19 institutions during the period of April 1995 and June 1996, in the purpose of evaluating susceptibilities to variety of antimicrobial agents, including RP59500 and vancomycin (VCM), and detecting vancomycin-resistant genes (van genes). Susceptibilities of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were also studied. As a result, 2 isolates of E. faecium were found to be moderately resistant to VCM showing MIC of 8 micrograms/ml though the final identification in species level and the detection of van genes by PCR method have not been completed. On the other hand there detected no MRSA nor PRSP showing moderately resistant or resistant to VCM. It was concluded that RP59500 and VCM possessed favorable activity against clinically isolated E. faecium, PRSP and MRSA. Among other species of enterococci, moderately resistant strains to VCM showing MIC of 8 micrograms/ml were detected; 10 isolates of E. gallinarum, 4 of E. casseliflavus and 2 of E. flavescens. In those isolates, vanC1 and vanC2 were detected by PCR, and vanB was also detected in a isolates of E. gallinarum simultaneously.
TI  - Efficacy of hand disinfectants against vancomycin-resistant enterococci in vitro.
AB  - Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) may be spread within a hospital via the contaminated hands of the healthcare worker. Effective hand disinfectants are necessary to break chains of transmission. We determined the bactericidal activity of 1-propanol, chlorhexidine digluconate (0.5 and 4%). Sterillium (45% 2-propanol, 30% 1-propanol and 0.2% mecetronium etilsulphate), Skinsept F (70% 2-propanol, 0.5% chlorhexidine digluconate and 0.45% hydrogen peroxide) and Hibisol (70% 2-propanol and 0.5% chlorhexidine gluconate) against 11 clonally distinct enterococcal isolates in a quantitative suspension test. Four isolates were vancomycin susceptible, four were vanA and the remainder vanB positive. Eight isolates were identified as Enterococcus faecium, two as Enterococcus faecalis and one as Enterococcus gallinarum. The investigator was blinded to the species and the genotype. Four parallel experiments were carried out for each isolate, each preparation, each dilution and each reaction time. 1-Propanol (60%), Sterillium, Skinsept F and Hibisol were all highly bactericidal after 15 and 30 s against VRE and vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (VSE) with reduction factors (RF) > 6.4, even in dilution of 50% (v/v). No significant difference was observed between vanA isolates, vanB isolates and VSE. Chlorhexidine digluconate (0.5% and 4%) was found to be less bactericidal after 30, 60 and 300 sec (RF < or = 2.5). The vanB genotype isolates were found to be significantly more susceptible to chlorhexidine (0.5%) than the vanA isolates (60 sec; one-way ANOVA model; P = 0.05). After 300 sec the vanB genotype isolates were found to be significantly more susceptible to chlorhexidine (0.5%) than the other two genotype isolates (P = 0.016). The vanA isolates were found to be significantly more susceptible to chlorhexidine (4%) than the vanB isolates (300 s; P = 0.024). E. faecium was found to be less susceptible to chlorhexidine than E. faecalis at all concentrations and reaction times, but significant differences between RF were only observed at 60 sec for both chlorhexidine concentrations (P < 0.05; t-test for independent samples). Propanol is much more effective against enterococci than chlorhexidine and combination of the two may be useful in providing an immediate and long lasting effect.
TI  - Proficiency of clinical laboratories in Spain in detecting vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. The Spanish VRE Study Group.
AB  - Studies in a variety of U.S. clinical laboratories have demonstrated difficulty in detecting intermediate and low-level vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). The misclassification of "at least intermediate resistant isolates" as vancomycin susceptible may have both clinical implications and a negative impact on measures to control the spread of VRE. No published study has assessed the ability of clinical laboratories in Europe to detect VRE. So, the apparent low prevalence of VRE in European hospitals may be, in part, secondary to the inability of these laboratories to detect all VRE. In an effort to assess European laboratories' proficiency in detecting VRE, we identified 22 laboratories in Spain and asked them to test four VRE strains and one susceptible enterococcal strain from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collection. Each organism was tested by the routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing method used by each laboratory. Overall, VRE were correctly identified in 61 of 88 (69.1%) instances. The accuracy of VRE detection varied with the level of resistance and the antimicrobial susceptibility method. The high-level-resistant strain (Enterococcus faecium; MIC, 512 microg/ml) was accurately detected in 20 of 22 (91. 3%) instances, whereas the intermediate-resistant isolate (Enterococcus gallinarum; MIC, 8 microg/ml) was accurately detected in only 11 of 22 (50%) instances. Classification errors occurred in 27 of 88 (30.9%) instances. Misclassification as vancomycin susceptible was the most common error (16 of 27 [59.3%] instances). Our study shows that the participating Spanish laboratories had an overall acceptable proficiency in detecting VRE but that a substantial proportion of VRE isolates with low or intermediate levels of resistance were not detected. We recommend that studies be conducted to validate laboratory proficiency testing as an important step in the prevention and control of the spread of antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Detection of clinical vancomycin-resistant enterococci in Denmark by multiplex PCR and sandwich hybridization.
AB  - Since the first cases of human infection with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) were reported in the late eighties, there has been a dramatic increase in VRE all over the world. So far, there have not been any reports of clinical VRE in Denmark. In this study we have investigated 131 clinically important enterococci sent to Statens Serum Institut from all over Denmark during the period July 1995 to May 1997. The susceptibility to vancomycin, teicoplanin, ampicillin and gentamicin was tested by the agar dilution method. In addition, two methods were developed to detect the different genotypes of glycopeptide resistance described in enterococci: a multiplex PCR assay for detection of vanA, vanB, vanC-1, vanC-2/3 ligase genes including 16S rRNA gene control primers and a sandwich hybridization assay to confirm vanA and vanB PCR-positive strains. The highest frequency of resistance to the tested antibiotics was found in the Enterococcus faecium group. Four strains were found with acquired resistance to glycopeptides: one E. faecium and one E. gallinarum were vanA positive, and two E. faecium isolates were vanB positive. These strains were isolated from different hospitals in different periods of time, and all patients recovered from their infections with VRE. Today, the PCR and sandwich hybridization methods are used for screening of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in humans as part of the Danish surveillance programme.
TI  - Comparison of direct plating and broth enrichment culture for the detection of intestinal colonization by glycopeptide-resistant enterococci among hospitalized patients.
AB  - The results of prevalence studies on glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE) in  the intestine may be influenced by the detection methods applied. In most studies different media, different concentrations of antibiotics, and different methods are used, and these differences result in differences in recovery rates. In this cross-sectional study on the carrier state of GRE among patients at the University Hospital Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium, performed on 21 May 1996, direct plating and broth enrichment were compared by using the same media. Stool samples (n = 213) or rectal swabs (n = 122) were plated directly on Enterococcosel agar (bioMerieux) and after enrichment in Enterococcosel broth. The prevalence of GRE was 12.8%. Direct plating recovered 53.4% of the GRE isolates, and broth enrichment recovered an additional 46.5% of them; in the latter test the isolates were thus present at less than 10(3) CFU per g of feces. The prevalence of GRE among dialysis patients was higher than among the other patients, but the difference was not significant (P = 0.06), possibly as a result of the small numbers of dialysis patients examined. The GRE species isolated included 19 E. gallinarum (44.2%), 13 E. faecium (30.2%), 6 E. faecalis (13.9%), and 5 E. casseliflavus (11.6%) isolates. All E. faecalis and E. faecium strains isolated carried the vanA gene, and E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus carried the vanC1 and vanC2 gene, respectively. The majority of isolates were polyclonal. Our data indicate that the rate of detection of GRE from both stool samples and rectal swabs is significantly increased with enrichment cultures.
TI  - Low faecal carrier rate of vancomycin resistant enterococci in Norwegian hospital patients.
AB  - The faecal carrier rate of vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) was surveyed among 616 patients in selected departments of 7 Norwegian hospitals. One Enterococcus gallinarum isolate harbouring a vanB2 element was recovered from a child with malignant disease treated with vancomycin and ceftazidime. No vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecalis or Enterococcus faecium were detected and no VRE isolates of the VanA type were identified. The low level of VRE carriage corresponds to the limited use of glycopeptide antibiotics for human therapeutic purposes in Norway. It indicates a low risk of acquiring VRE infections in Norwegian hospitals.
TI  - Comparison of simple and rapid methods for identifying enterococci intrinsically  resistant to vancomycin.
AB  - Three different methodologies, reduction of litmus milk (LM) and acidification of arabinose (ARA), acidification of methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside (MGP), and rapid motility (RM), for differentiating isolates of Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus gallinarum (intrinsically vancomycin-resistant enterococci [IVRE]) from Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium were evaluated. All 33 isolates of E. faecalis tested reduced LM within 4 h and were negative in all other tests, while the 53 isolates of E. faecium were ARA positive only. In contrast, 45 of 46 (98%) IVRE isolates examined (26 E. casseliflavus and 20 E. gallinarum isolates) acidified MGP, 41 of 46 (89%) were LM and ARA positive, and 45 of 46 (98%) were RM positive. Acidification of MGP was therefore the single most useful test for differentiating IVRE from vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and E. faecalis; however, a combination of LM-ARA and RM testing enabled the correct designation of organisms without the need for overnight incubation.
TI  - [Bacteremia due to vancomycin-resistant enterococci in neutropenic cancer patients].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the incidence, clinical characteristics and outcome of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included all cases of enterococcal bacteremia in neutropenic cancer patients documented between January 1986 and December 1995 in a 1,000-bed university hospital, where a prospective surveillance of all cases of bacteremia is regularly done. Molecular typing was performed on all vancomycin-resistant strains with the analysis of chromosomic DNA by macrorestriction. RESULTS: Seventeen cases of enterococcal bacteremia were documented. Seven (41%) were caused by vancomycin-resistant strains (E. faecium 3 and E. gallinarum 4), six of which occurred in the last 5 years of the study period. The average age of patients was 43 years (18-69) and most of them had acute leukemia. Eighty percent of these patients had received vancomycin and/or cephalosporins within 2 weeks prior to bacteremia. Previous administration of antibiotics was more frequent in patients with bacteremia caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci than in those with bacteremia caused by susceptible strains (86% vs 30%; p < 0.05). The mean number of previous antibiotics (2.4 vs 0.8; p < 0.05) as well as days of treatment (13.6 vs 4.3; p = 0.05) were also higher among patients with resistant enterococcal bacteremia. The overall mortality was 57%. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the emergence of sporadic cases of bacteremia caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci in neutropenic cancer patients in our area. This fact seems to be related with the previous administration of antibiotics and advice that a rational use of these agents is needed.
TI  - [Vancomycin resistant enterococcus in France. High prevalence in a young ambulatory care patient population].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Assess the prevalence of asymptomatic carriage of vancomycin-resistant Enterococci in a population of healthy young French subjects. METHODS: Stool samples obtained from 100 persons living in south-eastern France (20 sampling sites) were directly seeded on enriched selective media containing 6 mg/l vancomycin. Bacterial species and their resistant gene were identified with classical methods and multiplex genomic amplification. RESULTS: The incidence of asymptomatic carriage was 17% with a homogeneous geographic distribution of the resistant strains. Nine Enterococcus faecium van A strains and 8 E. gallinarum van C1 strains were isolated. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate carriage of vancomycin-resistant Enterococci in a population of young ambulatory subjects in France. The incidence observed was much higher than in an earlier study conducted in France. These results might be explained by a much more sensitive detection technique. Care should be taken to avoid dissemination in hospital settings.
TI  - Determination of 16S rRNA sequences of enterococci and application to species identification of nonmotile Enterococcus gallinarum isolates.
AB  - The 16S rRNA sequences of enterococcal species E. faecium, E. faecalis, E. gallinarum, E. casseliflavus/flavescens, E. dispar, E. pseudoavium, E. sulfureus, E. malodoratus, E. raffinosus, E. cecorum, E. hirae, E. saccharolyticus, E. seriolicida, E. mundtii, E. avium, E. durans, E. columbae, and E. solitarius are presented herein. These data were utilized to confirm the species identification of two nonmotile E. gallinarum isolates which had been previously phenotypically identified as E. faecium. The implications of this finding are discussed.
TI  - Screening of stool samples for identification of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus isolates should include the methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside test to differentiate nonmotile Enterococcus gallinarum from E. faecium.
AB  - The methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside (MDG) test has been shown to be superior to motility testing in differentiating Enterococcus faecium from E. gallinarum. In the present study, 33 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) isolates collected as part of a stool surveillance study were compared by using motility and MDG. Motility testing identified all 33 isolates as E. faecium, whereas MDG identified 11 of the 33 isolates as nonmotile E. gallinarum. The MDG results were confirmed by sequencing the 16S rDNA V6-to-V8 region. We conclude that the MDG test is a necessary component of routine VRE screening.
TI  - Effects of different test conditions on MICs of food animal growth-promoting antibacterial agents for enterococci.
AB  - The influence of the addition of sheep blood to Mueller-Hinton II agar and the effects of aerobic incubation with or without CO2 and of anaerobic incubation were tested with bacitracin, tylosin, avoparcin, virginiamycin, avilamycin, narasin, and flavomycin on enterococci. The antibacterial activity of bambermycin (Flavomycin) was strongly inhibited by the addition of blood, except with the species Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus mundtii, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus casseliflavus, and Enterococcus gallinarum, which were not susceptible to this antibiotic on blood-free medium. With all other antimicrobials except avoparcin and tylosin, the presence of blood resulted in MIC increases of 1 to 3 log2 differences. Incubation in aerobic or anaerobic atmospheres enriched with CO2 lowered the susceptibility of enterococci to tylosin and increased their susceptibility to avilamycin, narasin, and avoparcin. This effect was most pronounced in tests on blood-free media. Results of susceptibility tests incubated under anaerobiosis and in a CO2-enriched atmosphere did not differ. For all enterococcal species, the preferred conditions for testing the susceptibility are Mueller-Hinton II medium supplemented with blood and incubation in a CO2-enriched atmosphere. However, when only E. faecium and Enterococcus faecalis are being tested, Mueller-Hinton II medium without blood incubated aerobically gives satisfactory results.
TI  - Characterization of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci from a Swiss hospital.
AB  - Between August 1994 and September 1996, 28 glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE) were isolated from 8 infected patients and 11 intestinal carriers hospitalized at the University Hospital of Geneva. Identification to the species was made by both phenotypic (API 20 STREP and Rapid ID 32 STREP systems, and Vitek Gram Positive Identification Card) and genotypic methods using a multiplex PCR assay developed also for the determination of the genotype of glycopeptide resistance (vanA, vanB, vanC1, and vanC2-C3 genes). Fifteen isolates were identified as Enterococcus faecium, 8 as E. gallinarum, 4 as E. faecalis, and 1 as E. hirae. All of the phenotypic identification methods failed to differentiate some isolates of E. gallinarum from E. faecium, or vice versa. Both vanA (n = 18) and vanB (n = 4) glycopeptide resistance genotypes were found. For the first time, the vanB determinant was found in two isolates of E. gallinarum. Two patients were colonized by two different species containing the vanA gene and one by two different species containing the vanB gene. All vanA isolates were highly resistant to both vancomycin and teicoplanin except for three isolates which were susceptible to teicoplanin. Molecular typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed identical or similar patterns among E. faecium isolates with the vanA gene in five patients for whom the epidemiological link could not be always elucidated. This study emphasizes the necessity of utilizing both phenotypic and genotypic methods to characterize GRE.
TI  - Use of tests for acidification of methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside and susceptibility to efrotomycin for differentiation of strains of Enterococcus and some related genera.
AB  - A total of 107 Enterococcus strains, 10 Vagococcus fluvialis strains, and 8 Lactococcus garvieae strains were tested for acidification of methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside (MGP) and susceptibility to 100-microg efrotomycin (EFRO) disks. All 26 strains of Enterococcus casseliflavus, including 3 nonmotile and 2 nonpigmented strains, acidified MGP and were resistant to EFRO. All 22 strains of Enterococcus gallinarum, including 5 nonmotile strains, also acidified MGP and were resistant to EFRO. None of the 26 strains of Enterococcus faecium acidified MGP, and all were susceptible to EFRO. Although all 12 Enterococcus faecalis strains were also negative in the MGP test, they were resistant to EFRO. Other enterococcal strains gave variable results. All 10 strains of V. fluvialis and all 8 strains of L. garvieae gave positive and negative results, respectively, in the MGP test and were, respectively, resistant and susceptible to EFRO. These results indicate that tests of the production of acid from MGP and susceptibility to EFRO can be used as adjunct tests in the identification of typical and atypical strains of enterococci in the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - Identification of clinically important species of Enterococcus within 1 day with  randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD).
AB  - The use of randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) for rapid, reliable, and easily interpreted identification of enterococci was evaluated. Nineteen type strains of Enterococcus, 12 reference strains, and 114 clinical isolates of Enterococcus were analyzed. Discrimination was obtained between most type strains, the exceptions being Ent. casseliflavus and Ent. flavescens, which had relatively similar RAPD-profiles. Ent. faecalis and Ent. faecium were readily separated, and Ent. gallinarum and Ent. durans could also be identified. Extracts to be used in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were prepared directly from agar plate colonies, which made it possible to complete the identification procedure in one day. RAPD was proved to be a fast and reliable method for identification of most Enterococcus spp. of clinical significance.
TI  - Comparative in vitro and bactericidal activity of oxazolidinone antibiotics against multidrug-resistant enterococci.
AB  - Increasing resistance among enterococci poses a considerable therapeutic problem. In this study, we evaluated the comparative in vitro activity of two investigational oxazolidinone antibiotics, eperezolid and linezolid, versus clinical isolates of multidrug-resistant enterococci. One hundred isolates (16 Enterococcus faecalis, 69 E. faecium, 10 E. gallinarum, 2 E. casseliflavus, 1 E. avium, 1 E. hirae, and 1 E. raffinosus) evaluated were collected from diverse geographic areas in North America and Europe from 1991 to 1995. Eperezolid MIC50 and MIC90 were 1.0 microgram/mL and 2.0 micrograms/mL (1.0-2.0 micrograms/mL range). Linezolid MIC50 and MIC90 were 2.0 micrograms/mL and 2.0 micrograms/mL (0.5-2.0 micrograms/mL range), respectively. MICs were the same at 10(3) CFU/mL and 10(8) CFU/mL initial inoculum. In time-kill experiments using 10 strains and concentrations of 4 micrograms/mL, 8 micrograms/mL, and 16 micrograms/mL (achievable serum concentrations) of eperezolid and linezolid there was a 2 log10 reduction of growth for 2 of 10 isolates tested using eperezolid and a 1 log10 reduction for 50% of isolates with both agents. There was indifferent bactericidal killing when either oxazolidinone was combined with gentamicin, ampicillin, or streptomycin for isolates lacking these resistances. This study demonstrates these oxazolidinone agents to have excellent in vitro activity versus multidrug-resistant enterococci.
TI  - Comparison of agar dilution, broth microdilution, E-test, disk diffusion, and automated Vitek methods for testing susceptibilities of Enterococcus spp. to vancomycin.
AB  - An evaluation was undertaken to determine the optimal method for testing the susceptibilities of 100 clinical isolates and two reference strains of Enterococcus spp. to vancomycin in vitro. Six testing methods were studied by using the following media and incubation times: agar screen with the Synergy Quad Plate (Remel, Lenexa, Kans.), an in-house-prepared brain heart infusion (BHI) agar plate, and an in-house-prepared Mueller-Hinton (MH) agar plate, all incubated for 24 or 48 h; broth microdilution (Sensititre Just One Strip; AccuMed International, Inc., West Lake, Ohio) with BHI or cation-adjusted MH broth incubated for 24 or 48 h; agar dilution with BHI or MH agar incubated for 24 or 48 h; epsilometer test (E test; AB BioDisk, Solna, Sweden) with BHI or MH agar incubated for 24 or 48 h; disk diffusion with BHI or MH agar incubated for 24 or 48 h; and the automated Vitek method with the gram-positive susceptibility Staphylococcus aureus card and R02.03 software (bioMerieux, Inc., Hazelwood, Mo.). Growth failures occurred with MH media (n = 6) but not with BHI media. One growth failure occurred with the Vitek method. Results for each testing method for each Enterococcus strain were interpreted as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant according to current National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) criteria and compared to the vancomycin resistance genotype (i.e., vanA, vanB, vanC-1, or vanC-2/3). For all methods, extension of the incubation time from 24 h to 48 h either produced no difference in the results or gave poorer results. The following methods produced no very major or major interpretive errors: broth microdilution with BHI media incubated for 24 h, agar dilution with BHI media incubated for 24 or 48 h, and E test with BHI media incubated for 24 or 48 h. Unacceptable frequencies of very major errors (> 1%) occurred with all methods for which MH media were used. Minor interpretive errors were frequent with all methods. These minor interpretive errors also occurred most frequently with Enterococcus strains with vanC genes, which encoded low-level vancomycin resistance (MIC < or = 8 microg/ml), as opposed to Enterococcus strains which possessed vanA or vanB genes, which encoded higher-level vancomycin resistance (MIC > or = 64 microg/ml). Modification of NCCLS breakpoints, especially for motile Enterococcus spp. (E. casseliflavus, E. flavescens, and E. gallinarum), may resolve this problem; however, in the current study, one E. faecalis strain and one E. faecium strain carried only the vanC gene. The agar screen method may also require reformulation. The current agar screen plate contains 6 microg of vancomycin per ml, which may not detect all low-level resistance associated with vanC genotypes. Nevertheless, the clinical significance of this low-level vancomycin resistance remains unknown.
TI  - Are clinical laboratories in California accurately reporting vancomycin-resistant enterococci?
AB  - In order to determine whether hospital-based clinical laboratories conducting active surveillance for vancomycin-resistant enterococci in three San Francisco Bay area counties (San Francisco, Alameda, and Contra Costa counties) were accurately reporting vancomycin resistance, five vancomycin-resistant enterococcal strains and one vancomycin-susceptible beta-lactamase-producing enterococcus were sent to 31 of 32 (97%) laboratories conducting surveillance. Each strain was tested by the laboratory's routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing method. An Enterococcus faecium strain with high-level resistance to vancomycin (MIC, 512 microg/ml) was correctly reported as resistant by 100% of laboratories; an E. faecium strain with moderate-level resistance (MIC, 64 microg/ml) was correctly reported as resistant by 91% of laboratories; two Enterococcus faecalis strains with low-level resistance (MICs, 32 microg/ml) were correctly reported as resistant by 97 and 56% of laboratories, respectively. An Enterococcus gallinarum strain with intrinsic low-level resistance (MIC, 8 microg/ml) was correctly reported as intermediate by 50% of laboratories. A beta-lactamase-producing E. faecalis isolate was correctly identified as susceptible to vancomycin by 100% of laboratories and as resistant to penicillin and ampicillin by 68 and 44% of laboratories, respectively; all 23 (74%) laboratories that tested for beta-lactamase recognized that it was a beta-lactamase producer. This survey indicated that for clinically significant enterococcal isolates, laboratories in the San Francisco Bay area have problems in detecting low- to moderate-level but not high-level vancomycin resistance. Increasing accuracy of detection and prompt reporting of these isolates and investigation of cases are the next steps in the battle for control of the spread of vancomycin resistance.
TI  - Effect of vancomycin on intestinal flora of patients who previously received antimicrobial therapy.
AB  - To evaluate the ecological disturbances of peroral vancomycin administration following cephalosporin administration, 20 healthy volunteers received cefuroxime axetil tablets (250 mg) perorally twice a day for 1 week, and 10 of these volunteers subsequently received vancomycin capsules (125 mg) perorally four times daily for 7 days. The concentration of vancomycin in feces after 1 week of vancomycin administration was high (mean +/- SD, 520 +/- 197 mg/kg), which correlated with the ecological disturbances noted in the vancomycin recipients. Vancomycin administration resulted in a rapid decrease in the numbers of intestinal Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus durans (P < or = .05), while there was a significant emergence of motile enterococci with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin (Enterococcus gallinarum and Enterococcus casseliflavus; minimum inhibitory concentration, 4-16 mg/L) (P < or = .01). Because of vancomycin administration, there was also a significant overgrowth of vancomycin-resistant Pediococcus species and lactobacilli as well as of Klebsiella species, Citrobacter species, and Enterobacter species (P < or = .01). The numbers of bifidobacteria and Bacteroides species were significantly reduced during vancomycin administration. None of the enterococcal strains carried vanA or vanB. Twenty-two of the 27 motile enterococci carried the vanC-1 gene specific for E. gallinarum, whereas five strains carried the vanC-2(C-3) gene, thus implicating that they were E. casseliflavus or Enterococcus flavescens.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology and antibiotic susceptibility of enterococci in Cincinnati, Ohio: a prospective citywide survey.
AB  - To determine patterns of antimicrobial susceptibility among enterococci and to assess molecular characteristics of vancomycin-resistant enterococci, 157 clinical blood isolates of enterococci from 10 hospitals in Cincinnati, Ohio, were prospectively collected during a 6-month period from February to July 1995. The isolates included 108 (69%) E. faecalis isolates, 46 (29%) E. faecium isolates, and 1 isolate each of E. avium, E. durans, and E. gallinarum. The E. faecalis and E. faecium isolates differed in their susceptibilities to ampicillin (100 versus 20%), ampicillin-sulbactam (100 versus 13%), vancomycin (100 versus 57%), imipenem (94 versus 2%), and high levels of gentamicin (59 versus 83%). Supplemental susceptibility testing of the 21 vancomycin-resistant isolates showed that 21 (100%) were susceptible to chloramphenicol and that only 7 (33%) were susceptible to doxycycline. Nineteen (90%) of the vancomycin-resistant E. faecium isolates were of the VanB phenotype, with vanB resistance genes detected by PCR and hybridization with gene-specific probes; and the E. gallinarum isolates demonstrated the VanC phenotype with the vanC1 gene. One vancomycin-resistant E. faecium isolate was highly resistant to both teicoplanin and vancomycin, corresponding to the VanA phenotype; however, it was found to have the vanB gene. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) revealed that all of the 19 E. faecium isolates with the VanB phenotype had identical to closely related banding patterns. Hybridization of restriction enzyme-digested DNA separated by PFGE with a vanB gene probe demonstrated differences in the locations of vanB genes that corresponded closely to the PFGE banding patterns. Our study has documented that the emerging vancomycin resistance in our city was mainly due to the clonal dissemination of a single strain of E. faecium VanB.
TI  - Rapid characterization schemes for surveillance isolates of vancomycin-resistant  enterococci.
AB  - Surveillance cultures for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and subsequent characterization of the isolates can be extremely burdensome and difficult. Therefore, efficient and reliable schemes for the characterization of surveillance isolates are needed. In this study, a commercial agar (bile esculin azide agar with 6 microg of vancomycin per ml [BEAA]; Remel, Lenexa, Kans.) was used in the initial screening step to establish relatively rapid (i.e., in < or = 24 h from the time of isolation) phenotype-based and PCR-based schemes for the detection and characterization of VRE. The phenotype-based scheme included Gram staining of growth on BEAA and subculture of cocci on sheep blood agar plates for vancomycin disk diffusion and pyrazinamidase (PYR) testing. For the PCR scheme, inocula for van gene detection were taken directly from the BEAA plates. The phenotypic approach was applied to 378 surveillance cultures that yielded growth on BEAA. Gram staining quickly eliminated gram-positive bacilli from further testing, and a negative PYR test classified 25 additional isolates as probable pediococci. A positive PYR test reliably identified 121 single-patient VRE isolates that included 83 Enterococcus faecium, 33 E. gallinarum, and 5 E. casseliflavus strains. The vancomycin inhibition zone size clearly distinguished VanA and VanB strains from VanC strains within 24 h of BEAA isolation. All VanA and VanB strains failed to produce zones of >6 mm, while only one VanC strain produced a zone of < 15 mm. Challenging this phenotypic scheme with 47 stock VRE isolates produced similar findings. In direct PCR analyses, false-negative vanA and vanB results occurred with 12% of the specimens. Many of the false-negative reactions also failed to produce an internal control product, which underscores the need for including control primers when a PCR scheme is used. In summary, the phenotype- and the PCR-based schemes provide efficient methods for characterizing VRE within 24 h of isolation.
TI  - Surveillance for antimicrobial resistance in enterococci.
AB  - AIM: To describe antimicrobial resistance patterns of Enterococcus species in Auckland. BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistant enterococci have emerged as major nosocomial pathogens in overseas hospitals. It is recommended that hospitals perform periodic surveys to determine local enterococcal resistance patterns. METHODS: Enterococcal isolates from four patient groups were tested: group I were recovered from routine clinical specimens; group II were stool isolates from patients at risk of having vancomycin resistant enterococci, eg, intensive care unit patients, patients receiving vancomycin, and immunocompromised patients receiving antibiotics; group III were enterococci from stool specimens sent for Clostridium difficile toxin testing; group IV were isolates from stool specimens submitted to a community laboratory for enteric pathogen testing. All enterococci isolated were tested for the presence of beta-lactamase, susceptibility to amoxycillin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, and for high level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance. RESULTS: There were 121 group I enterococcal isolates. 628 stool specimens were cultured. Enterococci were isolated from: 76/148 (51%) group II specimens; 166/279 (60%) group III specimens; and 70/201 (35%) of group IV specimens. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on 433 isolates; 74% were E faecalis, 12% E faecium, 6% E gallinarum/casseliflavus group and 8% other enterococcal species. No isolate produced beta-lactamase. All E faecalis were susceptible to amoxycillin. Two E faecium and one enterococcus species were resistant to amoxycillin (MICs all 16 mg/L). All isolates were susceptible to teicoplanin. Fourteen E gallinarum/casseliflavus group isolates had intermediate susceptibility to vancomycin (MICs of 8 mg/L). One E faecium had intermediate susceptibility to vancomycin (MIC 8 mg/L). High level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance occurred in 64 (15%) and 50 (12%) isolates respectively. CONCLUSION: Vancomycin resistance is rare and is essentially restricted to species that are rarely clinical pathogens, i.e., E casseliflavus and E gallinarum. Our results have established the local susceptibility profile for enterococcal isolates. This allows comparison with other locations and the detection of emerging trends of resistance.
TI  - Species identification of enterococci via intergenic ribosomal PCR.
AB  - Accurate species identification of enterococci has become important with the wide prevalence of acquired vancomycin resistance and the presence of less epidemiologically important, inherently vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Using a collection of enterococcal strains, we found that PCR amplification of the intergenic spacer (ITS-PCR) between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes can produce amplicon profiles characteristic of the enterococcus examined. The species examined were group I enterococci (Enterococcus avium, Enterococcus raffinosus, Enterococcus malodoratus, and Enterococcus pseudoavium), group II enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus casseliflavus, Enterococcus mundtii, and Enterococcus gallinarum), and group III enterococci (Enterococcus durans and Enterococcus hirae). The enterococcal species in group I, as well as E. faecalis and two strains of E. hirae, were similar and therefore had to be differentiated from each other by Sau3A restriction digests. This produced patterns characteristic of each of these species. The remaining group II and group III enterococcal species produced amplicons characteristic of a particular species except E. gallinarum. The PCR products from E. gallinarum displayed strain-to-strain heterogeneity in the number and size of amplicons. To further test the utility of this technique, 11 phenotypically aberrant strains which had been assigned species identification based on Facklam and Collins-type strain reactions (R.R. Facklam and M.D. Collins, J. Clin. Microbiol. 27:731-734, 1989) were subjected to ITS-PCR. ITS-PCR of the phenotypically aberrant strains identified six strains with reactions consistent with those of type strains. However, five strains were characterized as follows: two strains originally identified as E. mundtii were identified by ITS-PCR as E. casseliflavus, one strain originally identified as E. raffinosus was identified by ITS-PCR as E. durans, one strain originally identified as E. hirae was identified by ITS-PCR as E. faecium [corrected]. We conclude that amplification of the intergenic 23S and 16S rRNA gene regions of enterococci provides a reliable technique for species identification of enterococci.
TI  - Colonization by vancomycin-resistant enterococci of the intestinal tract of patients in intensive care units from French general hospitals.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of fecal carriage of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) by patients hospitalized in intensive care units from 24 French general hospitals. METHODS: Rectal swabs were obtained from 647 patients hospitalized in intensive care units during the month of June 1994 and plated on agar medium selective for vancomycin-resistant enterococci. The glycopeptide resistance phenotypes and genotypes of the enterococci detected were characterized. RESULTS: Thirty-two of 647 patients (4.9%) carried VRE. Thirteen strains (2%) were identified as Enterococcus faecium and 19 (2.9%) as Enterococcus gallinarum or Enterococcus casseliflavus. None of these strains was highly resistant to gentamicin. The E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus strains contained the vanC1 and vanC2 genes, respectively. The E. faecium strains were highly resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin and carried the vanA gene. No infection due to VRE was observed during the study period. Pulsed-field gel analysis of total DNA following digestion with SmaI or KspI from 13 VanA-type E. faecium strains revealed intra- and inter-hospital strain heterogeneity. However, the finding of isolates with indistinguishable pulsed-field types within the same ward and in two medical centers suggests patient-to-patient transmission or a common source. Four E. faecium strains were isolated within 48 h after admission of patients. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that VRE form part of the normal flora of patients and that, despite the actual scarcity of infections due to VRE, there is a potential risk for dissemination of these strains in French hospitals.
TI  - Evaluation of arbitrarily primed PCR analysis and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of large genomic DNA fragments for identification of enterococci important in human medicine.
AB  - The increasing problems encountered with enterococcal nosocomial infections and the intrinsic and acquired resistance of the enterococci to different antimicrobial compounds highlight the need for a rapid identification technique. Enterococcus faecalis is readily identified by biochemical tests, but species differentiation within the Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus gallinarum species groups is less well established. In the present study, 66 strains representing the most prevalent human enterococci were used to develop a PCR-based species-specific identification protocol. Whole-cell protein analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used as a reference method for species identification. In addition, the genomic SmaI macro-restriction fragment distribution of all of the strains was examined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Oligonucleotide D11344-primed PCR was as discriminative as whole-cell protein analysis and resulted in more easily interpreted band patterns. This PCR-based technique allowed identification of clinical isolates by visual examination of the DNA profiles obtained. The inability of both methods to discriminate between Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus flavescens brought into question the species status of E. flavescens. PFGE did not result in species-discriminative DNA bands or band patterns, but proved to be superior for interpretation of interstrain relationships.
TI  - A novel gentamicin resistance gene in Enterococcus.
AB  - Enterococcus gallinarum SF9117 is a veterinary isolate for which the MIC of gentamicin is 256 micrograms/ml. Time-kill studies with a combination of ampicillin plus gentamicin failed to show synergism against SF9117. A probe representing aac(6')-aph(2") did not hybridize to DNA from SF9117. A 3.2-kb fragment from plasmid pYN134 of SF9117 was cloned and conferred resistance to gentamicin in Escherichia coli DH5 alpha. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed the presence of a 918-bp open reading frame whose deduced amino acid sequence had a region with homology to the C-terminal domain of the bifunctional enzyme AAC(6')-APH(2"). The gene is designated aph(2")-Ic, and its observed phosphotransferase activity is provisionally designated APH(2")-Ic. An intragenic probe hybridized to the genomic DNA from an Enterococcus faecium isolate from the peritoneal fluid of one patient and to the plasmid DNA of an Enterococcus faecalis isolate from the blood of another patient. An enterococcal isolate containing this novel resistance gene might not be readily detected in clinical laboratories that use gentamicin at 500 or 2,000 micrograms/ml for screening for high-level resistance.
TI  - Multiplex PCR detection of vanA, vanB, vanC-1, and vanC-2/3 genes in enterococci.
AB  - Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are increasingly isolated from clinical specimens. One hundred clinical isolates of enterococci (E. casseliflavus/E. flavescens [n = 10], E. faecalis [n = 34], E. faecium [n = 43], E. avium [n = 1], E. gallinarum [n = 11], and E. raffinosus [n = 1]) were examined for the presence of vanA, vanB, vanC-1, and vanC-2/3 genes by a single multiplex PCR performed directly with colonies from blood agar plates. Six previously characterized VRE strains which carry either vanA, vanB, vanC-1, or vanC-2 genes were used as controls. To discriminate among van genes, the PCR amplicons were digested with MspI and were electrophoresed on agarose gels. Because of significant sequence homology between vanC-2 and vanC-3 genes, this assay is unable to discriminate these genes from each other; therefore, these are referred to as vanC-2/3 genes. PCR products were detected in 63 of the 100 clinical isolates. The restriction fragment length patterns were consistent with vanA for 10 strains, vanB for 30 strains, vanC-1 for 12 strains, vanC-2 for 6 strains, and vanA and vanC-1 for 1 strain. The vancomycin MICs for the isolates with restriction fragment length patterns consistent with vanA and vanB were all > and = 64 micrograms/ml. The vancomycin MICs for the isolates with restriction fragment length patterns consistent with vanC-1 or vanC-2 were 4 to 8 micrograms/ml. The vancomycin MICs for the isolates from which no PCR amplicons were produced were 2 to 4 micrograms/ml. A PCR product was produced in four isolates (vancomycin MICs, 4 to > 256 micrograms/ml) with restriction fragment length patterns differing from those for the control vanA, vanB, vanC-1, and vanC-2 isolates. DNA sequencing of these amplicons revealed that two of the four isolates had nucleic acid sequences which were closely related to the published sequence for the vanB gene and two had nucleic acid sequences which were closely related to the published sequence for the vanC-2 and vanC-3 genes. Multiplex PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism appears to be a useful and convenient method for rapidly detecting and discriminating genotypes for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. in the clinical laboratory. In instances in which unusual restriction fragment patterns of PCR amplicons occur, DNA sequencing can be performed to discriminate van genotypes.
TI  - Comparison of agar-based media for primary isolation of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare four vancomycin-containing agar media for the isolation of  glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE) from clinical fecal specimens: kanamycin---aesculin---azide (KAA) agar; bile---aesculin---polymixin (BAP) agar; aztreonam---amphotericin blood (CBAA) agar; and neomycin blood (CBN) agar. METHODS: Fecal specimens from 125 patients were inoculated onto each medium. Media were examined for enterococci after incubation for up to 48 h. Enterococci were identified to species level, and glycopeptide phenotypes were determined by measuring minimum inhibitory concentrations of vancomycin and teicoplanin. RESULTS: GRE were isolated from 44/125 samples. Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium isolates, expressing glycopeptide resistance of the VanA or VanB phenotypes, were recovered from 27/33 (82%) specimens on BAP medium, 26/33 (79%) on KAA medium, and 21/33 (64%) on CBN and CBAA media. Enterococcus gallinarum and Enterococcus casseliflavus isolates expressing low-level glycopeptide resistance (VanC phenotype) were recovered from 14/15 (93%) specimens on CBAA medium, 7/15 (47%) on KAA and CBN media, and 6/15 (40%) on BAP medium. CONCLUSIONS: The media tested in this study, with the exception of CBN medium, detected at least 75% of patients colonized by GRE. Further development of BAP, CBAA and KAA media is warranted to improve growth and selectivity.
TI  - Distribution and characterization of Enterococcus species in municipal sewages.
AB  - The occurrence, distribution and characterization of enterococci in municipal sewages from two geographically different regional sewage treatment plants in East Slovakia was studied. The total counts of enterococci in samples varied from 10(4) to 10(6) CFU/ml. The vast majority of the strains identified were Enterococcus faecium (50%), with E. gallinarum (25.5%) and E. casseliflavus (10.1%). The species which accounted for 14.4% of the cultures were not specified. Lactic acid production from twenty isolates ranged from 0.085 mol l-1 to 0.914 mol l-1. Urease activity ranged from 1.21 nkat ml-1 to 10.49 nkat ml-1. The strains were resistant to at least one (except for vancomycin) and at most to six antibiotics tested. The majority of isolates were biresistant. Although nine strains were without bacteriocin production, the other strains inhibited the growth of enterococcal as well as staphylococcal isolates. E. faecium AL 40 produced bacteriocin which inhibited the growth of all indicators reaching 12 mm zones of inhibition. E. faecium was the most prevalent species in all samples, but the source position of isolates as well as the sewage composition did not affect enterococcal distribution. The ability of isolates to produce bacteriocin indicates their possible use in biotechnological environmental processes.
TI  - Presence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in farm and pet animals.
AB  - Enterococcus faecium strains with vanA-mediated glycopeptide resistance were isolated by enrichment culture from the intestines and feces of several animal species, mainly horses and dogs (8% positive), chickens (7% positive), and pigs (6% positive). Other vanA-positive enterococcal strains were identified as E. durans in gallinaceous birds, E. faecalis in a horse, and E. gallinarum in a pheasant. Samples from pigeons, cage birds, and ruminants were negative. It was concluded that vancomycin resistance is widespread among isolates from farm and pet animals.
TI  - Acidification of methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside: a useful test to differentiate Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus gallinarum from Enterococcus faecium species group and from Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Enterococcus gallinarum and E. casseliflavus are difficult to differentiate from  other enterococci, particularly E.faecium. The former two species were found to produce acid from methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside in phenol red broth, while E.faecalis strains and strains of the E.faecium species group, including E.faecium, E.durans, E. hirae, and E.mundtii, failed to produce acid from this substrate.
TI  - Semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotics derived from LY264826 active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  - Certain derivatives of the glycopeptide antibiotic LY264826 with N-alkyl-linked substitutions on the epivancosamine sugar are active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci. Six compounds representing our most active series were evaluated for activity against antibiotic-resistant, gram-positive pathogens. For Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis resistant to both vancomycin and teicoplanin, the MICs of the six semisynthetic compounds for 90% of the strains tested were 1 to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 2,048 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 256 micrograms/ml for LY264826. For E. faecium and E. faecalis resistant to vancomycin but not teicoplanin, the MICs were 0.016 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 64 to 1,024 micrograms/ml for vancomycin. The compounds were highly active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and against E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus and showed some activity against isolates of highly vancomycin-resistant leuconostocs and pediococci. The MICs for 90% of the strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus tested were typically 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 microgram/ml for vancomycin. Against methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis MICs ranged from 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 to 4 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 4 to 16 micrograms/ml for teicoplanin. The spectrum of these new compounds included activity against teicoplanin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci. The compounds exhibited exceptional potency against pathogenic streptococci, with MICs of < or = 0.008 microgram/ml against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant isolates. In in vivo studies with a mouse infection model, the median effective doses against a challenge by S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, or S. pyogenes were typically 4 to 20 times lower than those of vancomycin. Overall, these new glycopeptides, such as LY307599 and LY333328, show promise for use as agents against resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.
TI  - The gene encoding for penicillin-binding protein 5 of Enterococcus faecalis is useful for development of a species-specific DNA probe.
AB  - Recently, in Escherichia coli was cloned a Sau3AI 3.4-kb fragment containing the  gene encoding for penicillin-binding protein 5 (PBP5) of Enterococcus faecalis. The structural gene for the PBP of E. faecalis and the flanking regions were entirely sequenced (C. Signoretto, M. Boaretti, and P. Canepari, FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 123:99-106, 1994). When the entire cloned E. faecalis DNA insert, labeled with digoxigenin, was used as a probe to detect a homology gene in enterococci, it was observed that only DNAs of all the E. faecalis strains reacted to the probe. The same results were obtained when a HindIII fragment of 0.35 kb from the entire insert of 3.4 kb was used. In this study we tested a total of 62 clinically isolated enterococcal strains, belonging to the species E. faecalis (36 strains), E. faecium (13), E. gallinarum (6), E. bovis (2) E. avium (3), E. hirae (1), and E. casseliflavus (1). The results indicate that both the entire segment and the HindIII fragment may be useful for preparing a species-specific probe for rapid identification of E. faecalis species.
TI  - Control of endemic glycopeptide-resistant enterococci.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the epidemiology of, and control measures for, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) in a renal unit. DESIGN: A 3-month, prospective, prevalence culture survey of patients on a 24-bed renal unit. SETTING: A 975-bed community teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Patients admitted to the renal unit over a 3-month period. Patients identified with VRE were each matched with four patients without VRE isolated over the study period. INTERVENTIONS/CONTROL MEASURES: Resistant-organism barrier precautions. To eradicate carriage of VRE, two patients with VRE stool colonization were treated with 5 days of oral doxycycline (100 mg twice per day) and rifampin (300 mg/day). RESULTS: Seven patients with VRE (8 isolates) were identified. Five isolates were Enterococcus faecium (vancomycin MIC = 16 to 256 micrograms/mL), two were Enterococcus faecalis (MICs = 16 and 124 micrograms/mL), and one was Enterococcus gallinarum (MIC = 8.0 micrograms/mL). Eradication of carriage with VRE was accomplished in two patients treated with doxycycline and rifampin. In the final 30 days of the culture survey and at 9 months, there were no further patients with VRE identified. CONCLUSIONS: Resistant-organism precautions and elimination of patient carriage may be useful measures for controlling the spread of low-prevalence endemic vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and high-level gentamicin resistance among  enterococci isolated in a Mexican tertiary care center.
AB  - AIM: To describe the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of enterococcal clinical isolates. SETTING: A 200-bed tertiary-care center in Mexico City. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective surveillance of enterococcal clinical isolates identified according to Facklam's method since 1990. Susceptibility tests were performed by a commercial micromethod, agar diffusion and microbroth dilution. We present data from 1990 to 1992. RESULTS: A total of 407 enterococci were recovered during the study period: 245 from inpatients and 162 from outpatients; 325 of the isolates were Enterococcus faecalis, 61 E. faecium, seven E. avium, four each for E. raffinosus and, E. hirae; two, E. pseudoavium; and one each E. gallinarum, E. durans; E. mundtii, and E. faecales var asacharolyticus. Resistance to ampicillin and imipenem among E. faecium was 59%. Among E. faecalis, 0.3% were resistant to ampicillin and 2% to imipenem; no beta-lactamase production was detected. All were susceptible to vancomycin. Overall, a 12% high-level gentamicin resistance (HLGR) was found without a difference between species; 25% of bloodstream clinical isolates were HLGR enterococci. More than half (63%) of the HLGR clinical isolates were susceptible to streptomycin; a-hemolysis in human blood agar as well as nitrofurantoin resistance were observed in all E. faecium isolates and in two E. avium. CONCLUSIONS: In our center, HLGR has a prevalence of 12%. Streptomycin may be a therapeutic alternative in 63% of the HLGR cases. The pattern of hemolysis in human blood agar plus the susceptibility to nitrofurantoin could be used as an initial screening to identify enterococci.
TI  - Augmented production of extracellular superoxide by blood isolates of Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - To assess the frequency of extracellular superoxide (O-2) production by enterococci, multiple species were surveyed in a whole organism assay for their ability to reduce ferricytochrome c in a superoxide dismutase-inhibitable fashion. For stool and clinical enterococcal isolates and 12 type strains, only Enterococcus faecalis (87/91 isolates and ATCC 19433), Enterococcus faecium (5/13 isolates), Enterococcus casseliflavus (ATCC 25778), and Enterococcus gallinarum (ATCC 35038) produced extracellular O-2. Among 106 strains comprising 13 species of enteric gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci, only Lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis produced extracellular O-2. Mean (+/-SE) rates of extracellular O-2 production in vitro by E . faecalis for isolates associated with bacteremia and endocarditis and for isolates from stool were 2.4+/-0.2, 1.9+/-0.2, 1.5+/-0.3 nmol of O-2 min(-1) 10(9) cfu(-1), respectively (P=.025, analysis of variance), suggesting an association between invasiveness and extracellular O-2 production.
TI  - Epidemiologic analysis of glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus strains in neutropenic patients receiving prolonged vancomycin administration.
AB  - Vancomycin-resistant enterococci have been isolated with increasing frequency since 1988. Thus far, most of these resistant enterococci have belonged to the Enterococcus faecium species, and epidemiological studies have shown a wide diversity among interhospital and intrahospital isolates. This report presents an epidemiologic investigation of 25 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus strains--24 Enterococcus faecium and one Enterococcus gallinarum--isolated from the stools or blood of adult patients receiving intravenous vancomycin prophylaxis during neutropenia and hospitalized in a single hematologic unit. Macrorestriction patterns of total DNA and of ribosomal DNA regions were used to analyze the strains. Strains produced different total DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns after SmaI digestion. Ribotyping was less discriminative than pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The results confirmed the genetic unrelatedness of the strains. Prolonged vancomycin administration, commonly used in hematologic units, could be involved in the selection of endogenous resistant enterococcal strains.
TI  - Vancomycin-resistant enterococci colonizing the intestinal tracts of hospitalized patients.
AB  - A point prevalence culture survey was carried out to investigate the prevalence of fecal carriage of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) among patients admitted to an 800-bed general hospital where no VRE had been isolated previously. Twenty-two of 636 patients (3.5%) were found to be VRE carriers. Eighteen strains were identified as Enterococcus faecium, three were identified as Enterococcus gallinarum, and one was identified as Enterococcus faecalis. The susceptibilities of the enterococci to ampicillin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin were determined by the disk diffusion and the agar dilution methods. High-level resistance (HLR) to gentamicin and streptomycin was determined by the agar screening method. Eighteen strains (82%) were highly resistant to vancomycin, and four strains (18%) were moderately resistant to vancomycin. Five strains were susceptible to teicoplanin (23%; MICs, < or = 8 micrograms/ml). Only one strain (4.5%, E. faecium) showed HLR to gentamicin, and six strains (27%) showed HLR to streptomycin (one E. faecalis and five E. faecium strains). All 18 E. faecium and 1 E. faecalis strain carried the vanA gene, and 3 E. gallinarum strains carried the vanC gene. An epidemiological investigation revealed several risk factors for VRE colonization: hospitalization and duration of stay in the hematology department and prior vancomycin treatment. The study demonstrates that the patient's gastrointestinal tract is a possible reservoir for VRE, even in hospitals where VRE infections have not yet been observed. Therefore, we conclude that infection control precautions and restriction of glycopeptide usage may be key issues in limiting the emergence and spread of nosocomial VRE infections.
TI  - Species identification and antibiotic susceptibility of enterococci isolated from clinical specimens of hospitalized patients.
AB  - Over a 4-month period, a total of 315 enterococci were isolated from various clinical specimens of hospitalized patients. By applying an array of biochemical tests, all strains were accurately identified to the species level, and their susceptibilities to clinically relevant antibiotics were determined by a standardized agar dilution technique. E. faecalis and E. faecium accounted for 87.3% and 9.2% of isolates, respectively. E. avium (1%), E. gallinarum (1%), E. durans (0.6%), E. hirae (0.6%), and E. casseliflavus (0.3%) isolates were also identified. Eleven strains of E. faecium and 1 E. hirae isolate were resistant to ampicillin, but none of the isolates produced beta-lactamase. Twenty-three E. faecium and 3 E. faecalis strains as well as 1 E. hirae isolate revealed imipenem resistance. A total of 25.4% enterococci (60 E. faecalis and 19 E. faecium isolates, 1 E. hirae strain) were erythromycin-resistant. Twelve strains (11 E. faecium and 1 E. avium) exhibited ciprofloxacin resistance. High-level resistance to streptomycin was found in 58 (21.1%) E. faecalis, 9 (31%) E. faecium, and both E. hirae strains, whereas high-level gentamicin resistance (HLGR) was exclusively seen in the species E. faecalis (11.6% of isolates belonging to this species). A simple agar screening test containing 500 micrograms of gentamicin per ml proved to be highly reliable for detection of HLGR. The structural gene coding for HLGR was specifically amplified by the polymerase chain reaction in all isolates showing this resistance trait. Moreover, the gene was specifically detected by a nonradioactively labelled oligonucleotide probe in colony blot hybridization assays, indicating the potential application of these molecular approaches as a diagnostic tool.
TI  - Characteristics of enterococci and staphylococci isolated from the crop and caecum of Japanese quails exposed to microgravity conditions.
AB  - Ten selected strains of enterococci and staphylococci were isolated from the crop and caecum of Japanese quails exposed to microgravity conditions. Isolates were allotted to the species Enterococcus gallinarum, Ent. avium, Ent. faecium, Staphylococcus gallinarum and Staph. aureus. Isolated strains were facultatively anaerobic, non-motile, Gram-positive cocci, occurring in pairs, short chains or irregular clusters. Isolates utilized most of the soluble sugars tested and produced bacteriocin-like substances. Enterococci and staphylococci were resistant to monensin (50 mg/l) and sensitive to tylosin and virginiamycin (10 mg/l).
TI  - Comparison of pigment production and motility tests with PCR for reliable identification of intrinsically vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  - Forty-eight clinical isolates identified as either Enterococcus faecium or Enterococcus faecalis with the MicroScan system (Dade International, MicroScan Inc., West Sacramento, Calif.) were further characterized by two supplementary biochemical tests (pigment production and motility). Twenty isolates (42%), all initially identified as E. faecium, were motile. Of these 20, 8 isolates (17%) produced yellow pigment and were identified as Enterococcus casseliflavus and the remaining 12 (25%) were nonpigmented and were identified as Enterococcus gallinarum. Identical identification results were obtained when PCR amplification of regions of the vanC gene was used as a technique for differentiating these organisms. The results of this study indicate that motility and pigment production tests together with commercial test systems are sufficient for reliable identifications of E. faecium, E. casseliflavus, and E. gallinarum.
TI  - Identification of Enterococcus species isolated from foods of animal origin.
AB  - Enterococci isolated from a large variety of fresh and prepared foods of animal origin during routine microbiologic control tests in a distribution firm, were identified to species level using API 20 STREP galleries supplemented with conventional tests, rapid ID32 STREP galleries and SDS-PAGE analysis. API 20 STREP tests correctly identified 77% of the strains, mainly Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis. A simple presumptive identification scheme based on pigmentation, tetrazolium reduction and acid production from mannitol and raffinose identified 90% of the strains. More complex procedures were necessary to identify the remaining strains. Nearly all strains isolated from hard cheeses and prepared cheese-meat combinations were identified as E. faecium while E. faecalis was the most frequent species in crustaceans. In meat and in prepared meat products E. faecium, E. faecalis and less frequently E. hirae/E. durans were found. Three of four E. gallinarum strains were isolated from products containing turkey meat.
TI  - Investigation of the reformulated Remel Synergy Quad plate for detection of high-level aminoglycoside and vancomycin resistance among enterococci.
AB  - We investigated the accuracy of the recently released Remel Synergy Quad plate, a commercially available agar screening method for detecting high-level aminoglycoside and vancomycin resistance among enterococci that is based on the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards recommended guidelines (National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, M7-A3, 1993). The Synergy Quad correctly determined the gentamicin and streptomycin resistance status for > or = 97% of 147 Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium isolates tested. Detection of vancomycin resistance also was reliable, as no false susceptibility occurred with 36 vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis and E. faecium strains and false resistance occurred only once with the 47 susceptible strains tested. One strain each of Enterococcus gallinarum and Enterococcus casseliflavus failed to grow on the screen, but because the true nature and significance of resistance in such isolates is unknown the implication of their screen negativity is uncertain. In summary, the Remel Synergy Quad provides a highly accurate and convenient method for susceptibility testing of enterococci against gentamicin, streptomycin, and vancomycin.
TI  - Characterisation and antimicrobial susceptibility of Enterococcus species from the intestines of ducks in Assam.
AB  - The Enterococcus flora of duck intestines consisted of E faecalis and E faecium in ducklings less than eight weeks old and E faecalis, E faecium and E gallinarum in ducks more than eight weeks old. The enterococci were resistant to several antibiotics; chloramphenicol and gentamycin sulphate were the only antibiotics of those tested which were moderately effective. All the Enterococcus species isolates were resistant to the macrolide and lincosamide antibiotics.
TI  - The effect of salinomycin and lasalocid on laboratory cultures of Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus gallinarum strains.
AB  - The growth of Enterococcus faecium strains CCM 4231 and EF 26, and Staphylococcus gallinarum SG 31 was inhibited by salinomycin and lasalocid at concentrations of 25 and 50 mg/L. Staphylococcus gallinarum was more sensitive to the additives used than were enterococci. Maximum inhibition (90%) was measured after the growth with the SG 31 strain in the presence of both ionophores. Growth of organisms was more inhibited by salinomycin at 25 mg/L (67.5%) than at 50 mg/L (63%). The inhibitory effect in enterococcal strains reached after the addition of salinomycin and lasalocid (on average) 63 and 58%, respectively. The CCM 4231 strain was more inhibited by salinomycin as well as by lasalocid than was the EF 26 strain.
TI  - High-level gentamicin resistance among enterococci.
AB  - The bi-functional enzyme 6'-aminoglycoside acetyltransferase (AAC-6')-2" aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (APH-2"), which is encoded by the 2 kb fused gene aacA-aphD, mediates gentamicin resistance in Enterococcus faecalis. This gene is associated with the composite transposon Tn5281 that shares extensive homology with transposons Tn4001 and Tn4031 found in staphylococci. Typically these transposons are characterized by the resistance gene being flanked by 1.35 kb insertion sequences (IS256). The resistance gene (aacA-aphD) appears identical among all E. faecalis studied, but restriction enzyme analysis indicates notable heterogeneity within the flanking regions. Various combinations of IS256-like and IS257-like elements, or portions thereof, have been described in different resistant isolates. As gentamicin resistance has been described in other enterococcal species (E. faecium, E. avium, E. gallinarum, E. raffinosus, E. casseliflavus) homology with the resistance gene of E. faecalis has largely been maintained, but more extensive variations in the flanking sequences have been noted. Although many similarities exist among enterococcal gentamicin resistance determinants, heterogeneity in the flanking regions indicates that measurable divergence exists among these determinants. This divergence may be of value in characterizing the mechanisms and natural course of gentamicin resistance dissemination which now includes staphylococci, enterococci and streptococci.
TI  - Occurrence of high-level aminoglycoside resistance in environmental isolates of enterococci.
AB  - High-level resistance to aminoglycosides was observed in environmental isolates of enterococci. Various aquatic habitats, including agricultural runoff, creeks, rivers, wastewater, and wells, were analyzed. Strains of Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, E. gallinarum, and other Enterococcus spp. demonstrated multiple antibiotic resistance patterns to aminoglycosides.
TI  - Detection of glycopeptide resistance genotypes and identification to the species  level of clinically relevant enterococci by PCR.
AB  - A PCR assay that allows simultaneous detection of glycopeptide resistance genotypes and identification to the species level of clinically relevant enterococci (Enterococcus faecium, E. faecalis, E. gallinarum, and E. casseliflavus) was developed. This assay was based on specific amplification of internal fragments of genes encoding D-alanine:D-alanine ligases and related glycopeptide resistance proteins. The specificity of the assay was tested on 5 well-characterized glycopeptide-resistant strains and on 15 susceptible enterococcal type strains. Clinical isolates of enterococci that could not be identified to the species level by conventional methods were identified by the PCR test. This assay offers a specific and rapid alternative to antibiotic susceptibility tests, in particular for detection of low-level vancomycin resistance.
TI  - DNA hybridization and contour-clamped homogeneous electric field electrophoresis  for identification of enterococci to the species level.
AB  - In this study, 113 Enterococcus faecium, 37 Enterococcus faecalis, 24 Enterococcus gallinarum, 15 Enterococcus raffinosus, and 13 Enterococcus casseliflavus clinical isolates and American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) strains were evaluated by contour-clamped homogeneous electric field electrophoresis. Thirty-one of the E. faecium, 22 of the E. faecalis, 24 of the E. gallinarum, 15 of the E. raffinosus, and 13 of the E. casseliflavus isolates were also evaluated by DNA-DNA hybridization. Genomic DNAs from type strains E. faecalis ATCC 19433, E. faecium ATCC 19434, E. gallinarum ATCC 49573, E. raffinosus ATCC 49427, and E. casseliflavus ATCC 25788 were labeled with biotin for use as probes. E. faecalis differed from all other species in always having a largest fragment of > 400 kb. E. gallinarum was different from all other species in having all SmaI fragments of < 200 kb. Biotin-labeled probes showed a high degree of hybridization with genomic DNA from the same species and a low degree of hybridization when hybridized to genomic DNA from different species for all isolates tested except for four isolates identified as E. faecium by conventional biochemical methods. The DNA from these four isolates hybridized strongly to DNA from E. gallinarum ATCC 49573 and weakly to E. faecium ATCC 19434 DNA and had all SmaI fragments of < 200 kb in size. These data suggest that these isolates are nonmotile E. gallinarum. DNA from each ATCC type strain hybridized strongly with itself and had only a low degree of hybridization with DNA from other ATCC type strains tested. These results suggest that contour-clamped homogeneous electric field electrophoresis patterns and DNA-DNA hybridization with biotin-labeled probes may be of use for species differentiation of some enterococci.
TI  - Characterization of enterococci isolated from human and nonhuman sources in Brazil.
AB  - A total of 330 enterococci strains isolated from several human (272 strains) and  animal (27) clinical specimens and environmental sources (31) in Brazil were identified to species level. Major human sources included urine (48.5%), blood (15.8%), and wounds (9.5%). Human isolates were identified as Enterococcus faecalis (90.0%), E. faecium (6.9%), E. gallinarum (1.1%), E. durans (0.8%), E. casseliflavus (0.4%), E. raffinosus (0.4%), and E. mundtii (0.4%). Strains isolated from animals were composed of E. hirae (40.7%), E. faecalis (33.3%), E. faecium (18.5%), and E. casseliflavus (7.5%). Among environmental isolates, 42.0% were E. faecalis, 35.4% E. faecium, 13.0% E. hirae, 6.4% E. casseliflavus, and 3.2% E. durans. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed for 200 strains. Overall, high-level resistance (HLR) to aminoglycosides was found in 66 (33.0%) of the strains tested. HLR to gentamicin was detected in 11.5% of the strains, whereas 19.0% of the strains showed HLR to streptomycin and 26.0% showed HLR to kanamycin. Five (22.7%) of the E. faecium strains were resistant to ampicillin [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) > 32 micrograms/ml]. Vancomycin MIC50 and MIC90 were 2 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively; only eight strains (identified as E. casseliflavus or E. gallinarum) had MIC of 8 micrograms/ml. No beta-lactamase activity was detected by the nitrocefin test.
TI  - Transferability and genetic relatedness of high-level gentamicin resistance among enterococci.
AB  - Gentamicin resistance in six enterococcal species was investigated. Transfer of resistance was observed for the donors E. faecium UC 79, E. avium CC 54, and E. gallinarum B 51, but not for E. raffinosus UC 78 or E. casseliflavus UC 73. Except for E. casseliflavus UC 73, homology was observed between the E. faecalis aac6'-aph2" gene and DNA from other species. Whereas 2.6-kb HindIII fragments encoded resistance in E. faecalis UC 244, its transconjugant, and E. raffinosus UC 78, 3.4-kb fragments encoded resistance in E. faecium UC 79, E. gallinarum B 51, and their transconjugants. A 3.4-kb fragment encoded resistance in E. avium CC 54, but 2.6-kb fragments encoded resistance in the transconjugants. Although many similarities were found among the strains, the heterogeneity in gentamicin resistance exhibited by some isolates indicates diversity among these determinants.
TI  - [Determination of the susceptibility of staphylococci and enterococci to plycopeptides by the E-test method].
AB  - E-test was evaluated by comparison with the reference agar dilution method on 15  enterococci and 15 staphylococci with variable resistance to glycopeptides and isolated from clinical samples: 15 enterococci with 3 glycopeptide-resistant (2 E. facalis and 1 E. faecium), 1 glycopeptide intermediate E. gallinarum and 11 glycopeptide-sensible E. faecalis; 15 staphylococci with 4 teicoplanine-resistant (1 S. aureus, 1 S. epidermidis and 2 S. hominis), 3 teicoplanin-intermediate (1 S. epidermidis, 2 S. haemolyticus) and 8 teicoplanin sensible strains (6 S. aureus, 1 S. epidermidis and 1 S. hominis). Repeatability (10 determinations by strain) and exactitude were tested for all strains. Our data shows very good results for repeatability and exactitude with the reference method except in the case of coagulase negative staphylococci and teicoplanin. Some technical problems appear in our experience: for staphylococci, a 48 h incubation is necessary to detect teicoplanin-intermediate strains but 24 h is sufficient for enterococci. E-test is expensive, require a strict methodology, but is a good method to detect glycopeptide resistance for staphylococci and enterococci except for coagulase negative staphylococci and teicoplanine.
TI  - Modification of peptidoglycan precursors is a common feature of the low-level vancomycin-resistant VANB-type Enterococcus D366 and of the naturally glycopeptide-resistant species Lactobacillus casei, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Enterococcus gallinarum.
AB  - The biochemical basis for the acquired or natural resistance of various gram-positive organisms to glycopeptides was studied by high-pressure liquid chromatographic analysis of their peptidoglycan UDP-MurNAc-peptide precursors. In all cases, resistance was correlated with partial or complete replacement of the C-terminal D-Ala-D-Ala-containing UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide by a new precursor with a modified C terminus. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis by sequential assignment showed that the new precursor encountered in Enterococcus faecium D366, a strain belonging to the VANB class, which expresses low-level resistance to vancomycin, was UDP-MurNAc-L-Ala-gamma-D-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-lactate, identical to that previously found in the VANA class, which expresses high-level resistance to vancomycin. High-pressure liquid chromatographic analyses, composition determinations, and digestion by R39 D,D-carboxypeptidase demonstrated the exclusive presence of the new precursor in Lactobacillus casei and Pediococcus pentosaceus, which are naturally highly resistant to glycopeptides. The low-level natural resistance of Enterococcus gallinarum to vancomycin was found to be associated with the synthesis of a new precursor identified as a UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide containing a C-terminal D-serine. The distinction between low and high levels of resistance to glycopeptides appeared also to depend on the presence or absence of a substantial residual pool of a D-Ala-D-Ala-containing UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide.
TI  - Characterization of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci from U.S. hospitals.
AB  - We examined 105 clinical isolates of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci collected from 31 U.S. hospitals in 14 states during May 1988 to July 1992. The isolates included 82 Enterococcus faecium, 8 E. faecalis, 6 Enterococcus spp., 5 E. gallinarum, 3 E. casseliflavus, and 1 E. raffinosus. The isolates were categorized into the following four phenotypes of glycopeptide resistance on the basis of their MIC patterns: (i) 70 VanA (vancomycin [Vm] MIC, > or = 64 micrograms/ml; teicoplanin [Tei] MIC, 16 to > or = 128 micrograms/ml), (ii) 26 VanB (Vm MIC, 16 to 1,024 micrograms/ml; Tei MIC, < or = 2 micrograms/ml), (iii) 5 VanC (Vm MIC, 4 to 16 micrograms/ml; Tei MIC, < or = 2 micrograms/ml) in E. gallinarum, and (iv) 3 E. casseliflavus and 1 E. raffinosus isolates for which Vm MICs were 4 to 16 micrograms/ml and Tei MICs were < or = 1 micrograms/ml were called unclassified. Of the 101 isolates with the VanA, VanB, and VanC phenotypes, 99 were confirmed by production of a specific 1,030-, 433-, or 796-bp polymerase chain reaction product, respectively, and hybridization with the respective gene probe. The vanA gene was also detected in the E. raffinosus isolate for which the Vm MIC was 16 micrograms/ml and the Tei MIC was 1 microgram/ml. The vanA gene was located on either a 34- or a 60-kb plasmid in all of the U.S. isolates examined. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis demonstrated both intrahospital and interhospital diversity among Vmr enterococci in the United States and was more useful than plasmid analysis for epidemiologic studies.
TI  - Identification and characterization of multiple species of vancomycin-resistant enterococci, including an evaluation of Vitek software version 7.1.
AB  - A total of 374 clinical isolates of Enterococcus spp. were characterized to determine the species distribution and vancomycin resistance. The ability of the Vitek system (bioMerieux Inc, Hazelwood, St. Louis, Mo.) to identify enterococci to the species level and to recognize vancomycin resistance by using computer software version 7.1 was evaluated. Conventional methods were used for identification and agar dilution was used for susceptibility testing, the results of which were as follows (presented as number of vancomycin-resistant isolates/number of members of that species identified): 219/234 E. faecium, 9/112 E. faecalis, 2/3 E. mundtii, 0/1 E. durans, 0/1 E. hirae, 0/1 E. raffinosis, and 0/1 E. avium. Ten enterococci were in the vancomycin-intermediate category (six E. gallinarum, two E. casseliflavus, and one each of E. faecium and E. faecalis). The Vitek GPI card correctly identified 98% of E. faecium isolates, 99% of E. faecalis isolates, and only two isolates of other enterococcal species. The GPS-TA card was 98% sensitive and 95% specific for the detection of vancomycin resistance, generating a total of four very major (1.6%) and five minor errors (1.3%).
TI  - Characteristics of Enterococcus strains isolated in 1991-1992.
AB  - The paper presents the identification and resistance to antibiotics as well as the high-level resistance of 96 strains of enterococci isolated in 1991-1992 from patients admitted in the "Victor Babes" Hospital of Infectious Diseases. The identification of Enterococcus species using the Facklam-Collins schedule and several additional tests reveal 86.4% E. faecalis, 7.2% E. faecium, 4.1% E. gallinarum and 1.0% E. durans and 1% E. hirae. The high-level resistance to aminoglycosides was 69.8% for Streptomycin, 50%--Kanamycin and 21.8%--Gentamicin. The phenotype of resistance to Streptomycin, Kanamycin and Gentamicin was found in 19.8% of strains. 7.4% of enterococci had MIC values higher or equal to 32 mcg/ml to Penicillin and MIC > or = to 16 mcg/ml to Ampicillin. Six E. faecalis strains and two E. gallinarum strains were resistant to Vancomycin.
TI  - In vitro activity of sparfloxacin and clinafloxacin against multidrug-resistant enterococci.
AB  - We evaluated the in vitro susceptibility of 140 clinical enterococcal isolates to the quinolones sparfloxacin and clinafloxacin. Isolates included Enterococcus faecalis (107), Enterococcus faecium (29), Enterococcus raffinosus (3), and one Enterococcus gallinarum. There were 111 isolates that showed high-level [minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) > or = 2000 micrograms/ml] resistance to gentamicin and were resistant to high levels of all other aminoglycosides; five isolates produced beta-lactamase; 21 isolates were resistant (MIC > or = 16 micrograms/ml) to ampicillin and were not beta-lactamase producers; and 13 strains were resistant (MIC > or = 32 micrograms/ml) to vancomycin. Most strains were susceptible to low concentrations of sparfloxacin and clinafloxacin, with MIC90S of 0.6 microgram/ml and 0.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. There were no inoculum effects. Time-kill experiments were performed with 22 strains; using 2 x MIC at 24 h, a > or = 2 log10 reduction in growth was observed with sparfloxacin and clinafloxacin for 14 and 17 strains, respectively. Time-kill synergism experiments were performed with 15 strains lacking high-level aminoglycoside resistance. In vitro bacterial synergism with the combination of sparfloxacin or clinafloxacin with streptomycin or gentamicin was observed for five and 12 isolates, respectively. The bactericidal activity of sparfloxacin and clinafloxacin suggest that these antibiotics may prove useful for therapy of multidrug resistant enterococci.
TI  - Presumptive fecal streptococci in environmental samples characterized by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  - The use of fecal streptococci as fecal indicators requires better knowledge of the ecology of these bacteria. We isolated 371 presumptive fecal streptococci from environmental samples--domestic wastewater, forest industry wastewater, contaminated surface and seawater, well water, cow dung, bird droppings, and pristine waters--and clustered them according to their protein profiles in one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. Some clusters could be tentatively identified with the help of reference strains. Samples from each environment had a typical composition of streptococcus types. Enterococcus faecalis was present, but not as a dominating enterococcal species, in samples in which fecal contamination was probable. Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus hirae, and Enterococcus mundtii had protein profiles that were difficult to distinguish from each other. These bacteria were found in a variety of samples. Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus gallinarum had identical protein profiles. On the basis of the maximum temperatures for growth and pigment production, isolates of this protein profile group common in forest industry wastewaters were identified as E. casseliflavus. Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis was also found in this environment. Nearly all strains from pristine waters belonged to protein profile groups which could not be identified with the aid of known Aerococcus, Enterococcus, Lactococcus, or Streptococcus strains. The maximum temperatures for growth and the results of fatty acid analysis were in general agreement within each protein profile group.
TI  - Ability of clinical laboratories to detect antimicrobial agent-resistant enterococci.
AB  - To test the ability of clinical laboratories to detect antimicrobial resistance among enterococci, we sent four vancomycin-resistant enterococcal strains and one beta-lactamase-producing enterococcus to all 93 nongovernment, hospital-based clinical laboratories in New Jersey; 76 (82%) participated in the study. Each organism was tested by the laboratory's routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing method. The proportion of laboratories that correctly reported that an isolate was resistant to vancomycin varied according to the resistance level of the isolate: high-level resistance (MIC for Enterococcus faecium = 512 micrograms/ml), 96% of laboratories correct; moderate-level resistance (MIC for E. faecium = 64 micrograms/ml), 27% correct; low-level resistance (MIC for Enterococcus faecalis = 32 micrograms/ml), 16% correct; and intrinsic low-level resistance (MIC for Enterococcus gallinarum = 8 micrograms/ml), 74% correct. The beta-lactamase-producing E. faecalis isolate was identified as resistant to penicillin and ampicillin by 66 and 8% of laboratories, respectively, but only three laboratories recognized that it was a beta-lactamase producer. This survey suggests that many laboratories may fail to detect antimicrobial agent-resistant enterococci.
TI  - The vanB gene confers various levels of self-transferable resistance to vancomycin in enterococci.
AB  - Thirty-nine strains of Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis resistant to vancomycin and susceptible to teicoplanin on disk susceptibility testing (phenotypic class B) were isolated in 15 hospitals in Europe and the United States. The MICs of vancomycin for these strains ranged from 4 to 1024 micrograms/mL. Part of the vancomycin resistance gene vanB from E. faecalis V583 hybridized with a single but variably sized HindIII-KpnI fragment of total DNA from all 39 strains. This indicates that a single class of resistance determinants accounts for the VanB phenotype. No hybridization was detected with DNA from intrinsically resistant Enterococcus gallinarum or Enterococcus casseliflavus. Hybridization with DNA from enterococcal strains susceptible to or with acquired resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin was not observed. The genes conferring resistance to vancomycin were self-transferable to other Enterococcus strains in 14 of the 39 strains. It thus appears that vanB confers various levels of conjugative vancomycin resistance in enterococci.
TI  - In vitro activity of RP59500, an injectable streptogramin antibiotic, against vancomycin-resistant gram-positive organisms.
AB  - The in vitro activity of RP59500, a streptogramin antibiotic, against 146 clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant gram-positive bacteria was examined. Five strains of the species Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus gallinarum, for which the MIC of vancomycin was 8 micrograms/ml, were also studied. Twenty-eight vancomycin-susceptible strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium were included for comparison. The drug was highly active against Leuconostoc spp., Lactobacillus spp., and Pediococcus spp. (MICs, < or = 2 micrograms/ml). RP59500 was more active against vancomycin-susceptible strains of E. faecium than E. faecalis (MICs for 90% of the strains [MIC90s], 1.0 versus 32 micrograms/ml). Vancomycin-resistant strains of E. faecalis were as resistant to RP59500 as vancomycin-susceptible strains (MIC90, 32 micrograms/ml), but some vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains were relatively more resistant to the new agent (MIC90, 16; MIC range, 0.5 to 32 micrograms/ml) than were vancomycin-susceptible organisms of this species.
TI  - Occurrence and mechanisms of glycopeptide resistance in gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Despite belief that the unique mechanism of glycopeptide action would preclude the development of resistance in susceptible organisms, clinical isolates of enterococci and staphylococci resistant to these compounds have been described. Among the enterococci, there are at least three types of resistance. Type A (high-level) resistance was described in Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis. It is inducible and mediated by elaboration and/or increased activity of at least three enzymes: a ligase, a dehydrogenase, and a carboxypeptidase, which orchestrate the production of peptidoglycan precursors that do not bind vancomycin. Type B (low-level) resistance described in E. faecium is also mediated by increased carboxypeptidase activity and, possibly, by elaboration of a protein detectable after incubation in vancomycin whose function is unknown. Type C resistance is associated with production of a ligase constitutively produced, chromosomally encoded, and unique to E. gallinarum. Among the staphylococci, coagulase-negative clinical isolates were obtained that were resistant to glycopeptides and one coagulase-positive isolate was resistant to teicoplanin but the mechanism of resistance is unknown. Additionally, coagulase-positive staphylococci resistant to glycopeptides have been prepared in the laboratory. They produce an approximately 39-kDa cytoplasmic protein, whose function is unknown, and have undergone extensive reorganization of their cell surface. The era in which universal gram-positive susceptibility to glycopeptides can be presumed is over; susceptibility testing must now accompany isolation of an enterococcus or staphylococcus of clinical importance.
TI  - [The effect of culture media on bacteriocin production in various strains of bacteria].
AB  - Some staphylococcus and enterococcus strains were used to investigate the effect  of culture medium on bacteriocin production. Staphylococcus cohnii SC7, Staphylococcus sp. ZTJ 151, S. saprophyticus SS 877, Enterococcus faecium EF1 and E. faecalis EFG2 were isolated from the rumen wall and contents of lambs, calves and fallow deer, Enterococcus gallinarum EG10 and E. avium EA12 were isolated from the caecum of Japanese quail. The tested bacteria belong to producers with a wide antimicrobial effectiveness spectrum, they have low to medium adherence and urease activity (Tab. III). These culture media were used to test the effect of culture medium on bacteriocin production: nutrient agar no. 2 and VL agar enriched with 2% of glucose and lactose (ZAG, ZAL, VLG, VLL), agar for isolation of faecal streptococci (SA) and the base for blood agar no. 4 and no. 2 (KA4, KA2). The strains Streptococcus bovis AO 24/85 and Staphylococcus aureus Oxford 209 P were used as indicator bacteria. Tables I and II show the results of these tests. The tested strains produced the widest inhibition zones (6 mm) with both indicators on SA medium, and this indicates massive bacteriocin production. On ZAG medium, the zones of enterococci with the AO 24/85 strain were larger size than those of staphylococci, but the zones were dim. All strains with the 209P indicator produced dim zones of the 2mm size. The larger inhibition zones (2-5mm) in comparison with staphylococci were observed in enterococci on the ZAL medium with the AO24/85 strain. The production of tested strains was balanced on VLG agar with respect to the use of both indicators.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - New vancomycin disk diffusion breakpoints for enterococci. The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards Working Group on Enterococci.
AB  - Since 1988, when the first vancomycin-resistant enterococcus was described, several descriptions of failures of disk diffusion breakpoints to detect low-level vancomycin resistance (MICs, 8 to 32 micrograms/ml) have been published. A four-laboratory collaborative study was undertaken to establish more accurate breakpoints for the disk test. Mueller-Hinton agar was used to perform dilution testing (in three laboratories) and disk diffusion testing (in all laboratories). Results were determined at 18, 24, and 48 h, and zones of inhibition were read using both transmitted and reflected light. One hundred organisms (35 Enterococcus faecalis, 55 E. faecium, and 10 E. gallinarum or E. casseliflavus isolates) were selected to represent vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant phenotypes. Interlaboratory agreement of agar dilution MICs was better at 24 h (91 to 94% within +/- 1 dilution) than at 18 h (76% within +/- 1 dilution). Therefore, 24-h agar dilution MIC results were used as the reference. For disk diffusion, it was critical to note the presence of a haze or colonies inside the zone when interpreting the test, since this correlated better with the results of the agar dilution test. The presence of a haze or inner colonies was best detected by reading the zones with transmitted light and incubating the plates for a full 24 h. When plotted against 24-h agar dilution MICs, breakpoints of </= 14 mm (resistant), 15 to 16 mm (intermediate), and >/= 17 mm (susceptible) resulted in 58 minor errors (14.5% of total values) and 5 very major errors (2.2% of resistant values or 1.3% of total values). No major errors were seen. Results of repeat testing using a common lot of Mueller-Hinton agar showed 52 minor errors (13.3%) and 4 major errors (4.2% of susceptible values of 1.0% pf total values) but no very major errors. It is recommended that any haze or colonies within the zone be taken into account when determining zones of inhibition and that an MIC test be performed for strains with intermediate zones if vancomycin is being considered for treatment.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of common and unusual species of enterococci causing infections in the United States. Enterococcal Study Group.
AB  - We collected 705 isolates of enterococci (1 per patient) from cultures of a variety of anatomic sites from patients at eight tertiary-care hospitals in six geographic regions of the United States. A total of 632 (90%) Enterococcus faecalis, 58 (8%) E. faecium, 5 E. gallinarum, 4 E. avium, 3 E. casseliflavus, 1 E. raffinosus, and 1 E. hirae isolate and 1 biochemical variant of E. faecalis were identified; 606 (86%) of these isolates were associated with clinical infections. The most common sites of isolation were the urinary tract (402 [57%]), nonsurgical wounds (94 [13%]), the bloodstream (74 [10%]), and surgical wounds (62 [9%]). High-level resistance to gentamicin or streptomycin or both was detected in 265 (38%) of the isolates. We identified two E. faecalis isolates resistant to vancomycin (MICs, 32 and 128 micrograms/ml) and 11 beta-lactamase-producing E. faecalis isolates. E. faecium isolates were significantly more resistant than E. faecalis isolates to penicillin, ampicillin, piperacillin, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin (P less than 0.001). The MICs for the 15 non-E. faecalis, non-E. faecium enterococci indicated variable resistance to ciprofloxacin and the penicillins. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns vary among species of enterococci, and these organisms, while commonly resistant to high-level aminoglycosides, can also acquire resistance to vancomycin or the ability to produce beta-lactamase. Because of these diverse antimicrobial resistance mechanisms, successful treatment and control of enterococcal infections with current antimicrobial agents are becoming increasingly difficult.
TI  - Emergence and nosocomial transmission of ampicillin-resistant enterococci.
AB  - Between 1986 and 1988, the incidence of ampicillin-resistant enterococci increased sevenfold at a university-affiliated hospital. Forty-three patients acquired nosocomial infections with ampicillin-resistant enterococci, most of which were also resistant to mezlocillin, piperacillin, and imipenem. An analysis of plasmid and chromosomal DNAs of isolates revealed that the increase was due to an epidemic of 19 nosocomial infections that yielded closely related strains of Enterococcus faecium and to a significant increase in the incidence of nonepidemic, largely unrelated strains of ampicillin-resistant enterococci. The nonepidemic strains were identified as E. faecium, E. raffinosus, E. durans, and E. gallinarum. A logistic regression analysis revealed that patients with nonepidemic resistant strains were 16 times more likely than controls to have received preceding therapy with imipenem. In our institution, the increase in the incidence of ampicillin-resistant enterococci appears to be due to the selection of various strains of resistant enterococci by the use of imipenem and to the nosocomial transmission of E. faecium and E. raffinosus.
TI  - Sequence of the vanC gene of Enterococcus gallinarum BM4174 encoding a D-alanine:D-alanine ligase-related protein necessary for vancomycin resistance.
AB  - The amplification product obtained with DNA from vancomycin-resistant (VmR) Enterococcus gallinarum BM4174 and a pair of degenerate oligodeoxyribonucleotides that correspond to conserved amino acid (aa) motifs in Escherichia coli D-alanine (D-Ala):D-Ala ligases and in En. faecium VmR protein (VanA) was used as a probe to clone the vanC gene of that strain. The vanC product, with a calculated Mr of 37,504, exhibits 29 to 38% aa identity with VanA and E. coli ligases. Insertional inactivation of vanC led to Vm sensitivity of BM4174 suggesting that the gene may encode a D-Ala:D-Ala ligase of altered specificity.
TI  - Detection of high-level aminoglycoside resistance in enterococci other than Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The ability of six screening methods to detect high-level aminoglycoside resistance in enterococcal species other than Enterococcus faecalis was investigated. The 85 Enterococcus isolates, which included 55 E. faecium, 11 E. gallinarum, 9 E. casseliflavus, 5 E. raffinosus, 4 E. avium, and 1 E. mundtii, were tested by using aminoglycoside-supplemented brain heart infusion agar (BHI), Remel EF Synergy Quad plates, high-content aminoglycoside diffusion disks, standard (prepared in-house) microdilution panels, Pasco MIC Gram Positive microdilution panels, and Vitek GPS-TA cards. When tested on BHI, 32 and 35 strains showed resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin, respectively. Resistance profiles obtained with Remel EF Synergy Quad plates were in complete agreement with those obtained on BHI. However, growth on Mueller-Hinton agar-based plates was not as heavy. Some isolates showed only weak growth and required 48 h for resistance to become evident, especially with swab inoculation of quadrants containing 2,000 micrograms of gentamicin per ml. Profiles obtained by use of the agar-based screens were used as the basis for evaluating the other methods. Disk diffusion showed complete agreement. No false resistance occurred by either microdilution method, but 48 h of incubation was needed for detection of some gentamicin-resistant isolates, and 14% of the streptomycin-resistant strains were not detected by standard microdilution. The Vitek GPS-TA card detected 81 and 100% of the gentamicin- and streptomycin-resistant isolates, respectively. In general, most methods used to detect high-level aminoglycoside resistance in E. faecalis appear to be reliable for the testing of the other enterococcal species. However, further investigations with a greater number of resistant E. raffinosus, E. avium, and E. mundtii isolates, when they are available, will be useful for establishing the full range of enterococci that can reliably be tested by the various methods.
TI  - Recovery of vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci from pediatric liver transplant recipients.
AB  - Between November 1988 and October 1989, 49 first-time pediatric liver transplant  recipients at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh were prospectively monitored for the presence of stool colonization and the development of disease caused by vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci (VRGPC). Quantitative stool culturing was done on a weekly basis, and cultures were planted onto a selective medium for VRGPC. Isolates for which the MIC was greater than or equal to 8 were considered resistant to vancomycin. Patients were monitored clinically for the development of infection, and their charts were systematically reviewed for the use of antibiotics. Eighty-six isolates were recovered from 36 of the 49 patients. Enterococcal species were isolated from 31 patients and included Enterococcus gallinarum (n = 28), E. casseliflavus (n = 14), E. faecium (n = 9), E. faecalis (n = 2), E. mundtii (n = 2), and E. durans (n = 1). Stool colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci was noted to increase steadily during the first month after transplantation. Only 9 of 31 patients demonstrated clearance of these organisms in serial repeat cultures. Additional isolates of VRGPC included Lactobacillus confusus (n = 13), Lactobacillus spp. (n = 12), and Pediococcus pentosaceus (n = 4). Infection due to VRGPC developed in three patients: a urinary tract infection in two and peritonitis in one. E. faecium was the pathogen in each of these cases. The ranges of MICs of vancomycin were 8 to 32 micrograms/ml for all enterococcal isolates and greater than 128 micrograms/ml for Lactobacillus and Pediococcus isolates. All Lactobacillus and Pediococcus isolates were resistant to teicoplanin, although they were susceptible to daptomycin. All other isolates were susceptible to both teicoplanin and daptomycin. This study demonstrates that stool colonization with VRGPC may be a common and early finding among pediatric liver transplant recipients. However, infection appears to be uncommon.
TI  - Composition of the enterococcal and streptococcal intestinal flora of poultry.
AB  - Identification to species level showed that Enterococcus faecalis and Ent. faecium largely dominated the enterococcal and streptococcal gut flora of 1-d-old chicks. Enterococcus faecalis was rare in 3- to 5-week-old broilers. Two species, Ent. faecium and Streptococcus alactolyticus, were isolated from nearly all broilers examined. Enterococcus hirae and Ent. durans were found in the small intestines of this category of poultry. In layers and parent stock of over 12 weeks of age, Ent. cecorum dominated with Strep. alactolyticus ranking next. Other species were isolated irregularly. Enterococcus avium and Ent. gallinarum, originally described from chickens, were rarely found. These species did not appear to belong to the normal intestinal flora of poultry.
TI  - Synergistic killing of vancomycin-resistant enterococci of classes A, B, and C by combinations of vancomycin, penicillin, and gentamicin.
AB  - Using both high and low inocula for time-kill curves, we examined the antibiotic  killing of clinical isolates of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (Enterococcus faecium, E. faecalis, and E. gallinarum) belonging to phenotypic resistance classes A, B, and C. None were resistant to high levels (greater than 500 mg/liter) of gentamicin. Vancomycin-penicillin-gentamicin resulted in 2 or more logs of killing above that of the most effective two-antibiotic combination for all strains except two of three E. gallinarum (VanC) strains and a constitutive mutant of a VanB strain. This strategy may be useful clinically.
TI  - Intrageneric relationships of Enterococci as determined by reverse transcriptase  sequencing of small-subunit rRNA.
AB  - The 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequences of eleven Enterococcus species were determined by reverse transcription in an attempt to clarify their intrageneric relationships. Comparative analysis of the sequence data revealed the presence of several species groups within the genus. The species E. avium, E. malodoratus, E. pseudoavium and E. raffinosus formed a distinct group as did E. durans, E. faecium, E. hirae and E. mundtii and the pair of species E. casseliflavus and E. gallinarum. Of the remaining species, E. cecorum, E. columbae, E. faecalis and E. saccharolyticus formed distinct lines of descent within the genus, whereas E. solitarius displayed a closer affinity with Tetragenococcus halophilus than with other enterococcal species.
TI  - In vitro detection of enterococcal vancomycin resistance.
AB  - By using agar dilution as the standard method, we determined the ability of broth microdilution, disk diffusion, and an automated system (AMS Vitek) to detect three different levels of vancomycin resistance among six enterococcal isolates. Enterococcus gallinarum AIB-38 and AIB-39 exhibited low-level resistance (MIC, 16 to 32 micrograms/ml) that was detected only by agar and broth dilution methods. E. faecalis V583, E. faecium AIB-42, and E. faecalis AIB-41 showed moderately high-level resistance (MIC, 128 to 256 micrograms/ml) that was detected by dilution methods but not by disk diffusion unless prolonged incubation or an inoculum 10-fold greater than the standard was used. Similarly, this level of resistance was detected by AMS Vitek only when an inoculum 10-fold larger than recommended was used. The high resistance demonstrated by E. faecium AIB-40 (MIC, 2,048 micrograms/ml) was readily detected by all methods studied. Variation in the ability of different methods to detect vancomycin resistance among enterococci complicates monitoring the incidence of these organisms and could result in very major susceptibility reporting errors.
TI  - Species identities of enterococci isolated from clinical specimens.
AB  - Conventional tests and commercially available systems were used to determine the  species identities of clinical isolates of enterococci. Strict adherence to the conventional test scheme of Facklam and Collins (R. R. Facklam and M. D. Collins, J. Clin. Microbiol. 27:731-734, 1989) resulted in the misidentification of lactose-negative Enterococcus faecalis isolates as Enterococcus solitarius, but this problem was overcome by the application of additional tests. The commercially available systems tested were unable to recognize some of the more recently described enterococcal species. E. faecalis accounted for 87.1% of 302 consecutive isolates. Enterococcus faecium (8.6%), Enterococcus avium (0.7%), Enterococcus durans (0.3%), Enterococcus gallinarum (1.0%), Enterococcus casseliflavus (1.0%), Enterococcus hirae (0.3%), and Enterococcus raffinosus (0.3%) isolates were also identified. None of the isolates produced beta-lactamase, but 15.4% of 235 isolates tested, including 1 strain of E. gallinarum, displayed high-level resistance to gentamicin.
TI  - Enterococci highly resistant to penicillin and ampicillin: an emerging clinical problem?
AB  - Sixteen clinical isolates of ampicillin-resistant enterococci (ARE) were recovered from the microbiology laboratory of a 450-bed rehabilitation medical center from January 1981 to September 1987. These isolates were detected when a disk diffusion test using 10 micrograms of ampicillin on a blood agar plate revealed no zones of inhibition. Tube macrodilution tests yielded an MIC of greater than or equal to 16 micrograms of ampicillin per ml. None of the isolates were penicillinase producers by the chromogenic cephalosporin disk test. Ten isolates were Enterococcus faecium, four isolates were E. raffinosus, one isolate was E. gallinarum, and one isolate was not identified (lost). There were 6 male and 10 female patients. The sources of isolates were urine (n = 7), wound (n = 5), ascitic fluid (n = 2), blood (n = 2), peritoneal catheter tip (n = 1), Bartholin's cyst abscess (n = 1), rectal swab (n = 2), and pancreatic abscess (n = 1). The organism was isolated from multiple sites in 4 patients, was a pure culture isolate in 5 patients, and was part of a polymicrobial flora in 11 patients. Six patients were diabetic, and four had liver cirrhosis. All but four patients had received at least one antibiotic within 3 weeks of ARE isolation. The MICs (micrograms per milliliter) for 50 and 90% of isolates tested, respectively, were as follows: ampicillin, 64 and 64; penicillin, 128 and greater than 128; vancomycin, 1 and 2; gentamicin, 4 and 16; ciprofloxacin, 1.6 and 3.2; imipenem, 128 and greater than 128; and daptomycin (LY146032), 1.6 and 6.4. ARE may be an emerging pathogen in the hospitalized patient population.
TI  - The effect of growth-promoting antibiotics on the faecal enterococci of healthy young chickens.
AB  - Small groups of chickens were given feed containing either avoparcin, nitrovin, virginiamycin or zinc bacitracin from the day of their purchase as day-olds. Differences between the birds receiving growth promoters and the untreated controls were observed during the last third of the 23 d survey period. The enterococcal population of the 'dosed' birds contained a greater proportion of Enterococcus faecium than did that of the control birds while the converse was true for Ent. gallinarum. This apparent selection of Ent. faecium by the growth-promoting antibiotics had an influence on the incidence of resistance to therapeutic antibiotics among the enterococcal population as a whole. This was because this species was generally more resistant than Ent. gallinarum to cephalothin, the MLS antibiotics (erythromycin, lincomycin and tylosin) and tetracycline.
TI  - The effect of ampicillin and tylosin on the faecal enterococci of healthy young chickens.
AB  - Enterococcal isolates from young chickens were differentiated into one of three species, namely Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium and Ent. gallinarum. The proportion of each species among the enterococcal population changed with time in birds not dosed with antibiotics. This pattern of change was modified in birds dosed with either tylosin or ampicillin even though ampicillin did not select for ampicillin resistance among the enterococcal population. A gradual increase in tylosin resistance was recorded with time among the enterococci of the 'undosed' control birds. This was associated with an increase in the proportion of Ent. faecium, a species commonly resistant to tylosin, among the enterococci of the birds as they grew older.
TI  - Use of penicillin-binding proteins for the identification of enterococci.
AB  - The results of 20 physiological and fermentation tests and examination of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of 85 enterococcal strains demonstrated that the genus Enterococcus could be divided into at least nine distinct species: E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. durans, E. hirae, E. avium, E. gallinarum, E. casseliflavus, E. malodoratus and E. mundtii. Each species had a specific pattern of at least five PBPs, with molecular masses in the range of about 40-130 kDa. The pattern of PBPs may be useful for identification purposes, since some strains with unusual fermentation characteristics were assigned to species by this technique.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Streptococcus.
AB  - A numerical taxonomic study of strains of Streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. The major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (S. faecalis, S. faecium, 'S. avium' and a proposed new species 'S. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (S. bovis, S. equinus, S. salivarius, 'S. casseliflavus', S. mutans, S. raffinolactis and an unidentified Oral Group I); (c) lactic species group (S. lactis including S. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (S. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (S. mitis, S. sanguis, a proposed new species 'S. oralis' and 'S. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. equi, 'S. equisimilis' including 'S. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of Lancefield Group B strains of human origin); (g) parapyogenic species group (S. uberis, 'S. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of Lancefield Groups R, S and T). Species of Aerococcus, Gemella, Leuconostoc and Pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
