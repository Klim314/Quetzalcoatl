TI  - Bacterial colonization in suspected sexually abused children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous studies concluded that symptomatic prepubertal children with  Gardnerella vaginalis infection should be investigated for child sexual abuse. Gardnerella vaginalis is only one out of a group of organism that cause bacterial vaginosis. The aim of the study was to report the frequency of bacterial colonization as well as sexually transmitted diseases and to correlate these data with patient characteristics. METHODS: Data were collected from 1996 to 2006. Medical records of 180 girls, median age at first sexual abuse 7.44 years (range 1-16, SD 3.937), have been evaluated retrospectively. SPSS software 12.0 has been used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Only 18.3% of patients complained of vaginal discharge or pruritus. Sexually transmitted diseases were documented: Gonorrhoea 1 (1.8%, 56 tested), Chlamydia trachomatis 1 (1.6%, 62 tested), Syphilis 0 (0%, 5 tested), Trichomonas vaginalis 1 (0.7%, 136 tested) and HIV 0 (0%, 27 tested). Bacterial colonization were documented (121 tested): Gardnerella vaginalis 29 (24%), Enterobacteriaceae 50 (41.3%), Haemophilus influenzae 11 (9.1%), Streptococcus a haemolyticus 35 (28.9%), Streptococcus Group B 8 (6.6%), Staphylococcus Koag neg. 37 (30.6%), Staphylococcus aureus 10 (8.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 4 (4.1%), Bacteroides 19 (15.7%), Prevotella 24 (19.8%), Klebsiella 4 (3.3%), Corynebacteria 20 (16.5%) and Ureaplasma 9 (7.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Sexually transmitted diseases are infrequent in children suspected for child sexual abuse. Bacterial colonization is common, however, not correlated with clinical symptoms (except for Bacteroides) and hymenal/vaginal injuries.
TI  - Vaginal microbiota in healthy pregnant women and prenatal screening of group B streptococci (GBS).
AB  - The microbiota of the lower female genital tract was evaluated from vaginal swabs obtained from 623 healthy pregnant women at gestation periods of 35-40 weeks. Isolated and identified microorganisms were expressed as percentages of total samples. As expected, lactobacilli made up the dominant vaginal microbiota (70%). Enterobacteriaceae, mainly Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus, were present in 38% of the samples, which might reflect the possible contamination of vaginal tract with rectal microorganisms. Candida albicans was present in 10% of healthy pregnant woman assayed. Streptoccocci (Streptococcus sp. and Enterococcus faecalis with 3% and 4%, respectively) and other gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus sp., 5%), along with other microorgansisms such as Gardnerella vaginalis (5%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2%) may represent a potential infection risk. Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococci beta-hemolytic, GBS) was detected in 7% of the samples. GBS infection is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality in the developed world. Furthermore, GBS was often co-isolated with C. albicans (54.5%) in the samples. A complete and detailed evaluation of the vaginal biota swab, with particular attention to the presence of potential pathogens such as GBS, is a preventive strategy that can provide useful information to obstetricians and gynecologist in managing the last days of pregnancy and delivery.
TI  - [The antagonistic activity of bifidobacteria in vitro and in vivo studied by using gnotobiological technology].
AB  - The antagonistic activity of 4 strains of bifidobacteria (B. adolescentis 2 F1, B. longum Z4, B. breve R2 and B. bifidum G1), isolated from the vagina of healthy females of the reproductive age, with respect to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella ozaenae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gardnerella vaginalis were studied in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro experiments revealed that all above-mentioned bifidobacteria were capable of inhibiting the growth of all indicator bacterial strains. Still of all the bifidobacteria under study had different levels of activity. B. adolescentis strain 2 F1 exhibited the highest inhibiting activity in vitro. In contrast to in vitro experiments, in vivo experiments with B. breve R2 demonstrated its high antagonistic activity with respect to E. coli. The data thus obtained indicate that in the study of antagonistic activity the use of the in vivo model as also expedient, for it is mainly in vivo that probiotic preparations show their activity.
TI  - In vitro activities of pazufloxacin, a novel injectable quinolone, against bacteria causing infections in obstetric and gynecological patients.
AB  - T-3762 is an injectable new quinolone with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. Pazufloxacin (T-3761) is an active form of T-3762. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of pazufloxacin for 50% of the clinical isolates tested were 3.13 microg/ml for Streptococcus agalactiae, 6.25 microg/ml for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.025 microg/ml for Escherichia coli, 0.78 microg/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 6.25 microg/ml for Peptostreptococcus magnus, 6.25 microg/ml for Bacteroides fragilis and 12.5 microg/ml for Prevotella bivia. The MICs of T-3762 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 3.13 microg/ml for S. agalactiae, 6.25 microg/ml for G. vaginalis, 0.10 microg/ml for E. coli, 12.5 microg/ml for P. aeruginosa, 25 microg/ml for P. magnus, 12.5 microg/ml for B. fragilis and 25 microg/ml for P. bivia. The results of this study suggest that, subject to confirmation by clinical trials, T-3762, in combination with an agent with reliable activity against anaerobic bacteria, is suitable as an empirical therapy of patients with obstetric and gynecological infections.
TI  - [In vitro inhibition of the growth of Gardnerella vaginalis by bacteriocins produced by strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa with inhibitory capacity in vitro was studied  on Gardnerella vaginalis strains. METHODS: Antimicrobial activity was demonstrated by inhibitory halos of bacterial growth on solid media by two methods: crossed streak and agar well diffusion. The inhibitory activity of this substance produced by P. aeruginosa was characterized as bacteriocin by: activity spectrum sensitivity proteolytic enzyme, chloroform, heat, pH, ultraviolet, irradiation effect and molecular weight. RESULTS: Four strains of P. aeruginosa producers of bacteriocins were chosen for this study and contacted with 40 strains of G. vaginalis. The producing strain D inhibited 70% of these G. vaginalis strains. The strains B and C inhibited 55% and 52.5%, respectively. The 3 strains presented a wide rank of action but the strain A had effect on a few strains of G. vaginalis. CONCLUSIONS: This work showed the inhibitory in vitro effect of bacteriocins of P. aeruginosa on strains of G. vaginalis. The results obtained suggest the probable topic application of bacteriocins as an alternative of conventional therapeutic on this infection biological control.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activities of the new quinolone, Bay y 3118, and ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, CI-960 and CI-990.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of the new quinolone, Bay y 3118, was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, CI-960 and CI-990 against 1640 isolates belonging to 117 bacterial species. Against members of the Enterobacteriaceae, Bay y 3118 was as active as CI-960 and CI-990, up to four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and tosufloxacin and up to 16-fold more active than sparfloxacin. The majority of Enterobacteriaceae which were resistant to ciprofloxacin (MICs > or = 2 mg/L) were sensitive to Bay y 3118. With the exception of ciprofloxacin which was less active, the activities of Bay y 3118 and the other comparator compounds were similar against Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter genospecies 3 and Acinetobacter strain 84. Bay y 3118 inhibited Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates at concentrations comparable with those of ciprofloxacin. However, non-aeruginosa Pseudomonas spp. were four times more susceptible to Bay y 3118 than to ciprofloxacin. All of the agents tested were equally active against Haemophilus, Moraxella, Neisseria and Bordetella spp. Against staphylococci, Bay y 3118 was the most active compound, followed jointly by CI-990, sparfloxacin, CI-960 and tosufloxacin, and then ciprofloxacin. Bay y 3118 remained highly active against Staphylococcus aureus strains resistant to ciprofloxacin; the MIC90 (0.5 mg/L) was 16-fold less than that of CI-990 and sparfloxacin, 32-fold less than that of CI-960 and 128-fold less than that of tosufloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Against haemolytic and non-haemolytic streptococci and Enterococcus faecalis, Bay y 3118 was two- to 16-fold more active than the other compounds. It had only moderate activity against Listeria spp., but this was superior to that of all the other compounds tested. Bay y 3118 was also the most active agent overall against anaerobic bacteria, although CI-960 and CI-990 had slightly better activity against Gardnerella vaginalis. It inhibited Mycobacterium spp. other than Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium scrofulaceum, Mycobacterium gordonae, Mycobacterium xenopi, Mycobacterium flavescens, Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium fortuitum) at concentrations < or = 0.06-4 mg/L and was between two- and 128-fold more active than the other compounds against these isolates; the two strains each of Mycobacterium terrae and Mycobacterium nonchromogenicum were resistant to Bay y 3118. In this study, Bay y 3118 was shown to be the most active and most broad-spectrum of the new quinolone and naphthyridine derivatives.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cefpirome and cefepime, two new cephalosporins.
AB  - In in vitro tests the broad-spectrum cephalosporins cefpirome and cefepime were highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, although often less so against strains resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate and ticarcillin-clavulanate, and against most strains of Acinetobacter spp. and Aeromonas hydrophila. They were also active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, although strains with non-plasmid mediated beta-lactam resistance were sometimes less sensitive. Other Pseudomonas spp. varied in their sensitivity. Both agents were highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, but beta-lactamase-producing Branhamella catarrhalis were somewhat less sensitive. Neisseria gonorrhoeae were susceptible, although non-beta-lactamase producing penicillin-resistant strains had higher MICs. Gardnerella vaginalis was also susceptible and Campylobacter coli/jejuni usually susceptible. Both antibiotics had good activity against Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci except for methicillin-resistant strains and Staphylococcus haemolyticus which were of borderline sensitivity. All streptococci were sensitive, with the exception of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci and enterococci against which cefpirome had greater activity than cefepime. Both antibiotics had little useful activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group or Bacteroides oralis group but were active against most other anaerobes. Clostridium difficile and some other Clostridium species were resistant.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of PD127,391, a new quinolone.
AB  - MICs of PD127,391 a new 4-quinolone, and of CI934 and ciprofloxacin, two previously reported 4-quinolones, were determined for common clinical bacterial isolates by an agar-dilution method. PD127,391 was the most active drug against Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter spp (MICs less than 0.12 mg/l) and as active as ciprofloxacin against Aeromonas spp. (MICs less than 0.008 mg/l) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MICs less than 1 mg/l). It was more active than ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas spp. including Ps. maltophilia (MICs less than 0.25 mg/l). All three drugs had high activity, with PD129,391 again the best, against Haemophilus influenzae Brahmamella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. PD127,391 was much more active than the other drugs against Campylobacter coli/jejuni (PD127,391 MICs less than 0.03 mg/l) and Gardnerella vaginalis (PD127,391 MICs less than 0.25 mg/l). PD127,391 inhibited all staphylococci at less than 0.06 mg/l and streptococci at less than 0.5 mg/l, thus being more active than CI934 or ciprofloxacin. PD127,391 was much more active against anaerobic cocci, Bacteroides spp. and clostridia (including Clostridium difficile) (MICs less than 1 mg/l) than was CI934 (MICs less than 16 mg/l) or ciprofloxacin (MICs less than 64 mg/l). No bacterium that we examined required more than 1 mg/l of PD127,391 for inhibition, and there was no cross resistance with unrelated antibiotics.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the two new oral cephalosporin metabolites RO 19-5247 and RO 15-8074.
AB  - A total of 629 clinical strains of gram positive and gram negative bacteria were  tested for their susceptibility to RO 19-5247, RO 15-8074, and other antimicrobial agents. Both RO 19-5247 and RO 15-8074 had good activity against strains of Enterobacteriaceae; however, resistance was found among some strains of Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Klebsiella and Morganella spp. Both compounds showed moderate to poor active against Acinetobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococci and Streptococcus faecalis. Against strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococci (not enterococci), each compound was highly active in vitro. RO 19-5247 and RO 15-8074 had comparable activity to cotrimoxazole, ceftazidime and ceftizoxime. Each new compound had considerably better activity then did cefaclor and amoxicillin/potassium clavulanate.
TI  - Controlled evaluation of trypticase soy broth with and without gelatin and yeast  extract in the detection of bacteremia and fungemia.
AB  - The addition of gelatin to blood culture media has been suggested to prevent the  inhibition of Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius that is caused by sodium polyanetholsulfonate. To determine the effect of such supplementation on the overall yield of microorganisms, we compared the yield and speed of detection of clinically important microorganisms from 5422 paired 10-ml samples of blood cultured in Trypticase soy broth (TSB) containing 0.03% sodium polyanetholesulfonate (SPS) and TSB/SPS containing 1.2% gelatin and 1.0% yeast extract (mTSB). The atmosphere of incubation (open venting unit) and ratio of blood to broth (1:5) were the same for both samples. Only cultures with adequate blood sample (greater than or equal to 80% of stated volume) were compared statistically. Addition of gelatin and yeast extract resulted in inhibited growth of Enterobacteriaceae (p less than 0.001), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (p less than 0.01), fungi (p less than 0.05), and the overall set of microorganisms encountered (p less than 0.001). It delayed growth of Enterobacteriaceae (p less than 0.001) but reduced the time to recover staphylococci (p less than 0.02). Of 12 isolates of species usually inhibited by SPS, seven grew only with the addition of gelatin and yeast extract, none grew only without supplementation, and five grew in both media. Although gelatin and yeast extract may improve the yield of some specific bacteria, the routine use of these additives cannot be recommended for all blood culture media.
TI  - The comparative in-vitro activity of eight newer quinolones and nalidixic acid.
AB  - The in-vitro antibacterial activity of nalidixic acid and the 4-quinolones, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, enoxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, A-56619, A-56620 and CI-934 was assessed by determination of MICs. The 4-quinolones were all highly active against most isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, including nalidixic acid-resistant strains. Ciprofloxacin (MICs 0.002-2 mg/l) was the most active and A-56619 (MICs 0.008-32 mg/l) was the least active. A-56619, A-56620, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and CI-934 were highly active against Acinetobacter strains, pefloxacin and enoxacin were slightly less active, and a few strains were resistant to norfloxacin. All the compounds, including nalidixic acid, were active against Aeromonas strains (MICs 0.001-0.12 mg/l). Ciprofloxacin (MICs 0.06-1 mg/l) was the most active compound against Pseudomonas aeruginosa; A-56619 and CI-934 (MICs 1-16 mg/l) were the least active against this species. All the compounds were highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae but the activity of all the compounds was poor against most isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis. All the 4-quinolones were active against staphylococci and CI-934 (MICs 0.03-0.25 mg/l) was the most active. CI-934 (MICs 0.06-2 mg/l) was also the most active compound against all streptococci. Most streptococci were sensitive also to ciprofloxacin (MICs 0.25-4 mg/l) but there were many isolates resistant to the other 4-quinolones. Against the anaerobic bacteria CI-934 was again the most active compound, particularly against the Gram-positive anaerobic cocci. Pefloxacin, enoxacin and norfloxacin had poor activity against most anaerobes. Ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, A-56619 and A-56620 had good to moderate activity against all species of anaerobes except the Bacteroides fragilis group, against which none of the compounds was very active.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of CI-934 compared with that of other new 4-quinolones and  nalidixic acid.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of CI-934, a new 4-quinolone compound, was compared with that of the other new 4-quinolones, enoxacin and ciprofloxacin, and also with that of nalidixic acid. CI-934 was more active than any of the other 4-quinolones tested against Gram-positive aerobic organisms including Staphylococcus aureus (MICs 0.06-0.25 mg/l), beta-haemolytic streptococci (MICs 0.12-0.5 mg/l), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MICs 0.25-0.5 ml/l), viridans streptococci (MICs 0.06-0.5 mg/l) and most enterococci (MICs 0.12-0.5 mg/l), although some ampicillin-resistant isolates of Str. faecium were slightly less susceptible (MICs 2 mg/l). All three of the newer 4-quinolones tested were highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, Aeromonas sp., Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MICs mostly less than 1 mg/l). The other Gram-negative aerobes tested were in general somewhat less susceptible, although for Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas aeruginosa MICs seldom exceeded 8 mg/l. CI-934 was more active than enoxacin against Gardnerella vaginalis (MICs 1-8 mg/l) although it was a little less active than ciprofloxacin. Bacteroides species (including about half of the fragilis group) were susceptible to CI-934 (MICs mostly 1-8 mg/l): ciprofloxacin had similar activity but enoxacin was less active. Other anaerobes tested were mostly highly susceptible to CI-934 (MICs 1 mg/l or less) but were somewhat less susceptible to enoxacin and ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Activity of pefloxacin and thirteen other antimicrobial agents in vitro against isolates from hospital and genitourinary infections.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of the quinolone derivative pefloxacin was compared with that of three other quinolones, five beta-lactam antibiotics and three aminoglycosides against 367 isolates from hospital patients and from out-patients with genitourinary infections. MIC90 of pefloxacin and norfloxacin for each strain was the same; that of ciprofloxacin was a little lower. All strains except Escherichia coli were resistant to nalidixic acid. Pefloxacin was highly active against Staphylococcus aureus (39 strains; MIC90 1.0 mg/l) and most strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci (56; 4 mg/l), Esch. coli (50; 0.25 mg/l), other enterobacteria (33; 1.0 mg/l) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 6; 0.25 mg/l). With Bacteroides spp. (total 78; 64 mg/l), the fragilis group (23) and the fusobacteria (19) were resistant, but the melaninogenicus-oralis group (31; range 0.06- greater than 64 mg/l) and B. ureolyticus (22; 0.125- greater than 64 mg/l) gave variable results. Amongst genitourinary isolates, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (15) and Haemophilus ducreyi (34) were sensitive (less than 0.06 mg/l) but Gardnerella vaginalis (25) and Mobiluncus spp. (11) were resistant (32 mg/l). Pefloxacin was more active than ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, latamoxef and piperacillin against S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci and than gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin against coagulase-negative staphylococci. No enterobacteria or pseudomonads were resistant to pefloxacin or other quinolones, whereas some were resistant to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides.
TI  - The comparative in-vitro activity of pefloxacin.
AB  - The in-vitro antibacterial activities of pefloxacin, other 4-quinolones and representative beta-lactams and aminoglycosides were assessed by determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Pefloxacin (MICs mostly 0.03-2 mg/l) was highly active against Enterobacteriaceae. Gentamicin had slightly lower activity, and ceftazidime and norfloxacin similar activities to pefloxacin whereas ciprofloxacin was more active. Pefloxacin (MICs 0.03-2 mg/l) was active against Acinetobacter but again ciprofloxacin was more active. Aeromonas was highly susceptible to pefloxacin and norfloxacin (MICs 0.008-0.03 mg/l) as well as to ciprofloxacin (MICs 0.001-0.008 mg/l). Pefloxacin (MICs 1-8 mg/l) had similar activities to ceftazidime and gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa but tobramycin (MICs 0.25-32 mg/l), norfloxacin (MICs 0.25-4 mg/l) and ciprofloxacin (MICs 0.06-1 mg/l) were generally more active. Haemophilus influenzae was susceptible to pefloxacin (MICs 0.008-0.06 mg/l) and to norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin, all of which were more active than ampicillin or ceftazidime. Gardnerella vaginalis was not very susceptible to pefloxacin (MICs 2-8 mg/l), the other 4-quinolones or gentamicin but ampicillin and ceftazidime were highly active. Neisseria gonorrhoeae was very susceptible to pefloxacin and norfloxacin (MICs 0.016-0.12 mg/l) and ciprofloxacin (MICs 0.002-0.008 mg/l). The activity of pefloxacin (MICs 0.25-1 mg/l) was similar to that of ciprofloxacin (MICs 0.12-2 mg/l) but greater than that of norfloxacin (MICs 0.5-4 mg/l) against Staphylococcus aureus. Vancomycin (MICs 1-2 mg/l) had similar activity in vitro but whilst gentamicin was highly active against some isolates, others were resistant. Pefloxacin (MICs mostly 4-32 mg/l) and the other 4-quinolones had lower activity against streptococci (including alpha-, beta-, and non-haemolytic strains, enterococci and pneumococci) than against staphylococci. Benzylpenicillin (or ampicillin in the case of enterococci) were usually more active than any of the 4-quinolones. Bacteroides species, both of the fragilis and melaninogenicus/oralis groups were generally moderately resistant to pefloxacin (MICs 2-32 mg/l) and norfloxacin though ciprofloxacin was more active. Whilst the activity of pefloxacin and the other 4-quinolones was generally somewhat higher against the other anaerobes, ampicillin generally had greater activity.
TI  - Clinical comparison of an agar slide blood culture bottle with tryptic soy broth  and a conventional blood culture bottle with supplemented peptone broth.
AB  - The Roche Septi-Chek biphasic blood culture system with tryptic soy broth was compared with a conventional blood culture bottle with supplemented peptone broth in 6,956 paired blood cultures from adult patients. Both systems were inoculated with equal volumes of blood (5 ml) and incubated aerobically (vented) for 2 weeks. More clinically important bacteria and fungi, including Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli and other Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans and C. tropicalis were recovered from the biphasic system (P less than 0.001). In contrast, more clinically important anaerobic bacteria (P less than 0.001) and Gardnerella vaginalis (P less than 0.05) were recovered in conventional supplemented peptone broth. Staphylococci (P less than 0.01), Enterobacteriaceae other than E. coli (P less than 0.05), and fungi (P less than 0.001) were detected 1 or more days earlier in the biphasic system, whereas streptococci (P less than 0.001) were detected earlier in the conventional bottle. The overall superiority of the agar slide blood culture system compared with conventional blood culture bottles was confirmed by this evaluation. For optimal detection of anaerobic bacteremia, however, the agar slide bottle should be paired with an anaerobic bottle.
TI  - Evaluation of gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid diagnosis of amniotic fluid infection: a preliminary report.
AB  - Gas-liquid chromatography has been proposed as a possible tool in the rapid diagnosis of amniotic fluid infections. The analysis is based on the identification of specific organic acids derived from bacterial metabolism when organisms are present within the amniotic fluid. We retrospectively subjected 69 samples of amniotic fluid which had been obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis to analysis by gas-liquid chromatography. Forty-seven samples were derived from patients who either were in premature labor or had premature rupture of membranes with associated premature labor. Twenty-two specimens which served as a comparison group were obtained from patients who underwent amniocentesis for assessment of fetal maturity. The results obtained from chromatographic analysis are presented, and the possible applications of this technique to the clinical situation are discussed.
TI  - The in-vitro activities of enoxacin and ofloxacin compared with that of ciprofloxacin.
AB  - The in-vitro activities of enoxacin and ofloxacin were compared with that of the  other new 4-quinolone, ciprofloxacin. All three compounds were highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MICs mostly less than 1 mg/l). The other Gram-negative aerobes tested were in general less susceptible, though for Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas species (including aeruginosa) MICs seldom exceeded 8 mg/l. Ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were more active against Gardnerella vaginalis (MICs 0.5-2 mg/l) than was enoxacin (MICs 8-32 mg/l). Staphylococci were susceptible to ofloxacin (MICs 0.12-1 mg/l) and enoxacin (MICs 0.5-2 mg/l) as well as to ciprofloxacin. Streptococci also were mostly sensitive to the compounds though the MICs of enoxacin (4-64 mg/l) were noticeably higher than those of ofloxacin (1-4 mg/l). Anaerobes were in general susceptible though, as with streptococci, ofloxacin, with activity similar to that of ciprofloxacin, was more active than enoxacin. Variants of Enterobacteriaceae with reduced susceptibility were readily selected in the laboratory with either enoxacin or ofloxacin as the selective agent. The MICs of all the 4-quinolones were usually increased four- to 16-fold for these strains; they could therefore be regarded as remaining susceptible to the newer compounds.
