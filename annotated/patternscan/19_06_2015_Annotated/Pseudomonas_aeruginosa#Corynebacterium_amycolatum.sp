TI  == [etiology of ventilator-associated pneumonia at the cardiovascular surgery clinic of iasi].
AB  == aim: we want to assess the etiology of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) and  emergence of resistant phenotypes for greater efficiency of the first-line antimicrobial treatment post-cardiac surgery. the study focuses on patients with  vap post-cardiac surgery at the institute of cardiovascular surgery between april 2nd 2002 and august 27th 2008, divided in two groups, before and after june 14th, 2005. material and methods: the tracheal aspirates were examined quantitatively (microscopy, culture). the isolates with clinical significance (> or = 106 cfu/ml) were identified by standard methods and tested by disk difussion or with  the breakpoints method for susceptibility to antibiotics. results: among the 1527 operated patients, 28 of them were diagnosed with vap through the clinical pulmonary infection score > or = 6. the 9 most common pathogens in vap etiology were pseudomonas aeruginosa 23.81%, acinetobacter baumannii 19.05%, stenotrophomonas maltophilia 11.91%, candida albicans 9.53%, while klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, corynebacterium striatum/amycolatum, pneumocystis jirovecii amounted 4.76% each. acinetobacter baumannii and s.maltophilia appear starting with june 15th, 2005. from that moment on we isolated with a higher frequency the gram-negative bacilli which produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases 15.62%, with multidrug resistance (mdr) 46.86%. the mdr phenotype was more frequent at a.baumannii (15.62%), s. maltophilia (15.62%) and p. aeruginosa (12.50%) compared to k .pneumoniae (3.12%) or e. coli (0%). methicillin-resistant s. aureus was isolated with a 6.25% frequency. conclusions: the most common etiologic agents of ventilator-associated pneumonia post-cardiac surgery are pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and candida albicans. the large use of antibiotics selects infectious agents with intrinsic resistance and multiresistant
