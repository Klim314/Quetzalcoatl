TI  == microbiologic profile of endodontic infections from hiv- and hiv+ patients using  multiple-displacement amplification and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == objective: to compare the microbiota of endodontic infections in necrotic pulp from hiv-negative and hiv-positive subjects. materials and methods: root canal samples from necrotic pulp were collected from 40 hiv- and 20 hiv+ subjects. pulps were amplified using multiple displacement amplification (mda). then, checkerboard dna-dna hybridization was employed to assess the levels of 107 microbial taxa. the percentage of dna probe count and the percentage of teeth colonized by each test species were investigated. significant differences between groups regarding proportions of taxa and prevalence of the test species were sought using the mann-whitney test and the chi-square analysis, respectively. results: the most prevalent taxa detected were dialister pneumosintes, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, streptococcus sobrinus, corynebacterium diphteriae, and helicobacter pylori among hiv- subjects and d. pneumosintes, prevotella tannerae, porphyromonas gingivalis, parvimonas micra, prevotella nigrescens, and  corynebacterium diphtheriae among hiv+ individuals. d. pneumosintes, c. diphtheria, and c. albicans were the most abundant species in the hiv- group, whereas the predominant taxa in hiv+ samples were p. tannerae, d. pneumosintes and olsenella uli. p. tannerae, o. uli, veilonella dispar, bacteroides fragilis,  and actinomyces meyeri were significantly more abundant in hiv+ samples. conclusions: there were significant differences in the prevalence and proportions of specific microbial taxa between hiv- and hiv+ individuals. the root canal microbiota may represent a reservoir of important oral and medical pathogens, mainly in hiv+ individuals.

TI  == gram-positive rods prevailing in teeth with apical periodontitis undergoing root  canal treatment.
AB  == aims: to identify gram-positive rods from root canals of teeth with apical periodontitis and to examine their associations with other species. methodology:  consecutive root canal samples (rcss) from 139 teeth undergoing root canal treatment were analyzed prospectively for cultivable microbes. gram-positive rods in the first rcs submitted after chemo-mechanical preparation were categorised to genus level by selective media and gas-liquid chromatography (glc), and identified to species level by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page). associations between organisms were measured by odds  ratios (or). results: in the first samples submitted a total of 158 gram-positive rods, 115 gram-positive cocci, 26 gram-negative rods and 9 gram-negative cocci, were identified. at genus levels gram-positive rods were classified into: lactobacillus spp. (38%), olsenella spp. (18%), propionibacterium spp. (13%), actinomyces spp. (12%), bifidobacterium spp. (13%) and eubacterium spp. (6%). the most frequent species were olsenella uli, lactobacillus paracasei and propionibacterium propionicum. in subsequent samples taken during treatment, gram-positive rods were also identified, although the number of strains was considerably reduced. positive associations were observed between members of the  genus lactobacilli and gram-positive cocci (or>2). conclusions: olsenella uli and lactobacillus spp. predominated over other gram-positive rods. a possible association exists between lactobacillus spp. and gram-positive cocci in root canals of teeth with apical periodontitis receiving treatment.

TI  == usefulness of the microseq 500 16s ribosomal dna-based bacterial identification system for identification of clinically significant bacterial isolates with ambiguous biochemical profiles.
AB  == due to the inadequate automation in the amplification and sequencing procedures,  the use of 16s rrna gene sequence-based methods in clinical microbiology laboratories is largely limited to identification of strains that are difficult to identify by phenotypic methods. in this study, using conventional full-sequence 16s rrna gene sequencing as the "gold standard," we evaluated the usefulness of the microseq 500 16s ribosomal dna (rdna)-based bacterial identification system, which involves amplification and sequencing of the first 527-bp fragment of the 16s rrna genes of bacterial strains and analysis of the sequences using the database of the system, for identification of clinically significant bacterial isolates with ambiguous biochemical profiles. among 37 clinically significant bacterial strains that showed ambiguous biochemical profiles, representing 37 nonduplicating aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative, anaerobic, and mycobacterium species, the microseq 500 16s rdna-based bacterial identification system was successful in identifying 30 (81.1%) of them. five (13.5%) isolates were misidentified at the genus level (granulicatella adiacens was misidentified as abiotrophia defectiva, helcococcus kunzii was misidentified  as clostridium hastiforme, olsenella uli was misidentified as atopobium rimae, leptotrichia buccalis was misidentified as fusobacterium mortiferum, and bergeyella zoohelcum was misidentified as rimerella anatipestifer), and two (5.4%) were misidentified at the species level (actinomyces odontolyticus was misidentified as actinomyces meyeri and arcobacter cryaerophilus was misidentified as arcobacter butzleri). when the same 527-bp dna sequences of these seven isolates were compared to the known 16s rrna gene sequences in the genbank, five yielded the correct identity, with good discrimination between the  best and second best match sequences, meaning that the reason for misidentification in these five isolates was due to a lack of the 16s rrna gene sequences of these bacteria in the database of the microseq 500 16s rdna-based bacterial identification system. in conclusion, the microseq 500 16s rdna-based bacterial identification system is useful for identification of most clinically important bacterial strains with ambiguous biochemical profiles, but the database of the microseq 500 16s rdna-based bacterial identification system has to be expanded in order to encompass the rarely encountered bacterial species and achieve better accuracy in bacterial identification.
