TI  == a gene-targeted approach to investigate the intestinal butyrate-producing bacterial community.
AB  == background: butyrate, which is produced by the human microbiome, is essential for a well-functioning colon. bacteria that produce butyrate are phylogenetically diverse, which hinders their accurate detection based on conventional phylogenetic markers. as a result, reliable information on this important bacterial group is often lacking in microbiome research. results: in this study we describe a gene-targeted approach for 454 pyrotag sequencing and quantitative  polymerase chain reaction for the final genes in the two primary bacterial butyrate synthesis pathways, butyryl-coa:acetate coa-transferase (but) and butyrate kinase (buk). we monitored the establishment and early succession of butyrate-producing communities in four patients with ulcerative colitis who underwent a colectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis and compared it with three control samples from healthy colons. all patients established an abundant butyrate-producing community (approximately 5% to 26% of the total community) in  the pouch within the 2-month study, but patterns were distinctive among individuals. only one patient harbored a community profile similar to the healthy controls, in which there was a predominance of but genes that are similar to reference genes from acidaminococcus sp., eubacterium sp., faecalibacterium prausnitzii and roseburia sp., and an almost complete absence of buk genes. two patients were greatly enriched in buk genes similar to those of clostridium butyricum and c. perfringens, whereas a fourth patient displayed abundant communities containing both genes. most butyrate producers identified in previous studies were detected and the general patterns of taxa found were supported by 16s rrna gene pyrotag analysis, but the gene-targeted approach provided more detail about the potential butyrate-producing members of the community. conclusions: the presented approach provides quantitative and genotypic insights  into butyrate-producing communities and facilitates a more specific functional characterization of the intestinal microbiome. furthermore, our analysis refines  but and buk reference annotations found in central databases.

TI  == selected microbial groups and short-chain fatty acids profile in a simulated chicken cecum supplemented with two strains of lactobacillus.
AB  == among the bacterial fermentation end products in the chicken cecum, butyrate is of particular importance because of its nutritional properties for the epithelial cell and pathogen inhibitory effects in the gut. an in vitro experiment, operated with batch bioreactor, was conducted to quantify butyric-producing bacteria in a  simulated broiler cecum supplemented with lactobacillus salivarius ssp. salicinius jcm 1230 and lactobacillus agilis jcm 1048 during 24 h of incubation.  selected bacterial species were determined by real-time pcr and short-chain fatty acids and lactate concentrations were monitored. the results showed that after 24 h of incubation, lactobacillus supplementation significantly increased the number of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and faecalibacterium prausnitzii in medium containing cecal content and lactobacilli supplementation (cc + l) compared with  the control (cc). addition of lactobacilli did not alter escherichia coli and clostridium butyricum, whereas it significantly (p < 0.05) reduced salmonella in  treatment cc + l compared with the cc treatment. propionate and butyrate formation were significantly (p < 0.05) increased in treatment cc + l as compared with the cc treatment. lactate was only detected in treatment containing 2 lactobacillus strains. after 24 h of incubation, acetate concentration significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in all treatments. it was suggested that lactate produced by lactobacillus in the cecal content improved the growth of butyric producers such as f. prausnitzii, which significantly increased butyrate  accumulation. additionally, the results showed that butyrate and propionate inhibited salmonella without influencing the e. coli profile.
