TI  - Homology of the gene coding for outer membrane lipoprotein within various Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The mRNA for a major outer membrane lipoprotein from Escherichia coli was found to hybridize specifically with one of the EcoRI and one of the HindIII restriction endonuclease-generated fragments of total DNA from nine bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae: E. coli, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhimurium, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter aerogenes, Edwardsiella tarda, Serratia marcescens, and Erwinia amylovora. However, among the Enterobacteriaceae, DNA from two species of Proteus (P. mirabilis and P. morganii) did not contain any restriction endonuclease fragments that hybridized with the E. coli lipoprotein mRNA. Furthermore, no hybrid bands were detected in four other gram-negative bacteria outside the family Enterobacteriaceae: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter sp. HO1-N, Caulobacter crescentus, and Myxococcus xanthus. Envelope fractions from all bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae tested above cross-reacted with antiserum against the purified E. coli free-form lipoprotein in the Ouchterlony immunodiffusion test. Both species of Proteus, however, gave considerably weaker precipitation lines, in comparison with the intense lines produced by the other members of the family. All of the above four bacteria outside the family Enterobacteriaceae did not cross-react with anti-E. coli lipoprotein serum. From these results, the rate of evolutionary changes in the lipoprotein gene seems to be closely related to that observed for various soluble enzymes of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Ultrastructure of the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane of gram-negative bacteria with different fixation techniques.
AB  - The ultrastructure of the cytoplasmic membrane and cell wall of two strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus morganii, P. vulgaris, Acinetobacter anitratum, Moraxella lacunata, Erwinia amylovora, Acinetobacter sp., and of a plant pathogen, unclassified gram-negative, fixed by the Ryter-Kellenberger procedure, was found to be significantly affected by the use or omission of the uranyl postfixation included in that procedure, and by the presence or absence of calcium in the OsO(4) fixative. The omission of the uranyl treatment results in a less clear profile of both the outer membrane of the cell wall and of the cytoplasmic membrane. The observation of these two membranes is further limited when both uranyl and calcium are omitted. The R-layer and the material covering the surface of the cell wall appear more distinct when the uranyl postfixation is not used. Evidence is given suggesting that the influence of uranyl and calcium ions on the appearance of the outer and cytoplasmic membranes would be primarily due to their action as fixatives, whereas the influence of uranyl on the appearance of the R-layer would be due to a direct action on the peptidoglycan component of this layer. When uranyl acetate is used as a section stain after the embedding in plastic, it improves the observation of the R-layer. In this case, a well contrasted R-layer is consistently observed in all strains studied, provided that the postfixation has been omitted. The frequent difficulty in clearly observing the R-layer in many published micrographs probably results from the common use of uranyl postfixation.
