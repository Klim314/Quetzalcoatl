TI  == suppuration-associated bacteria in patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: suppuration (sup) on probing may be an indication of active periodontal breakdown. the aim of the present study is to analyze which subgingival species are associated with sup in patients with chronic (cp) and aggressive (agp) periodontitis. methods: a total of 156 patients with cp and 66 with agp were submitted to full-mouth periodontal examination and subgingival biofilm sampling (14 sites/patient). the counts of 44 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard. comparisons between groups and sites were analyzed by the mann-whitney and wilcoxon tests, respectively. associations between frequency of sup and bacterial species were analyzed by the spearman correlation coefficient. results: the prevalence of sup in patients with cp was 24.4%, and in patients with agp it was 30.3%, and the percentage of sup sites in the groups was 5.72% +/- 1.06% and 6.96% +/- 1.70%, respectively (p >0.05). sup sites from patients with cp had significantly higher counts of veillonella parvula, dialister pneumosintes, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella nigrescens than sup  sites from patients with agp (p <0.005). significant positive correlations between high frequency of sup and high levels of actinomyces spp, streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were observed in patients with cp (p <0.05). in patients with agp, actinomyces oris, propionibacterium acnes, p. aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  and streptococcus sanguinis were positively associated with sup, whereas prevotella intermedia presented a negative association with sup (p <0.05). conclusions: sup sites from patients with cp harbored significantly higher counts of several periodontal species than sup sites from patients with agp. actinomyces spp., streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, t. forsythia, and certain non-oral pathogens were associated with a high number of sites with sup.

TI  == comparison of the antibacterial effect of modified 3-mix paste versus ultrapex over anaerobic microorganisms from infected root canals of primary teeth: an in vitro study.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial efficacy of a modified 3-mix paste and to compare it with an iodoform paste (ultrapex) against anaerobic microorganisms isolated from root canals of infected or necrotic primary teeth. study design: an in vitro experimental assay was performed over isolated and identified anaerobic microorganisms of 21 samples, in order to compare the antimicrobial ability of both root canal filling materials,  using a disc-diffusion method. results: a total of 21 microbial samples (15 polymicrobial and 6 monomicrobial) were obtained, from which 19 different strains were identified. modified 3-mix paste showed an excellent antimicrobial effect against most of both kinds of microbial samples, although some of them exhibited  resistance; on the other hand, ultrapex showed only minimal antimicrobial ability (null or low categories). clostridium ramosum exhibited the most resistance to both materials. conclusion: the bactericidal effect of the modified 3-mix paste was superior to ultrapex, with a statistically significant difference, against anaerobic microorganisms isolated from infected root canals of primary teeth.

TI  == impact of monocytic cells on recovery of uncultivable bacteria from atherosclerotic lesions.
AB  == objective: epidemiological evidence suggests that infections may contribute to atherogenesis. however, with the exception of chlamydophila pneumoniae, cultivable bacteria have not been recovered from atherosclerotic lesions. therefore, we aimed at developing an approach to recover uncultivable bacteria from atherectomy tissues. methods: we cultured homogenates from atherectomy specimens from seven nonseptic patients undergoing surgery for arterial obstruction either alone or together with thp-1 monocyte-like cells. we performed 16s rdna analysis, biochemical tests, random amplification of polymorphic dna pcr analysis, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) and immunohistofluorescence to identify the cultivated bacteria. wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to determine whether thp-1 treatment yielded a higher number of isolates than did the untreated controls. results: we recovered more bacteria from cocultures of atherectomy specimens with thp-1 cells than atherectomy specimens cultured alone. on average, tissue homogenates incubated with thp-1 cells versus control yielded 124 vs. 22 colony-forming units, a median of 140 vs. 7, respectively (p = 0.02). we recovered 872 isolates of limited number of species, including propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus infantis and the fastidious anaerobe porphyromonas gingivalis, and  confirmed its presence in tissue using double immunofluorescence imaging. qpcr demonstrated the presence of >/=3.5 x 10(3) p. gingivalis genomes per gram of atheromatous tissue. conclusions: these results indicate that viable previously uncultivable bacterial species are present within atheromas. our results suggest  revisiting the hypothesis that infections may have a causative role in atherosclerotic inflammation and have implications for research regarding novel diagnostics and treatments for cardiovascular disease.

TI  == in vivo antimicrobial effects of endodontic treatment procedures as assessed by molecular microbiologic techniques.
AB  == introduction: this culture-independent molecular microbiology study evaluated the antimicrobial effects of chemomechanical preparation supplemented by intracanal medication during treatment of teeth with apical periodontitis. methods: samples  were taken from 24 necrotic root canals at the baseline (s1), after chemomechanical preparation by using 2.5% naocl as the irrigant (s2), and after a 7-day interappointment medication with calcium hydroxide paste in either glycerin (chg) or camphorated paramonochlorophenol/glycerin (chpg) (s3). bacterial, archaeal, and fungal presence was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (pcr), and bacterial identifications were performed by a closed-ended reverse-capture checkerboard approach targeting 28 candidate endodontic pathogens. results: all s1 samples were positive for bacteria but negative for both archaea and fungi. treatment procedures were highly effective in reducing the bacterial levels and number of taxa. overall, 46% of s2 samples and 62.5% of s3 samples were pcr-negative for bacteria. specifically, s2 and s3 samples yielded negative pcr results in 50% and 58% of the canals in the chg group and in 42% and 67% of the canals in the chpg group, respectively. except for comparisons with s1 samples, no other statistically significant differences were observed for intragroup and intergroup comparisons involving s2 and s3. several taxa were still found in s2 and s3 samples, and the most prevalent were propionibacterium acnes and streptococcus species. conclusions: bacterial levels and number of taxa were substantially reduced after chemomechanical preparation and intracanal medication. however, presence of detectable levels of persisting bacteria in many cases indicates that the search for more effective antimicrobial treatment strategies should be stimulated.

TI  == apical root canal microbiota as determined by reverse-capture checkerboard analysis of cryogenically ground root samples from teeth with apical periodontitis.
AB  == introduction: bacteria located in the apical root canal system potentially participate in the pathogenesis of apical periodontitis. detection and identification of apical bacteria can be compromised because of limitations in conventional sampling and identification procedures. this study identified several bacterial taxa in the apical and middle/coronal segments of primarily infected root canal system by using pulverized root segments and a culture-independent molecular method. methods: seventeen extracted teeth with attached apical periodontitis lesions were sectioned to obtain 2 root fragments (apical and middle/coronal segments). root fragments were cryogenically ground, and dna was extracted from samples. after multiple displacement amplification, dna from samples was used as template in a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay targeting 28 bacterial taxa. results: bacterial dna was detected in all samples. the most prevalent taxa in the apical root canal system  were olsenella uli (76.5%), prevotella baroniae (71%), porphyromonas endodontalis (65%), fusobacterium nucleatum (53%), and tannerella forsythia (47%). o. uli, p.  endodontalis, and propionibacterium acnes were as frequently detected in apical samples as they were in middle/coronal samples. p. baroniae, t. forsythia, and f. nucleatum were found more frequently in the apical part of the canal as compared  with matched coronal segments. streptococcus species were more prevalent in middle/coronal samples. the median and mean of shared bacterial taxa between matched apical and middle/coronal segments were 27% and 41%, respectively. conclusions: several candidate endodontic pathogens were very prevalent in the apical root canal system. the apical microbiota was usually complex and differed  in species composition when compared with the microbiota of middle/coronal samples from the same tooth.

TI  == identification of bacteria enduring endodontic treatment procedures by a combined reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and reverse-capture checkerboard  approach.
AB  == introduction: this study identified the bacterial taxa enduring endodontic treatment procedures by using a combined 16s ribosomal rna-based reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) and reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization approach. methods: samples were taken from infected canals of 15 teeth with apical periodontitis before treatment (s1), after chemomechanical preparation with naocl as the irrigant (s2), and after interappointment medication with a calcium hydroxide paste (s3). bacterial presence was first screened by a dna-based single pcr assay. rna extracts were subjected to rt-pcr, and the resulting products were surveyed for the presence of 28 targeted taxa by using the checkerboard method. results: bacteria were found in all s1 samples. detectable levels of bacterial ribosomal rna, used as an indicator of viability, were observed in 60% of the cases after chemomechanical preparation and 53% after intracanal medication. the most prevalent taxa in s1 were olsenella uli (67%), pyramidobacter piscolens (60%), streptococcus species (53%), and bacteroidetes clone x083 (53%). streptococcus species (47%), fusobacterium nucleatum (40%), and o. uli (33%) prevailed in s2, whereas streptococcus species (47%), propionibacterium acnes (27%), and o. uli (27%) were the most frequent taxa in s3. conclusions: the present study with a combined molecular approach revealed that bacterial diversity was overall markedly reduced by treatment procedures. although bacterial taxa more frequently identified in post-treatment samples emerge as potential risk factors for persistent disease, this remains to be determined by longitudinal studies.

TI  == commensal oral bacteria antigens prime human dendritic cells to induce th1, th2 or treg differentiation.
AB  == in various immunopathologic conditions, bacterial flora induce an immune response which results in inflammatory manifestations, e.g. periapical granuloma. dendritic cells provide the main orchestration of specific immune responses. the  aim of our study was to test the capacity of distinct oral bacterial antigens (prepared from streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides spp.) to prime human dendritic cells for stimulation of the t-lymphocyte response. to assess the t-lymphocyte response, the expression of cd25, cd69, intracellular interferon gamma (cifn-gamma), and intracellular interleukin 4 (cil-4) was determined. dendritic cells were prepared from leukocyte buffy coat from healthy blood donors. monocytes were stimulated with il-4 and gm-csf and dendritic cells activated with bacterial lysates. cell suspensions contained up to 90% dendritic cells, which represented 2-12% of the initial number of mononuclear cells. lymphocyte subsets that developed in lymphocyte cultures after 1 week of stimulation were analyzed by flow cytometry. dendritic cells, primed with antigens of bacteroides fragilis have shown significantly higher activation  and expression of intercellular ifn-gamma by t lymphocytes compared to negative controls. the dendritic cells primed with antigens of p. acnes had no effect on t-lymphocyte activation or cytokine production; instead they induced differentiation of t lymphocytes into cd25bright cells (regulatory t cells) with  a potentially inhibitory effect on immune response. dendritic cells primed with antigens of s. mitis induced increased expression of cil-4. we conclude that commensal oral bacteria antigens prepared from b. fragilis, s. mitis, and p. acnes prime human dendritic cells to induce th1, th2, and t(reg) differentiation, respectively. this may advance our understanding of immunopathologic manifestations in the oral cavity and offer new possibilities for redirecting immune responses in mucosal vaccination.

TI  == in vivo evaluation of the effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on salivary bacteria using the checkerboard method.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on different species of the oral microbiota. methodology: saliva samples were collected from 20 subjects with good oral health, diluted and plated onto blood agar medium. the subjects were asked to place the strip (listerine pocketpaks) on the tongue allowing it to dissolve. after 30 minutes, new saliva samples were collected again and the plates with the samples were incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees c for seven days. colony counts (cfu/ml) were determined for each sample. the colonies on the plates were washed with 1 ml of te buffer, and the bacterial suspensions were processed for the identification of 24 species by dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. differences in total counts, prevalence, and levels of the species evaluated before and after placement of the strips were determined by wilcoxon sign rank and chi-square tests. results: a modest increase in the total bacterial number in saliva from 1.4 x 10(8) to 1.7 x 10(8) bacterial cells  was observed 30 minutes after the strip placement, although this change was not significant (p = 0.632). most of the species reduced in frequency and/or levels,  including the pathogens a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, e. corrodens, fusobacterium spp., p. intermedia, and s. noxia, as well as the beneficial species a. meyeri, a. georgia, a. gerencseriae, a. odontolyticus, and p. acnes after strip placement. in contrast, a. viscosus, p. melaninogenica, p. gingivalis, p. micros, streptococcus spp., t. forsythensis, and v. parvula presented an increase in prevalence and/or levels. these changes were not statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons (p > 0.0022).  conclusion: the use of the essential oil-containing oral strips resulted in a short-term small increase in the total number of salivary microorganisms. in addition, a not significant decrease of certain periodontopathogens, and an increase in species compatible with oral health were observed.

TI  == single species biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates on gutta-percha points.
AB  == the participation of bacterial biofilms in the over-filled gutta-percha points associated with refractory periapical periodontitis has recently been reported. this study investigated the initial biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) on gutta-percha points in vitro. each bacterial strain was suspended in 100% cell culture medium or in culture medium containing 4.5, 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the bacterial suspensions were then co-incubated anaerobically with gutta-percha  points for 7 d. the gutta-percha points were processed for scanning electron microscopic observation and examined for biofilm presence and thickness. e. faecalis, strep. sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus biofilms were generated on the surfaces of the specimens incubated in culture medium supplemented with 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the e. faecalis and strep. sanguis biofilms were significantly thicker than those of strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus. no biofilms were detected on the specimens incubated with f. nucleatum, prop. acnes, porph. gingivalis and prev. intermedia. these findings suggest that gram-positive facultative anaerobes have the ability  to colonize and form extracellular matrices on gutta-percha points, while serum plays a crucial role in biofilm formation.

TI  == beta-lactamase production and antimicrobial susceptibility of subgingival bacteria from refractory periodontitis.
AB  == this study assessed the extent of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in subgingival plaque samples obtained from 25 patients with refractory marginal periodontitis in the usa. beta-lactamase-positive isolates were characterized using commercial diagnostic kits and partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. the susceptibilities to different antimicrobial agents were tested and, in addition,  the isolates were screened for the presence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases  (esbls). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were detected in 18 (72%) patients. the most prominent beta-lactamase-producing organisms belonged to the anaerobic genus prevotella. other enzyme-producing anaerobic strains were fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes and peptostreptococcus sp. facultative bacteria, such as burkholderia spp., ralstonia pickettii, capnocytophaga spp., bacillus spp., staphylococcus spp. and neisseria sp., were also detected among the enzyme-producers. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ampicillin and  amoxicillin were in the range 1.5-256 micrograms/ml and 4-256 micrograms/ml, respectively, for the isolates of the prevotella species. all prevotella isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate and metronidazole, but they showed variable resistance to tetracyclines. two of the prevotella isolates had high mics of cefotaxime and ceftazidime. esbl activity was not detected in any of the  beta-lactamase-producing isolates by the etest method. thus, our study demonstrated a wide variety of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria that may play a  role in refractory periodontal disease.

TI  == effects of instrumentation, irrigation and dressing with calcium hydroxide on infection in pulpless teeth with periapical bone lesions.
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate the fate of microorganisms in root canals of teeth with infected pulps and periapical bone lesions with and without  the use of calcium hydroxide medication. methodology: endodontic samples were cultured and microorganisms were counted and identified in 43 teeth before (sample 1) and after (sample 2) treatment during the first visit and before (sample 3) and after (sample 4) treatment during the second visit. in the first visit teeth were instrumented and half of the teeth were filled with a thick slurry of calcium hydroxide in sterile saline. the other teeth were obturated with gutta-percha and ah-2 6 sealer. after 4 weeks the teeth with calcium-hydroxide were accessed again and after microbiological sampling they were obturated with gutta-percha and ah-26 sealer. results: the mean total colony forming unit (cfu) counts of positive samples dropped significantly as a result of canal preparation during the first visit from 1.0 x 10(6) to 1.8 x 10(3) (between samples 1 and 2) but increased to 9.3 x 10(3) in the period between the  two visits (sample 2 and 3). there was no difference in mean total cfu counts of  positive samples between the end of the first (sample 2) and the end of the second visit (sample 4). the most frequently isolated species were prevotella intermedia, capnocytophaga spp.. actinomyces odontolyticus. propionibacterium acnes and peptostreptococcus micros. conclusions: although a calcium hydroxide paste was placed in the prepared canals, the number of positive canals had increased in the period between visits. however, the number of microorganisms had only increased to 0.93% of the original number of cfu (sample 1). it is concluded that a calcium hydroxide and sterile saline slurry limits but does not totally prevent regrowth of endodontic bacteria.

TI  == antibacterial properties of electron beam-sterilized gutta-percha cones.
AB  == the purpose of the study was to determine the effect of electron beam sterilization on gutta-percha cones (gpcs) at different times after sterilization. an agar diffusion test was used with -one aerobic bacterium (bacillus subtilis) and five oral anaerobic bacteria (fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, propionibacterium acnes, and veillonella parvula). with each microorganism 30 agar plates were prepared, evenly distributed among three groups (group 1: unsterilized gpcs; groups 2 and 3: gpcs sterilized by electron beam irradiation 5 months and 5 yr before, respectively). one gpc of the selected group was placed in each plate. after incubation the area of inhibition was read on the agar plates. inhibition of growth was significantly different for the tested microorganisms. however no significant difference was observed between the sterilized and unsterilized gpcs. both the tested sterilized and unsterilized gpcs impair the growth of endodontic  pathogens, with no influence of the time elapsed since sterilization.

TI  == assessment of periradicular microbiota by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == in the present study the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. in group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. the gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. bacterial dna was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. the mean number (+/- sd) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in group 2 (p < 0.001). the majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from group 1 than from group 2. the differences were most notable for campylobacter gracilis, porphyromonas endodontalis, propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, streptococcus constellatus and actinomyces naeslundii i. bacterial species such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. also, p. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. the data supported the idea that  following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. the study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. the detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.

TI  == bacteriostatic effects of hyaluronic acid.
AB  == background: this investigation is one of a series of projects seeking to ascertain whether hyaluronic acid (ha) is therapeutically effective in tissue regeneration procedures. the rationale for these investigations is to test the hypothesis that ha can serve as a bioabsorbable carrier for other substrates as well as itself actively promote the regeneration of tissue. methods: in this paper, we report on the bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties of 3 molecular weight formulations of recombinant ha (low, 141 kd; medium, 757 kd; and high, 1,300 kd) on selected oral and non-oral microorganisms in the planktonic phase. three concentrations of each ha formulation were screened, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/ml, using a standard broth culture assay. results: recombinant ha exerted varied bacteriostatic effects on all the bacterial strains tested depending on its molecular weight (mw) and concentration. the high concentrations of the medium mw ha had the greatest bacteriostatic effect, particularly on the actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella oris, staphylococcus aureus, and propionibacterium acnes strains. the 1.0 mg/ml concentration of high mw ha had the greatest overall bacteriostatic effect, inhibiting the growth of all 6 bacterial strains tested. among the bacterial strains studied, ha was found to have no bactericidal effects, regardless of concentration or molecular weight. conclusions: the results of this study suggest that ha in the mw range of 1,300 kd may prove beneficial in minimizing bacterial contamination of surgical wounds  when used in guided tissue regeneration surgery.

TI  == subgingival microflora associated with nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to examine the composition of subgingival plaque of 140 periodontal lesions in 35 patients with cardiovascular disorders who were administered nifedipine and manifested nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth (go). age was inversely associated with the go. plaque index and bleeding index showed a significant association with go, while nifedipine dosage and duration of nifedipine therapy were not found to be significant predictors of go. the gingival inflammation as expressed in the logistic regression model by the interaction term color x tone was found to be significantly associated with the go. statistically significant differences between the groups of comparable probing depth and different degrees of go were detected for propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium mortiferum, fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium varium and selenomonas sputigena in deep and enlarged lesions. significantly more frequently isolated were the bacterial species eubacterium alactolyticum, campylobacter concisus, c. gingivalis, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, f. mortiferum, f. nucleatum, and f. varium from the more enlarged lesions (go >3).

TI  == bacteraemia caused by periodontal probing.
AB  == bacteraemia of oral origin may result in infective endocarditis in susceptible individuals. the aim of this pilot study was to investigate the occurrence of bacteraemia due to periodontal probing. thirty patients (15 male, 15 female; mean age 42.7 years) with untreated periodontitis were investigated. all were free of  significant medical disorders and none had taken antibiotics in the previous month. prior to and immediately following periodontal probing, 20 ml of venous blood were obtained from each patient and inoculated into aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles and incubated. negative bottles were monitored continuously for three weeks before being discarded. periodontal probing consisted of measuring pockets at six points around each tooth and recording the presence or absence of bleeding. a positive bacteraemia was recorded for three of the patients prior to probing. one patient exhibited prevotella species whilst two exhibited skin commensals. following probing, 13 patients (43 per cent) exhibited bacteraemia of oral origin. viridans streptococci were the most common isolates (45 per cent). no significant correlations were found between bacteraemia and the severity of periodontitis or extent of bleeding on probing. the results indicate  that periodontal probing can cause bacteraemia in patients with periodontitis. it would be advisable for patients considered at risk of developing infective endocarditis to receive antibiotic prophylaxis for periodontal probing if they have radiographic evidence of periodontitis.

TI  == degradation of host protease inhibitors and activation of plasminogen by proteolytic enzymes from porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola.
AB  == bacterial proteases may participate in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases through their action on host proteins. in the present study, the ability of selected periodontopathogens, as well as two proteases isolated from porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola, to degrade host protease inhibitors was evaluated. the activation of human plasminogen by the two bacterial proteases was also investigated. proteolytic breakdown of host protease inhibitors (alpha-1-antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, antithrombin iii, antiplasmin and cystatin c) was evaluated by sds-page. the 80 kda trypsin-like protease of p. gingivalis completely digested the six protease inhibitors under investigation, whereas the 95 kda chymotrypsin-like protease of  t. denticola was slightly less active, more particularly on alpha 2-macroglobulin and cystatin c. when whole cells from a number of oral bacterial species were tested, the most significant degradation was obtained with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and capnocytophaga spp. peptostreptococcus micros and propionibacterium acnes had only some degradative activity on selected inhibitors, whereas three bacterial species, actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus and fusobacterium nucleatum, had no  effect on the protease inhibitors. the 80 kda protease of p. gingivalis demonstrated strong plasminogen activation, whereas no such activity was associated with the 95 kda protease of t. denticola. this study indicates the high potential of some periodontal pathogens to destroy protease inhibitors and activate plasminogen. this may result in an uncontrolled degradation of periodontal tissues and a rapid progression of the disease.

TI  == bacteremia in conjunction with endodontic therapy.
AB  == this study characterizes oral microorganisms believed to have spread from the root canal into the blood stream during and after endodontic therapy of teeth with asymptomatic apical periodontitis. microbiological samples were taken under  aseptic conditions from the root canal of 26 single-rooted teeth in 26 patients.  in the endodontic treatment of 13 of the patients (group 1), the first 3 reamers, sizes 15, 20 and 25, were used to a level 2 mm beyond the apical foramen. in the  other 13 patients (group 2), the instrumentation ended inside the root canal 1 mm short of the apical foramen. blood samples were taken from the patients during the instrumentation and 10 min after the treatment was completed. anaerobic microorganisms were isolated from all root canals. in 7 patients of group 1, propionibacterium acnes, peptostreptococcus prevotii, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and saccharomyces cerevisiae were recovered from the blood. in 4 patients of group 2, p. intermedia, actinomyces israelii, streptococcus intermedius and streptococcus sanguis were isolated from the blood. biochemical tests and antibiograms revealed that the isolates from the root canal and blood had identical profiles within the patients, strongly suggesting that the microorganisms isolated from the blood had the root canal as their source.

TI  == evidence for the absence of hyaluronidase activity in porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to evaluate the ability of porphyromonas gingivalis to degrade hyaluronic acid. no hyaluronidase activity was detected using a turbidimetric method, whereas a standard plate assay showed a positive reaction for p. gingivalis. we postulated that the high proteolytic activity of p. gingivalis may account for this observation. a modified plate assay was designed to avoid false-positive reactions caused by proteolytic bacteria. the new assay, based on the formation of a water-insoluble salt between hyaluronic acid and the polyanion cetylpyridinium chloride, indicated that p. gingivalis does not have hyaluronidase activity. by this modified plate method, it was found that among 24 different oral bacterial species tested, propionibacterium acnes and prevotella oris were the only species that possess hyaluronidase activity.

TI  == enumeration of subgingival species on primary isolation plates using colony lifts.
AB  == this study evaluated the feasibility of using a colony lift method and dna probes to enumerate bacterial species cultured on primary isolation plates. fourteen digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal dna probes representing 12 subgingival species were validated by hybridization with colony lifts prepared from 249 reference strains of 51 species grown on trypticase soy agar plates supplemented  with 5% sheep blood. colonies of reference strains were lifted onto nytran filters from plates and treated to lyse cells, remove cellular proteins, denature and fix microbial dna to the filters. positive reactions were detected with an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and revealed by bromo-chloro-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium. cross-reactions were not observed for 13/14 probes, but 2 strains of streptococcus mitis reacted with  the probe to streptococcus sanguis ii. subgingival plaque samples were taken by means of a sterile curette from mesiobuccal surfaces of teeth present in each of  26 subjects with differing periodontal disease states. samples were dispersed, diluted, plated and incubated anaerobically for 7 d at 35 degrees c. colonies were lifted as described above. filters were cut into sections and hybridized with the 14 digoxigenin-labeled dna probes. the probes were used to enumerate the test species and the total number of isolates was determined in 711 plaque samples. the colony lift method and dna probes provided a sensitive, economical and quantitative method for enumerating cultivable microbial species in subgingival plaque samples. in addition, the amplification provided by growing the organisms on agar plates facilitated determination of numbers of organisms in small plaque samples, such as those from healthy sites.

TI  == bacterial contamination in irreversible hydrocolloid impression material and gingival retraction cord.
AB  == this study tested two dental materials in factory-sealed containers for the presence of bacteria that may be a source of infection. twenty samples of two dental materials found to have contamination in a pilot study were taken from unopened containers using a sterile technique. the samples were inoculated onto chocolate agar plates and into thioglycolate broths with appropriate controls. plates were examined, colonies were enumerated, gram stained, and identified. the resulting contamination frequencies were compared for statistical significance using fisher's exact test. organisms were isolated from 10% of the negative inoculation control agar plates, while none of the control broths showed contamination. the alginate (irreversible hydrocolloid) showed contamination in 50% of the plates and in 65% of the broths (p less than 0.05). the retraction cord had a small sample size and yielded organisms on 5% of the sample plates and in 20% of the thioglycolate broths (p greater than 0.05).

TI  == ability of oral bacteria to degrade fibronectin.
AB  == the fibronectin-degrading ability of 116, mainly oral, strains was assayed by using plasma-derived fibronectin adsorbed to a polystyrene surface. ability to degrade fibronectin was revealed in strains of bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides loeschii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, peptococcus prevotii, clostridium sporogenes, and propionibacterium acnes. the fibronectinolytic activity of subgingival bacteriological samples was found to be related to the presence of b. gingivalis  and b. intermedius. in addition, strains of the nonoral bacteroides species b. asaccharolyticus and b. fragilis showed fibronectin-degrading ability. no such ability was detected in the oral strains tested of streptococcus, veillonella, actinomyces, lactobacillus, actinobacillus, capnocytophaga, fusobacterium, or haemophilus species.

TI  == effect of bacterial products on inflammatory reactions in the dental pulp.
AB  == culture filtrates (extracellular components) and material obtained from disintegrated cells (intracellular components) of cultured plaque bacteria were studied for their capacity to induce inflammatory reactions in the dental pulp. class v cavities were prepared on the buccal surface of 94 teeth: 42 test and 52  control teeth in six adult monkeys. lyophilized bacterial components were sealed  into the test cavities either alone or following an 8-h topical application of a  solution of the same components in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs). culture medium and pbs were applied in two sets of control cavities. a third set was restored with zinc oxide-eugenol cement. the animals were killed 32 h after the initiation of the experiment and the pulps were examined histologically. teeth treated trophil leukocytes in the area of the pulp subjacent to the cut dentin tubules. abscess formation was frequently found. the severe reactions which developed were independent of differences between individual animals and differences in thickness of the remaining dentin. the controls showed damage to the odontoblasts but little or no neutrophil infiltration. the findings confirm that products of bacteria applied to exposed dentin initiate inflammatory reactions in the dental pulp.
