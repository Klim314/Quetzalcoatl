TI  - Selenium utilization in thioredoxin and catalytic advantage provided by selenocysteine.
AB  - Thioredoxin (Trx) is a major thiol-disulfide reductase that plays a role in many  biological processes, including DNA replication and redox signaling. Although selenocysteine (Sec)-containing Trxs have been identified in certain bacteria, their enzymatic properties have not been characterized. In this study, we expressed a selenoprotein Trx from Treponema denticola, an oral spirochete, in Escherichia coli and characterized this selenoenzyme and its natural cysteine (Cys) homologue using E. coli Trx1 as a positive control. (75)Se metabolic labeling and mutation analyses showed that the SECIS (Sec insertion sequence) of T. denticola selenoprotein Trx is functional in the E. coli Sec insertion system with specific selenium incorporation into the Sec residue. The selenoprotein Trx exhibited approximately 10-fold higher catalytic activity than the Sec-to-Cys version and natural Cys homologue and E. coli Trx1, suggesting that Sec confers higher catalytic activity on this thiol-disulfide reductase. Kinetic analysis also showed that the selenoprotein Trx had a 30-fold higher Km than Cys-containing homologues, suggesting that this selenoenzyme is adapted to work efficiently with high concentrations of substrate. Collectively, the results of this study support the hypothesis that selenium utilization in oxidoreductase systems is primarily due to the catalytic advantage provided by the rare amino acid, Sec.
TI  - Construction of CoA-dependent 1-butanol synthetic pathway functions under aerobic conditions in Escherichia coli.
AB  - 1-Butanol is an important industrial platform chemical and an advanced biofuel. While various groups have attempted to construct synthetic pathways for 1-butanol production, efforts to construct a pathway that functions under aerobic conditions have met with limited success. Here, we constructed a CoA-dependent 1-butanol synthetic pathway that functions under aerobic conditions in Escherichia coli, by expanding the previously reported (R)-1,3-butanediol synthetic pathway. The pathway consists of phaA (acetyltransferase) and phaB (NADPH-dependent acetoacetyl-CoA reductase) from Ralstonia eutropha, phaJ ((R)-specific enoyl-CoA hydratase) from Aeromonas caviae, ter (trans-enoyl-CoA reductase) from Treponema denticola, bld (butylraldehyde dehydrogenase) from Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum, and inherent alcohol dehydrogenase(s) from E. coli. To evaluate the potential of this pathway for 1-butanol production, culture conditions, including volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient (kLa) and pH were optimized in a mini-jar fermenter. Under optimal conditions, 1-butanol was produced at a concentration of up to 8.60gL(-1) after 46h of fed-batch cultivation.
TI  - Bipartite Topology of Treponema pallidum Repeat Proteins C/D and I: OUTER MEMBRANE INSERTION, TRIMERIZATION, AND PORIN FUNCTION REQUIRE A C-TERMINAL beta-BARREL DOMAIN.
AB  - We previously identified Treponema pallidum repeat proteins TprC/D, TprF, and TprI as candidate outer membrane proteins (OMPs) and subsequently demonstrated that TprC is not only a rare OMP but also forms trimers and has porin activity. We also reported that TprC contains N- and C-terminal domains (TprC(N) and TprC(C)) orthologous to regions in the major outer sheath protein (MOSP(N) and MOSP(C)) of Treponema denticola and that TprC(C) is solely responsible for beta-barrel formation, trimerization, and porin function by the full-length protein. Herein, we show that TprI also possesses bipartite architecture, trimeric structure, and porin function and that the MOSP(C)-like domains of native TprC and TprI are surface-exposed in T. pallidum, whereas their MOSP(N)-like domains are tethered within the periplasm. TprF, which does not contain a MOSP(C)-like domain, lacks amphiphilicity and porin activity, adopts an extended inflexible structure, and, in T. pallidum, is tightly bound to the protoplasmic cylinder. By thermal denaturation, the MOSP(N) and MOSP(C)-like domains of TprC and TprI are highly thermostable, endowing the full-length proteins with impressive conformational stability. When expressed in Escherichia coli with PelB signal sequences, TprC and TprI localize to the outer membrane, adopting bipartite topologies, whereas TprF is periplasmic. We propose that the MOSP(N)-like domains enhance the structural integrity of the cell envelope by anchoring the beta-barrels within the periplasm. In addition to being bona fide T. pallidum rare outer membrane proteins, TprC/D and TprI represent a new class of dual function, bipartite bacterial OMP.
TI  - Evidence that TP_0144 of Treponema pallidum is a thiamine-binding protein.
AB  - Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), the biologically active form of thiamine (also known as vitamin B1), is an essential cofactor for several important enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, and therefore, it is required for all living organisms. We recently found that a thiamine-binding protein (TDE_0143) is essential for the survival of Treponema denticola, an important bacterial pathogen that is associated with human periodontitis. In this report, we provide experimental evidence showing that TP_0144, a homolog of TDE_0143 from the syphilis spirochete Treponema pallidum, is a thiamine-binding protein that has biochemical features and functions that are similar to those of TDE_0143. First, structural modeling analysis reveal that both TDE_0143 and TP_0144 contain a conserved TPP-binding site and share similar structures to the thiamine-binding protein of Escherichia coli. Second, biochemical analysis shows that these two proteins bind to TPP with similar dissociation constant (Kd) values (TDE_0143, Kd of 36.50 nM; TP_0144, Kd of 32.62 nM). Finally, heterologous expression of TP_0144 in a DeltaTDE_0143 strain, a previously constructed TDE_0143 mutant of T. denticola, fully restores its growth and TPP uptake when exogenous thiamine is limited. Collectively, these results indicate that TP_0144 is a thiamine-binding protein that is indispensable for T. pallidum to acquire exogenous thiamine, a key nutrient for bacterial survival. In addition, the studies shown in this report further underscore the feasibility of using T. denticola as a platform to study the biology and pathogenicity of T. pallidum and probably other uncultivable treponemal species as well.
TI  - Characterization of C-S Lyase from C. diphtheriae: a possible target for new antimicrobial drugs.
AB  - The emergence of antibiotic resistance in microbial pathogens requires the identification of new antibacterial drugs. The biosynthesis of methionine is an attractive target because of its central importance in cellular metabolism. Moreover, most of the steps in methionine biosynthesis pathway are absent in mammals, lowering the probability of unwanted side effects. Herein, detailed biochemical characterization of one enzyme required for methionine biosynthesis, a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP-) dependent C-S lyase from Corynebacterium diphtheriae, a pathogenic bacterium that causes diphtheria, has been performed. We overexpressed the protein in E. coli and analyzed substrate specificity, pH dependence of steady state kinetic parameters, and ligand-induced spectral transitions of the protein. Structural comparison of the enzyme with cystalysin from Treponema denticola indicates a similarity in overall folding. We used site-directed mutagenesis to highlight the importance of active site residues Tyr55, Tyr114, and Arg351, analyzing the effects of amino acid replacement on catalytic properties of enzyme. Better understanding of the active site of C. diphtheriae C-S lyase and the determinants of substrate and reaction specificity from this work will facilitate the design of novel inhibitors as antibacterial therapeutics.
TI  - Butyrate production in engineered Escherichia coli with synthetic scaffolds.
AB  - Butyrate pathway was constructed in recombinant Escherichia coli using the genes  from Clostridium acetobutylicum and Treponema denticola. However, the pathway constructed from exogenous enzymes did not efficiently convert carbon flux to butyrate. Three steps of the productivity enhancement were attempted in this study. First, pathway engineering to delete metabolic pathways to by-products successfully improved the butyrate production. Second, synthetic scaffold protein that spatially co-localizes enzymes was introduced to improve the efficiency of the heterologous pathway enzymes, resulting in threefold improvement in butyrate production. Finally, further optimizations of inducer concentrations and pH adjustment were tried. The final titer of butyrate was 4.3 and 7.2 g/L under batch and fed-batch cultivation, respectively. This study demonstrated the importance of synthetic scaffold protein as a useful tool for optimization of heterologous butyrate pathway in E. coli.
TI  - [Role of infectious agents in the emergence of malignant tumors].
AB  - According to the data of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC),  at least 6 virus species (HPV, EBV, HHV-8/KSHV, HTLV-1, HBV, HCV), 4 helminthes species (Schistosoma haematobium and japonicum, Opisthorchis viverrini, Clonorchis sinensis) and I bacterium species (Helicobacter pylori) have been proved to be capable of causing the development of cancer. The analysis of the data available shows that Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), John Cunningham polyomavirus (JCV), monkey virus 40 (SV40), cytomegalovirus (CMV), xenotropic murine leukemia virus (XMRV), Helicobacter bilis and hepaticus, Campylobacter jejuni, Fusobacterium varium, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Prevotella spp., Streptococcus bovis and anginosus, Treponema denticola, Salmonella typhi, paratyphi and typhimurium, Borrelia burgdorferi, Bartonella spp., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, trachomatis and psittaci, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Propionibacterium acnes, Tropheryma whippelii, Schistosoma mansoni, Opistorchis felineus, Strongyloides stercoralis, Taenia solium, Candida spp., Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Histoplasma capsulatum and Trichomonas vaginalis can also be potential etiological agents of cancer. Apparently, detection of new associations between infectious agents and risk of the development of cancer will facilitate progress in elaboration of prophylaxis measures, early diagnostic methods and, probably, methods of treatment of malignant tumors.
TI  - Association of red complex, A. actinomycetemcomitans and non-oral bacteria with periodontal diseases.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pathogens related to systemic infections have been detected in the periodontal microbiota. The relationship amongst these pathogens, periodontal bacteria and periodontal clinical status is poorly understood. This study evaluated the association amongst red complex, A. actinomycetemcomitans (A.a) and non-oral pathogenic bacteria in subjects with good periodontal health (PH), gingivitis (G), chronic (CP) and aggressive (AP) periodontitis. METHODS: Subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 51 PH, 42 G, 219 CP and 90 AP subjects. The presence and levels of A.a, red complex (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola), Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus were determined by DNA probes and DNA-DNA hybridization technique. RESULTS: CP and AP subjects presented significantly higher prevalence and levels of A.a, red complex and A. baumannii than G and PH individuals (p<0.01), whereas S. aureus was detected in lower frequency and counts in AP as compared to the other groups (p<0.001). The predictor variables age, prevalence of red complex, and the presence of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa were strongly associated with the frequency of sites with PD and CAL >/=5 mm. Increasing age (OR 1.08), high frequency of red complex (OR 6.10), and the presence of A.a with P. aeruginosa (OR 1.90) were associated with periodontal disease (p<0.001). Subjects harbouring a high prevalence of A.a, A. baumannii, and red complex with P. aeruginosa were more likely to have AP than CP (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Putative periodontal pathogens and non-oral bacteria alone or in association were strongly associated with periodontitis.
TI  - Characterization of a novel family of fibronectin-binding proteins with M23 peptidase domains from Treponema denticola.
AB  - Interactions with fibronectin are important in the virulence strategies of a range of disease-related bacteria. The periodontitis-associated oral spirochaete Treponema denticola expresses at least two fibronectin-binding proteins, designated Msp (major surface protein) and OppA (oligopeptide-binding protein homologue). To identify other T. denticola outer membrane fibronectin-binding proteins, the amino acid sequence of the Treponema pallidum fibronectin-binding protein Tp0155 was used to survey the T. denticola genome. Seven T. denticola genes encoding orthologous proteins were identified. All but two were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified recombinant proteins bound fibronectin. Using antibodies to the N-terminal region of Tp0155, it was demonstrated that T. denticola TDE2318, with highest homology to Tp0155, was cell surface localized. Like Tp0155, the seven T. denticola proteins contained an M23 peptidase domain and four (TDE2318, TDE2753, TDE1738, TDE1297) contained one or two LysM domains. M23 peptidases can degrade peptidoglycan whereas LysM domains recognize carbohydrate polymers. In addition, TDE1738 may act as a bacteriocin based on homology with other bacterial lysins and the presence of an adjacent gene encoding a putative immunity factor. Collectively, these results suggest that T. denticola expresses fibronectin-binding proteins associated with the cell surface that may also have cell wall modifying or lytic functions.
TI  - A simplified erythromycin resistance cassette for Treponema denticola mutagenesis.
AB  - The primary selectable marker for the genetic studies of Treponema denticola is a hybrid gene cassette containing both ermF and ermAM (ermB) genes. ErmB functions in Escherichia coli, while ErmF has been assumed to confer resistance in T. denticola. We demonstrate here that ErmB is sufficient for erythromycin selection in T. denticola and that the native ermB promoter drives ErmB expression.
TI  - Killing of Treponema denticola by mouse peritoneal macrophages.
AB  - Treponema denticola has been identified as an important cause of periodontal disease and hypothesized to be involved in extra-oral infections. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of T. denticola cell length and motility during mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro uptake. Macrophages, incubated under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, produced a similar amount of TNF-alpha when stimulated with Escherichia coli LPS. The uptake of FlgE- and CfpA-deficient mutants of T. denticola was significantly increased compared with the wild-type strain, due to cell size or lack of motility. Opsonization with specific antibodies considerably improved the treponemes' uptake. These results suggest that macrophages, in addition to other phagocytes, could play an important role in the control of T. denticola infection, and that the raising of specific antibodies could improve the efficacy of the immune response toward T. denticola, either at an oral site or during dissemination.
TI  - Cryo-electron tomography elucidates the molecular architecture of Treponema pallidum, the syphilis spirochete.
AB  - Cryo-electron tomography (CET) was used to examine the native cellular organization of Treponema pallidum, the syphilis spirochete. T. pallidum cells appeared to form flat waves, did not contain an outer coat and, except for bulges over the basal bodies and widening in the vicinity of flagellar filaments, displayed a uniform periplasmic space. Although the outer membrane (OM) generally was smooth in contour, OM extrusions and blebs frequently were observed, highlighting the structure's fluidity and lack of attachment to underlying periplasmic constituents. Cytoplasmic filaments converged from their attachment points opposite the basal bodies to form arrays that ran roughly parallel to the flagellar filaments along the inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane (CM). Motile treponemes stably attached to rabbit epithelial cells predominantly via their tips. CET revealed that T. pallidum cell ends have a complex morphology and assume at least four distinct morphotypes. Images of dividing treponemes and organisms shedding cell envelope-derived blebs provided evidence for the spirochete's complex membrane biology. In the regions without flagellar filaments, peptidoglycan (PG) was visualized as a thin layer that divided the periplasmic space into zones of higher and lower electron densities adjacent to the CM and OM, respectively. Flagellar filaments were observed overlying the PG layer, while image modeling placed the PG-basal body contact site in the vicinity of the stator-P-collar junction. Bioinformatics and homology modeling indicated that the MotB proteins of T. pallidum, Treponema denticola, and Borrelia burgdorferi have membrane topologies and PG binding sites highly similar to those of their well-characterized Escherichia coli and Helicobacter pylori orthologs. Collectively, our results help to clarify fundamental differences in cell envelope ultrastructure between spirochetes and gram-negative bacteria. They also confirm that PG stabilizes the flagellar motor and enable us to propose that in most spirochetes motility results from rotation of the flagellar filaments against the PG.
TI  - Role of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in glutathione catabolism.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Our previous studies demonstrated that three enzymes, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), cysteinylglycinase (CGase) and cystalysin, are required for the catabolism of glutathione to produce hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) in Treponema denticola. In this study, we examined glutathione catabolism in Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. METHODS: The GGT and CGase of A. actinomycetemcomitans were determined by biological methods and GGT was characterized using a molecular biological approach. RESULTS: A. actinomycetemcomitans showed GGT and CGase activity, but could not produce H(2)S from glutathione. The addition of recombinant T. denticola cystalysin, an l-cysteine desulfhydrase, to whole cells of A. actinomycetemcomitans resulted in the production of H(2)S from glutathione. Subsequently, we cloned A. actinomycetemcomitans GGT gene (ggt) and overexpressed the 63 kDa GGT protein. The recombinant A. actinomycetemcomitans GGT was purified and identified. The K(cat)/K(m) of the recombinant GGT from N-gamma-l-glutamyl-4-nitroaniline as substrate was 31/microm/min. The activity of GGT was optimum at pH 6.9-7.1 and enhanced by thiol-containing compounds. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that A. actinomycetemcomitans had GGT and CGase activities and that the GGT was characterized. The possible role of A. actinomycetemcomitans in glutathione metabolism and H(2)S production from oral bacteria was discussed.
TI  - Treponema denticola TroR is a manganese- and iron-dependent transcriptional repressor.
AB  - Treponema denticola harbours a genetic locus with significant homology to most of the previously characterized Treponema pallidum tro operon. Within this locus are five genes (troABCDR) encoding for the components of an ATP-binding cassette cation-transport system (troABCD) and a DtxR-like transcriptional regulator (troR). In addition, a sigma(70)-like promoter and an 18 bp region of dyad symmetry were identified upstream of the troA start codon. This putative operator sequence demonstrated similarity to the T. pallidum TroR (TroR(Tp)) binding sequence; however, the position of this motif with respect to the predicted tro promoters differed. Interestingly, unlike the T. pallidum orthologue, T. denticola TroR (TroR(Td)) possesses a C-terminal Src homology 3-like domain commonly associated with DtxR family members. In the present study, we show that TroR(Td) is a manganese- and iron-dependent transcriptional repressor using Escherichia coli reporter constructs and in T. denticola. In addition, we demonstrate that although TroR(Td) possessing various C-terminal deletions maintain metal-sensing capacities, these truncated proteins exhibit reduced repressor activities in comparison with full-length TroR(Td). Based upon these findings, we propose that TroR(Td) represents a novel member of the DtxR family of transcriptional regulators and is likely to play an important role in regulating both manganese and iron homeostases in this spirochaete.
TI  - An engineered folded PLP-bound monomer of Treponema denticola cystalysin reveals  the effect of the dimeric structure on the catalytic properties of the enzyme.
AB  - Cystalysin, a dimeric pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent lyase, is a virulence factor of the human oral pathogen Treponema denticola. Guided by bioinformatic analysis, two interfacial residues (Leu57 and Leu62) and an active site residue (Tyr64*), hydrogen-bonded with the PLP phosphate group of the neighboring subunit, have been mutated. The wild-type and the L57A, L62A, Y64*A, L57A/L62A, L57A/Y64*A, L57A/L62A/Y64*A mutants, all having a C-terminal histidine tag, have been constructed, expressed, and purified. The impact of these mutations on the dimeric state of cystalysin in the apo- and holo-form has been analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography. The results demonstrate that (i) Leu57 is more critical than Leu62 for apodimer formation, (ii) Tyr64*, more than Leu62, interferes with dimerization of holocystalysin without affecting that of apoenzyme, (iii) while each single mutation is inadequate in significantly altering the extent of monomerization of both apo- and holo-cystalysin, their combination leads to species which remain in a folded monomeric state at a reasonably high concentration in both the apo- and holo-forms. Although L57A/L62A or L57A/Y64*A, even to a different extent, are stimulated to dimer formation in the presence of either unproductive or productive ligands, L57A/L62A/Y64*A remains prevalently monomer at a concentration up to 50 microM. Kinetic analyses show that in this monomeric species the alpha,beta-eliminase, alanine racemase, and D-alanine half-transaminase activities are almost abolished, while the L-alanine half-transaminase activity is slightly enhanced when compared with that of wild-type. The structural basis of the stereospecific transaminase activity displayed by the engineered folded PLP-bound monomer has been analyzed and discussed.
TI  - A 52-kDa leucyl aminopeptidase from treponema denticola is a cysteinylglycinase that mediates the second step of glutathione metabolism.
AB  - The metabolism of glutathione by the periodontal pathogen Treponema denticola produces hydrogen sulfide, which may play a role in the host tissue destruction seen in periodontitis. H2S production in this organism has been proposed to occur via a three enzyme pathway, gamma-glutamyltransferase, cysteinylglycinase (CGase), and cystalysin. In this study, we describe the purification and characterization of T. denticola CGase. Standard approaches were used to purify a 52-kDa CGase activity from T. denticola, and high pressure liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry analysis of this molecule showed that it matches the amino acid sequence of a predicted 52-kDa protein in the T. denticola genome data base. A recombinant version of this protein was overexpressed in and purified from Escherichia coli and shown to catalyze the hydrolysis of cysteinylglycine (Cys-Gly) with the same kinetics as the native protein. Surprisingly, because sequence homology indicates that this protein is a member of a family of metalloproteases called M17 leucine aminopeptidases, the preferred substrate for the T. denticola protein is Cys-Gly (k cat/Km of 8.2 microm(-1) min(-1)) not l-Leu-p-NA (k cat/Km of 1.1 microm(-1) min(-1)). The activity of CGase for Cys-Gly is optimum at pH 7.3 and is enhanced by Mn2+, Co2+, or Mg2+ but not by Zn2+ or Ca2+. Importantly, in combination with the two other previously purified T. denticola enzymes, gamma-glutamyltransferase and cystalysin, CGase mediates the in vitro degradation of glutathione into the expected end products, including H2S. These results prove that T. denticola contains the entire three-step pathway to produce H2S from glutathione, which may be important for pathogenesis.
TI  - Highly conserved surface proteins of oral spirochetes as adhesins and potent inducers of proinflammatory and osteoclastogenic factors.
AB  - Oral spirochetes include enormously heterogeneous Treponema species, and some have been implicated in the etiology of periodontitis. In this study, we characterized highly conserved surface proteins in four representative oral spirochetes (Treponema denticola, T. lecithinolyticum, T. maltophilum, and T. socranskii subsp. socranskii) that are homologs of T. pallidum Tp92, with opsonophagocytic potential and protective capacity against syphilis. Tp92 homologs of oral spirochetes had predicted signal peptides (20 to 31 amino acids) and molecular masses of 88 to 92 kDa for mature proteins. They showed amino acid sequence identities of 37.9 to 49.3% and similarities of 54.5 to 66.9% to Tp92. The sequence identities and similarities of Tp92 homologs of oral treponemes to one another were 41.6 to 71.6% and 59.9 to 85.6%, respectively. The tp92 gene homologs were successfully expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant proteins were capable of binding to KB cells, an epithelial cell line, and inhibited the binding of the whole bacteria to the cells. Antiserum (the immunoglobulin G fraction) raised against a recombinant form of the T. denticola Tp92 homolog cross-reacted with homologs from three other species of treponemes. The Tp92 homologs stimulated various factors involved in inflammation and osteoclastogenesis, like interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-6, prostaglandin E(2), and matrix metalloproteinase 9, in host cells like monocytes and fibroblasts. Our results demonstrate that Tp92 homologs of oral spirochetes are highly conserved and may play an important role in cell attachment, inflammation, and tissue destruction. The coexistence of various Treponema species in a single periodontal pocket and, therefore, the accumulation of multiple Tp92 homologs may amplify the pathological effect in periodontitis.
TI  - Human serum antibodies recognize Treponema denticola Msp and PrtP protease complex proteins.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Treponema denticola outer membrane proteins are postulated to have key roles in microbe-host interactions in periodontitis. Because there are no reports of in vivo expression of these putative virulence factors, we examined several T. denticola strains to determine whether sera from human subjects recognized specific T. denticola outer membrane proteins. METHODS: Soluble extracts were prepared from exponential phase cultures of T. denticola strains representing three serotypes, from defined T. denticola mutants defective in Msp (major surface protein) or PrtP lipoprotein protease complex (CTLP; dentilisin), and Escherichia coli strains expressing distinctly different T. denticola Msp. Extracts were subjected to Western immunoassays using archived human serum samples. RESULTS: Human serum antibodies (immunoglobulin G class) recognized multiple protein bands in T. denticola strains. In the parent strain ATCC 35405, these included bands at 72-, 53-, 40-, and 30-kDa. Bands corresponding to Msp and the PrtP protease complex proteins were absent in isogenic msp and protease complex mutants, respectively. Individual human sera showed specificity for one or more Msp types. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first definitive report of human serum antibody responses to specific T. denticola antigens. T. denticola Msp and the proteins comprising the PrtP lipoprotein protease complex are expressed in vivo and are immunogenic in humans. Human antibody recognition of Msp exhibits strain specificity and is consistent with strain serotyping. These results demonstrate the utility of T. denticola isogenic mutants in characterizing host immune responses to periodontal pathogens.
TI  - Factors and selenocysteine insertion sequence requirements for the synthesis of selenoproteins from a gram-positive anaerobe in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Selenoprotein synthesis in Escherichia coli strictly depends on the presence of a specific selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) following the selenocysteine-encoding UGA codon of the respective mRNA. It is recognized by the selenocysteine-specific elongation factor SelB, leading to cotranslational insertion of selenocysteine into the nascent polypeptide chain. The synthesis of three different selenoproteins from the gram-positive anaerobe Eubacterium acidaminophilum in E. coli was studied. Incorporation of (75)Se into glycine reductase protein B (GrdB1), the peroxiredoxin PrxU, and selenophosphate synthetase (SelD1) was negligible in an E. coli wild-type strain and was fully absent in an E. coli SelB mutant. Selenoprotein synthesis, however, was strongly increased if selB and selC (tRNA(Sec)) from E. acidaminophilum were coexpressed. Putative secondary structures downstream of the UGA codons did not show any sequence similarity to each other or to the E. coli SECIS element. However, mutations in these structures strongly reduced the amount of (75)Se-labeled protein, indicating that they indeed act as SECIS elements. UGA readthrough mediated by the three different SECIS elements was further analyzed using gst-lacZ translational fusions. In the presence of selB and selC from E. acidaminophilum, UGA readthrough was 36 to 64% compared to the respective cysteine-encoding UGC variant. UGA readthrough of SECIS elements present in Desulfomicrobium baculatum (hydV), Treponema denticola (selD), and Campylobacter jejuni (selW-like gene) was also considerably enhanced in the presence of E. acidaminophilum selB and selC. This indicates recognition of these SECIS elements and might open new perspectives for heterologous selenoprotein synthesis in E. coli.
TI  - Characterization of Treponema denticola pyrF encoding orotidine-5'-monophosphate  decarboxylase.
AB  - The Treponema denticola ATCC 35405 genome annotation contains most of the genes for de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. To initiate characterization of pyrimidine synthesis in Treponema, we focused on TDE2110 (the putative pyrF, encoding orotidine-5'-monophosphate decarboxlyase). Unlike the parent strain, an isogenic pyrF mutant was resistant to 5-fluoroorotic acid. In complex medium, growth of the pyrF mutant was independent of added uracil, indicating activity of a uracil uptake/salvage pathway. Transcription of pyrF was greatly reduced in T. denticola grown in excess uracil, demonstrating that de novo pyrimidine synthesis is regulated and suggesting a feedback mechanism. Treponema denticola PyrF complemented uracil auxotrophy in an Escherichia coli pyrF mutant. This study provides biochemical confirmation of T. denticola genome predictions of de novo and salvage pyrimidine pathways and provides proof of concept that pyrF has potential as a selectable marker in T. denticola.
TI  - Anti-inflammatory activity of a high-molecular-weight cranberry fraction on macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathogens.
AB  - Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting oral tissues. The continuous, high production of cytokines by host cells triggered by periodontopathogens is thought to be responsible for the destruction of tooth-supporting tissues. Macrophages play a critical role in this host inflammatory response to periodontopathogens. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of non-dialyzable material prepared from cranberry juice concentrate on the pro-inflammatory cytokine response of macrophages induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, and Escherichia coli. Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and Regulated on Activation Normal T-cell Expressed and Secreted (RANTES) production by macrophages treated with the cranberry fraction prior to stimulation by LPS was evaluated by ELISA. Our results clearly indicate that the cranberry fraction was a potent inhibitor of the pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses induced by LPS. This suggests that cranberry constituents may offer perspectives for the development of a new therapeutic approach to the prevention and treatment of periodontitis.
TI  - Binding properties and adhesion-mediating regions of the major sheath protein of  Treponema denticola ATCC 35405.
AB  - There is growing evidence that a number of oral Treponema species, in particular  Treponema denticola, are associated with the progression of human periodontal disease. The major sheath (or surface) protein (Msp) of T. denticola is implicated in adhesion of bacteria to host cells and tissue proteins and is likely to be an important virulence factor. However, the binding regions of the Msp are not known. We have purified from Escherichia coli recombinant Msp (rMsp) polypeptides corresponding to the following: full-length Msp (rMsp) minus 13 N-terminal amino acid (aa) residues, an amino-terminal fragment (rN-Msp, 189 aa residues), a 57-aa residue segment from the central region (rV-Msp), and a C-terminal fragment (rC-Msp, 272 aa residues). rMsp (530 aa residues) bound to immobilized fibronectin, keratin, laminin, collagen type I, fibrinogen, hyaluronic acid, and heparin. The N- and V-region polypeptides, but not rC-Msp, also bound to these substrates. Binding of rMsp to fibronectin was targeted to the N-terminal heparin I/fibrin I domain. Antibodies to the N-region or V-region polypeptides, but not antibodies to the rC-Msp fragment, blocked adhesion of T. denticola ATCC 35405 cells to a range of host protein molecules. These results suggest that the N-terminal half of Msp carries epitopes that are surface exposed and that are involved in mediating adhesion. Binding of rMsp onto the cell surface of low-level fibronectin-binding Treponema isolates conferred a 10-fold increase in fibronectin binding. This confirms that Msp functions autonomously as an adhesin and raises the possibility that phenotypic complementation of virulence functions might occur within mixed populations of Treponema species.
TI  - Biochemical characterization of phosphoryl transfer involving HPr of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system in Treponema denticola, an organism that lacks PTS permeases.
AB  - Treponema pallidum and Treponema denticola encode within their genomes homologues of energy coupling and regulatory proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) but no recognizable homologues of PTS permeases. These homologues include (1) Enzyme I, (2) HPr, (3) two IIA(Ntr)-like proteins, and (4) HPr(Ser) kinase/phosphorylase (HprK). Because the Enzyme I-encoding gene in T. pallidum is an inactive pseudogene and because all other pts genes in both T. pallidum and T. denticola are actively expressed, the primary sensory transduction mechanism for signal detection and transmission appears to involve HprK rather than EI. We have overexpressed and purified to near homogeneity four of the five PTS proteins from T. denticola. Purified HprK phosphorylates HPr with ATP, probably on serine, while Enzyme I phosphorylates HPr with PEP, probably on histidine. Furthermore, HPr(His)-P can transfer its phosphoryl group to IIA(Ntr)-1. Factors and conditions regulating phosphoryl transfer prove to differ from those described previously for Bacillus subtilis, but cross-enzymatic activities between the Treponema, Salmonella, and Bacillus phosphoryl-transfer systems could be demonstrated. Kinetic analyses revealed that the allosterically regulated HPr kinase/phosphorylase differs from its homologues in Bacillus subtilis and other low G+C Gram-positive bacteria in being primed for kinase activity rather than phosphorylase activity in the absence of allosteric effectors. The characteristics of this enzyme and the Treponema phosphoryl-transfer chain imply unique modes of signal detection and sensory transmission. This paper provides the first biochemical description of PTS phosphoryl-transfer chains in an organism that lacks PTS permeases.
TI  - Resistance to human beta-defensins is common among oral treponemes.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Oral treponemes are implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. We have previously shown that Treponema denticola ATCC type strains and strain GM-1 are resistant to killing by human beta-defensins (hbetaD)-1 and -2. We hypothesize that resistance to beta-defensins is a common feature of oral treponemes, which allows colonization and persistence in the oral cavity. In this study, we tested additional isolates of T. denticola, as well as six other species of treponemes, for resistance to hbetaD-1, -2 and -3. We also examined the four ATCC strains of T. denticola and strain GM-1 for resistance to hbetaD-3. METHODS: Resistance was determined by motility and Alamar Blue assays for metabolic activity. RESULTS: All T. denticola strains tested were resistant to hbetaD-1, -2 and -3, with the exception of strain Ambigua, which was sensitive to hbetaD-2 and -3. All other treponemes except Treponema vincentii were resistant to hbetaD-1. Treponema pectinovorum was sensitive to hbetaD-2, while T. vincentii, T. pectinovorum and Treponema maltophilum were sensitive to hbetaD-3. Escherichia coli was used as a control organism and was killed by all three defensins. CONCLUSION: Resistance to the constitutively expressed hbetaD-1 may assist treponemes in initial colonization of epithelial surfaces, while resistance to the inducible hbetaD-2 and -3 would allow some treponemes to survive in active periodontal lesions.
TI  - Implant therapy following liver transplantation: clinical and microbiological results after 10 years.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of immunocompromised patients is increasing as a consequence of successful organ transplantation. Placing dental implants in these patients has been questioned because of their increased risk for infections. The 10-year follow-up data of a 71-year-old liver transplant recipient with long-term immunosuppressive therapy is reported. Six months after liver transplantation, two interforaminal implants were inserted in the edentulous mandible, and an overdenture using non-rigid telescopic attachments was fabricated 3 months later. METHODS: Oral clinical parameters included the modified plaque index, sulcus fluid flow rate, modified bleeding index, probing depth, distance implant mucosa, attachment level, width of the keratinized mucosa and mobility values. The distance implant bone (DIB) was determined on digital panoramic radiographs. The levels of eight periodontal marker organisms were established using DNA probe technology. Additionally, swabs of the edentulous oral mucosa were taken for microbiological culture and antimicrobial resistance testing. RESULTS: The peri-implant parameters were within normal ranges indicating a stable osseointegration with moderate vertical bone loss. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Tannerella forsythensis, Campylobacter rectus, and Treponema denticola were not detected. Low levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Eikenella corrodens were found. Prevotella intermedia was the only bacterium with a level higher than 10(4). The mucosal swabs indicated the presence of an abundant normal oral flora, including Escherichia coli and Candida albicans. The antibiogram revealed multiple resistance to antibiotics. CONCLUSION: This case report suggests that immunocompromised patients can be successfully rehabilitated with dental implants.
TI  - Site-directed mutagenesis provides insight into racemization and transamination of alanine catalyzed by Treponema denticola cystalysin.
AB  - In addition to alpha, beta-elimination of L-cysteine, Treponema denticola cystalysin catalyzes the racemization of both enantiomers of alanine accompanied by an overall transamination. Lys-238 and Tyr-123 or a water molecule located on the si and re face of the cofactor, respectively, have been proposed to act as the acid/base catalysts in the proton abstraction/donation at Calpha/C4' of the external aldimine. In this investigation, two site-directed mutants, K238A and Y123F, have been characterized. The Lys --> Ala mutation results in the complete loss of either lyase activity or racemase activity in both directions or transaminase activity toward L-alanine. However, the K238A mutant is able to catalyze the overall transamination of D-alanine, and only D-alanine is the product of the reverse transamination. For Y123F the k(cat)/K(m) is reduced 3.5-fold for alpha, beta-elimination, whereas it is reduced 300-400-fold for racemization. Y123F has approximately 18% of wild type transaminase activity with L-alanine and an extremely low transaminase activity with D-alanine. Moreover, the catalytic properties of the Y124F and Y123F/Y124F mutants rule out the possibility that the residual racemase and transaminase activities displayed by Y123F are due to Tyr-124. All these data, together with computational results, indicate a two-base racemization mechanism for cystalysin in which Lys-238 has been unequivocally identified as the catalyst acting on the si face of the cofactor. Moreover, this study highlights the importance of the interaction of Tyr-123 with water molecules for efficient proton abstraction/donation function on the re face.
TI  - Expression of Treponema denticola oligopeptidase B in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Treponema denticola is a small anaerobic spirochete often isolated from periodontal lesions and closely associated with periodontal diseases. This bacterium possesses a particular arginine peptidase activity (previously called "BANA-peptidase" or "trypsin-like enzyme") that is common to the three cultivable bacterial species most highly associated with severe periodontal disease. We recently reported the identification of the opdB locus that encodes the BANA-peptidase activity of T. denticola through DNA sequencing and mutagenesis studies. In the present study, we report expression of T. denticola OpdB peptidase in Escherichia coli. The opdB PCR product was cloned into pET30b and then transformed into the E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pLysS expression strain. Assays of enzymatic activities in E. coli containing T. denticola opdB showed BANA-peptidase activity similar to that of T. denticola. Availability of this recombinant expression system producing active peptidase will facilitate characterization of the potential role of this peptidase in periodontal disease etiology.
TI  - Treponema denticola cystalysin exhibits significant alanine racemase activity accompanied by transamination: mechanistic implications.
AB  - To obtain information on the reaction specificity of cystalysin from the spirochaete bacterium Treponema denticola, the interaction with L- and D-alanine has been investigated. Binding of both alanine enantiomers leads to the appearance of an external aldimine absorbing at 429 nm and of a band absorbing at 498 nm, indicative of a quinonoid species. Racemization and transamination reactions were observed to occur with both alanine isomers as substrates. The steady-state kinetic parameters for racemization, k (cat) and K (m), for L-alanine are 1.05+/-0.03 s(-1) and 10+/-1 mM respectively, whereas those for D-alanine are 1.4+/-0.1 s(-1) and 10+/-1 mM. During the reaction of cystalysin with L- or D-alanine, a time-dependent loss of beta-elimination activity occurs concomitantly with the conversion of the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) coenzyme into pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (PMP). The catalytic efficiency of the half-transamination of L-alanine is found to be 5.3x10(-5) mM(-1) x s(-1), 5-fold higher when compared with that of D-alanine. The partition ratio between racemization and half-transamination reactions is 2.3x10(3) for L-alanine and 1.4x10(4) for D-alanine. The pH dependence of the kinetic parameters for both the reactions shows that the enzyme possesses a single ionizing residue with p K values of 6.5-6.6, which must be unprotonated for catalysis. Addition of pyruvate converts the PMP form of the enzyme back into the PLP form and causes the concomitant recovery of beta-elimination activity. In contrast with other PLP enzymes studied so far, but similar to alanine racemases, the apoform of the enzyme abstracted tritium from C4' of both (4' S)- and (4' R)-[4'-(3)H]PMP in the presence of pyruvate. Together with molecular modelling of the putative binding sites of L- and D-alanine at the active site of the enzyme, the implications of these studies for the mechanisms of the side reactions catalysed by cystalysin are discussed.
TI  - Role for recombinant gamma-glutamyltransferase from Treponema denticola in glutathione metabolism.
AB  - Volatile sulfur compounds, including hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), have been implicated in the development of periodontal disease. Glutathione is an important thiol source for H(2)S production in periodontal pockets. Our recent studies have delineated a pathway of glutathione metabolism in Treponema denticola that releases H(2)S. In this pathway, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) has been proposed to catalyze the first step of glutathione degradation. We have cloned the gene of GGT from T. denticola, which contains an open reading frame of 726 bp encoding a protein of 241 amino acids. Transformation of this gene into Escherichia coli led to the expression of a recombinant protein. After purification by chromatography, the recombinant protein showed enzymatic activity typical of GGT, catalyzing the degradation of Na-gamma-glutamyl-4-nitroaniline (GNA) and the hydrolysis of glutathione, releasing glutamic acid or glutamine and cysteinylglycine. L-Cysteine is not a substrate of GGT. Importantly, GNA, when added to T. denticola, was able to compete with glutathione and inhibit the production of H(2)S, ammonia, and pyruvate. This was accompanied by the suppression of hemoxidative and hemolytic activities of the bacteria. Purified GGT was inactivated by TLCK (Nalpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone) and proteinase K treatment. However, higher enzymatic activity was demonstrated in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol. Our further experiments showed that the addition of recombinant GGT to Porphyromonas gingivalis, a bacterium without significant glutathione-metabolizing capacity, drastically increased the utilization of glutathione by the bacterium, producing H(2)S, ammonia, and pyruvate. This was again accompanied by enhanced bacterial hemoxidative and hemolytic activities. Together, the results suggest an important role for GGT in glutathione metabolism in oral bacteria.
TI  - Construction and analysis of hemin binding protein mutants in the oral pathogen Treponema denticola.
AB  - Treponema denticola, a periodontal pathogen, can use hemin as its sole iron source. The organism synthesizes two low-iron-induced outer-membrane hemin-binding proteins, HbpA and HbpB. To characterize genetically the function of these two novel proteins, standard recombinant DNA procedures and electroporation were used to construct T. denticola strains in which the genomic copies of either hbpA or both hbpA and hbpB were interrupted with an erythromycin resistance cassette. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses verified that the normal hbpA transcripts were missing in both mutants. The hbpA mutation also had a polar effect on the transcription of hbpB and thus neither mutant strain transcribes the downstream hbpB gene. The parental and hbp mutant strains had similar growth properties in normal media, but the mutants reached a lower cell density than parental cells in iron-restricted media. The results indicate that HbpA and/or HbpB are required for efficient iron utilization but that there is an additional system that can help T. denticola acquire iron. The growth defect of the mutants was totally restored by lactoferrin but only partially restored by adding exogenous hemin or inorganic iron. Thus, hbpA and/or hbpB specifically facilitate hemin and iron utilization under low iron conditions and are presumably important for T. denticola virulence in the host environment.
TI  - Cleavage of Treponema denticola PrcA polypeptide to yield protease complex-associated proteins Prca1 and Prca2 is dependent on PrtP.
AB  - Analysis of potential virulence factors of oral spirochetes focuses on surface and secreted proteins. The Treponema denticola chymotrypsin-like protease (CTLP) is implicated in degradation of host cell molecules and contributes to tissue invasion. The CTLP complex, composed of the 72-kDa PrtP protein and two auxiliary proteins with molecular masses of approximately 40 and 30 kDa, is also involved in localization and oligomerization of the T. denticola major surface protein (Msp). The larger auxiliary protein was reported to be encoded by an open reading frame (ORF2) directly upstream of prtP. The deduced 39-kDa translation product of ORF2 contains a sequence matching the N-terminal sequence determined from one of the CTLP complex proteins. No proteins with significant homology are known, nor was information available on the third protein of the complex. DNA sequence analysis showed that ORF2 extended an additional 852 bp upstream of the reported sequence. The complete gene, designated prcA, encodes a predicted N-terminally-acylated polypeptide of approximately 70 kDa. Isogenic mutants with mutations in prtP, prcA, and prcA-prtP all lacked CTLP protease activity. The prcA mutant lacked all three CTLP proteins. The prcA-prtP mutant produced only a C-terminally-truncated 62-kDa PrcA protein. The prtP mutant produced a full-length 70-kDa PrcA. Immunoblot analysis of recombinant PrcA constructs confirmed that PrcA is cleaved to yield the two smaller proteins of the CTLP complex, designated PrcA1 and PrcA2. These data indicate that PrtP is required for cleavage of PrcA and suggest that this cleavage may be required for formation or stability of outer membrane complexes.
TI  - Genetic exchange between Treponema denticola and Streptococcus gordonii in biofilms.
AB  - Some gram-positive oral bacteria such as Streptococcus gordonii are naturally transformable. We investigated the possibility of genetic exchange among oral bacteria using an erythromycin-resistant (Erm(r)) shuttle plasmid, pKMR4PE, as an indicator. S. gordonii Challis cells were co-cultivated with purified pKMR4PE or with Trepomena denticola harboring pKMR4PE either in broth or in artificial biofilms. Transformation of S. gordonii occurred both in broth and in biofilms with pKMR4PE or T. denticola harboring pKMR4PE as donor sources. These results provide direct experimental evidence that gene transfer can occur from T. denticola to S. gordonii.
TI  - Complementation of a Treponema denticola flgE mutant with a novel coumermycin A1-resistant T. denticola shuttle vector system.
AB  - By using the mutated gyrB gene from a spontaneous coumermycin A1-resistant Treponema denticola, an Escherichia coli-T. denticola shuttle vector that renders T. denticola resistant to coumermycin was constructed. The complete T. denticola flgE gene was cloned into the shuttle vector pKMCou, and the vector was transformed into the T. denticola ATCC 33520 flgE erythromycin-resistant knockout mutant HL210. The coumermycin-resistant transformants were motile and restored FlgE activity. This complementation system should prove useful in studying the virulence factors of T. denticola and uncultivatible pathogenic spirochetes.
TI  - 23S rRNA point mutation associated with erythromycin resistance in Treponema denticola.
AB  - Mechanisms and occurrence of macrolide resistance in the periodontal pathogen Treponema denticola have received little attention. In this study, erythromycin resistance due to mutations in the genes encoding T. denticola 23S rRNA was investigated. The T. denticola genome was shown to contain two copies of 23S rDNA. 23S rRNA genes of nine erythromycin-resistant isolates derived from T. denticola were amplified and sequences were analyzed. All the erythromycin-resistant strains had at least one A-->G transition mutation at the 23S rRNA gene sequence cognate to position A2058 in Escherichia coli 23S rDNA. This suggests that antibiotic pressure is sufficient to select for point mutations that confer resistance in this organism.
TI  - Aerobic sulfide production and cadmium precipitation by Escherichia coli expressing the Treponema denticola cysteine desulfhydrase gene.
AB  - The cysteine desulfhydrase gene of Treponema denticola was over-expressed in Escherichia coli to produce sulfide under aerobic conditions and to precipitate metal sulfide complexes on the cell wall. When grown in a defined salts medium supplemented with cadmium and cysteine, E. coli producing cysteine desulfhydrase secreted sulfide and removed nearly all of the cadmium from solution after 48 h. A control strain produced significantly less sulfide and removed significantly less cadmium. Measurement of acid-labile sulfide and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy indicated that cadmium was precipitated as cadmium sulfide. Without supplemental cysteine, both the E. coli producing cysteine desulfhydrase and the control E. coli demonstrated minimal cadmium removal.
TI  - Cloning and expression of two novel hemin binding protein genes from Treponema denticola.
AB  - Treponema denticola does not appear to produce siderophores, so it must acquire iron by other pathways. Indeed, T. denticola has been shown to have an iron-regulated 44-kDa outer membrane protein (HbpA) with hemin binding ability. To characterize the HbpA protein, its gene was cloned from genomic DNA libraries of T. denticola. Sequence analysis of the hbpA open reading frame indicated that it encoded a 42.8-kDa protein with a 23-amino-acid signal peptide. HbpA has no significant homology to any proteins in the databases. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that hbpA is present in several T. denticola ATCC strains and clinical isolates, but not in Treponema pectinovorum, Treponema socranskii, or Escherichia coli. HbpA, expressed as a recombinant protein in E. coli and purified by antibody affinity chromatography, has hemin binding activity as determined by lithium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with tetramethylbenzidine staining. Northern blot analysis showed that there were two hbpA-containing transcripts, of approximately 1.3 and 2.6 kb, and that the RNA levels were low-iron induced. Interestingly, the 2.6-kb mRNA also encoded a second protein with significant homology to hbpA. This downstream gene, called hbpB, was cloned and sequenced and its product was expressed as a fusion protein in E. coli. The hbpB gene product is 49% identical to HbpA and binds hemin. Thus, T. denticola has two novel hemin binding proteins which may be part of a previously unrecognized iron acquisition pathway.
TI  - Bacterial diversity in human subgingival plaque.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the bacterial diversity in the human subgingival plaque by using culture-independent molecular methods as part of an ongoing effort to obtain full 16S rRNA sequences for all cultivable and not-yet-cultivated species of human oral bacteria. Subgingival plaque was analyzed from healthy subjects and subjects with refractory periodontitis, adult periodontitis, human immunodeficiency virus periodontitis, and acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis. 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) bacterial genes from DNA isolated from subgingival plaque samples were PCR amplified with all-bacterial or selective primers and cloned into Escherichia coli. The sequences of cloned 16S rDNA inserts were used to determine species identity or closest relatives by comparison with sequences of known species. A total of 2,522 clones were analyzed. Nearly complete sequences of approximately 1,500 bases were obtained for putative new species. About 60% of the clones fell into 132 known species, 70 of which were identified from multiple subjects. About 40% of the clones were novel phylotypes. Of the 215 novel phylotypes, 75 were identified from multiple subjects. Known putative periodontal pathogens such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, and Treponema denticola were identified from multiple subjects, but typically as a minor component of the plaque as seen in cultivable studies. Several phylotypes fell into two recently described phyla previously associated with extreme natural environments, for which there are no cultivable species. A number of species or phylotypes were found only in subjects with disease, and a few were found only in healthy subjects. The organisms identified only from diseased sites deserve further study as potential pathogens. Based on the sequence data in this study, the predominant subgingival microbial community consisted of 347 species or phylotypes that fall into 9 bacterial phyla. Based on the 347 species seen in our sample of 2,522 clones, we estimate that there are 68 additional unseen species, for a total estimate of 415 species in the subgingival plaque. When organisms found on other oral surfaces such as the cheek, tongue, and teeth are added to this number, the best estimate of the total species diversity in the oral cavity is approximately 500 species, as previously proposed.
TI  - The TprK protein of Treponema pallidum is periplasmic and is not a target of opsonic antibody or protective immunity.
AB  - The finding that Treponema pallidum, the syphilis spirochete, contains 12 orthologs of the Treponema denticola outer membrane major sheath protein has engendered speculation that members of this T. pallidum repeat (Tpr) family may be similarly surface exposed. In this regard, the TprK protein was reported to be a target of opsonic antibody and protective immunity and subject to immunologically driven sequence variation. Despite these findings, results from our previous analyses of treponemal outer membranes in concert with computer-based predictions for TprK prompted us to examine the cellular location of this protein. TprK-alkaline phosphatase fusions expressed in Escherichia coli demonstrate that TprK contains a signal peptide. However, opsonophagocytosis assays failed to indicate surface exposure of TprK. Moreover, results from three independent methodologies, i.e., (a) indirect immunofluorescence analysis of agarose-encapsulated organisms, (b) proteinase K treatment of intact spirochetes, and (c) Triton X-114 phase partitioning of T. pallidum conclusively demonstrated that native TprK is entirely periplasmic. Consistent with this location, immunization with the recombinant protein failed to induce either protective immunity or select for TprK variants in the rabbit model of experimental syphilis. These findings challenge the notion that TprK will be a component of an efficacious syphilis vaccine.
TI  - Development of shuttle vectors for spirochetes.
AB  - Constructions of Escherichia coli-spirochete shuttle vectors are based on naturally occurring plasmids, broad host range plasmids or bacteriophages. This review primarily focuses on genetic tools for Treponema denticola which is associated with periodontal diseases. The T. pallidum FlaA protein, E. coli beta-galactosidase, and the green fluorescent protein were successfully expressed in T. denticola from a shuttle vector system.
TI  - Identification of a Treponema denticola OppA homologue that binds host proteins present in the subgingival environment.
AB  - Proteins secreted or exported by Treponema denticola have been implicated as mediators of specific interactions between the spirochete and subgingival tissues in periodontal diseases. However, limited information is available on the ability of this peptidolytic organism to bind or transport soluble peptides present in the subgingival environment. A prominent 70-kDa protein was isolated from surface extracts of T. denticola ATCC 35405. A clone expressing a portion of the protein was identified in an Escherichia coli expression library of T. denticola DNA. DNA sequence analysis showed that the cloned gene encoded a peptide homologous to OppA, the solute binding protein of an ATP-binding cassette-type peptide transporter involved in peptide uptake and environmental signaling in a wide range of bacteria. Genes encoding OppB, -C, -D, and -F were identified directly downstream of oppA in T. denticola. OppA was present in representative strains of T. denticola and in Treponema vincentii but was not detected in Treponema pectinovorum or Treponema socranskii. Immunogold electron microscopy suggested that OppA was accessible to proteins at the surface of the spirochete. Native OppA bound soluble plasminogen and fibronectin but did not bind to immobilized substrates or epithelial cells. A T. denticola oppA mutant bound reduced amounts of soluble plasminogen, and plasminogen binding to the parent strain was inhibited by the lysine analog epsilon-aminocaproic acid. Binding of soluble host proteins by OppA may be important both for spirochete-host interactions in the subgingival environment and for uptake of peptide nutrients.
TI  - Epithelial cell response to challenge of bacterial lipoteichoic acids and lipopolysaccharides in vitro.
AB  - Accumulating dental plaque at the gingival margin contains lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) from the cell walls of gram-positive bacteria. In subgingival plaque associated with periodontal disease the amount of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) from gram-negative bacteria increases. As the gingival junctional epithelium (JE) is an important structural and functional tissue, participating in the first line defence against apical advancement of dental plaque, this study examined the direct effects of LTAs (from Streptococcus mutans and S. sanguis) and LPSs (from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola and Escherichia coli) on two epithelial cell lines (HaCaT and ERM) and a culture model for human JE. The cells were exposed to the LTAs or LPSs (10-50 microg/ml) for variable periods of time. None of the bacterial surface components had any effect on primary adhesion or on the epithelial attachment of the JE cultures. However, cell growth and mitotic activity were consistently reduced in all cultures treated with LTAs. In contrast, LPSs showed only slight or no effects on cell growth and mitotic activity depending on the epithelial cells used. This suggests that LPSs, despite their established role as modulators of inflammation, do not have direct harmful effects - at the concentrations found in dental plaque and gingival crevicular fluid - which would explain the mechanism of epithelial degeneration and detachment from the tooth surface. However, the LTAs appear to inhibit the renewal of epithelium and may thus contribute to degeneration of coronal JE and subgingival colonisation by periodontal pathogens.
TI  - Molecular characterization of a flagellar (fla) operon in the oral spirochete Treponema denticola ATCC 35405.
AB  - A Treponema denticola 9.6-kb motility locus containing 11 genes was identified, sequenced and analyzed. The genes were designated tap1, flgD, flgE, orf4, motA, motB, fliL, fliM, fliY, orf10 and fliP. The order of these genes is identical to that of the corresponding region of the Treponema pallidum fla operon. Seven of the deduced Fla proteins share significant homology with both Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis proteins associated with flagellar structure and function. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis indicated that the T. denticola fla genes are transcribed as a single unit. A putative sigma(28)-like promoter, virtually identical to the T. pallidum fla promoter, was identified upstream of tap1. These results showed that the T. denticola and T. pallidum fla operons are highly conserved, supporting the proposed phylogenetic relatedness of these spirochetes.
TI  - Development of a system for expressing heterologous genes in the oral spirochete  Treponema denticola and its use in expression of the Treponema pallidum flaA gene.
AB  - The present communication describes the construction of a new Escherichia coli-Treponema denticola shuttle vector based on the naturally occurring spirochete plasmid pTS1 and the expression of the heterologous T. pallidum flaA gene from the plasmid in T. denticola. This new shuttle vector system should prove useful in characterizing virulence factors from unculturable pathogenic spirochetes.
TI  - Mitogenic activity of the outer membrane of Treponema denticola.
AB  - The outer membrane (OM) was isolated by detergent extraction from Treponema denticola ATCC 35405, ATCC 33521 and ATCC 35404, representing serovars a, b and c, respectively, as well as from two fresh isolates of T. denticola. Strict precautions were undertaken against the introduction of contaminant lipopolysaccharide when the OM was isolated. The OM was active in mitogenic stimulation of C3H/HeOuJ mouse spleen cultures, but to a somewhat lesser extent than purified lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli 055:B5. Polymyxin B only partially inhibited the response. Unheated OM abrogated mitogenic activity of E. coli LPS, but heated preparations enhanced the mitogenic activity of E. coli LPS, suggesting the presence of a heat-labile cytolytic factor associated with T. denticola OM in addition to a putative lipopolysaccharide and/or heat-stable lipoprotein.
TI  - Molecular characterization of a chemotaxis operon in the oral spirochete, Treponema denticola.
AB  - A chemotaxis gene cluster from Treponema denticola (Td), a pathogenic spirochete  associated with human periodontal diseases, was cloned, sequenced, and analyzed. The gene cluster contained three chemotaxis (che) genes (cheA, cheW, and cheY) and an open reading frame (cheX) that is homologous with Treponema pallidum (Tp) and Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) cheX. The Td che genes have the same transcriptional orientation with a sigma 70-like promoter located upstream of cheA and a stem-loop structure characteristic of a Rho-independent transcriptional terminator downstream of cheY. Primer extension analysis identified a transcriptional start point six nucleotides (nt) downstream of the -10 (TAAAAA) promoter sequence. Reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) data indicated that cheA through cheY are co-transcribed and suggested that transcription is terminated after cheY. The gene organization of the Td che operon is identical to that of the Tp che operon. Southern blot analysis indicated the presence of one copy of each che gene on the Td genome. The cheA, cheW, cheX, and cheY genes are 2403, 1332, 462, and 438nt long, respectively, and encode proteins with predicted molecular masses of 88.2, 49.7, 16.8, and 16. 0kDa, respectively. Functional domains of the T. denticola CheA and CheY proteins are highly conserved with those of the Escherichia coli (Ec) CheA and CheY proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of Td CheY indicated that it is closely related to Tp CheY and Bb CheY3.
TI  - Cystalysin, a 46-kDa L-cysteine desulfhydrase from Treponema denticola: biochemical and biophysical characterization.
AB  - A 46-kDa hemolytic protein referred to as cystalysin, from Treponema denticola ATCC 35404, was characterized and overexpressed in Escherichia coli LC-67. Cystalysin lysed erythrocytes, hemoxidized hemoglobin to sulfhemoglobin and methemoglobin, and removed the sulfhydryl and amino group from selected S-containing compounds (e.g., cysteine) producing H2S, NH3, and pyruvate. With L-cysteine as substrate, cystalysin obeys Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Cystathionine and s-aminoethyl-L-cysteine were also substrates. Several of the small alpha amino acids were found to be competitive inhibitors of cystalysin. The enzymatic activity was increased by beta-mercaptoethanol and was not inhibited by the proteinase inhibitor TLCK (N alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone), pronase, or proteinase K, suggesting the functional site was physically protected or located in a small fragment of the polypeptide. We hypothesize that cystalysin is a pyridoxal-5-phosphate-containing enzyme with the activity of an alphaC-N and betaC-S lyase (cystathionase). Since high amounts of H2S have been reported in deep periodontal pockets, this metabolic enzyme from T. denticola may also function in vivo as an important virulence molecule.
TI  - Serological evidence of spirochaetal infections associated with digital dermatitis in dairy cattle.
AB  - A potentially infectious aetiology for digital dermatitis in dairy cattle was investigated and centred on the possible involvement of spirochaetes. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to detect bovine anti-Borrelia burgdorferi (B31) and anti-Treponeme (USA bovine isolates) antibodies in the sera of cows; sera were further tested for antigen specificity by Western blotting. Compared to normal cows, those with digital dermatitis had a much higher seropositivity rate to B. burgdorferi and the treponemes. Significant correlations were shown between antibodies to B. burgdorferi and to Treponemes (P < 0.001), suggesting strong cross-reacting epitopes shared by these spirochaetes. In Western blotting of B. burgdorferi antigens, the main band detected by ELISA positive sera was the 41 kDa flagellar protein; lesser frequency of staining was seen with 34 (OspB), 39 and 55 kDa bands. For the USA treponeme antigens, ELISA positive sera gave reactions to the 34-kDa band and also bands at 41 and 55 kDa. Polyclonal antibodies to Treponema denticola and T. vincentii showed reactions with the bovine treponemes which were predominantly to the 34-kDa antigen. Monoclonal antibodies to B. burgdorferi flagella (41 kDa) antigen and OspA (31 kDa) did not detect any treponeme bands in Western blotting. The study has provided serological evidence that spirochaetes (which are related to human treponemes) may be involved in the pathogenesis of digital dermatitis.
TI  - Characterization of a novel methyl-accepting chemotaxis gene, dmcB, from the oral spirochete Treponema denticola.
AB  - Immediately downstream from the previously isolated Treponema denticola ATCC 35405 prtB gene coding for a chymotrypsinlike protease activity, an open reading frame, ORF3, was identified which shared significant homology with the highly conserved domains (HCDs) of bacterial methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs). Nucleotide sequencing of this ORF revealed that the gene would code for a protein with a size of approximately 41 kDa. In addition, this sequence contained a domain which was virtually identical to the HCD of a recently characterized MCP, DmcA, of strain 35405. Therefore, this ORF was named dmcB. Northern blot analysis suggested that dmcB was part of an operon structure containing prtB. Insertional inactivation of dmcB utilizing an ermF-ermAM cassette resulted in a mutant with decreased chemoattraction toward nutrient supplements. In addition, the mutant displayed an altered pattern of methylated proteins under conditions of chemotaxis. Inactivation of the dmcB gene also attenuated the methylation of the DmcA protein. These results suggest that the dmcB gene codes for an MCP in T. denticola which may interact with other MCPs in these organisms.
TI  - Aspartate transcarbamylase from the hyperthermophilic eubacterium Thermotoga maritima: fused catalytic and regulatory polypeptides form an allosteric enzyme.
AB  - In the allosteric aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase) from the hyperthermophilic  eubacterium Thermotoga maritima, the catalytic and regulatory functions, which in class B ATCases are carried out by specialized polypeptides, are combined on a single type of polypeptide assembled in trimers. The ATCases from T. maritima and Treponema denticola present intriguing similarities, suggesting horizontal gene transfer.
TI  - Dentilisin activity affects the organization of the outer sheath of Treponema denticola.
AB  - Prolyl-phenylalanine-specific serine protease (dentilisin) is a major extracellular protease produced by Treponema denticola. The gene, prtP, coding for the protease was recently cloned and sequenced (K. Ishihara, T. Miura, H. K. Kuramitsu, and K. Okuda, Infect. Immun. 64:5178-5186, 1996). In order to determine the role of this protease in the physiology and virulence of T. denticola, a dentilisin-deficient mutant, K1, was constructed following electroporation with a prtP-inactivated DNA fragment. No chymotrypsin-like protease activity was detected in the dentilisin-deficient mutant. In addition, the high-molecular-mass oligomeric protein characteristic of the outer sheath of the organism decreased in the mutant. Furthermore, the hydrophobicity of the mutant was decreased, and coaggregation of the mutant with Fusobacterium nucleatum was enhanced compared to that of the wild-type organism. The results obtained with a mouse abscess model system indicated that the virulence of the mutant was attenuated relative to that of the wild-type organism. These results suggest that dentilisin activity plays a major role in the structural organization of the outer sheath of T. denticola. The loss of dentilsin activity and the structural change in the outer sheath affect the pathogenicity of T. denticola.
TI  - Characterization of a methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein gene, dmcA, from the oral spirochete Treponema denticola.
AB  - A gene, dmcA, expressing a methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein (MCP) from the oral spirochete Treponema denticola has been characterized. The gene was initially identified as an open reading frame immediately upstream from the previously characterized prtB protease gene of strain ATCC 35405. Nucleotide sequencing of the dmcA gene revealed a potential 57-kDa protein product with extensive homology with the signaling regions of MCPs from a variety of bacteria. The protein expressed in Escherichia coli cross-reacted with anti-Trg (E. coli MCP) serum, confirming its homology with MCPs. Northern blot and primer extension analyses identified the transcription start site of the monocistronic dmcA mRNA. By utilizing a T. denticola gene inactivation system recently developed in this laboratory, a mutant defective in the dmcA gene, HL0501, was constructed. The mutant was demonstrated to be defective in chemotaxis toward nutrients. In addition, the methylation profiles of cellular proteins indicated altered MCPs in the mutant relative to those of the parental strain. These results indicate that we have identified an MCP gene in the oral spirochete which plays a significant role in the chemotactic response of the organism.
TI  - Cystalysin, a 46-kilodalton cysteine desulfhydrase from Treponema denticola, with hemolytic and hemoxidative activities.
AB  - A 46-kDa hemolytic protein, referred to as cystalysin, from Treponema denticola ATCC 35404 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli LC-67. Both the native and recombinant 46-kDa proteins were purified to homogeneity. Both proteins expressed identical biological and functional characteristics. In addition to its biological function of lysing erythrocytes and hemoxidizing the hemoglobin to methemoglobin, cystalysin was also capable of removing the sulfhydryl and amino groups from selected S-containing compounds (e.g., cysteine) producing H2S, NH3, and pyruvate. This cysteine desulfhydrase resulted in the following Michaelis-Menten kinetics: Km = 3.6 mM and k(cat) = 12 s(-1). Cystathionine and S-aminoethyl-L-cysteine were also substrates for the protein. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of the end products revealed NH3, pyruvate, homocysteine (from cystathionine), and cysteamine (from S-aminoethyl-L-cysteine). The enzyme was active over a broad pH range, with highest activity at pH 7.8 to 8.0. The enzymatic activity was increased by beta-mercaptoethanol. It was not inhibited by the proteinase inhibitor TLCK (N alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone), pronase, or proteinase K, suggesting that the functional site was physically protected or located in a small fragment of the polypeptide. We hypothesize that cystalysin is a pyridoxal-5-phosphate-containing enzyme, with activity of an alphaC-N and betaC-S lyase (cystathionase) type. Since large amounts of H2S have been reported in deep periodontal pockets, cystalysin may also function in vivo as an important virulence molecule.
TI  - Genetic and transcriptional analysis of flgB flagellar operon constituents in the oral spirochete Treponema denticola and their heterologous expression in enteric bacteria.
AB  - Oral spirochetes possess many potential virulence factors, including the capacity for tissue invasion and persistence despite a vigorous host immune response. In an attempt to identify treponemal immunoreactive components, sera derived from individuals with advanced periodontal disease were used as a reagent to isolate recombinant bacteriophage lambda clones expressing antigens of the oral spirochete Treponema denticola ATCC 35405. Nucleotide sequence analysis of a clone expressing three immunoreactive products has revealed seven T. denticola genes which appear to encode homologs of flagellar basal body constituents, FlgB, FlgC, FliE, and FliF, a flagellar switch component, FliG, and the putative flagellar export proteins, FliH and FliI, initially characterized in Salmonella typhimurium. Also identified was a gene resembling fliJ. Primer extension analysis identified a transcriptional start site 5' to the treponemal flgB gene. Appropriately spaced with respect to this start site was a sigma28 binding motif. The absence of additional identifiable sigma factor binding motifs within the treponemal sequence and the proximity of adjacent genes suggested operonic arrangement, and reverse transcriptase PCR provided evidence of cotranscription. Supporting the identification of these genes as flagellar components, heterologous expression in enteric bacteria of the putative switch basal body genes from T. denticola interfered with motility. Specifically, the presence of a plasmid expressing treponemal fliG reduced swarming motility in S. typhimurium, while in Escherichia coli, this plasmid conferred a nonmotile phenotype and a reduction in flagellar number. Thus, while spirochetal flagella are subject to unique synthetic and functional constraints, the organization of flagellar genes and the presence of sigma28-like elements are reminiscent of the flagellar systems of other bacteria, and there appears to be sufficient conservation of constituent proteins to allow interaction between T. denticola switch-basal body proteins and the flagellar machinery of gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Conservation of msp, the gene encoding the major outer membrane protein of oral Treponema spp.
AB  - The major surface protein (Msp) of Treponema denticola has been implicated as a mediator of the interaction between the spirochete and the gingival epithelium in periodontal diseases. Previous studies showed that the Msp of T. denticola ATCC 35405 had porin activity, depolarized epithelial cell membranes, bound to extracellular matrix components of epithelial cells, and formed a regular hexagonal surface array in the treponemal outer membrane. The gene encoding Msp in ATCC 35405 was recently cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli (J. C. Fenno, K.-H. Muller, and B. C. McBride, J. Bacteriol. 178:2489-2496, 1996). In the present study, we identified genes encoding Msp-like proteins in several oral spirochetes. A prominent heat-modifiable Msp-like protein having an apparent molecular mass of between 43 and 64 kDa was present in all oral spirochete strains tested. Antibodies raised against the ATCC 35405 Msp reacted strongly with the Msp proteins of T. denticola ATCC 35404 and T. vincentii, reacted very weakly with the Msp protein of T. denticola ATCC 33520, and did not react with T. denticola OTK, T. socranskii, and T. pectinovorum. The msp loci of the T. denticola strains and T. vincentii were identified in analyses using PCR with oligonucleotide primers derived from the DNA sequence flanking msp in ATCC 35405. Southern blot analysis showed at least three groups of related msp DNA sequences. Comparison of DNA sequences of the 5' and 3' ends of the msp genes showed high sequence homology in the flanking regions and signal peptide coding regions, while the homologies between regions encoding the mature peptide were as low as 50%. The entire msp DNA sequences of T. denticola ATCC 33520 and OTK were determined, and the deduced Msp amino acid sequences were compared to the sequence of the previously reported Msp of ATCC 35405. The results show that the msp locus is conserved in oral treponemes but that there are significant differences between the mature Msp peptides of different strains. Further studies of the antigenic domains, functional domains, and physical structures of Msp proteins, based on these results, will enhance understanding of the role of Msp in the cytopathology associated with oral spirochetes.
TI  - Development of a gene transfer system in Treponema denticola by electroporation.
AB  - Treponema denticola is strongly implicated in the etiology of periodontal diseases. However, genetic transformation of this organism has not been reported. We now demonstrate a gene transfer system in T. denticola by electroporation using a broad host plasmid pKT210 as a shuttle vector. Plasmid extraction, Southern blot hybridization as well as the polymerase chain reaction indicated the presence of the plasmid in T. denticola transformants. The restriction patterns of plasmid pKT210 rescued from the T. denticola transformants in Escherichea coli suggested that some of the rescued plasmids were identical to the original pKT210, but some of them had been modified. This transformation system could be a potentially useful tool for genetic manipulation of oral spirochetes.
TI  - The peptidolytic capacity of the spirochete system.
AB  - Relatively scant chemical information has been available on the proteinases and peptidases of spirochetes in spite of the association of spirochetes with several serious infections known to plague humans and other animal species. This situation has partly resulted from difficulties in growing some spirochetes under laboratory conditions. The cells of Treponema denticola, a spirochete suggested to be associated with periodontal infections, have turned out to be a good source of new chemical information on those enzymes. Latest studies suggest that the outer cell envelope or the periplasmic space of T. denticola contains several novel proteinases and peptidases (hence called "ectoenzymes") which may contribute to the chronicity of periodontal infections. Some of the oligopeptidases discovered are specific for proline-containing host tissue peptides such as substance P, bradykinin, neurotensin, etc., and possibly small collagen fragments. The only spirochetal peptidases purified to give a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis have been obtained from T. denticola. One particular peptidase, suggested to be similar to the oligopeptidase B (EC 3.4.21.83) of Escherichia coli seems to be present in the cell envelope or in the periplasmic space at quite large concentrations. The presence of this and several other peptidases in the outer cell structures of the treponemes suggests that such enzymes are important for the nutrition of these highly motile and invasive organisms. The biological role of these enzymes can thus be envisaged in the peptidolytic processing of host tissue proteins and peptides to gradually smaller molecules to fulfill the nutritional requirements of these organisms. Although the genetic similarity between T. denticola and some other treponemes and spirochetes can be hotly debated, it is nevertheless now possible to use T. denticula enzymes as suitable objects for comparison when the chemistry of other spirochetes is studied.
TI  - Sequence analysis, expression, and binding activity of recombinant major outer sheath protein (Msp) of Treponema denticola.
AB  - The gene encoding the major outer sheath protein (Msp) of the oral spirochete Treponema denticola ATCC 35405 was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. Preliminary sequence analysis showed that the 5' end of the msp gene was not present on the 5.5-kb cloned fragment described in a recent study (M. Haapasalo, K. H. Muller, V. J. Uitto, W. K. Leung, and B. C. McBride, Infect. Immun. 60:2058-2065,1992). The 5' end of msp was obtained by PCR amplification from a T. denticola genomic library, and an open reading frame of 1,629 bp was identified as the coding region for Msp by combining overlapping sequences. The deduced peptide consisted of 543 amino acids and had a molecular mass of 58,233 Da. The peptide had a typical prokaryotic signal sequence with a potential cleavage site for signal peptidase 1. Northern (RNA) blot analysis showing the msp transcript to be approximately 1.7 kb was consistent with the identification of a promoter consensus sequence located optimally upstream of msp and a transcription termination signal found downstream of the stop codon. The entire msp sequence was amplified from T. denticola genomic DNA and cloned in E. coli by using a tightly regulated T7 RNA polymerase vector system. Expression of Msp was toxic to E. coli when the entire msp gene was present. High levels of Msp were produced as inclusion bodies when the putative signal peptide sequence was deleted and replaced by a vector-encoded T7 peptide sequence. Recombinant Msp purified to homogeneity from a clone containing the full-length msp gene adhered to immobilized laminin and fibronectin but not to bovine serum albumin. Attachment of recombinant Msp was decreased in the presence of soluble substrate. Attachment of T. denticola to immobilized laminin and fibronectin was increased by pretreatment of the substrate with recombinant Msp. These studies lend further support to the hypothesis that Msp mediates the extracellular matrix binding activity of T. denticola.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Treponema denticola detection in oral plaque samples using the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Detection of putative pathogens is critical for delineating the etiology and progression of periodontitis. In the present study, we have used a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay utilizing primers specific for the lkt A gene of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, the fimbrial gene of Porphyromonas gingivalis, and tdp A gene of Treponema denticola in order to determine the presence of these pathogens in subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis sites. These gene specific primers were also used to assess the detection of different strains of bacteria in the PCR assays. Primers for P. gingivalis detected P. gingivalis strain 33277, but no product was detected when primers were used with extracts from 4 species of Capnocytophaga, 3 species of Prevotella, 2 species of Porphyromonas other than P. gingivalis, Bacteroides levii, Escherichia coli, 3 strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans and 3 strains of T. denticola. PCR analysis using primers for the lkt A gene of A. actinomycetemcomitans also did not result in a product with any of these bacteria with the exception of a positive result with 3 different strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans. Primers selected from the tdp A gene of T. denticola did not identify any of the bacteria strains tested except T. denticola serovars a, b, and c. Thus, these primers were shown to amplify gene segments that are specific to either P. gingivalis (33277), A. actinomycetemcomitans (33384, 43717 and 43718) or T. denticola (35405, 33521 and 35404). The PCR assay may be used to rapidly detect the presence of periodontal pathogens in the future.
TI  - The 46-kilodalton-hemolysin gene from Treponema denticola encodes a novel hemolysin homologous to aminotransferases.
AB  - The 46-kDa hemolysin produced by Treponema denticola may be involved in the etiology of periodontitis. In order to initiate a genetic analysis of the role of this protein in disease, its gene has been cloned. Synthetic oligonucleotides, designed on the basis of the previously reported amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the 45-kDa hemolysin, were used as primers in a PCR to amplify part of the hemolysin (hly) gene. This PCR product was then used to clone the entire hly gene from libraries of T. denticola genomic DNA. Constructs containing the entire cloned region on plasmids in Escherichia coli produced both hemolysis and hemoxidation activities either on sheep blood agar plates or in liquid assays. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot (immunoblot) analysis revealed that the constructs synthesized a protein with molecular size of about 46 kDa which was reactive with anti-T. denticola hemolysin. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that the largest open reading frame could encode a protein with a calculated molecular size of 46.2 kDa. The first 31 amino acids encoded by this open reading frame were identical to the experimentally determined amino-terminal sequence of the 45-kDa hemolysin. These results indicate that the entire hly gene has been cloned. The deduced amino acid sequence of the T. denticola hly gene is homologous (23 to 37% identity) to those of proteins that are members of a family of pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent aminotransferases. This suggests that the 46-kDa hemolysin may be related to an aminotransferase and have a novel mechanism of hemolysis. However, the functional aspects of this relationship remain to be investigated.
TI  - A role for bacteriophages in the evolution and transfer of bacterial virulence determinants.
AB  - A virulence-associated region in the genome of Dichelobacter nodosus has been shown to contain an integrase gene which is highly related to the integrases of Shigella flexneri phage Sf6 and coliphages P4 and phi R73, together with open reading frames (vapB, C and D) related to genes borne on plasmids in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Treponema denticola. Similar to P4 and phi R73, the vap region is bracketed by putative bacteriophage att sites and is adjacent to a tRNA gene, which suggests that the vap region has been derived by the integration of a bacteriophage, or a plasmid carrying a bacteriophage-related integrase gene. Many similarities in genes and genes clusters encoding virulence determinants have been found in distantly related bacteria. These genes are often located on plasmids in one organism but on the chromosome in others, implying that transmission of the genes has been followed by integration. Thus, the events which have generated the vap regions of D. nodosus may represent a common mechanism for transfer of virulence determinants. A number of genes involved in the virulence of bacterial pathogens are found on integrated bacteriophages, and we suggest that others will prove to be associated with tRNA genes and/or integrase genes derived from bacteriophages. The use of tRNA genes as integration sites for many bacteriophages and plasmids may favour intergeneric transmission, as tRNA genes are highly conserved.
TI  - Cloning and expression of a neutral phosphatase gene from Treponema denticola.
AB  - We have isolated and characterized a neutral phosphatase gene, phoN, from Treponema denticola ATCC 35405. The gene was isolated from a T. denticola clone bank constructed in the medium-copy-number plasmid vector pMCL19. Subcloning and nucleotide sequencing of the DNA insert from one phosphatase clone, pTph14, revealed that the activity corresponded to an open reading frame consisting of 1,027 bp coding for a 37.9-kDa protein. Hydrophobicity analysis indicated that the protein exhibits some hydrophobic regions. Indeed, partial purification of the phosphatase suggested that the enzyme was membrane associated both in T. denticola and in the Escherichia coli clone. The pH optimum of the enzyme, approximately pH 6.4, indicated that it corresponded to a neutral phosphatase activity from T. denticola. An examination of possible natural substrates for the enzyme suggested that this enzyme hydrolyzes nucleoside di- and triphosphates. Northern (RNA) blot analysis revealed that this phosphatase gene is not likely to be present in an operon structure.
TI  - Ribotyping on small-sized spirochetes isolated from subgingival plaque.
AB  - In the present study DNA restriction patterns and corresponding ribotypes of 17 subgingival small-sized spirochetes (1:2:1 and 2:4:2 isolates), 2 Treponema socranskii strains and two Treponema denticola strains were examined. Purified chromosomal DNA was digested by BamHI, HindIII, PstI and ClaI. The DNA fragments were separated in a horizontal slab of 0.7% agarose containing ethidium bromide and transferred by nylon membranes. Hybridization was carried out with digoxigenin-labelled copy DNA of 16S and 23S ribosomal RNA from Escherichia coli. Depending on the restriction endonuclease used, up to 4 distinct bands were observed for the 2:4:2 isolates and the T. denticola strains. For each of the endonucleases used, identical band patterns were always observed for this group of isolates, and these patterns differed persistently from the T. denticola strains. For the 1:2:1 strains, up to 11 distinct bands were observed after digestion with HindIII, whereas a maximum of 6 bands were observed when PstI or ClaI was used. By using ClaI, the examined 1:2:1 isolates were separated into 8 groups, whereas PstI and HindIII separated these isolates into 5 groups. The ribotyping showed that the tested 1:2:1 spirochetes were more heterogeneous than the 2:4:2 spirochetes examined.
TI  - Cloning and sequence analysis of a chymotrypsinlike protease from Treponema denticola.
AB  - A clone expressing a Treponema denticola chymotrypsinlike protease from recombinant plasmid pSA2 was identified in a genomic library of T. denticola ATCC 35405. Nucleotide sequencing of the insert identified an open reading frame, designated the prtB gene, which codes for the protease. Two potential inverted repeat sequences are present both upstream and downstream from the prtB gene. The prtB gene would code for a putative protein of 273 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 30.4 kDa and an estimated pI of 7.0. The G+C content of the gene is 40.3%. The results of maxicell analysis are consistent with the expression of a 30-kDa protease from the prtB gene. Preliminary characterization of the protease indicated that it was inhibited by the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, diisopropylfluorophosphate, and N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone but not by N alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone. Purification of the protease was accomplished with the PinPoint protein purification system following construction of site-directed mutagenized plasmid pXa-3:2. The purified protease degraded human and bovine serum albumins as well as casein. Furthermore, hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes by the protease was observed. Northern (RNA) blot analysis of mRNA extracted from strain 35405 indicated a single 1.9-kb mRNA species containing the prtB transcript. In addition, the results of primer extension analysis indicated that transcription was initiated primarily at a T residue. However, no corresponding -10 and -35 sequences related to Escherichia coli promoter sequences were identified. The availability of the purified protein and its gene will aid in evaluating the potential role of the protease in the physiology and virulence of T. denticola since proteases may play a key role in oral treponemal pathogenicity.
TI  - Diversity of cultivable and uncultivable oral spirochetes from a patient with severe destructive periodontitis.
AB  - To determine the genetic diversity of cultivable and uncultivable spirochetes in  the gingival crevice of a patient with severe periodontitis, partial 16S rRNA genes were cloned from PCR-amplified products of DNA and RNA extracted from a subgingival plaque sample. Approximately 500 bp were amplified in PCRs by using universally conserved primers with polylinker tails. Purified PCR products were cloned into Escherichia coli by using the plasmid vector pUC19. The resultant clone library was screened by colony hybridization with a radiolabeled, treponeme-specific oligonucleotide probe. The 16S rRNA inserts of 81 spirochetal clones were then sequenced by standard procedures. Sequences were compared with 16S rRNA sequences of 35 spirochetes, including the four known cultivable oral treponeme species. The analysis revealed an unexpected diversity of oral treponemes from a single patient. When 98% or greater sequence similarity was used as the definition of a species-level cluster, the clone sequences were found to represent 23 species. When 92% similarity was used as the definition, the clones fell into eight major groups, only two of which contained named species, Treponema vincentii and Treponema denticola, while Treponema pectinovorum and Treponema socranskii were not represented in any cluster. Seven of the 81 spirochetal clones were found to contain chimeric 16S rRNA sequences. In situ fluorescence hybridization with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled oligonucleotide probe specific for one of the new species representing cluster 19 was used to identify cells of the target species directly in clinical samples.
TI  - Cloning and expression of hemolysin genes from Treponema denticola strains ATCC 35404 (TD-4) and human clinical isolate GM-1 in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The oral spirochete, Treponema denticola is a putative etiologic agent in adult periodontitis, and acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis. In vitro, the oral treponeme produces several factors including proteases, hemolysins, hemin-binding proteins, which could potentially be involved in the virulence of this spirochete. Our laboratory has been investigating the pathobiology of T. denticola, and has demonstrated the production of several hemolysins by T. denticola. In this report two hemolysin genes from T. denticola strains ATCC 35404 (TD-4) and GM-1 were isolated by screening genomic DNA libraries of T. denticola on sheep blood agar plates. Physical maps of the insert fragments were not identical. Southern blot analyses suggested some degree of homology in the nucleotide sequence. Maxicell analyses of [35S]-methionine-labeled polypeptides from the recombinant plasmids have suggested the synthesis of an approximately 62.5 kDa polypeptide. Biochemical characterization of the T. denticola hemolysin genes indicated the activity to be inhibited by Mg2+, Ca2+ and Zn2+ but not by EDTA. Dithiothreitol and glutathione moderately enhanced the hemolytic activity of the recombinant plasmids. Iron partially inhibited the hemolytic activities. Addition of 2-2' bipyridyl moderately enhanced the activities, possibly by iron limitation. These results suggest the isolation of an identical hemolysin gene from T. denticola strains TD-4 and GM-1.
TI  - Similarity between the 38-kilodalton lipoprotein of Treponema pallidum and the glucose/galactose-binding (MglB) protein of Escherichia coli.
AB  - The recent discovery that abundant and immunogenic lipoproteins constitute the integral membrane proteins of Treponema pallidum has prompted efforts to investigate their importance in the physiology and ultrastructure of the organism and in immune responses during infection. Earlier studies identified a 38-kDa lipoprotein of T. pallidum believed to be specific to the pathogen. In the present study, monoclonal antibodies generated against the 38-kDa lipoprotein of T. pallidum reacted with cognate 37-kDa molecules in the nonpathogens Treponema phagedenis, Treponema denticola, and Treponema refringens. Cloning and expression of the 38-kDa-lipoprotein gene of T. pallidum in Escherichia coli revealed that the recombinant product displayed a slightly larger (39-kDa) apparent molecular mass but remained reactive with anti-38-kDa-protein monoclonal antibodies. The recombinant product was processed and acylated in E. coli. DNA and amino acid sequence analyses indicated an open reading frame encoding 403 amino acids, with the first 25 amino acids corresponding to a leader peptide terminated by a signal peptidase II processing site of Val-Val-Gly-Cys. The predicted mature protein is 378 amino acids in length with a deduced molecular weight of 40,422 (excluding acylation). Southern blotting failed to demonstrate in nonpathogenic treponemes genomic sequences homologous with the 38-kDa-lipoprotein gene of T. pallidum. Computer analysis revealed that the 38-kDa lipoprotein of T. pallidum had 34.2% identity and 58.9% similarity with the glucose/galactose-binding protein (MglB) of E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium. Furthermore, of the 19 amino acids of MglB involved in carbohydrate binding, the 38-kDa lipoprotein had identity with 11. These studies have allowed the first putative functional assignment (carbohydrate binding) to a T. pallidum integral membrane protein. Recognition of this potential physiological role for the 38-kDa lipoprotein underscores the possibility that the membrane biology of T. pallidum may more closely resemble that of gram-positive organisms, which also utilize lipoproteins as anchored transporters, than that of gram-negative bacteria to which T. pallidum often is analogized.
TI  - Characterization of antisera raised against Treponema denticola (ATCC 33521) whole cell, outer sheath, protoplasmic cylinder, and axial flagella.
AB  - In this study we produced polyclonal antisera directed to whole cell, outer sheath, protoplasmic cylinder and axial flagella sonicates of Treponema denticola (ATCC 33521) reference strain. Furthermore, the reactivity of the antisera was determined, using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting techniques. As control antigen, other gram-negative bacteria (Salmonella minnesota, Escherichia coli) and related pathogenic spirochetes (Borrelia burgdorferi and Treponema pallidum) were used. It could be shown that the purified antibodies were specific for Treponema denticola and did not cross-react with the control antigens tested. Interestingly, with one exception, the anti-axial flagella antibody reacted with the flagellin of Treponema pallidum but not with Borrelia burgdorferi flagella. It is intended to use these antisera for the characterization of patient isolates in further studies.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the aspartate carbamoyltransferase gene from Treponema  denticola.
AB  - Treponema denticola seems to play a central role in the etiology of human periodontal disease. We have cloned an antigenic protein-coding sequence from T. denticola ATCC 33520. The protein-coding region was found to be a 3-kbp HindIII-HindIII fragment. The open reading frame consists of 1,426 bp and codes for a protein with an M(r) of 54,919. The deduced amino acid sequence showed 33.8% homology with that of the aspartate carbamoyltransferase of Escherichia coli. The gene products showed aspartate carbamoyltransferase activity.
TI  - Polymerase chain reaction for detection of Leptospira spp. in clinical samples.
AB  - A sensitive assay for Leptospira spp., the causative agent of leptospirosis, was  developed on the basis of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A 331-bp sequence from the Leptospira interrogans serovar canicola rrs (16S) gene was amplified, and the PCR products were analyzed by DNA-DNA hybridization by using a 289-bp fragment internal to the amplified DNA. Specific PCR products also were obtained with DNA from the closely related nonpathogenic Leptospira biflexa but not with DNA from other spirochetes, such as Borrelia burgdorferi, Borrelia hermsii, Treponema denticola, Treponema pallidum, Spirochaeta aurantia, or more distant organisms such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Proteus mirabilis. The assay was able to detect as few as 10 bacteria. Leptospira DNA was detected in urine from experimentally infected mice. In addition, the test was found to be suitable for diagnosing leptospirosis in humans. Cerebrospinal fluid and urine from patients with leptospirosis were positive, whereas samples from control uninfected patients were negative.
TI  - Characterization, cloning, and binding properties of the major 53-kilodalton Treponema denticola surface antigen.
AB  - Treponema denticola surface proteins were studied for their biochemical and biological characteristics. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis of detergent extracts of whole cells revealed a major protein of 53 kDa and a number of minor proteins. Antiserum raised against whole cells of T. denticola ATCC 35405 reacted with the 53-kDa protein and a 72-kDa protein but not with the other proteins. Immunoelectron microscopy with anti-53-kDa-protein antibodies showed that the 53-kDa protein is located on the surface of the cell. SDS-PAGE analysis of unheated samples indicated that the 53-kDa protein is the major component of oligomers with molecular masses ranging from 130 to 300 kDa. Western blot (immunoblot) analysis showed that the high-molecular-mass oligomers reacted with whole-cell antiserum and anti-53-kDa-protein antibody. The aggregates dissociated into their subunits after heating to 70 degrees C. Isoelectric focusing followed by SDS-PAGE indicated that the 53-kDa protein was separated into several forms with apparent pI values ranging from 8.0 to 5.5. The oligomeric forms were highly resistant to proteolysis by trypsin and proteinase K, whereas the monomeric proteins were readily digested. A clone expressing a 53-kDa antigen in Escherichia coli was isolated from a lambda ZAP II DNA library of T. denticola ATCC 35405. The recombinant protein had exactly the same molecular mass as the major 53-kDa T. denticola surface protein and reacted with antisera raised against this protein. The role of T. denticola ATCC 35405 surface proteins in attachment to laminin, fibronectin, gelatin, fibrinogen, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) was studied by a modified Western blot binding assay. Fibronectin, laminin, and fibrinogen attached to the 53-kDa surface protein of T. denticola as well as to a 72-kDa protein, whereas no attachment to gelatin or BSA was observed. Attachment could be inhibited by pretreating the blots with fibrinogen but not with gelatin or BSA. Our results suggest that the 53-kDa major surface protein of T. denticola may play a role in the attachment to host proteins and may thus be an important virulence determinant of this species.
TI  - Cloning and expression of protease genes from Treponema denticola in Escherichia  coli.
AB  - A gene bank of random fragments of chromosomal DNA from Treponema denticola ATCC  33520 was constructed in the bacteriophage vector lambda L47.1. The gene bank was plated on Escherichia coli C600 and screened for the presence of plaques in which enzyme activity was expressed, using overlays of fluorogenic synthetic substrates and a two-step procedure in which immunological screening was followed by enzyme assays of immunopositive lysates. Recombinants expressing trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like and proline iminopeptidase activities were found. The gene for the trypsin-like activity was subcloned into plasmid pJDC9 and maintained in E. coli.
TI  - Use of randomly cloned DNA fragments for the identification of oral spirochetes.
AB  - DNA probes were produced for the detection and identification of 4 cultivable species of oral spirochetes, Treponema denticola, Treponema socranskii, Treponema vincentii and Treponema pectinovorum. To obtain probe sequences, chromosomal DNA, isolated from representative strains within each species, was cloned in Escherichia coli K-12. Cloned DNA fragments were screened for the ability to hybridize to DNA only from homologous strains. Several such fragments were identified and shown to be specific when tested against a series of DNAs from gram-negative and gram-positive oral bacteria. The selected probe sequences were semi-conserved within strains of T. denticola and T. socranskii such that restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was observed. In the case of T. socranskii, RFLP was useful in distinguishing between the 3 known subspecies. Chromosomal DNA fragments from 2 strains of T. vincentii failed to cross-hybridize, under stringent conditions, to genomic DNA from each of these strains. The hybridization probes were suitable for the identification of clinical isolates of T. denticola and could be used to detect the presence of individual Treponema species in mixed cultures. On this basis, the probes were used successfully to detect T. denticola in uncultured plaque samples.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a plasmid from Treponema denticola.
AB  - Agarose gel electrophoresis of whole genomic DNA of the oral spirochaete Treponema denticola has revealed a plasmid-like fraction. Purification and restriction enzyme analysis has confirmed the presence of a 2.6-kb circular plasmid, which has been mapped for restriction sites and cloned into the Escherichia coli plasmid pUC18. Southern blot analysis of genomic T. denticola DNA, using the plasmid as a probe, has shown that the plasmid is present only as an extra-chromosomal element. No plasmid-coded recombinant gene product from a PstI insert in pUC18 has been detected in host cells of E. coli by SDS-PAGE or immunoblotting with polyclonal immune rabbit serum to T. denticola. The discovery of this plasmid may provide a useful tool in the application of new molecular approaches in spirochaetal biology.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of the Treponema denticola prtA gene coding for chymotrypsinlike protease activity and detection of a closely linked gene encoding PZ-PLGPA-hydrolyzing activity.
AB  - The chymotrypsinlike protease gene (prtA) from Treponema denticola ATCC 35405 was isolated from a lambda gt11 clone bank as one of several clones expressing protease activity. The DNA from one positive clone capable of hydrolyzing type IV collagen was subcloned into plasmid vector pUC119 for further analysis. Deletion analysis of subclone pXQ27.2 revealed the approximate location of the prtA gene on the DNA insert. DEAE-Sephadex chromatography of crude cell extracts of the subclone revealed two distinct T. denticola enzymes, one hydrolyzing SAAPNA (succinyl-L-alanyl-L-alanyl-L-prolyl-L-phenylalanine-p-nitroanilide [chymotrypsin substrate]) and the other hydrolyzing PZ-PLGPA (phenylazobenzyl-oxycarbonyl-L-leucylglycyl-L-prolyl-D -arginine [collagenase substrate]). Each activity was purified to near homogeneity and exhibited by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis estimated molecular sizes of 67 and 36 kDa, respectively. Western blot (immunoblot) analysis demonstrated that only the 67-kDa SAAPNA-hydrolyzing enzyme reacted with antibody against the T. denticola chymotrypsinlike protease. The purified SAAPNA-hydrolyzing enzyme degraded type IV collagen, laminin, and fibronectin, but not type I collagen. These results indicate that the prtA gene coding for the chymotrypsinlike protease from T. denticola has been isolated. Another distinct gene encoding an enzyme hydrolyzing PZ-PLGPA appears to be adjacent to the prtA gene.
TI  - [Chemical composition and biological activities of lipopolysaccharides extracted  from Treponema denticola and Treponema vincentii].
AB  - Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) were isolated from Treponema denticola (T. denticola)  and Treponema vincentii (T. vincentii) by the phenol/water (PW) and the phenol/chloroform/petroleum-ether (PCP) procedures. 1) T. denticola PW-LPS (LPS isolated by the PW procedure), PCP-sup-LPS (LPS isolated by the PCP procedure in the supernates of ultracentrifugation), PCP-ppt-LPS (precipitated LPS isolated by the PCP procedure, obtained after ultracentrifugation), and T. vincentii PCP-ppt-LPS were composed of carbohydrate, hexosamine, protein, fatty acid, and phosphorus. T. vincentii PW-LPS was contained major amount of carbohydrates and small amount of fatty acids. 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonic acid (KDD) was not detected in these LPSs. 2) The major fatty acids of T. denticola PW-LPS and PCP-sup-LPS were palmitic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic acids. The major fatty acids of T. vincentii PCP-ppt-LPS were palmitic, stearic, myristic, oleic, and linoleic acids. Hydroxy fatty acids were not detected. 3) Glucose, galactose, and mannose were comprised in T. denticola PW-LPS. Glucose, galactose, and arabinose were comprised in T. denticola PCP-sup-LPS. Glucose and galactose were comprised in T. vincentii PCP-ppt-LPS. 4) The Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) clotting activity of T. denticola PW-LPS was 1/10, as compared with that of Escherichia coli (E. coli) UKT-B LPS standard. The LAL clotting activities of T. denticola PCP-sup-LPS, T. vincentii PW-LPS, and T. vincentii PCP-ppt-LPS were 1/100, as compared with that of E. coli LPS standard. 5) Five hundred micrograms/kg of T. denticola PCP-sup-LPS was pyrogenic in rabbits. Two thousand micrograms/kg of T. vincentii PCP-ppt-LPS was pyrogenic in rabbits. 6) T. denticola PCP-sup-LPS and T. vincentii PCP-ppt-LPS were capable of increasing or decreasing the release of lysosomal enzymes from human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
TI  - Outer membrane ultrastructure explains the limited antigenicity of virulent Treponema pallidum.
AB  - Freeze fracture and deep etching were used to investigate the ultrastructural basis for the observation that anti-treponemal antibodies bind poorly to the surface of virulent Treponema pallidum. Fractures of T. pallidum outer membranes contained scarce, uniformly sized intramembranous particles (IMPs). IMPs on the convex faces often appeared to form linear arrays that wound in spirals about the organism. In contrast to the outer membrane, IMPs of the cytoplasmic membrane were randomly distributed, numerous, and heterogeneous in size. In Escherichia coli and T. pallidum cofractures, IMPs of the E. coli outer membranes were densely packed within the concave fracture faces, while the T. pallidum fractures were identical to the experiments lacking the E. coli internal controls. Outer membranes of two representative nonpathogenic treponemes, Treponema phagedenis biotype Reiter and Treponema denticola, contained numerous IMPs, which segregated preferentially with the concave halves. Examination of apposed replicas and deep-etched specimens indicated that at least some of the IMPs extend through the T. pallidum outer membrane and are exposed on the surface of the organism. The outer membrane of intact T. pallidum appears to contain a paucity of integral membrane proteins that can serve as targets for specific antibodies. These findings appear to represent an unusual parasitic strategy for evasion of host humoral defenses.
TI  - Serospecificity of a cloned protease-resistant Treponema pallidum--specific antigen expressed in Escherichia coli.
AB  - We evaluated the serological reactivity of a protease-resistant antigen designated 4D which was encoded by Treponema pallidum DNA and was expressed in Escherichia coli from recombinant plasmid pAW329. This 19,000-molecular-weight antigen was purified in its native, non-protease-treated form from E. coli sonic extracts by molecular sieving and ion-exchange chromatography. Antibody binding to antigen 4D was detected by a radioimmunoassay. Antigen 4D-specific antibody was detected in 95% of the sera in a Centers for Disease Control syphilis serum panel. It was also detected in 55% of 121 primary syphilis patients, whereas syphilis antibody was detected in 83% of the sera by a fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test and in 88% of the sera by a T. pallidum microhemagglutination test. In tests of 118 normal sera, less than 3% demonstrated antibody to antigen 4D; these results are similar to microhemagglutination and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test results. Rabbit antisera against Treponema phagedenis, Treponema refringens, Treponema denticola, and Treponema vincentii did not react with antigen 4D.
TI  - Scanning and transmission electron microscopy of the phagocytosis of Treponema denticola and Escherichia coli by human neutrophils in vitro.
AB  - In the present in vitro study, scanning and transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that human neutrophils are able to phagocytize Treponema denticola cells. Two major modes of particle engulfment were detected, both of which seemed unaffected by opsonization or atmosphere (aerobic or anaerobic). The occasional finding of rather intact treponemes as long as 2 h after onset of the phagocytosis experiment, suggested that digestion could be a relatively slow process. Expulsion of digested material from the phagolysosomes to the extracellular space seemed to occur via channel-like structures in the neutrophil cytoplasm.
TI  - Neutrophil phagocytosis of treponema denticola as indicated by extracellular release of lactoferrin.
AB  - Lysosomal enzyme release from viable human neutrophils occurs during phagocytic activity in vivo. Phagocytosis of a strain of T. denticola, an oral spirochete, was indicated by the finding of lactoferrin in the extracellular medium of neutrophils challenged with this organism. The extracellular release of lactoferrin was dependent on duration of bacterial challenge, but peak concentration appeared at a later stage than seen in phagocytosis experiments with Escherichia coli, which served as a control. Neutrophil phagocytosis of T. denticola may be of importance as a defence factor in periodontal disease.
TI  - Demonstration of the in vitro phagocytosis of Treponema denticola by human polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  - A method has been developed for the study of phagocytosis of the oral treponeme T. denticola by human polymorphonuclear neutrophils. T. denticola was labelled with 32P-orthophosphate, and phagocytosis, expressed as counts per mg cell protein, was measured after 15, 60 and 120 min of interaction between neutrophils and treponemes. Four different cell cultures were used as controls, and phagocytosis of E. coli was used as reference. The uptake of radiolabelled T. denticola was significantly larger with the PMNs than with any of the control cells. An increase of uptake was observed from 15 to 120 min. The addition of autologous human serum or rabbit T. denticola antiserum enhanced the phagocytosis 2-3 fold, and phagocytosis was decreased under an anaerobic atmosphere. Scanning electron microscopic studies also indicated that phagocytosis had taken place.
