TI  == antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (itcs) extracted from horseradish (armoracia rusticana) root against oral microorganisms.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (itcs) extracted from horseradish root was investigated against oral microorganisms: 6 strains of facultative anaerobic bacteria, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus casei, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; one strain of yeast, candida albicans, and 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella nigrescens, and clostridium perfringens. the itcs extracted from horseradish root showed antimicrobial activity against all oral microorganisms by the paper disk method.  the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of the itcs extracted from horseradish root ranged from 1.25 to 5.00 mg/ml against 6 strains of facultative  anaerobic bacteria and one strain of yeast, and 4.17 to 16.67 mg/ml against 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria. the itcs extracted from horseradish root showed the strongest antimicrobial activity, with a mbc of 1.25 mg/ml, against c. albicans among facultative microorganisms, and 4.17 mg/ml against f. nucleatum among anaerobic bacteria. these results suggest that the itcs extracted from horseradish root may be a candidate for use as an antimicrobial agent against oral microorganisms.

TI  == e-test: a new technique for antimicrobial susceptibility testing for periodontal  microorganisms.
AB  == the purpose of the study was to validate the epsilometer test (e-test) method for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of selected periodontopathic microorganisms  using the agar dilution method as a standard. the e-test has been developed to provide a direct quantification of antimicrobial susceptibility of microorganisms. the device consists of a predefined, continuous, and exponential  gradient of antibiotic concentrations immobilized along a rectangular plastic test strip. after 48 hours incubation a drop-shaped inhibition zone intersects the graded test strip at the inhibitory concentration (ic) of the antibiotic. twenty-two subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis sites were plated on trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% rabbit blood or 5% sheep blood and trypticase soy agar supplemented with vancomycin and bacitracin. a total of 60 strains of key periodontal pathogens (prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, and capnocytophaga) isolated from 22 sites of 12 patients were studied. the antibiotics tested were clindamycin, metronidazole, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, cefoxitin, and ampicillin at concentrations above and below the achieved blood or gingival crevicular fluid levels. as a standard reference the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined using the  agar dilution method. mics were compared with ics determined using the e-test method. the results showed an agreement ranging from 67% to 100%; sensitivity ranging from 75% to 100%; predictability ranging from 56% to 100% and specificity ranging from 33% to 96%. the e-test ics for ampicillin, cefoxitin, and metronidazole against the gram-negative capnophilic and microaerophilic rods and  the black-pigmented anaerobic rods ics for ampicillin, clindamycin, metronidazole, and tetracycline showed a high percentage of agreement with the agar dilution mics.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
