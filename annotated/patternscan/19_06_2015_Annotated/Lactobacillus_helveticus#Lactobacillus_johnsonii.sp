TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == characterization of the genome of the dairy lactobacillus helveticus bacteriophage {phi}aq113.
AB  == the complete genomic sequence of the dairy lactobacillus helveticus bacteriophage phiaq113 was determined. phage phiaq113 is a myoviridae bacteriophage with an isometric capsid and a contractile tail. the final assembled consensus sequence revealed a linear, circularly permuted, double-stranded dna genome with a size of 36,566 bp and a g+c content of 37%. fifty-six open reading frames (orfs) were predicted, and a putative function was assigned to approximately 90% of them. the phiaq113 genome shows functionally related genes clustered together in a genome structure composed of modules for dna replication/regulation, dna packaging, head and tail morphogenesis, cell lysis, and lysogeny. the identification of genes involved in the establishment of lysogeny indicates that it may have originated as a temperate phage, even if it was isolated from natural cheese whey starters as a virulent phage, because it is able to propagate in a sensitive host strain.  additionally, we discovered that the phiaq113 phage genome is closely related to  lactobacillus gasseri phage kc5a and lactobacillus johnsonii phage lj771 genomes. the phylogenetic similarities between l. helveticus phage phiaq113 and two phages that belong to gut species confirm a possible common ancestral origin and support the increasing consideration of l. helveticus as a health-promoting organism.

TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

TI  == diversity and mechanisms of alkali tolerance in lactobacilli.
AB  == we determined the maximum ph that allows growth (phmax) for 34 strains of lactobacilli. high alkali tolerance was exhibited by strains of lactobacillus casei, l. paracasei subsp. tolerans, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. curvatus,  l. pentosus, and l. plantarum that originated from plant material, with phmax values between 8.5 and 8.9. among these, l. casei nric 1917 and l. paracasei subsp. tolerans nric 1940 showed the highest phmax, at 8.9. digestive tract isolates of l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. salivarius subsp. salicinius, and l. salivarius subsp. salivarius exhibited moderate alkali tolerance, with phmax values between 8.1 and 8.5. dairy isolates of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and l. helveticus exhibited no alkali tolerance, with phmax values between 6.7 and 7.1. measurement of the internal ph of representative strains revealed the formation of transmembrane proton gradients (deltaph) in a reversed direction (i.e., acidic interior) at alkaline external-ph ranges, regardless of their degrees of alkali tolerance. thus, the reversed deltaph did not determine alkali tolerance diversity. however, the deltaph contributed to alkali tolerance, as the phmax values of several strains decreased with the addition of nigericin, which dissipates deltaph. although neutral external-ph values resulted in the highest glycolysis activity in the presence of nigericin regardless of alkali tolerance,  substantial glucose utilization was still detected in the alkali-tolerant strains, even in a ph range of between 8.0 and 8.5, at which the remaining strains lost most activity. therefore, the alkali tolerance of glycolysis reactions contributes greatly to the determination of alkali tolerance diversity.

TI  == the cell wall of lactic acid bacteria: surface constituents and macromolecular conformations.
AB  == a variety of strains of the genus lactobacillus was investigated with respect to  the structure, softness, and interactions of their outer surface layers in order  to construct structure-property relations of the gram-positive bacterial cell wall. the role of the conformational properties of the constituents of the outer  cell-wall layers and their spatial distribution on the cell wall is emphasized. atomic force microscopy was used to resolve the surface structure, interactions,  and softness of the bacterial cell wall at nanometer-length scales and upwards. the ph-dependence of the electrophoretic mobility and a novel interfacial adhesion assay were used to analyze the average physicochemical properties of the bacterial strains. the bacterial surface is smooth when a compact layer of globular proteins constitutes the outer surface, e.g., the s-layer of l. crispatus dsm20584. in contrast, for two other s-layer containing strains (l. helveticus atcc12046 and l. helveticus atcc15009), the s-layer is covered by polymeric surface constituents which adopt a much more extended conformation and  which confer a certain roughness to the surface. consequently, the s-layer is important for the overall surface properties of l. crispatus, but not for the surface properties of l. helveticus. both surface proteins (l. crispatus dsm20584) and (lipo)teichoic acids (l. johnsonii atcc332) confer hydrophobic properties to the bacterial surface whereas polysaccharides (l. johnsonii dsm20533 and l. johnsonii atcc 33200) render the bacterial surface hydrophilic. using the interfacial adhesion assay, it was demonstrated that hydrophobic groups within the cell wall adsorb limited quantities of hydrophobic compounds. the present work demonstrates that the impressive variation in surface properties displayed by even a limited number of genetically-related bacterial strains can be understood in terms of established colloidal concepts, provided that sufficiently detailed structural, chemical, and conformational information on the surface constituents is available.

TI  == imaging of lactic acid bacteria with afm--elasticity and adhesion maps and their  relationship to biological and structural data.
AB  == the adhesion of lactic acid bacteria to the intestinal epithelium is one of the most important factors determining probiotic ability of a bacterial strain. studying bacterial adhesion requires knowledge of the structure and properties of the bacterial surface, which can be studied by atomic force microscopy under native conditions. the observation of the surface topography of bacteria from the species lactobacillus crispatus, l. helveticus and l. johnsonii shows major differences between bacteria having a crystalline-like protein layer as part of the cell wall and those without such layers. force volume images calculated into  elasticity and adhesion force maps of different bacterial strains show that l. crispatus and l. helveticus have a surface with a homogeneous stiffness with no adhesion events. this is most likely caused by the s-layer, which completely covers the surface of the bacteria. we infer that the absence of adhesion peaks is caused by the semi-crystalline character of such protein layers, in agreement  with the results obtained from electron microscopy. analysis of a number of l. johnsonii strains shows that these bacteria have surface properties which strongly differ from the l. crispatus and l. helveticus strains. for l. johnsonii dms20533 and l. johnsonii atcc33200 high adhesion forces are observed, which can  be related to a surface rich in polysaccharides. l. johnsonii atcc332 has lower adhesion forces compared to the other two and, furthermore, the surface topography shows depressions. we suppose that this strain has a surface pattern consisting of crystalline-like proteins alternating with polysaccharide-rich domains. the wide variety in surface properties of lactobacilli could well have wide-ranging implications for food processing and for health benefits.

TI  == lactobacillus fornicalis sp. nov., isolated from the posterior fornix of the human vagina.
AB  == twelve strains isolated from the posterior fornix fluid of the human vagina were  identified as lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gallinarum and lactobacillus crispatus based on numerical analyses of total soluble cell protein profiles and randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr banding patterns. five strains grouped with the type strains of lactobacillus gasseri (dsm 20077t) and lactobacillus jensenii (dsm 20557t) at r > or = 0.83 in  one protein profile cluster, well separated from the other species included in this study. however, numerical analysis of the rapd-pcr banding patterns of representative strains selected from the l. gasseri-l. jensenii protein cluster clearly indicated that they belong to two different species. four strains (tv 1010, tg 1013, tv 1018t and tv 1045) grouped into another well separated protein  profile cluster at r > or = 0.87. strains selected from this cluster displayed very similar rapd-pcr banding patterns and clustered at r2 > or = 0.78, separate  from the other strains examined. sequencing of the 16s rrna of two representative strains, tv 1018t and tg 1013, of this group indicated that it represents a new member of rrna group i lactobacillus, which includes lactobacillus delbrueckii, the type of the genus, and close relatives lactobacillus acetotolerans, lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, lactobacillus iners, l. jensenii, l. crispatus, l. acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus amylovorus, lactobacillus hamsteri, l. johnsonii, l. gasseri and lactobacillus amylolyticus. the name lactobacillus fornicalis sp. nov. is proposed for strains tv 1010 (dsm 13172), tg 1013, tv 1018t and tv 1045, with strain tv 1018t (= dsm 13171t = atcc 700934t) as the type.

TI  == a polyphasic approach towards the identification of strains belonging to lactobacillus acidophilus and related species.
AB  == a set of 98 strains belonging to nine species of the lactobacillus acidophilus rrna-group have been analysed by sds-page of cellular proteins, rapd-pcr and aflp with fluorescently labeled primers in order to find improved methods for their identification. strains of the following phenotypically highly similar species were examined: l. acidophilus, l. amylovorus, l. crispatus, l. johnsonii, l. gasseri, l. gallinarum, l. helveticus, l. iners and l. amylolyticus. although the majority of the species can be differentiated by sds-page of whole-cell proteins, the latter technique showed poor discrimination between l. gasseri and l. johnsonii strains and between some strains of l. amylovorus and l. gallinarum. however, this study shows that the rapd-pcr (using at least 3 different primers followed by numerical analysis of the combined patterns) and aflp are most suitable genomic fingerprinting techniques for the differentiation of all the species listed above, and that databases for identification can be constructed, particularly when commercially available molecular tool-kits are used. the separate species status of the recently described l. amylolyticus and l. iners was fully confirmed.

TI  == molecular identification of potentially probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == the rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes are useful for the identification of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. crispatus, and l. amylovorus. however, the oligonucleotide probe designed for l. helveticus hybridized with nucleic acids of type strains of l. gallinarum and l. helveticus. hence, the similarity among the 73 strains of lactobacilli was evaluated on the basis of their randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) profiles derived from five single-primer reactions. these strains were grouped into seven clusters at a similarity level of 30%, which corresponded to six separate species of the l. acidophilus complex (l. johnsonii, l. gallinarum, l. amylovorus, l. crispatus, l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri, respectively) and l. helveticus. for the first time, strains of l. gallinarum were characterized by rapd and pfge analyses. the genome length in that species was estimated to be near 1.45 mb with the summation of apai fragments, and near 1.95 mb with the summation of smai fragments.

TI  == the presence of two s-layer-protein-encoding genes is conserved among species related to lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == previously we have shown that the type strain of lactobacillus acidophilus possesses two s-protein-encoding genes, one of which is silent, on a chromosomal  segment of 6 kb. the s-protein-encoding gene in the expression site can be exchanged for the silent s-protein-encoding gene by inversion of this slp segment. in this study the presence of s-protein and corresponding s-protein-encoding genes of strains belonging to species that are closely related to l. acidophilus was determined. all strains investigated were identified by numerical comparison of highly standardized one-dimensional sds-page whole-cellular-protein patterns. western blot and southern blot methods were used to identify the presence of, and homology between, s-proteins and s-protein-encoding genes. from these analyses we conclude that strains of l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. amylovorus and l. gallinarum possess an s-layer and contain two slp genes. strains of l. helveticus possess an s-layer but have only  one intact slp gene. strains of l. gasseri, l. johnsonii and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus have neither an s-layer nor s-protein-encoding genes hybridizing with probes derived from the l. acidophilus slpa or slpb region. the  presence of a highly conserved 5' region in the slp genes of strains of l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. amylovorus and l. gallinarum suggests that s-layer  variation is a common feature for strains of these species.

TI  == expansion of bacteriocin activity and host range upon complementation of two peptides encoded within the lactacin f operon.
AB  == lactacin f is a membrane-active bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus johnsonii vpi11088 (laf+). the genetic determinants encoding lactacin f are organized in a  1-kb polycistronic operon composed of a promoter (p(laf)), three genes (lafa, lafx, and orfz), and a functional rho-independent transcription terminator. two laf- derivatives of vpi11088, designated nck64 and nck65, were characterized. nck64 contained a frameshift mutation in the lafa gene causing premature termination of translation. nck65 harbored a 10-kb chromosomal deletion covering  the laf operon. when the lafa gene was cloned independently and expressed in nck65, bacteriocin activity was limited to l. helveticus 87, only one of the six  known lactacin f-sensitive (lafs) indicators. when lafx was introduced into nck65, no bacteriocin activity against any of the sensitive strains was detected. genetic combination of lafa and lafx, in cis or in trans, restored bacteriocin activity against all lafs indicators. when two nck65 clones containing either lafa or lafx were plated slightly apart on agar plates, fully active lactacin f was present in the intervening area where the two excreted gene products, lafa and lafx, diffused together. the genetic analysis revealed that the interaction of two bacteriocinogenic peptides encoded within the laf operon is likely to participate in the formation of poration complexes in the membranes of susceptible bacteria.

TI  == kinetic studies of the action of lactacin f, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus johnsonii that forms poration complexes in the cytoplasmic membrane.
AB  == the bacteriocin lactacin f is bactericidal against lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus helveticus, and enterococcus faecalis. activity against l. delbrueckii was recently shown to be dependent on two peptides, lafa and lafx, which are encoded within the lactacin f operon (t. r. klaenhammer, fems microbiol. rev. 12:39-87, 1993). it has been proposed that two peptides form an active lactacin f complex. in this study, the action of lactacin f against e. faecalis atcc 19443 and the effects of various environmental parameters were investigated in detail. addition of lactacin f induced the loss of k+ from cells  of l. delbrueckii, lactobacillus johnsonii 88-4, and e. faecalis, while the lactacin f producer l. johnsonii vpi 11088 was not affected by the bacteriocin. lactacin f caused an immediate loss of cellular k+, depolarization of the cytoplasmic membrane, and hydrolysis of internal atp in e. faecalis. lactacin f induced loss of k+ in 3,3',4',5-tetrachlorosalicylanilide-treated cells, indicating that pores are formed in the absence of a proton motive force. atp hydrolysis was not due to dissipation of the proton motive force but was most likely caused by efflux of inorganic phosphate, resulting in a shift of the atp hydrolysis equilibrium. action of lactacin f was optimal at acidic ph values and  was reduced in the presence of di- and trivalent cations. the lanthanide gadolinium (gd3+) prevented action of lactacin f completely at a concentration of 0.2 mm. lactacin f-induced loss of cell k+ was severely reduced at low temperatures, presumably as a result of increased ordering of the lipid hydrocarbon chains in the cytoplasmic membrane.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
