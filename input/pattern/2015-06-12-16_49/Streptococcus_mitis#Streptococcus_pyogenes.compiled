TI  - Antibacterial effects of Traditional Chinese Medicine monomers against Streptococcus pneumoniae via inhibiting pneumococcal histidine kinase (VicK).
AB  - Two-component systems (TCSs) have the potential to be an effective target of the  antimicrobials, and thus received much attention in recent years. VicK/VicR is one of TCSs in Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), which is essential for pneumococcal survival. We have previously obtained several Traditional Chinese Medicine monomers using a computer-based screening. In this study, either alone or in combination with penicillin, their antimicrobial activities were evaluated based on in vivo and in vitro assays. The results showed that the MICs of 5'-(Methylthio)-5'-deoxyadenosine, octanal 2, 4-dinitrophenylhydrazone, deoxyshikonin, kavahin, and dodecyl gallate against S. pneumoniae were 37.1, 38.5, 17, 68.5, and 21 mug/mL, respectively. Time-killing assays showed that these compounds elicited bactericidal effects against S. pneumoniae D39 strain, which led to a 6-log reduction in CFU after exposure to compounds at four times of the MIC for 24 h. The five compounds inhibited the growth of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans or Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, meanwhile, deoxyshikonin and dodecyl gallate displayed strong inhibitory activities against Staphylococcus aureus. These compounds showed no obvious cytotoxicity effects on Vero cells. Survival time of the mice infected by S. pneumoniae strains was prolonged by the treatment with the compounds. Importantly, all of the five compounds exerted antimicrobial effects against multidrug-resistant clinical strains of S. pneumoniae. Moreover, even at sub-MIC concentration, they inhibited cell division and biofilm formation. The five compounds all have enhancement effect on penicillin. Deoxyshikonin and dodecyl gallate showed significantly synergic antimicrobial activity with penicillin in vivo and in vitro, and effectively reduced nasopharyngeal and lung colonization caused by different penicillin-resistant pneumococcal serotypes. In addition, the two compounds also showed synergic antimicrobial activity with erythromycin and tetracycline. Taken together, our results suggest that these novel VicK inhibitors may be promising compounds against the pneumococcus, including penicillin-resistant strains.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of some Thai traditional medical longevity formulations  from plants and antibacterial compounds from Ficus foveolata.
AB  - CONTEXT: Medicinal plants involved in traditional Thai longevity formulations are potential sources of antimicrobial compounds. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antimicrobial activities of some extracts from medicinal plants used in traditional Thai longevity formulations against some oral pathogens, including Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, and Candida albicans. An extract that possessed the strongest antimicrobial activity was fractionated to isolate and identify the active compounds. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methanol and ethyl acetate extracts of 25 medicinal plants used as Thai longevity formulations were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity using disc diffusion (5 mg/disc) and broth microdilution (1.2-2500 microg/mL) methods. The ethyl acetate extract of Ficus foveolata Wall. (Moraceae) stems that exhibited the strongest antibacterial activity was fractionated to isolate the active compounds by an antibacterial assay-guided isolation process. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The ethyl acetate extract of F. foveolata showed the strongest antibacterial activity with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values of 19.5-39.0 and 39.0-156.2 microg/mL, respectively. On the basis of an antibacterial assay-guided isolation, seven antibacterial compounds, including 2,6-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone (1), syringaldehyde (2), sinapaldehyde (3), coniferaldehyde (4), 3beta-hydroxystigmast-5-en-7-one (5), umbelliferone (6), and scopoletin (7), were purified. Among these isolated compounds, 2,6-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone (1) exhibited the strongest antibacterial activities against S. pyogenes, S. mitis, and S. mutans with MIC values of 7.8, 7.8, and 15.6 microg/mL, and MBC values of 7.8, 7.8, and 31.2 microg/mL, respectively. In addition, this is the first report of these antibacterial compounds in the stems of F. foveolata.
TI  - Rapid detection of Gram-positive organisms by use of the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  - Assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. We evaluated the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (BC-GP) in two pediatric hospitals. Positive BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN blood cultures with Gram-positive organisms were tested using the BC-GP in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. To test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 CFU per milliliter. A total of 249 Gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. The BC-GP detected Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%, respectively. The BC-GP detected Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. The BC-GP correctly identified 14/15 cases of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae. It misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with Streptococcus mitis/Streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with Streptococcus anginosus group as S. pneumoniae. The BC-GP detected a case of Streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with Streptococcus agalactiae. BC-GP's rapid accurate detection of Staphylococcus spp., E. faecium, and E. faecalis and its ability to ascertain mecA, vanA, and vanB status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining to optimal antibiotic use. False-positive S. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "Streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the BC-GP.
TI  - [Clinical course of acute respiratory infection and the state of microbiocenosis  of upper respiratory tract in pregnant women].
AB  - AIM: Evaluate clinical features of the course of acute respiratory infection (ARI) and the state of microbiocenosis of nasopharynx of pregnant women at gestational term of 14 - 26 weeks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: At the stage of outpatient therapy of ARI 49 pregnant women at the gestational term of 14 - 26 weeks were examined: group 1--27 individuals consulting at day 1 and receiving Viferon (gel) intranasally for 10 days, group 2--22 individuals consulting at day 2 - 3 and receiving Viferon (gel and suppositorium). Respiratory viral infection was diagnosed by multiplex PCR. Bacteriologic study of discharge from the middle section of the pharynx was performed by the standard technique. RESULTS: ARI in group 1 of pregnant women were regarded as mild severity and persisted for an average of 3 days. In group 2 in 13 (59%) of patients ARI of moderate severity was noted and the recovery occurred at day 6. Pyo-inflammatory diseases of ENT organs appeared in 10 (45.4%) of patients. Respiratory infections were determined in 16 (32.7%) of them: coronaviruses--in 5 (10.2%), rhinoviruses--in 3 (6.2%), respiratory syncytial viruses--in 6 (12.3%), parainfluenza (type 2) and influenza A viruses--1 (2%) both, without significant differences between the observed groups. Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mitis, Moraxella catarrhalis, Corynebacterium spp., Streptococcus pyogenes with the predominance of the latter in 36.7% and 60% of cases, respectively, in pregnant women of the group 2 (p < 0.01), were detected in the microflora of the mucous membrane of the nasopharynx. CONCLUSION: Viferon preparation therapy prescribed at day 1 of outpatient visit of pregnant women may promote mild course o fARI and prophylaxis of complications of upper respiratory tract.
TI  - Exploring internal features of 16S rRNA gene for identification of clinically relevant species of the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus is an economically important genus as a number of species belonging to this genus are human and animal pathogens. The genus has been divided into different groups based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. The variability observed among the members of these groups is low and it is difficult to distinguish them. The present study was taken up to explore 16S rRNA gene sequence to develop methods that can be used for preliminary identification and can supplement the existing methods for identification of clinically-relevant isolates of the genus Streptococcus. METHODS: 16S rRNA gene sequences belonging to the isolates of S. dysgalactiae, S. equi, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. bovis, S. gallolyticus, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. mitis, S. pneumoniae, S. thermophilus and S. anginosus were analyzed with the purpose to define genetic variability within each species to generate a phylogenetic framework, to identify species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. RESULTS: The framework based analysis was used to segregate Streptococcus spp. previously identified upto genus level. This segregation was validated using species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. 43 uncharacterized Streptococcus spp. could be identified using this approach. CONCLUSIONS: The markers generated exploring 16S rRNA gene sequences provided useful tool that can be further used for identification of different species of the genus Streptococcus.
TI  - Streptococcus
AB  - The genus Streptococcus , a heterogeneous group of Gram-positive bacteria, has broad significance in medicine and industry. Various streptococci are important ecologically as part of the normal microbial flora of animals and humans; some can also cause diseases that range from subacute to acute or even chronic. Among the significant human diseases attributable to streptococci are scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, glomerulonephritis, and pneumococcal pneumonia. Streptococci are essential in industrial and dairy processes and as indicators of pollution. The nomenclature for streptococci, especially the nomenclature in medical use, has been based largely on serogroup identification of cell wall components rather than on species names. For several decades, interest has focused on two major species that cause severe infections: S pyogenes (group A streptococci) and S pneumoniae (pneumococci). In 1984, two members were assigned a new genus - the group D enterococcal species (which account for 98% of human enterococcal infections) became Enterococcus faecalis (the majority of human clinical isolates) and E faecium (associated with a remarkable capacity for antibiotic resistance). In recent years, increasing attention has been given to other streptococcal species, partly because innovations in serogrouping methods have led to advances in understanding the pathogenetic and epidemiologic significance of these species. A variety of cell-associated and extracellular products are produced by streptococci, but their cause-effect relationship with pathogenesis has not been defined. Some of the other medically important streptococci are S agalactiae (group B), an etiologic agent of neonatal disease; E faecalis (group D), a major cause of endocarditis, and the viridans streptococci. Particularly for the viridans streptococci, taxonomy and nomenclature are not yet fully reliable or consistent. Important members of the viridans streptococci, normal commensals, include S mutans and S sanguis (involved in dental caries), S mitis (associated with bacteremia, meningitis, periodontal disease and pneumonia), and "S milleri" (associated with suppurative infections in children and adults). There remains persistent taxonomic confusion regarding "S milleri." These and other streptococci of medical importance are listed inTable 13-1by serogroup designation, normal ecologic niche, and associated disease.
TI  - Salivaricin 9, a new lantibiotic produced by Streptococcus salivarius.
AB  - Salivaricin 9 (Sal9) is a 2560 Da lantibiotic having just 46 % amino acid identity with its closest known homologue, the Streptococcus pyogenes lantibiotic SA-FF22. The Sal9 locus (designated siv) in Streptococcus salivarius strain 9 was partially sequenced and localized to an approximately 170 kb megaplasmid, which also harbours the locus for the lantibiotic salivaricin A4. The entire locus was fully characterized in the draft genome sequence of S. salivarius strain JIM8780 and shown to consist of eight genes, having the following putative functions: sivK, sensor kinase; sivR, response regulator; sivA, Sal9 precursor peptide; sivM, lantibiotic modification enzyme; sivT, ABC transporter involved in the export of Sal9 and concomitant cleavage of its leader peptide; and sivFEG, encoding lantibiotic self-immunity. Intriguingly, in contrast to strain 9, the siv locus was chromosomally located in strain JIM8780--the first lantibiotic locus shown not to be exclusively plasmid-associated in S. salivarius. Sal9-containing extracts specifically induced lantibiotic production in both strain 9 and strain JIM8780, indicating that Sal9 functions as a signal peptide for upregulation of its own biosynthesis. Screening representative strains of three streptococcal species (S. salivarius, S. pyogenes and S. mitis) for sivA indicated that it was present only in S. salivarius, with 12 of 28 tested S. salivarius positive. Since Sal9 was inhibitory to all tested S. pyogenes strains it appears to have potential as an important component of the bacteriocin armoury of S. salivarius probiotics intended to control S. pyogenes infections of the human oral cavity.
TI  - Mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  - The oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. When this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. Generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. The mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. Several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the Streptococcus (Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis) and Staphylococcus (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Porphyromonas gingivalis. In addition, some members of both the Streptococcus and the Staphylococcus genera, as well as Porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. The current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. The pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.
TI  - Comparative genomics and transduction potential of Enterococcus faecalis temperate bacteriophages.
AB  - To determine the relative importance of temperate bacteriophage in the horizontal gene transfer of fitness and virulence determinants of Enterococcus faecalis, a panel of 47 bacteremia isolates were treated with the inducing agents mitomycin C, norfloxacin, and UV radiation. Thirty-four phages were purified from culture supernatants and discriminated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and restriction mapping. From these analyses the genomes of eight representative phages were pyrosequenced, revealing four distinct groups of phages. Three groups of phages, PhiFL1 to 3, were found to be sequence related, with PhiFL1A to C and PhiFL2A and B sharing the greatest identity (87 to 88%), while PhiFL3A and B share 37 to 41% identity with PhiFL1 and 2. PhiFL4A shares 3 to 12% identity with the phages PhiFL1 to 3. The PhiFL3A and B phages possess a high DNA sequence identity with the morphogenesis and lysis modules of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris prophages. Homologs of the Streptococcus mitis platelet binding phage tail proteins, PblA and PblB, are encoded on each sequenced E. faecalis phage. Few other phage genes encoding potential virulence functions were identified, and there was little evidence of carriage of lysogenic conversion genes distal to endolysin, as has been observed with genomes of many temperate phages from the opportunist pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. E. faecalis JH2-2 lysogens were generated using the eight phages, and these were examined for their relative fitness in Galleria mellonella. Several lysogens exhibited different effects upon survival of G. mellonella compared to their isogenic parent. The eight phages were tested for their ability to package host DNA, and three were shown to be very effective for generalized transduction of naive host cells of the laboratory strains OG1RF and JH2-2.
TI  - Partial recN gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - Partial sequences of the recN gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. The partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. The mean DNA sequence similarity of recN gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be lower than those of the 16S rRNA gene (94.1 %), rpoB (84.6 %), sodA (74.8 %), groEL (78.1 %) and gyrB (73.2 %). Phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: Streptococcus salivarius, S. equinus, S. hyovaginalis/S. pluranimalium/S. thoraltensis, S. pyogenes, S. mutans and S. suis. The 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: Streptococcus sanguinis/S. cristatus/S. sinensis, S. anginosus/S. intermedius/S. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and S. mitis/S. infantis/S. peroris/S. oralis/S. oligofermentans/S. pneumoniae/S. pseudopneumoniae. The partial recN gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. This observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groEL, gyrB, rpoB and sodA). A high percentage of similarity was found between S. intermedius and S. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recN gene. To study the genetic diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recN, groEL, sodA, gyrB and rpoB sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. The results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.
TI  - Differentiation of Streptococcus pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak isolates by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus [Pnc]) is a causative agent of many infectious diseases, including pneumonia, septicemia, otitis media, and conjunctivitis. There have been documented conjunctivitis outbreaks in which nontypeable (NT), nonencapsulated Pnc has been identified as the etiological agent. The use of mass spectrometry to comparatively and differentially analyze protein and peptide profiles of whole-cell microorganisms remains somewhat uncharted. In this report, we discuss a comparative proteomic analysis between NT S. pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak strains (cPnc) and other known typeable or NT pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates (including Pnc TIGR4 and R6, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes) and nonstreptococcal isolates (including Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus) as controls. cPnc cells and controls were grown to mid-log phase, harvested, and subsequently treated with a 10% trifluoroacetic acid-sinapinic acid matrix mixture. Protein and peptide fragments of the whole-cell bacterial isolate-matrix combinations ranging in size from 2 to 14 kDa were evaluated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Additionally Random Forest analytical tools and dendrogramic representations (Genesis) suggested similarities and clustered the isolates into distinct clonal groups, respectively. Also, a peak list of protein and peptide masses was obtained and compared to a known Pnc protein mass library, in which a peptide common and unique to cPnc isolates was tentatively identified. Information gained from this study will lead to the identification and validation of proteins that are commonly and exclusively expressed in cPnc strains which could potentially be used as a biomarker in the rapid diagnosis of pneumococcal conjunctivitis.
TI  - A quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. This can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. In this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. METHODS: Fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. Microorganisms were enumerated and identified. Bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated PBS solution for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. RESULTS: Counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) CFU. Candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. No obligate anaerobes were isolated. Members of Streptococcaceae family were regularly found (65.2%) belonging to the following species: Streptococcus pyogenes, S. mutans, S. mitis, S. oralis, S. sobrinus, S. viridans, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Aerococcus viridans. A. viridans and S. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis were found on adults brushes. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp. and Enterococcus sp., were also recovered. We found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. However, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. Decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. CONCLUSIONS: Ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. Maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.
TI  - A functional epitope of the pneumococcal surface adhesin A activates nasopharyngeal cells and increases bacterial internalization.
AB  - Pneumococcal surface adhesin A (PsaA) is a putative pneumococcal (Pnc) adhesin known to bind to nasopharyngeal (NP) epithelial cells. This study evaluated the effect of peptides within a functional domain of PsaA on NP cells. Detroit 562 NP cells were treated with synthetic peptides derived from PsaA (P4, P6, and P7; 28, 12, and 16 amino acids, respectively). The P4 peptide also binds to NP cells. Analysis of P4-treated NP cells by transmission electron microscopy revealed major cytological changes. Of 9 cytokines analyzed, a 6-fold increase in FGFb secretion at 3 and 6h (11-fold at 12h) was found post-P4 treatment of NP cells. There was a simultaneous reduction in the secreted levels of IL-6, IL-8, and VEGF. We observed enhancement in the adherence of Pnc strains to P4-treated NP cells (2-38-fold increase). Enhancement in adherence (2-fold increase) to P4-treated NP cells was also recorded with other streptococcal species (Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus pyogenes). Internalization experiments demonstrated that 45% of the adherent bacteria were actually internalized after pretreatment with P4 peptide as compared to controls. Peptide fragments of P4, P6 and P7 did not activate NP cells to the extent of P4 peptide. The P4-mediated enhancement of Pnc adherence was blocked (100%) by anti-P4 antibodies, confirming the specificity of the P4 sequence for NP cell activation. Our data suggests that this functional domain of PsaA contained within the P4 sequence binds and activates NP cells to facilitate Pnc invasion.
TI  - Surviving streptococcal toxic shock syndrome: a case report.
AB  - Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and associated myositis caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus pyogenes generally have a poor outcome despite aggressive operative treatment. Frequently the diagnosis is missed initially as the clinical features are non-specific. The progression to a toxic state is rapid and unless definitive treatment measures are initiated early, the end result can be catastrophic. We report a previously healthy patient who had features of toxic shock syndrome due to alpha haemolytic (viridans) streptococcus mitis which was treated successfully with antibiotics, aggressive intensive care support including the use of a 'sepsis care bundle', monitoring and continuous multidisciplinary review. Life and limb threatening emergencies due to streptococcus mitis in an immune-competent person are rare and to our knowledge, have not previously been described in the English scientific literature. Successful outcome is possible provided a high degree of suspicion is maintained and the patient is intensively monitored.
TI  - [A tenacious lameness in a 2-year-old child].
AB  - Spondylodiscitis, a septic infection of the intervertebral disc Spondylodiscitis, a septic infection of the intervertebral disc and adjacent vertebrae, is an unusual infection, mainly affecting children and elderly people. It is classically associated with tuberculosis, but other germs such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes or mitis, and some even more unususal ones (e.g. Kingella kingae), are often encountered in our countries. Non tuberculous spondylodiscitis is found in approximately 2% of pediatric bone infections. Medullar compression and bone destruction can occur, especially when diagnosis is delayed, hence the value of early diagnosis and treatment. We report the case of a non tuberculous spondylodiscitis occurring in a 22 month-old baby
TI  - Identification of a novel streptococcal gene cassette mediating SOS mutagenesis in Streptococcus uberis.
AB  - Streptococci have been considered to lack the classical SOS response, defined by  increased mutation after UV exposure and regulation by LexA. Here we report the identification of a potential self-regulated SOS mutagenesis gene cassette in the Streptococcaceae family. Exposure to UV light was found to increase mutations to antibiotic resistance in Streptococcus uberis cultures. The mutational spectra revealed mainly G:C-->A:T transitions, and Northern analyses demonstrated increased expression of a Y-family DNA polymerase resembling UmuC under DNA-damaging conditions. In the absence of the Y-family polymerase, S. uberis cells were sensitive to UV light and to mitomycin C. Furthermore, the UV-induced mutagenesis was almost completely abolished in cells deficient in the Y-family polymerase. The gene encoding the Y-family polymerase was localized in a four-gene operon including two hypothetical genes and a gene encoding a HdiR homolog. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that S. uberis HdiR binds specifically to an inverted repeat sequence in the promoter region of the four-gene operon. Database searches revealed conservation of the gene cassette in several Streptococcus species, including at least one genome each of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Streptococcus thermophilus strains. In addition, the umuC operon was localized in several mobile DNA elements of Streptococcus and Lactococcus species. We conclude that the hdiR-umuC-ORF3-ORF4 operon represents a novel gene cassette capable of mediating SOS mutagenesis among members of the Streptococcaceae.
TI  - Macrolide resistance can be transferred by conjugation from viridans streptococci to Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Efflux pumps encoded by mef genes are among the most common mechanisms of resistance to macrolides. These genes are often located on horizontally transferable elements such as transposons. We present data indicating conjugative transfer of the mef(E) gene from viridans streptococci to the pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes. The mef(E) gene is located on the previously described MEGA (macrolide efflux genetic assembly) element. Of 110 isolates tested, 85% of those that carried the mef(A/E) gene carried it on MEGA, and in all cases of conjugal transfer of the mef(E) gene it was carried on MEGA. It therefore appears reasonable to draw the conclusion that this element is important in the lateral transfer of macrolide resistance between streptococci.
TI  - rpoB gene sequence-based identification of aerobic Gram-positive cocci of the genera Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Gemella, Abiotrophia, and Granulicatella.
AB  - We developed a new molecular tool based on rpoB gene (encoding the beta subunit of RNA polymerase) sequencing to identify streptococci. We first sequenced the complete rpoB gene for Streptococcus anginosus, S. equinus, and Abiotrophia defectiva. Sequences were aligned with these of S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, and S. pneumoniae available in GenBank. Using an in-house analysis program (SVARAP), we identified a 740-bp variable region surrounded by conserved, 20-bp zones and, by using these conserved zones as PCR primer targets, we amplified and sequenced this variable region in an additional 30 Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Gemella, Granulicatella, and Abiotrophia species. This region exhibited 71.2 to 99.3% interspecies homology. We therefore applied our identification system by PCR amplification and sequencing to a collection of 102 streptococci and 60 bacterial isolates belonging to other genera. Amplicons were obtained in streptococci and Bacillus cereus, and sequencing allowed us to make a correct identification of streptococci. Molecular signatures were determined for the discrimination of closely related species within the S. pneumoniae-S. oralis-S. mitis group and the S. agalactiae-S. difficile group. These signatures allowed us to design a S. pneumoniae-specific PCR and sequencing primer pair.
TI  - Genomic organization and molecular characterization of SM1, a temperate bacteriophage of Streptococcus mitis.
AB  - The direct binding of Streptococcus mitis to human platelets is mediated in part  by two proteins (PblA and PblB) encoded by a lysogenic bacteriophage (SM1). Since SM1 is the first prophage of S. mitis that has been identified and because of the possible role of these phage-encoded proteins in virulence, we sought to characterize SM1 in greater detail. Sequencing of the SM1 genome revealed that it consisted of 34,692 bp, with an overall G+C content of 39 mol%. Fifty-six genes encoding proteins of 40 or more amino acids were identified. The genes of SM1 appear to be arranged in a modular, life cycle-specific organization. BLAST analysis also revealed that the proteins of SM1 have homologies to proteins from a wide variety of lambdoid phages. Bioinformatic analyses, in addition to N-terminal sequencing of the proteins, led to the assignment of possible functions to a number of proteins, including the integrase, the terminase, and two major structural proteins. Examination of the phage structural components indicates that the phage head may assemble using stable multimers of the major capsid protein, in a process similar to that of phage r1t. These findings indicate that SM1 may be part of a discrete subfamily of the Siphoviridae that includes at least phages r1t of Lactococcus lactis and SF370.3 of Streptococcus pyogenes.
TI  - Major outbreak of toxic shock-like syndrome caused by Streptococcus mitis.
AB  - Severe illness caused by viridans streptococci rarely occurs in immunocompetent hosts. Between December 1990 and May 1991, thousands of patients in the YangZi River Delta area of Jiangsu Province, China, suffered from scarlet fever-like pharyngitis. Fewer cases occurred in subsequent years with the same seasonality. Approximately half of the cases developed complications characteristic of streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome (TSLS). Throat cultures yielded predominant growth of alpha-hemolytic streptococci. All cases admitted to Haian People's Hospital were investigated. Clinical specimens were collected, medical records were reviewed, and bacterial isolates were identified phenotypically and analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Proteins were purified from culture supernatants by extraction, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and fast-protein liquid chromatography. Biological activities of protein components were determined by subcutaneous inoculation into rabbits. A total of 178 cases of non-beta-hemolytic streptococcal scarlet fever-like pharyngitis were studied. In 88 (79.3%) of 111 patients, oropharyngeal swab cultures grew morphologically identical alpha-hemolytic streptococci. A protein in culture supernatants was pyrogenic in rabbits, was mitogenic for splenocytes, and enhanced rabbit susceptibility to endotoxin challenge. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of this 34-kDa protein showed no homology with known Streptococcus pyrogenic exotoxins. The organism was identified as Streptococcus mitis based on biochemical and 16S rRNA sequence analyses. Representative outbreak isolates from 1990 to 1995 displayed identical PFGE patterns. This TSLS outbreak in southeastern China was caused by a toxigenic clone of S. mitis. An apparently novel toxin may explain the unusual virulence of this organism.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci: report from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (1997-2000).
AB  - Susceptibility patterns of 15 antimicrobial agents were assessed for 3,400 isolates of beta-hemolytic (betahS) and viridans group (VgS) streptococci in the four regions of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program: Asia-Pacific (APAC), Europe (EU), Latin America (LA) and North America (NA). In 1997 through 2000, SENTRY Program monitors tested strains by reference broth microdilution methods and results were interpreted using National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards criteria. Among the betahS processed, 81.9% of strains were either Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 650) or S. agalactiae (n = 1,190). The VgS were generally classified as unspeciated alpha-hemolytic streptococci (n = 512; 44%) or S. mitis (n = 254; 22%). Seven quinolones, two beta-lactams, erythromycin (ER), clindamycin (CM), quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D), vancomycin (VA), teicoplanin (TP) and linezolid (LZ) were tested. Rank order of susceptibility for betahS isolates was: ceftriaxone (CTX) = Q/D = VA = TP = LZ (100.0%) > gatifloxacin (GATI) = trovafloxacin (TROV, 99.8%) > levofloxacin (LEVO; 99.7%) > penicillin (PEN; 99.3%) > grepafloxacin (GREPA; 97.4%) > CM (94.4%) > ER (85.5%). ER versus betahS had the highest MIC(90) values (2 microg/ml) and the lowest susceptibility rates across all regions (range, 81.4% in NA to 97.3% in LA). Among the VgS, susceptibility rank order was: VA = TP = LZ (100.0%) > Q/D (99.1%) > GATI = LEVO = TROVA (98.0%) > GREPA (96.5%) > CTX (92.8%) > CM (90.3%) > PEN (68.6%) > ER (64.5%). Macrolide resistance in both streptococcal species groups of the M-phenotype was highest in the Americas, with erm-patterns predominating in EU and APAC regions. BMS284756 among the monitored new agents showed a four- to eight-fold greater potency versus these streptococcal isolates when compared to the other six tested quinolones. Like Streptococcus pneumoniae, these other streptococci appear to have acquired numerous resistances and require continued surveillance to direct adequate therapies.
TI  - A XerD recombinase with unusual active site motifs in Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - XerD belongs to the site specific recombinases of the integrase family of proteins that catalyze recombination events via a phosphotyrosine intermediate. Sequence alignments and crystal structure resolution of E. coli XerD and related enzymes demonstrated the importance of four conserved amino acids R-H-R-H that are spaced along the C-terminal domain in addition to a conserved K and the active site Y, all of which have been implicated in catalysis. The deduced amino acid sequence of the putative S. pneumoniae XerD contained three unique replacements at the conserved positions resulting in L-Q-R-L; moreover, the active site Y was the penultimate amino acid residue, and the extreme C-terminal region suggested to be involved in interaction of E. coli XerD with XerC was lacking. Severe growth defects in a loss-of-function xerD mutant are consistent with an important in vivo function of the S. pneumoniae XerD protein. Highly related xerD genes with similar unusual amino acid replacements were found in S. mitis, S. mutans and S. pyogenes but not in other Gram-positive bacteria, although the genetic environment was very similar in many species. There are at least another four genes in the S. pneumoniae KNR_7/87 genome encoding Xer related peptides, one of which was identified as the xerC homologue. The xerD and xerC genes were present in a sample of 20 S. pneumoniae strains whereas the other xer genes appear to be absent in some of the strains and are more closely related to integrases of phage and transposon origin.
TI  - Nationwide German multicenter study on the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in streptococcal blood isolates from neutropenic patients and comparative in vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin and eight other antimicrobials.
AB  - In a prospective multicenter study (1996 to 1999), 156 episodes of bacteremic streptococcal infections of neutropenic patients were evaluated. Streptococcus oralis (26.3%), S. pneumoniae (26.3%), S. agalactiae (11.5%), S. mitis (9%), and S. pyogenes (5.8%) were the predominant species. Four strains (2.6%) were found to be intermediately resistant to penicillin. One strain (0.6%) was found to be highly resistant to penicillin (MIC, 8 mg/liter). Reduced susceptibility to penicillin was detected among S. oralis (14.6%), S. mitis (7.1%), and S. pneumoniae (4.9%) isolates but was not recorded among S. agalactiae and S. pyogenes. Resistance rates and intermediate resistance rates for other antimicrobials were as follows (all species): amoxicillin, 1.3 and 3.2%; erythromycin, 16 and 2.6%; clindamycin, 5.8 and 0%; ciprofloxacin, 1.9 and 7.7%. Quinupristin-dalfopristin showed good in vitro activity against most streptococcal isolates (MIC at which 50% of the isolates were inhibited [MIC(50)], 0.5 mg/liter; MIC(90), 1 mg/liter, MIC range, 0.25 to 4 mg/liter).
TI  - [Phenotypes of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin resistant Streptococcus  viridans isolated from blood].
AB  - Macrolide resistance has been widely studied in Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae although not in viridans group streptococci (VGS). We studied 30 blood culture isolates of viridans group streptococci (25 resistant to erythromycin: 10 S. mitis, 8 S. milleri, 6 S. sanguis and 1 S. salivarius; and 5 susceptible: 2 S. mitis, 2 S. milleri and 1 S. sanguis). We carried out a double-disk test and determined MICs. The susceptibility testing was carried out by agar dilution for 14-, 15- and 16-member lactone ring macrolides, as well as for clindamycin and quinupristin-dalfopristin. Fifty-six percent of the erithromycin-resistant strains (6 S. mitis, 6 S. milleri and 2 S. sanguis) showed an MLS(B) phenotype, with a high level of intrinsic resistance to all the macrolides studied and clindomycin; 28&#37; were of the M phenotype (4 S. sanguis, 2 S. mitis and 1 S. salivarius). We found a third resistance phenotype, which was present in 4 strains with MICs of 2-8 microg/ml, with resistance to macrolides and different degrees of resistance to clindamycin. All isolates were fully susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. The MLS(B) and M phenotypes initially described in S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae are also observed in VGS.

AB  - Macrolide resistance has been widely studied in Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae although not in viridans group streptococci (VGS). We studied 30 blood culture isolates of viridans group streptococci (25 resistant to erythromycin: 10 S. mitis, 8 S. milleri, 6 S. sanguis and 1 S. salivarius; and 5 susceptible: 2 S. mitis, 2 S. milleri and 1 S. sanguis).

TI  - [The classification of streptococci and human streptococcal diseases].
AB  - The modern nomenclature, phenotypic, medical, ecological and phylogenetic classification of streptococci and different classification of streptococcal human diseases are presented. All phylogenetic groups of streptococci have been shown to contain species causing diseases in man. The most medically significant groups are the phylogenetic groups Pyogenes and Mitis. Directions of the improvement of the classification of streptococci and streptococcal human diseases on the basis of modern concepts on the taxonomy of streptococci, the biological properties and ecology of the infective agents, as well as the genesis and clinical picture of diseases induced by them, have been determined.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 Gram-positive microorganisms. The MIC(90) (mg/L) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus anginosus and Actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for Streptococcus sanguis and Listeria monocytogenes, 2 for Corynebacterium jekeium and Bifidobacterium bivius. Over 50% of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, quinolone-resistant staphylococci, Nocardia steroides and Clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/L moxifloxacin. Moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards Gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against Gram-positive bacilli.
TI  - Streptococcal histone induces murine macrophages To produce interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha.
AB  - The histone-like protein (HlpA) is highly conserved among streptococci. After lysis of streptococci in infected tissues, HlpA can enter the bloodstream and bind to proteoglycans in the glomerular capillaries of kidneys, where it can react with antibodies or stimulate host cell receptors. Deposits of streptococcal antigens in tissues have been associated with localized acute inflammation. In this study, we measured the ability of purified HlpA (5 to 100 microg/ml), from Streptococcus mitis, to induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines by cultured, murine peritoneal macrophages. The release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) was time and concentration dependent and was not diminished by the presence of polymyxin B. Exposure of macrophages to a mixture of HlpA and lipoteichoic acid resulted in a synergistic response in the production of both TNF-alpha and IL-1. Stimulation with a mixture of HlpA and heparin resulted in reduced cytokine production (50% less IL-1 and 76% less TNF-alpha) compared to that by cells incubated with HlpA alone. The inclusion of antibodies specific to HlpA in macrophage cultures during stimulation with HlpA did not affect the quantity of TNF-alpha or IL-1 produced. These observations suggest that streptococcal histone may contribute to tissue injury at infection sites by promoting monocytes/macrophages to synthesize and release cytokines that initiate and exacerbate inflammation. Streptococcus pyogenes, which can infect tissues in enormous numbers, may release sufficient amounts of HlpA to reach the kidneys and cause acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.
TI  - Streptococcal meningitis in adult patients: current epidemiology and clinical spectrum.
AB  - Streptococci other than Streptococcus pneumoniae are a rare cause of bacterial meningitis in adults. We report 29 cases of streptococcal meningitis (1977-1997). The patients comprised 19 men and 10 women, with a mean age +/- standard deviation of 47 +/- 18 years. Nine cases were secondary to neurosurgical procedures, seven to brain abscess, five to cerebrospinal fluid pericranial fistula, and three to endocarditis. Causative microorganisms included the following: viridans group streptococci, 20 cases; anaerobic streptococci, 3; Streptococcus agalactiae, 3; Streptococcus bovis, 2; and Streptococcus pyogenes, 1. Four Streptococcus mitis strains showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin (MIC, 0.5-2 microg/mL). Five patients (17%) died. The infection is increasing in the hospital setting. Streptococci resistant to penicillin should be considered in the empirical treatment of nosocomial meningitis. In cases of community-acquired infection, anaerobic streptococci or streptococci of the Streptococcus milleri group should alert the clinician to the presence of an undiagnosed brain abscess, whereas oral streptococci of the viridans group suggest the diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis.
TI  - Increased interleukin-6, interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor-alpha production by tonsillar mononuclear cells stimulated with alpha-streptococci in patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris.
AB  - In vitro cytokine production by tonsillar mononuclear cells under culture conditions with or without lyophilized streptococcal antigens was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Under culture conditions without any stimulus, a certain amount of interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interleukin (IL)-6, was detected in the supernatant culture fluids from all 29 donors tested and just detectable levels of IL-1alpha and IL-2 were identified in 5 of 12 donors tested; but IL-4 and IL-5 were not detected in any supernatants from 21 donors tested. In 16 patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (PPP), all three alpha-streptococcal antigens from Streptococcus, (S.) sanguis, S. salivarius and S. mitis induced production of IL-6. IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha by tonsillar mononuclear cells at a significant level. However, no significant induction of such cytokines by alpha-streptococcal stimulus was seen in 13 donors without PPP. No significant difference in cytokine production by tonsillar mononuclear cells was seen between the PPP and non-PPP subjects, when stimulated with S. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I and pokeweed mitogen. In the experiments using tonsillar cell subsets, the cytokine inductions by alpha-streptococcal stimulus were found in monocyte-depleted cells as well as in purified T-cells. but not in B-cells. These data suggest that IL-6, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha may play an important role in immunological reactions in the tonsils and that a hyper-immune response to some of alpha-streptococcal antigens through increased production of such cytokines by tonsillar mononuclear cells, to which T-cells mainly contribute, may play a key role in the pathogenesis of PPP.
TI  - [Analysis of serum antibodies to alpha-streptococci in patients with tonsil-related pustulosis palmaris et plantaris].
AB  - To determine the systemic immune response to alpha-streptococci (Str. sanguis, Str. salivarius and Str. mitis) and beta streptococcus (Str. pyogenes T12) in patients with tonsil related pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (PPP), we measured serum antibody levels to whole cell body antigens of Streptococcus (Str.) sanguis, Str. salivarius, Str. mitis or Str. pyogenes by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The serum IgG antibody levels to alpha-streptococci, Str. sanguis and Str. salivarius were significantly higher in patients with PPP (n = 44) than in patients with recurrent tonsillitis (RT: n = 25) and in healthy adults (n = 17). Serum antibody IgG level to Str. pyogenes was not different among the 3 groups. The IgA antibody levels against any Streptococcus strain were not different among the 3 groups. The IgM antibody levels to Str. pyogenes were significantly higher in patients with RT than in patients with PPP. In western blot analysis, the serum IgG antibodies against 25-27 kDa protein from whole cell body of Str. sanguis, Str. salivarius and Str. mitis were found more frequently in patients with PPP than in healthy adults. However, the western blot profile in Str. pyogenes was not different between PPP and healthy adults. No significant difference was seen in the western blot profile of IgM or IgM antibodies to any streptococcal whole cell bodies. These data suggest that systemic hyper immune response to alpha-streptococci may be present in patients with tonsil-related PPP and the 25-27 kDa protein of the organism may be the target for this immunologic abnormality.
TI  - Identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  - We have used a PCR assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (sodA(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (S. acidominimus, S. agalactiae, S. alactolyticus, S. anginosus, S. bovis, S. constellatus, S. canis, S. cricetus, S. downei, S. dysgalactiae, S. equi subsp. equi, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, S. equinus, S. gordonii, S. iniae, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguis, S. pneumoniae, S. porcinus, S. pyogenes, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus, S. suis, S. thermophilus, and S. vestibularis). Phylogenetic analysis of these sodA(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16S rRNA sequences. We have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their sodA(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the sodA(int) fragments of the type species. We propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin against Gram-positive bloodstream isolates.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, rifampicin, imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 414 bloodstream isolates of Gram-positive cocci. Quinupristin-dalfopristin inhibited strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae at 0.12 mg/L, methicillin- and/or erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at 0.5 mg/L, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus anginosus at 1 mg/L and Enterococcus faecalis at 8 mg/L.
TI  - Evaluation of swirling, pH, and glucose tests for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although infrequent, episodes of transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis may lead to serious outcomes or death and therefore are of concern. This study evaluates the sensitivity of three surrogate tests for the presence of bacteria in platelet concentrates: cessation of swirling, low extracellular pH, and low plasma glucose levels. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Day 0 platelet concentrates were inoculated with low levels of one of seven bacterial strains and stored with agitation at 20 to 24 degrees C for up to 5 days. In the morning and afternoon of each day of storage, bacterial levels were ascertained by quantitative plate culture, and platelet concentrates were tested for platelet pH, plasma glucose, and swirling. Quantitative and semiquantitative dipstick techniques were used to determine pH and glucose levels. RESULTS: Platelet concentrates had attained stationary phase growth of Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus mitis, or Staphylococcus epidermidis (> or = 10(7) -10(8) colony-forming units [CFU]/mL) before either the swirling or dipstick methods suggested the presence of bacteria. The sensitivity of swirling and glucose tests for detecting bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates was generally comparable. Although the sensitivity of the pH test was generally similar to that of swirling and glucose tests for most bacteria, platelet concentrates contaminated with E. cloacae had normal pH despite the presence of high levels of bacteria (> or = 10(7)-10(8) CFU/mL). CONCLUSION: The sensitivity in detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates by the swirling technique or by measuring extracellular pH or plasma glucose is less than the sensitivity reported for microscopy with Gram stain (10(5)-10(6) CFU/mL), fluorescence microscopy with acridine orange stain (10(4)-10(5) CFU/mL), chemiluminescence detection of ribosomal RNA (10(3)-10(4) CFU/mL), and automated bacterial culture (1 CFU/sample volume).
TI  - Rapid identification of Streptococcus and Enterococcus species using diffuse reflectance-absorbance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and artificial neural networks.
AB  - Diffuse reflectance-absorbance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was used to analyse 19 hospital isolates which had been identified by conventional means to one Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, Streptococcus bovis, S. mitis, S. pneumoniae, or S. pyogenes. Principal components analysis of the FT-IR spectra showed that this 'unsupervised' learning method failed to form six separable clusters (one of each species) and thus could not be used to identify these bacteria base on their FT-IR spectra. By contrast, artificial neural networks (ANNs) could be trained by 'supervised' learning (using the back-propagation algorithm) with the principal components scores of derivatised spectra to recognise the strains from their FT-IR spectra. These results demonstrate that the combination of FT-IR and ANNs provides a rapid, novel and accurate bacterial identification technique.
TI  - Cross-reactivity between human sialyl Lewis(x) oligosaccharide and common causative oral bacteria of infective endocarditis.
AB  - The expression of sialy-Lewis(x) (sLe(x); Neu5Ac alpha 2-3 Gal beta 1-4) (Fuc alpha 1-3) GlcNAc-R) on oral bacteria producing infective endocarditis was determined by a whole-cell enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and an immunoelectron microscopy using the well-characterized anti-sLe(x) monoclonal antibody SNH-3 (mAb SNH-3; IgM class). mAb SNH-3 reacted strongly with whole cells of oral bacteria: Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens and Porphyromonas gingivalis. The negatively stained immuno-electron micrograph of Streptococcus pyogenes showed many reactive gold particles on the cell surface. Our findings demonstrated the existence of immunologic mimicry between the sLe(x) oligosaccharide and cell surface antigens of many species associated with infective endocarditis. We propose the hypothesis that if these bacteria escape their normal habitats, the surface components that mimic the sLe(x) oligosaccharide might bind to host antigens of the selectin family which could promote binding to endothelial cells and, consequently, initiation of the events leading to infective endocarditis.
TI  - Bacterial interference in vitro. Comparison between a quantitative kinetic and a  cocultivation blood agar test method.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to compare two methods for estimation of bacterial growth interference between various bacteria using a Bioscreen robot analyzer, allowing kinetic documentation, and a cocultivation test on blood agar plates. Six laboratory strains with different virulence and growth requirements were used: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus mitis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The interference activity was correlated with a reference system of Streptococcus sanguis (strain alpha 89) and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococci, GAS serotypes T 9 and T 22). The methods used and results obtained were as follows: 1. Estimation of synergistic and antagonistic bacterial interferences using a Bioscreen robot analyzer. Suspensions of viable bacteria were added to microtiter plates with different concentrations of UV light-killed bacteria in liquid media. The Bioscreen analyzer monitored bacterial growth every 10 min for 24 h giving kinetic data during the growth period. Synergisms as well as antagonisms were demonstrated between the tested bacterial strains which have not earlier been reported in the literature. However, the antagonistic effect observed between the six strains was less than that induced by the S. sanguis strain on the two strains of S. pyogenes. 2. Cocultivation of bacterial strains on blood agar surface with precultivated or simultaneously stamped interfering bacteria indicated no detectable interference between the six tested bacterial strains, while the S. sanguis strain inhibited the growth of S. pyogenes strains as well as the hemolysis around the colonies. The Bioscreen method was found more sensitive for testing bacterial interference compared to the commonly used blood agar test.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of streptococci isolated from blood from neutropenic patients.
AB  - MICs were performed on 62 streptococci isolated from the blood of neutropenic patients from 1986 to 1992 using the NCCLS broth microdilution procedure. Species isolated were 43 S. mitis, 6 S.pneumoniae, 5 S.sanguis, 1 S.pyogenes, 1 beta-hemolytic streptococcus of the group G, 1 S.adjacens, 1 S.intermedius, 4 not identified isolates (2 alpha-hemolytic, 1 non-hemolytic and 1 nutritionally variant strains). 26% of all strains were resistant or intermediate to penicillin (MIC 90: 2 mg/l) and 89% to norfloxacine (MIC 90: 32 mg/l). All were susceptible to vancomycin. Among cephalosporins, all strains were susceptible to cefotaxime (MIC 90: 1 mg/l), ceftriaxone (MIC 90: 1 mg/l) and cefepime (MIC 90: 2 mg/l) while 19% were R or I to ceftazidime (MIC 90: 16 mg/l). All were susceptible to imipenem (MIC 90: 0.5 mg/l) and meropenem (MIC 90: 1 mg/l). Among the third generation cephalosporins, ceftazidime--the agent of this class of antibiotics that is most often used for the empirical therapy of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients (in combination but also in monotherapy)--has a high resistance rate as compared to the other compounds.
TI  - [Calcified aortic stenosis due to healed experimental bacterial endocarditis].
AB  - We studied the role of bacterial endocarditis in the development of aortic valve  stenosis. A femoral arterio venous shunt was performed in nine dogs with the method previously proposed by Lillehei. We induced bacteremic infection with the administration of streptococcus mitis (1 x 10(10)) 10 ml once a day for 15 days these bacterium were sensible to penicillin. All dogs were treated with 1,000,000 U of benzatinic penicillin and sacrificed between 28-102 days after the bacterial inoculation ended. In one dog we observed bacterial endocarditis in the mitral and aortic valves and in other three dogs there was an aortic valve stenosis with calcium deposits in the body and in the free edges of the aortic valve with evident irregular stenosis as seen in man.
TI  - [Antibacterial and cytotoxic effects of N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate used as a tissue  adhesive].
AB  - In this study, the antibacterial and cytotoxic effects of a synthetic tissue adhesive called n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (Histoacryl) which provide rapid healing in incision in oral surgical procedures were investigated. The antibacterial effects of Histoacryl were tested by using standard reference strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mitis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus grown in Mueller-Hinton media (sheep blood supplemented Mueller-Hinton for streptococcus strains) by diffusion technique. The cytotoxic effects were also researched on continuous Vero and primary gingival fibroblast cell cultures by using agar overlay method. In these methods, the inhibition zones produced by Histoacryl were evaluated. As a result, Histoacryl was found to have antibacterial effect on the tested bacteria and produce cytotoxic and cytopathic effects on the tested cell cultures.
TI  - [In vitro bactericidal effect of temafloxacin and tosufloxacin against streptococci].
AB  - Tosufloxacin tosylate (TOSU) and temafloxacin hydrochloride (TEMA) were tested in vitro against 248 clinical isolates of various species of streptococci recovered in a hospital microbiology laboratory (Bellevue Regional Teaching Hospital). Species included S. pneumoniae (n = 20), group A streptococci (n = 22), group B streptococci (n = 30), group G streptococci (n = 17), group D S. bovis (n = 19), Enterococcus faecium (n = 45), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 28), S. sanguis (n = 21), S. milleri (n = 29) and S. mitis (n = 17). Activities of each of the two study drugs were evaluated comparatively with two other fluoroquinolones, i.e., ciprofloxacin (CIP) and pefloxacin (PEF). Activities of each of these four antibiotics, expressed as the MIC 90%, varied as follows according to the species of streptococci: TOSU, 0.25 to 1 mg/l, TEMA 0.5 to 2 mg/l, CIP, 1 to 4 mg/l and PEF 8 to 32 mgl. Overall, TOSU and TEMA exhibited the greatest activity of the various species. The size of the inoculum had no significant effect on MIC values.
TI  - Streptococcus mitis and ARDS in neutropenic patients.
AB  
TI  - [2 newborn infants with septicemia caused by multiresistant Streptococcus mitis].
AB  - Multiresistant viridans streptococci had not yet been encountered in the Netherlands. In the spring of 1990 we isolated multiresistant S. mitis from blood of two Dutch neonates (minimal inhibitory concentration of penicillin 64 mg/l). In both patients septicaemia developed while they were being treated with beta-lactam antibiotics. Although viridans streptococci usually are extremely sensitive to penicillin and other beta-lactams, the possibility of development of (multi-)resistance in these microorganisms during antibiotic treatment should be kept in mind.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal properties of propylene glycol, hexylene glycol, and 1,3-butylene glycol in vitro.
AB  - The antimicrobial properties of three glycols, - propylene glycol, hexylene glycol, and 1,3-butylene glycol - against Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes A, Streptococcus mitis, and E. coli were studied in vitro. Within 20 h, 10% and 30% hexylene glycol in fresh tryptic soy broth were able to kill all the micro-organisms listed above. Five percent hexylene glycol showed some antimicrobial properties but the 1% agent had no effect. Thirty percent 1,3-butylene glycol and 30% propylene glycol were approximately as effective as 10% HG. The results speak in favour of using hexylene glycol in cosmetic and dermatological vehicles instead of propylene glycol and 1,3-butylene glycol.
TI  - [Investigation of the immune response in tonsillar lymphocytes against streptococci in patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris].
AB  - The purpose of this study was to clarify the etiological role of immune responses in tonsillar lymphocytes of the patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (PPP). In order to determine their immune response to S. pyogenes T4, S. pyogenes T12, S mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis I, S. sanguis II and S. pneumoniae, tonsillar lymphocytes from patients with PPP, CT, and sleep apnea syndrome (control) were cultured with formalinized streptococcal cellular antigens. Blastoid transformation was investigated by [3H] -thymidine uptake, while antistreptococcal antibody production were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results were as follows. 1. Tonsillar lymphocytes from PPP patients underwent blastoid transformation and accelerated the production of immunoglobulin G following the addition of S. sanguis I, S. sanguis II S. mitis, S. pyogenes T4, and S. pyogenes T12, while those form CT patients and controls did so only with S. pyogenes T4 and S. pyogenes T12. 2. The spontaneous production of specific IgG against various streptococci, including S. sanguis I, S. sanguis II and S. mitis by tonsillar lymphocytes from patients with PPP was already higher than that from CT patients and controls. The specific IgM production was also increased above that in PPP patients without any antigens. 3. S. sanguis I, S. sanguis II and S. salivarius antigens stimulated antigen-specific IgM production in tonsillar lymphocytes from PPP patients. 4. The levels of specific IgG production against S. sanguis I and S. sanguis II by tonsillar lymphocytes from PPP patients showed a relationship with the serum levels of the PPP patients. These results suggested that the sensitization of alpha-streptococci, especially S. sanguis, in the tonsillar lacunae may lead to the specific production of anti-S. sanguis antibodies in patients with PPP, and these may be involved in the pathogenesis of PPP.
TI  - [Investigation of the bacterial flora in the tonsillar lacunae and serum levels of streptococcal antigen-specific antibodies in patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris].
AB  - The purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship between bacterial flora in tonsillar lacunae and antistreptococcal antibody in sera of the patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (PPP). Since the pustules develops or worsens after tonsillitis in many patients with PPP, a pathogenic role of tonsillar bacteria is suggested, but no significant association has been proven so far. In this study, the aerobes in the tonsillar lacunae were identified and quantitated in 15 adult patients with PPP and 9 adult patients with chronic tonsillitis (CT). In addition, serum streptococcal antigen-specific antibody levels in 40 adult patients with PPP, 18 adult patients with chronic tonsillitis, and 11 healthy volunteers (controls) were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results were as follows. 1. A total of 53 strains (17 species) of aerobes were isolated and identified from the tonsillar lacunae in patients with PPP, while 35 strains (12 species) of aerobes were found in the patients with CT. 2. S. salivarius and S. pneumoniae were the dominant aerobes isolated from patients with PPP or CT. 3. Although the rates of isolation for Staphylococcus and S. pneumoniae were lower in PPP patients than in CT patients, the rate for S. sanguis I was higher in PPP patients than in CT patients. 4. The percentage of alpha, gamma-streptococci to total aerobes in PPP patients was higher than in CT patients. 5. The IgG antibody titers against S. sanguis and S. mitis, and the IgM antibody titers against all streptococci investigated in PPP patients were higher than those in both CT patients and controls. 6. Moreover, both the IgG antibody titers against S. pyogenes T4 and S. sanguis I and the IgM antibody titers against S. sanguis I and S. sanguis II of the patients in which PPP markedly improved after tonsillectomy were higher than those in which PPP showed less improvement postoperatively.
TI  - Diphtheria among alcoholic urban adults. A decade of experience in Seattle.
AB  - Three outbreaks of Corynebacterium diphtheriae infection occurred in Seattle's Skid Road from 1972 through 1982. The first involved a single toxigenic, intermedius biotype clone, whereas the second and third outbreaks involved nontoxigenic mitis and gravis strains. Of 1100 total infections, 947 (86%) were cutaneous. The incidence was highest in winter and spring. In Skid Road, the estimated attack rate during 17 months in 1974 to 1975 was 5% for whites and 27% for native Americans. Streptococcus pyogenes was isolated from 73% of diphtheritic and 41% of nondiphtheritic skin lesions (P less than 0.001). Skin infection and environmental contamination by C. diphtheriae were correlated. Complications occurred in 21% of symptomatic nasopharyngeal and 3% of cutaneous toxigenic intermedius infections (P less than 0.001), and were significantly correlated with ages 60 years or more. Preferential use of erythromycin for diphtheria and pyodermas preceded plasmid-mediated resistance to erythromycin in C. diphtheriae. Diphtheria outbreaks in urban alcoholic persons are associated with poor hygiene, crowding, season, contaminated fomites, underlying skin disease, hyperendemic streptococcal pyoderma, and introduction of new strains from exogenous reservoirs.
TI  - Rapid detection of Bordetella pertussis by a monoclonal antibody-based colony blot assay.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies to Bordetella pertussis filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were used in a colony blot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay designed for rapid detection of B. pertussis. Bacterial colonies from Bordet-Gengou agar plates were blotted onto nitrocellulose filter disks, lysed by immersion in chloroform, and reacted with monoclonal antibodies. Following reaction with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin antisera and 4-chloro-1-naphthol, blue dots representing single colonies appeared on the filters. Blotting of single B. pertussis colonies could be performed after incubation for 40 h, i.e., before the colonies were visible by eye on the agar surface. Ten of ten B. pertussis strains showed positive blotting reactions with antibodies specific for B. pertussis FHA and LPS. Fourteen of fourteen B. parapertussis strains reacted with two of the FHA-specific antibodies but not with two of the LPS-specific antibodies. Strains of B. bronchiseptica showed a variable reaction pattern. No cross-reactions were observed with strains of Streptococcus mitis, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Branhamella catarrhalis, or Klebsiella pneumoniae. This assay may be useful for identification of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis in suspected cases of whooping cough.
TI  - Binding of laminin to oral and endocarditis strains of viridans streptococci.
AB  - Attachment of bacteria to the host tissue is regarded as a crucial step in the development of many types of infections. Recent studies by us and others have shown that matrix proteins which serve as adhesion proteins for eucaryotic cells may also be recognized by some bacteria. In the present communication, we report that several strains of viridans streptococci are able to bind to laminin. Most strains isolated from blood and heart valves of patients with endocarditis expressed laminin receptors, whereas only a few of the strains isolated from the oral cavity recognized this protein. This observation indicates that laminin binding might be an important factor in the pathogenesis of viridans endocarditis. Laminin binding to two strains (Streptococcus mitis UAB594 and UAB597) isolated from patients with endocarditis was characterized further. The bacterial cells expressed a limited number of laminin receptors (4 X 10(2) to 1 X 10(3) per cell) which bound the protein in a high-affinity interaction (Kd, 40 to 80 nM). This receptor of S. mitis UAB594 was heat labile and could be solubilized from bacteria by brief digestion with trypsin. Solubilized receptors which competed with cell-bound receptors for 125I-laminin could be adsorbed on laminin-Sepharose but not on Sepharose substituted with fibrinogen or fibronectin. Comparison of laminin receptors from S. mitis with those previously described for Streptococcus pyogenes suggest that different sites in the laminin molecule are recognized by the two bacteria and hence that the corresponding receptor molecules are not identical.
TI  - Molecular genetics of resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin B  (MLS) in streptococci.
AB  - Resistance to macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin B (MLS phenotype) appears in  almost all streptococcal species isolated from man. Genes coding for MLS resistance are located on plasmids and one MLS resistance transposon has been described. MLS resistance genes have also been found in a large number of plasmid-free strains. Plasmids of 17 to 20 megadaltons (Mdal) that code either for MLS or for both MLS and chloramphenicol resistance are found in streptococci of groups A, B, C, D (Streptococcus faecalis) and G. These plasmids have broad host ranges (conjugative intraspecies, interspecies and intergeneric transfer), display similar restriction enzyme patterns and share a considerable degree of homology (78 to 95%). One smaller non-conjugative MLS resistance plasmid has been isolated from Str. sanguis (4.5 Mdal). In group D (Str. faecalis, Str. faecium) streptococci, MLS resistance genes are also found on plasmids that carry other antibiotic resistance (tetracycline, chloramphenicol, high-levels of streptomycin and kanamycin). These multi-resistance plasmids are either conjugative or non-conjugative and are of various sizes and molecular species and those that have been tested have narrow host-ranges. The MLS resistance genes of one multi-resistant plasmid, isolated from a strain of Str. faecalis, are located on a transposon of 3.3 Mdal, Tn917. Hybridization studies, with MLS determinants as probes, reveal homologies among various plasmid-borne MLS resistance sequences. Elements that are thought to be chromosome-borne mediate multiple antibiotic resistance (including MLS) in streptococci of groups A, B, C, D (Str. bovis), F, G, Str. pneumoniae, Str. mitis, Str. sanguis and Str. milleri. Strains harbouring such elements contain no detectable plasmid DNA. In some of the strains these elements are conjugative; their resistance markers transfer en bloc at low frequency and display narrow host ranges. Such elements, from Str. pyogenes and Str. agalactiae, were found to translocate onto various streptococcal haemolysin-bacteriocin plasmids.
TI  - The aerobic bacteriology of infected skin lesions in children of the Eastern Highlands Province.
AB  - Of 480 children studied, the relative frequency of skin infections divided into three categories were: score 266 (55%), infected scabies 164 (34%) and tropical ulcers 50 (10%). Infected scabies was more prevalent in the less than 2 year age group and tropical ulcers were commonest in the 9-12 year age group and these differences were significant. The majority of lesions occurred on the lower extremities with the trunk the least commonly affected area. No significant differences were found in different age groups between males and females. Beta haemolytic streptococci (95%), Staphylococcus aureus (83%), Corynebacterium diphtheriae (72%) and Corynebacterium haemolyticum (35%) were the major bacteria isolated. Beta haemolytic streptococci were the most prevalent in infected scabies and least in tropical ulcers and these differences were significant. Three major Lancefield groups were isolated: group A (61%), group C (19%) and group G (19%). The distribution of these groups were unequal with group A most common in infected scabies but rarely seen in tropical ulcers. Groups C and G were found more commonly in tropical ulcers than the other two groups of lesions and these differences were significant. Multiple populations of beta haemolytic streptococci in a single lesion were seen in 19% of children. Less than one third of Streptococcus pyogenes were M typable and of these 18% were known nephritogenic serotypes. Staphylococcus aureus was significantly more common in infected scabies and least common in tropical ulcers. The prevalence of Vincent's organisms in tropical ulcers (74%) was significantly higher than scores (9%) and infected scabies (1%). The isolation rate of Corynebacterium diphtheriae was significantly higher in infected scabies than the other two groups. The most common biotype isolated was var mitis (72%). Only 2% of isolates were toxigenic. Corynebacterium haemolyticum was isolated significantly more frequently in tropical ulcers than the other lesions. All major bacteria, excluding betalactamase-producing Straphylococcus aureus, were uniformly sensitive to penicillin. Methicillin resistance was found in 1% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates and is reported here for the first time in this country. These isolates were also multiply resistant to erythromycin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Exogenous thymidine and reversal of the inhibitory effect of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim on streptococci.
AB  - The practice of using sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SXT) for the selective isolation of Streptococcus pyogenes and as a taxonomic character in the presumptive identification of streptococci was applied to 17 strains of different groups of streptococci to determine their characteristic behaviour in the presence of exogenous thymidine. Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and group D enterococci utilized thymidine, the first two species obtaining a maximum reversal of the inhibitory effect of SXT at thymidine concentrations of 1.2 micrograms/ml and 0.6 micrograms/ml or higher, respectively. For group D enterococci, the degree of reversal of the inhibitory effect was proportional to the thymidine concentration. In contrast, the four viridans species studied (Streptococcus sanguis I, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis II) and Streptococcus pneumoniae were unable to utilize thymidine from an exogenous source and thus growth remained inhibited even at the highest concentrations of thymidine tested. For selective isolation and identification of streptococci only stable media with batch-to-batch consistency are recommended together with a known quantity of thymidine.
TI  - A-16686, a new antibiotic from Actinoplanes. II. Biological properties.
AB  - A-16686, a new glycoproteide antibiotic obtained from fermentation of an Actinoplanes strain, is active against Gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic bacteria; MIC values ranged from 0.016 to 2.0 micrograms/ml. A-16686 is bactericidal for growing cells of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecium, S. mutans, S. mitis and S. sanguis. There is no cross-resistance with clinically used antibiotics. A-16686, administered subcutaneously, is very effective in experimental S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae septicemias in the mouse.
TI  - Species distribution of non-group D alpha-hemolytic streptococci in maternal genital and neonatal blood cultures.
AB  - At our hospital (Jefferson Davis Hospital, Houston, Tex.) since 1979, non-group D alpha-hemolytic streptococci have been isolated with increasing frequency from neonatal blood cultures with clinical findings of sepsis. A total of 47 such isolates were identified to the species level by the scheme of Facklam and were compared with 57 genital isolates from 167 maternity patients. Among the genital isolates, S. sanguis II and S. MG-intermedius accounted for 53 and 28%, respectively, and both were significantly less common in neonatal cultures (23 and 11%, respectively; P less than 0.05). Among neonatal isolates, S. mitis was the single most frequent species (35%), in contrast to its rare occurrence in maternal cultures (3.4%; P less than 0.001). The disparity between the prevalence of S. mitis in neonatal compared with maternal cultures suggests that this species of non-group D alpha-hemolytic streptococci may have increased virulence in neonatal hosts.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide-mediated antagonism against serratia marcescens by Streptococcus mitis.
AB  - The alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus mitis strain no. 17-1, isolated from the oral cavity of an healthy female adult, antagonized the growth of all 24 test strains of Serratia marcescens examined; furthermore, this strain inhibited the growth of various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae. However, strans of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved refractory. The mechanism of microbial antagonism was due to production and release of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic atmospheric conditions, which was neutralized through incorporation of bovine liver catalase into the solid assay medium.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Streptococcus.
AB  - A numerical taxonomic study of strains of Streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. The major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (S. faecalis, S. faecium, 'S. avium' and a proposed new species 'S. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (S. bovis, S. equinus, S. salivarius, 'S. casseliflavus', S. mutans, S. raffinolactis and an unidentified Oral Group I); (c) lactic species group (S. lactis including S. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (S. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (S. mitis, S. sanguis, a proposed new species 'S. oralis' and 'S. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. equi, 'S. equisimilis' including 'S. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of Lancefield Group B strains of human origin); (g) parapyogenic species group (S. uberis, 'S. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of Lancefield Groups R, S and T). Species of Aerococcus, Gemella, Leuconostoc and Pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
TI  - Epidemiologic studies among Amerindian populations of Amazonia. I. Pyoderma: prevalence and associated pathogens.
AB  - Pyoderma was studied among a representative sample of the residents of four remote Amerindian villages, Amazonas State, Brazil, during July-August 1976. The overall prevalence among the 775 inhabitants examined was 11%, with little intervillage variation. When the attack rates for the entire sample population were calculated by 5-year age intervals, the 0- to 4-year-olds had the highest rate, 31%. The highest prevalence, 38%, was found among 3-year-olds. Attack rates were not apparently related to sex. Cultures which were taken from representative pyoderma lesions from people in the four survey villages and from three additional villages were studied by a modified delayed culture technique for recovery of gram-positive pathogens from silica-gel desiccated swabs. Group A and group G B-hemolytic streptococci, coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae were isolated. Group A S. pyogenes was most commonly found, occasionally as the sole pathogenic species. No nephritogenic M-types were found, although most isolates were not M-typable. The T-types found corresponded to those previously reported as being pyoderma-associated. Most pyoderma-associated C. diphtheriae isolates were non-toxigenic. Biotypes gravis and mitis were equally represented.
TI  - Contribution to the taxonomy of haemolytic corynebacteria.
AB  - In an attempt to assess the taxonomic relationships among human (Corynebacterium  haemolyticum), animal (Corynebacterium pyogenes bovis) haemolytic corynebacteria, typical corynebacteria (Corynebacterium diphteriae mitis, C. ovis, C. ulcerans) and group A and G streptococci, a number of biochemical parameters were established: the DNA content of G + C, the presence of the cytochrome system, composition of fatty acids in free lipids and production of carboxylic acids as end products of fermentation. It was found that according to the above criteria, streptococci differed significantly from the corynebacteria studied. In addition, it was possible to differentiate a subgroup of typically aerobic haemolytic corynebacteria (different from both human and animal corynebacteria), possessing a complete cytochrome system, producing propionic acid and having a different composition of fatty acids.
TI  - Adherence of Veillonella species mediated by extracellular glucosyltransferase from Streptococcus salivarius.
AB  - The effect of extracellular products from Streptococcus salivarius on sucrose-dependent adherence to smooth surfaces by other oral bacteria was studied in vitro. Strains of Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Veillonella parvula without innate ability to adhere to a steel wire were able to do so when incubated with sucrose and cell-free culture fluid from S. salivarius strains 9759, 25975, CNII, and MEPI. These culture fluids synthesized more adherent material and water-insoluble glucan than those from Streptococcus mutans C67-1 and seven other S. salivarius strains. Among the S. salivarius strains, glucosyltransferase (GT; dextransucrase, EC 2.4.1.5) activity varied more than 100-fold. Cells of Veillonella and S. mitis S3 that had been incubated in culture fluids from S. salivarius 25975 and 9759, respectively, and then washed adhered upon subsequent incubation with sucrose. This was due to adsorbed GT because (i) the adherence was sensitive to dextranase; (ii) it was observed only with the high-GT culture fluids; (iii) it was dependent on sucrose; and (iv) the washed Veillonella cells synthesized glucan, but not fructan, from sucrose. These results suggest that sucrose-dependent adherence of bacteria without such innate ability can be mediated by (i) entrapment in insoluble glucan synthesized by S. salivarius culture fluids, and (ii) prior adsorption of GT from S. salivarius culture fluids. The possibility that GT formed by high-yield strains of S. salivarius is distributed through the mouth by the action of salivary flow and contributes to sucrose-dependent adherence and plaque formation is considered.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of a peroxidogenic strain of Streptococcus mitior (mitis).
AB  
TI  - Proportional distribution and relative adherence of Streptococcus miteor (mitis)  on various surfaces in the human oral cavity.
AB  - A group of streptococci possessing the characteristics of Streptococcus miteor (S. mitis) was found to predominate on nonkeratinized human oral mucosa. These organisms averaged from 76 to 89% of the total flora cultivable on anaerobically incubated blood agar plates from cheek, lip, and ventral tongue surfaces. They averaged 34, 40, and 18% of the streptococci in dental plaque, in saliva, and on the tongue dorsum, respectively. Their ability to adhere to oral surfaces was studied by introducing mixtures of streptomycin-resistant strains of S. miteor, S. salivarius, and S. mutans into the mouths of volunteers. Samples of oral surfaces taken 1 hr later indicated S. miteor adhered far better than the other streptococci to buccal mucosa and to teeth, but S. salivarius showed a higher affinity to the tongue dorsum. Glucose-grown cells of S. mutans adhered feebly to all oral surfaces studied and were rapidly cleared from the mouth. Cells of S. miteor and S. salivarius present naturally in saliva adhered to cleaned teeth comparable to in vitro cultivated strains. Electron microscopy of cells of S. miteor attached to buccal epithelial cells obtained from germfree rats indicated that the organisms possessed a fibrillar "fuzzy" coat which appeared to mediate their attachment to the epithelial cell membrane. This "fuzzy" coat was removed by treatment with trypsin, and it appears to be similar to that previously observed on cells of S. pyogenes and S. salivarius.
TI  - Cores, microbial organelles possibly specific to group D streptococci.
AB  - A long, thin, approximately cylindrical core spans the interior of cells of 24-hr cultures of all group D streptococci that were examined, five strains of Streptococcus faecalis, single strains of S. faecalis subsp. zymogenes and S. durans, and three strains of Streptococcus spp. In one strain of S. faecalis, serial section electron microscopy showed that most cells possess a core. The core is 0.10 to 0.16 mum thick and consists of a matrix and an axial array of ribosomelike particles. It resembles one of two types of cores present in a stable protoplast form of one of the S. faecalis strains. Cores were not present in single strains of S. pyogenes (beta-hemolytic group A), S. agalactiae (group B), S. dysgalactiae (group C), S. equisimilis (group C), and S. mitis (viridans group) that were examined; nor were cores observed in single strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus megaterium. Cores may be useful, therefore, in identification of group D streptococci. For preservation and rapid recognition of cores, a glutaraldehyde-osmium tetroxide sequence of fixation appears superior to the osmium tetroxide method often employed in processing bacteria for electron microscopy.
TI  - Production of endocarditis with Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus mitis in  dogs with aortic insufficiency.
