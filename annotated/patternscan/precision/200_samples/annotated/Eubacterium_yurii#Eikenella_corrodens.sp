TI == susceptibility of anaerobic microorganisms to hypothiocyanite produced by lactoperoxidase.
AB == the susceptibility of capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, eubacterium yurii, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, selenomonas sputigena, wolinella recta to hypothiocyanite (oscn-) produced by the lactoperoxidase system was tested. results showed a decrease of bacterial survival rate after oscn- exposure, with an intra- and inter-species variability from 0 to 95% for c. ochracea, 34-100% for e. corrodens, 0-83% for e. yurii, 1-15% for f. nucleatum, 8-61% for p. micros, 0-100% for p. intermedia, 0-44% for s. sputigena and 0-8% for w. recta. the survival rate did not correlate with the nadh/oscn- oxidoreductase activity present in the lysed bacteria (r = -0.3248; n = 15; ns).
