TI  == comparative in vitro activities of smt19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  == the comparative in vitro activity of smt19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined clostridium difficile strains, 174 gram-positive and 136 gram-negative intestinal anaerobes,  and 40 gram-positive aerobes. smt19969 was one dilution more active against c. difficile isolates (mic range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; mic90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; mic90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. smt19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against gram-negative anaerobes, especially the bacteroides fragilis group species, than  vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that smt19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. smt19969 showed limited activity against other gram-positive anaerobes, including bifidobacteria species, eggerthella lenta, finegoldia magna, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with mic90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with c. innocuum being susceptible (mic90, 1 mug/ml) and c. ramosum and c. perfringens being nonsusceptible (mic90, >512 mug/ml). activity against lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; mic90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. gram-positive aerobic cocci (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococci) showed high smt19969 mic90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and  penicillins. fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa; n = 127), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa; n = 123), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), enterococcus faecium (n = 50), enterococcus avium (n = 50), and peptostreptococcus spp. (p. anaerobius, p. asaccharolyticus, p. magnus, p. micros, p. prevotii; n = 125). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also  observed with ceftazidime (caz), cpr, cfpm, fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. the decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual mic range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.
