TI  - Antimicrobial activity of diterpenes from Viguiera arenaria against endodontic bacteria.
AB  - Six pimarane-type diterpenes isolated from Viguiera arenaria Baker and two semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro against a panel of representative microorganisms responsible for dental root canal infections. The microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella buccae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides fragilis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Enterococcus faecalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. The compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid, its sodium salt and ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol were the most active, displaying MIC values ranging from 1 to 10 mug mL-1. The results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new chemicals for use as a complement to instrumental endodontic procedures.
TI  - Prevotella bergensis sp. nov., isolated from human infections.
AB  - Eight strains of anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli isolated from infections of the  skin and soft tissues were subjected to a comprehensive range of phenotypic and genotypic tests. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed the strains to constitute a homogeneous group, distinct from species with validly published names but related to a cluster including Prevotella buccae, Prevotella dentalis and Prevotella baroniae. A novel species, Prevotella bergensis sp. nov., is proposed to accommodate these strains. Prevotella bergensis is saccharolytic and produces acetic and succinic acids as end products of fermentation. The G + C content of the DNA of the type strain is 48 mol%. The type strain of Prevotella bergensis is 94067913T (= DSM 17361T = CCUG 51224T).
