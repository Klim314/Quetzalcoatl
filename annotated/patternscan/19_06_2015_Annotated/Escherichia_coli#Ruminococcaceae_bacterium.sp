TI  == investigation of bacterial diversity in the feces of cattle fed different diets.
AB  == the objective of this study is to investigate individual animal variation of bovine fecal microbiota including as affected by diets. fecal samples were collected from 426 cattle fed 1 of 3 diets typically fed to feedlot cattle: 1) 143 steers fed finishing diet (83% dry-rolled corn, 13% corn silage, and 4% supplement), 2) 147 steers fed late growing diet (66% dry-rolled corn, 26% corn silage, and 8% supplement), and 3) 136 heifers fed early growing diet (70% corn silage and 30% alfalfa haylage). bacterial 16s rrna gene amplicons were determined from individual fecal samples using next-generation pyrosequencing technology. a total of 2,149,008 16s rrna gene sequences from 333 cattle with at  least 2,000 sequences were analyzed. firmicutes and bacteroidetes were dominant phyla in all fecal samples. at the genus level, oscillibacter, turicibacter, roseburia, fecalibacterium, coprococcus, clostridium, prevotella, and succinivibrio were represented by more than 1% of total sequences. however, numerous sequences could not be assigned to a known genus. dominant unclassified  groups were unclassified ruminococcaceae and unclassified lachnospiraceae that could be classified to a family but not to a genus. these dominant genera and unclassified groups differed (p < 0.001) with diets. a total of 176,692 operational taxonomic units (otu) were identified in combination across all the 333 cattle. only 2,359 otu were shared across 3 diet groups. unifrac analysis showed that bacterial communities in cattle feces were greatly affected by dietary differences. this study indicates that the community structure of fecal microbiota in cattle is greatly affected by diet, particularly between forage- and concentrate-based diets.

TI  == sewage reflects the distribution of human faecal lachnospiraceae.
AB  == faecal pollution contains a rich and diverse community of bacteria derived from animals and humans, many of which might serve as alternatives to the traditional  enterococci and escherichia coli faecal indicators. we used massively parallel sequencing (mps) of the 16s rrna gene to characterize microbial communities from  wastewater treatment plant (wwtp) influent sewage from 12 cities geographically distributed across the usa. we examined members of the clostridiales, which included the families clostridiaceae, lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae for their potential as sewage indicators. lachnospiraceae was one of the most abundant groups of faecal bacteria in sewage, and several lachnospiraceae high-abundance sewage pyrotags occurred in at least 46 of 48 human faecal samples. clone libraries targeting clostridium coccoides (c. coccoides) in sewage samples demonstrated that lachnospiraceae-annotated v6 pyrotags encompassed the previously reported c. coccoides group. we used oligotyping to profile the genus  blautia within lachnospiraceae and found oligotypes comprised of 24 entropy components that showed patterns of host specificity. these findings suggest that  indicators based on blautia might have the capacity to discriminate between different faecal pollution sources. development of source-specific alternative indicators would enhance water quality assessments, which leads to improved ecosystem health and reduced human health risk due to waterborne disease.

TI  == identification and characterization of potential performance-related gut microbiotas in broiler chickens across various feeding trials.
AB  == three broiler feeding trials were investigated in order to identify gut bacteria  consistently linked with improvements in bird performance as measured by feed efficiency. trials were done in various geographic locations and varied in diet composition, broiler breed, and bird age. gut microbial communities were investigated using microbial profiling. eight common performance-linked operational taxonomic units (otus) were identified within both the ilea (180, 492, and 564-566) and ceca (140-142, 218-220, 284-286, 312, and 482) across trials. otu 564-566 was associated with lower performance, while otus 140-142, 482, and 492 were associated with improved performance. targeted cloning and sequencing of these eight otus revealed that they represented 26 bacterial species or phylotypes which clustered phylogenetically into seven groups related  to lactobacillus spp., ruminococcaceae, clostridiales, gammaproteobacteria, bacteroidales, clostridiales/lachnospiraceae, and unclassified bacteria/clostridia. where bacteria were identifiable to the phylum level, they belonged predominantly to the firmicutes, with bacteroidetes and proteobacteria also identified. some of the potential performance-related phylotypes showed high sequence identity with classified bacteria (lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus aviarius, lactobacillus crispatus, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, escherichia coli, gallibacterium anatis, clostridium lactatifermentans, ruminococcus torques, bacteroides vulgatus, and alistipes finegoldii). the 16s rrna gene sequence information generated will allow quantitative assays to be developed which will enable elucidations of which of these phylotypes are truly performance related. this information could be used to monitor strategies to improve feed efficiency and feed formulation for optimal gut health.

TI  == molecular cloning and characterization of a novel sgnh arylesterase from the goat rumen contents.
AB  == an esterase-encoding gene, estr5, was directly obtained from the genomic dna of goat rumen contents. the 555-bp full-length gene encodes a 184-residue polypeptide (estr5) without putative signal peptide. deduced estr5 shared the highest identity (50%) to a putative arylesterase from ruminococcaceae bacterium  d16. phylogenetic analysis indicated that estr5 was closely related with microbial esterases of gastrointestinal source. a comparison of the conserved motifs shared with gdsl proteins revealed that estr5 could be grouped into the gdsl family and was further classified into the subfamily of sgnh hydrolases. the gene estr5 was expressed in escherichia coli bl21 (de3) and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. recombinant estr5 exhibited highest catalytic efficiency towards alpha-naphthyl acetate followed by phenyl acetate and p-nitrophenyl acetate and had no activity towards pnp esters with acyl chains longer than c8. the enzyme exhibited optimal activity at around 60 degrees c and  ph 8.0, was stable at ph ranging from 6.0 to 11.0 and was slightly activated by detergent tween, nonidet p-40, and triton x-100. these properties suggest that estr5 has great potential for basic research and industrial applications. to our  knowledge, this is the first arylesterase obtained from rumen microenvironment.
