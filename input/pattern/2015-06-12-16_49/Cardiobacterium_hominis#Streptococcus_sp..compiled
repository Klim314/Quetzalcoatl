TI  - Impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (RP) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [GR]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM) analysis. METHODS: Individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or >3 sites with AL >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GR (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >/=2.5 mm after treatment. Subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM analysis. Significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: The majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. Species that increased or persisted in high frequency in RP but were significantly reduced in GR included Bacteroidetes sp., Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Tannerella forsythia, Dialister spp., Selenomonas spp., Catonella morbi, Eubacterium spp., Filifactor alocis, Parvimonas micra, Peptostreptococcus sp. OT113, Fusobacterium sp. OT203, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Streptococcus intermedius or Streptococcus constellatus, and Shuttlesworthia satelles. In contrast, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Gemella haemolysans, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Kingella oralis, Lautropia mirabilis, Neisseria elongata, Rothia dentocariosa, Streptococcus australis, and Veillonella spp. were more associated with therapeutic success. CONCLUSION: Persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.
TI  - Endocarditis in a large district general hospital: A study of the microbiological spectrum between 2000 and 2011.
AB  - Infective endocarditis is one of three common cardiac infections in the United Kingdom, in addition to myocarditis and pericarditis, with a reported incidence of 1.7 to 6.2 cases per 100,000 patient years. Infective endocarditis can often have serious consequences and a wide variety of organisms may be the causative pathogen. There are little published data regarding the exact spectrum of organisms that cause endocarditis in the United Kingdom and whether organisms such as streptococci still dominate. In the present study, all cases of endocarditis at the authors' institution, representing a typical nontertiary centre, were retrospectively examined and audited to provide a snapshot of the organism spectrum in these patients. The cases of more than 120 patients who were coded as having endocarditis by the institution's clinical coding department during the period between December 2000 and January 2011 were examined. Microbiological tests and clinical case notes of all patients were reviewed. Of the 101 patients diagnosed with and treated for endocarditis, 64 were male, with a mean age of 60.57 years. The most common organisms identified were Streptococcus species (31%), Staphylococcus aureus (27%) and Enterococcus faecalis (21%). The organisms with the highest associated mortality rate were S aureus and the 'other organism' group, which included non-HACEK group (Haemophilus species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens and Kingella species) pathogens such as Candida albicans. Streptococcus species and S aureus remain the main cause of endocarditis in a typical hospital setting in the United Kingdom, although in a smaller proportion of cases than historical data suggests. Overall, mortality remains high, and the clinician should remain vigilant to endocarditis in any patient with a positive blood culture because the number of cases of endocarditis caused by less typical organisms are increasing.
TI  - Comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (RP) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (GRs = good responders) or periodontal health (PH) using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). METHODS: At baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with PH and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM. The subjects with periodontitis were classified as having RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or more than three sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GRs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after treatment. Significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis and chi(2) tests. RESULTS: More species were detected in patients with disease (GR or RP) than in those without disease (PH). Subjects with RP were distinguished from GRs or those with PH by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Campylobacter gracilis, Eubacterium nodatum, Selenomonas noxia, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Treponema spp., and Eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, TM7 spp. oral taxon [OT] 346/356, Bacteroidetes sp. OT 272/274, Solobacterium moorei, Desulfobulbus sp. OT 041, Brevundimonas diminuta, Sphaerocytophaga sp. OT 337, Shuttleworthia satelles, Filifactor alocis, Dialister invisus/pneumosintes, Granulicatella adiacens, Mogibacterium timidum, Veillonella atypica, Mycoplasma salivarium, Synergistes sp. cluster II, and Acidaminococcaceae [G-1] sp. OT 132/150/155/148/135) (P <0.05). Species that were more prevalent in subjects with PH than in patients with periodontitis included Actinomyces sp. OT 170, Actinomyces spp. cluster I, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Lautropia mirabilis, Propionibacterium propionicum, Rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and Streptococcus sanguinis (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: As determined by HOMIM, patients with RP presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the GR and PH groups.
TI  - Activity of DX-619 compared to other agents against viridans group streptococci,  Streptococcus bovis, and Cardiobacterium hominis.
AB  - Against 198 viridans group streptococci, 25 Streptococcus bovis strains, and 5 Cardiobacterium hominis strains, MICs of DX-619, a des-F(6)-quinolone, were between 0.004 and 0.25 microg/ml. These MICs were lower than those of other quinolones (< or = 0.008 to > 32 microg/ml). Beta-lactam MICs were between < or = 0.008 and 16 microg/ml. Azithromycin resistance was found in most species, while most were telithromycin susceptible. Glycopeptides and linezolid were active against viridans group strains but inactive against C. hominis.
TI  - Optimisation of the prevention and treatment of bacterial endocarditis.
AB  - This paper reviews currently established guidelines for the prevention and treatment of bacterial endocarditis. Endocarditis remains a life-threatening disease with substantial morbidity and mortality. Primary prevention of endocarditis, whenever possible, is therefore very important. In an individual with endocarditis, rapid diagnosis and effective treatment are essential to good patient outcome. The guidelines discussed here are largely based on those issued by the American Heart Association. While most cases of endocarditis are not attributable to an invasive procedure, certain procedures are associated with bacteraemia by organisms commonly associated with endocarditis, and antibacterial prophylaxis is recommended before such procedures. Patient cardiac conditions are stratified into high, moderate and negligible risk categories based on potential outcome if endocarditis develops. For oral, dental, respiratory tract, and oesophageal procedures (most often associated with viridans streptococci) the standard antibacterial regimen is oral amoxicillin. For gastrointestinal and genitourinary procedures (most often associated with enterococci), parenteral antibacterials are most often recommended. For high-risk patients, intramuscular or intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin (or vancomycin and gentamicin in penicillin-allergic individuals) is recommended. For moderate risk patients, an option of oral amoxicillin or parenteral ampicillin is offered. Treatment of bacterial endocarditis is guided by identification of the causative micro-organism. Approximately 80% of cases of endocarditis are due to the gram-positive cocci: streptococci and staphylococci. Other gram-positive organisms include enterococci (predominantly Enterococcusfaecalis and E. faecium) and the HACEK group of organisms (Haemophilus parainfluenzae, H. aphrophilus, Actinobacillus [Haemophilus] actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella kingae). In general, for uncomplicated cases of endocarditis due to penicillin-susceptible viridans streptococci or Streptococcus bovis 4 weeks of benzylpenicillin (or ceftriaxone) is the preferred regimen for most patients aged >65 years. A 2-week course of treatment can be used when gentamicin is added, in patients at low risk for adverse events caused by gentamicin therapy. When endocarditis is caused by strains of viridans streptococci or S. bovis relatively resistant to penicillin, or by enterococci, both benzylpenicillin and gentamicin are recommended. For staphylococcal endocarditis on native heart valves, nafcillin or oxacillin with or without gentamicin is the preferred regimen. In prosthetic valve staphylococcal endocarditis, nafcillin (or oxacillin) with rifampicin and gentamicin is recommended. For all of the above situations, vancomycin is recommended for the patient allergic to penicillin (or methicillin). Finally, consideration of out-of-hospital therapy in selected patients is discussed.
TI  - Use of corticosteroids in glomerulonephritis related to infective endocarditis: three cases and review.
AB  - We report the cases of three patients treated for infective endocarditis (IE) for whom corticosteroids were added to the antibiotic treatment. They all had clinical and biological evidence of immune-mediated glomerulonephritis. The microorganisms responsible for IE were Coxiella burnetii, Streptococcus bovis, and Cardiobacterium hominis. Median duration of IE before antimicrobial therapy was 7 months. In all patients, renal function deteriorated despite appropriate antimicrobial treatment for a mean duration of 16 days, but it improved after addition of corticosteroid therapy. All patients were cured of IE. A literature review revealed four additional cases of IE-related glomerulonephritis in which adjunctive immunosuppressive therapy was considered to be effective. Although corticosteroid therapy is generally not recommended for IE, it should be considered for patients whose renal dysfunction secondary to glomerulonephritis does not improve with appropriate antimicrobial treatment, especially if the duration of the illness is long.
TI  - Serious bacterial infections after endoscopic procedures.
AB  - Transient bacteremia during and after endoscopic procedures is a well- documented phenomenon, but complicated bacteremia such as endocarditis in patients at risk is considered to be extremely rare. The recommendations for prophylaxis before endoscopy in patients with valvular heart disease were recently released. We discuss 16 cases of complicated bacteremia that developed after endoscopy (eight cases previously published in the literature and eight cases we encountered). The endoscopic procedures were gastroscopy (five cases), sclerotherapy (six cases), sigmoidoscopy (three cases), and esophageal dilation (two cases). Fourteen patients had underlying disease: valvular heart disease (six patients), cirrhosis of the liver (five patients, one of whom also had a prosthetic knee), valvular heart disease and cirrhosis of the liver (two patients), and gastric carcinoma (one patient). The organisms involved were Streptococcus viridans (six cases), streptococcus group D (three cases), Streptococcus pneumoniae (two cases), Streptococcus microaerophilicus (two cases), Staphylococcus aureus (two cases), and Cardiobacterium hominis (one case). The patients presented with the following infections: endocarditis (12 patients), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (two patients), septic arthritis (one patient), and brain abscess (one patient). The outcome was good in 15 patients; one patient died. Patients with valvular heart disease, cirrhosis of the liver, ascites, malignancies, or prosthetic joints who undergo endoscopic procedures should be considered for antibiotic prophylaxis.
TI  - [Endocarditis caused by Cardiobacterium hominis].
AB  - The incidence of endocarditis due to Cardiobacterium hominis is probably underestimated because clinical presentations vary greatly and culture of this Gram negative germ is difficult. A 48-year-old man with a past history of post-streptococcic aortic regurgitation was hospitalized twice within 1 week for fever (38 degrees C) and junctional tachycardia which responded to amiodarone. Subsequently, infero-apical necrosis was documented. Based on the result of the laboratory tests, coronary embolism was suspected although 12 blood cultures were negative. The patient recovered well with a standard antibiotic treatment. Fifteen days later, the blood cultures revealed Cardiobacterium hominis. Antibiotic therapy was adapted and aortic valve replacement was programmed. Two months later the patient died from uncontrollable left heart failure. A 63-year-old man who had had mitral valve replacement 10 years earlier for Streptococcus mitis endocarditis was hospitalized for fever (38 degrees C) and a painful left calf. Phlebocavography eliminated deep vein thrombosis and a complete cardiac work-up was inconclusive. Endocarditis was suspected although blood cultures were negative. The patient was given oral penicillin and discharged after one week. Three months later, the patient was again febrile (38 degrees C) and suffered a cerebral vascular event. Fourteen days after blood sampling, cultures revealed Cardiobacterium hominis. The patient's haemodynamic status worsened and valve replacement with atrioplasty was performed. Outcome after 4 years follow-up has been favourable. Endocarditis due to Cardiobacterium hominis, a saprophitic germ of the upper airway and the female genital tract, has been reported in 64 cases in the literature. The clinical picture is often limited to fever and a heart murmur and laboratory tests show an accelerated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and hyperleukocytosis. Inflammatory type anaemia is often found due to the latency of the endocarditis. Complications are frequent and can be fatal due to massive pulmonary emboli, cerebral vascular events or irreversible heart failure. C. hominis is sensitive to amoxycillin and netilmicin. Surgical treatment of the valvulopathy is indicated.
TI  - The use of beta-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of septicaemia and endocarditis.
AB  - Despite the availability of numerous beta-lactam antibiotics, benzylpenicillin remains the most important beta-lactam antibiotic in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis. Penicillin alone and in combination with an aminoglycoside is effective in the treatment of endocarditis due to all streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus aprophilus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Listeria monocytogenes. Oral phenoxymethylpenicillin in combination with streptomycin is effective in treating endocarditis due to viridans streptococci. Ampicillin is effective in endocarditis due to Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, H. paraphrophilus, Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli. Oral amoxicillin with gentamicin has been used to treat enterococcal endocarditis. The penicillinase-resistant penicillins are effective in treating S. aureus endocarditis. Carbenicillin or ticarcillin in combination with tobramycin or gentamicin are used to treat endocarditis due to Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The use of piperacillin in combination with tobramycin against P. aeruginosa endocarditis has been associated with failure and increased resistance. The cephalosporins have been used to treat endocarditis caused by susceptible organisms. There have been few data on the efficacy of the newer cephalosporins in treating endocarditis. They have been used to treat septicaemia due to susceptible organisms with good results.
TI  - Infective endocarditis caused by slow-growing, fastidious, Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - In a review of endocarditis caused by fastidious, slow-growing gram-negative rods, similarities in the spectrum of disease overshadow differences among cases grouped by specific organisms. Cardiobacterium hominis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Haemophilus species usually seed previously damaged cardiac valves presumably during bacteremia from an upper respiratory site. The clinical presentation resembles that of Streptococcus viridans endocarditis and is usually subacute or chronic. Despite bacteriologic cure, severe CHF and/or systemic embolization frequently develops during or following the course of antibiotics, resulting in significant morbidity and a high mortality rate. This report of nine cases diagnosed at five hospitals in a 7-year period suggests that endocarditis due to these organisms is more common than previously appreciated and frequently goes unrecognized. This is probably due to a lack of attention to the requirements for culture of this group of bacteria with propensity for granular growth in broth. We have proposed specific cultural techniques appropriate to the search for these organisms in patients with apparent culture-negative endocarditis.
