TI  == bovine intestinal bacteria inactivate and degrade ceftiofur and ceftriaxone with  multiple beta-lactamases.
AB  == the veterinary cephalosporin drug ceftiofur is rapidly degraded in the bovine intestinal tract. a cylinder-plate assay was used to detect microbiologically active ceftiofur, and high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was used to quantify the amount of ceftiofur remaining after incubation  with bovine intestinal anaerobic bacteria, which were isolated from colon contents or feces from 8 cattle. ninety-six percent of the isolates were able to  inactivate ceftiofur to some degree, and 54% actually degraded the drug. none of  9 fungal isolates inactivated or degraded ceftiofur. facultative and obligate anaerobic bacterial species that inactivated or degraded ceftiofur were identified with vitek and biolog systems, respectively. a subset of ceftiofur degraders also degraded the chemically similar drug ceftriaxone. most of the species of bacteria that degraded ceftiofur belonged to the genera bacillus and bacteroides. pcr analysis of bacterial dna detected specific beta-lactamase genes. bacillus cereus and b. mycoides isolates produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and metallo-beta-lactamases. seven isolates of bacteroides spp. produced multiple beta-lactamases, including possibly cepa, and metallo-beta-lactamases. isolates of eubacterium biforme, bifidobacterium breve,  and several clostridium spp. also produced ceftiofur-degrading beta-lactamases. an agar gel overlay technique on isoelectric focusing separations of bacterial lysates showed that beta-lactamase enzymes were sufficient to degrade ceftiofur.  these results suggest that ceftiofur is inactivated nonenzymatically and degraded enzymatically by multiple beta-lactamases from bacteria in the large intestines of cattle.

TI  == in vitro inhibition activity of nisin a, nisin z, pediocin pa-1 and antibiotics against common intestinal bacteria.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the sensitivity of 21 common intestinal bacteria to six antibiotics and three broad-spectrum bacteriocins (nisins z and a and pediocin pa-1). methods and results: neutralized cell-free culture supernatants containing active bacteriocins, and antibiotics were tested with the agar diffusion test and the disc-diffusion method, respectively. the tested intestinal strains showed high sensitivity to most antibiotics except for streptomycin and oxacillin. nisins a and z (8 mug per well) had similar activity spectra and inhibited all gram-positive intestinal bacteria at different levels (except streptococcus salivarius), with bifidobacteria (except bifidobacterium breve and bif. catenulatum), collinsella aerofaciens and eubacterium biforme being the most sensitive strains, but they were not active against gram-negative bacteria. surprisingly, none of the tested strains were inhibited by pediocin pa-1 (16 mug  per well). conclusion: pediocin pa-1 which is very active against listeria spp. and other food pathogens did not inhibit major intestinal species in the human intestine in contrast to both nisins a and z. significance and impact of the study: our data suggest that pediocin pa-1 has potential to inhibit listeria within the intestinal microbiota without altering commensal bacteria.
