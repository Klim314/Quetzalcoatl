TI  == diet is a major factor governing the fecal butyrate-producing community structure across mammalia, aves and reptilia.
AB  == butyrate-producing bacteria have an important role in maintaining host health. they are well studied in human and medically associated animal models; however, much less is known for other vertebrata. we investigated the butyrate-producing community in hindgut-fermenting mammalia (n = 38), aves (n = 8) and reptilia (n = 8) using a gene-targeted pyrosequencing approach of the terminal genes of the main butyrate-synthesis pathways, namely butyryl-coa:acetate coa-transferase (but) and butyrate kinase (buk). most animals exhibit high gene abundances, and clear diet-specific signatures were detected with but genes significantly enriched in omnivores and herbivores compared with carnivores. but dominated the  butyrate-producing community in these two groups, whereas buk was more abundant in many carnivorous animals. clustering of protein sequences (5% cutoff) of the combined communities (but and buk) placed carnivores apart from other diet groups, except for noncarnivorous carnivora, which clustered together with carnivores. the majority of clusters (but: 5141 and buk: 2924) did not show close relation to any reference sequences from public databases (identity <90%) demonstrating a large 'unknown diversity'. each diet group had abundant signature taxa, where buk genes linked to clostridium perfringens dominated in carnivores and but genes associated with ruminococcaceae bacterium d16 were specific for herbivores and omnivores. whereas 16s rrna gene analysis showed similar overall patterns, it was unable to reveal communities at the same depth and resolution as the functional gene-targeted approach. this study demonstrates that butyrate producers are abundant across vertebrates exhibiting great functional redundancy  and that diet is the primary determinant governing the composition of the butyrate-producing guild.

TI  == revealing the bacterial butyrate synthesis pathways by analyzing (meta)genomic data.
AB  == butyrate-producing bacteria have recently gained attention, since they are important for a healthy colon and when altered contribute to emerging diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and type ii diabetes. this guild is polyphyletic and cannot be accurately detected by 16s rrna gene sequencing. consequently, approaches targeting the terminal genes of the main butyrate-producing pathway have been developed. however, since additional pathways exist and alternative, newly recognized enzymes catalyzing the terminal reaction have been described, previous investigations are often incomplete. we undertook a broad analysis of butyrate-producing pathways and individual genes by screening 3,184 sequenced bacterial genomes from the integrated microbial genome database. genomes of 225 bacteria with a potential to produce butyrate were identified, including many previously unknown candidates. the majority of candidates belong to distinct families within the firmicutes, but members of nine other phyla, especially from  actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, spirochaetes, and thermotogae, were also identified as potential butyrate producers. the established gene catalogue (3,055 entries) was used to screen for butyrate synthesis pathways in 15 metagenomes derived from stool samples of healthy individuals provided by the hmp (human microbiome project) consortium. a high percentage of total genomes exhibited a butyrate-producing pathway (mean, 19.1%;  range, 3.2% to 39.4%), where the acetyl-coenzyme a (coa) pathway was the most prevalent (mean, 79.7% of all pathways), followed by the lysine pathway (mean, 11.2%). diversity analysis for the acetyl-coa pathway showed that the same few firmicute groups associated with several lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae were dominating in most individuals, whereas the other pathways were associated primarily with bacteroidetes. importance microbiome research has revealed new, important roles of our gut microbiota for maintaining health, but an understanding of effects of specific microbial functions on the host is in its infancy, partly because in-depth functional microbial analyses are rare and publicly available databases are often incomplete/misannotated. in this study, we focused on production of butyrate, the main energy source for colonocytes, which  plays a critical role in health and disease. we have provided a complete database of genes from major known butyrate-producing pathways, using in-depth genomic analysis of publicly available genomes, filling an important gap to accurately assess the butyrate-producing potential of complex microbial communities from "-omics"-derived data. furthermore, a reference data set containing the abundance and diversity of butyrate synthesis pathways from the healthy gut microbiota was  established through a metagenomics-based assessment. this study will help in understanding the role of butyrate producers in health and disease and may assist the development of treatments for functional dysbiosis.

TI  == prebiotic stimulation of human colonic butyrate-producing bacteria and bifidobacteria, in vitro.
AB  == dietary macronutrients affect the composition of the gut microbiota, and prebiotics are used to improve and maintain a healthy gut. the impact of prebiotics on dominant gut bacteria other than bifidobacteria, however, is under-researched. here, we report carbohydrate utilisation patterns for representative butyrate-producing anaerobes, belonging to the gram-positive firmicutes families lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae, by comparison with selected bacteroides and bifidobacterium species. growth assessments using anaerobic hungate tubes and a new rapid microtitre plate assay were generally in  good agreement. the bacteroides strains tested showed some growth on basal medium with no added carbohydrates, utilising peptides in the growth medium. the butyrate-producing strains exhibited different growth profiles on the substrates, which included starch, inulin, fructooligosaccharides (fos), galactooligosaccharides (gos) and xylooligosaccharides (xos). eleven were able to grow on short-chain fos, but this number decreased as the chain length of the fructan substrates increased. long-chain inulin was utilised by roseburia inulinivorans, but by none of the bifidobacterium species examined here. xos was  a more selective growth substrate than fos, with only six of the 11 firmicutes strains able to use xos for growth. these results illustrate the selectivity of different prebiotics and help to explain why some are butyrogenic.

TI  == intestinal dysbiosis and depletion of butyrogenic bacteria in clostridium difficile infection and nosocomial diarrhea.
AB  == clostridium difficile infection (cdi) causes nearly half a million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the united states each year. although the importance of the gut microbiota in c. difficile pathogenesis is well recognized, components of the human gut flora critical for colonization resistance are not known. culture-independent high-density roche 454 pyrosequencing was used to survey the  distal gut microbiota for 39 individuals with cdi, 36 subjects with c. difficile-negative nosocomial diarrhea (cdn), and 40 healthy control subjects. a  total of 526,071 partial 16s rrna sequence reads of the v1 to v3 regions were aligned with 16s databases, identifying 3,531 bacterial phylotypes from 115 fecal samples. genomic analysis revealed significant alterations of organism lineages in both the cdi and cdn groups, which were accompanied by marked decreases in microbial diversity and species richness driven primarily by a paucity of phylotypes within the firmicutes phylum. normally abundant gut commensal organisms, including the ruminococcaceae and lachnospiraceae families and butyrate-producing c2 to c4 anaerobic fermenters, were significantly depleted in  the cdi and cdn groups. these data demonstrate associations between the depletion of ruminococcaceae, lachnospiraceae, and butyrogenic bacteria in the gut microbiota and nosocomial diarrhea, including c. difficile infection. mechanistic studies focusing on the functional roles of these organisms in diarrheal diseases and resistance against c. difficile colonization are warranted.
