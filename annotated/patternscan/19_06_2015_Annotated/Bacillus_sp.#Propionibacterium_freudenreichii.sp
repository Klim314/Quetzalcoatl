TI  == production of wheat bread without preservatives using sourdough starters.
AB  == in order for the beneficial effects of sourdough application in breadmaking to take place a proper selection of lactic acid bacteria species and strains, an appropriate technology and effective control of the purity and activity of the selected cultures. four symbiotic starters for sourdough for the production of bread were developed and probated in a production laboratory using the selected strains lactobacillus brevis lbrz7, l. buchneri lbrz6, l. plantarum x2, l. paracasei rn5, l. sanfranciscensis r and l. fermentum lbrh10 and the probiotic strain propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii nbimcc 327. the starter sourdoughs that include propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii nbimcc 327 had greater antimicrobial activity against saprophytic microorganisms: bacillus subtilis, b. mesentericus, aspergillus niger, penicillium sp. and rhizopus sp., but none of them inhibited the growth of bakery yeasts saccharomyces cerevisiae. it was established that in order to prevent bacterial spoilage 10% of the selected starter sourdoughs had to be added in the breadmaking process, while for prevention of mold spoilage the necessary amount of starter sourdough had to be between 15% and 20%.the application of the developed starters for the production of wheat bread guarantees longer shelf life and no adverse alterations in the features of the final bread.

TI  == biosynthesis of vitamin b12. different pathways in some aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.
AB  == radioactivity from [1'-14c]riboflavin was incorporated into the 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole moiety of vitamin b12 in the aerobes bacillus megaterium, nocardia rugosa and streptomyces sp. as well as in the aerotolerant anaerobe propionibacterium freudenreichii, but not in the anaerobe eubacterium limosum. as recently published for e. limosum, also in the anaerobe clostridium barkeri radioactivity from [1-14c]glycine and [2-14c]glycine was found in the 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole moiety, but not in the corrin moiety. the addition of l-[methyl-14c]methionine to c. barkeri led to the labeling of the corrin moiety and the 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole moiety, showing that the seven "extra" methyl groups in the corrin ring as well as the two methyl groups of the base part originate from this precursor. in clostridium thermoaceticum, forming the vitamin b12 analog 5-methoxybenzimidazolylcobamide, [1-14c]glycine and [2-14c]glycine were also incorporated into the 5-methoxybenzimidazole moiety, but not into the corrin ring. in e. limosum l-[u-14c]glutamate led to the labeling of the corrin ring of vitamin b12, but not of its base moiety. these results together with data from the literature indicate that a common biosynthetic pathway might exist for the corrinoid biosynthesis in aerobic microorganisms, and in those aerotolerant anaerobes like the propionibacteria, which form the 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole moiety of vitamin b12 only under aerobic conditions. they also show that this pathway differs from the pathway found in anaerobic bacteria.
