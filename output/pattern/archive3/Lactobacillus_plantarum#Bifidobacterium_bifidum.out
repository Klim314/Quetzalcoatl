cocktails of probiotics pre-adapted to multiple stress factors are more robust under simulated gastrointestinal conditions than their parental counterparts and exhibit enhanced antagonistic capabilities against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus.
background: the success of the probiotics in delivery of health benefits depends  on their ability to withstand the technological and gastrointestinal conditions; hence development of robust cultures is critical to the probiotic industry. combinations of probiotic cultures have proven to be more effective than the use of single cultures for treatment and prevention of heterogeneous diseases. we investigated the effect of pre- adaptation of probiotics to multiple stresses on their stability under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and the effect of their singular as well as their synergistic antagonistic effect against selected enteric pathogens. methods: probiotic cultures were inoculated into mrs broth adjusted to ph 2 and incubated for 2 h at 37 degrees c. survivors of ph 2 were subcultured into 2% bile acid for 1 h at 37 degrees c. cells that showed growth after exposure to 2% bile acid for 1 h were finally inoculated in fresh mrs broth and incubated at 55 degrees c for 2 h. the cells surviving were then used as stress adapted cultures. the adapted cultures were exposed to simulated gastrointestinal conditions and their non- adapted counterparts were used to compare the effects of stress adaptation. the combination cultures were tested for their antipathogenic effects on escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. results: acid and bile tolerances of most of the stress-adapted cells were higher than of the non-adapted cells. viable counts of all the stress-adapted lactobacilli and bifidobacterium longum lmg 13197 were higher after sequential exposure to simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. however, for b. longum bb46 and b. bifidum lmg 13197, viability of non-adapted cells was higher than for adapted cells after exposure to these fluids. a cocktail containing l. plantarum + b. longum bb46 + b. longum lmg 13197 best inhibited s. aureus while e. coli was best inhibited by a combination containing l. acidophilus la14 150b + b. longum bb46 + b. bifidum lmg 11041. a cocktail containing the six non- adapted cultures was the least effective in inhibiting the pathogens. conclusion: multi-stress pre-adaptation enhances viability of probiotics under simulated gastrointestinal conditions; and formulations containing a mixture of multi stress-adapted cells exhibits enhanced synergistic effects against foodborne pathogens.
role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.
probiotics lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus acidophilus suppresses dmh-induced procarcinogenic fecal enzymes and preneoplastic aberrant crypt foci in early colon carcinogenesis in sprague dawley rats.
diet makes an important contribution to colorectal cancer (crc) risk implying risks for crc are potentially reducible. therefore, the probiotics have been suggested as the prophylactic measure in colon cancer. in this study, different probiotics were used to compare their protective potential against 1,2 dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride (dmh)-induced chemical colon carcinogenesis in sprague dawley rats. animals belonging to different probiotic groups were fed orally with 1 x 10(9) lactobacilli daily for 1 week, and then a weekly injection of dmh was given intraperitoneally for 6 wks with daily administration of probiotic. lactobacillus gg and l.acidophilus + dmh-treated animals had maximum percent reduction in acf counts. a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in fecal nitroreductase activity was observed in l.casei + dmh and l.plantarum + dmh-treated rats whereas beta-glucuronidase activity decreased in l.gg + dmh and l.acidophilus + dmh-treated rats. animals treated with bifidobacterium bifidum + dmh had significant decreased beta-glucosidase activity. however, not much difference was observed in the colon morphology of animals belonging to various probiotic + dmh-treated rats compared with dmh-treated alone. the results indicated that probiotics, l.gg, and l.acidophilus can be used as the better prophylactic agents for experimental colon carcinogenesis.
the role of components of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus in pathogenesis and serologic diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid diseases.
during recent years, researchers have been focusing on the concept of an infectious etiology of autoimmune diseases. the most discussed theory is molecular mimicry, i.e. the emergence of autoreactive clones of t- and b-lymphocytes as a result of cross-immune response to homologous bacterial or viral antigen. information on the role of probiotic microorganisms (pm) in the molecular mechanisms of autoimmune thyroid diseases (atd) is limited. using proteins and immunogenic peptides databanks and relevant computer programs, the homology between the amino acid sequences of thyroid peroxidase (tpo) and thyroglobulin (tg), which are potential b- and t-cell epitopes of these antigens, and proteins of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli was established. moreover, we have found components of cells of bifidobacterium bifidum 791, bifidobacterium adolescentis 94 bim, bifidobacterium longum b379m and lactobacillus plantarum b-01 that selectively bind human antibodies to tpo (anti-tpo) and antibodies to tg (anti-tg) and compete with natural antigens for the binding of anti-tpo and anti-tg in elisa. additionally, a three-fold difference was observed between the probability of detecting antibodies (abs) to the antigens of l. plantarum b-01 and b. bifidum 791 in serum samples containing and those not containing anti-tpo. on the whole, our data are arguments in favour of the assumption of the possible role of pm of the genera bifidobacterium and lactobacillus in triggering atd by the mechanism of molecular mimicry. the data obtained in silico and in vitro should be proven by use of animal models and clinical studies for extrapolations to the whole body. possible antigenic properties of components/proteins of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, selectively binding anti-tpo and anti-tg should be taken into consideration. natural human abs to these bacterial components are probably able to cross-react with the tpo and tg in the elisa for detection of anti-tpo and anti-tg, which are serologic markers of atd. it can lead to unspecific false positive results and, hence, to an incorrect diagnosis.
mixed culture fermentation studies on the effects of synbiotics on the human intestinal pathogens campylobacter jejuni and escherichia coli.
batch and continuous culture anaerobic fermentation systems, inoculated with human faeces, were utilised to investigate the antimicrobial actions of two probiotics, lactobacillus plantarum 0407, combined with oligofructose and bifidobacterium bifidum bb12, combined with a mixture of oligofructose and xylo-oligosaccharides (50:50 w/w) against e. coli and campylobacter jejuni. in batch fermenters, both e. coli and c. jejuni were inhibited by the synbiotics, even when the culture ph was maintained at around neutral. in continuous culture c. jejuni was inhibited but the synbiotic failed to inhibit e. coli. although no definitive answer in addressing the mechanisms underlying antimicrobial activity was derived, results suggested that acetate and lactate directly were conferring antagonistic action, rather than as a result of lowering culture ph. in the course of the study culturing and fluorescent in situ hybridisation (fish) methodologies for the enumeration of bacterial populations were compared. bifidobacterial populations were underestimated using plating techniques, suggesting the non-culturability of certain bifidobacterial species.
purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603 was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
