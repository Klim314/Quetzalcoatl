TI  == antibacterial effects of traditional chinese medicine monomers against streptococcus pneumoniae via inhibiting pneumococcal histidine kinase (vick).
AB  == two-component systems (tcss) have the potential to be an effective target of the  antimicrobials, and thus received much attention in recent years. vick/vicr is one of tcss in streptococcus pneumoniae (s. pneumoniae), which is essential for pneumococcal survival. we have previously obtained several traditional chinese medicine monomers using a computer-based screening. in this study, either alone or in combination with penicillin, their antimicrobial activities were evaluated  based on in vivo and in vitro assays. the results showed that the mics of 5'-(methylthio)-5'-deoxyadenosine, octanal 2, 4-dinitrophenylhydrazone, deoxyshikonin, kavahin, and dodecyl gallate against s. pneumoniae were 37.1, 38.5, 17, 68.5, and 21 mug/ml, respectively. time-killing assays showed that these compounds elicited bactericidal effects against s. pneumoniae d39 strain, which led to a 6-log reduction in cfu after exposure to compounds at four times of the mic for 24 h. the five compounds inhibited the growth of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans or streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, meanwhile, deoxyshikonin and dodecyl gallate displayed strong inhibitory activities against staphylococcus aureus. these compounds showed no obvious cytotoxicity effects on vero cells. survival time of the mice infected by s. pneumoniae strains was prolonged by the treatment with the compounds. importantly, all of the five compounds exerted antimicrobial effects against multidrug-resistant clinical strains of s. pneumoniae. moreover, even at sub-mic  concentration, they inhibited cell division and biofilm formation. the five compounds all have enhancement effect on penicillin. deoxyshikonin and dodecyl gallate showed significantly synergic antimicrobial activity with penicillin in vivo and in vitro, and effectively reduced nasopharyngeal and lung colonization caused by different penicillin-resistant pneumococcal serotypes. in addition, the two compounds also showed synergic antimicrobial activity with erythromycin and tetracycline. taken together, our results suggest that these novel vick inhibitors may be promising compounds against the pneumococcus, including penicillin-resistant strains.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of chemokine cxcl10 for dermal and oral microorganisms.
AB  == cxcl10 (ip-10) is a small 10 kda chemokine with antimicrobial activity. it is induced by ifn-gamma, chemoattracts mononuclear cells, and promotes adhesion of t cells. recently, we detected cxcl10 on the surface of the skin and in the oral cavity. in the current study, we used broth microdilution and radial diffusion assays to show that cxcl10 inhibits the growth of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, corynebacterium jeikeium, corynebacterium striatum, and candida albicans hmv4c, but not corynebacterium bovis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, poryphromonas gingivalis, or c. albicans atcc 64124. the reason for the selective antimicrobial activity is not yet known. however, antimicrobial activity of cxcl10 may be related to its composition and structure, as a cationic 98 amino acid residue molecule with 10 lysine residues,  7 arginine residues, a total net charge of +11, and a theoretical pi of 9.93. modeling studies revealed that cxcl10 contains an alpha-helix at the n-terminal,  three anti-parallel beta-strands in the middle, and an alpha-helix at the c-terminal. thus, cxcl10, when produced on the surface of the skin or in the oral cavity, likely has antimicrobial activity and may enhance innate antimicrobial and cellular responses to the presence of select commensal or opportunistic microorganisms.

TI  == antibacterial activity of berry juices, an in vitro study.
AB  == abstract objective. the aim of the present study was to evaluate in vitro antibacterial activities of blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices on bacteria associated with gingival inflammation. materials and methods. the growth of selected bacteria (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa) was studied in vitro on agar plates. the  content of phenols in the different extracts was measured with hplc-esi-ms. results. the spectrometric analysis identified that the highest level of the single phenols studied was found for ferulic acid (113 mug/ml) in blackcurrant juice. sea buckthorn contained low levels of selected phenols. total bacterial inhibition for all bacterial species studied was found at 20% berry juice concentration with ph varying between 4.1-5.4. conclusions. the present study identified that in vitro bacterial growth on agar plates was inhibited by blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices and that low juice ph explains bacterial in vitro growth. this may have clinical implications in biofilm development, reducing the risks for both tooth decay and gingivitis.

TI  == oral bacterial dna findings in pericardial fluid.
AB  == background: we recently reported that large amounts of oral bacterial dna can be  found in thrombus aspirates of myocardial infarction patients. some case reports  describe bacterial findings in pericardial fluid, mostly done with conventional culturing and a few with pcr; in purulent pericarditis, nevertheless, bacterial pcr has not been used as a diagnostic method before. objective: to find out whether bacterial dna can be measured in the pericardial fluid and if it correlates with pathologic-anatomic findings linked to cardiovascular diseases. methods: twenty-two pericardial aspirates were collected aseptically prior to forensic autopsy at tampere university hospital during 2009-2010. of the autopsies, 10 (45.5%) were free of coronary artery disease (cad), 7 (31.8%) had mild and 5 (22.7%) had severe cad. bacterial dna amounts were determined using real-time quantitative pcr with specific primers and probes for all bacterial strains associated with endodontic disease (streptococcus mitis group, streptococcus anginosus group, staphylococcus aureus/staphylococcus epidermidis,  prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra) and periodontal disease (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatus, and dialister pneumosintes). results: of 22 cases, 14 (63.6%) were positive for endodontic and 8 (36.4%) for periodontal-disease-associated bacteria. only one case was positive for bacterial culturing. there was a statistically significant association between the relative amount of bacterial dna in the pericardial fluid and the severity of cad (p=0.035). conclusions: oral bacterial dna was detectable in pericardial fluid and an association between the severity of cad and the total amount of bacterial  dna in pericardial fluid was found, suggesting that this kind of measurement might be useful for clinical purposes.

TI  == infectious prosthetic hip joint loosening: bacterial species involved in its aetiology and their antibiotic resistance profiles against antibiotics recommended for the therapy of implant-associated infections.
AB  == reliable microbiological diagnosis along with surgery and prolonged antibiotic therapy are key elements in the management of prosthetic-joint infections (pjis). the purpose of this study was to characterize antibiotic resistance profiles of bacteria involved in the aetiology of pjis. a total of 33 bacterial isolates cultured from 31 patients undergoing exchange of total hip prostheses were analyzed. the diagnostic approach toward isolation of prosthesis- associated microorganisms included sonication of retrieved implants and conventional cultures of periprosthetic tissues and synovial fluid. the in vitro resistance profiles of bacterial isolates were determined in relation to antibiotics recommended for the therapy of pjis using the disc diffusion method, e-tests((r)) and broth microdilution system. coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) were predominant microorganisms followed by staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus mitis, and propionibacterium acnes. twenty out of 30 and 12 out of 30 staphylococcal isolates were methicillin- and multi-drug resistant,  respectively. only two isolates were rifampicinresistant. all staphylococci were  susceptible to glycopeptides and linezolid. this paper stresses the pathogenic role of staphylococci in patients suffering from implant loosening and reports high methicillin- and multidrug-resistance rates in these bacteria. hence, antimicrobial susceptibility tests of individual bacterial isolates must always be performed to guide selection of the optimal therapeutic option.

TI  == atypical presentation of thoracic spondylodiscitis caused by streptococcus mitis.
AB  == spondylodiscitis, which is most commonly caused by staphylococcus aureus, is an uncommon infection in adults. the diagnosis of spondylodiscitis is often delayed  by its vague and non-specific presentations. as part of the normal flora in human mouth and sinuses, streptococcus mitis is a very rare cause of spondylodiscitis.  we report a case of thoracic spondylodiscitis caused by s. mitis in a patient with chronic sinusitis. the patient atypically presented with a sharp chest pain  that radiated to the back and the imaging studies were initially negative. he failed outpatient pain management and the diagnosis of spondylodiscitis was confirmed by bone biopsy 6 weeks later. treatment with antibiotics completely alleviated the pain. increased awareness and a high index of suspicion are essential for early diagnosis of spondylodiscitis with an atypical presentation.

TI  == [evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
AB  == introduction: antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (snp's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for  therapeutic purposes. it is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal snp's  possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of snp's against cariogenic bacteria: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis  responsible for initiation of dental carries. tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. nanotechnology creates a  new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. methods: colloidal silver solution (css) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were  evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis and s, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs  of 7 patients treated for dental carries at department of conservative dentistry, medical university of warsaw. mic and mbc values for css's were evaluated. results: css used in this research is of good stability. no agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. mic values were: 12-25 ppm for s. salivarius, 25 ppm for s. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for s. mitis and 50 ppm for s. mutans, while mbc values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. after 24 hours of contact  mbc values were: 25-50 ppm for s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for s. mitis and 200 ppmfor s. mutans. conclusions: antimicrobial properties of css depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. the susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in  our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.

TI  == rapid detection of gram-positive organisms by use of the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the bact/alert pediatric fan system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  == assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. we evaluated the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp) in two pediatric hospitals. positive bact/alert pediatric fan blood cultures with gram-positive organisms were tested using the bc-gp in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. to test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles  were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 cfu  per milliliter. a total of 249 gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%,  respectively. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis  with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. the  bc-gp correctly identified 14/15 cases of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus  faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae. it misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with streptococcus anginosus group as s. pneumoniae. the bc-gp detected a case of streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus agalactiae. bc-gp's rapid accurate detection of staphylococcus spp., e. faecium, and e. faecalis and its ability to  ascertain meca, vana, and vanb status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining  to optimal antibiotic use. false-positive s. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the bc-gp.

TI  == cluster of bacteria associated with peri-implantitis.
AB  == background: information on the microbiota in peri-implantitis is limited. we hypothesized that neither gender nor a history of periodontitis/smoking or the microbiota at implants differ by implant status. materials and methods: baseline  microbiological samples collected at one implant in each of 166 participants with peri-implantitis and from 47 individuals with a healthy implant were collected and analyzed by dna-dna checkerboard hybridization (78 species). clinical and radiographic data defined implant status. results: nineteen bacterial species were found at higher counts from implants with peri-implantitis including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, helicobacter pylori, haemophilus influenzae, porphyromonas gingivalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus anaerobius, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and treponema socranskii (p < .001). receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified t. forsythia, p. gingivalis, t. socranskii, staph. aureus, staph. anaerobius, strep. intermedius, and strep. mitis in peri-implantitis comprising 30% of the total microbiota. when adjusted for gender (not significant [ns]), smoking status (ns), older age (p = .003), periodontitis  history (p < .01), and t. forsythia (likelihood ratio 3.6, 95% confidence interval 1.4, 9.1, p = .007) were associated with peri-implantitis. conclusion: a cluster of bacteria including t. forsythia and staph. aureus are associated with  peri-implantitis.

TI  == sterility testing of apheresis hematopoietic progenitor cell products using an automated blood culture system.
AB  == background: aabb standards require monitoring of hematopoietic progenitor cell (hpc) products for microbial contamination. to date, there is no automated blood  culture system cleared by the food and drug administration for this application.  our objective was to validate the versatrek system (trek diagnostic systems) for  sterility testing of apheresis hpc products. study design and methods: four aerobic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, and bacillus cereus), five anaerobic bacteria (fusobacterium necrophorum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella loescheii, and propionibacterium acnes), and one fungus (candida albicans) were spiked into  apheresis hpc products at concentrations of 10, 10(2) , 10(3) , and 10(4) colony-forming units (cfus)/ml. aerobic and anaerobic bottles were incubated until positive or for up to 5 days. dna was simultaneously extracted for polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene. results: all aerobic bacteria grew in both bottles at all concentrations tested within 24 hours, and the time to positivity (ttp) was significantly shorter with  aerobic bottles. c. albicans grew in the aerobic media at all concentrations within 30 hours. anaerobes grew in the anaerobic bottle at all concentrations within 5 days. no bacteria were detected by using 16s rrna gene amplification at  10(4) cfus/ml. conclusion: compared to culture, 16s rrna gene amplification of hpcs does not improve sensitivity or turnaround time for hpc sterility testing. the versatrek system is a reliable tool for detecting microbial contamination of  apheresis hpc products with a limit of detection of less than or equal to 10 cfus/ml. inclusion of both the aerobic and the anaerobic culture bottles achieves the shortest ttp for all species tested.

AB  == advances in high-throughput dna sequencing technologies have determined an explosion in the number of sequenced bacterial genomes. comparative sequence analysis frequently reveals evidences of homologous recombination occurring with  different mechanisms and rates in different species, but the large-scale use of computational methods to identify recombination events is hampered by their high  computational costs. here, we propose a new method to identify recombination events in large datasets of whole genome sequences. using a filtering procedure of the gene conservation profiles of a test genome against a panel of strains, this algorithm identifies sets of contiguous genes acquired by homologous recombination. the locations of the recombination breakpoints are determined using a statistical test that is able to account for the differences in the natural rate of evolution between different genes. the algorithm was tested on a  dataset of 75 genomes of staphylococcus aureus and 50 genomes comprising different streptococcal species, and was able to detect intra-species recombination events in s. aureus and in streptococcus pneumoniae. furthermore, we found evidences of an inter-species exchange of genetic material between s. pneumoniae and streptococcus mitis, a closely related commensal species that colonizes the same ecological niche. the method has been implemented in an r package, reco, which is freely available from supplementary material, and provides a rapid screening tool to investigate recombination on a genome-wide scale from sequence data.

TI  == viridans streptococcal (streptococcus mitis) biosynthetic aortic prosthetic valve endocarditis (pve) complicated by complete heart block and paravalvular abscess.
AB  == prosthetic valve endocarditis (pve) may be classified clinically as early (<60 days) or late (>60 days) post-valve replacement pve. the pathogens of early versus late pve differ in type and virulence. early pve pathogens are virulent, for example, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. late pve pathogens resemble those of subacute bacterial endocarditis and are due to relatively avirulent and noninvasive organisms, for example, viridans streptococci. viridans streptococci vary in their invasiveness and abscess potential. myocardial abscess and complete heart block are rare complications of late pve due to viridans streptococci. we present an unusual case of streptococcus mitis late aortic pve complicated by aortic root abscess, myocardial abscess, and complete heart block.

TI  == microbiological etiology and susceptibility of bacterial conjunctivitis isolates  from clinical trials with ophthalmic, twice-daily besifloxacin.
AB  == introduction: bacterial conjunctivitis is a contagious infection of the surface of the eye usually treated empirically with topical antibiotics. since the etiologic agent is rarely identified, it is important to monitor which bacteria cause conjunctivitis and determine their antibacterial resistance profiles. methods: a total of 496 bacterial samples were isolated during a randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group study conducted in the united states with besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% dosed twice daily. species were determined by standard biochemical and/or molecular identification methods.  minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined according to clinical and laboratory standards institute standards. results: the most prevalent species was haemophilus influenzae, followed by staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, the streptococcus mitis group, and streptococcus pneumoniae. one species  identified in this study, which was not previously noted as a common cause of bacterial conjunctivitis, was dolosigranulum pigrum. ampicillin resistance was common among h. influenzae isolates, while macrolide resistance was high among s. pneumoniae, s. epidermidis, and s. aureus. the latter two species also included a number of isolates resistant to methicillin and ciprofloxacin. conclusion: antibiotic resistance among isolates remains a concern and the appearance of an emerging ocular pathogen, d. pigrum, suggests the need for continued observation. the topical ophthalmic fluoroquinolones continue to provide a good balance of low to moderate (i.e., manageable) levels of resistance plus broad-spectrum coverage  for empiric treatment of ocular infections.

TI  == antibacterial activity of sphingoid bases and fatty acids against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == there is growing evidence that the role of lipids in innate immunity is more important than previously realized. how lipids interact with bacteria to achieve  a level of protection, however, is still poorly understood. to begin to address the mechanisms of antibacterial activity, we determined mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of lipids common to the skin and oral cavity--the sphingoid bases d-sphingosine, phytosphingosine, and dihydrosphingosine and the fatty acids sapienic acid and lauric acid--against four gram-negative bacteria and seven gram-positive bacteria. exact kruskal-wallis tests of these values showed differences among lipid treatments (p < 0.0001) for each bacterial species except serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. d-sphingosine (mbc range, 0.3 to 19.6 mug/ml), dihydrosphingosine (mbc range, 0.6 to 39.1 mug/ml), and phytosphingosine (mbc range, 3.3 to 62.5 mug/ml) were active against all bacteria except s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa (mbc > 500 mug/ml). sapienic acid (mbc range, 31.3 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and fusobacterium nucleatum but not active against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa, corynebacterium bovis, corynebacterium striatum, and corynebacterium  jeikeium (mbc > 500 mug/ml). lauric acid (mbc range, 6.8 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against all bacteria except e. coli, s. marcescens, and p. aeruginosa (mbc > 500 mug/ml). complete killing was achieved as early as 0.5 h for some lipids but took as long as 24 h for others. hence, sphingoid bases and fatty acids have  different antibacterial activities and may have potential for prophylactic or therapeutic intervention in infection.

TI  == the role of bacteria in oral cancer.
AB  == despite the widening interest in the possible association between bacteria and different stages of cancer development, our knowledge in its relation to oral cancers remains inadequate. the aim of this review article is to derive a better  understanding on the role of various micro-organisms in the etiogenesis of oral cancers through all the available data on the pubmed. different bacteria have been proposed to induce carcinogenesis either through induction of chronic inflammation or by interference, either directly or indirectly, with eukaryotic cell cycle and signaling pathways, or by metabolism of potentially carcinogenic substances like acetaldehyde causing mutagenesis. studies have shown diversity of isolated bacterial taxa between the oral cancer tissue specimens and the control, with exiguobacterium oxidotolerans, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus and veillonella parvula being specific for tumorogenic tissues. most isolates are saccharolytic and acid tolerant. streptococcus anginosus, commonly linked with esophageal and pharyngeal cancers, is not of significance in oral cancers. similarly, significant salivary specificity is noted for three bacteria, namely, capnocytophaga gingivalis, p. melaninogenica, and streptococcus mitis in  oral cancer patients, making these species salivary markers for the early detection of oral cancers and thus improving the survival rate significantly. also, such high degree of bacterial specificity in oral cancers has also provoked the designing of new treatment options for cancer prevention by way of vaccine delivery. however, for the success of these steps, a deeper exploration into this subject with a greater understanding is warranted.

TI  == microflora in maxillofacial infections--a changing scenario?
AB  == purpose: advances in isolation and culturing techniques have brought the role of  anaerobic bacteria-causing maxillofacial infections to the fore. recent literature also favors the role of anaerobes in maxillofacial infections. a prospective clinical and microbiological study was designed to check the validity of such claims. patients and methods: this study included 88 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. pus was obtained by aspirating the involved spaces and culture and sensitivity tests were performed to determine the microbes involved and their sensitivity to various antibiotics. results: upon isolating the various organisms causing infection, it was found that 68.2% were aerobes, 13.6% were mixed infections, and 9.1% were anaerobes. streptococcus and peptostreptococcus species were the most common among aerobes and anaerobes, respectively. on determining sensitivity to penicillin, 81.3% were sensitive and  18.8% were resistant. coagulase-negative staphylococcus and staphylococcus aureus were predominantly resistant to penicillin. conclusion: analysis of the results indicated no change in microflora-causing infections in the maxillofacial region  and penicillin remains the drug of choice in treating these infections.

TI  == matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry identifies 90% of bacteria directly from blood culture vials.
AB  == matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) is now widely used for marker/multi-biomarker detection in medical diagnosis. we tested a new protocol for bacterial identification from blood culture broths in hospital routine by using collection tubes with separator gels  on 503 included samples examined over 3 months, where 1.5 ml was injected by a syringe into bd vacutainer tubes from bactec-positive bottles, before processing  for bacterial protein extraction. samples were loaded in duplicate onto the maldi ms target, allowing a series of 12 samples to be processed in duplicate within 80 min by using biflex iii and biotyper 2.0 software (bruker). including polymicrobial samples, 193 of 213 of gram-negative bacteria (91.08%) and 284 of 319 of gram-positive bacteria (89.02%) were correctly identified at the species level. enterobacteriaceae constituted 35.15% of all species found, staphylococaceae 37.96%, streptococaceae and enterococaceae 20.85%, pseudomonadaceae 1.69%, and anaerobes 2.44%. in most of the polymicrobial samples, one of the species present was identified (80.9%). seven isolates remained misidentified as streptococcus pneumoniae, all belonging to streptococcus mitis. staphylococcus aureus was identified better when grown on anaero-aerobic medium, and maldi biotyper identification scores as low as 1.4 were pertinent, provided that four successive proposals of the same species were  given. this new protocol correlates with conventional microbiology procedures by  up to 90%, and by >95% for only monomicrobial samples, and provides a decreased turn-around time for identification of bacteria isolated from blood cultures, making this technology suitable also for blood cultures, with less delay and cost decreases in bacterial diagnostics, and favouring better care of patients.

TI  == in vitro oral biofilm formation on triclosan-coated sutures in the absence and presence of additional antiplaque treatment.
AB  == purpose: this study evaluated the in vitro plaque inhibitory effect of triclosan-coated polyglactin 910 sutures in the absence and presence of an additional antiplaque agent commonly used after oral surgery. materials and methods: triclosan-coated sutures were incubated for 4 hours in freshly collected human saliva and, when appropriate, subsequently treated with an antiplaque rinse containing chlorhexidine-cetyl pyridinium as active components. sutures without a triclosan-coating served as a control. results: triclosan-coated sutures harbored similar amounts of plaque as did uncoated sutures. exposure to the antiplaque rinse caused significant decreases in viable organisms for uncoated and triclosan-coated sutures. however, after application of the antiplaque rinse, more micro-organisms were found on triclosan-coated than on uncoated sutures. conclusion: sutures coated with triclosan do not provide a sufficient antimicrobial effect to prevent in vitro colonization by oral bacteria, whereas use in combination with a chlorhexidine-cetyl pyridinium-containing antiplaque rinse appears to be counterproductive.

TI  == microbial keratitis after intrastromal corneal ring segment implantation.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate the incidence of acute microbial keratitis after intrastromal corneal ring segment implantation and to investigate whether microbial keratitis is related to the intrastromal corneal ring type or surgical  technique. methods: intrastromal corneal ring segments were implanted in 212 eyes of 149 patients. two different types of intrastromal corneal ring segments were used during the study, intacs and ferrara rings, and two surgical techniques were used for intrastromal corneal ring segment implantation, manual and femtosecond laser. results: one hundred thirty-four eyes (63.2%) underwent intacs implantation and 78 (36.8%) eyes received ferrara rings. corneal tunnels were created using the manual technique in 119 (56.1%) eyes and by femtosecond laser in 93 (43.9%) eyes. three cases (1.4%) of acute microbial keratitis were clinically identified. cultures were positive in 2 eyes and negative in 1 eye, and polymerase chain reaction was positive in all 3 cases. the microorganisms isolated from cultures were streptococcus mitis and staphylococcus aureus. in 2 cases, the femtosecond laser technique was used (1 eye intacs, 1 eye ferrara), and in 1 case, the manual technique was used (intacs). no statistically significant difference was noted between techniques (p=.582) or segment type (p=1.000). in all cases, intrastromal corneal ring segments were explanted and intensive topical antibiotics were used with clinical success. conclusions: acute microbial keratitis incidence after intrastromal corneal ring segment implantation was 1.4%. gram-positive cocci were the organisms isolated more frequently. proper management of this condition requires intrastromal corneal ring segment explantation and intensive topical antibiotics.

TI  == comparative genomics and transduction potential of enterococcus faecalis temperate bacteriophages.
AB  == to determine the relative importance of temperate bacteriophage in the horizontal gene transfer of fitness and virulence determinants of enterococcus faecalis, a panel of 47 bacteremia isolates were treated with the inducing agents mitomycin c, norfloxacin, and uv radiation. thirty-four phages were purified from culture supernatants and discriminated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and  restriction mapping. from these analyses the genomes of eight representative phages were pyrosequenced, revealing four distinct groups of phages. three groups of phages, phifl1 to 3, were found to be sequence related, with phifl1a to c and  phifl2a and b sharing the greatest identity (87 to 88%), while phifl3a and b share 37 to 41% identity with phifl1 and 2. phifl4a shares 3 to 12% identity with the phages phifl1 to 3. the phifl3a and b phages possess a high dna sequence identity with the morphogenesis and lysis modules of lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris prophages. homologs of the streptococcus mitis platelet binding phage tail proteins, pbla and pblb, are encoded on each sequenced e. faecalis phage. few other phage genes encoding potential virulence functions were identified, and there was little evidence of carriage of lysogenic conversion genes distal to endolysin, as has been observed with genomes of many temperate phages from the opportunist pathogens staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. e. faecalis jh2-2 lysogens were generated using the eight phages, and these were examined for their relative fitness in galleria mellonella. several lysogens exhibited different effects upon survival of g. mellonella compared to their isogenic parent. the eight phages were tested for their ability to package host dna, and three were shown to be very effective for generalized transduction of naive host cells of the laboratory strains og1rf and jh2-2.

TI  == differentiation of streptococcus pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak isolates by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus [pnc]) is a causative agent of many infectious diseases, including pneumonia, septicemia, otitis media, and conjunctivitis. there have been documented conjunctivitis outbreaks in which nontypeable (nt), nonencapsulated pnc has been identified as the etiological agent. the use of mass spectrometry to comparatively and differentially analyze protein and peptide profiles of whole-cell microorganisms remains somewhat uncharted. in this report, we discuss a comparative proteomic analysis between nt s. pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak strains (cpnc) and other known typeable or  nt pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates (including pnc tigr4 and r6, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes) and nonstreptococcal isolates (including escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus) as controls. cpnc cells and controls were grown to mid-log phase, harvested, and subsequently treated with a 10% trifluoroacetic acid-sinapinic acid matrix mixture. protein and peptide fragments of the whole-cell bacterial isolate-matrix combinations ranging in size from 2 to 14 kda were evaluated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. additionally random forest analytical tools and dendrogramic representations (genesis) suggested similarities and clustered the isolates into distinct clonal groups, respectively. also, a peak list of protein and peptide masses was obtained and compared to a known pnc protein mass library, in which a peptide common and unique to cpnc isolates was tentatively identified. information gained from this  study will lead to the identification and validation of proteins that are commonly and exclusively expressed in cpnc strains which could potentially be used as a biomarker in the rapid diagnosis of pneumococcal conjunctivitis.

TI  == [periodontitis and cardiovascular disease].
AB  == the prevalence of periodontitis and cardiovascular disease (cvd) is high. a mixed infectious biofilm etiology of periodontitis is known but not fully established in cvd. cofactors; smoking habits, stress, ethnicity, genetics, socioeconomics and age contribute to both diseases. the objectives of this report are to summarize factors in regards to cvd and periodontitis that are clinically relevant. the hypothesis behind a relationship between the two conditions can be  founded in (i) shared infections etiology, (ii) shared inflammatory response, (iii) epidemiological and case-control studies, and (iv) periodontal studies demonstrating improvements of cvd markers. streptococcus species in the s. mitis  group, and s. anginosus group have been identified in periodontitis and are known as pathogens in endocarditis possibly transported from the oral cavity to the heart through bacteremia during dental therapies, and tooth brushing. other periodontal bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and parvimonas micra are beta-lactamase producing and may contribute to antibiotic resistance (extended spectrum beta-lactamases). other bacteria in cvd  and periodontitis include staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. chlamydia pneumoniae and p. gingivalis lipopolyysaccharide capsels share homology and induce heat-shock protein activity and a cascade of proinflammatory cytokines. associations between periodontitis and cvd have been presented in many studies when controlling for confounders. other studies have demonstrated that periodontal therapies increase brachial artery flow rate and reduce serum inflammatory cytokine levels. thus, physicians caring for subjects at cvd risk should consult with dentists/periodontists. dentists must improve their medical knowledge and also learn to consult with physicians when treating patients at cvd risk.

AB  == objectives: toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. this can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. in this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. methods: fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. microorganisms were enumerated and identified. bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated pbs solution  for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. results: counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) cfu. candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. no obligate anaerobes were isolated. members of streptococcaceae family were regularly found  (65.2%) belonging to the following species: streptococcus pyogenes, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. sobrinus, s. viridans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, aerococcus viridans. a. viridans and s. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were found on adults  brushes. escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. and enterococcus sp., were also recovered. we found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. however, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. conclusions: ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.

TI  == the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of abrus precatorius (l) fabaceae extract on  some clinical pathogens.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts  of abrus precatorius on some clinical isolates as resistance to available and affordable antibiotics by these pathogens is on the increase. method: in this study the antimicrobial effects of the extracts of abrus precatorius from leaves, stem and the seed oil were tested against staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, three clinical s. aureus isolates from different sources, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus anginosus (s.milleri), bacillus subtilis, corynebacterium spp (toxigenic strain of the mitis biotype), escherichia coli atcc 25922, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as candida albicans using the agar well diffusion technique. aqueous and methanolic extraction, using the soxhlet extractor was carried out on all plant parts used while petroleum ether was the solvent used to extract the seed oil. to measure the mic values, various concentrations of the stock, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 and 4 microg/ml were assayed against the test bacteria. result: at the  different concentrations of the extracts used (512 microg/ml - 4 microg/ml), staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive organism with an mic of 8 ug/ml for  the leaf extract. extract from the stem and seed oil were potent against some of  the gram-positive bacteria and candida albicans but not against s anginosus, e. faecalis and gram-negative bacteria tested. the ph of the extracts ranged between ph5 and ph8. this study demonstrates that abrus precatorius particularly the seed oil has a potent antimicrobial activity. conclusion: the results substantiate the ethno botanical use of different parts of abrus precatorius for the treatment of  various bacteria-related diseases. topical application of abrus precatorius extracts in ointments may be recommended especially for treating superficial infections caused by staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == coronal microleakage of two root-end filling materials using a polymicrobial marker.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate polymicrobial coronal leakage of mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) and amalgam. there were 108 single-rooted teeth  randomly divided into 3 groups of 32 teeth each and positive and negative control groups of 6 teeth and obturated with gutta percha and either diaket (3m/espe, seefeld, germany), ah plus (dentsply, de trey, konstanz, germany), or ketac endo  (3m/espe). these groups were further divided into 2 subgroups of 16 teeth in which root ends were resected and obturated with either mta or zinc-free amalgam. the samples have been incorporated in a dual-chamber leakage model with a polymicrobial marker of five facultative anaerobes on the coronal part. leakage was observing during a period of 90 days. the least leakage was found in a combination of diaket and mta (76.9 +/-14.8 days) followed by ah plus and mta (66.1 +/- 18.7), diaket and amalgam (60.0 +/- 23.1), ah plus and amalgam (56.9 +/- 22.1), and ketac endo and mta (42.1 +/- 17.8), whereas the greatest leakage was observed in the ketac endo and amalgam group (40.0 +/- 17.24). samples filled with mta showed significantly better sealing than samples filled with amalgam (p  < 0.05).

TI  == prevalence of bacteraemia following third molar surgery.
AB  == objective: to investigate the prevalence and aetiology of bacteraemia following third molar extractions (b-tme), analysing the factors affecting its development. methods: the study group was formed of 100 patients undergoing third molar extractions under general anaesthesia. peripheral venous blood samples were collected at baseline, 30 s after a mandibular third molar extraction and 15 min  after completing the final extraction. samples were inoculated into bactec aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles and were processed in the bact/alert. subculture and further identification of the bacteria isolated was performed using conventional microbiological techniques. results: the prevalence of bacteraemia following third molar surgery was 62% at 30 s after the first dental  extraction and 67% at 15 min after finishing the final extraction. the bacteria most frequently identified in the positive blood cultures were streptococcus viridans (87.9%). conclusion: in our series, the prevalence of b-tme at 30 s after a single third molar extraction was high, principally being of streptococcal aetiology, and was independent of the oral health status and the magnitude of the surgical procedure. positive blood cultures persisted for at least 15 min after three to four dental extractions in a higher number of patients, questioning the supposedly transient nature of bacteraemia following dental extractions.

TI  == infective endocarditis associated with spondylodiscitis and frequent secondary epidural abscess.
AB  == background: although many patients with ie complain of joint, muscle, and back pain, infections at these sights are rare. indeed, in patients with back pain and endocarditis, less than 4% actually demonstrate spondylodiscitis. case description: we recently encountered 4 patients with this complication, one each  caused by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus mitis, and enterococcus faecalis, and wondered whether the nature of the infecting organism  determined the development of spondylodiscitis and epidural abscess. in a literature review, 36 patients with endocarditis and spondylodiscitis were identified. only 9 (25%) were caused by streptococcus viridans and the remainder  by staphylococci, enterococci, and other streptococci. usually more than 50% of all cases of ie were caused by streptococcus viridans, although more recent studies would indicate an incidence of about 40%. conclusion: we conclude that spondylodiscitis with epidural abscess is more likely to occur in those patients  with endocarditis who are infected by organisms with pyogenic potential.

AB  == spondylodiscitis, a septic infection of the intervertebral disc spondylodiscitis, a septic infection of the intervertebral disc and adjacent vertebrae, is an unusual infection, mainly affecting children and elderly people. it is classically associated with tuberculosis, but other germs such as staphylococcus  aureus, streptococcus pyogenes or mitis, and some even more unususal ones (e.g. kingella kingae), are often encountered in our countries. non tuberculous spondylodiscitis is found in approximately 2% of pediatric bone infections. medullar compression and bone destruction can occur, especially when diagnosis is delayed, hence the value of early diagnosis and treatment. we report the case of  a non tuberculous spondylodiscitis occurring in a 22 month-old baby

TI  == fluorescence-based bacterial overlay method for simultaneous in situ quantification of surface-attached bacteria.
AB  == for quantification of bacterial adherence to biomaterial surfaces or to other surfaces prone to biofouling, there is a need for methods that allow a comparative analysis of small material specimens. a new method for quantification of surface-attached biotinylated bacteria was established by in situ detection with fluorescence-labeled avidin-d. this method was evaluated utilizing a silicon wafer model system to monitor the influences of surface wettability and roughness on bacterial adhesion. furthermore, the effects of protein preadsorption from serum, saliva, human serum albumin, and fibronectin were investigated. streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis, and staphylococcus aureus were chosen as model organisms because of their differing adhesion properties and their clinical relevance. to verify the results obtained by this new technique, scanning electron microscopy and agar replica plating were employed. oxidized and poly(ethylene glycol)-modified silicon wafers were found to be more resistant to  bacterial adhesion than wafers coated with hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon moieties. roughening of the chemically modified surfaces resulted in an overall increase in bacterial attachment. preadsorption of proteins affected bacterial adherence but  did not fully abolish the influence of the original surface chemistry. however, in certain instances, mostly with saliva or serum, masking of the underlying surface chemistry became evident. the new bacterial overlay method allowed a reliable quantification of surface-attached bacteria and could hence be employed  for measuring bacterial adherence on material specimens in a variety of applications.

TI  == [clinical results of resection arthroplasty for infected shoulder arthroplasty].
AB  == purpose of the study: infection is a rare complication of shoulder arthroplasty.  various therapeutic solutions have been proposed: antibiotics alone, one-stage or two-stage reimplantation, surgical or arthroscopic cleaning without prosthesis removal, scapulohumeral arthrodesis or simple arthroscopic resection. we evaluated the mid-term clinical outcome after resection arthroplasty for the treatment of infected shoulder arthroplasty. material and methods: the series included ten infected arthroplasties in ten patients. mean duration of implantation was two years seven months (range nine months to five years). bacteriological diagnosis was established from intraoperative articular samples or systematic samples taken during surgical revision procedures: meti-s staphylococcus aureus strains (n=4), coagulase-negative staphylococcus (n=5 including three s. epidermidis) streptococcus mitis (n=1) and citrobacter koseri  (n=1). the mean constant score before revision was 58 (range 23-77). subjective patient satisfaction before surgical revision was rated good in six cases, fair in one and poor in three. surgery associated removal of the implant, complete resection of the cement, resection of the fistular tracts, wide debridement of infected tissues and total synovectomy. results: patients were seen at an average follow-up of three years eight months. the objective functional outcome measured  with the constant score was only fair, 28 points (range 20.6-36), and corresponded to a loss of 29 points compared with the preoperative score. this was explained mainly by lower scores for joint motion, function and muscle force  but with persistently satisfactory scores for pain. all patients remained pain-free (daytime and nighttime). patient satisfaction was rated good for two, fair for five and mediocre for three. clinical and biological proof of eradicated infection was obtained in all patients. discussion: infection remains a serious devastating problem for shoulder arthroplasty with an important functional impact. resection only has a modest clinical effect. precise identification of the causal germ with institution of adapted antibiotic therapy is required for eradication of the infection. early diagnosis is probably the most important parameter affecting clinical outcome and surgical options. functional results after resection arthroplasty are modest. this procedure should be reserved for patients with reduced functional demands. improved management of the infectious load and reduction of diagnostic delay should help improve functional outcome and favor use of stow-stage procedures for reinsertion.

TI  == vancomycin tolerance, a potential mechanism for refractory gram-positive bacteremia observational study in patients with cancer.
AB  == background: the clinical significance of infections caused by vancomycin-tolerant (vt) gram-positive organisms in patients with cancer remains unclear. methods: twenty-five patients with nonenterococcal gram-positive bloodstream infection, which was refractory to vancomycin therapy, were identified by reviewing the infectious diseases consultation database at the tertiary care cancer center. among these, 8 patients in whom vancomycin-tolerance was documented are described. antibiotic tolerance was defined as a > 32 times increase in minimum bactericidal concentration compared with minimum inhibitory concentration. results: eight patients with persistent fever and bacteremia of > 72 hours' duration after the initiation of vancomycin therapy were treated. the median age  of these patients, which included 3 men and 5 women, was 44 years +/- 11 years. solid tumors were more common (6 patients) and 2 patients had acute leukemia. six patients (75%) were neutropenic (absolute neutrophil count < 500/mm3), including  2 breast cancer patients who had undergone autologous stem cell transplantation.  the causative organisms were staphylococcus aureus (n = 3 patients), group g streptococci (n = 2 patients), and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus sanguis (1 patient each). all isolates demonstrated a minimum bactericidal concentration for vancomycin that was at least 32 times greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration. rapid defervescence (< or = 24 h) and resolution of bacteremia occurred with the addition of gentamicin (4 patients) or gentamicin plus rifampin (4 patients). none of these infections recurred after discontinuation of therapy. conclusions: lack of clinical and/or microbiologic response to vancomycin should raise the suspicion of possible infection due to vt gram-positive bacteria, and alternative bactericidal therapy  should be instituted early, especially in patients with underlying immune suppression.

TI  == in vitro activity of daptomycin against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == we determined the activity of daptomycin, a recently fda-approved antimicrobial agent, against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria, including viridans group streptococci (16 streptococcus mitis species group, 12 s. mutans species group, 9 s. anginosus species group, 8 s. sanguinis species group, 5 s. salivarius species group) from patients with infective endocarditis, 32 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 32 high-level penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, 38 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (including 1 linezolid-resistant isolate), and the following unusual gram-positive bacteria: 3 listeria monocytogenes, 4 erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, 9 corynebacterium species, 10 abiotrophia/granulicatella species, 2 rothia (stomatococcus) mucilaginosus, and 4 gemella morbillorum. daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)(90) values for the viridans group streptococci, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, and enterococcus species were 0.5, 0.5, < or =0.125, and 4 microg/ml, respectively. the daptomycin mic range for the unusual gram-positive bacteria was < or =0.125-2 microg/ml. we conclude that daptomycin has in vitro activity against viridans group streptococci associated with endocarditis as well as against several types  of unusual gram-positive bacteria that can cause endocarditis.

TI  == in-house validation of the bactec 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: at present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the fda for the purpose of quality control (qc) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates: the bact/alert blood culture system (biomerieux) and the pall ebds (pall corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived plts. after the decision of the aabb to institute universal qc testing of plt concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the  performance of our current blood culture system, the bactec 9240, was carried out for this purpose. study design and methods: serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with plt contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis plt unit per organism. four ml of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (cfus) per ml was inoculated into blood culture bottles (standard 10 aerobic/f, becton-dickinson diagnostic systems) and incubated in a bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to  insure the identity of bacterial growth. results: with the exception of streptococcus mitis, the bactec system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 cfus per ml for staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the limit of detection for the  s. mitis test strain was 61 cfus per ml. detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis plt products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. conclusion: this study validates the use of the bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis plts in  less than 24 hours.

TI  == study of viridans streptococci and staphylococcus species in cleft lip and palate patients before and after surgery.
AB  == objective: to determine the effect of surgery on types and colony count of streptococcus and staphylococcus species in cleft lip and palate (clp) patients.  design: saliva samples were collected after the morning meal by placing a sterile cotton swab in the vestibule of the oral cavity from cleft lip and palate patients immediately preoperative and 12 weeks postoperative. normal children were examined as a control group. samples were cultured; staphylococcus and streptococcus isolates were identified and quantified. patients: fifteen cleft lip and palate patients and 22 normal children, aged 3 to 39 months were examined. results: streptococcus mitis biovar 1, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus oralis of the viridans group of streptococci were the most commonly found in normal children, as well as in cleft lip and palate children. in the cleft lip and palate group, mean streptococcal count was 32.41 (29.80) and 46.46  (42.80) in the pre- and postoperative periods, respectively; in the normal group, the count was 20.93 (27.93) and 49.92 (34.72) at 0 week and 12 weeks, respectively. staphylococcus aureus was the most common staphylococcus species found in clp patients, representing 47.4% postoperatively. in the cleft lip and palate children, mean staphylococcal count was 5.34 (8.13) and 0.56 (0.92) in the pre- and postoperative periods, respectively; in normal children, the count was 0.82 (1.98) and 0.60 (2.55) at 0 and 12 weeks, respectively. the differences were statistically significant only for the staphylococcal count between pre- and postoperative periods in children with cleft lip and palate as tested by analysis of variance (p < .05). conclusions: cleft lip and palate patients had more colonization by s. aureus compared with normal children, and the colony count decreased significantly following surgical repair of the cleft lip and palate.

TI  == [streptococcus salivarius meningitis after spinal anesthesia].
AB  == streptococcus salivarius is a usual commensal of skin, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, oral cavity and paranasal sinuses. although it is usually considered to have low virulence, s. salivarius may cause life-threatening infections, particularly endocarditis. on the other hand, bacterial meningitis after spinal anesthesia is very rare, there being some reported cases caused by s. salivarius, s. mitis, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. we report a 57 year old man who developed meningitis symptoms within 10 h of an uncomplicated inguinal herniorrhaphy performed during spinal anesthesia. cerebrospinal cultures grew s. salivarius sensitive to penicillin. the patient was successfully treated with penicillin g and left the hospital without sequelae. in the literature, bacterial meningitis due to s. salivarius is rarely  reported. of the 28 cases, 18 occurred after lumbar puncture for diagnostic or for spinal anesthesia, 5 occurred following a bacteriemia for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy or intestinal neoplasia, and the other 5 in patients who had dural defects. we discuss the possible etiological causes of the meningitis due to s. salivarius cases reports. the early recognition of this entity and the aseptic precautions likely to reduce the incidence of infectious complications after lumbar puncture are stressed.

TI  == efficacy of garenoxacin in treatment of experimental endocarditis due to staphylococcus aureus or viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the activity of garenoxacin was investigated in rats with experimental endocarditis due to staphylococci and viridans group streptococci (vgs). the staphylococci tested comprised one ciprofloxacin-susceptible and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) isolate (isolate 1112), one  ciprofloxacin-susceptible but methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) isolate (isolate p8), and one ciprofloxacin-resistant mutant (grla) of p8 (isolate p8-4). the vgs tested comprised one penicillin-susceptible isolate and one penicillin-resistant isolate (streptococcus oralis 226 and streptococcus mitis 531, respectively). to simulate the kinetics of drugs in humans, rats were infused intravenously with garenoxacin every 24 h (peak and trough levels in serum, 6.1 and 1.0 mg/liter, respectively; area under the concentration-time curve [auc], 63.4 mg. h/liter) or levofloxacin every 12 h (peak and trough levels in serum, 7.3 and 1.5 mg/liter, respectively; auc, 55.6 mg. h/liter) for 3 or 5 days. flucloxacillin, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone were used as control drugs. garenoxacin, levofloxacin, flucloxacillin, and vancomycin sterilized >/=70% of the vegetations infected with both ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylococcal isolates (p < 0.05 versus the results for the controls). garenoxacin and vancomycin also sterilized 70% of the vegetations infected with ciprofloxacin-resistant mrsa isolate p8-4, whereas treatment with levofloxacin failed against this organism (cure rate, 0%; p < 0.05 versus the results obtained with the comparator drugs). garenoxacin did not select for resistant derivatives  in vivo. in contrast, levofloxacin selected for resistant variants in four of six rats infected with mrsa isolate p8-4. garenoxacin sterilized 90% of the vegetations infected with both penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant isolates of vgs. levofloxacin sterilized only 22 and 40% of the vegetations infected with penicillin-susceptible s. oralis 226 and penicillin-resistant s. mitis 531, respectively. ceftriaxone sterilized only 40% of those infected with penicillin-resistant s. mitis 531 (p < 0.05 versus the results obtained with garenoxacin). no quinolone-resistant vgs were detected. in all the experiments successful quinolone treatment was predicted by specific pharmacodynamic criteria (d. r. andes and w. a. craig, clin. infect. dis. 27:47-50, 1998). the fact that the activity of garenoxacin was equal or superior to those of the standard comparators against staphylococci and vgs indicates that it is a potential alternative for the treatment of infections caused by such bacteria.

TI  == viridans streptococcus bacteremia in children on chemotherapy for cancer: an underestimated problem.
AB  == the authors discuss the morbidity associated with viridans streptococcus bacteremia, and its implications on the choice of antibiotics used as prophylaxis and treatment. they retrospectively studied the case notes of 38 children who were being treated for various malignant conditions in their unit and developed 40 episodes of bacteremia with viridans streptococci between october 1995 and january 1999. viridans streptococci were the third commonest blood culture isolate during this period, after coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus. the majority of the isolates were streptococcus mitis (55%). others were s. sanguis (25%), s. oralis (12.5%), s. salivarius (5%), and s. acidominimus (2.5%). twenty-five percent of the patients had been treated with regimens that included cytosine arabinoside, 60% were receiving prophylactic co-trimoxazole, and 87.5% were neutropenic. thirty percent of patients had abnormal chest x-rays, and 15% were hypotensive; 2 patients required admission to the intensive care unit. initial antibiotic therapy was changed because of failure of clinical response in 60% of cases, despite the infecting organism being sensitive in vitro. this study confirms the importance of viridans streptococci as a cause of bacteremia in pediatric hematology and oncology patients, leading to significant morbidity. further work is required to establish the optimal treatment for viridans streptococcus bacteremia.

AB  == background: in recent years, the diagnosis of infective endocarditis has been enhanced by the use of echocardiography. we sought, therefore, to review its effect on the management of endocarditis in children. methods: we reviewed all the patients presenting to our institution for evaluation for infective endocarditis from may 1994 to january 2002. the patients were stratified according to whether or not they had congenitally malformed hearts. results: of the 90 referred patients identified, 46 (51%) had positive ultrasonic findings. of these, we excluded 26 patients because of the presence of indwelling lines. the remaining 20 patients with features of endocarditis had a median age of 6.5 years, and a range from 0.14 to 8.5 years. there were 4 patients with normal hearts, and 16 with congenital cardiac malformations. we identified rupture of a  sinus of valsalva in four patients, with rupture into the left ventricle in two,  and into the right ventricle and right atrium in one each. the mitral valve was involved in six patients, the aortic valve in another six, including all four with rupture of the sinus of valsalva, both mitral and aortic valves in three, the pulmonary trunk in three patients, and the tricuspid valve and a blalock-taussig shunt in one patient each. organisms isolated included streptococcus mitis in 4 patients, streptococcus pneumoniae in 2 patients, streptococcus sanguis in 1, staphylococcus aureus in 3, staphylococcus epidermidis in 1, and enteroccocus in 2. cultures proved negative in 7 patients.  surgical intervention was needed in 12 patients, and one died (5%). only the left-sided chambers were involved in those with normal hearts. both patients infected with streptococcus pneumoniae had rupture of a sinus of valsalva. conclusion: involvement of the left-sided chambers is more likely in structurally normal hearts, and in cases with rupture of a sinus of valsalva, in which case infection with streptococcus pneumonia should be suspected.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacterial flora associated with chronically inflamed maxillary sinuses.
AB  == chronic maxillary sinusitis is a chronic inflammatory condition in which the role of microbial infection remains undefined. bacteria have been isolated from chronically inflamed sinuses; however, their role in the chronicity of inflammation is unknown. the objective of this study was to determine whether bacteria are present in clinical samples from chronic maxillary sinusitis and to  assess the diversity of the flora present. washes and/or tissue samples from endoscopic sinus surgery on 11 patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis were subjected to pcr amplification of bacterial 16s rdna using three universal primer pairs, followed by cloning and sequencing. the samples were also assessed for the presence of bacteria and fungi by conventional culture methods. viable bacteria and/or bacterial 16s rdna were detected from maxillary sinus samples of five of the 11 patients examined (45 %). three sinus samples were positive by both pcr and culture methods, one was positive only by pcr, and one only by culture. thirteen bacterial species were identified: abiotrophia defectiva, enterococcus avium, eubacterium sp., granulicatella elegans, neisseria sp., prevotella sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sp. fungi were not detected. in one  patient streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis, and in another patient pseudomonas aeruginosa, were detected from both the sinus and the oral cavity using species-specific pcr primers. these results suggest that both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria can be detected in nearly half of chronic maxillary sinusitis  cases.

TI  == inhibition by yeast killer toxin-like antibodies of oral streptococci adhesion to tooth surfaces in an ex vivo model.
AB  == background: monoclonal (ktmab) and recombinant (ktscfv) anti-idiotypic antibodies, representing the internal image of a yeast killer toxin, proved to be microbicidal in vitro against important eukaryotic and prokaryotic pathogens such as candida albicans, pneumocystis carinii, mycobacterium tuberculosis, staphylococcus aureus, s. haemolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae, including multidrug-resistant strains. ktmab and ktscfv exerted a strong therapeutic effect in well-established animal models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis. streptococcus mutans is the most important etiologic agent of dental caries that might result from the metabolic end products of dental plaque. effective strategies to reduce the disease potential of dental plaque have considered the possibility of using antibiotics or antibodies against oral streptococci in general and s. mutans in particular. in this study, the activity of ktmab and ktscfv against s. mutans and the inhibition and reduction by ktmab of dental colonization by s. mutans and other oral streptococci in an ex vivo model of human teeth were investigated. materials and  methods: ktscfv and ktmab were used in a conventional colony forming unit (cfu) assay against a serotype c strain of s. mutans, and other oral streptococci (s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius). an ex vivo model of human teeth submerged in saliva was used to establish ktmab potential of inhibiting or reducing the adhesion to dental surfaces by s. mutans and other oral streptococci. results: ktmab and ktscfv kill in vitro s. mutans and other oral streptococci. ktmab inhibit colonization of dental surfaces by s. mutans and oral streptococci in the ex vivo model. conclusions: killer antibodies with antibiotic activity or their engineered derivatives may have a potential in the prevention of dental caries in vivo.

TI  == a retrospective investigation of advanced periodontal disease as a risk factor for septicemia in hematopoietic stem cell and bone marrow transplant recipients.
AB  == objective: septicemia is a cause of death in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (hsct) recipients. extraction of teeth with advanced periodontitis has been advocated before hsct to prevent septicemia in myeloablated hosts. the primary aim of the present study was to determine impact of chronic periodontitis, as measured by radiographic alveolar bone loss, on septicemia and transplant mortality. study design: a retrospective design was used to study 77 subjects who received pretransplant dental evaluation, panoramic radiography, and full myeloablative allogeneic hsct to treat hematologic malignancies. radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss was measured with a schei ruler on all teeth. microorganisms isolated from positive blood cultures within the first 100 days after transplant were categorized as of likely origin from periodontal, oral, or  any body sites. spearman correlation and logistic regression analysis assessed associations between positive blood cultures, mean subject whole-mouth percent radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss, and 100-day survival. results: radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss per study subject averaged 13% +/- 7%, with 18.2% exhibiting bone loss of 20% or greater. during the initial 100 days after transplant, 63.6% subjects yielded septicemia-associated positive blood cultures, with staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli as the most common isolates recovered. no statistically significant associations were found between mean subject radiographic alveolar bone loss and septicemia of likely periodontal or oral origin. conclusion: in this preliminary study, no relationship was found between radiographic periodontal status and septicemia or  mortality within the initial 100 days after transplant. a larger-sized, prospective study is warranted to further delineate the risk of septicemia from periodontal and other oral diseases in immunocompromised patients.

TI  == effect of medium composition on the susceptibility of oral streptococci to mercuric chloride.
AB  == although there is considerable interest in identifying mercury-resistant bacteria, no standardized assay exists for this purpose. in this study, the effect of the composition of the medium on the susceptibility of oral streptococci to hgcl(2) was investigated. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of hgcl(2) for 52 streptococcal strains and the reproducibility of mic values for hg-sensitive and hg-resistant strains was determined with 11 different media. addition of blood increased the mic values, and some media (tryptone soya  agar, with or without blood) could not discriminate between hg-sensitive and hg-resistant strains. the proportion of streptococci that appeared to be resistant to hg was very high (>70%) on some media (mitis-salivarius, tryptone soya, columbia), but not on others (mueller-hinton, brain heart infusion, isosensitest). the mics of the control strains varied considerably on different testing occasions for tryptone soya agar (with and without blood), isosensitest agar, and columbia agar (with blood). mueller-hinton (without blood) appeared to  be the most suitable medium for isolating hg-resistant oral streptococci.

AB  == the value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the fundacion favaloro, the fundacion para la lucha contra las enfermedades neurologicas de la infancia and the hospital de ninos ricardo gutierrez. a total  of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). bact-alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees c for 30 days in the bact-alert system. bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and sabouraud agar. a total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. the positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). the median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. the microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), escherichia coli (n = 18), acinetobacter spp (n = 9), candida spp (n = 8), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), enterococcus faecalis, salmonella spp and capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecium, citrobacter diversus, candida albicans, klebsiella oxytoca, chryseomonas luteola, serratia marcescens, abiotrophia spp, campylobacter jejuni, moraxella catarrhalis, moraxella urethralis, neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group g streptococci, rhodococcus equi, micrococcus spp, cryptococcus neoformans  and streptococcus mitis (n = 1). in our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.

TI  == ib-367, a protegrin peptide with in vitro and in vivo activities against the microflora associated with oral mucositis.
AB  == although the microflora associated with oral mucositis initiated by cytotoxic therapy is not well characterized, several studies suggest that reduction of the  microbial load in the oral cavity has some clinical benefit. the mics of ib-367,  a synthetic protegrin analog, ranged from 0.13 to 64 microgram/ml for gram-positive bacteria (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, and staphylococcus aureus) and from 0.06 to 8 microgram/ml for gram-negative species (klebsiella, escherichia, and pseudomonas). ib-367 exhibited rapid, microbicidal activity against both log- and stationary-phase cultures of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and pseudomonas aeruginosa. at concentrations near the mics for these two organisms (4 and 2 microgram/ml, respectively), ib-367 reduced viability by more than 3 logs in less than 16 min. similarly, ib-367 effected a 4-log reduction of the endogenous microflora in pooled human saliva within 2 min at 250 microgram/ml, a concentration readily attained by local delivery. after nine serial transfers at  0.5x the mic, the mic of ib-367 for mrsa and p. aeruginosa increased only two to  four times. in a phase i clinical study with healthy volunteers, ib-367 was well  tolerated, with no detectable systemic absorption. one hour after treatment with  9 mg of ib-367, the prevalence of gram-negative bacteria and yeast was reduced, and the density of the predominant gram-positive oral flora was decreased 1,000 times. ib-367's properties (speed of killing, breadth of spectrum, and lack of resistance) make the compound a strong candidate for the prophylaxis of oral mucositis. phase ii clinical trials with ib-367 are under way for this indication in immunocompromised subjects.

TI  == efficacy of levofloxacin for experimental aortic-valve endocarditis in rabbits infected with viridans group streptococcus or staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == levofloxacin is among the more active fluoroquinolones against streptococci and staphylococci. it is effective against moderately severe infections caused by these organisms, but its efficacy in the treatment of bacteremia and serious infections such as endocarditis is not well defined. we compared the efficacy of  levofloxacin to those of standard agents in the rabbit model of aortic-valve endocarditis caused by fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains including a penicillin-susceptible strain of streptococcus sanguis, a penicillin-resistant strain of streptococcus mitis, a methicillin-resistant strain of staphylococcus aureus, and a methicillin-susceptible strain of s. aureus. levofloxacin administered intramuscularly at dosages of 20 to 40 mg/kg of body weight twice daily (b.i.d.) was completely ineffective against the penicillin-susceptible strain, with mean vegetation titers after 3 days of therapy not statistically significantly different from those for controls. levofloxacin was no more effective than penicillin against the penicillin-resistant strain. levofloxacin administered for 4 days at a dosage of 20 mg/kg b.i.d. was at least as effective  as vancomycin administered intravenously at a dosage of 25 mg/kg b.i. d. against  the methicillin-resistant s. aureus strain and was as effective as nafcillin administered intramuscularly at 100 mg three times daily against the methicillin-susceptible strain. emergence of resistance to levofloxacin in vitro  was less likely to occur than resistance to ciprofloxacin, and resistance to levofloxacin was not observed in vivo. levofloxacin-rifampin combinations were antagonistic in vitro and in vivo. levofloxacin was highly effective as a single  agent against experimental staphylococcal endocarditis but was surprisingly ineffective against streptococcal endocarditis, suggesting that it has a potential role as treatment for serious s. aureus but not viridans group streptococcal infections in humans.

TI  == spondylodiscitis caused by viridans streptococci: three cases and a review of the literature.
AB  == three cases of spondylodiscitis caused by viridans streptococci were observed within the course of 1 month. although streptococci have been reported as the third most frequent cause of spondylodiscitis after staphylococci and gram-negative bacteria, alpha-haemolytic streptococci are rarely seen. the three  patients presented with symptoms of low back pain; they felt well and did not have a fever or chills. laboratory examinations revealed inflammation. further examinations such as scintigraphy, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging were done. bacteriological diagnosis was established by blood cultures in two cases and by needle biopsy of the disco-vertebral space in one. in one patient endocarditis was also documented. because the prevalence of endocarditis  was found to be higher in our cases of spondylodiscitis due to streptococcus viridans than for other bacteria, the exclusion of this diagnosis must be pursued aggressively. these observations lead us to question if the spectrum of bacteria  causing spondylodiscitis is undergoing a change. an aetiological agent could be isolated in 1168 patients (85.4%): in 48% a staphylococcus, in 28% a gram-negative bacterium and in only 10% a streptococcus. there were two cases of  viridans streptococci (0.2%). these two cases together with other single case reports [14-22] account for 15 cases of spondylodiscitis due to alpha-haemolytic  streptococci. differentiation of the organisms to the species level was accomplished in six cases: s. mitis (3), s. sanguis (2) and s. anginosus (1). although a multitude of organisms, bacterial as well as fungal, causing spondylodiscitis has been reported in recent years, almost all were single cases  [23-42]. the unusual observation of three cases of spondylodiscitis due to alpha-haemolytic streptococci within 1 month prompted us to review the clinical and laboratory findings and to compare these cases with those caused by staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == increased interleukin-6, interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor-alpha production by tonsillar mononuclear cells stimulated with alpha-streptococci in patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris.
AB  == in vitro cytokine production by tonsillar mononuclear cells under culture conditions with or without lyophilized streptococcal antigens was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). under culture conditions without any stimulus, a certain amount of interferon (ifn)-gamma, tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, and interleukin (il)-6, was detected in the supernatant culture fluids from all 29 donors tested and just detectable levels of il-1alpha and il-2 were identified in 5 of 12 donors tested; but il-4 and il-5 were not detected in  any supernatants from 21 donors tested. in 16 patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (ppp), all three alpha-streptococcal antigens from streptococcus, (s.) sanguis, s. salivarius and s. mitis induced production of il-6. ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha by tonsillar mononuclear cells at a significant level. however, no  significant induction of such cytokines by alpha-streptococcal stimulus was seen  in 13 donors without ppp. no significant difference in cytokine production by tonsillar mononuclear cells was seen between the ppp and non-ppp subjects, when stimulated with s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus cowan i and pokeweed mitogen.  in the experiments using tonsillar cell subsets, the cytokine inductions by alpha-streptococcal stimulus were found in monocyte-depleted cells as well as in  purified t-cells. but not in b-cells. these data suggest that il-6, ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha may play an important role in immunological reactions in the tonsils and that a hyper-immune response to some of alpha-streptococcal antigens through  increased production of such cytokines by tonsillar mononuclear cells, to which t-cells mainly contribute, may play a key role in the pathogenesis of ppp.

TI  == efficacy of trovafloxacin in treatment of experimental staphylococcal or streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  == the efficacy of trovafloxacin against staphylococcus aureus and viridans group streptococci was investigated in vitro and in an experimental model of endocarditis. the mics at which trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin inhibited 90% of  clinical isolates of such bacteria (mic90s) were (i) 0.03 and 2 mg/liter, respectively, for 30 ciprofloxacin-susceptible s. aureus isolates, (ii) 32 and 128 mg/liter, respectively, for 20 ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus isolates, and (iii) 0.25 and 8 mg/liter, respectively, for 28 viridans group streptococci.  rats with aortic vegetations were infected with either of two ciprofloxacin-susceptible but methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains (strains col and p8), one penicillin-susceptible streptococcus sanguis strain, or one penicillin-resistant streptococcus mitis strain. rats were treated for 3 or 5 days with doses that resulted in kinetics that simulated those achieved in humans with trovafloxacin (200 mg orally once a day), ciprofloxacin (750 mg orally twice a day), vancomycin (1 g intravenously twice a day), or ceftriaxone (2 g intravenously once a day). against the staphylococci, the activities of both trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin were equivalent to that of vancomycin, and treatment of endocarditis with these drugs was successful (p < 0.05). however, ciprofloxacin selected for resistant derivatives in vitro and in vivo, whereas trovafloxacin was 10 to 100 times less prone than ciprofloxacin to select for resistance in vitro and did not select for resistance in vivo. against the two streptococcal isolates, trovafloxacin significantly (p < 0.05) decreased bacterial counts in the vegetations but was less effective than the control drug, ceftriaxone. thus, a simulated oral dose of trovafloxacin (200 mg per day) was effective against ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylococci and was less likely than ciprofloxacin to select for resistance. the simulated oral dose of trovafloxacin also had some activity against streptococcal endocarditis, but optimal treatment of infections caused by such organisms might require higher doses of the drug.

TI  == detection of bacteraemia in patients with fever and neutropenia using 16s rrna gene amplification by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == episodes of fever and neutropenia are common complications of treatment for cancer. the use of prophylactic and early empirical antibiotics has reduced mortality but decreases the sensitivity of diagnostic tests based on culture. the aim of this study was to determine the potential of a broad diagnostic approach (eubacterial) based on 16s rrna gene amplification and sequencing to augment cultural methods of diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients with fever and neutropenia in a regional paediatric oncology centre. one hundred eleven patient-episodes of fever and neutropenia were evaluated during the study period, 17 of which were associated with positive blood cultures, as follows: staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 6 episodes), enterococcus faecium (n = 2), streptococcus sanguis (n = 3), streptococcus mitis (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), micrococcus spp. (n = 1), and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 1). eubacterial polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detected bacterial dna in nine of 11  blood culture-positive episodes for which a sample was available for pcr; the species identified by sequence analysis were identical to those derived from the  conventional identification of the cultured isolates. bacterial dna was detected  in 20 episodes (21 bacterial sequences) associated with negative blood cultures,  18 of which occurred in patients who were receiving antibiotics at the time of sample collection. the species presumptively identified by partial 16s rrna gene  sequencing were as follows: pseudomonas spp. (n = 6 episodes), acinetobacter spp. (n =5 ); escherichia spp. (n = 3); moraxella spp. (n = 3); staphylococcus spp. (n = 2); neisseria spp. (n = 1); and bacillus spp. (n = 1). the results of this study suggest that molecular techniques can augment cultural methods in the diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients who have been treated with antibiotics.

AB  == the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin was compared with that of other widely  used antibiotics against 355 strains isolated from patients with endocarditis. mics were determined by a standard agar dilution method. quinupristin/dalfopristin was inhibitory at 1 mg/l for all coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 36) and for the majority of staphylococcus aureus strains (n = 87). the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against 186 viridans streptococci  was somewhat dependent on the species, with mic50s ranging from 0.5 to 2 mg/l, being least active against streptococcus bovis and most active against streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mitis. for the staphylococci, quinupristin/dalfopristin was as active against erythromycin-susceptible as erythromycin-resistant strains. viridans streptococci showed a slight but significant correlation between sensitivity to erythromycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin. it is concluded that quinupristin/dalfopristin has the potential to treat serious infections such as endocarditis caused by gram-positive cocci.

TI  == evaluation of swirling, ph, and glucose tests for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: although infrequent, episodes of transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis may lead to serious outcomes or death and therefore are of concern. this study evaluates the sensitivity of three surrogate tests for the presence of bacteria in platelet concentrates: cessation of swirling, low extracellular ph, and low plasma glucose levels. study design and methods: day 0 platelet concentrates were inoculated with low levels of one of seven bacterial strains and stored with agitation at 20 to 24 degrees c for up to 5 days. in the morning  and afternoon of each day of storage, bacterial levels were ascertained by quantitative plate culture, and platelet concentrates were tested for platelet ph, plasma glucose, and swirling. quantitative and semiquantitative dipstick techniques were used to determine ph and glucose levels. results: platelet concentrates had attained stationary phase growth of streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus mitis, or staphylococcus epidermidis (> or = 10(7) -10(8) colony-forming units [cfu]/ml) before either the swirling or dipstick methods suggested the presence of bacteria. the sensitivity of swirling and glucose tests for detecting bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates was generally comparable. although the sensitivity of the ph test was generally similar to that of swirling and glucose tests for most bacteria, platelet concentrates contaminated with e. cloacae had normal ph despite the presence of high levels of bacteria (> or = 10(7)-10(8) cfu/ml). conclusion: the sensitivity in detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates by the swirling technique or by measuring extracellular ph or plasma glucose is less than the sensitivity reported for microscopy with gram stain (10(5)-10(6) cfu/ml), fluorescence microscopy with acridine orange stain (10(4)-10(5) cfu/ml), chemiluminescence detection of ribosomal rna (10(3)-10(4) cfu/ml), and automated bacterial culture (1 cfu/sample volume).

TI  == the interference of gingival cell cultures with growth of selected bacteria.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to analyze the interference of oral tissue cells or cell lines (effector cells) with growth of reference bacteria, and furthermore to investigate whether cells derived from different individuals differ in such activity. the reference bacteria were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the effector cells used were gingival fibroblasts (gf) from 21 periodontally involved persons, gingival epithelial cells (e) from 2 such persons, hela cells (hela), and an amnion cell line (amnion). the cells were cultivated and their supernatants tested for antibacterial activity in a bioscreen robot analyzer (labsystems, finland). results suggest that the antibacterial activity of each tested primary cell line  of tissue had its own profile depending on cell type and donor, and that the composition of oral microbiota was influenced by oral cells, which might, in turn, contribute to the variations in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.

TI  == induction of lymphocytes cytotoxic to oral epithelial cells by streptococcus mitis superantigen.
AB  == the preparation of a superantigenic fraction f-2 from the culture supernatant of  streptococcus mitis 108, a fresh isolate from human tooth surfaces, was reported  previously. now, to determine the possible pathogenic role of the superantigen in oral mucosal diseases, we examined the cytotoxic effects of human peripheral blood t-cells activated with f-2 on human oral epithelial cells. t-cells activated with f-2 were cytotoxic to the human squamous carcinoma ho-1-n-1 cells  derived from the oral mucosa, similar to those activated with staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin b (seb). this cytotoxic effect was increased in a dose-dependent manner by the addition of the respective stimulant, f-2 or seb, to the cytotoxic assay system. f-2 endowed mainly cd8+ t-cells with cytotoxic activity. pretreatment with human interferon gamma increased the sensitivity of the ho-1-n-1 cells to the cytotoxic effects of f-2-activated t-cells. the f-2-activated t-cells were also cytotoxic to human keratinocytes derived from gingiva. there was no correlation between the degree of cytotoxicity and the levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha in co-cultures of f-2-activated t-cells and ho-1-n-1 cells. a double-chamber plate experiment revealed no cytotoxic effects when the f-2-activated t-cells were separated from the ho-1-n-1 cells. supernatants of the co-cultures of target and effector cells were not cytotoxic to ho-1-n-1 cells. these findings suggest that the cytotoxic effects of the f-2-activated t-cells on ho-1-n-1 cells were mediated not by soluble factors but  by the direct interaction between the activated t-cells and the target cells. the cytotoxicity of the f-2-activated t-cells against ho-1-n-1 cells was markedly inhibited by monoclonal antibodies (mabs) against cd11a and cd54, but was only slightly inhibited by mabs against human leukocyte antigen (hla)-dr and cd2. thus, the interaction between lymphocyte-function-associated antigen-1 (lfa-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (icam-1) was crucial for the f-2-dependent  t-cell-mediated cytotoxicity against oral epithelial cells, while hla-dr and cd2  molecules are not necessarily involved in the cytotoxicity observed.

TI  == antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  == in addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. this investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol,  super eba and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli b and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella (bacteroides) intermedia, prevotella (bacteroides) melaninogenica, fusobacterium  necrophorum, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. after growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials  were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees c. impregnated discs with the super eba liquid were used as positive controls. the antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials.  impregnated discs with super eba liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. zinc  oxide-eugenol and super eba pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == bacterial interference in vitro. comparison between a quantitative kinetic and a  cocultivation blood agar test method.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to compare two methods for estimation of bacterial growth interference between various bacteria using a bioscreen robot analyzer, allowing kinetic documentation, and a cocultivation test on blood agar  plates. six laboratory strains with different virulence and growth requirements were used: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mitis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. the interference activity was correlated with a reference system of streptococcus sanguis (strain alpha 89) and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococci, gas serotypes t 9 and t 22). the methods used and results obtained were as follows: 1. estimation of synergistic and antagonistic bacterial interferences using a bioscreen robot analyzer. suspensions of viable bacteria were added to microtiter plates with different concentrations of uv light-killed bacteria in liquid media. the bioscreen analyzer monitored bacterial growth every 10 min for 24 h giving kinetic data during the growth period. synergisms as well as antagonisms were demonstrated between the tested bacterial  strains which have not earlier been reported in the literature. however, the antagonistic effect observed between the six strains was less than that induced by the s. sanguis strain on the two strains of s. pyogenes. 2. cocultivation of bacterial strains on blood agar surface with precultivated or simultaneously stamped interfering bacteria indicated no detectable interference between the six tested bacterial strains, while the s. sanguis strain inhibited the growth of s.  pyogenes strains as well as the hemolysis around the colonies. the bioscreen method was found more sensitive for testing bacterial interference compared to the commonly used blood agar test.

TI  == cytotoxicity in bacterial cultures: interaction and cell-specificity, possible factors in periodontal disease.
AB  == cytotoxicity in culture media of various growing bacterial strains was estimated  by cr-51 release of labelled target-cells. interaction studies were made by adding each of the different uv-killed bacteria to the medium with viable bacteria. the reference oral bacterial strains were: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus mitis, which were compared with the reference bacteria staphylococcus aureus 209 and staphylococcus epidermidis. the target cells were:  gingival fibroblasts (gf), periodontal membrane fibroblasts (pmf), pulpal fibroblasts (pf), hela-cells (hela), and lymphoid neoplasm cells (ln). synergistic, as well as antagonistic, effects on target cells were observed. the  cytotoxicity of a. actinomycetemcomitans in presence of p. gingivalis is neutralized while in presence of s. aureus it was increased. bacterial interactions with f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis cytotoxicity were observed. the  cytotoxicity of f. nucleatum was increased when cultured together with a. actinomycetemcomitans. each cell type reacted differently to the toxicity of the  supernatant of growth medium in which the same bacterial strain had been cultivated, which indicates cell specificity of the toxins.

TI  == microorganisms on toothbrushes at day-care centers.
AB  == the microflora on 44 toothbrushes at 4 day-care centers in the city of goteborg have been investigated as a presumptive risk factor for transmission of microorganisms by children. non-supervised toothbrushing without the use of toothpaste was performed at the day-care centers twice a day. streptococci, predominantly s. salivarius, s. sanguis, and s. mitis, were the most frequently recorded group of microorganisms and generally constituted the greatest part of the flora (on average, 50%). beta-hemolytic streptococci were not found in any sample. haemophilus species were noted in 82% of the samples. h. parainfluenzae being the most frequent, and h. influenzae being identified in only one sample. anaerobes constituted on average a third of the microflora. staphylococci were identified in 86% of the samples, s. epidermidis dominating. fungi including molds were found in 50% of the samples, and from one day-care center large numbers of enteric organisms were identified. thus this study shows that unsupervised toothbrushing at day-care centers can be questioned, more from a general hygienic point of view than from the risk of transmitting serious pathogens.

TI  == inhibition of microbial adherence by sphinganine.
AB  == sphingosines (precursors and degeneration products of complex sphingolipids) are  mediators in membrane second-messenger cascades and in a wide variety of functions in eukaryotic cells. sphingosines are also lethal for gram-positive microorganisms. in addition to its direct effect, sphinganine is here reported to affect the adherence of streptococcus mitis to buccal epithelial cells and of staphylococcus aureus to nasal mucosal cells after incubation for 90 min at 37 degrees c. when the bacteria were pretreated with 8.1, 16.2, 32.5, or (for strep. mitis) 65 microm sphinganine for 60 min at 37 degrees c, adherence counts were reduced for staph. aureus by 27, 37, and 60% and for strep. mitis by 19, 44, 54,  and 73%, respectively (p < 0.001). in contrast, pretreatment of buccal cells with 81.2 microm lipid increased adherence by 14% (p < 0.01), but no change occurred at either 16.2 or 325 microm lipid. these results further demonstrate the double-edged ability of sphingosines to regulate cellular activities and their potential as multifunctional therapeutic agents for infectious diseases.

TI  == prophylactic teicoplanin during insertion of hickman catheters.
AB  == with the extensive use of hickman catheters in patients requiring cytotoxic chemotherapy there is now a resurgence of gram-positive septicaemia among these patients during the neutropenic periods. we are currently running a prospective randomized study of prophylactic teicoplanin during insertion of hickman catheters to determine if it reduces the incidence of gram-positive septicaemia.  a total of 44 patients have completed the study (23 in the teicoplanin group and  21 in the control group). the diagnoses were: acute myelogenous leukaemia (13), non-hodgkin's lymphoma (16), hodgkin's disease (11), chronic granulocytic leukaemia (3) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (1). the number of days between insertion of hickman catheters and the development of neutropenia was: teicoplanin group: mean 14.7, median 11, range 0-53; control group: mean 11.8, median 10, range 0-37. in the treated patients, there were four episodes of line-associated gram-positive septicaemia and a total of four organisms were isolated. in the control group, 10 organisms were isolated from a total of nine episodes of line-associated gram-positive septicaemia. the organisms were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (8), streptococcus b, (1), strep. faecalis (1),  strep. mitis (1), alpha streptococcus (1), diphtheriods (1) and staphylococcus aureus (1). all organisms were sensitive to teicoplanin. no adverse reaction was  observed in any patient. prophylactic teicoplanin during insertion of hickman catheters may therefore reduce the incidence of line-associated gram-positive septicaemia in neutropenic patients.

TI  == etiologic diagnosis of pneumonia by antigen detection: crossreactions between pneumococcal c-polysaccharide and oral microorganisms.
AB  == crossreactions between bacteria occurring more or less frequently in the respiratory tract were investigated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) developed for the detection of pneumococcal c-polysaccharide. a collection of 218 strains was investigated: 30 streptococcus pneumoniae, 120 alpha-streptococci, and 68 strains representing other species. strong crossreactions were observed with 36% of the alpha-streptococci and with two of 11 staphylococcus aureus strains. the collection of alpha-streptococci consisted  of 90 fresh clinical isolates and 30 stock strains. almost all crossreactions of  alpha-streptococci were found among the clinical isolates. among the stock strains only one of four streptococcus mitis strains was positive. pneumococcal c-polysaccharide and phosphorylcholine inhibited the reactions in elisa with monoclonal antibodies against pneumococcal c-polysaccharide, as well as with a polyclonal antiserum against pneumococcal c-polysaccharide. we suggest that the cross reactions between alpha-streptococci and pneumococci depend on the presence of phosphorylcholine as a common antigenic determinant. the crossreaction in the  elisa with some staphylococcus aureus strains may be explained by the presence of protein a binding to the fc portion of the antibodies. when the 10 alpha-streptococci that showed the strongest crossreactions and ten pneumococci representing different types were tested in different concentrations the absorbance values were lower for most alpha-streptococci compared with the pneumococci. this explains that false positive results with alpha-streptococci do not seem to constitute a practical problem in this elisa developed for detection  of pneumococcal c-polysaccharide in samples from patients with pneumonia.

TI  == inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis by soluble bacterial products.
AB  == bacterial-neutrophil interactions may be critical determinants of virulence in periodontal diseases. this study was undertaken to examine the ability of major bacterial species from the human oral cavity to inhibit (1) peripheral blood neutrophil chemotaxis, (2) chemotactic formylmethionyl peptide binding, and (3) phagocytosis. included were cultured supernatants and sonic extracts obtained from strains of capnocytophaga, bacteroides gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum,  bacteroides asaccharolyticus, capnocytophaga species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, neisseria, actinomyces viscosus, bacterionema matruchotii, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sanguis. chemotaxis  was measured using boyden chambers; phagocytosis was determined using staphylococcus aureus as the indicator organism and radioactive chemotactic peptide binding was assessed by a rapid filtration assay. none of the test organisms were cytotoxic to neutrophils or inhibited neutrophil phagocytosis. capnocytophaga species., bacteroides species., a. actinomycetemcomitans, and f. nucleatum produced factors which specifically inhibited neutrophil chemotaxis. activity was lost after dialysis. extracts of bacteroides species, a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum, which were not chemotactic by themselves, inhibited binding of chemotactic peptide suggesting that in vitro chemotaxis inhibition was mediated by nonchemotactic components that compete for the chemotactic factor receptor on the neutrophil. the exception was capnocytophaga which appeared to inhibit chemotaxis by inhibition of a post-binding event. such  chemotactic inhibitors from periodontopathic organisms that inhibit neutrophil function may be important determinants of virulence.

TI  == increased bactericidal activity of dilute preparations of povidone-iodine solutions.
AB  == recent confirmation of intrinsic bacterial contamination of 10% povidone-iodine solution has raised questions regarding the bactericidal mechanism of iodophors and the possibility for survival of vegetative bacterial cells in iodophor solutions. in this laboratory investigation, five different species were exposed  to various dilutions of three commercial preparations of 10% povidone-iodine solution; survival was assessed after exposure for time periods varying between 0 and 8 min. all brands of povidone-iodine solution tested demonstrated more rapid  killing of staphylococcus aureus and mycobacterium chelonei at dilutions of 1:2,  1:4, 1:10, 1:50, and 1:100 than did the stock solutions, s. aureus survived a 2-min exposure to full-strength povidone-iodine solution but did not survive a 15-s exposure to a 1:100 dilution of the iodophor. both stock and dilute preparations of 10% povidone-iodine solution demonstrated rapid bactericidal action against klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas cepacia, and streptococcus mitis.

TI  == examination of streptococcus mutans for immunoglobulin g fc reactivity.
AB  == representative strains of oral streptococci were tested for fc immunoglobulin g (igg) reactivity by two different techniques, agglutination of rabbit-igg sensitized sheep erythrocytes and uptake of human and rabbit 125i-radiolabeled igg. none of the s. mutans serotypes a through e reacted with the fc region of either human or rabbit igg. additionally, other streptococci such as s. sanguis,  s. salivarius, s. faecalis, and s. mitis failed to show appreciable fc reactivity as assayed by these techniques. the group a, c, and g streptococci, previously shown to possess fc reactivity, proved to be reactive in these experiments, as did a protein a-containing strain of staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == effect of human saliva on glucose uptake by streptococcus mutans and other oral microorganisms.
AB  == we examined the effects of human whole salivary supernatant and parotid fluid on  glucose uptake by streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. the following three effects of saliva were observed: (i) inhibition of glucose uptake (s. mutans, s. sanguis), (ii) promotion of a transient, rapid (0 to 30 s) burst of glucose uptake (s. mutans, s. sanguis), and (iii) enhancement of glucose uptake (s. mitis, a. viscosus, s. aureus, e. coli). we observed no differences between the effects of whole salivary supernatant and the effects of parotid fluid. heat treatment (80 degrees c, 10 min) of saliva or the addition of dithiothreitol abolished inhibition of glucose uptake. supplementation of saliva  with h(2)o(2) potentiated inhibition of glucose uptake. s. mitis and a. viscosus, which were stimulated by saliva alone, were inhibited by h(2)o(2)-supplemented saliva; 50% inhibition of glucose uptake by s. mutans and s. mitis required ca. 10 mum h(2)o(2) in 50% (vol/vol) saliva. loss of the inhibitory action of saliva  occurred at about 5% (vol/vol) saliva. supplementation of saliva dilutions with scn(-) and h(2)o(2) extended the inhibitory activity to solutions containing ca.  0.2% (vol/vol) saliva. we suggest that the salivary lactoperoxidase-scn(-)-h(2)o(2) system is responsible for the inhibitory activity of saliva reported here. furthermore, we concluded that lactoperoxidase and scn(-) are present in saliva specimens in concentrations that exceed minimal inhibitory levels by factors of ca. 500 and 10 to 20, respectively. the resistance of a. viscosus, s. aureus, and e. coli to the inhibitory potential of  saliva alone was probably due to the production of catalase by these organisms. the resistance of s. mitis may have been due to special effects of saliva on h(2)o(2) accumulation by this organism compared with s. mutans and s. sanguis. the basis of saliva-dependent enhancement of glucose uptake and the basis of promotion of a transient, rapid burst of glucose uptake are unknown. the role of  the salivary lactoperoxidase-scn(-)-h(2)o(2) system in the oral microbial ecosystem is discussed.

TI  == epidemiologic studies among amerindian populations of amazonia. i. pyoderma: prevalence and associated pathogens.
AB  == pyoderma was studied among a representative sample of the residents of four remote amerindian villages, amazonas state, brazil, during july-august 1976. the  overall prevalence among the 775 inhabitants examined was 11%, with little intervillage variation. when the attack rates for the entire sample population were calculated by 5-year age intervals, the 0- to 4-year-olds had the highest rate, 31%. the highest prevalence, 38%, was found among 3-year-olds. attack rates were not apparently related to sex. cultures which were taken from representative pyoderma lesions from people in the four survey villages and from three additional villages were studied by a modified delayed culture technique for recovery of gram-positive pathogens from silica-gel desiccated swabs. group a and group g b-hemolytic streptococci, coagulase positive staphylococcus aureus, and corynebacterium diphtheriae were isolated. group a s. pyogenes was most commonly  found, occasionally as the sole pathogenic species. no nephritogenic m-types were found, although most isolates were not m-typable. the t-types found corresponded  to those previously reported as being pyoderma-associated. most pyoderma-associated c. diphtheriae isolates were non-toxigenic. biotypes gravis and mitis were equally represented.

TI  == rat model of experimental endocarditis.
AB  == a simple model of infective endocarditis was produced in rats. with the aid of a  guide wire, polyethylene catheters were passed into the left ventricle through the right carotid artery of sprague-dawley rats weighing 300 to 350 g. a volume of 1 ml of an overnight culture of streptococcus mitis, staphylococcus aureus, or streptococcus faecalis was intravenously injected 1 to 2 days after catheterization. bacterial titers of streptococcus mitis in vegetations were about 10(4)-fold greater than in other tissues. blood cultures were always positive after 6 h. mortality was 19% at 1 week and 82% at 2 weeks. catheters were pulled 24 h after infection, and vegetation titers of greater than 7.0 log10 colony-forming units per g were sustained at 5 days. in intravenously infected rats without catheters, blood and tissues were sterile after 3 to 5 days. with staphylococcus aureus, vegetations had greater than 9.0 log10 colony-forming units and with streptococcus faecalis 8.8 +/- 0.3 log10 colony-forming units per  g at 2 days. the rat model of infective endocarditis should prove to be suitable  for further pathological and therapeutic studies.

TI  == new method for the isolation of streptococcus mutans and its differentiation from other oral streptococci.
AB  == a new, improved agar medium for the isolation of streptococcus mutans, the etiological agent of dental caries, was developed. in contrast to mitis-salivarius agar, this medium not only recovers a greater number of s. mutans strains from most oral specimens but, because of its mannitol and sorbitol content, it also facilitates the differentiation of s. mutans from other oral streptococci, e.g., s. salivarius, s. mitis, and s. sanguis, which do not grow or produce scanty growth only after 10 days of incubation. the medium is easy to prepare because of its simple and unique composition, is characterized by the presence of an acid indicator, and can be utilized under aerobic and anaerobic conditions as well. the medium cannot be used to distinguish among the eight serotypes, a to g and sl-1, of s. mutans. mannitol-utilizing bacteria such as streptococci (e.g., s. faecalis) and other microorganisms (e.g., staphylococcus aureus) are able to grow on this medium and can be distinguished from s. mutans by their unique colony morphology.

TI  == a peroxidase-mediated, streptococcus mitis-dependent antimicrobial system in saliva.
AB  == h(2)o(2) formation by streptococcus mitis was measured by the catalase-dependent  conversion of [(14)c]formate to (14)co(2) ; it was optimal at ph 6.0-6.5 and required glucose. the h(2)o(2) formed by s. mitis could be employed as a component of an antimicrobial system that also included lactoperoxidase (lpo) and either iodide or thiocyanate ions in the concentrations present in saliva. the antimicrobial effect of the lpo-iodide-s. mitis system was measured by the decrease in the viable cell count of the target organisms (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, candida tropicalis). the antimicrobial effect of the lpo-thiocyanate-s. mitis system was measured by the decrease in the rate of growth or the rate of uptake of [(14)c]valine by the target organisms (e. coli, s. aureus). mixed or parotid saliva could replace lpo and thiocyanate ions in the s. mitis-dependent inhibition of bacterial growth and valine uptake. the presence in saliva of a peroxidase-mediated, antimicrobial system dependent on microbial metabolism for h(2)o(2) and its role as a natural host defense mechanism are considered.

TI  == cores, microbial organelles possibly specific to group d streptococci.
AB  == a long, thin, approximately cylindrical core spans the interior of cells of 24-hr cultures of all group d streptococci that were examined, five strains of streptococcus faecalis, single strains of s. faecalis subsp. zymogenes and s. durans, and three strains of streptococcus spp. in one strain of s. faecalis, serial section electron microscopy showed that most cells possess a core. the core is 0.10 to 0.16 mum thick and consists of a matrix and an axial array of ribosomelike particles. it resembles one of two types of cores present in a stable protoplast form of one of the s. faecalis strains. cores were not present  in single strains of s. pyogenes (beta-hemolytic group a), s. agalactiae (group b), s. dysgalactiae (group c), s. equisimilis (group c), and s. mitis (viridans group) that were examined; nor were cores observed in single strains of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and bacillus megaterium. cores may be useful, therefore, in identification of group d streptococci. for preservation and rapid recognition of cores, a glutaraldehyde-osmium tetroxide sequence of fixation appears superior to the osmium tetroxide method often employed in processing bacteria for electron microscopy.
