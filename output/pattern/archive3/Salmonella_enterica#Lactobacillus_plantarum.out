identification and antimicrobial activity detection of lactic acid bacteria isolated from corn stover silage.
a total of 59 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains were isolated from corn stover silage. according to phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) sequences and reca gene polymerase chain reaction amplification, these lab isolates were identified as five species: lactobacillus (l.) plantarum subsp. plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, enterococcus mundtii, weissella cibaria and leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, respectively. those strains were also screened for antimicrobial activity using a dual-culture agar plate assay. based on excluding the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide, two l. plantarum subsp. plantarum strains zzu 203 and 204, which strongly inhibited salmonella enterica atcc 43971(t), micrococcus luteus atcc 4698(t) and escherichia coli atcc 11775(t) were selected for further research on sensitivity of the antimicrobial substance to heat, ph and protease. cell-free culture supernatants of the two strains exhibited strong heat stability (60 min at 100 degrees c), but the antimicrobial activity was eliminated after treatment at 121 degrees c for 15 min. the antimicrobial substance remained active under acidic condition (ph 2.0 to 6.0), but became inactive under neutral and alkaline condition (ph 7.0 to 9.0). in addition, the antimicrobial activities of these two strains decreased remarkably after digestion by protease k. these results preliminarily suggest that the desirable antimicrobial activity of strains zzu 203 and 204 is the result of the production of a bacteriocin-like substance, and these two strains with antimicrobial activity could be used as silage additives to inhibit proliferation of unwanted microorganism during ensiling and preserve nutrients of silage. the nature of the antimicrobial substances is being investigated in our laboratory.
purification and characterization of a novel plantaricin, kl-1y, from lactobacillus plantarum kl-1.
three bacteriocins from lactobacillus plantarum kl-1 were successfully purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase hplc. the bacteriocin peptides kl-1x, -1y and -1z had molecular masses of 3053.82, 3498.16 and 3533.16 da, respectively. all three peptides were stable at ph 2-12 and 25 degrees c and at high temperatures of 80 and 100 degrees c for 30 min and 121 degrees c for 15 min. however, they differed in their susceptibility to proteolytic enzymes and their inhibition spectra. kl-1y showed broad inhibitory activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis dmst 17368, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 15442, p. aeruginosa atcc 9027, escherichia coli o157:h7 and e. coli atcc 8739. kl-1x and -1z inhibited only gram-positive bacteria. kl-1x, kl-1y and kl-1z exhibited synergistic activity. the successful amino acid sequencing of kl-1y had a hydrophobicity of approximately 30 % and no cysteine residues suggested its novelty, and it was designated "plantaricin kl-1y". plantaricin kl-1y exhibited bactericidal activity against bacillus cereus jcm 2152(t). compared to nisin, kl-1y displayed broad inhibitory activities of 200, 800, 1600, 800, 400 and 400 au/ml against the growth of bacillus coagulans jcm 2257(t), b. cereus jcm 2152(t), listeria innocua atcc 33090(t), staphylococcus aureus tistr 118, e. coli o157:h7 and e. coli atcc 8739, respectively, whereas nisin had similar activities against only b. coagulans jcm 2257(t) and b. cereus jcm 2152(t). therefore, the novel plantaricin kl-1y is a promising antimicrobial substance for food safety uses in the future.
protective effects of a novel probiotic strain of lactobacillus plantarum jsa22 from traditional fermented soybean food against infection by salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.
lactobacillus species have been shown to enhance intestinal epithelial barrier function, modulate host immune responses, and suppress the growth of pathogenic bacteria, yeasts, molds, and viruses. thus, lactobacilli have been used as probiotics for treating various diseases, including intestinal disorders, and as biological preservatives in the food and agricultural industries. however, the molecular mechanisms used by lactobacilli to suppress pathogenic bacterial infections have been poorly characterized. we previously isolated lactobacillus plantarum jsa22 from buckwheat sokseongjang, a traditional korean fermented soybean food, which possessed high enzymatic, fibrinolytic, and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens. in this study, we investigated the effects of l. plantarum jsa22 on the growth of s. typhimurium and s. typhimurium-induced cytotoxicity by stimulating the host immune response in intestinal epithelial cells. the results showed that coincubation of s. typhimurium and l. plantarum jsa22 with intestinal epithelial cells suppressed s. typhimurium infection, s. typhimurium-induced nf-kappab activation, and il-8 production, and lowered the phosphorylation of both akt and p38. these data indicated that l. plantarum jsa22 has probiotic properties, and can inhibit s. typhimurium infection of intestinal epithelial cells. our findings can be used to develop therapeutic and prophylactic agents against pathogenic bacteria.
antagonistic mechanisms of synbiosis between lactobacillus plantarum cif17an2 and green banana starch in the proximal colon model challenged with salmonella typhimurium.
antagonistic mechanisms of lactobacillus plantarum cif17an2 (an infant isolate),  saba starch, and their synbiotic combination against salmonella typhimurium sa2093 were evaluated. the anti-salmonella activity was investigated under the competitive niche of fecal microbiota using the simulated proximal colon model. the alterations of the dominant fecal microbiota and beneficial bacteria were also displayed using fish and pcr-dgge techniques. l. plantarum cif17an2 exhibited anti-salmonella mechanisms through secretion of antimicrobial compounds, adhesion ability and competitive adhesion to mucin and ht-29 cell line. however, the salmonella inhibition was significantly reduced in the presence of human fecal microflora. the combination of saba starch with l. plantarum cif17an2 showed the greatest inhibition against sal. typhimurium sa2093 in the simulated colon model. the enhancement of anti-salmonella activity due to the addition of saba starch corresponded to a significant decrease in ph and an increase of lactic acid and short chain fatty acids. according to pcr-dgge analysis, l. plantarum cif17an2 was able to survive and effectively compete with fecal microflora. saba starch supplement modified bifidobacterial profile but had a slight impact on the profile of lactic acid bacteria. this prebiotic approach alleviated the nutrient limitation in the proximal colon model leading to the selective stimulation of beneficial lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, hence the enhancement of anti-salmonella activity.
lack of correlation between in vitro antibiosis and in vivo protection against enteropathogenic bacteria by probiotic lactobacilli.
increased resistance to infection is one of the beneficial effects attributed to  probiotic microorganisms. this effect may be due to several mechanisms: production of inhibitory substances, blocking of adhesion sites on the intestinal surface, competition for nutrients and stimulation of mucosal and systemic immunity. the present study aimed to investigate the correlation between in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of probiotic lactobacilli. the agar spot test was used to show that twenty lactobacillus strains were able to inhibit the enteropathogenic bacterium yersinia enterocolitica. this inhibition was mainly attributable to a decrease in ph resulting from dextrose fermentation by lactobacilli. the inhibition of y. enterocolitica, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes by two probiotic strains, lactobacillus casei c1 and lactobacillus plantarum c4, was also associated with the ph decrease. however, both strains lacked protective effects in mouse experimental infection models, with the exception of long-lasting pre-treatment with l. plantarum c4, which exerted a partial protective effect against s. typhimurium that was attributable to an immunostimulatory mechanism. our results show that in vitro antibiosis tests do not provide useful information on the probiotic potential of lactobacillus strains.
cell-free supernatants obtained from fermentation of cheese whey hydrolyzates and phenylpyruvic acid by lactobacillus plantarum as a source of antimicrobial compounds, bacteriocins, and natural aromas.
cheese whey hydrolyzates supplemented with phenylpyruvic acid (ppa) and commercial nutrients can be efficiently metabolized by lactobacillus plantarum cect-221 to biosynthesize some compounds with attractive applications in the food market. the main metabolites of cell-free extracts were antimicrobial compounds such as phenyllactic acid (pla) and lactic acid (la). the production of pla by l. plantarum cect-221 was evaluated in the man-rogosa-sharpe broth supplemented with two biosynthetic precursors: phenylalanine or ppa. using 30.5 mm ppa, the microorganism increased sevenfold the concentration of pla producing 16.4 mm pla in 46 h. a concentration of 40 mm ppa was a threshold to avoid substrate inhibition. the biosynthesis of whey hydrolyzates as a carbon source was enhanced by fed-batch fermentation of ppa; the average productivity of pla increased up to 45.4 +/- 3.02 mm after 120 h with a product yield of 0.244 mm mm(-1); meanwhile, la reached 26.1 +/- 1.3 g l(-1) with a product yield of 0.72 g g(-1). cell-free fed-batch extracts charged in wells showed bacteriocin activity with halos of 7.49 +/- 1.44 mm in plates inoculated with carnobacterium piscicola and antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus (11.54 +/- 1.14 mm), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.17 +/- 2.46 mm), listeria monocytogenes (7.75 +/- 1.31 mm), and salmonella enterica (3.60 +/- 1.52 mm). additionally, the analysis of the volatile composition of the headspace of this cell-free extract revealed that l. plantarum is a potential producer for natural aromas, such as acetophenone, with high price in the market. this is the first report of pla production from cheese whey and ppa. the extracts showed bacteriocin activity and potential to be applied as an antimicrobial in the elaboration of safer foods.
in vitro evaluation of anti-infective activity of a lactobacillus plantarum strain against salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis.
background: salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis infections are known to exhibit worldwide prevalence with increased morbidity and mortality. the conventional strategies like antibiotic therapy and vaccination have not only proved to be of sub-optimal efficacy but also led to the development of multidrug resistant strains of salmonella. antimicrobial activities of probiotics against various enteropathogens and other health promoting effects have assumed greater significance in recent years. the present study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a lactobacillus plantarum strain (ksbt 56, isolated from a traditional food product of india), in preventing salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis growth and pathogenicity in vitro. methods and results: the cell free culture supernatant (cfcs) of ksbt 56 strain notably inhibited the growth of salmonella enteritidis without affecting the growth of other gram-positive lactic acid bacteria. the isolated ksbt 56 strain produces lactic acid similar to other standard probiotic strains like lactobacillus plantarum mtcc 1407. the free radical production by ksbt 56 strain was studied by using sodc mutant of s. enteritidis, which exhibited reduced growth in the presence of cfcs of the ksbt 56 strain, indicating the inhibitory activity of free radicals on the growth of s. enteritidis. our results also showed a significant reduction in the biofilm forming ability of salmonella enteritidis in the presence of the ksbt 56 strain (2 log cfu/ml, p = 0.01). further, the anti-infective characteristics of ksbt 56 strain was validated by gentamicin protection assay which revealed 80% reduction in the invasion of salmonella enteritidis to hct-116 cell line (salmonella enteritidis and ksbt 56 in a 1:1 ratio) and delayed addition of salmonella enteritidis by 1 h. similarly, the reduced adhesion of salmonella to the hct-116 cells was observed along with the down regulation of hila gene of salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (spi1) indicating that they might have acted synergistically to decrease the invasion of the pathogen into the cell line. conclusions: ksbt 56 strain effectively inhibited the growth, invasion and the biofilm forming ability of salmonella enteritidis without inhibiting the growth of other lactobacillus strains. overall, our result suggested that ksbt 56 can be used as a potential probiotic strain with considerable beneficial effects on the host.
biotechnological production of phenyllactic acid and biosurfactants from trimming vine shoot hydrolyzates by microbial coculture fermentation.
coculture fermentations show advantages for producing food additives from agroindustrial wastes, considering that different specified microbial strains are combined to improve the consumption of mixed sugars obtained by hydrolysis. this technology dovetails with both the growing interest of consumers towards the use of natural food additives and with stricter legislations and concern in developed countries towards the management of wastes. the use of this technology allows valorization of both cellulosic and hemicellulosic fractions of trimming vine shoots for the production of lactic acid (la), phenyllactic acid (pla), and biosurfactants (bs). this work compares the study of the potential of hemicellulosic and cellulosic fractions of trimming vine shoots as cheaper and renewable carbon sources for pla and bs production by independent or coculture fermentations. the highest la and pla concentrations, 43.0 g/l and 1.58 mm, respectively, were obtained after 144 h during the fermentation of hemicellulosic sugars and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (ssf) carried out by cocultures of lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus pentosus. additionally, cell-bond bs decreased the surface tension (st) in 17.2 u; meanwhile, cell-free supernatants (cfs) showed antimicrobial activity against salmonella enterica and listeria monocytogenes with inhibition halos of 12.1+/-0.6 mm and 11.5+/-0.9 mm, respectively.
antibacterial activity and probiotic potential of lactobacillus plantarum hkn01:  a new insight into the morphological changes of antibacterial compound-treated escherichia coli by electron microscopy.
among several bacteria examined, an antibacterial-producing lactobacillus strain  with probiotic characteristics was selected and identified based on 16s rrna gene sequencing. subsequent purification and mode of action of the antibacterial compounds on target cells including e. coli were investigated. maximum production of the antibacterial compound was recorded at 18 h incubation at 30 degrees c. interestingly, antibacterial activity remained unchanged after heating at 121 degrees c for 45 min, 24 h storage in temperature range of 70 degrees c to room temperature, and 15 min exposure to uv light, and it was stable in the ph of range 2-10. the active compounds were inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, indicating their proteinaceous nature, and, therefore, referred to as bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances. isolation and partial purification of the effective agent was done by performing ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel filtration chromatography. the molecular mass of the gfc-purified active compound (~3 kda) was determined by tris-tricine sds-page. to predict the mechanisms of action, transmission electron microscopy (tem) analysis of ultrathin sections of e. coli before and after antibacterial treatment was carried out. tem analysis of antibacterial compounds-treated e. coli demonstrated that the completely altered bacteria appear much darker compared with the less altered bacteria, suggesting a change in the cytoplasmic composition. there were also some membrane-bound convoluted structures visible within the completely altered bacteria, which could be attributed to the response of the e. coli to the treatment with the antibacterial compound. according to the in vivo experiments oral administration of l. plantarum hkn01 resulted in recovery of infected balb/c mice with salmonella enterica ser. typhimurium.
factors affecting adhesion of lactic acid bacteria to caco-2 cells and inhibitory effect on infection of salmonella typhimurium.
in this study, seven strains isolated from mustard leaf kimchi were screened for  their tolerance to simulated gastric and bile juices, the adhesive properties to caco-2 cells, and the inhibition ability of salmonella typhimurium atcc 29631 adhesion. lactobacillus acidophilus gk20, lactobacillus paracasei gk74, and lactobacillus plantarum gk81, which were resistant to bile as well as gastric juices, possessed high bile-salt hydrolase (bsh) activity towards both sodium glycocholate and sodium taurocholate. the strongest in vitro adherence of 53.96 +/- 4.49% was exhibited by l. plantarum gk81 followed by l. acidophilus gk20 with adhesion levels of 40.72 +/- 9.46%. the adhesion of these strains was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced after exposure to pepsin and heating for 30 min at 80 degrees c. addition of ca2+ led to a significant (p < 0.05) increase of the adhesion of l. acidophilus gk20, but the adhesion ability of l. plantarum gk81 was not different from the control by the addition of calcium. in the competition and exclusion experiment, the adhesion inhibition of s. typhimurium by l. plantarum gk81 strain was much higher than the other strains. moreover, the exclusion inhibition of s. typhimurium by l. acidophilus gk20 was considerably high, although the inhibition activity of this strain was lower than l. plantarum gk81.
inhibitory spectra and modes of antimicrobial action of gallotannins from mango kernels (mangifera indica l.).
this study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-o-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. the mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were gram-negative bacteria. the mics of gallotannins against bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, clostridium botulinum, campylobacter jejuni, listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. the use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of s. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. supplementation of lb medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of s. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. hepta-o-galloylglucose sensitized lactobacillus plantarum tmw1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (mdr) transporter hora. carbohydrate metabolism of lactococcus lactis mg1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-o-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. in conclusion, the inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.
mode of action of plantaricin mg, a bacteriocin active against salmonella typhimurium.
plantaricin mg is a 2,180-da bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum klds1.0391, which was isolated from chinese traditional fermented cream. plantaricin mg showed a broad inhibitory activity against not only gram-positive bacteria but also gram-negative bacteria including listeria monocytogenes and salmonella typhimurium. the mode of action of plantaricin mg on s. typhimurium was reported in this article. the addition of plantaricin mg to energized cells of s. typhimurium dissipated both, the transmembrane potential (deltapsi) and the ph gradient (deltaph). energized membrane, obtained after the addition of glucose, was more susceptible to plantaricin mg action, leading to the release of intracellular k(+)ions, inorganic phosphate, atp and uv-absorbing materials. these data suggest that the presence of a proton motive force promotes the interaction of plantaricin mg with the cytoplasmic membrane of energized cells, leading to pores formation which allows the efflux of ions, thereby ensuring efficient killing of target bacteria.
detection of changes in the cellular composition of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium in the presence of antimicrobial compound(s) of lactobacillus strains using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
it was previously established that lactobacillus fermentum aca-dc 179, lactobacillus plantarum aca-dc 287 and lactobacillus plantarum aca-dc 2350 exhibit antimicrobial activity against salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. in order to further investigate the killing effect of these microorganisms against salmonella cells, we employed fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ft-ir). salmonella cells were incubated with different concentrated lactobacilli supernatants and their ft-ir spectra were recorded. the second derivative transformation of the original spectra revealed changes in spectral regions corresponding to absorptions of major cellular constituents (e.g. cell wall, cell membrane, and proteins of the cell) among the salmonella cells treated with the supernatants and those treated with the control samples. principal component analysis of the second derivative transformed spectra showed that the yet unidentified antimicrobial compound(s) produced by the lactobacilli tested clearly interfered with the fatty acids of the cell membrane, as well as the polysaccharides of the cell wall in salmonella cells, pointing towards a dual killing mode. our study shed light for the first time in the anti-salmonella activity of the particular lactobacillus strains.
inhibition of fungi and gram-negative bacteria by bacteriocin bactn635 produced by lactobacillus plantarum sp. tn635.
the aim of this study was to evaluate 54 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains isolated from meat, fermented vegetables and dairy products for their capacity to produce antimicrobial activities against several bacteria and fungi. the strain designed tn635 has been selected for advanced studies. the supernatant culture of this strain inhibits the growth of all tested pathogenic including the four gram-negative bacteria (salmonella enterica atcc43972, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 49189, hafnia sp. and serratia sp.) and the pathogenic fungus candida tropicalis r2 cip203. based on the nucleotide sequence of the 16s rrna gene of the strain tn635 (1,540 pb accession no fn252881) and the phylogenetic analysis, we propose the assignment of our new isolate bacterium as lactobacillus plantarum sp. tn635 strain. its antimicrobial compound was determined as a proteinaceous substance, stable to heat and to treatment with surfactants and organic solvents. highest antimicrobial activity was found between ph 3 and 11 with an optimum at ph = 7. the bactn635 was purified to homogeneity by a four-step protocol involving ammonium sulfate precipitation, centrifugal microconcentrators with a 10-kda membrane cutoff, gel filtration sephadex g-25, and c18 reverse-phase hplc. sds-page analysis of the purified bactn635, revealed a single band with an estimated molecular mass of approximately 4 kda. the maximum bacteriocin production (5,000 au/ml) was recorded after a 16-h incubation in man, rogosa, and sharpe (mrs) medium at 30 degrees c. the mode of action of the partial purified bactn635 was identified as bactericidal against listeria ivanovii bug 496 and as fungistatic against c. tropicalis r2 cip203.
the lactobacillus plantarum strain aca-dc287 isolated from a greek cheese demonstrates antagonistic activity in vitro and in vivo against salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.
aims: the purpose of this study was to investigate the antibacterial activity of  the xynotyri cheese isolate lactobacillus plantarum aca-dc287 using a set of in vitro and in vivo assays. methods and results: the co-culture of l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strain sl1344 results in the killing of the pathogen. the killing activity was produced mainly by non-lactic acid molecule(s) that were present in the cell-free culture supernatant of the l. plantarum strain aca-dc287. the culture of the l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 inhibited the penetration of s. typhimurium sl1344 into cultured human enterocyte-like caco-2/tc7 cells. in conventional mice infected with s. typhimurium sl1344, the intake of l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 results in a decrease in the levels of salmonella associated with intestinal tissues or those present in the intestinal contents. in germ-free mice, the l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 colonized the gastrointestinal tract. conclusions: the l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 strain exerts anti-salmonella activity similar that of the established probiotic strains lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus casei shirota yit9029 and lactobacillus johnsonii la1. significance and impact of the study: the observation that a selected cheese lactobacillus strain exerted antibacterial activity that was similar to those of probiotic lactobacillus strains, is of interest for the use of this strain as an adjunct strain for the production of health-giving cheeses.
adhesive and chemokine stimulatory properties of potentially probiotic lactobacillus strains.
five lactobacillus plantarum strains and two lactobacillus johnsonii strains, stemming either from african traditionally fermented milk products or children's feces, were investigated for probiotic properties in vitro. the relationship between the hydrophobic-hydrophilic cell surface and adhesion ability to ht29 intestinal epithelial cells was investigated, and results indicated that especially the l. johnsonii strains, which exhibited both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface characteristics, adhered well to ht29 cells. four l. plantarum and two l. johnsonii strains showed high adherence to ht29 cells, generally higher than that of the probiotic control strain lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. most strains with high adhesion ability also showed high autoaggregation ability. the two l. johnsonii strains coaggregated well with the intestinal pathogens listeria monocytogenes scott a, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 14028. the l. plantarum bfe 1685 and l. johnsonii 6128 strains furthermore inhibited the adhesion of at least two of these intestinal pathogens in coculture with ht29 cells in a strain-dependent way. these two potential probiotic strains also significantly increased interleukin-8 (il-8) chemokine production by ht29 cells, although modulation of other cytokines, such as il-1, il-6, il-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), and transforming growth factor beta (tgf-beta), did not occur. altogether, our results suggested that l. plantarum bfe 1685 and l. johnsonii bfe 6128 showed good adherence, coaggregated with pathogens, and stimulated chemokine production of intestinal epithelial cells, traits that may be considered promising for their development as probiotic strains.
selection of potential probiotic lactobacilli from pig feces to be used as additives in pelleted feeding.
thirty-five isolates from pig feces were identified as lactobacillus reuteri (12  strains), lactobacillus mucosae (7), lactobacillus plantarum (6), lactobacillus kitasatonis (3), lactobacillus rossiae (2), lactobacillus ultunensis (2), lactobacillus crispatus (2), and lactobacillus intestinalis (1) by partial sequence analysis of the 16s rrna. all isolates were detected at 8-9 log cfu g(-1). preliminarily, strains were selected based on resistance to heat treatments (ca. 70 degrees c for 10 s). the decrease in viability for some l. reuteri, l. mucosae, l. plantarum, l. kitasatonis, and l. rossiae strains was lower than 1 log cycle. selected strains were further characterized for acid and bile salt resistance, and antibacterial activity. except for l. kitasatonis, tolerance to simulated gastric and intestinal conditions was enhanced for all strains by addition of reconstituted skimmed milk. antibacterial activity was found against gram-positive and -negative potential pathogens. l. reuteri 8.1, 3s7, 6.2, and 1.2, l. mucosae 1.1r, l. plantarum 4.1, and l. rossiae 4.4 were freeze-dried and mixed (1%, w/w) into pig feed before pelleting. after pelleting, pig feed contained 10-9 log cfu kg(-1) of lactobacilli. l. plantarum 4.1, and l. reuteri 3s7 were selected based on their bile salt resistance, ph tolerance, antimicrobial activity and heat resistance. the findings in this study provide a strong basis for exploring the potential of porcine lactobacilli isolates to be used in pelleted feeding as probiotic additives.
antagonistic activity of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria against entero- and uropathogens.
aim: to develop in vitro assays for comparing the antagonistic properties and anti-oxidative activity of probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains against various entero- and urinary pathogens. methods and results: the antagonistic activity of five probiotic lactobacilli (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus fermentum me-3, lactobacillus acidophilus la5, lactobacillus plantarum 299v and lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2) and two bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium lactis bb12, bifidobacterium longum 46) against six target pathogens was estimated using different assays (solid and liquid media, anaerobic and microaerobic cultivation) and ranked (low, intermediate and high). bacterial fermentation products were determined by gas chromatography, and the total anti-oxidative activity of probiotics was measured using linolenic acid test. pyelonephritic escherichia coli was highly suppressed by gg and both bifidobacteria strains. lactobacilli strains 8700:2, 299v and me-3 were the most effective against salmonella enterica ssp. enterica in microaerobic while me-3 and both bifidobacteria expressed high activity against shigella sonnei in anaerobic milieu. lact. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. plantarum strains showed intermediate antagonistic activity against helicobacter pylori under microaerobic conditions on solid media. the highest anti-oxidative activity was characteristic for lact. fermentum me-3 (p < 0.05). no efficient antagonist against clostridium difficile was found. the positive correlations between the ph, lactic acid production and anti-microbial activity for all tested probiotics were assessed. conclusions: developed experimental assays enable to compare the anti-microbial and -oxidative activity of lactobacillus and/or bifidobacterium probiotics, which have been claimed to possess the ability of suppressing the growth of various enteric and urinary pathogens. significance and impact of the study: screening lactobacillus and bifidobacterium sp. strains according to their activity in various environmental conditions could precede the clinical efficacy studies for adjunct treatment with probiotics in cure of different gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections.
kinetic analysis of the antibacterial activity of probiotic lactobacilli towards  salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium reveals a role for lactic acid and other inhibitory compounds.
six lactobacillus strains including commercial probiotic ones (l. acidophilus ibb 801, l. amylovorus dce 471, l. casei shirota, l. johnsonii la1, l. plantarum aca-dc 287 and l. rhamnosus gg) were investigated, through batch fermentations under controlled conditions, for their capacity to inhibit salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344. all lactobacilli displayed strong antibacterial activity toward this gram-negative pathogen and significantly inhibited invasion of the pathogen into cultured human enterocyte-like caco-2/tc7 cells. by studying the production kinetics of antibacterial activity and applying the appropriate acid and ph control samples during a killing assay, we were able to distinguish between the effect of lactic acid and other inhibitory compounds produced. the antibacterial activity of l. acidophilus ibb 801, l. amylovorus dce 471, l. casei shirota and l. rhamnosus gg was solely due to the production of lactic acid. the antibacterial activity of l. johnsonii la1 and l. plantarum aca-dc 287 was due to the production of lactic acid and (an) unknown inhibitory substance(s). the latter was (were) only active in the presence of lactic acid. in addition, the lactic acid produced was responsible for significant inhibitory activity upon invasion of salmonella into caco-2/tc7 cells.
effect of elevated oxygen and carbon dioxide on the surface growth of vegetable-associated micro-organisms.
the impact of a novel type of modified atmosphere (ma), referred to as high o2-ma, on micro-organisms associated with the spoilage of minimally-processed vegetables was studied. pure cultures of pseudomonas fluorescens, enterobacter agglomerans, aureobacterium strain 27, candida guilliermondii, c. sake, salmonella typhimurium, salm. enteritidis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, leuconostoc mesenteroides var. mesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum and lactococcus lactis were cultured on an agar-surface model system and incubated at 8 degrees c under an atmosphere composed of o2 (80 or 90%, balanced with n2), co2 (10 or 20%, balanced with n2), or a combination of both gases. in general, exposure to high o2 alone did not inhibit microbial growth strongly, while co2 alone reduced growth to some extent in most cases. consistently strong inhibition was observed only when the two gases were used in combination. with minimally-processed vegetables, where co2 levels of around 20% or above cannot be used because of physiological damage to the produce, the combined treatment of high o2 and 10-20% co2 may provide adequate suppression of microbial growth, allowing a safe, prolonged shelf-life.
antibacterial activity of lactobacillus species against vibrio species.
forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.
the influence of lactobacillus plantarum culture inoculation on the fate of staphylococcus aureus and salmonella typhimurium in montasio cheese.
the growth and survival of staphylococcus aureus and salmonella typhimurium were  investigated during the manufacturing and ripening of raw milk montasio cheese. initial inoculated populations in the cheese milk were about 10(5) cfu/ml for s. aureus and 10(6) cfu/ml for s. typhimurium. samples of curds and cheeses were taken during manufacturing and storage and analysed for ph and microbial populations. s. aureus increased slightly in number during the early period of ripening and attained a population of about 10(6) cfu/ml during the remaining period of storage. s. typhimurium decreased during cheesemaking and storage but persisted through 90 days. the addition of lactobacillus plantarum culture (0.2% v/v) produced a marked reduction in populations of the test strains in 10 days of storage. enterotoxin a was not detected in montasio cheese even with a s. aureus population of 1.1 x 10(7) cfu/ml. l. plantarum strains were also tested by the spot method and the associative growth approach for their antagonistic activity against s. aureus and s. typhimurium. the compound excreted by l. plantarum was active only toward s. aureus. furthermore, its activity was destroyed by protease treatment. these results indicated that while the growth of s. typhimurium is reduced by the acid production, s. aureus inhibition can be ascribed to bacteriocin production.
properties of the ames salmonella mutants lodged in the gastrointestinal tract of gnotobiotic rats.
an association of the histidine auxotroph of salmonella typhimurium (strain ta1538) within the gastrointestinal tract of otherwise germ-free sprague-dawley rats is maintained during observations for up to 7 months. the bacteria exceed concentrations of 10(7)/g in the forestomach and exceed concentrations of 10(8)/g in the lower bowel and feces. when carcinogens are ingested, the number of revertants in the feces increases. the ingestion of structurally related compounds which are not mutagenic to the bacteria in vitro and for which no evidence of carcinogenicity exists does not increase the number of revertants in the feces. the numbers of salmonella are increased by the addition of lactobacillus plantarum and bacteroides fragilis but the salmonella disappear from the gastrointestinal tract when the rats are conventionalized. with the additional flora, there is a decrease in the number of revertants appearing in the feces in response to a given dose of carcinogen. this decrease may reflect an effect of the flora on the activity of the metabolic pathway responsible for the presence of the ultimate carcinogen or it may simply be an effect on the salmonella mutants themselves.
