TI  - Population Changes in a Community of Alkaliphilic Iron-Reducing Bacteria Due to Changes in the Electron Acceptor: Implications for Bioremediation at Alkaline Cr(VI)-Contaminated Sites.
AB  - A serial enrichment culture has been grown in an alkaline Fe(III)-citrate-containing medium from an initial inoculum from a soil layer beneath a chromium ore processing residue (COPR) disposal site where Cr(III) is accumulating from Cr(VI) containing leachate. This culture is dominated by two bacterial genera in the order Clostridiales, Tissierella, and an unnamed Clostridium XI subgroup. This paper investigates the growth characteristics of the culture when Cr(VI) is added to the growth medium and when aquifer sand is substituted for Fe(III)-citrate. The aim is to determine how the availability and chemical form of Fe(III) affects the growth of the bacterial consortium, to determine the impact of Cr(VI) on growth, and thus attempt to understand the factors that are controlling Cr(III) accumulation beneath the COPR site. The culture can grow fermentatively at pH 9.2, but growth is stronger when it is associated with Fe(III) reduction. It can withstand Cr(VI) in the medium, but growth only occurs once Cr(VI) is removed from solution. Cr(VI) reduced the abundance of Tissierella sp. in the culture, whereas the Clostridium XI sp. was Cr(VI) tolerant. In contrast, growth with solid phase Fe(III)-oxyhydroxides (present as coatings on aquifer sand) favoured the Tissierella C sp., possibly because it produces riboflavin as an extracellular electron shuttling compound allowing more efficient electron transfer to solid Fe(III) phases. Thus, it is suggested that bacterially mediated Cr(III) reduction in the soil beneath the COPR site is dependent on Fe(III) reduction to sustain the bacterial community.
TI  - Acetoanaerobium pronyense sp. nov., an anaerobic alkaliphilic bacterium isolated  from the Prony alkaline Hydrothermal Field in New Caledonia.
AB  - A novel anaerobic bacterium, strain ST07-YET, was isolated from a carbonate chimney of the Prony Hydrothermal Field (PHF) in New Caledonia. Cells were Gram-positive-staining, straight rods (0.7-0.8 x 3.0-5.0 microm). They were motile by the means of lateral flagella. Strain ST07-YET was mesophilic (optimum 35 degrees C), moderately alkaliphilic and halotolerant (optimum pH 8.7 and 5 g l-1 NaCl). Elemental sulfur, sulfate, thiosulfate, sulfite, nitrate and nitrite were not used as terminal electron acceptors. Yeast extract, peptone, tryptone, casamino-acids, crotonate, pyruvate, galactose, maltose, sucrose, ribose, trehalose and glucose were used as carbon sources. Glucose fermentation led to acetate, H2 and CO2 formation. Arginine, serine, histidine, lysine, methionine and cysteine improved growth, but the Stickland reaction was negative for the combinations of amino acids tested. The major metabolic products from yeast extract fermentation were H2, acetate, butyrate, isobutyrate, isovalerate and propionate. The predominant cellular fatty acids were C16:0, C16:1 cis9, C14:0 and C16:1 cis7 (>5% of total fatty acids). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 32.9 mol %. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that strain ST07-YET was most closely related to Clostridium sticklandii DSM 159T and Acetoanaerobium noterae NOT-3T (96.7% and 96.8% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity). On the basis of phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic and physiological properties, strain ST07-YET (= DSM 27512 = JCM 19400) is proposed as a novel species of the genus Acetoanaerobium, order Clostridiales, phylum Firmicutes, as Acetoanaerobium pronyense sp. nov..
TI  - Mageeibacillus indolicus gen. nov., sp. nov.: a novel bacterium isolated from the female genital tract.
AB  - Three isolates of a bacterium recovered from human endometrium using conventional culture methods were characterized biochemically and subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Isolates were non-motile, obligately anaerobic, non-spore forming, asaccharolytic, non-cellulolytic, indole positive, Gram positive rods. Cell wall fatty acid profiling revealed C14:0, C16:0, C18:2 omega6, 9c, C18:1 omega9c and C18:0 to be the major fatty acid composition. The DNA mol % G+C was determined to be 44.2%. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed only 91% sequence similarity with the closest cultivated bacterial isolate, Saccharofermentans acetigenes. Based on genotypic and phenotypic data, all three isolates are considered to be members of the same species and data suggest it represents a novel genus and species in the order Clostridiales with an association with Clostridium rRNA cluster III within the family Ruminococcaceae. We propose the name, Mageeibacillus indolicus gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain is BAA-2120(T) and CCUG 59143(T).
TI  - Description of Christensenella minuta gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from human faeces, which forms a distinct branch in the order Clostridiales, and proposal of Christensenellaceae fam. nov.
AB  - A novel, strictly anaerobic, non-motile, non-spore-forming, Gram-negative, short, straight rod with tapered ends, designated YIT 12065(T), was isolated from human faeces. Strain YIT 12065(T) was saccharolytic and negative for catalase, oxidase and urease, hydrolysis of aesculin and gelatin, nitrate reduction and indole production. The end products of glucose fermentation were acetic acid and a small amount of butyric acid. The DNA G+C content was 51.3 mol%. The predominant fatty acids were iso-C(15:0), C(16:0) and C(14:0). Respiratory quinones were not detected. The cell wall contained glutamic acid, serine, alanine and ll-diaminopimelic acid. The whole-cell sugars were ribose, rhamnose, galactose and glucose. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences using three treeing algorithms revealed that the strain formed a novel family-level lineage within the phylum Firmicutes, class Clostridia, order Clostridiales. Caldicoprobacter oshimai JW/HY-331(T) was shown to be the closest named relative on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity (86.9%), followed by Tindallia californiensis DSM 14871(T) (86.3%) and Clostridium ganghwense JCM 13193(T) (86.1%). Similar 16S rRNA gene sequences (98.6-96.7%) were found amongst faecal uncultured clones of human and dugong (Dugong dugon). They clustered with strain YIT 12065(T) in a distinct and deep evolutionary lineage of descent in the order Clostridiales. The distinct phylogenetic position supports the proposal of Christensenella gen. nov., with the type species Christensenella minuta sp. nov. (type strain YIT 12065(T) =DSM 22607(T) =JCM 16072(T)). A new family Christensenellaceae fam. nov. is also proposed.

The analysis of DGGE profiles, identification of dominant bands and phylogenetic analysis 16S rDNA sequences in DGGE profiles were combined to reveal the dominant bacterial communities and compared the differences between those cattle species. DGGE profiles revealed that Gayals had the most abundant dominant bacteria and the lowest similarity of intraspecies between individuals than other two cattle species. A total of 45 sequences were examined and sequence similarity analysis revealed that Gayals had the most sequences appeared to uncultured bacteria, accounting for 85.0% of the total sequences, Yaks and Yunnan Yellow Cattle had 44.4 and 68.8% uncultured bacterial sequences, respectively. According to phylogenetic analysis, the rumen dominant bacteria of Gayals were mainly phylogenetically placed within phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes, and the known bacteria were mainly belonged to the genera Lachnospiraceae bacterium, Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Clostridium celerecrescens. Moreover, the dominant bacteria of Yaks were also mainly belonged to phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes, and the known dominant bacteria were including Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, Schwartzia succinivorans and Clostridiales bacterium, most of them are common rumen bacteria. In addition, the dominant bacteria in Yunnan Yellow Cattle were belonged to phyla firmicutes, bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria, and the known dominant bacteria containing Prevotella sp., Staphylococci lentus, Staphylococcus xylosus and Corynebacterium casei. Present study first detected Staphylococcus lentus and Staphylococcus xylosus in the rumen of cattle.
TI  - Haloalkaliphilic spore-forming sulfidogens from soda lake sediments and description of Desulfitispora alkaliphila gen. nov., sp. nov.
AB  - An anaerobic enrichment with pyruvate as electron donor and thiosulfate at pH 10  and 0.6 M Na(+) inoculated with pasteurized soda lake sediments resulted in a sulfidogenic coculture of two morphotypes of obligately anaerobic haloalkaliphilic endospore-forming clostridia, which were further isolated in pure culture. Strain AHT16 was a thin long rod able to ferment sugars and pyruvate and to respire H(2), formate and pyruvate using thiosulfate and fumarate as electron acceptors and growing optimally at pH 9.5. Thiosulfate was reduced incompletely to sulfide and sulfite. The strain was closely related (99% sequence similarity) to a peptolytic alkaliphilic clostridium Natronincola peptidovorans. Strain AHT17 was a short rod with a restricted respiratory metabolism, growing with pyruvate and lactate as electron donor and sulfite, thiosulfate and elemental sulfur as electron acceptors with a pH optimum 9.5. Thiosulfate was reduced completely via sulfite to sulfide. The ability of AHT17 to use sulfite explained the stability of the original coculture of the two clostridia-one member forming sulfite from thiosulfate and another consuming it. Strain AHT17 formed an independent deep phylogenetic lineage within the Clostridiales and is proposed as a new genus and species Desulfitisporum alkaliphilum gen. nov., sp. nov. (=DSM 22410(T) = UNIQEM U794(T)).

AB  - A novel strictly anaerobic, endospore-forming, rod-shaped, Gram-positive bacterium, designated strain SGB2(T), was isolated from a mixed culture from a pond sediment during screening for sulfate-reducing bacteria capable of degrading cyanophycin (CGP). In this study, the taxonomic characterization of this mesophilic, proteolytic Clostridium isolate and the role which it, and its phylogenetic relatives, may play in peptide degradation and in the sulfur cycle are reported. Strain SGB2(T) was a commensal strain, utilizing CGP degradation products produced by other micro-organisms. Cells were motile until sporulation, forming oval, terminal spores that swell the cells. It showed optimum growth at 34 degrees C, pH 6.6 and in the absence of NaCl. Strain SGB2(T) utilized proteinaceous compounds such as peptone, Casamino acids, gelatin and trypticase soy, in addition to several amino acids and pyruvate. Utilization of many of these compounds was enhanced in the presence of thiosulfate. The isolate was unable to use any of the carbohydrates or alcohols investigated or CGP as carbon and energy sources. Thiosulfate and elemental sulfur were used as terminal electron acceptors. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that strain SGB2(T) belongs to the low-G+C-containing Clostridiales group. It exhibited 99 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to its closest relatives Clostridium thiosulfatireducens Lup21(T) and Clostridium subterminale DSM 6970(T). DNA-DNA hybridization values with these two strains were 39.4 and 42.1 %, respectively. Based on phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic characteristics, we conclude that the isolate represents a novel species of the genus Clostridium, Clostridium sulfidigenes sp. nov. The type strain is SGB2(T) (=DSM 18982(T) =ATCC BAA-1538(T)).

Carbohydrates, formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate, isovalerate, methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, butanol, lactate, succinate, starch, casein, gelatin, xylan and a number of other amino acids were not utilized. The DNA G+C content of strain ILE-2(T) was 52.7 mol%. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that ILE-2(T) was distantly related to members of the genera Aminobacterium (83 % similarity) and Aminomonas (85 % similarity) in the family Syntrophomonadaceae, order Clostridiales, phylum Firmicutes. On the basis of the results of our polyphasic analysis, strain ILE-2(T) represents a novel species and genus within the family Syntrophomonadaceae, for which the name Aminiphilus circumscriptus gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed.

The isolate produced butyric acid, propionic acid, glycerol and H(2) as fermentation end products from glucose. Strain HY-45-18(T) is halophilic as it was unable to grow in the absence of sea salts. A 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis clearly indicated that the tidal flat isolate is a member of cluster I of the order Clostridiales, which contains the type species of Clostridium, Clostridium butyricum. The closest phylogenetic neighbour of strain HY-45-18(T) was Clostridium ganghwense KCTC 5146(T) (96.5 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). Several phenotypic characteristics can be readily used to differentiate the isolate from phylogenetically related clostridia. Therefore, strain HY-45-18(T) represents a novel species of the genus Clostridium, for which the name Clostridium aestuarii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is HY-45-18(T) (=IMSNU 40129(T)=KCTC 5147(T)=JCM 13194(T)).
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a new Clostridium sp. that performs effective cellulosic waste digestion in a thermophilic methanogenic bioreactor.
AB  - A methanogenic bioreactor that utilized wastepaper was developed and operated at  55 degrees C. Microbial community structure analysis showed the presence of a group of clostridia that specifically occurred during the period of high fermentation efficiency. To isolate the effective cellulose digester, the sludge that exhibited high fermentation efficiency was inoculated into a synthetic medium that contained cellulose powder as the sole carbon source and was successively cultivated. A comprehensive 16S rRNA gene sequencing study revealed that the enriched culture contained various clostridia that had diverse phylogenetic positions. The microorganisms were further enriched by successive cultivation with filter paper as the substrate, as well as the bait carrier. A resultant isolate, strain EBR45 (= Clostridium sp. strain NBRC101661), was a new member of the order Clostridiales phylogenetically and physiologically related to Clostridium thermocellum and Clostridium straminisolvens. Specific PCR-based monitoring demonstrated that strain EBR45 specifically occurred during the high fermentation efficiency period in the original methanogenic sludge. Strain EBR45 effectively digested office paper in its pure cultivation system with a synthetic medium.
