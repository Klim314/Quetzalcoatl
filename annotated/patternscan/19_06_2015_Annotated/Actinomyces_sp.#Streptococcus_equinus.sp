TI  == central nervous system infections in filipino patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.
AB  == background and purpose: infections including those of the central nervous system  (cns) are a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in systemic lupus erythematosus (sle). this case series describes the etiology, contributing factors and outcomes of cns infections in a group of filipino patients with sle.  design: retrospective case series. methods: we reviewed the medical records of sle patients diagnosed and confined for a cns infection at the university of santo tomas hospital in manila, philippines, from 1997 to 2007. results: a total  of 23 sle patients (22 females) diagnosed with cns infection were included in this study. the mean age was 25.8 years (range 12-51) at sle diagnosis, and 30.9  years (range 14-58) at cns infection, with a mean disease duration of 55 months (range 7-125). nineteen cases (82.6%) were meningitis, and four (17.4%) were diagnoses of brain abscess. the etiologic agents were identified as cryptococcus  neoformans in seven (30.4%), mycobacterium tuberculosis in seven (30.4%), streptococcus pneumoniae in two (8.7%), salmonella sp. in one (4.4%), corynebacterium bovis with actinomyces sp. in one (4.4%), and no isolate in five  (21.7%). the average daily prednisone dose was 28.9 mg (range 0-60 mg); 10 patients had recently received pulse cyclophosphamide, and two were on mycophenolate mofetil at the time of infection. most cases had active sle; the lone patient in disease remission had s. pneumoniae meningitis post-splenectomy.  the most common presentation was headache (100%) and fever (87%). the infection resolved completely in nine patients (39.1%), and resolved with sequelae in two patients (8.7%); 12 patients (52.2%) died. conclusion: we described the etiology  and outcomes of cns infections in a group of filipino patients with sle. risk factors included active sle in the majority of cases requiring moderate- to high-dose steroids and other immunosuppressants like cyclophosphamide. although c. neoformans and m. tuberculosis were the most common etiologic agents, it is just as important to search for less common organisms which can produce disease in highly susceptible hosts. a high index of suspicion and early appropriate management are crucial to favorable outcome among these patients.

TI  == coaggregation profiles of the microflora from root surface caries lesions.
AB  == bacterial coaggregation reactions between different species and the auto aggregation of the same species are associated with the initiation and development of dental plaque and biofilms. as no such data is available on isolates from root caries lesions, we evaluated, by a visual, semi-quantitative scoring system and a spectrophotometric, quantitative assay, the coaggregation of 22 different wild-type microbial species comprising ten bacterial genera and a single candida spp. the quantitative coaggregation assay we used proved to be a more sensitive method than the semi-quantitative, visual evaluation as the results yielded the percent coaggregation. fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus bovis ii/2 and gemella morbillorum were observed having higher degrees of autoaggregation than the other examined strains. significant levels of inter-species coaggregation was seen between: (1) actinomyces spp. and veillonella spp.; (2) actinomyces israelii and peptostreptococcus prevotii; (3) campylobacter gracilis and actinomyces spp.; (4) prevotella intermedia and nine different species; and (5) fusobacterium nucleatum and six other species. the single candida albicans isolate did not coaggregate to a significant extent with any of the 21 bacterial isolates studied. scanning electron microscopy observation of the coaggregation interactions between bacterial pairs having strong coaggregation reactions revealed varying adhesive patterns. our findings on coaggregation amongst these isolates imply existence of multiple interactions between the coaggregation-inducing bacterial species in root caries. in particular, actinomyces spp., veillonella spp., prevotella spp. and fusobacterium spp. appear to play a significant role in this context.

TI  == otitis in cattle, an aetiological review.
AB  == otitis externa in cattle has a significant impact in tropical and subtropical regions, and the aetiological agents are predominantly rhabditiform nematodes and mites of the genus raillietia. its prevalence is higher in mature and zebu cattle. in advanced clinical cases there can be irreversible and fatal neural lesions. ear infection in calves has been associated with concurrent respiratory  diseases and mixed infection. the principal reported agents of otitis in calves are bacteria such as actinomyces spp., corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, escherichia coli, haemophilus somnus, pasteurella multocida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas spp., streptococcus spp. and mycoplasma bovis. the control and treatment of bovine otitis is not standardized and there is little evidence-based support for the diverse treatments available in the literature.

TI  == rapid identification of tissue micro-organisms in skin biopsy specimens from domestic animals using polyclonal bcg antibody.
AB  == immunostaining with polyclonal anti-mycobacterium bovis (bcg) was evaluated as a  single screening method for the histological identification of micro-organisms in skin biopsy specimens from various veterinary species. confirmed archival cases infected with mycobacteria, nocardia, actinobacillus, actinomyces, streptococcus/staphylococcus, dermatophilus, spirochetes, blastomyces, coccidioides, cryptococcus, histoplasma, dermatophytes, malassezia, sporothrix, leishmania, pythium, phaeohyphomycetes and prototheca organisms were selected. a  total of 70 skin biopsy specimens from the dog, cat, horse, ox and llama were evaluated. the anti-bcg immunostain labelled bacteria and fungi with high sensitivity and minimal background staining but did not label spirochetes and protozoa (leishmania). differences were not noted between veterinary species. the results indicate that immunostaining with polyclonal anti-bcg is a suitable screening technique for the rapid identification of most common bacterial and fungal organisms in paraffin-embedded specimens. also, mycobacterial and nocardial organisms were identified more readily with the anti-bcg immunostain in comparison to the histochemical stains.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 gram-positive microorganisms. the mic(90) (mg/l) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus anginosus and actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for streptococcus sanguis and listeria monocytogenes, 2 for corynebacterium jekeium and bifidobacterium bivius. over 50% of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium,  quinolone-resistant staphylococci, nocardia steroides and clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/l moxifloxacin. moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against gram-positive bacilli.

TI  == [milk chloride level as an indicator of bovine mastitis].
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine an influence of udder infection on milk chloride level and on milk productivity of cows of black and white race. bacteriological analysis was performed by bacterial isolation from milk collected in sterile conditions from single lobes of mammary gland. the study was aimed to  detect the following bacteria: streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, actinomyces pyogenes, enterobacteriaceae rods, corynebacterium bovis, and micrococcus sp. milk chloride level was determined by burette method in 1250 milk samples collected from entire udder. milk productivity was determined on the day  of bacterial isolation. statistical analysis of the results of the study on udder infection, milk chloride level, and milk productivity of mammary gland did reveal lack of a simple correlations between those parameters and in the indirect manner indicated an influence of inappropriate maintenance conditions of tested cows on  the health condition of their udder. it seems possible that alkalosis and acidosis in cows, taken into consideration in discussion section, could constitute a factor influencing the frequency of mastitis incidence.

TI  == properties of a phosphocarrier protein (hpr) extracted from intact cells of streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == cells of streptococcus sanguis strain challis were incubated with sodium lauroylsarcosinate to extract surface proteins. a polypeptide of apparent molecular mass 16 kda comprising about 12% of the extract was purified using anion-exchange chromatography. the polypeptide was shown to be a phosphocarrier protein (hpr) that could also be found in the soluble (cytoplasmic) fraction from cells broken by homogenization with glass beads. in vivo labelling of s. sanguis  cells with 32pi showed that the polypeptide carried a heat- and acid-stable phosphorylation and that during sucrose starvation the hpr became dephosphorylated. antiserum raised to the s. sanguis hpr reacted on western blots with hprs from all oral streptococci tested, together with strains of s. pyogenes and s. salivarius, but not with hprs from s. faecalis or s. bovis, nor with proteins from staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, actinomyces viscosus and  various lactobacilli. the s. sanguis hpr had a high content of alanine (17.2%) and was similar in overall amino acid composition to the hprs from s. mutans an s. salivarius. the n-terminal residues (to 37) of the s. sanguis hpr showed strong sequence identity (82%) with the n-terminal sequence of s. faecalis hpr. it is suggested that hpr in s. sanguis is associated closely with the cytoplasmic membrane. non-disruptive methods of removing cell-surface proteins from streptococci effect release of hpr and possibly other cytoplasmic components.

TI  == mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  == vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. it also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. there is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits  ribonucleic acid synthesis. induction of bacterial l-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. stable l-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to  vancomycin. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant  strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), str. pyogenes, str. agalactiae, str. bovis, str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species and lactobacillus species. there has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against staph. aureus, str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. the combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of staph. epidermidis. it shows indifference against enterococci. vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against staph. aureus.

TI  == measurement of microbial alpha-amylases with p-nitrophenyl glycosides as the substrate complex.
AB  == the detection of alpha-amylase is commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories to aid in differentiating streptococcus bovis from other streptococci. it is also useful in identifying eikenella corrodens and the gravis subspecies of corynebacterium diphtheriae and in separating species of the genera bacteroides, clostridium, actinomyces, and bacillus. currently, the most frequently used procedure utilizes starch as the substrate and iodine as the indicator. starch is incorporated into a agar medium, the isolate is inoculated on the surface, and the medium is incubated for 24 to 48 h. a 15-min test containing p-nitrophenyl polyglycosides as the substrate complex was developed to yield results comparable with the agar-based starch test. the reagent was made in liquid form, 0.20 ml per tube, and could be incubated either in ambient air or at 35 degrees c. when dried, the p-nitrophenyl polyglycoside reagent could be stored at 0 degrees c for 4 weeks.

TI  == circulating antibodies after experimental chronic infection in the root canal of  teeth in monkeys.
AB  == root canals of 49 teeth with necrotic pulp tissue in five monkeys were infected with streptococcus faecalis ss liquefaciens, actinomyces bovis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and bacteroides oralis in various combinations. after 6 months the root canals and the periapical tissues were subjected to radiographic, bacteriologic, and histologic examinations. signs of periapical inflammation were radiographically registered in 41 teeth, most frequently in teeth inoculated with a mixed flora. in 11 out of 16 teeth infected separately with strep. faecalis ss liquefaciens, apical periodontitis was observed. sera from the monkeys prior to and after the experimental inoculation were analyzed by means of gel diffusion, hemagglutination (ha), and complement binding test for antibodies against different antigen preparations of the homologous bacterial strains used for the inoculation. detectable antibodies were seen with antigens of b. oralis in all five monkeys. agglutinating antibodies were demonstrated with lipopolysaccharide-antigen of b. oralis in titers between  1:40 and 1:320. a marked reduction of the antibody level against lipopolysaccharide (lps) antigen after mercaptoethanol treatment indicated that a main part of the antibodies registered was of igm-class. the study shows that certain antigens of bacterial origin from infected root canals, while affecting the periapical tissues, also stimulate the production of circulating antibodies.

TI  == apical periodontitis induced by selected bacterial strains in root canals of immunized and nonimmunized monkeys.
AB  == experimental infections in root canals with streptococcus faecalis ss. liquefaciens (strep-mc4). actinomyces bovis (act-mc6) and bacteroides oralis (bact-mc3) were studied in four immunized and five nonimmunized monkeys. the immunization was performed using antigens of the homologous strains. the antibody level was checked by gel diffusion. in 56 root canals of the immunized animals and 60 root canals of the nonimmunized animals, viable cells of the three bacterial strains were enclosed in equal amounts of various combinations. after 6 months, samples from the root canals were subjected to qualitative and quantitative bacteriologic analyses and the apical area was radiographically and  histologically examined. the analyses revealed no significant difference between  the two groups of monkeys, although the viable cell recovery was slightly higher  in most of the root canals of nonimmunized monkeys. the cell proportion of the strains within the different bacterial combinations was equal in root canals of the two groups of animals. the radiographic and histologic examinations revealed  no significant difference between the two groups of animals regarding the number  of teeth with periapical lesions. the radiographic examination, however, showed a more distinct limitation of the process in the immunized than in the nonimmunized monkeys. histologically the lesions were more encapsulated and had a sparser cell infiltration in immunized than in nonimmunized monkeys. in the latter, inflammatory cells had often infiltrated the bone. mixed infections gave a more severe periapical reaction than single strain infections in both animal groups.

TI  == the antibacterial action of vancomycin.
AB  == vancomycin inhibits the second stage of cell wall synthesis in susceptible bacteria. furthermore, there is evidence that vancomycin also alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits ribonucleic acid synthesis. stable l-phase variants are susceptible to vancomycin, but induction of bacterial l-phase variants with vancomycin is very difficult. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive cocci and bacilli, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (including multiply resistant strains). streptococcus  pneumoniae (including multiply resistant strains), streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus bovis, viridans group streptococcus, enterococcus, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species, and lactobacillus species. antimicrobial activity can be enhanced with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against s. aureus, s. bovis, enterococcus, and viridans streptococcus. the combination of vancomycin and rifampin also has enhanced activity against s. aureus.

TI  == further characteristics of beta2-microglobulin binding to oral streptococci.
AB  == a total of 85 strains of oral bacteria representing streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. mitior, s. salivarious, s. milleri, s. infrequens, s. durans, s. lactis, s. faecalis, s. faecium, s. equinus, streptococcus species group e, actinomyces, and one group a streptococcus were tested for binding of aggregated  human beta 2-microglobulin. positive affinity between bacteria and aggregated human beta 2-microglobulin was detected in 36% of the strains. no apparent correlation with bacterial species, serotype, or group was noted. no positive strains were detected among seven group i:a s. sanguis strains (p < 0.01). binding constants for one s. mutans strain indicated heterogeneous binding structures on the bacterial surface. the number of binding sites for aggregates of human beta 2-microglobulin involving multipoint attachment varied from 70 to 1,700 per bacterial cell. with whole saliva as buffer, a general increase in affinity was seen. variations in salt concentrations of the buffers revealed different salt-dependent species-associated uptake patterns. oral bacteria tended to have an uptake maximum at a salt concentration similar to that seen in saliva. binding structures for aggregated beta 2-microglobulin on oral streptococci were  sensitive to pepsin, heat, and formaldehyde treatment. bacterial binding structures for aggregated beta 2-microglobulin might represent one of several factors of importance for bacterial attachment in the oral cavity. experimental conditions reflecting the salivary milieu increased the degree of interaction, emphasizing the importance of physiological test systems for such studies.

TI  == binding of lectins to streptococcus mutans cells and type-specific polysaccharides, and effect on adherence.
AB  == the lectin concanavalin a (con a) agglutinated the cells of 13 of 15 strains of the seven serotypes of streptococcus mutans in an 18-h incubation period. strains of types a, d, f, and g agglutinated within 2 h. strains of a, d, and f were also agglutinated in 2 h by the castor bean lectin rca. s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s.  bovis, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, and lactobacillus plantarum were agglutinated within 2 h. the s. mutans type f polysaccharide was precipitated by  con a. the a, b, c, d, and e polysaccharides were not precipitated. glucan from d and e strains of s. mutans and dextran t2000 were also precipitated by con a. d-glucose inhibited the agglutination of type f cells by con a and the agglutination of type d cells by d-galactose. the quantity of [acetyl-3h]con a bound was not proportional to the degree of agglutination. cells grown in sucrose medium bound more con a than those grown in glucose medium. after treatment with  dextranase, the sucrose-grown cells bound two- to fourfold more con a. the binding of con a to the type-specific polysaccharide or to teichoic acid could not be determined by the use of specific antibody due to the binding of con a to  the antibody globulin on the cell surface. con a bound to s. mutans cells did not inhibit the activity of cell-bound glucosyltransferase, glucan synthesis, and in  vitro adherence. bound con a also did not inhibit the ability of heat-treated cells to bind glucosyltransferase, synthesize glucan, and produce in vitro adherence.
