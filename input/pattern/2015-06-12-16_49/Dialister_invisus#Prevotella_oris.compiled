TI  - Exploring bacterial diversity of endodontic microbiota by cloning and sequencing  16S rRNA.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The characterization of microbial communities infecting the endodontic system in each clinical condition may help on the establishment of a correct prognosis and distinct strategies of treatment. The purpose of this study was to determine the bacterial diversity in primary endodontic infections by 16S ribosomal-RNA (rRNA) sequence analysis. METHODS: Samples from root canals of untreated asymptomatic teeth (n = 12) exhibiting periapical lesions were obtained, 16S rRNA bacterial genomic libraries were constructed and sequenced, and bacterial diversity was estimated. RESULTS: A total of 489 clones were analyzed (mean, 40.7 +/- 8.0 clones per sample). Seventy phylotypes were identified of which six were novel phylotypes belonging to the family Ruminococcaceae. The mean number of taxa per canal was 10.0, ranging from 3 to 21 per sample; 65.7% of the cloned sequences represented phylotypes for which no cultivated isolates have been reported. The most prevalent taxa were Atopobium rimae (50.0%), Dialister invisus, Prevotella oris, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and Tannerella forsythia (33.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Although several key species predominate in endodontic samples of asymptomatic cases with periapical lesions, the primary endodontic infection is characterized by a wide bacterial diversity, which is mostly represented by members of the phylum Firmicutes belonging to the class Clostridia followed by the phylum Bacteroidetes.
