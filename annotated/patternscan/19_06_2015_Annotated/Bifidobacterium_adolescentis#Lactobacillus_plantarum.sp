TI  == folate production by probiotic bacteria.
AB  == probiotic bacteria, mostly belonging to the genera lactobacillus and bifidobacterium, confer a number of health benefits to the host, including vitamin production. with the aim to produce folate-enriched fermented products and/or develop probiotic supplements that accomplish folate biosynthesis in vivo  within the colon, bifidobacteria and lactobacilli have been extensively studied for their capability to produce this vitamin. on the basis of physiological studies and genome analysis, wild-type lactobacilli cannot synthesize folate, generally require it for growth, and provide a negative contribution to folate levels in fermented dairy products. lactobacillus plantarum constitutes an exception among lactobacilli, since it is capable of folate production in presence of para-aminobenzoic acid (paba) and deserves to be used in animal trials to validate its ability to produce the vitamin in vivo. on the other hand, several folate-producing strains have been selected within the genus bifidobacterium, with a great variability in the extent of vitamin released in the medium. most of them belong to the species b. adolescentis and b. pseudocatenulatum, but few folate producing strains are found in the other species as well. rats fed a probiotic formulation of folate-producing bifidobacteria exhibited increased plasma folate level, confirming that the vitamin is produced in vivo and absorbed. in a human trial, the same supplement raised folate concentration in feces. the use of folate-producing probiotic strains can be regarded as a new perspective in the specific use of probiotics. they could more efficiently confer protection against inflammation and cancer, both exerting the beneficial effects of probiotics and preventing the folate deficiency that is associated with premalignant changes in the colonic epithelia.

TI  == the role of components of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus in pathogenesis and serologic diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid diseases.
AB  == during recent years, researchers have been focusing on the concept of an infectious etiology of autoimmune diseases. the most discussed theory is molecular mimicry, i.e. the emergence of autoreactive clones of t- and b-lymphocytes as a result of cross-immune response to homologous bacterial or viral antigen. information on the role of probiotic microorganisms (pm) in the molecular mechanisms of autoimmune thyroid diseases (atd) is limited. using proteins and immunogenic peptides databanks and relevant computer programs, the homology between the amino acid sequences of thyroid peroxidase (tpo) and thyroglobulin (tg), which are potential b- and t-cell epitopes of these antigens, and proteins of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli was established. moreover, we have found components of cells of bifidobacterium bifidum 791, bifidobacterium adolescentis 94 bim, bifidobacterium longum b379m and lactobacillus plantarum b-01 that selectively bind human antibodies to tpo (anti-tpo) and antibodies to tg (anti-tg) and compete with natural antigens for the binding of anti-tpo and anti-tg in elisa. additionally, a three-fold difference was observed between the  probability of detecting antibodies (abs) to the antigens of l. plantarum b-01 and b. bifidum 791 in serum samples containing and those not containing anti-tpo. on the whole, our data are arguments in favour of the assumption of the possible  role of pm of the genera bifidobacterium and lactobacillus in triggering atd by the mechanism of molecular mimicry. the data obtained in silico and in vitro should be proven by use of animal models and clinical studies for extrapolations  to the whole body. possible antigenic properties of components/proteins of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, selectively binding anti-tpo and anti-tg should  be taken into consideration. natural human abs to these bacterial components are  probably able to cross-react with the tpo and tg in the elisa for detection of anti-tpo and anti-tg, which are serologic markers of atd. it can lead to unspecific false positive results and, hence, to an incorrect diagnosis.

TI  == molecular characterization of native isolates of lactic acid bacteria, bifidobacteria and yeasts for beneficial attributes.
AB  == in a changing scenario of food habits being associated with wellness factors through the concepts of probiotics and prebiotics, an attempt has been made to characterize on molecular basis, the desirable benefits associated with natural isolates of lactic acid bacteria, bifidobacteria, and yeasts. from a diverse range of foods and related samples, based on conventional microbiological protocols, three well-characterized natural isolates of lactobacillus plantarum mtcc 5422, bifidobacterium adolescentis mtcc 5423 and saccharomyces cerevisiae mtcc 5421 were selected. the cultures of l. plantarum and b. adolescentis showed  positive polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification with oligonucleotide primers targeting genus-specific 16 s rrna for lactobacillus and fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase for bifidobacterium. similarly, species-specific positive amplification in pcr was observed with primers of phytase (acid phosphatase) in s. cerevisiae and alpha-d: -galactosidase and bile  salt hydrolase in l. plantarum and b. adolescentis. the cultures of l. plantarum  and b. adolescentis exhibited a broad spectrum antibacterial activity against selected foodborne pathogenic bacterial species and tolerance to acid and bile. gene sequence of respective pcr-amplified products confirmed the genetic identity of the isolated cultures as l. plantarum and b. adolescentis showing 99% homology with the documented sequence of established gene bank.

TI  == [analysis of the probiotic bifidobacterium and lactobacillus community in child intestinal flora].
AB  == to investigate the distribution of child intestinal flora and the composition of  its key probiotics community, study on intestinal flora of 21 chinese children (age 2 - 5) was conducted, which included bacteria isolation and counting, 16s rdna sequencing and homology analysis. for identification of the key probiotics such as bifidobacterium and lactobacillus in children feces at the species level, the specific primers im26/im3 and l159/l677 for pcr amplification of partial 16s  rdna were used. the results show that the composition of child intestinal flora is was relatively stable and almost same to the intestinal flora of the youth (age 20 - 25). culture-based approaches show that the key probiotic community in  feces at the species level was highly different in composition and numbers from individual to individual. b. longum and b. pseudocatenulatum, which are detected  at levels of 10(7) cfu/g (wet) in samples and the detection rates are 90.48% and  85.71% respectively, are believed to be major bifidobacterial species in child intestinal microbiota. in addition, b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. infantis and  b. thermacidophium have also been found. l. mucosae, l. fermentum, l. salivarius, l. ruminis, l. gasseri and l. plantarum are isolated from the stools. l. mucosae  (3.68 log10 cfu/g (wet), detection rate 71.43%) and l. fermentum (3.97 log10 cfu/g (wet), detection rate 52.38%) are two dominant species of lactobacillus. study on chinese child intestinal flora, especially on the compositions and numbers of key probiotics in the feces will be very helpful to the development of effective probiotics in future.

TI  == [growth and morphological characteristics of industrial strains of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus cultivated in hydrolysate-milk and hydrolysate-soybean media].
AB  == growth features of industrial strains of bifidobacterium adolescentis mc-42, b. bifidum 1, b. longum b-379, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 8-79 and l. plantarum 8pa3 cultivated in hydrolysate-milk or hydrolysate-soybean media (hmm and hsm respectively) were analysed comparatively. the bacterial cells were investigated morphometrically with atom strength microscopy. it was shown that hsm vs hmm provided a higher growth rate of the strains (shortened growth phases and higher growth rates) that was more evident for the bifidobacteria as compared to the lactobacilli. at the same time, the morphological features of the bacterial cells slightly depended on the medium composition and were mainly defined by the genus.

TI  == commensal gram-negative bacteria prime human dendritic cells for enhanced il-23 and il-27 expression and enhanced th1 development.
AB  == dendritic cells (dc) are the main orchestrators of specific immune responses. depending on microbial information they encounter in peripheral tissues, they promote the development of th1, th2 or unpolarized th cell responses. in this study we have investigated the immunomodulatory effect of non-pathogenic intestinal gram-negative (escherichia coli, bacteroides vulgatus,veillonella parvula, pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram-positive (bifidobacterium adolescentis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus plantarum and staphylococcus aureus) bacteria on human monocyte-derived dc (modc). none of the gram-positive bacteria  (gpb) primed for th1 or th2 development. in contrast, despite the low levels of il-12 they induce, all gram-negative bacteria (gnb) primed modc for enhanced th1  cell development, which was dependent on il-12 and an additional unidentified cofactor. strikingly, gnb-matured modc expressed elevated levels of p19 and p28 mrna, the critical subunits of il-23 and il-27, respectively, suggesting that the il-12 family members may jointly be responsible for their th1-driving capacity. purified major cell wall components of either gnb or gpb did not yield th cell profiles identical to those obtained with whole bacteria, and could not explain the induction of the il-12 family members nor th1 priming by gnb. importantly, this study gives indications that the expression of the different il-12 family members is dictated by different priming conditions of immature dc.

TI  == pattern of cytokine responses to gram-positive and gram-negative commensal bacteria is profoundly changed when monocytes differentiate into dendritic cells.
AB  == the normal gastrointestinal bacterial flora is crucial for the maturation of acquired immunity via effects on antigen-presenting cells (apcs). here we investigated how two types of apcs, monocytes and dendritic cells (dcs), react to different bacterial strains typical of the commensal intestinal microflora. purified human monocytes and monocyte-derived dcs were stimulated with uv-inactivated gram-positive (lactobacillus plantarum and bifidobacterium adolescentis) and gram-negative (escherichia coli and veillonella parvula) bacterial strains. monocytes produced higher levels of interleukin 12p70 (il-12p70) and tumor necrosis factor (tnf), as detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, in response to l. plantarum than in response to e. coli and  v. parvula. in contrast, dcs secreted large amounts of il-12p70, tnf, il-6, and il-10 in response to e. coli and v. parvula but were practically unresponsive to  l. plantarum and b. adolescentis. the lack of a response to the gram-positive strains correlated with lower surface expression of toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) on dcs than on monocytes. the surface expression of tlr4 on dcs was undetectable  when it was analyzed by flow cytometry, but blocking this receptor decreased the  tnf production in response to v. parvula, indicating that tlr4 is expressed at a  low density on dcs. gamma interferon increased the expression of tlr4 on dcs and  also potentiated the cytokine response to the gram-negative strains. our results  indicate that when monocytes differentiate into dcs, their ability to respond to  different commensal bacteria dramatically changes, and they become unresponsive to probiotic gram-positive bacteria. these results may have important implications for the abilities of different groups of commensal bacteria to regulate mucosal and systemic immunity.

TI  == innate immune responses of human neonatal cells to bacteria from the normal gastrointestinal flora.
AB  == the hygiene hypothesis postulates that the prevalence of allergy has increased due to decreased microbial stimulation early in life, leading to delayed maturation of the immune system. the aim of this study was to examine the cytokine pattern produced from cord blood mononuclear cells relative to adult cells after stimulation with bacterial strains from the normal flora. mononuclear cells from cord and adult blood samples were stimulated with the following bacteria: bifidobacterium adolescentis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus mitis, corynebacterium minutissimum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides vulgatus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, veillonella parvula, and neisseria sicca. the levels of interleukin 12 (il-12), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-10, and il-6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the tnf-alpha production was also analyzed after blocking cd14, toll-like receptor 2 (tlr-2), and tlr-4 prior to stimulation with bacteria. the levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha were similar in cord and adult cells. gram-positive bacteria induced considerably higher levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha than gram-negative bacteria in both cord and adult cells. the levels of il-6 were significantly higher in newborns than in adults, whereas the levels of  il-10 were similar in newborns and adults. gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria induced similar levels of il-6 and il-10 in cord cells. l. plantarum bound or signaled through cd14, tlr-2, and tlr-4, whereas e. coli acted mainly through cd14 and tlr-4. these results indicate that the innate immune response in newborns to commensal bacteria is strong and also suggest that different bacterial strains may have differential effects on the maturation of the immune system of infants.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == analysis of intestinal flora of a patient with congenital absence of the portal vein.
AB  == a 14-year-old female patient, admitted for a closer examination of liver tumour (hepatocellular adenoma), was diagnosed as having a congenital absence of the portal vein. the blood ammonia level (approximately 120 micrograms dl-1) in the superior mesenteric vein was markedly low compared to the normal value of 300-350 micrograms dl-1 in the portal vein. the decreased ammonia concentration and urease activity of the patient's faeces were demonstrated. the dominant intestinal flora in the faeces of the patient, before operation, was bifidobacterium sp., bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium lonqum, lactobacillus plantarum, and after the operation bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, peptococcus magnus bifidobacterium longum. in contrast, bifidobacterium bifidum,  bacteroides ureolyticus, bacteroides ovatus and bacteroides distasonis, b. ovatus, bifidobacterium adolescentis were dominant flora in the faeces of two healthy volunteers, respectively. among microorganisms isolated from the patient, morganella morganii, candida sp., eubacterium aerofacience and eubacterium rectale were strongly positive in urease activity in vitro; streptococcus mitior, staphylococcus intermedius, micrococcus kristinae, selenomonas ruminantum, bacteroides ureolyticus and lactobacillus casei ss. pseudoplantarum from the healthy volunteers. these results imply the homeostatic regulation system of faecal ammonia concentration by urease-producing microorganisms in the patient.

TI  == [the range of antigenic specificity of bifidobacterium peptidoglycan].
AB  == the antigenic relationships of bifidobacterium bifidum 1 peptidoglycans with different strains of this species (lva-3, 791, go-4), bifidobacteria of other species (b. adolescentis go-13, b. breve 79-38, b. lactentis 79-41, b. longum go-3) and bacteria of remote taxonomic groups (streptococcus faecalis 6-3. staphylococcus aureus com 885, s. epidermidis com 2124. lactobacillus plantarum 1, escherichia coli m-17) were studied on the basis of a highly sensitive test system permitting the registration of normal human antibodies to peptidoglycans.  the level of cross reactions with staphylococci and streptococci correspond to intraspecific and antigenic affinity to l. plantarum and e. coli was considerably less pronounced. copying a number of epitopes of bifidobacteria, s. aureus peptidoglycan seems to possess additional antigenic determinants which participate in the formation of immunological responsiveness in man.

TI  == [changes within lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species].
AB  == laboratory rats with a gut flora unambiguous free from bifidobacterium revealed three days after an application of a lactose-rich food a dominating lactobacillus plantarum flora. up from this date, bifidobacterium could be detected for the first time. at the beginning, there was to be observed merely b. adolescentis and b. pseudolongum, at the 5th to the 10th day b. bifidum supervened. finally this species together with b. infantis was dominating. with in vitro experiments, by a systematic modifying of the medium changes from bifidobacterium species typical to faeces from infants to such species only to meet in faeces from adults could be observed only after a long time of cultivation.
