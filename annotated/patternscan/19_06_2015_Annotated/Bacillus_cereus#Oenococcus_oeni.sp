TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == isolation, purification and partial characterization of plantaricin 423, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == lactobacillus plantarum 423, isolated from sorghum beer, produces a bacteriocin (plantaricin 423) which is inhibitory to several food spoilage bacteria and food-borne pathogens, including bacillus cereus, clostridium sporogenes, enterococcus faecalis, listeria spp. and staphylococcus spp. plantaricin 423 is resistant to treatment at 80 degrees c, but loses 50% of its activity after 60 min at 100 degrees c and 75% of its activity after autoclaving (121 degrees c, 15 min). plantaricin 423 remains active after incubation at ph 1-10 and is inactivated when treated with pepsin, papain, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and proteinase k. plantaricin 423 was partially purified and its size estimated at 3.5 kda, as determined by tricine-sds-page. the mechanism of activity of plantaricin 423 is weakly bactericidal, as determined against oenococcus oeni (previously leuconostoc oenos). high dna homology was obtained between the plasmid dna of strain 423 and the pediocin pa-1 operon of pediococcus acidilactici pac 1.0, suggesting that plantaricin 423 is plasmid-encoded and related to the pediocin gene cluster.
