TI  == conjunctival flora of clinically normal and diseased turtles and tortoises.
AB  == background: in captive breed turtles and tortoises conjunctival disease is common. our aim was to investigate the bacterial and fungal flora present in the  eyes of healthy and pathological chelonians and to compare findings in turtles with those in tortoises. results: samples were taken from the conjunctival sacs of 34, diseased and healthy, chelonians (18 tortoises and 16 turtles) and submitted to bacterial and fungal investigation. all samples showed bacterial growth. thirteen animals (38%), harboured a single bacterial species as sole isolate and twenty-one animals (62%) harboured more than one species. detection of multiple bacterial infection was clearly greater in tortoises compared to turtles. most frequently isolated bacterial species were bacillus spp. (13 isolates), staphylococcus xylosus (10 isolates), sphingomonas paucimobilis (6 isolates), staphylococcus sciuri and aeromonas hydrophila/caviae (each 5 isolates), ochrobactrum anthropi (3 isolates), citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas luteola (each 2 isolates). only one isolate of kocuria varians/rosea, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus auricularis, staphylococcus  haemolyticus, staphylococcus lentus, morganella morganii, pasteurella multocida,  pasteurella pneumotropica/haemolytica, proteus spp., pseudomonas putida, salmonella enterica ssp. arizonae, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and vibrio parahaemolyticus was evidenced. the presence in 8 animals of mycoplasma spp. and  in 1 animal with severe conjunctivitis of chlamydia spp. was detected by pcr. candida spp. was also isolated from two healthy animals. conclusions: a clear predominance of gram positive isolates in tortoises and gram negative isolates in turtles was found. however, we cannot ascribe the observed difference to the diversity of animal species, as other factors, including especially different characteristics of the living environments, may play a role. almost all bacterial species isolated may have clinical significance, mostly as opportunistic pathogens, both for humans and animals. that chelonians are often carrier of bacteria with zoonotic potential is a well-known fact, in particular with regard  to salmonella spp. therefore, it is not surprising the detection of a strain of salmonella enterica ssp. arizonae in the eye of one of the animals tested. worthy of note is the finding of chlamydia spp. in a severe case of conjunctivitis, though we cannot epidemiologically assess a cause-effect relationship between presence of chlamydia and disease.

TI  == in vitro evidence of chain transfer to tetraethylene glycols in enzymatic polymerization of polyhydroxyalkanoate.
AB  == a polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha) was enzymatically synthesized in vitro, and the end  structure of pha associated with a chain transfer (ct) reaction was investigated. in the ct reaction, pha chain transfers from pha synthase (phac) to a ct agent, resulting in covalent bonding of ct agent to the pha chain at its carboxyl end. in vitro ct reaction has never been demonstrated because of relatively low yields of in vitro synthesized poly[(r)-3-hydroxybutyrate)] (p(3hb)), which makes it difficult to characterize the end structures of the polymers by nuclear magnetic  resonance (nmr). to overcome these difficulties, a novel in vitro synthesis method that produced relatively larger amounts of p(3hb) was developed by employing phacda from delftia acidovorans and two enantioselective enoyl-coenzyme a (coa) hydratases which were r-hydratase (phajac) from aeromonas caviae and s-hydratase (fadb1x) from pseudomonas putida kt2440 with beta-butyrolactone and coa as starting materials. using this method, p(3hb) synthesis was performed with tetraethylene glycols (tegs) as a discriminable ct agent, and the resultant p(3hb) was characterized by (1)h-nmr. nmr analysis revealed that the carboxylic end of p(3hb) was covalently linked to tegs, providing the first direct evidence  of in vitro ct reaction.

TI  == the occurrence of aeromonas in drinking water, tap water and the porsuk river.
AB  == the occurrence of aeromonas spp. in the porsuk river, public drinking water and tap water in the city of eskisehir (turkey) was monitored. fresh water samples were collected from several sampling sites during a period of one year. total 102 typical colonies of aeromonas spp. were submitted to biochemical tests for species differentiation and of 60 isolates were confirmed by biochemical tests. further identifications of isolates were carried out first with the vitek system  (biome rieux) and then selected isolates from different phenotypes (vitek types)  were identified using the dupont qualicon riboprinter(r) system. aeromonas spp. was detected only in the samples from the porsuk river. according to the results  obtained with the vitek system, our isolates were 13% aeromonas hydrophila, 37% aeromonas caviae, 35% pseudomonas putida, and 15% pseudomonas acidovorans. in addition pseudomonas sp., pseudomonas maltophila, aeromonas salmonicida, aeromonas hydrophila, and aeromonas media species were determined using the riboprinter(r) system. the samples taken from the porsuk river were found to contain very diverse aeromonas populations that can pose a risk for the residents of the city. on the other hand, drinking water and tap water of the city are free from aeromonas pathogens and seem to be reliable water sources for the community.

TI  == microbial production of polyhydroxyalkanoate block copolymer by recombinant pseudomonas putida.
AB  == polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha) synthesis genes phapcj(ac) cloned from aeromonas caviae were transformed into pseudomonas putida ktoy06deltac, a mutant of p. putida kt2442, resulting in the ability of the recombinant p. putida ktoy06deltac (phapcj(a.c)) to produce a short-chain-length and medium-chain-length pha block copolymer consisting of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (phb) as one block and random copolymer of 3-hydroxyvalerate (3hv) and 3-hydroxyheptanoate (3hhp) as another block. the novel block polymer was studied by differential scanning calorimetry (dsc), nuclear magnetic resonance, and rheology measurements. dsc studies showed  the polymer to possess two glass transition temperatures (t(g)), one melting temperature (t(m)) and one cool crystallization temperature (t(c)). rheology studies clearly indicated a polymer chain re-arrangement in the copolymer; these  studies confirmed the polymer to be a block copolymer, with over 70 mol% homopolymer (phb) of 3-hydroxybutyrate (3hb) as one block and around 30 mol% random copolymers of 3hv and 3hhp as the second block. the block copolymer was shown to have the highest tensile strength and young's modulus compared with a random copolymer with similar ratio and a blend of homopolymers phb and phvhhp with similar ratio. compared with other commercially available pha including phb, phbv, phbhhx, and p3hb4hb, the short-chain- and medium-chain-length block copolymer phb-b-phvhhp showed differences in terms of mechanical properties and should draw more attentions from the pha research community.

TI  == production of p(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate-co-3-hydroxyoctanoate) terpolymers using a chimeric pha synthase in recombinant ralstonia eutropha and pseudomonas putida.
AB  == recombinant strains of ralstonia eutropha and pseudomonas putida harboring a chimeric polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha) synthase, which consisted of pha synthases of aeromonas caviae and r. eutropha, produced 3-hydroxybutyrate (3hb)-based pha copolymers comprised of 3-hydroxyhexanoate and 3-hydroxyoctanoate units from dodecanoate (87-97 mol % 3hb), indicating that the chimeric pha synthase possesses desirable substrate specificity leading to the production of 3hb-rich copolymers.

TI  == occurrence and diversity of integrons and beta-lactamase genes among ampicillin-resistant isolates from estuarine waters.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence and molecular diversity of beta-lactamase genes and integrons among gram-negative ampicillin-resistant bacteria from ria de aveiro. ampicillin-resistant isolates were selected and subjected to genotyping using rep-pcr. representatives from each rep pattern were affiliated with the following taxa by sequencing the 16s rrna gene: aeromonas caviae, a. hydrophila, a. media, a. molluscorum, a. veronii, a. salmonicida, aeromonas sp., pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas sp., escherichia coli, escherichia sp., shigella sonnei, shigella sp., klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, r. planticola, citrobacter freundii, morganella morganii and enterobacter sp. isolates affiliated with genera escherichia or shigella were identified as escherichia coli using phenotypic-based tests. pcr was used to assess beta-lactamase encoding sequences (bla(tem), bla(shv), bla(carb), bla(ctx-m), bla(imp), bla(vim), bla(cpha/imis), bla(oxa-a), bla(oxa-b), bla(oxa-c)), class 1 and class 2 integrases, and integron variable regions. sequence analysis of pcr products was performed. beta-lactamase genes were detected in 77.8% of the enterobacteriaceae and in 10.5% of the aeromonas. the most frequently detected gene was bla(tem), followed by bla(shv,)bla(oxa-b),  bla(cpha/imis) and bla(carb). retrieved sequences shared high homology with previously described beta-lactamases. the inti1 gene was present in 29.6% of the  enterobacteriaceae and in 21% of the aeromonas isolates. the inti2 gene was present in 4 isolates. a total of 13 cassettes included in 12 different cassette  arrays were identified. the most frequently found resistance gene cassettes were  aada variants. previous investigations based on cultivation-independent approaches revealed higher molecular diversity among beta-lactamase-encoding sequences in this estuary. this fact reinforces the hypothesis that cultivation-dependent approaches may underestimate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in environmental samples and may introduce bias in the recovery  of their molecular variants.

TI  == characterization of 13 kda granule-associated protein in aeromonas caviae and biosynthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates with altered molar composition by recombinant bacteria.
AB  == analysis of native poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) [p(3hb-co-3hhx)] inclusions from aeromonas caviae fa440 revealed that orf1 (a 348-bp gene located  immediately upstream of phac(ac)) encodes a 13-kda granule-associated protein, which was referred to as phap(ac). several recombinant strains of a. caviae were  constructed and conducted to analyze their pha-producing abilities. a transconjugant of fa440 harboring additional copies of phapcj(ac) genes accumulated p(3hb-co-3hhx) copolyesters with much higher 3hhx composition (46-63  mol %) than wild-type strain from alkanoates or olive oil. deletion analysis revealed that overexpression of phaj(ac) encoding monomer-supplying (r)-hydratase was not a reason for the compositional change in the recombinant strains. pha synthase activity in pha inclusion fraction from the transconjugant composed of 60 mol % of 3hhx was 10-fold higher than that from the strain fa440 with 13 mol % of 3hhx, suggesting an importance of the level of pha synthase activity for controlling the pha composition in vivo.

TI  == cloning and analysis of the poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) biosynthesis genes of aeromonas caviae.
AB  == a 5.0-kbp ecorv-ecori restriction fragment was cloned and analyzed from genomic dna of aeromonas caviae, a bacterium producing a copolyester of (r)-3-hydroxybutyrate (3hb) and (r)-3-hydroxyhexanoate (3hhx) [p(3hb-co-3hhx)] from alkanoic acids or oils. the nucleotide sequence of this region showed a 1,782-bp poly (3-hydroxyalkanoate) (pha) synthase gene (phac(ac) [i.e., the phac  gene from a. caviae]) together with four open reading frames (orf1, -3, -4, and -5) and one putative promoter region. the cloned fragments could not only complement pha-negative mutants of alcaligenes eutrophus and pseudomonas putida,  but also confer the ability to synthesize p(3hb-co-3hhx) from octanoate or hexanoate on the mutants' hosts. furthermore, coexpression of orf1 and orf3 genes with phac(ac) in the a. eutrophus mutant resulted in a decrease in the polyester  content of the cells. escherichia coli expressing orf3 showed (r)-enoyl-coenzyme  a (coa) hydratase activity, suggesting that (r)-3-hydroxyacyl-coa monomer units are supplied via the (r)-specific hydration of enoyl-coa in a. caviae. the transconjugant of the a. eutrophus mutant expressing only phac(ac) effectively accumulated p(3hb-co-3hhx) up to 96 wt% of the cellular dry weight from octanoate in one-step cultivation.

TI  == purification and properties of amino acid racemase from aeromonas punctata subsp. caviae.
AB  == an amino acid racemase, which occurs in the cytoplasmic fraction of aeromonas punctata subsp. caviae, has been purified to homogeneity by the criteria of electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation. the enzyme has a molecular weight of about 80,000 and consists of two subunits identical in molecular weight (about 40,000). the enzyme contains 2 mol of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate per mol of enzyme, and exhibits absorption maxima at 280 nm and 420 nm. the holoenzyme is resolved by dialysis against hydroxylamine to yield the inactive apoenzyme, which is reconstituted by the addition of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate to recover the full activity. the enzyme catalyzes racemization of a number of amino acids, e.g. lysine, ornithine, ethionine, arginine, glutamine, and methionine. the michaelis  constants were determined: 1 mm for l-lysine; 0.9 mm for d-lysine; 0.9 mm for l-ornithine; 1 mm for l-arginine; and 2.6 microm for pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. this enzyme is similar in enzymological properties to the racemase of pseudomonas putida, but is distinct from it in immunochemical properties.
