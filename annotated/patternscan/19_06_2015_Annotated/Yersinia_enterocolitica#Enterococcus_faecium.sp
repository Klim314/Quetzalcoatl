TI  == inactivation of cronobacter sakazakii by ultrasonic waves under pressure in buffer and foods.
AB  == the objective of this research was to characterize the resistance of cronobacter  sakazakii to ultrasonic waves under pressure (manosonication, ms). the d(ms) value (decimal reduction time value) of c. sakazakii in standard conditions (35 degrees c, 117 mum, 200 kpa, citrate-phosphate buffer ph 7.0) was 0.41 min. this  value was higher than that of yersinia enterocolitica (d(ms)=0.19 min) and lower  than those of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis (d(ms)=0.61 min), listeria  monocytogenes (d(ms)=0.86 min), and enterococcus faecium (d(ms)=1.2 min). strain  studied (atcc 29544, nctc 8155, 9238, and 9529), growth temperature (10, 20, 30,  and 37 degrees c), and ph of the treatment media (4.0, 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0) did not significantly change c. sakazakii ms resistance. conversely, entry into stationary growth phase, decreasing water activity of the treatment media (0.98,  0.96, and 0.94), and treatment in food products (apple and orange juices, chicken and vegetable soups, and rehydrated powdered milk) resulted in up to a 1.6-, 3.9-, and 2.5-fold maximum change in d(ms) values, respectively. whereas an exponential relationship between the amplitude of ultrasonic waves and d(ms) values was found, the relationship between static pressure and d(ms) values was better described by a quadratic equation. the energy transferred into the medium  determined the lethality of the ultrasonic waves regardless of the combination of pressure (0, 50, 100, 200 and 300 kpa) and amplitude (34, 62, 90, 117 and 145 mum) applied. there was an exponential relationship between d(ms) values and the  power input: an increase of 134 w increased the inactivation rate ten times regardless of the treatment medium. no c. sakazakii cells with sublethally injured cytoplasmic membrane or with sublethal oxidative damage occurred after ms treatments, but the results indicated that damage to the outer membrane preceded  microbial death.

TI  == antilisterial activity of a broad-spectrum bacteriocin, enterocin lr/6 from enterococcus faecium lr/6.
AB  == enterocin lr/6, a purified bacteriocin, exhibited broad inhibitory spectrum both  against related as well as some food-borne pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, aeromonas sp., shigella sp., and bacillus licheniformis. in this investigation, we have focused on l. monocytogenes as the  target organism, as it is not only an important pathogen but can also survive over a wide range of environmental conditions such as refrigeration temperature,  low ph, and high-salt concentration. this allows the pathogen to overcome many food preservation and safety barriers and poses a potential risk to human health. the enterocin lr/6 showed a bactericidal action against l. monocytogenes and completely inhibited the growth on agar plates, supplemented with 200 au/ml of enterocin lr/6. the effectiveness of enterocin lr/6 in completely killing a population of acid-adapted (ph 5.2, 2 h) l. monocytogenes exposed to different temperatures (4-37 degrees c), ph (2.5-8.0), and osmotic (up to 30% nacl) stress  is reported here. this paper focuses on the key issue of killing of the acid-adapted l. monocytogenes cells under adverse environmental conditions.

TI  == isolation and purification of enterocin e-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as  antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis,  s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20  other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment  with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability  by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized  with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.

TI  == contamination of milk by enterococci and coliforms from bovine faeces.
AB  == aim: to determine the contribution of enterococci and coliforms from bovine faeces and teats to contamination of raw milk. methods: putative enterococci (n = 301) and coliforms (n = 365) were isolated from bovine faeces (n = 20), cows' teats (n = 20), the raw milk (n = 1) and the milking environment (n = 4) on one farm. the clonal relationships of each bacterial group were investigated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of genomic macrorestriction fragments. representatives of the different clusters of enterococci were identified by molecular techniques including rep-pcr, sds protein profiling, fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (faflp), phenylalanyl-trna synthase (phes) sequence analysis and/or 16s rdna gene sequencing. coliforms were identified by api 20e strips. results: the majority of the bovine faecal enterococcal isolates  were identified as a potential new species of aerococcus (100 isolates); e. faecium (28 isolates), and aerococcus viridans (28 isolates) were also found. all coliform isolates from the bovine faeces were identified as escherichia coli. the coliforms present in the milk were hafnia alvei, serratia liquefaciens, yersinia  enterocolitica and enterobacter amnigenus. no e. coli, enterococcus or aerococcus from the bovine faeces were found in the milk. a single clone of h. alvei was found in the water, the milking equipment and the milk, suggesting that the water was the source of the organism in the milk. no vancomycin-resistant aerococci or  enterococci were found while most of the isolates tested showed the presence of at least one virulence gene. the milk-sock retained strains that adhered to particulate faecal material. coliforms were present at approx. 2 orders of magnitude greater than enterococci in the bovine faeces. conclusions: the results imply that bovine faeces are not an important source of contamination of raw milk with enterococci or coliforms. significance and impact of the study: the results  confirm those of two previous studies (gelsomino et al. 2001, int j food microbiol71, 177-188 and kagkli et al. 2007, int j food microbiol114, 243-251) on two other farms. the three studies show that contamination of milk by enterococci, lactobacilli and coliforms of bovine faecal origin is extremely low. the results also suggest that where raw milk is implicated in food infection, other factors in addition to faecal contamination must be involved.

TI  == spectroscopic quantification of bacteria using artificial neural networks.
AB  == fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, in conjunction with artificial neural networks, has been used for identification and classification of selected foodborne pathogens. five bacterial species (enterococcus faecium, salmonella enteritidis, bacillus cereus, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella boydii) and five  escherichia coli strains (o103, o55, o121, o30, o26) suspended in phosphate-buffered saline were enumerated to provide seven different concentrations ranging from 10(9) to 10(3) cfu/ ml. the trained artificial neural networks were then validated with an independent subset of samples and compared with the traditional plate count method. it was found that the concentration-based classification of the species was 100% correct and the strain-based classification was 90 to 100% accurate.

TI  == the screening of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactic acid bacteria and their application to inactivating psychrotrophic food-borne pathogens.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were isolated from various food samples and evaluated for hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) production. cells suspended in 0.5% (wt/vol) glucose plus 0.5% (wt/vol) lactate (ph 7.0) were incubated for 5 h at 37 degrees c under  aeration. among 193 strains, 27 strains accumulated 201-300 ppm h2o2, and 4 strains accumulated more than 301 ppm h2o2 in the cell suspensions. among the 9 high-level h2o2-producing strains, 8 strains were identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. the cell-free filtrate from lc. lactis subsp. lactis ai 62, which contained approximately 350 ppm h2o2, was evaluated for antimicrobial activity against enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, listeria ivanovii, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, and aeromonas hydrophila. after 1 h incubation at 30 degrees c in the cell-free filtrate, the initial viable cell counts of the target bacteria (5.53-6.00 log cfu/ml) were reduced by 0.12-5.00 log units, except in the case of enterococci. the sensitivity varied with the bacterial species and ph. the enterococci were resistant to the treatment. our results show that h2o2 accumulated by lactic acid bacteria in a cell suspension is very effective in reducing the viable cell count of food-borne pathogens.

TI  == angiotensin i-converting-enzyme-inhibitory and antibacterial peptides from lactobacillus helveticus pr4 proteinase-hydrolyzed caseins of milk from six species.
AB  == sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of lactobacillus helveticus pr4. peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. the fractions which showed the highest angiotensin i-converting-enzyme (ace)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and edman degradation analyses. various ace-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine alpha(s1)-casein (alpha(s1)-cn) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and beta-cn f58-76; ovine alpha(s1)-cn f1-6 and alpha(s2)-cn f182-185 and f186-188; caprine beta-cn f58-65  and alpha(s2)-cn f182-187; buffalo beta-cn f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human beta-cn. a mixture of peptides with a c-terminal sequence, pro-gly-pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. the highest ace-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ace inhibitor (s)-n-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 micro g/ml (100 micro mol/liter). several of the above sequences had features in  common with other ace-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. the 50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 micro g/ml). some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ace-inhibitory activity and ic(50)s were confirmed. an antibacterial peptide corresponding to beta-cn f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. it showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as enterococcus faecium, bacillus megaterium, escherichia coli, listeria innocua, salmonella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, and staphylococcus aureus. the mic for e. coli f19 was ca. 50 micro g/ml. once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of l. helveticus pr4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.

TI  == identification of a streptogramin a acetyltransferase gene in the chromosome of yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == streptogramins are polypeptide antibiotics inhibiting protein synthesis by the prokaryotic ribosome. gram-positive organisms are susceptible to streptogramins,  while most gram-negative bacteria are intrinsically resistant. we have found a genomic fragment from a yersinia enterocolitica isolate with an open reading frame coding for a polypeptide similar to the virginiamycin acetyltransferases found in various plasmids from gram-positive bacteria. the susceptible escherichia coli strain db10 was transformed to resistance to the type a streptogramins and to mixed (a + b) streptogramins upon introduction of a plasmid containing that gene. in addition, we showed streptogramin acetylating activity in vitro dependent on the presence of the y. enterocolitica sat gene. southern blot hybridization experiments showed that the sat gene was present in all the y. enterocolitica isolates examined. these data together show that the gene in the y. enterocolitica chromosome encoded an active streptogramin acetyltransferase. the deduced sequence of the y. enterocolitica sat protein was close to those of sat gene products found in gram-positive bacteria and cyanobacteria, suggesting a common evolutionary origin.

TI  == resistance to antimicrobial agents used for animal therapy in pathogenic-, zoonotic- and indicator bacteria isolated from different food animals in denmark: a baseline study for the danish integrated antimicrobial resistance monitoring programme (danmap).
AB  == this study describes the establishment and first results of a continuous surveillance system of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria isolated from pigs, cattle and broilers in denmark. the three categories of bacteria tested were: 1) indicator bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium), 2) zoonotic bacteria (campylobacter coli/jejuni, salmonella enterica, yersinia enterocolitica), and 3) animal pathogens (e. coli,  staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus hyicus, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae). a total of 3304 bacterial isolates collected from october 1995 through december 1996 were tested for susceptibility  to all major classes of antimicrobial agents used for therapy in denmark. bacterial species intrinsically resistant to an antimicrobial were not tested towards that antimicrobial. acquired resistance to all antimicrobials was found.  the occurrence of resistance varied by animal origin and bacterial species. in general, resistance was observed more frequently among isolates from pigs than from cattle and broilers. the association between the occurrence of resistance and the consumption of the antimicrobial is discussed, as is the occurrence of resistance in other countries. the results of this study show the present level of resistance to antimicrobial agents among a number of bacterial species isolated from food animals in denmark. thus, the baseline for comparison with future prospective studies has been established, enabling the determination of trends over time.

TI  == surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from food animals to antimicrobial growth promoters and related therapeutic agents in denmark.
AB  == this study was conducted to describe the occurrence of acquired resistance to antimicrobials used for growth promotion among bacteria isolated from swine, cattle and poultry in denmark. resistance to structurally related therapeutic agents was also examined. three categories of bacteria were tested: 1) indicator  bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium), 2) zoonotic bacteria (campylobacter, salmonella, yersinia enterocolitica), and 3) animal pathogens (e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus hyicus, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae). all antimicrobials used as growth promoters in denmark and some structurally related  therapeutic agents (in brackets) were included: avilamycin, avoparcin (vancomycin), bacitracin, carbadox, flavomycin, monensin, olaquindox, salinomycin, spiramycin (erythromycin, lincomycin), tylosin (erythromycin, lincomycin), and virginiamycin (pristinamycin). bacterial species intrinsically resistant to an antimicrobial were not tested towards that antimicrobial. breakpoints for growth promoters were established by population distribution of the bacteria tested. a total of 2,372 bacterial isolates collected during october 1995 to september 1996 were included in the study. acquired resistance to all currently used growth promoting antimicrobials was found. a frequent occurrence of resistance were observed to avilamycin, avoparcin, bacitracin, flavomycin, spiramycin, tylosin and virginiamycin, whereas resistance to carbadox, monensin,  olaquindox and salinomycin was less frequent. the occurrence of resistance varied by animal origin and bacterial species. the highest levels of resistance was observed among enterococci, whereas less resistance was observed among zoonotic bacteria and bacteria pathogenic to animals. the association between the occurrence of resistance and the consumption of the antimicrobial is discussed. the results show the present level of resistance to growth promoters in bacteria  from food animals in denmark. they will form the baseline for comparison with future prospective studies, thereby enabling the determination of trends over time.

TI  == a microbiology investigation on probiotic pharmaceutical products used for human  health.
AB  == many and different probiotic pharmaceutical products are presently commercialised in the world. on this regard, a microbiological investigation was carried out to  screen the microorganisms incorporated into these products, commonly used for human health. after determination of the cell number and viability of bacteria, several experiments were performed in vitro in order to characterise the microorganisms and to evaluate their probiotic value. among all the strains identified, best results were obtained with lactobacillus rhamnosus, enterococcus faecium and saccharomyces cerevisiae as far as regards growth rates, ph and bile  salts tolerance. moreover, the identification profiles of microorganisms showed a better reliability for the products containing a single species whereas the ones  composed of different strains were usually not satisfactory. in some cases, the presence of lactobacillus and saccharomyces species was in disagreement with the  claimed composition of the product and some species of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and streptococci were found not viable. in defined mixed cultures  experiments, the antagonism of lactobacillus acidophilus and enterococcus faecium versus yersinia enterocolitica was demonstrated and explained as acid and/or antimicrobials production.
