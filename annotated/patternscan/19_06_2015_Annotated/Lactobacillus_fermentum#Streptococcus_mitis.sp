TI  == screening of probiotic candidates in human oral bacteria for the prevention of dental disease.
AB  == the oral cavity in healthy subjects has a well-balanced microbiota that consists  of more than 700 species. however, a disturbance of this balance, with an increase of harmful microbes and a decrease of beneficial microbes, causes oral disorders such as periodontal disease or dental caries. nowadays, probiotics are  expected to confer oral health benefits by modulating the oral microbiota. this study screened new probiotic candidates with potential oral health benefits and no harmful effects on the oral cavity. we screened 14 lactobacillus strains and 36 streptococcus strains out of 896 oral isolates derived from healthy subjects.  these bacteria did not produce volatile sulfur compounds or water-insoluble glucan, had higher antibacterial activity against periodontal bacteria, and had higher adherence activity to oral epithelial cells or salivary-coated hydroxyapatite in vitro. we then evaluated the risk of primary cariogenicity and  infective endocarditis of the selected oral isolates. as a result, lactobacillus  crispatus yit 12319, lactobacillus fermentum yit 12320, lactobacillus gasseri yit 12321, and streptococcus mitis yit 12322 were selected because they showed no cariogenic potential in an artificial mouth system and a lower risk of experimental infective endocarditis in a rat model. these candidates are expected as new probiotics with potential oral health benefits and no adverse effects on general health.

TI  == streptococcus mitis induces conversion of helicobacter pylori to coccoid cells during co-culture in vitro.
AB  == helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) is a major gastric pathogen that has been associated with humans for more than 60,000 years. h. pylori causes different gastric diseases including dyspepsia, ulcers and gastric cancers. disease development depends on several factors including the infecting h. pylori strain,  environmental and host factors. another factor that might influence h. pylori colonization and diseases is the gastric microbiota that was overlooked for long  because of the belief that human stomach was a hostile environment that cannot support microbial life. once established, h. pylori mainly resides in the gastric mucosa and interacts with the resident bacteria. how these interactions impact on h. pylori-caused diseases has been poorly studied in human. in this study, we analyzed the interactions between h. pylori and two bacteria, streptococcus mitis and lactobacillus fermentum that are present in the stomach of both healthy and gastric disease human patients. we have found that s. mitis produced and released one or more diffusible factors that induce growth inhibition and coccoid conversion of h. pylori cells. in contrast, both h. pylori and l. fermentum secreted factors that promote survival of s. mitis during the stationary phase of growth. using a metabolomics approach, we identified compounds that might be responsible for the conversion of h. pylori from spiral to coccoid cells. this study provide evidences that gastric bacteria influences h. pylori physiology and therefore possibly the diseases this bacterium causes.

TI  == shifts in the microbial population in relation to in situ caries progression.
AB  == the shift in microbial diversity from young to mature plaque, related to caries activity on sound and restored surfaces, was studied using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. during a 20-week in situ study on caries progression 8 subjects wearing restored and unrestored dentin and enamel sections, biofilm was  sampled after 1 and 20 weeks (young or mature plaque). a higher microbial diversity (mature plaque) was seen in caries-active compared to caries-free subjects. rothia dentocariosa and scardovia inopinata were absent from all caries-free sites, but appeared in 50% of the caries-active sites.

TI  == phylogenetic group- and species-specific oligonucleotide probes for single-cell detection of lactic acid bacteria in oral biofilms.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to design and evaluate fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) probes for the single-cell detection and enumeration of lactic acid bacteria, in particular organisms belonging to the major phylogenetic groups and species of oral lactobacilli and to abiotrophia/granulicatella. results: as lactobacilli are known for notorious resistance to probe penetration, probe-specific assay protocols were experimentally developed to provide maximum cell wall permeability, probe accessibility, hybridization stringency, and fluorescence intensity. the new assays were then applied in a pilot study to three biofilm samples harvested from variably demineralized bovine enamel discs that had been carried in situ for 10 days by different volunteers. best probe penetration and fluorescent labeling of reference strains were obtained after combined lysozyme and achromopeptidase treatment followed by exposure to lipase.  hybridization stringency had to be established strictly for each probe. thereafter all probes showed the expected specificity with reference strains and  labeled the anticipated morphotypes in dental plaques. applied to in situ grown biofilms the set of probes detected only lactobacillus fermentum and bacteria of  the lactobacillus casei group. the most cariogenic biofilm contained two orders of magnitude higher l. fermentum cell numbers than the other biofilms. abiotrophia/granulicatella and streptococci from the mitis group were found in all samples at high levels, whereas streptococcus mutans was detected in only one sample in very low numbers. conclusions: application of these new group- and species-specific fish probes to oral biofilm-forming lactic acid bacteria will allow a clearer understanding of the supragingival biome, its spatial architecture and of structure-function relationships implicated during plaque homeostasis and caries development. the probes should prove of value far beyond the field of oral microbiology, as many of them detect non-oral species and phylogenetic groups of importance in a variety of medical conditions and the food industry.

TI  == extractability of cell wall polysaccharide from lactobacilli and streptococci by  autoclaving and by dilue acid.
AB  == autoclaving cell wall of streptococcus mutans ingbritt for 15 min under the rantz and randall conditions released one-tenth of the total cell wall carbohydrate, whereas two-thirds was extracted after autoclaving for 180 min. the extract contained the serotype c-specific antigen but lacked the lipoteichoic acid component extracted when whole cells were autoclaved. autoclaving cell wall preparations from other strains of s. mutans and also streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis in 0.85% nacl for 180 min released the major proportion of the wall polysaccharide fraction. approximately 50 to 90% of wall carbohydrate of lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus casei was released when cell wall preparations were autoclaved in 0.85% nacl for 180 min. for wall preparations from several strains of s. mutans, autoclaving for 60 min at ph 3.75 released only 39 to 62% of wall carbohydrate, whereas almost total release could be achieved with the lactobacilli. heating s. mutans ingbritt cell wall for 24 h at  60 degrees c in 0.1 n h(2)so(4) released only two-thirds of the wall carbohydrate; by comparison nearly all of the wall carbohydrate was released in 3 h from l. casei and l. fermentum. autoclaving l. casei cell wall and purified soluble wall fractions hydrolyzed the phosphodiester bond between the polysaccharide and peptidoglycan. this was shown by the release of reactive n-acetylhexosamine in both cases and the presence of a phosphomonoester in the autoclaved soluble wall fractions. the results indicate that autoclaving can hydrolyze covalent linkages, and this must be considered when the rantz and randall procedure is used to obtain antigen preparations.

TI  == origin of esterases in human whole saliva.
AB  == whole saliva of 59 healthy persons was used for determination of esterase activity. the pattern of esterase was studied by means of isoelectrofocusing on thin-layer acrylamide gels. the esterases found in whole saliva are suggested to  be derived from the cells of the tissue in the oral cavity. this origin is indicated (e.g.) by comparison between isolectrophoretic esterase patterns of whole saliva, submandibular saliva, gingival biopsy and fibroblast culture. antisera against partially purified saliva esterases were produced in rabbits. these sera, used in immunoelectro-osmophoresis, gave esterase-active immunoprecipitate against whole saliva, the water-soluble materials of disrupted  gingival biopsy and fibroblast culture, but not against the material of the bacteria, streptococcus sanguis, strptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus and lactobacillus fermentum.
