TI  == antimicrobial activity of brazilian propolis extracts against rumen bacteria in vitro.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of three brazilian propolis extracts was evaluated on  bacterial strains representing major rumen functional groups. the extracts were prepared using different concentrations of propolis and alcohol, resulting in different phenolic compositions. the propolis extracts inhibited the growth of fibrobacter succinogenes s85, ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1, ruminococcus albus  7, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens d1, prevotella albensis m384, peptostreptococcus sp. d1, clostridium aminophilum f and streptococcus bovis pearl11, while r. albus 20, prevotella bryantii b(1)4 and ruminobacter amylophilus h18 were resistant to all  the extracts. the inhibited strains showed also different sensitivity to propolis; the hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria (c. aminophilum f and peptostreptococcus sp. d1) being the most sensitive. inhibition of hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria by propolis would be beneficial to the animal. the extract containing the lowest amount of phenolic compounds (llos c3) showed the lowest antimicrobial activity against all the bacteria. the major phenolic compounds identified in the propolis extracts (naringenin, chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and artepillin c) were also evaluated on four sensitive strains.  only naringenin showed inhibitory effect against all strains, suggesting that naringenin is one of the components participating to the antibacterial activity of propolis.

TI  == non-sporing anaerobes in certain surgical group of patients.
AB  == the magnitude of non-sparing anaerobic (nsa) infections has been defined in the postoperative wounds on colorectum in children (57.1%), general surgery (0%), abdominoperineal and uterocervical operations (11-45%) in gynaecologic and obstetrical cases and perforative peritonitis (25.8-32.3%). children below the 6  months age group bear less risk of acquiring nsa infection. under certain situations, metronidazole combats nsa infections in a better way than other antibacterials. the bacteriology of nsa infections has been probed at the species level in the gynaecologic and obstetrical patients. the species of normal cervix  (44.6%) are represented in wounds involving abdominal wall (11%), perineum (22.8%) and uterocervix (45.6%) to suggest endogenous infection. out of the 22 species of nsa isolated, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, acidaminococcus fermentans and peptococcus prevotii are the commonest. others were peptococcus niger, gaffkya anaerobia, lactobacillus bulgaricus, actinomyces bovis, bacteroides oralis, fusobacterium gonidiaformans and the different species of peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium, propionibacterium and fusobacterium. the weight of evidence indicated a pathogenic role of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and ruminococcus flavefaciens, in view of their heavy growth. the umbrella of antibacterials reduced gram-positive anaerobic cocci from 40% to 16%. the facultative anaerobes staph aureus, staph epidermidis, kl pneumoniae and proteus appeared as the exogenous agents of nosocomial infections.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of ruminococcus flavefaciens, the type species of the genus ruminococcus, does not support the reclassification of streptococcus hansenii and peptostreptococcus productus as ruminococci.
AB  == the 16s rrna gene sequence of the type strain of ruminococcus flavefaciens, the type species of the genus ruminococcus, was determined by pcr direct sequencing.  a comparative sequence analysis showed that r. flavefaciens is phylogenetically related to a small cluster (cluster iv of collins et al. [m. d. collins, p. a. lawson, a. willems, j. j. cordoba, j. fernandez-garayzabal, p. garcia, j. cai, h. hippe, and j. a. e. farrow, int. j. syst. bacteriol. 44:812-826, 1994]) of organisms which includes several clostridium and eubacterium species. r. flavefaciens was found to be phylogenetically only remotely related to ruminococcus gnavus, ruminococcus torques, peptostreptococcus productus, and streptococcus hansenii. these findings demonstrate that the genus ruminococcus is not a monophyletic group, and the proposed transfer of p. productus and s. hansenii to this genus (t. ezaki, n. li, y. hashimoto, h. miura, and h. yamamoto, int. j. syst. bacteriol. 44:130-136, 1994) is not supported.

TI  == fermentation of isolated pectin and pectin from intact forages by pure cultures of rumen bacteria.
AB  == studies on the rate and extent of galacturonic acid and isolated pectin digestion were carried out with nine strains of rumen bacteria (butyrivibrio fibrisolvens h10b and d16f, bacteroides ruminicola 23 and d31d, lachnospira multiparus d15d, peptostreptococcus sp. d43e, b. succinogenes a3c, ruminococcus flavefaciens b34b, and r. albus 7). only three strains, 23, d16f, and d31d, utilized galacturonic acid as a sole energy source, whereas all strains except a3c and h10b degraded (solubilized) and utilized purified pectin. nutrient composition of the basal medium and separate sterilization of the substrate affected the rate and extent of fermentation for both substrates. pectin degradation and utilization were measured with two maturity stages each of intact bromegrass and alfalfa. for bromegrass i, all strains tested (b34b, 23, d16f, d31d, d15d, and d43e) degraded  a considerable amount of pectin and, with the exception of b34b, utilized most of what was degraded. similar, but lower, results were obtained with bromegrass ii,  except for the two strains of b. ruminicola, 23 and d31d, which were unable to degrade and utilize pectin from this forage. all strains were able to degrade and utilize pectin from both maturity stages of alfalfa; however, values were considerably lower for strains 23 and d31d. synergism studies, in which a limited utilizing strain, b34b, was combined with the limited degrading strain, d31d, resulted in a slight increase in degradation and a very marked increase in utilization of the pectin in all four forages. similar results were obtained on both alfalfa substrates with a combination of strains b34b and d16f; however, no  increases were observed with this combination on bromegrass.

TI  == carbon dioxide requirement of various species of rumen bacteria.
AB  == the carbon dioxide requirement of 32 strains of rumen bacteria, representing 11 different species, was studied in detail. increasing concentrations of co(2) were added as nahco(3) to a specially prepared co(2)-free medium which was tubed and inoculated under nitrogen. prior depletion of co(2) in the inoculum was found to  affect the level of requirement; however, the complexity and buffering capacity of the medium did not appear to be involved. an absolute requirement for co(2) was observed for eight strains of bacteroides ruminicola, three strains of bacteroides succinogenes, four strains of ruminococcus flavefaciens, two strains  of lachnospira multiparus, one strain of succinimonas amylolytica, and two strains of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. inconsistent growth responses were obtained in co(2)-free media with one strain each of b. fibrisolvens, ruminococcus albus,  and selenomonas ruminantium. growth of six additional strains of b. fibrisolvens, and single strains of eubacterium ruminantium and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens was markedly increased or stimulated by increasing concentrations of co(2). peptostreptococcus elsdenii b159 was the only organism tested which appeared to have no requirement, either absolute or partial, for co(2). higher concentrations of co(2) were required for the initiation of growth, as well as for optimal growth, by those species which produce succinic acid as one of their primary end  products.

TI  == enzymatic studies of pure cultures of rumen microorganisms.
AB  == joyner, a. e., jr. (university of california, davis), and r. l. baldwin. enzymatic studies of pure cultures of rumen microorganisms. j. bacteriol. 92:1321-1330. 1966.-the activities of enzymes representing the major pathways of  carbohydrate metabolism and anaerobic electron transport in cell-free extracts of whole rumen contents have been reported. the effects of diet upon the activities  of several enzymes suggested that enzymatic measurements might prove useful for the study of rumen metabolism. in the present study, the distribution and characteristics of aldolase, succinate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, lactyl-coenzyme a dehydrase, lactate dehydrogenase, and other enzymes were measured in cell-free extracts of pure cultures of ruminococcus flavefaciens, r.  albus, bacteroides succinogenes, b. ruminicola, b. amylophilus, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, peptostreptococcus elsdenii, streptococcus bovis, and selenomonas ruminantium. some enzymes were widely distributed (aldolase, glutamate dehydrogenase), whereas others were observed in one or two species (lactyl-coenzyme a dehydrase). the cofactor requirements and kinetic characteristics of enzymes varied considerably with species. enzymes that vary with species might be employed as indices for estimating the activities of various groups of microorganisms in whole rumen contents.

TI  == importance of the isovalerate carboxylation pathway of leucine biosynthesis in the rumen.
AB  == certain anaerobic ruminal bacteria synthesize the leucine carbon skeleton by use  of a pathway different from that described in other microorganisms. these organisms carboxylate the intact carbon skeleton of isovalerate, synthesizing leucine-2-c(14) from isovalerate-1-c(14). strains of bacteroides ruminicola and peptostreptococcus elsdenii were like ruminococcus flavefaciens in that they incorporated appreciable amounts of c(14) from isovalerate-1-c(14) into cellular  protein and in that the only labeled amino acid found was leucine. the specific activity of beta-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase in extracts from r. flavefaciens and from the mixed bacterial population from the rumen was very low as compared with the specific activity of this enzyme in extracts from escherichia coli. this suggests that the pathway of leucine biosynthesis that operates in many aerobic and facultative microorganisms is not the major pathway in rumen bacteria. this was supported by the finding that after fermentation of whole rumen contents with acetate-2-c(14), leucine from the bacterial cells had a specific activity lower than one would expect if acetate was incorporated directly into carbons 1 and 2 of leucine.
