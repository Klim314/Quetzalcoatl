TI  == locus of enterocyte effacement: a pathogenicity island involved in the virulence  of enteropathogenic and enterohemorragic escherichia coli subjected to a complex  network of gene regulation.
AB  == the locus of enterocyte effacement (lee) is a 35.6 kb pathogenicity island inserted in the genome of some bacteria such as enteropathogenic escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic e.coli, citrobacter rodentium, and escherichia albertii.  lee comprises the genes responsible for causing attaching and effacing lesions, a characteristic lesion that involves intimate adherence of bacteria to enterocytes, a signaling cascade leading to brush border and microvilli destruction, and loss of ions, causing severe diarrhea. it is composed of 41 open reading frames and five major operons encoding a type three system apparatus, secreted proteins, an adhesin, called intimin, and its receptor called translocated intimin receptor (tir). lee is subjected to various levels of regulation, including transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulators located  both inside and outside of the pathogenicity island. several molecules were described being related to feedback inhibition, transcriptional activation, and transcriptional repression. these molecules are involved in a complex network of  regulation, including mechanisms such as quorum sensing and temporal control of lee genes transcription and translation. in this mini review we have detailed the complex network that regulates transcription and expression of genes involved in  this kind of lesion.

TI  == a genomic island in salmonella enterica ssp. salamae provides new insights on the genealogy of the locus of enterocyte effacement.
AB  == the genomic island encoding the locus of enterocyte effacement (lee) is an important virulence factor of the human pathogenic escherichia coli. lee typically encodes a type iii secretion system (t3ss) and secreted effectors capable of forming attaching and effacing lesions. although prominent in the pathogenic e. coli such as serotype o157:h7, lee has also been detected in citrobacter rodentium, e. albertii, and although not confirmed, it is likely to also be in shigella boydii. previous phylogenetic analysis of lee indicated the genomic island was evolving through stepwise acquisition of various components. this study describes a new lee region from two strains of salmonella enterica subspecies salamae serovar sofia along with a phylogenetic analysis of lee that provides new insights into the likely evolution of this genomic island. the salmonella lee contains 36 of the 41 genes typically observed in lee within a genomic island of 49, 371 bp that encodes a total of 54 genes. a phylogenetic analysis was performed on the entire t3ss and four t3ss genes (escf, escj, escn,  and escv) to elucidate the genealogy of lee. phylogenetic analysis inferred that  the previously known lee islands are members of a single lineage distinct from the new salmonella lee lineage. the previously known lineage of lee diverged between islands found in citrobacter and those in escherichia and shigella. although recombination and horizontal gene transfer are important factors in the  genealogy of most genomic islands, the phylogeny of the t3ss of lee can be interpreted with a bifurcating tree. it seems likely that the lee island entered  the enterobacteriaceae through horizontal gene transfer as a single unit, rather  than as separate subsections, which was then subjected to the forces of both mutational change and recombination.
