TI  == synthesis, optimization, and characterization of silver nanoparticles from acinetobacter calcoaceticus and their enhanced antibacterial activity when combined with antibiotics.
AB  == background: the development of nontoxic methods of synthesizing nanoparticles is  a major step in nanotechnology to allow their application in nanomedicine. the present study aims to biosynthesize silver nanoparticles (agnps) using a cell-free extract of acinetobacter spp. and evaluate their antibacterial activity. methods: eighteen strains of acinetobacter were screened for agnp synthesis. agnps were characterized using various techniques. reaction parameters were optimized, and their effect on the morphology of agnps was studied. the synergistic potential of agnps on 14 antibiotics against seven pathogens was determined by disc-diffusion, broth-microdilution, and minimum bactericidal concentration assays. the efficacy of agnps was evaluated as per the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoints of the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guidelines. results: only a. calcoaceticus lrvp54 produced agnps within 24 hours. monodisperse spherical nanoparticles of 8-12 nm were obtained with 0.7 mm silver nitrate at 70 degrees c. during optimization, a  blue-shift in ultraviolet-visible spectra was seen. x-ray diffraction data and lattice fringes (d =0.23 nm) observed under high-resolution transmission electron microscope confirmed the crystallinity of agnps. these agnps were found to be more effective against gram-negative compared with gram-positive microorganisms.  overall, agnps showed the highest synergy with vancomycin in the disc-diffusion assay. for enterobacter aerogenes, a 3.8-fold increase in inhibition zone area was observed after the addition of agnps with vancomycin. reduction in mic and minimum bactericidal concentration was observed on exposure of agnps with antibiotics. interestingly, multidrug-resistant a. baumannii was highly sensitized in the presence of agnps and became susceptible to antibiotics except  cephalosporins. similarly, the vancomycin-resistant strain of streptococcus mutans was also found to be susceptible to antibiotic treatment when agnps were added. these biogenic agnps showed significant synergistic activity on the beta-lactam class of antibiotics. conclusion: this is the first report of synthesis of agnps using a. calcoaceticus lrvp54 and their significant synergistic activity with antibiotics resulting in increased susceptibility of multidrug-resistant bacteria evaluated as per mic breakpoints of the clsi standard.

TI  == antimicrobial efficacy and phytochemical analysis of indigofera trita linn.
AB  == an in vitro antimicrobial activity and phytochemical analysis of various extracts of indigofera trita l. viz. petroleum ether, chloroform, acetone, ethanol and aqueous extracts were carried out. a total of 21 microorganisms (19 bacteria and  2 fungal strains) were used for antimicrobial activity by disc diffusion method and a standard procedure was used to identify the phytochemical constituents. petroleum ether extract showed moderate inhibitory activity against staphylococcus aureus (14.40 mm), s. epidermidis (14.20 mm), salmonella paratyphi a (12.80 mm), streptococcus mutans (12.20 mm), escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, s. typhi and burkholderia cepacia (12.00 mm). the chloroform extract also showed antimicrobial activity against s. epidermidis (14.20 mm), s. typhimurium (12.60 mm), s. paratyphi a, s. brunei and yersinia enterocolitica (12.00 mm). the acetone extract of i. trita showed considerable inhibitory activity against s. epidermidis (18.20 mm), s. typhimurium (14.60 mm), s. infantis (13.80 mm), s. aureus (13.40 mm), y. enterocolitica (13.00 mm) and enterobacter aerogenes (12.00 mm) were documented. ethanol extract showed significant antimicrobial activity against s. epidermidis (18.60 mm), s. paratyphi a (14.60 mm), y. enterocolitica (13.40 mm), s. typhi (12.40 mm), s. aureus, e. aerogenes, s. typhimurium and s. infantis (12.00 mm). aqueous extract  of i. trita considerably inhibited s. epidermidis (13.80 mm), s. paratyphi a and  y. enterocolitica (12.20 mm), e. aerogenes and haemophilus parahaemolyticus (12.00 mm). all the five extracts showed a minimal antifungal activity when compared to antibacterial activity. the result revealed that the antimicrobial properties of i. trita might be associated with the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, tannins, glycosides, saponins, phytosterols and alkaloids.

TI  == chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of four different anatolian propolis samples.
AB  == propolis means a gum that is gathered by bees from various plants. it is known for its biological properties, having antibacterial, antifungal and healing properties. the aims of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of four different anatolian propolis samples on different groups of microorganisms including some oral pathogens and comparison between their chemical compositions. ethanol extracts of propolis (eep) were prepared from four different anatolian propolis samples and examined whether eep inhibit the growth of the test microorganisms or not. for the antimicrobial activity assays, minimum inhibitory  concentrations (mic) were determined by using macrodilution method. the mic values of the most effective propolis (tb) were 2 microg/ml for streptococcus sobrinus and enterococcus faecalis, 4 microg/ml for micrococcus luteus, candida albicans and c. krusei, 8 microg/ml for streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterobacter aerogenes, 16 microg/ml for escherichia coli and c. tropicalis and 32 microg/ml for salmonella typhimurium and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the chemical compositions of eep's were determined by high-temperature high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. the main compounds of four anatolian propolis samples were flavonoids such as pinocembrin, pinostropin, isalpinin, pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine and chrysin. although propolis samples were collected from different regions of anatolia all showed significant antimicrobial activity against the gram positive bacteria and yeasts. propolis can prevent dental caries since it demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms such as streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus and c. albicans, which involves in oral diseases.

TI  == a system to generate chromosomal mutations in lactococcus lactis which allows fast analysis of targeted genes.
AB  == a system for generating chromosomal insertions in lactococci is described. it is  based on the conditional replication of lactococcal pwv01-derived ori+ repa- vector pori19, containing lacz alpha and the multiple cloning site of puc19. chromosomal alui fragments of lactococcus lactis were cloned in pori19 in repa+ helper strain escherichia coli ec101. the frequency of campbell-type recombinants, following introduction of this plasmid bank into l. lactis (repa-), was increased by combining the system with temperature-sensitive pwv01 derivative pve6007. transformation of l. lactis mg1363 (pve6007) with the pori19 bank of lactococcal chromosomal fragments at the permissive temperature allowed replication of several copies of a recombinant plasmid from the bank within a cell because of the provision in trans of repa-ts from pve6007. a temperature shift to 37 degrees c resulted in loss of pve6007 and integration of the pori19 derivatives at high frequencies. a bank of lactococcal mutants was made in this way and successfully screened for the presence of two mutations: one in the monocistronic 1.3-kb peptidoglycan hydrolase gene (acma) and one in the hitherto  uncharacterized maltose fermentation pathway. reintroduction of pve6007 into the  mal- mutant at 30 degrees c resulted in excision of the integrated plasmid and restoration of the ability of ferment maltose. the integration plasmid (pmal) was rescued by using the isolated plasmid content of a restored mal+ colony to transform e. coli ec101. nucleotide sequencing of the 564-bp chromosomal fragment in pmal revealed an internal part of an open reading frame of which the translated product showed significant homology with atp-binding proteins malk of  e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, and enterobacter aerogenes and msmk of streptococcus mutans. this combined use of two types of conditional replicating pwv01-derived vectors represents a novel, powerful tool for chromosomal gene inactivation, targeting, cloning, and sequencing of the labelled gene.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of chlorhexidine in a controlled release delivery system.
AB  == chlorhexidine is widely used as a mouth rinse in the prevention and treatment of  periodontal diseases and dental caries. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial effect of chlorhexidine in a controlled release delivery system. the controlled release dispenser comprised a polymeric inner core matrix containing the medicament with an outer vinyl membrane controlling the drug release. the effect on the following bacteria was studied: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mutans, wolinella recta, bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, eikenella corrodens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae. chlorhexidine-containing vinyl patches with a diameter of 5.5 mm were placed on blood agar plates containing the various bacteria. the plates were incubated aerobically or anaerobically at 37 degrees c for 24 h or longer, when appropriate, and examined for inhibition of bacterial growth. distinct zones of inhibition were seen surrounding all vinyl patches on all plates with all bacteria. thus, the vinyl dispenser appeared to be an effective vehicle for releasing chlorhexidine to a localized area such as the surface of a tooth, a periodontal pocket, or a root canal.
