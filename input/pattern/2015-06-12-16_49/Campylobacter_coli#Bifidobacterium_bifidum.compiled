TI  - Mixed culture fermentation studies on the effects of synbiotics on the human intestinal pathogens Campylobacter jejuni and Escherichia coli.
AB  - Batch and continuous culture anaerobic fermentation systems, inoculated with human faeces, were utilised to investigate the antimicrobial actions of two probiotics, Lactobacillus plantarum 0407, combined with oligofructose and Bifidobacterium bifidum Bb12, combined with a mixture of oligofructose and xylo-oligosaccharides (50:50 w/w) against E. coli and Campylobacter jejuni. In batch fermenters, both E. coli and C. jejuni were inhibited by the synbiotics, even when the culture pH was maintained at around neutral. In continuous culture C. jejuni was inhibited but the synbiotic failed to inhibit E. coli. Although no definitive answer in addressing the mechanisms underlying antimicrobial activity was derived, results suggested that acetate and lactate directly were conferring antagonistic action, rather than as a result of lowering culture pH. In the course of the study culturing and fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) methodologies for the enumeration of bacterial populations were compared. Bifidobacterial populations were underestimated using plating techniques, suggesting the non-culturability of certain bifidobacterial species.
TI  - In vitro investigations of the effect of probiotics and prebiotics on selected human intestinal pathogens.
AB  - Abstract This study investigated the effects of selected probiotic microorganisms, in combination with prebiotics, on certain human intestinal food-borne pathogens. Probiotics grown with different carbohydrate sources were observed to inhibit growth of Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella enteritidis, with the extent of inhibition varying according to the carbohydrate source provided. Prebiotics identified as being preferentially utilised by the probiotics tested were oligofructose (FOS), inulin, xylo-oligosaccharide (XOS), and mixtures of inulin:FOS (80:20 w/w) and FOS:XOS (50:50 w/w). Two of the probiotics, Lactobacillus plantarum and Bifidobacterium bifidum were selected for further co-culture experiments. Each was combined with the selected prebiotics, and was observed to inhibit pathogen growth strongly. Results suggested that acetate and lactate were directly conferring antagonistic action, which was not necessarily related to a lowering of culture pH.
TI  - Antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin B, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the N-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  - A physiologically diverse range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin B, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. The list of susceptible organisms includes Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens. Concentrations of lactoferricin B required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and the culture medium used. The peptide showed activity against E. coli O111 over the range of pH 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. Its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of Na+, K+, Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. Lactoferricin B was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterococcus faecalis and Bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.
