purification and characterization of a surface-binding protein from lactobacillus fermentum rc-14 that inhibits adhesion of enterococcus faecalis 1131.
lactobacilli have been shown to be important in the maintenance of the healthy urogenital flora. one strain, lactobacillus fermentum rc-14, releases surface-active components which can inhibit adhesion of uropathogenic bacteria. using a quantitative method for determining inhibition of adhesion, a protein with high anti-adhesive properties against enterococcus faecalis 1131 was purified. the n-terminal sequence of the 29-kda protein was identical to that of a collagen-binding protein from lactobacillus reuteri ncib 11951, and exhibited close homology with a basic surface protein from l. fermentum br11. the results suggest that this anti-adhesive cell surface protein of lactobacillus could protect against uropathogens by preventing their adhesion. the federation of european microbiological societies.
