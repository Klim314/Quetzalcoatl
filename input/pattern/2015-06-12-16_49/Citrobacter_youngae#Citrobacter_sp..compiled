TI  - Multilocus sequence analysis of the genus Citrobacter and description of Citrobacter pasteurii sp. nov.
AB  - Strains originating from various sources and classified as members of the genus Citrobacter within family Enterobacteriaceae, were characterized by sequencing internal portions of genes rpoB, fusA, pyrG and leuS, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, average nucleotide identity of genomic sequences and biochemical tests. Phylogenetic analysis based on the four housekeeping genes showed that the 11 currently described Citrobacter species are well demarcated. Strains CIP 55.13T and CIP 55.9 formed a distinct branch associated with C. youngae. Average nucleotide identity between CIP 55.9 and CIP 55.13T was 99.19% whereas it was 94.75% between CIP 55.13T and strain CIP 105016T of C. youngae, its closest species. Biochemical characteristics consolidated the fact that the two isolates represent a separate species, for which the name Citrobacter pasteurii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CIP 55.13T (= DSM 28879T).
TI  - Distribution of chitin/chitosan-like bioflocculant-producing potential in the genus Citrobacter.
AB  - Some strains belonging to the genera Citrobacter and Enterobacter have been reported to produce chitin/chitosan-like bioflocculants (BFs) from acetate. In this study, to investigate the distribution of the BF-producing potential in the genus Citrobacter and to screen stably and highly BF-producing strains, we obtained 36 Citrobacter strains from different culture collection centers, which were distributed among seven species in the genus, and tested for the flocculating activities of their culture supernatants using a kaolin suspension method. As a result, 21 strains belonging to C. freundii (17 strains in 23 strains tested), C. braakii (two in two), C. youngae (one in one), and C. werkmanii (one in two) showed flocculating activity, but this ability was limited to cells grown on acetate. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis of the hydrolysates from the BFs of five selected strains indicated that they consisted of glucosamine and/or N-acetylglucosamine, such as the chitin/chitosan-like BF (BF04) produced by Citrobacter sp. TKF04 (Fujita et al. J Biosci Bioeng 89: 40-46, 2000). Gel filtration chromatography using a high-performance liquid chromatography system revealed that the molecular weight ranges of these BFs varied, but the average sizes were all above 1.66 x 10(6)Da.
TI  - Classification of citrobacteria by DNA hybridization: designation of Citrobacter  farmeri sp. nov., Citrobacter youngae sp. nov., Citrobacter braakii sp. nov., Citrobacter werkmanii sp. nov., Citrobacter sedlakii sp. nov., and three unnamed Citrobacter genomospecies.
AB  - DNA relatedness studies (hydroxyapatite method) were done on 112 strains of citrobacteria. By using the recommended definition of a genomospecies 11 genomospecies were identified in the genus Citrobacter. These genomospecies were separable by their biochemical profiles. Citrobacter koseri (Citrobacter diversus) and Citrobacter amalonaticus proved to be homogeneous species, as previously described. C. amalonaticus biogroup 1, as described by Farmer et al. (J. Clin. Microbiol. 21:46-76, 1985), was shown to be a separate homogeneous species, which was named Citrobacter farmeri sp. nov. The Citrobacter freundii complex was quite heterogeneous. C. freundii sensu stricto, as represented by the type strain, contained only 9 of 66 strains in this complex. The remaining 57 strains were members of seven genomospecies. Genomospecies 5, containing 21 strains, was named Citrobacter youngae sp. nov. Genomospecies 6, containing 15 strains, was named Citrobacter braakii sp. nov. Genomospecies 7 and 8, each containing six strains, were named Citrobacter werkmanii sp. nov. and Citrobacter sedlakii sp. nov., respectively. Genomospecies 9, 10, and 11, each containing three strains, were not named.
