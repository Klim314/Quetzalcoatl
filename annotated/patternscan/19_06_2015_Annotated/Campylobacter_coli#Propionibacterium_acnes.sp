TI  == [role of infectious agents in the emergence of malignant tumors].
AB  == according to the data of the international agency for research on cancer (iarc),  at least 6 virus species (hpv, ebv, hhv-8/kshv, htlv-1, hbv, hcv), 4 helminthes species (schistosoma haematobium and japonicum, opisthorchis viverrini, clonorchis sinensis) and i bacterium species (helicobacter pylori) have been proved to be capable of causing the development of cancer. the analysis of the data available shows that merkel cell polyomavirus (mcv), herpes simplex virus (hsv), john cunningham polyomavirus (jcv), monkey virus 40 (sv40), cytomegalovirus (cmv), xenotropic murine leukemia virus (xmrv), helicobacter bilis and hepaticus, campylobacter jejuni, fusobacterium varium, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides vulgatus, prevotella spp., streptococcus bovis and anginosus, treponema denticola, salmonella typhi, paratyphi and typhimurium, borrelia burgdorferi, bartonella spp., mycobacterium tuberculosis, chlamydia pneumoniae, trachomatis and psittaci, neisseria gonorrhoeae, propionibacterium acnes, tropheryma whippelii, schistosoma mansoni, opistorchis felineus, strongyloides stercoralis, taenia solium, candida  spp., paracoccidioides brasiliensis, histoplasma capsulatum and trichomonas vaginalis can also be potential etiological agents of cancer. apparently, detection of new associations between infectious agents and risk of the development of cancer will facilitate progress in elaboration of prophylaxis measures, early diagnostic methods and, probably, methods of treatment of malignant tumors.

TI  == in vitro study of the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against recent clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, was studied by a standardized single disc method. a total of 990 clinical isolates were tested, including 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria. ofloxacin was highly active against 683 strains (70.41%), had intermediate activity against 109 (11.23%) and had no activity against 178 (18.35%). ofloxacin was highly active against e. coli, klebsiella sp., citrobacter sp., proteus mirabilis, proteus morganii, salmonella sp., campylobacter jejuni, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, eubacterium sp., propionibacterium acnes and streptococcus sp. pseudomonas sp., serratia sp. and proteus vulgaris had percentages of resistance to ofloxacin of 37.11%, 32% and 33.33% respectively. high percentages of resistance to ofloxacin  were found only for providencia sp., proteus rettgeri and bacteroides fragilis. with regard to streptococcus faecalis, the results obtained with the disc procedure were not reliable and mic determination was necessary to assess the behaviour of the drug.

TI  == an electrophoretic analysis of superoxide dismutase in campylobacter spp.
AB  == superoxide dismutase (sod, superoxide:superoxide reductase, ec 1.15.1.1) activity was studied in 23 strains of campylobacter spp. using disc polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. different enzyme patterns were observed with extracts of different species of campylobacter; three migration bands were found in all strains of c. sputorum subsp. sputorum and c. sputorum subsp. bubulus (relative mobilities, rm, 0.57, 0.76 and 0.85), and c. fetus subsp. fetus (rm 0.60, 0.72 and 0.81), while four migration bands (rm 0.52, 0.57, 0.73 and 0.82) were found in c. fetus subsp. venerealis. one band (rm 0.73) was found in c. coli cip 7080 and two bands (rm 0.59, 0.73) in c. jejuni cip 702. superoxide dismutase activities were very high in the campylobacter strains, especially in c. fetus subsp. fetus [specific activity 7.8-55.7 u (mg protein)-1] compared with those in escherichia coli (1.5 u mg-1), propionibacterium acnes (1.6 u mg-1) and veillonella alcalescens (0.2 u mg-1).
