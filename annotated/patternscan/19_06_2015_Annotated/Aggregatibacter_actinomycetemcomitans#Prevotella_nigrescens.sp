TI  == periodontitis associated with plasminogen deficiency: a case report.
AB  == background: plasminogen deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disease, which is associated with aggressive periodontitis and gingival enlargement. previously  described treatments of plasminogen deficiency associated periodontitis have shown limited success. this is the first case report indicating a successful therapy approach consisting of a non-surgical supra- and subgingival debridement  in combination with an adjunctive systemic antibiotic therapy and a strict supportive periodontal regimen over an observation period of 4 years. case presentation: the intraoral examination of a 17-year-old turkish female with severe plasminogen deficiency revealed generalized increased pocket probing depths ranging from 6 to 9 mm, bleeding on probing over 30%, generalized tooth mobility, and gingival hyperplasia. alveolar bone loss ranged from 30% to 50%. clinical attachment loss corresponded to pocket probing depths. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, prevotella  intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and eikenella corrodens have been detected by realtime polymerase chain reaction. periodontal treatment consisted of full mouth disinfection and adjunctive systemic administration of amoxicillin (500 mg tid) and metronidazole (400 mg tid). a strict supportive periodontal therapy regimen every three month in terms of supra- and subgingival debridement was rendered. the reported therapy has significantly improved periodontal health and arrested disease progression. intraoral examination at the end of the observation period 3.5 years after non-surgical periodontal therapy showed generalized decreased pocket probing depths ranging from 1 to 6 mm, bleeding on probing lower 30%, and  tooth mobility class i and ii. furthermore, microbiological analysis shows the absence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola after therapy. conclusion: adjunctive antibiotic treatment may alter the oral microbiome and thus, the inflammatory response of periodontal disease associated to plasminogen deficiency and diminishes the risk of pseudomembrane formation and progressive attachment loss. this case report indicates that patients with plasminogen deficiency may benefit from non-surgical periodontal treatment in combination with an adjunctive antibiotic therapy and a strict supportive periodontal therapy regimen.

TI  == occurrence of periodontal pathogens in ethnic groups from a native brazilian reservation.
AB  == objective: the present study was designed to evaluate the occurrence of periodontal pathogens in the subgingival biofilm of 100 native brazilians living  at the umutina indian reservation, mato grosso state, brazil. methods: periodontal clinical examinations were carried out prior to collection of subgingival biofilm, and the presence of 14 periodontal microorganisms was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the prevalence and risk analysis was performed using cochran and mantel-haenszel statistics for dichotomous variables or pearson's chi-squared test for analysis of proportions when variables had three or more categories. the interrelations between clinical and microbiological parameters were assessed using fisher's exact test and the mann-whitney u test. results: individuals with chronic periodontitis were frequently colonized by the association between porphyromonas gingivalis and campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis and prevotella intermedia, or p. gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. patients with chronic periodontitis were also colonized by porphyromonas gulae and p. intermedia or by the association between p. gulae and t. forsythia. p. gulae was detected only in the subgingival samples from natives on a traditional diet. gingival bleeding was associated with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, t. forsythia, p.  gingivalis, p. gulae, porphyromonas endodontalis, p. intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens. treponema denticola was uncommon. conclusions: peculiar microbiota was demonstrated to be associated with different periodontal disease statuses in  native brazilians, with modest occurrence of certain pathogens, such as t. denticola, and the presence of p. gulae in natives with gingivitis or chronic periodontitis.

TI  == distribution of 8 periodontal microorganisms in family members of chinese patients with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == objective: to date, no information on the distribution of periodontal microorganisms among family members of chinese patients with aggressive peridontitis (agp) is available. the aim of the present study was to investigate  the probability of transmission of eight periodontal microorganisms between patients with aggressive periodontitis and their family members. design: saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples were collected from 103 participants from 41 nuclear families (including 41 agp probands, 19 mothers, 22 fathers, 21 siblings). eight periodontal microorganisms, including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema  denticola, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum were detected in these samples by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). in addition, the distribution of fima genotypes was assessed in p. gingivalis-positive individuals by pcr. results: p. gingivalis, t. forsythia,  t. denticola, c. rectus and f. nucleatum were the most frequently detected species both in agp probands and in their relatives. kappa statistical analysis revealed that the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans (kappa = 0.503) and f. nucleatum (kappa = 0.565) in probands was highly consistent with that in their relatives. most probands shared the identical fima genotype of p. gingivalis with their relatives. conclusions: our results suggested that the intrafamilial transmission of periodontal microorganisms may occur between chinese patients with aggressive periodontitis and their relatives.

TI  == combinatorial effects of amoxicillin and metronidazole on selected periodontal bacteria and whole plaque samples.
AB  == objective: the aim of the present study was to analyze in vitro the combinatorial effects of the antibiotic combination of amoxicillin plus metronidazole on subgingival bacterial isolates. design: aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum  and eikenella corrodens from our strain collection and subgingival bacteria isolated from patients with periodontitis were tested for their susceptibility to amoxicillin and metronidazole using the etest. the fractional inhibitory concentration index (fici), which is commonly used to describe drug interactions, was calculated. results: synergy, i.e. fici values </= 0.5, between amoxicillin and metronidazole was shown for two a. actinomycetemcomitans (fici: 0.3), two f.  nucleatum (fici: 0.3 and 0.5, respectively) and one e. corrodens (fici: 0.4) isolates. indifference, i.e. fic indices of >0.5 but </=4, occurred for other isolates and the 14 p. intermedia/nigrescens strains tested. microorganisms resistant to either amoxicillin or metronidazole were detected in all samples by  etest. conclusion: combinatorial effects occur between amoxicillin and metronidazole on some strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and e. corrodens. synergy was shown for a few strains only.

TI  == the effects of different orthodontic appliances upon microbial communities.
AB  == objectives: orthodontic appliances can promote accumulation of dental plaque, with associated enamel decalcification or gingival inflammation. the aim of this  study was to examine longer-term microbiological changes during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. materials and methods: twenty-four orthodontic patients aged 11-14 years undergoing fixed appliance therapy were recruited into  the study. each was randomized for cross-mouth assignment of molar bands and bonded molar tubes to contralateral quadrants of the mouth. all patients received self-ligating brackets, but again using randomization, one upper lateral incisor  bracket (left or right) also received an elastomeric ligature. plaque samples from the molars and upper lateral incisors were obtained at intervals during treatment and up to 1 year after appliance removal. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16s rdna microarray were used to compare plaque microbial fingerprints. results: plaque populations changed within 3 months of commencing treatment at all sites. the greatest differences in plaque composition were seen  with self-ligating brackets with an elastomeric ligature. post-treatment plaque associated with both types of molar attachment contained increased levels of periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and eubacterium nodatum, while campylobacter rectus, parvimonas micra, and actinomyces odontolyticus were also elevated with bonds. conclusions: the results suggest that orthodontic treatment may cause sustained changes in plaque microbiotas and that molar bond-associated plaque may have raised disease potential.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (itcs) extracted from horseradish (armoracia rusticana) root against oral microorganisms.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (itcs) extracted from horseradish root was investigated against oral microorganisms: 6 strains of facultative anaerobic bacteria, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus casei, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; one strain of yeast, candida albicans, and 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella nigrescens, and clostridium perfringens. the itcs extracted from horseradish root showed antimicrobial activity against all oral microorganisms by the paper disk method.  the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of the itcs extracted from horseradish root ranged from 1.25 to 5.00 mg/ml against 6 strains of facultative  anaerobic bacteria and one strain of yeast, and 4.17 to 16.67 mg/ml against 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria. the itcs extracted from horseradish root showed the strongest antimicrobial activity, with a mbc of 1.25 mg/ml, against c. albicans among facultative microorganisms, and 4.17 mg/ml against f. nucleatum among anaerobic bacteria. these results suggest that the itcs extracted from horseradish root may be a candidate for use as an antimicrobial agent against oral microorganisms.

TI  == efficacy of a new mouth rinse formulation based on 0.07% cetylpyridinium chloride in the control of plaque and gingivitis: a 6-month randomized clinical trial.
AB  == aim: to assess the efficacy of a 0.07% cetylpyridinium chloride (cpc) mouth rinse in the control of plaque and gingival inflammation during a 6-month period. material and methods: adult subjects with moderate gingivitis were selected [>/=40% bleeding on marginal probing (bomp)]. after retrieving microbiological samples and evaluating the clinical parameters (plaque, bomp and stain indexes),  a professional prophylaxis was performed and subjects were randomly assigned to the test (cpc mouth rinse) or to the placebo group. subjects were re-assessed after 3 and 6 months. results: a total of 67 patients (35 test, 32 placebo) were  included in the analysis. at 6 months, intra-group significant plaque reductions  were observed in the test group (0.691, p < 0.001), but not in the placebo (0.181, p = 0.653). at 6 months, the mean bomp values were lower in the test group (p = 0.052). changes between baseline and 6 months were significantly higher in the test group both for plaque (p = 0.002) and bomp (p = 0.037) when compared with the placebo. a microbiological impact was observed in the test group, especially for prevotella intermedia. conclusion: the evaluated 0.07% cpc-based mouth rinse, used three times per day adjunctively to mechanical tooth  cleaning, prevents plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation, as compared to  the placebo, for at least 6 months.

TI  == subgingival root brushing in deep human periodontal pockets.
AB  == objective: the short-term clinical and microbiological effects of patient-applied subgingival root brushing were assessed on untreated deep human periodontal pockets. methods: assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, total cultivable subgingival counts, and cultivable counts and proportions of six putative periodontal pathogens were carried out at baseline and after 14 days on  two contralateral > or = 6 mm bleeding interproximal posterior sites in each of 11 adults with untreated chronic periodontitis. one of the sites was randomly assigned to daily patient-applied subgingival root brushing for 14 days, and the  other to remain with the patient's pre-existing tooth brushing and flossing regimen. no other periodontal therapy was performed during the 14 test days. results: significant reductions in plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, total subgingival counts, and levels of putative periodontal pathogens were found after 14 days of subgingival root brushing. subgingival root brushing nearly eliminated bleeding on probing at test sites, reduced probing depths by a mean of 1.8 mm, and reduced cultivable subgingival proportions of six evaluated putative  periodontal pathogens from a cumulative total of 14.1% to 0.8%. in comparison, no significant clinical or microbiological changes were detected after 14 days where the patient's pre-existing oral hygiene regimen remained unaltered. conclusions:  subgingival root brushing over 14 days, in properly trained patients, induced favorable clinical and microbiological changes in deep periodontal pockets > or = 6 mm even in the absence of professional subgingival debridement.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in human chronic periodontitis microbiota.
AB  == background: patients with chronic periodontitis (cp) may yield multiple species of putative periodontal bacterial pathogens that vary in their antibiotic drug susceptibility. this study determines the occurrence of in vitro antibiotic resistance among selected subgingival periodontal pathogens in patients with cp.  methods: subgingival biofilm specimens from inflamed deep periodontal pockets were removed before treatment from 400 adults with cp in the united states. the samples were cultured, and selected periodontal pathogens were tested in vitro for susceptibility to amoxicillin at 8 mg/l, clindamycin at 4 mg/l, doxycycline at 4 mg/l, and metronidazole at 16 mg/l, with a post hoc combination of data for  amoxicillin and metronidazole. gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads were subjected to ciprofloxacin disk-diffusion testing. results: overall, 74.2% of the patients with cp revealed subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to at least one of the test antibiotics. one or more test species, most often prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, streptococcus constellatus, or aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, were resistant in vitro to doxycycline, amoxicillin, metronidazole, or clindamycin, in 55%, 43.3%, 30.3%, and 26.5% of the patients with cp, respectively. fifteen percent of patients harbored subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to both amoxicillin and metronidazole, which were mostly either s. constellatus (45 individuals) or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains of gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads (nine individuals). conclusions: patients with cp in the united states frequently yielded subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant in vitro to therapeutic concentrations of antibiotics commonly used in clinical periodontal practice. the wide variability  found in periodontal pathogen antibiotic-resistance patterns should concern clinicians empirically selecting antibiotic treatment regimens for patients with  cp.

TI  == detection of eight periodontal microorganisms and distribution of porphyromonas gingivalis fima genotypes in chinese patients with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: the microbiologic feature of aggressive periodontitis (agp) in chinese patients has not yet been determined. this study aims to investigate the  prevalence of eight periodontal microorganisms and the distribution of the porphyromonas gingivalis fima genotype in a cohort of chinese patients with agp.  methods: saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples were collected from 81 patients with agp (25 with incisor-first molar type and 56 with generalized type  [gagp]) and 34 periodontally healthy controls. eight periodontal microorganisms,  including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and fusobacterium nucleatum were detected in these samples by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). in addition, the distribution of fima genotypes was assessed in p. gingivalis-positive individuals by pcr. results: the prevalence of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, t. denticola, c. rectus, p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, and a. actinomycetemcomitans in patients with agp was significantly higher than that in healthy controls. the prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans in patients with gagp was relatively low (30.4%) compared with other pathogens. results of logistic regression analysis showed that younger patients were more likely to harbor a. actinomycetemcomitans (odds ratio = 2.85). type ii was the most prevalent fima genotype of p. gingivalis in patients with agp. conclusions: p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, t. denticola, c. rectus, p. intermedia, and f. nucleatum were the predominant periodontal pathogens of patients with gagp in china. type ii of fima was the most prevalent genotype of p. gingivalis in patients with agp. the prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans in patients with gagp was relatively low.

TI  == detection and enumeration of periodontopathogenic bacteria in subgingival biofilm of pregnant women.
AB  == the aim of this study was to use the fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) technique to test the hypothesis of qualitative and quantitative differences of 8 periodontopathogens between pregnant and non-pregnant women. this cross-sectional study included 20 pregnant women in their second trimester of pregnancy and 20 non-pregnant women. probing depth, bleeding on probing, clinical attachment level, and presence of calculus were recorded. subgingival plaque samples were collected and the fish technique identified the presence and numbers of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens. the mann-whitney u-test was applied to compare the data between the two groups. the mean age, ethnicity, marital status, education, and economic level in both groups were similar. the clinical parameters showed no significant differences between pregnant and non-pregnant women. the numbers of subgingival periodontopathogens were not found to be significantly different between groups, despite the higher mean counts of p. intermedia in pregnant women. colonization patterns of the different bacteria  most commonly associated with periodontal disease were not different in the subgingival plaque of pregnant and non-pregnant women.

TI  == genome-wide association study of periodontal pathogen colonization.
AB  == pathological shifts of the human microbiome are characteristic of many diseases,  including chronic periodontitis. to date, there is limited evidence on host genetic risk loci associated with periodontal pathogen colonization. we conducted a genome-wide association (gwa) study among 1,020 white participants of the atherosclerosis risk in communities study, whose periodontal diagnosis ranged from healthy to severe chronic periodontitis, and for whom "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization quantification of 8 periodontal pathogens was performed. we examined 3 traits: "high red" and "high orange" bacterial complexes, and "high" aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) colonization. genotyping was performed on the affymetrix 6.0 platform. imputation to 2.5 million markers was based on hapmap ii-ceu, and a multiple-test correction was applied (genome-wide threshold  of p < 5 x 10(-8)). we detected no genome-wide significant signals. however, 13 loci, including kcnk1, fbxo38, uhrf2, il33, runx2, trps1, camta1, and vamp3, provided suggestive evidence (p < 5 x 10(-6)) of association. all associations reported for "red" and "orange" complex microbiota, but not for aa, had the same  effect direction in a second sample of 123 african-american participants. none of these polymorphisms was associated with periodontitis diagnosis. investigations replicating these findings may lead to an improved understanding of the complex nature of host-microbiome interactions that characterizes states of health and disease.

TI  == subgingival microbiota from cebus apella (capuchin monkey) with different periodontal conditions.
AB  == this present study evaluated the subgingival microbiota of the cebus apella with  different periodontal conditions kept by the tufted capuchin monkey procreation center (sao paulo state university - unesp) or free-ranging monkeys. for this purpose, clinical specimens of subgingival biofilm were collected from 52 monkeys, of both genders, 40 kept in captivity and 12 free-ranging monkeys. the primates were submitted to periodontal evaluation and biofilm samples were transferred to vmga iii transport medium and ultrapure water. the microbiota was  cultivated in selective and non-selective culture media and microbial dna was extracted and the presence of periodontal pathogens was evaluated using pcr and real-time pcr. the actinomycetes, fusobacteria, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobic rods, tannerella forsythia, staphylococci and streptococci represent the predominantly detected microorganisms. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, dialister pneumosintes and prevotella nigrescens were rarely observed, whereas treponema denticola was not found. populations of c. rectus, e. corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia and the total microbial load were significantly higher in animals with bone loss and, in smaller extension, in animals with gingival bleeding.

TI  == butyric acid induces apoptosis in both human monocytes and lymphocytes equivalently.
AB  == short-chain fatty acids (scfas) are metabolites from anaerobic periodontopathic bacteria that induce apoptosis in immune cells such as lymphocytes, monocytes and macrophages. however, it remains unclear if scfas from pathogens induce apoptosis in monocytes/macrophages similarly with lymphocytes. this study investigated whether scfas-induced apoptosis is equal among the immunoregulatory cells. cell apoptosis of the employed human cells was evaluated after treatment with culture  supernatants from various periodontopathic bacteria or sodium butyrate. apoptosis and viability were determined by detection of dna fragmentation and using an mts  assay kit, respectively. porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum culture filtrates strongly induced apoptosis whereas prevotella nigrescens and prevotella intermedia culture filtrates failed to induce apoptosis in the thp-1 and u937 human monocyte and macrophage cell lines. healthy gingival fibroblasts and oral epithelial cells were resistant to all the culture filtrates. gas-liquid chromatography detected butyric acid in p. gingivalis (21.0-34.0 mm) and f. nucleatum (36.0 mm) in culture filtrates, whereas, only trace levels were seen in p. nigrescens and p. intermedia. these results suggest that butyric acid produced by periodontopathic bacteria severely damages immunoregulatory cells in a consistent manner and, likewise, could be involved in mediating periodontal chronic inflammation.

TI  == distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in dogs and their owners.
AB  == objective: presently, a large number of individuals consider their companion animals as family members and have close contact with them in daily life. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution of periodontopathic  bacterial species in oral specimens taken from dogs and their owners. design: dental plaque specimens were collected from 66 dogs and 81 members of 64 families who came to an animal clinic or dog training school in okayama, japan, in 2011. bacterial dna was extracted from each specimen and pcr analyses using primers specific for 11 periodontopathic species, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas gulae, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens were performed. results: p. gulae (71.2%), t. forsythia (77.3%), and c. rectus (66.7%) were frequently found in the dogs, whereas the detection rates of  those species in humans were less frequent at 16.0%, 30.9%, and 21.0%, respectively. p. gulae was identified in 13 human subjects and each of their dogs was also positive for the species. furthermore, e. corrodens and t. denticola in  specimens obtained from dogs were correlated with their presence in specimens from owners who had close contact with them. conclusions: these results suggest that several periodontopathic species could be transmitted between humans and their companion dogs, though the distribution of periodontopathic species in both is generally different.

TI  == microbial profile of patients with periodontitis compared with healthy subjects.
AB  == objective: to define and compare the microbiologic profile of subgingival plaque  in german patients with periodontitis (including aggressive and advanced chronic  periodontitis) and healthy subjects and to determine significant association between isolates and clinical status. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia are major periodontal pathogens, though it is recognized that other species may also contribute to the  pathogenesis of periodontal disease. method and materials: thirty-three patients  with clinical and radiologic proof of aggressive and advanced chronic periodontitis and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. clinical indices were recorded as six-point measurements on each tooth. samples of the subgingival plaque were taken with paper points from four teeth of each individual. the samples were divided into two parts. one part was immediately cultivated, while the other one was stored at -20 degrees c until analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: a total of 284 anaerobic isolates (224 isolates from patients and 60 isolates from healthy controls) were identified. forty different anaerobic species were isolated, with a mean of 6.78  species per patient and 3 species per healthy control subject. significant differences in prevalence (after adjusting for multiple comparisons, p < .001) were found for prevotella intermedia and nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, t forsythia, treponema denticola, and veillonella parvula. the first four species were associated with the aggressive periodontitis group and v parvula with healthy subjects. conclusion: when compared with healthy controls, the microbial  profile of subgingival plaque from periodontitis was found to contain known periodontal pathogens with a different prevalence to that described in earlier studies. p intermedia/nigrescens, f nucleatum, t forsythia, and t denticola have  been found in lower proportions and small quantities in healthy subjects.

TI  == molecular detection of human periodontal pathogens in oral swab specimens from dogs in japan.
AB  == periodontal diseases are known to be major diseases in humans, and are also common in dogs. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution  of periodontitis-related bacterial species using oral swab specimens collected from 26 pet dogs. the distribution of an animal gingival organism porphyromonas gulae, in addition to 10 human periodontitis-related bacterial species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction with species-specific sets of primers. porphyromonas gulae, tannerella forsythia and campylobacter rectus were detected in almost all dogs analyzed, all of which should be regarded as common members of oral flora in dogs. then, isolation and identification of the porphyromonas species in swab specimens were performed. there were 35 strains isolated from 22 dogs, and broad-range polymerase chain reaction and sequencing methods revealed that approximately 70% of them were porphyromonas gulae. in contrast, the frequency of porphyromonas gingivalis was extremely low. these findings indicate the presence of specific periodontitis-related pathogens in pet dogs, especially porphyromonas gulae.

TI  == microbiologic changes in subgingival plaque before and during the early period of orthodontic treatment.
AB  == objective: to evaluate changes in subgingival microbiota before and during the leveling and alignment orthodontic stage using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. materials and methods: thirty orthodontic patients (17 females and  13 males; aged 16.7 +/- 6.5 y) were included in this study. subgingival microbial samples were taken from the disto-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper central incisors, the left lower central incisors, the mesio-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper first molars, and the left lower first molars, at four  different times: at baseline, before placement of orthodontic appliances (t1), and 1 week (t2), 3 months (t3), and 6 months after placement of orthodontic appliances (t4). dna was extracted from the samples, and the 16s rrna-based pcr detection method was used to determine the prevalence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, campylobactor rectus, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola, which are considered as putative periodontopathogens. results: the frequency of t forsythia, c rectus, and p nigrescens significantly increased after placement of orthodontic appliances. for the other species, the frequency tended to increase but no statistically significant difference was noted. the frequency of the change, representing microorganisms not existing at t1 but newly developing at t2, t3, and t4, was higher at the molars than at the incisors. conclusion: the placement of orthodontic appliances affects the subgingival microbial composition even during  the early period of orthodontic treatment, increasing the prevalence of periodontopathogens, especially in the molar region.

TI  == prevotella nigrescens and porphyromonas gingivalis are associated with signs of carotid atherosclerosis in subjects with and without periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: oral microorganisms may be involved in the development  of cardiovascular diseases, and porphyromonas gingivalis is one of the periodontal microorganisms that has been found in carotid atheroma. the aim of this work was to study subgingival microorganisms and early carotid lesions in subjects with and without periodontitis. material and methods: eighty-eight subjects with periodontitis and 40 subjects without periodontitis underwent dental examinations in 2003. the presence of the periodontal microorganisms aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and tannerella forsythia was analyzed from subgingival plaque using pcr amplification. the common carotid artery was scanned using ultrasound and the calculated intima-media area (cima) was measured. the association between periodontitis, the cima value and the presence of periodontal microorganisms, together with several confounders, was studied in a multiple logistic regression model. results: smoking [odds ratio (or) = 5.64; p = 0.001),  level of education (or = 5.02; p < 0.05) and the presence of p. gingivalis (or =  6.50; p < 0.05) were associated with periodontitis. explanatory factors for the increased cima were periodontitis (or = 4.22; p < 0.05), hypertension (or = 4.81; p < 0.05), high body mass index (or = 5.78; p < 0.01), male gender (or = 3.30; p  < 0.05) and poor socioeconomic status (or = 4.34; p < 0.05). p. nigrescens (or 4.08; p < 0.05) and p. gingivalis (or 7.63; p < 0.01) also appeared as explanatory variables associated with increased cima values. conclusion: this cross-sectional study showed that p. nigrescens and p. gingivalis were significantly associated with increased cima values.

AB  == purpose: the occurrence of in vitro resistance to therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole was determined for putative periodontal pathogens isolated in the united states. materials and methods: subgingival plaque specimens from 37 consecutive adults with untreated severe periodontitis were anaerobically cultured, and isolated putative periodontal pathogens were identified to a species level. in vitro resistance to spiramycin at 4 mug/ml, amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and/or metronidazole at 16 mug/ml was noted when putative periodontal pathogen growth was noted on the respective antibiotic-supplemented primary culture plates. results: a total of 18 (48.7%) subjects yielded antibiotic-resistant putative periodontal pathogens with spiramycin at 4 mug/ml in drug-supplemented primary isolation plates, as compared to 23 (62.2%) subjects with amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and 10 (27.0%) subjects with metronidazole at 16 mug/ml. spiramycin in vitro resistance occurred among species of fusobacterium nucleatum (44.4% of organism-positive subjects), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (11.1%), parvimonas micra (10.8%), streptococcus constellatus (10%), streptococcus intermedius (10%), porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%), and tannerella forsythia (5.3%). amoxicillin in vitro resistance was found in p. intermedia/nigrescens (55.5%), t. forsythia (15.8%), s. constellatus  (10%), f. nucleatum (5.6%), and p. micra (2.7%). only s. constellatus (70%) and s. intermedius (40%) exhibited in vitro resistance to metronidazole. when subject-based resistance data for spiramycin and metronidazole were jointly considered, all isolated putative periodontal pathogens were inhibited in vitro by one or the other of the antibiotic concentrations, except for one strain each  of s. constellatus and s. intermedius from one study subject. similarly, either amoxicillin or metronidazole at the drug concentrations tested inhibited in vitro all recovered putative periodontal pathogens, except s. constellatus in one subject. conclusions: in vitro spiramycin resistance among putative periodontal pathogens of united states origin occurred in approximately one-half of severe periodontitis patients evaluated, particularly among subgingival f. nucleatum species. in vitro resistance patterns also suggest that therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin plus metronidazole may have potential antimicrobial  efficacy in non-aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-associated periodontitis similar to amoxicillin plus metronidazole, which may be beneficial, where spiramycin is clinically available, for patients hypersensitive to amoxicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == effect of teenage smoking on the prevalence of periodontal bacteria.
AB  == the aim of our study was to investigate how teenage smoking affects the prevalence of periodontal bacteria and periodontal health with the hypothesis that smoking increases the prevalence of the bacteria. oral health of 264 adolescents (15- to 16-year-olds) was clinically examined, and their smoking history was recorded. the participants also filled in a structured questionnaire  recording their general health and health habits. pooled subgingival plaque samples were taken for polymerase chain reaction analysis of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola. the prevalence of p.  intermedia (21% vs. 4%, p = 0.01) and t. forsythia and t. denticola (23% vs. 8%,  p < 0.05, for both) was higher among female smokers than among non-smokers. t. forsythia and t. denticola were more often associated with bleeding on probing (29% vs. 12%; 25% vs. 10%, respectively) and deep pockets (25% vs. 15%; 23% vs. 10%, respectively) with smokers than non-smokers. among the girls, a significant  association was found between pack-years and the prevalence of p. nigrescens (p < 0.007). in both genders, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were rare in  this study. to conclude, periodontal bacteria were associated with higher periodontal index scores among all teenage smokers. smoking girls harbored more frequently certain periodontal bacteria than non-smokers, but this was not seen in boys. hence, our study hypothesis was only partly confirmed.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of diterpenes from viguiera arenaria against endodontic bacteria.
AB  == six pimarane-type diterpenes isolated from viguiera arenaria baker and two semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro against a panel of representative microorganisms responsible for dental root canal infections. the microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) against porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus faecalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid, its sodium salt and ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol were the most active, displaying mic values ranging from 1 to 10 mug ml-1. the results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new chemicals for use as a complement to instrumental endodontic procedures.

TI  == identification of periodontal pathogens and severity of periodontitis in patients with and without chronic kidney disease.
AB  == objective: in this study of patients with chronic periodontitis (cp), the severity of the disease and the main periodontal pathogens identified in patients with chronic kidney disease (ckd) were compared with those detected in individuals without systemic disease. design: nineteen patients with cp without evidence of systemic disease (control group), 25 patients with cp and ckd who were in the pre-dialysis stages (pre-dialysis group), and 22 patients with cp and ckd who were on renal replacement therapy (rrt group) were examined. the severity of cp was based on the investigation of probing depth (pd) and clinical attachment level (cal). the definition and stage of ckd were based on the criteria proposed by the kidney disease outcomes quality initiative of the national kidney foundation. glomerular filtration rate (gfr) was estimated using  the equation of modification of diet in renal disease and the identification of microorganisms in subgingival plaque was performed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: candida albicans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were more common in patients who were on rrt and pre-dialysis than in control subjects. cp was more severe in patients with ckd. a strong association was observed between the frequency of c. albicans (p =  0.056), p.gingivalis (p = 0.008), t. denticola (p = 0.013) and cal, when ckd patients were compared with the control group. conclusion: cp is more severe and  is associated with increased frequency of c. albicans, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola in patients with ckd.

TI  == the effect of a single episode of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy in the treatment of experimental periodontitis. microbiological profile and cytokine pattern in the dog mandible.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a single application of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) on microbiological profile and cytokine pattern in dogs. periodontal disease was induced by placing 3.0 silk ligatures around the mandibular pre-molars bilaterally during 8 weeks. the dogs were randomly treated with apdt using a dye/laser system, scaling and root planning (srp), or with the association of treatments (srp + apdt). plaque samples were collected at baseline, 1, 3, and 4 weeks, and the mean counts of 40 species were  determined using dna-dna hybridization. gingival biopsies were removed and the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), receptor activator of nf-kb ligand (rankl), osteoprotegerin (opg), matrix metalloproteinase (mmp-1), interleukin (il) 6, il-10 and total bacterial load by analysis of 16 s rrna gene  were evaluated through real-time pcr. the results shows that the levels of the majority of the species were reduced 1 week post-therapy for all treatments, however, an increase in counts of prevotella intermedia (p = 0.00), prevotella. nigrescens (p = 0.00) and tannerella forsythia (p = 0.00) was observed for apdt and srp + apdt. after 4 weeks, a regrowth of porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.00)  and treponema denticola (p = 0.00), was observed for all treatments. also, a strikingly reduction of counts on counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was observed for the apdt (p = 0.00). for the cytokine pattern, the results were  similar for all treatments, and a reduction in the expression of cytokines and bacterial load was observed throughout the study. our results suggest that srp, apdt in a single application, and srp + apdt affects different bacterial species  and have similar effects on the expression of cytokines evaluated during the treatment of ligature-induced periodontitis.

TI  == prevalence of periodontal bacteria in saliva of kuwaiti children at different age groups.
AB  == aggregatibacter (formerly actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis and porphyromonas gingivalis and to a lesser extent prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens, are gram-negative species that are associated with destructive periodontitis. studies from different parts of the world have shown variable detection rates of periodontal organisms. hardly any data exist on their carriage in children living in the middle east. this study was designed to determine the detection of these species in the oral cavity of 240 generally healthy kuwaiti children, divided into five age groups: <6 years (n=40), 6-9 years (n=60), 10-12 years (n=40), 13-15 years (n=40) and 16-18 years  (n=60). saliva was used as the microbiological specimen, and the samples were analyzed by molecular methods using multiplex pcr. a total of 185 (77.1%) of the  240 children were colonized by at least one of the target periodontal bacteria. in all age groups, p. nigrescens was the most prominent and detected in saliva of 15%, 32%, 63%, 50%, and 47% of the children at the five age groups, respectively. p. gingivalis was detected only occasionally. only few pathogens were found before the permanent dentition, i.e. at the age of <6 years. the highest carriage rates were from the groups between 6 and 15 years of age. the salivary carriage of the pathogens was essentially similar in the age groups of 10-12 years and 13-15 years. in conclusion, except for p. gingivalis, the examined periodontal pathogens are relatively common findings in kuwaiti children and colonize the oral cavity from childhood onwards.

TI  == competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  == objective: to investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. material and methods: the antimicrobial activity  of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains.  four probiotic bacterial species (lactobacillus bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium) were isolated from  yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. results: fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. in addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', streptococcus sanguinis. the competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. when probiotics were inoculated first, bifidobacterium inhibited porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas circumdentaria, and prevotella nigrescens; l. acidophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. circumdentaria, p. nigrescens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius; l. bulgaricus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. nigrescens; and s. thermophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and p. nigrescens. however, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens)  were inoculated simultaneously. when periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, prevotella intermedia inhibited bifidobacterium and s. thermophilus. conclusions: the results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are  capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.

TI  == [effect of periodontal mechanical treatment on periodontal pathogenic bacteria in gingival crevicular fluid of chronic periodontitis patients].
AB  == objective: to evaluate the subgingival prevalent rates of 6 periodontal pathogenic bacteria in gingival crevicular fluids of cp patients before and after treatment, to analyze the relationship between the prevalent variance and periodontal clinical parameters, and to provide a microbiologic method of evaluating curative effect and estimating the prognosis. methods: gingival crevicular fluids of 13 cp patients were collected at baseline, 2 weeks, 2 months and 4 months after periodontal mechanical treatment. also, gingival crevicular fluids were collected from 11 healthy subjects. six periodontal pathogenic bacteria including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis(pg), tannerella forsythensis (tf), prevotella intermedia (pi), fusobacterium nucleatum(fn), prevotella nigrescens (pn) were detected by 16s rrna based pcr. results: the pli, pd, bi of the cp patients 2 months and 4 months after periodontal mechanical treatment were evidently less than those before treatment. these 4 months after treatment were a little more than those 2 months  after. the six bacteria were more frequently detected in the cp patients at baseline than in healthy controls. the prevalent rates of tf (42.1%, 73.7%, 70.2%), pg (47.4%, 68.4%, 77.2%), aa (15.8%, 22.8%, 7.0%), pn (38.6%, 57.9%, 64.9%), pi(15.8%, 38.6%, 42.1%) 2 weeks, 2 months and 4 months following treatment were significantly lower than those at baseline (tf 96.5%, pg 93.0%, aa 36.8%, pn 86.0%, pi 84.2%), but the prevalent rates of all the detected bacteria  2 months after treatment were higher than those at 2 weeks after. conclusion: tf, pg, aa, pn and pi may cooperate in the development of cp. the changes of periodontal pathogenic bacteria could be detected before the changes of clinical  parameters and the patients should be re-evaluated and re-treated regularly within 2 months after treatment.

AB  == background: the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of metronidazole-amoxicillin combination on clinical and microbiologic parameters in patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis. methods: twenty-eight patients were randomly included. the test group (n = 12) received amoxicillin-metronidazole combination and scaling and root planing; the control group (n = 16) received scaling and root planing alone. in addition to the clinical examinations, subgingival plaque samples were analyzed for total cultivable bacteria and the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella pallens, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) using polymerase chain reaction. results: all clinical parameters improved significantly compared to baseline (p <0.05) in both groups. there was a statistically significant reduction of pockets and clinical attachment gain in the combined group compared to the control group (p <0.05). total counts of bacteria also decreased significantly at 3 and 6 months in both groups (p <0.05). t. denticola and t. forsythia were the most prevalent bacteria throughout the study. t. denticola showed a continuous decrease over 6 months in the test group, whereas no change was seen in the control group beyond 3 months. p. gingivalis decreased significantly at 3 months (p <0.05), whereas t. forsythia was the only  pathogen decreased below detection limits by the combination therapy with a significant difference compared to the control group (p <0.05). conclusions: the  results from this study suggest that combined amoxicillin and metronidazole use as an adjunct to scaling and root planing leads to better clinical healing compared to mechanical treatment alone. the polypharmaceutical approach used results in a significant and substantial decrease in t. forsythia and prevents its recolonization for 6 months, suggesting that t. forsythia may determine the long-term stability of periodontal treatment outcomes.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of moxifloxacin against gram-negative enteric rods from colombian patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: gram-negative enteric rods were associated with periodontal diseases  in several populations. the association between enteric and putative periodontal  pathogens has received little attention in the literature. the present investigation determined the occurrence and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates of gram-negative enteric rods from colombian patients with chronic periodontitis. methods: clinical parameters and the in vitro antimicrobial sensitivity of isolates of gram-negative enteric rods were examined in 76 patients with chronic periodontitis in medellin, colombia. subgingival samples were processed using culture and biochemical tests for the detection of periodontal and superinfecting pathogens. selected colonies of gram-negative enteric rods from pure cultures were used to test the susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. chi-square and mann-whitney tests were used to determine differences in clinical variables versus the presence or absence of gram-negative enteric rods. results: klebsiella pneumoniae was found in 12 patients, pseudomonas aeruginosa was found in four patients, and three other species were recovered with a lower prevalence. men (38.75%) tended to harbor more of the studied organisms than women (17.7%) (p = 0.04). gram-negative enteric rods in periodontal pockets correlated positively with the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (respectively, r = 0.66, 0.31, and 0.32; p <0.001). all superinfecting organisms demonstrated a high susceptibility to moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin but exhibited a variable susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. conclusions: this study found high levels of gram-negative enteric rods in  patients with chronic periodontitis. moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin appeared capable of eradicating these organisms from periodontal pockets. its good activity against gram-negative enteric rods and periodontopathogens suggests the  potential use of moxifloxacin as an adjunctive antibiotic in the treatment of mixed periodontal infections.

TI  == periodontal disease in mothers indicates risk in their children.
AB  == introduction: it is well established that severe periodontitis clusters in families, but there are no data about the relationship between mothers with chronic periodontitis and their children's periodontal status. objective: to evaluate a risk for periodontal diseases in children of periodontally diseased and healthy mothers. methods: four study groups were included: (i) 20 female patients with untreated generalized severe chronic periodontitis, (ii) their children (34), (iii) 13 periodontally healthy mothers and (iv) their children (13). material was collected from years 2004-2006. the clinical examination included registration of visible plaque index, modified gingival index and, bleeding sites on probing. periodontal microbiological samples were obtained from all study subjects and the isolates were identified according to morphology and biochemical profiles; similar interfamilial pathogens were compared by pcr-technique. results: the children of diseased mothers more frequently had periodontal diseases, especially gingivitis. in addition, clinical parameters of  gingival inflammation were more expressed and oral hygiene was worse in this group of children. vpi and vpi% of the diseased and healthy mothers differed significantly. the most common oral pathogens were p. intermedia/nigrescens and a. actinomycetemcomitans. the children of healthy mothers harboured pathogens less frequently than the children of diseased mothers. the sharing of p. intermedia/nigrescens was more frequent (5 families) than a. actinomycetemcomitans (2 families). conclusion: maternal indicators, such as periodontitis, hygiene habits, and periodontal microflora are risk factors for childhood periodontal diseases, and might be predictive of future childhood and adolescent periodontitis.

AB  == objective: to evaluate changes that occur in the subgingival microbiota after removal of fixed orthodontic appliances using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). materials and methods: thirty orthodontic patients (11 males and 19 females; aged 20 +/- 7.3 yr) were included in this study. subgingival plaque samplings were gathered from the disto-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper central incisors and the left lower central incisors, and from the mesio-buccal gingival  crevice of the left upper first molars and the left lower first molars, at two different times: 2 weeks before appliance removal (t1), and 3 months after appliance removal (t2). dna was extracted from the samples and the 16s rrna-based pcr detection method was used to determine the prevalence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans , tannerella forsythia , campylobacter rectus , eikenella corrodens , porphyromonas gingivalis , prevotella intermedia , prevotella nigrescens , and treponema denticola , which are considered as putative periodontopathogens. results: the frequency of positive sites at t1 and t2 was 65% and 43.3% for c. rectus , and 53.3% and 30.8% for e. corrodens , respectively. for the other bacteria, the frequency tended to be reduced between  times. conclusion: periodontopathogens during orthodontic treatment were significantly reduced within 3 months of appliance removal. however, how long it  takes to return to the preorthodontic composition of the subgingival microbiota and whether it happens at all remain to be seen.

TI  == quantitative detection of periodontopathic bacteria in atherosclerotic plaques from coronary arteries.
AB  == oral pathogens, including periodontopathic bacteria, are thought to be aetiological factors in the development of cardiovascular disease. in this study, the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum-periodonticum-simiae group, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and tannerella forsythia in atheromatous plaques from coronary arteries was determined by real-time pcr. forty-four patients displaying cardiovascular disease were submitted to periodontal examination and endarterectomy of coronary arteries. approximately 60-100 mg atherosclerotic tissue was removed surgically and dna was obtained. quantitative  detection of periodontopathic bacteria was performed using universal and species-specific taqman probe/primer sets. total bacterial and periodontopathic bacterial dna were found in 94.9 and 92.3 %, respectively, of the atheromatous plaques from periodontitis patients, and in 80.0 and 20.0 %, respectively, of atherosclerotic tissues from periodontally healthy subjects. all periodontal bacteria except for the f. nucleatum-periodonticum-simiae group were detected, and their dna represented 47.3 % of the total bacterial dna obtained from periodontitis patients. porphyromonas gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia were detected most often. the presence of two or more periodontal species could be observed in 64.1 % of the samples. in addition, even in samples in which a single periodontal species was detected, additional unidentified microbial dna could be observed. the significant number of periodontopathic bacterial dna species in atherosclerotic tissue samples from patients with periodontitis suggests that the presence of these micro-organisms in coronary lesions is not coincidental and that they may in fact contribute to the development of vascular diseases.

AB  == aim: to look for clinical signs of periodontal disease in young adults who exhibited radiographic bone loss and detectable numbers of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in their primary dentition. material and methods: periodontal status and radiographic bone loss were examined in each of the subjects 16 years after the baseline observations. techniques for anaerobic and selective culture, and checkerboard, were used to detect periodontitis-associated bacterial species. the isolated a. actinomycetemcomitans strains were characterized by polymerase chain reaction. results: signs of localized attachment loss were found in three out of the 13 examined subjects. a. actinomycetemcomitans was recovered from six of these subjects and two of these samples were from sites with deepened probing depths and attachment loss. among the isolated a. actinomycetemcomitans strains, serotypes a-c and e, but not d or  f, were found. none of the isolated strains belonged to the highly leucotoxic jp2 clone, and one strain lacked genes for the cytolethal distending toxin. conclusions: this study indicates that the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans and early bone loss in the primary dentition does not necessarily predispose the  individual to periodontal attachment loss in the permanent dentition.

TI  == salivary detection of periodontopathic bacteria and periodontal health status in  dental students.
AB  == objective: saliva may become a potential source of contamination through vertical and horizontal transmissions as well as cross-infections. this study aims to use  saliva as a screening tool to detect putative periodontal pathogens in a young population with fairly good oral hygiene. materials and methods: stimulated saliva samples were obtained from 134 dental students (20.5+/-1 years, range 18-22 years). among those, 77 subjects also completed a periodontal examination including attachment loss, modified dental, gingival and plaque indices (al, mdi, gi and pi). the test bacteria were identified using a 16s rrna-based pcr detection method. results: one or more of the test bacteria was found in 67% of the subjects. prevotella nigrescens was detected as single bacterium in 16% of the subjects followed by treponema denticola (4%), porphyromonas gingivalis (2%), aggregatibacter (formerly actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans (1%) and tannerella forsythia (1%). two or more pathogens were detected in 42% of the subjects. clinical examination revealed health with no attachment loss (al) in 84% of the students. in no al group, 38% of the students were pathogen free while this was 25% for students in localized al group (p>0.05). there was a statistically significant association between the detection of salivary periodontal pathogen in general and higher pi (p=0.018) and gi (p=0.043). conclusion: within the limits of this study, it is possible to detect all six periodontal pathogens in the saliva of dental students. although a correlation can be observed between the presence of salivary periodontal pathogen and clinical signs of inflammation such as plaque accumulation and gingival bleeding, detection of specific bacteria in saliva is not related to the presence of localized al based on the presented study population.

TI  == proteolytic activities of oral bacteria on prommp-9 and the effect of synthetic proteinase inhibitors.
AB  == tissue reactions to bacteria lead to proinflammatory reactions involving matrix metalloproteinases (mmps). synthetic protease inhibitors may offer new possibilities to regulate bacterial proteases. we investigated proteolytic activities of certain periodontal bacteria, their effects on the latent prommp-9, and the effects of synthetic mmp inhibitors and a serine protease inhibitor pefabloc. the strains studied were porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptoccus micros, prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, and 5 aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans serotypes. their gelatinolytic activities and the effects of certain synthetic mmp inhibitors and  pefabloc were analyzed by zymography. bacterial effects on prommp-9 conversion were investigated by western immunoblot. all investigated periodontal bacteria produced gelatinolytic cell-bound and extracellular proteinases which could fragment latent prommp-9, suggesting co-operative processing cascades in oral tissue remodeling. a. actinomycetemcomitans produced the weakest gelatinolytic activity. synthetic proteinase inhibitors exhibited slight but clear reductive effects on the bacterial proteolytic activities. we conclude that targeted anti-proteolytic treatment modalities against bacterial-host proteolytic cascades can be developed.

TI  == third molars and the efficacy of mechanical debridement in reducing pathogen levels in pregnant subjects: a pilot study.
AB  == purpose: to assess the impact of mechanical debridement (scaling and root planing), without adjunctive therapy, on reducing the numbers of periodontal pathogens detected in pregnant subjects with and without visible third molars. patients and methods: sixty-seven subjects in the second trimester of pregnancy were enrolled in an institutional review board-approved study. full mouth periodontal exams of all teeth were conducted at baseline and postpartum. presence or absence of third molars was noted. subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from the mesiobuccal of all first molars at enrollment and postpartum. subjects' total counts for periodontal pathogens in biofilm samples were determined by dna-dna checkerboard hybridization. we analyzed data from a subsample of 26 subjects. all subjects in the study were treated at enrollment by mechanical debridement of all teeth, including third molars. differences between  subjects' baseline and postpartum demographic and clinical characteristics were analyzed by chi(2) and t tests by presence or absence of third molars. statistical significance for differences in pathogen levels was determined by rank analysis of covariance. significance was set at 0.05 without correction for  multiple comparisons. results: most of the 26 subjects were african american (61%), on medicaid (92%), and did not smoke during pregnancy (88%). the 15 subjects with visible third molars were significantly older (28.0 years [sd 6.4]  vs 23.7 years [sd 3.9]). in the 11 subjects with no third molars noted, all pathogen counts were reduced postpartum. in the 15 subjects with visible third molars, total counts for each pathogen analyzed were higher postpartum as compared with subjects with no visible third molars, and their bacterial counts were increased for 5 of the 8 pathogens, including all "red cluster" pathogens. differences between study groups were observed by the presence or absence of third molars for t. forsythia and p. nigrescens (p = .04), and for p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, total "orange cluster" bacteria, and total pathogens (p < .06). conclusion: the efficacy of mechanical debridement to lower periodontal pathogen  counts during pregnancy was limited by the presence of visible third molars and should be analyzed further in larger scale trials.

TI  == microbiologic and immunologic characteristics of periodontal disease in hispanic  americans with type 2 diabetes.
AB  == background: the microbiology of periodontitis in type 1 diabetes has been reported, but less is known about type 2 diabetes. moreover, these data have not  linked microbial colonization, host response, and clinical presentation in type 1 or type 2 diabetes. the objectives of this study were to relate periodontal status, periodontal microorganisms, and host-response characteristics in hispanic americans with type 2 diabetes. methods: plaque and serum samples were obtained from 63 hispanic american subjects with and without type 2 diabetes. the microbiology of subgingival plaque samples was evaluated using dna checkerboard hybridization, and serum antibody to a battery of oral microorganisms was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: in general, similar pathogens were present in periodontitis sites from subjects with and without type 2 diabetes, although the periodontitis sites in diabetes showed a higher frequency of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and campylobacter spp. serum antibody to campylobacter rectus was elevated in type 2  diabetes, whereas antibody to p. gingivalis and c. rectus were elevated in subjects with periodontitis, irrespective of diabetes status. stratification of the population based upon antibody to p. gingivalis or c. rectus suggested a linkage between elevated antibody to p. gingivalis, increased frequency of diabetes, and significantly worse periodontitis. conclusion: the increased severity of periodontal disease with type 2 diabetes may reflect an alteration of the pathogenic potential of periodontal bacteria and/or a modification of the characteristics of the host's inflammatory response that may contribute to a breakdown in the homeostasis of the periodontium.

TI  == salivary detection of periodontopathic bacteria in periodontally healthy children.
AB  == background: salivary occurrence of periodontopathic bacteria is of interest especially in children as a risk indicator for the transmission, development and  control of periodontal disease. we assessed the prevalence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola as microbial complexes  in the saliva of children with mixed dentition and healthy gingiva. materials and methods: paraffin-stimulated saliva samples were collected from 41 children (22 boys and 19 girls), aged 6-13 years old. gingival health was determined during the initial screening exam. the test bacteria were identified using a 16s rrna-based pcr analysis. results: p. nigrescens was the most frequent species (80%), followed by t. denticola (32%), a. actinomycetemcomitans (24%) and p. gingivalis (12%). p. intermedia and t. forsythia were not detected. p. nigrescens was also common species in combinations. paired and triple bacterial combinations were found in 24% and 20% of all children, respectively. there was no positive association between bacterial combinations in colonization and subject's gender (p>0.05, fisher exact test). conclusion: the salivary presence of p. nigrescens,  t. denticola, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis but not p. intermedia and t. forsythia can occur in childhood without clinical signs of gingival disease. thus, the possible risk of bacterial transmissions through saliva and, the need to screen for periodontal pathogens should be considered before mixed dentition.

TI  == activation of toll-like receptors 2 and 4 by gram-negative periodontal bacteria.
AB  == background/aims: periodontitis is a chronic infectious disease associated with a  gram-negative subgingival microflora. bacterial components stimulate, among other receptors, toll-like receptor (tlr) 2 and/or tlr4. accumulating evidence indicates that both qualitatively and quantitatively distinct immune responses result from the triggering of tlr2 as compared to tlr4 triggering. the aim was to study the interaction of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum and veillonella parvula with tlr2 and tlr4. we investigated all known serotypes (k(-), k1-k6) of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a-e strains for their potency to stimulate cytokine production. methods: human embryonic kidney (hek) cells, stably transfected with cd14, cd14-tlr2, or cd14-tlr4 and whole blood were stimulated with bacterial sonicates. cytokine production (interleukin-6, -8, -10 and -12) was measured in the supernatant by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: all test bacteria stimulated hek-cd14-tlr2, but only a. actinomycetemcomitans and v. parvula stimulated hek-cd14-tlr4. no differences were found in the activation  of hek-cd14-tlr2/4, or cytokine production in whole blood between serotypes of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusion: gram-negative periodontal bacteria predominantly stimulated tlr2, which may be of importance for the th1/th2 cell orientation of the immune response in periodontitis.

TI  == herpesviral-bacterial synergy in the pathogenesis of human periodontitis.
AB  == purpose of review: periodontitis is an infectious disease, but the specific mechanisms by which tooth-supportive tissues are lost remain obscure. this article proposes an infectious disease model for periodontitis in which herpesviral-bacterial interactions assume a major etiopathogenic role. recent findings: epstein-barr virus type 1, cytomegalovirus and other herpesviruses occur at a high frequency in aggressive periodontitis lesions. also, herpesvirus-infected periodontitis lesions tend to harbor elevated levels of classic periodontopathic bacteria, including porphyromonas gingivalis, dialister  pneumosintes, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, treponema denticola and actinobacillus (aggregatibacter) actinomycetemcomitans. summary: conceivably, a herpesvirus active infection in the periodontium impairs  local defenses, thereby permitting overgrowth and increased aggressiveness of periodontopathic bacteria. in turn, periodontal pathogenic bacteria may augment the virulence of periodontal herpesviruses. it is suggested that interactions among herpesviruses and specific bacterial species constitute an important pathogenetic feature of periodontitis and maybe also of various non-oral infections.

TI  == prevalence of four putative periodontopathic bacteria in saliva of a group of brazilian children with mixed dentition: 1-year longitudinal study.
AB  == aim: this study aimed at evaluating the prevalence of putative periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, treponema denticola) in saliva of children with mixed dentition at two different time points, correlating these findings with a clinical parameter of gingival health. design: polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detection was used to determine the prevalence of these bacteria in saliva of 64  children in 2003 and 60 children in 2004. gingival health was assessed by gingival index. result: sixty-two (96.9%) and 50 (83.3%) children presented low gingival inflammation, whereas 2 (3.1%) and 10 (16.7%) had moderate scores in 2003 and 2004, respectively. majority of the children (81.3% in 2003 and 73.3% in 2004) had detectable levels of at least one of the bacteria. the prevalence found was of 4.7% and 1.7% for a. actinomycetemcomitans, 6.3% and 8.3% for p. gingivalis, 23.4% and 48.3% for p. nigrescens (p < 0.05), and 71.9% and 50% for t. denticola (p < 0.05) in 2003 and 2004, respectively. no significant relationship between gingival index and presence of these bacteria and combination of different species was found. conclusion: a high percentage of children harboured at least one of the putative periodontal pathogens in saliva,  but presented periodontally healthy conditions.

TI  == periodontal and oral microbiological status of an adult population undergoing haemodialysis: a cross-sectional study.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the periodontal status and oral microbiological patterns of a population with end-stage renal disease (esrd), undergoing haemodialysis (hd). design: this was a cross-sectional study, involving 52 patients from the nephrology department and 52 matched control subjects. materials and methods: the subjects had a periodontal clinical  examination; subgingival plaque samples were taken and analysed using a semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test to detect porphyromas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. subgingival plaque and saliva samples were studied for candida and enterobacteriaceae. main outcome measures: most of the 104 subjects had some degree of loss of periodontal attachment (lpa) > or =3  mm [11 (10.5%) had severe lpa; 16 (15.4%) moderate lpa; and 64 (61.5%) mild lpa]. only 13 subjects (12.5%) presented good periodontal health. results: no statistically significant differences were found between the hd patients and the  control group regarding bleeding index, number of teeth, or percentage of lpa > or =3 mm. however, a statistically significant difference was seen in the degree  of oral hygiene. conclusions: on the basis of the findings presented here, we cannot associate esrd with more severe periodontal destruction. although hd patients presented a higher number of periodontopathic microorganisms than the matched controls, a prolonged duration of hd did not bear a statistically significant relationship with the percentage of sites with lpa > or =3 mm, specific microbiota or composition of biofilm.

TI  == interleukin-1alpha stimulation in monocytes by periodontal bacteria: antagonistic effects of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == periodontal pathogenic bacteria are associated with elevated levels of interleukin-1alpha (il-1alpha) but it is unclear if all species can induce cytokine production equally. porphyromonas gingivalis may be able antagonize il-1alpha induced by other species through the activity of its proteases or lipopolysaccharide (lps). monomac-6 cells and primary human monocytes were treated with culture supernatants from porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedius, veillonella atypical and prevotella nigrescens. il-1alpha protein levels were measured after 6 h of incubation. in addition, monocytes were co-stimulated with supernatants from p. gingivalis and other bacteria. the role of p. gingivalis proteases was tested using arg-x and lys-x mutant strains. the role of lps was investigated using purified p. gingivalis lps and polymixin depletion. all species tested induced significant il-1alpha production, but p. gingivalis was the weakest. co-stimulation of monocytes with p. gingivalis antagonized the ability of other bacterial species to induce il-1alpha production. this effect was at its greatest with c. rectus (resulting in a 70% reduction). gingipain mutant strains and chemical inhibition of protease activity did not reduce antagonistic activity. however, 100 ng/ml of p. gingivalis lps can reproduce the antagonistic activity of p. gingivalis culture supernatants. periodontitis-associated bacterial species stimulate il-1alpha production by monocytes. p. gingivalis can antagonize this effect, and its lps appears to be the crucial component. this study highlights the importance of mixed infections in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease because reduction of pro-inflammatory  cytokine levels may impair the ability of the host to tackle infection.

AB  == background: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is considered a major etiologic  agent of aggressive periodontitis (agp). other periodontopathic bacteria such as  porphyromonas gingivalis are also suspected of participating in aggressive periodontitis although the evidence to support this is controversial. the aim of  the present study was to determine the prevalence of eight periodontopathic bacteria in chilean patients with agp. methods: subgingival plaque samples were collected from 36 aggressive, 30 localized, and six generalized periodontitis patients. samples from 17 advanced chronic periodontitis (cp) patients were taken as controls. samples collected from the four deepest periodontal pockets in each  patient were pooled in prereduced transport fluid (rtf) and cultured. periodontal bacteria were primarily identified by colony morphology under stereoscopic microscope and rapid biochemical tests. the identity of some bacterial isolates was confirmed by colony polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: agp showed a significatively higher prevalence of c. rectus than cp (p = 0.036). the only statistical difference found was for c. rectus. patients with agp showed a higher, but not statistically significant, prevalence of p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, p. micros, and capnocytophaga sp. a similar prevalence in both groups  of patients was observed for f. nucleatum and p. intermedia/nigrescens, and a. actinomycetemcomitans was less prevalent in agp than cp patients. in localized agp, p. intermedia/nigrescens, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, and p. micros were the more prevalent pathogens in contrast to generalized agp patients who harbored a.  actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and capnocytophaga sp. as the most prevalent bacteria. conclusions: c. rectus, p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, p. micros, and capnocytophaga sp. were the most predominant periodontopathic bacteria of agp in this chilean population, but the only statistical difference found here between agp and cp was for c. rectus, suggesting that the differences  in clinical appearance may be caused by factors other than the microbiological composition of the subgingival plaque of these patients. in this study, the prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans was much lower than that of p. gingivalis.

TI  == clinical consequences of il-1 genotype on early implant failures in patients under periodontal maintenance.
AB  == background: implant failure and biologic complications such as periimplantitis are not completely avoidable. are there any genetic and microbiologic parameters  that could be used to identify patients at risk for implant failure, preferably prior to treatment? this would result in improvement of the diagnostics, treatment decision, and risk assessment. purpose: the aims of this retrospective  study were to describe (1) the absolute failure rate of branemark system implants (nobel biocare ab, goteborg, sweden) consecutively installed over a 10-year period in partially edentulous patients treated for periodontal disease prior to  implant treatment and under regular professional maintenance, (2) the rate of interleukin-1 (il-1) polymorphism in those patients who experienced at least one  implant failure during the first year of function, and (3) the prevalence of periodontal pathogens in dental and periimplant sites with and without signs of inflammation. material and methods: of 766 patients, 81 encountered at least one  implant failure; 22 patients were clinically examined and were tested genetically for il-1 genotypes. the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella nigrescens was analyzed. results: the absolute implant survival rate for the whole population was 95.32%; 10.57% of the patients encountered an implant loss. implant loss in the examined group (n = 22) was 32 of 106 (30.1%); 10 (45%) of the 22 patients were smokers, and 6 (27%) of the 22 patients were il-1 genotype positive. patients positive for il-1 genotype  were not more prone to implant loss; however, a significant synergistic effect with smoking was demonstrated. between patients who were il-1 genotype positive and those who were il-1 genotype negative, the differences in regard to bleeding  on probing or periodontal pathogens did not reach statistical significance. conclusion: the overall implant failure rate in a population treated and maintained for periodontal disease is similar to that of healthy subjects. a synergistic effect found between smoking and a positive il-1 genotype resulted in a significantly higher implant loss. this indicates that further research with a  larger patient group should focus on multifactorial analysis for adequate risk assessment.

TI  == identification of periodontal pathogens in atherosclerotic vessels.
AB  == background: epidemiological studies have shown that periodontitis may be associated with presence of atherosclerosis. dna from periodontal pathogens has been detected in atherosclerotic lesions, but viable oral bacteria have not yet been isolated from atherosclerotic plaques. the purpose of the present study was  to determine if viable oral bacteria could be isolated from atherosclerotic lesions and if dna from periodontal pathogens could be detected by use of polymerase chain reaction (pcr) techniques. methods: seventy-nine specimens of atherosclerotic plaque removed from carotid or femoral arteries during surgery were immediately transferred to reduced transport fluid and brought to the laboratory. the calcified tissue was meticulously cut into fine pieces and used for cultivation of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, p. nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, and oral streptococci. the material from 24 of the specimens was homogenized, dna was extracted, and pcr amplification of 16s rdna with universal and specific primers was carried out. finally, the pcr products were sequenced. results: none of the samples yielded growth of the oral bacteria  under investigation. in all the 24 specimens bacterial dna was detected and likewise dna of p. intermedia was found in the samples. p. nigrescens and p. gingivalis were found sporadically. conclusions: viable oral bacteria could not be isolated from the atheromas, but the data confirm that dna of periodontal pathogens can be detected in atherosclerotic plaques. however, the finding that dna from p. intermedia constantly occured in the examined samples was new. further studies may focus on the simultaneous occurrence of identical clones of this species in subgingival plaque and atherosclerotic plaques.

TI  == clinical and microbiologic changes after removal of orthodontic appliances.
AB  == the goal of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological factors associated with orthodontic appliances during an episode of gingival inflammation and the impact of appliance removal on periodontal health. this prospective study included 10 patients, aged 12 to 20 years, with clinical signs of gingival inflammation at the final phase of orthodontic treatment (appliance removal). plaque index, gingival index, and probing depth were evaluated, and microbiological samples were collected from teeth 16, 11, and 26 at 2 times: during the gingival inflammation (baseline) and 30 days after the removal of the  appliance and professional prophylaxis. polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to detect porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens. a statistically significant improvement of the plaque and gingival indexes was seen, as well as a reduction in probing depth (p <.05). periodontal pathogens were associated with gingival inflammation during orthodontic treatment. the improvement in periodontal health at 30 days was concomitant with a reduction of  sites positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans and b. forsythus (p <.05). periodontal pathogens associated with gingival inflammation during orthodontic treatment can be significantly reduced by orthodontic appliance removal and professional prophylaxis.

AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the microbial outcome in patients with recurrent periodontal disease following treatment with 25% metronidazole gel using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). twenty subjects in a maintenance care  program but with recurrent periodontal disease participated. three months after scaling and root planing a total of 40 sites, 2 in each patient, with pocket probing depth of > or = 5 mm were selected. one site randomly selected was treated with 25% metronidazole gel (test) and the other site with a placebo gel (control). a bacterial sample was collected on paperpoint from each test and control site at baseline and 12 weeks after treatment. the following pathogens were analysed and detected with pcr:actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.),  porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.) and prevotella nigrescens (p.n.). at baseline, a.a., p.g. and p.n. were detected in 30, 60 and 70% of all test sites and in 32,  58 and 21% of all control sites. there was a statistically significant difference between the test and control sites for p.n. at baseline. the major difference after treatment with 25% metronidazole gel was the increase of positive control sites for p.g. and p.n. however, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence rate of a.a., p.g. and p.n. at test and control sites after treatment. this study has shown that 25% metronidazole gel treatment  did not seem to influence the microbial outcome, when pcr was used to analyse the presence/absence of a.a., p.g. and p.n. in this group of subjects with recurrent  periodontal disease.

TI  == effect of supragingival plaque control on subgingival microflora and gingivo-periodontal tissues.
AB  == the aim of this study was to carry out a short term evaluation of the effect of supragingival plaque control on the subgingival microflora and gingivoperiodontal tissues in patients with moderate and severe periodontitis. a total of 92 sites from 23 patients were studied; patients ranged between 35 and 60 years of age (x  46.4 +/- 1.71). plaque index (pi), gingival index (gi), bleeding on probing (bp), probing depth (pd), and attachment level (al) were measured. subgingival microflora of the same sites was studied by dark field microscopy, and cultures in non-selective and selective media for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (pi/n), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) and  fusobacterium nucleatum (fn). the patients were included in a supragingival plaque control program which included oral hygiene training and assessment, and professional control of supragingival plaque and calculus. after 28 days, measurement of clinical parameters and the microbiological study were repeated. the sites were divided according to baseline pd values into: group 1 (5 mm), group 2 (6 mm) and group 3 (> or = 7 mm). results revealed a significant reduction in pi scores, gi scores, pb and pd in groups 2 and 3. no significant difference in al was observed in any of the three groups. pi scores were found to decrease significantly in group 1, and gi scores, bp and pd tended to decrease. a significant increase in coccoid cells and a significant decrease in motile rods and spirochetes, both small and total, was observed in groups 2 and 3. group 1 showed a significant decrease in medium and total spirochetes. at the end of the  study, a significant decrease in pi/n was found in all three groups. significant  decreases were found in pg and fn in groups 3 and 2 respectively. although it holds true that supragingival plaque control reduced a potentially pathogenic subgingival microbiota, this effect was not sufficient to be compatible with healthy gingivoperiodontal tissues.

TI  == quantitative detection of periodontal pathogens using real-time polymerase chain  reaction with taqman probes.
AB  == quantitative analysis, with identification of periodontopathic bacteria, is important for the diagnosis, therapeutic evaluation and risk assessment of periodontal disease. we developed a highly sensitive and specific method using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to detect and quantify six periodontal  bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens. species-specific taqman probe/primer sets were designed according to  16s ribosomal rna gene sequences. plaque and tongue debris specimens were collected from 10 patients with advanced periodontitis and 10 periodontal healthy individuals and analyzed. all species, except for p. nigrescens, were detected in samples from diseased sites in significantly greater numbers than in those from healthy sites, whereas greater numbers of p. nigrescens were found in the controls. these results suggest that the present real-time pcr method with the designed probe/primer sets enabled sensitive detection of the six periodontal bacteria, and may also assist future microbial studies of periodontal diseases.

TI  == occurrence of periodontal bacteria in healthy children: a 2-year longitudinal study.
AB  == objectives: to examine the occurrence of specific periodontal bacteria in children and adolescents. methods: ten putative periodontal bacteria were longitudinally examined in plaque and saliva samples from 119 periodontally healthy children (2-15 years old) using a polymerase chain reaction method. results: capnocytophaga ochracea, c. sputigena, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were frequently found in saliva, and tended to persist in saliva for the remainder of the study, whereas porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia were rarely detected. p. nigrescens was more frequently detected in plaque and its prevalence increased with age. eikenella corrodens and campylobacter rectus were sometimes detected in both plaque and saliva, while tannerella forsythensis was occasionally detected in saliva. conclusion: a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, p. nigrescens, c. rectus, and e. corrodens are common members of the oral microbial  flora of healthy children, whereas p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. denticola appear to be transient organisms.

TI  == parotid salivary s-iga antibodies during experimental gingivitis in smokers and non-smokers.
AB  == persons who smoke display a less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the  experimental gingivitis model as compared with non-smokers. the aim of the present study was to investigate whether this could partly be explained by differences in levels of parotid total secretory iga (s-iga) or parotid s-iga reactive with selected oral microorganisms. parotid saliva samples were obtained  from 11 smoking and 14 non-smoking volunteers, at baseline, after 5 and 14 days of full mouth experimental gingivitis. output levels of total s-iga and of specific s-iga reactive with cell extracts from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces naeslundii, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mutans were determined in the samples by means of elisa. smokers and non-smokers were found to have similar output levels (microg/min) of total s-iga, and the values did not significantly change during the experimental gingivitis trial. parotid salivary outputs (units/min) of the bacteria-specific s-iga at baseline and at days 5 and 14, were not different between smokers and non-smokers; no changes were observed during the experimental gingivitis trial. the present observations indicate that total s-iga and bacteria-specific s-iga in saliva are not main factors that can explain the less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the experimental gingivitis model in smokers as compared with non-smokers.

TI  == [identification of periodontopathic bacteria dna from periodontitis-involved gingival tissue using a pcr method].
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the presence of periodontopathic bacteria dna in the granulation tissue of periodontally involved gingival tissue. forty periodontitis patients were examined. subgingival plaque and saliva samples were collected from the patients before surgery. then, granulation tissue was also collected during surgery. another 20 patients, who had more than 4 mm in probing pocket depth, were also examined as a control. they received only initial treatment without periodontal surgery. plaque and saliva samples were also collected from them. seven periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, toreponema denticola, campylobacter rectus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens, were detected by a pcr method from these samples of all patients. as clinical parameters, probing pocket depth, clinical attachment level, and bleeding on probing were recorded. one year after surgery, sampling of subgingival plaque and saliva, and measurement of clinical parameters were performed on the patients. the dna of periodontopathic bacteria was detected in the granulation tissue of 29 out of 40 patients. p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, t. denticola, c. rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens were detected in 23, 11, 12, 9, 3, 2 and 1 subject(s) respectively. the sites with undetectable level of any periodontal pathogens at one year after surgery showed a clinical attachment  gain of 2.44 mm, while those that showed detectable pathogen levels had only a 0.77 mm gain. our results indicated that the removal of granulation tissue contributed to eliminating periodontal pathogens and to avoiding re-infection by  those bacteria. complete eradication of periodontopathic bacteria would be necessary for successful periodontal treatment.

AB  == background, aims: conventional mechanical treatment of papillon-lefevre syndrome  periodontitis has a poor prognosis. this report describes an effective antimicrobial treatment of rapidly progressing periodontitis in an 11-year old girl having papillon-lefevre syndrome. method: clinical examination included conventional periodontal measurements and radiographic analysis. occurrence of major suspected periodontopathic bacteria was determined by selective and non-selective culture and by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) identification. presence of cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr type 1 virus was determined by a nested-pcr detection method. therapy included scaling and root planing, oral hygiene instruction, and systemic amoxicillin-metronidazole therapy (250 mg of each/3 times daily/10 days) which, based on follow-up microbiological testing, was repeated after 4 months. supportive periodontal therapy took place at 2 visits during a 16-month period. results: at baseline, 10 of 22 available teeth demonstrated severe periodontal breakdown. at 16 months, probing and radiographic measurements revealed no teeth with additional attachment loss, and several teeth exhibited significant reduction in gingivitis and pocket depth, increase in radiographic alveolar bone height and clinical attachment level, and radiographic evidence of crestal lamina dura. baseline subgingival microbiota included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (3.4% of total isolates), prevotella nigrescens (16.4%), fusobacteriumnucleatum (14.3%) and peptostreptococcus micros  (10.6%), as well as cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr type 1 virus. at termination of the study, culture and pcr examinations showed absence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. micros and herpesviruses, and p. nigrescens and f.nucleatum each comprised less than 0.1 % of subgingival isolates. conclusion: this study suggests that controlling the periodontopathic microbiota by appropriate antibiotic and conventional periodontal therapy can arrest papillon-lefevre syndrome periodontitis.

TI  == periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood.
AB  == background: little information is available on periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood. we assessed the prevalence by age of 10 putative periodontopathic microorganisms in periodontally healthy children using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay. methods: plaque samples were collected from the buccal-mesial sulcus of the first molar or second primary molar in the right upper quadrant of 144 children (2 to 13 years old, 12 subjects from each year of age) who showed negligible periodontal inflammation. using species-specific primers of porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, and treponema denticola, pcr amplification was performed with bacterial genomic dna from plaque samples. results: the results indicated that c. rectus, e. corrodens, a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. ochracea, and c. sputigena were found in about 50% of the plaque samples from all age groups, while b. forsythus and p. intermedia were detected less frequently, and p. gingivalis and t. denticola were not found. in contrast, the percentage of p.  nigrescens-positive subjects increased with age in primary dentition, and reached about 50% at 7 years of age and older. subject-based analyses suggested that the  number of bacterial species in the plaque samples increased gradually with age until 5 years old, and then reached a plateau after the mixed dentition period. conclusions: the colonization of many putative periodontopathic microorganisms can occur quite early in childhood without clinical signs of periodontal disease. however, colonization by p. gingivalis and t. denticola was not detected in periodontally healthy children.

TI  == the localization of periodontal-disease-associated bacteria in human periodontal  pockets.
AB  == some gram-negative anaerobes are associated with the incidence and progression of periodontal disease. in periodontal pockets, however, the localization of those bacteria is unknown. we investigated the localization of 5 bacterial species in human periodontal pockets. fifteen teeth with a part of periodontal pockets from  10 adult periodontitis patients were obtained, and the localization of bacteria was examined immunohistochemically. positive reactions with anti-prevotella nigrescens antibody were located at the epithelium-associated plaque area in the  middle pocket zones. in the middle and deep pocket zones, fusobacterium nucleatum and treponema denticola were especially localized in the unattached plaque area,  but eikenella corrodens was observed in the tooth-attached plaque area. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, detected in 2 of 15 samples examined, was found in the unattached plaque area, in the middle pocket zone. the present findings indicated that the 5 bacterial species examined localized at distinct regions in human periodontal pockets.

TI  == efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (ii). effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == [clinical and microbiological study of adult periodontal disease].
AB  == the aim of this study was to carry out a microbiological evaluation of sites with and without clinical evidence of moderate and severe periodontitis and their correlation with clinical parameters. a total of 52 disease sites and 10 healthy  sites were selected according to clinical criteria. the following clinical indexes were measured for all the sites: plaque index, gingival index, blood on probing, depth on probing and insertion level. samples of subgingival plaque were collected for culture and for differential counts of microbial morphotypes. in disease sites the most frequently isolated were: prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (65%), porphyromonas gingivalis (23%), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (23%), fusobacterium nucleatum (10%) and peptostreptococcus sp. (31%). the aerobic gram-positive microflora was predominant in healthy sites. significant differences were observed in microbial morphotypes between healthy and disease sites: cocci 18.71% and 78.90%, motile rods 46.12% and 16.70%, total spirochetes  26.48% and 2.80%, respectively. the presence of motile rods, spirochetes and p. intermedia/nigrescens were the parameters with most sensitivity to suspect periodontal disease. there were significant differences in the subgingival microflora between healthy and disease sites in patients with moderate and severe periodontitis.

TI  == clinical periodontal findings and microflora profiles in children with chronic neutropenia under supervised oral hygiene.
AB  == background: this is the first known case report that used a polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based method to help identify the oral microflora in patients with chronic neutropenia. in this study, we report clinical periodontal findings and microflora profiles of 2 children, 1 with severe congenital neutropenia (scn, kostmann type) and 1 with cyclic neutropenia (cn). methods: the scn patient had severe gingivitis, whereas the patient with cn had mild gingivitis in the gingival margins. monthly oral cleaning instruction and review were performed without subsequent periodontal therapy. oral hygiene conditions remained satisfactory and visible plaque was scarce, despite the persistence of mild gingivitis. under supervised oral hygiene, we examined the presence of periodontal pathogens from patient plaque samples. results: by a pcr-based method, prevotella nigrescens, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, and capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in the scn patient and p. intermedia, c.  rectus, c. gingivalis, and c. sputigena in the cn patient, suggesting the existence of periodontal pathogens. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and c. ochracea were not found in  either patient. conclusions: use of 1% povidone iodine solution and local antibiotic application under supervised oral hygiene were helpful to improve gingival conditions in patients with chronic neutropenia.

AB  == a 16s rdna-directed polymerase chain reaction method was used to assess the occurrence of four black-pigmented anaerobic rods, treponema denticola, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in acute periradicular abscesses. pus was collected by aspiration from 10 cases diagnosed as acute abscesses of endodontic  origin. dna was extracted from the samples and analyzed using a polymerase chain  reaction-based identification assay. the method allowed detecting black-pigmented anaerobes in 80% of the examined abscesses. porphyromonas endodontalis was found  in 70%, t. denticola in 50%, porphyromonas gingivalis in 40%, and prevotella intermedia in 10% of the cases. p. gingivalis was always found associated with p. endodontalis. prevotella nigrescens and a. actinomycetemcomitans were not found in any pus sample. the high prevalence of p. endodontalis, t. denticola, and p. gingivalis suggests that they can play an important role in the etiology of acute periradicular abscesses.

TI  == on the symmetry of periodontal disease.
AB  == background/aim: symmetry is a common feature of biological systems, and can be observed in multiple aspects of the human body. the purpose of this study was to  estimate the impact of symmetry on variance observed in intraoral topographic distribution patterns of chronic periodontitis. method: this analysis was performed on a data set from 56 subjects, including clinical and microbiological  variables, recorded at the mesial and distal aspect of every tooth in the entire  dentition. the impact of contralateral conditions was determined on the level of  the site, the tooth, and the quadrant. results: significant correlations were detected between probing depths, recession, attachment levels, total cultivable bacterial counts and the plaque index recorded on the right and left side on all  levels of analysis. the odds for bleeding on sampling, as well as for the presence of p. intermedia/nigrescens and a. actinomycetemcomitans increased significantly if the respective contralateral site was positive for the same parameter. in combining ipsilateral and contralateral parameters into the analysis it could be shown in several instances that this contralateral effect was stronger than the impact of other, ipsilateral factors. as an example, the odds for bleeding on sampling increased up to 10 fold if the contralateral site was bleeding, whereas the ipsilateral total cultivable count, determined at the same site, explained less than 30% of the variation in the bleeding tendency. conclusion: these findings support the view that the development of periodontal disease in any site cannot be explained by the influence of local detrimental factors alone.

TI  == smoking affects the subgingival microflora in periodontitis.
AB  == background: tobacco smoking has been identified as one major risk factor for destructive periodontal disease. scaling and root planing have been shown to be less effective in smokers with periodontitis. the aim of the present study was to compare the subgingival microbial flora of treated and untreated smokers and non-smokers. methods: four independent adult patient groups with periodontitis were included in this investigation: 88 untreated smokers (u-s); 90 untreated non-smokers (u-ns); 119 treated non-smokers (t-ns); and 171 treated smokers (t-s). clinical variables included cumulative plaque index (cpi), probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), cumulative bleeding index (cbi), and cumulative suppuration index (csi). paper point samples from the deepest bleeding pocket in each quadrant of the dentition were analyzed for the presence and levels of 6 periodontal bacterial pathogens using anaerobic culture techniques. results: u-s showed a higher mean cumulative plaque index than u-ns (3.5 versus 2.7). mean pd and mean cal were higher in the t-s in comparison to the t-ns group (7.0 versus 6.6 mm and 5.6 versus 4.7 mm, respectively). microbiological characteristics of u-s were a higher prevalence of prevotella intermedia/nigrescens and higher mean levels of peptostreptococcus micros (pm) and fusobacterium nucleatum (fn). t-s patients were characterized by higher prevalence of bacteroides forsythus (bf), pm, and campylobacter rectus (cr) and higher mean levels of pm and fn. the mean percentage of b. forsythus tended to be higher in the t-s group than in the t-ns group (6.9% versus 5.6%). the relative risk to be infected with bf, pm, and cr was statistically higher in smokers (odds ratios: 1.9, 1.9, and 1.6, respectively). the chance to find > or =10% of bf, pm, and/or fn was 3.3 higher in smokers when a. actinomycetemcomitans and p gingivalis were absent. detection of > or =20% pm/fn in treated patients was strongly associated with smoking (odds ratio 13.8, p= 0.002). conclusions: smoking is a determining factor for the composition of the subgingival microflora in adult patients with periodontitis and may select for a specific cluster of periodontal pathogens, notably bf, pm, fn, and cr. on the basis of these observations, smoking, among other criteria, may be one parameter to use in deciding to treat refractory periodontitis in smokers with a systemic antibiotic  therapy directed against smoking-associated periodontal bacteria.

AB  == in the western world, the policy of deinstitutionalization and integration of individuals with mental retardation is generally accepted. we tested the hypothesis that de-institutionalization may lead to changes of habits with a potential to influence oral health. when 57 adults with mental retardation moved  from an institution to community-based living, their oral hygiene habits, gingival bleeding, and a three-day food record were registered one month before and 9 and 21 months after the move. mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in saliva, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, p. gingivalis, and a. actinomycetemcomitans  in supragingival plaque, and c. albicans on mucous membranes were analyzed. after 21 months of community-based living, fewer persons showed high classes of mutans  streptococci, growth of p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, and high frequency of sucrose intake, and more subjects showed growth of c. albicans. in a short perspective, the indicators of oral diseases suggest an unchanged or lower risk of oral diseases after the de-institutionalization of individuals with moderate or severe mental retardation.

TI  == a microbiological study of papillon-lefevre syndrome in two patients.
AB  == aim: to analyse the microflora of subgingival plaque from patients with papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls), which is a very rare disease characterised by palmar-plantar hyperkeratosis with precocious periodontal destruction. methods: bacterial isolates were identified using a combination of commercial identification kits, traditional laboratory tests, and gas liquid chromatography. some isolates were also subjected to partial 16s rdna sequencing. plaque samples  were also assayed for the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in a quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) using monoclonal antibodies. results: the culture results showed that most isolates were capnophilic and facultatively anaerobic species-mainly capnocytophaga spp and streptococcus spp. the latter included s. constellatus, s. oralis, and s. sanguis. other facultative bacteria belonged to the genera gemella, kingella, leuconostoc, and stomatococcus. the aerobic bacteria isolated were species of neisseria and bacillus. anaerobic species included prevotella intermedia, p. melaninogenica, and p. nigrescens, as  well as peptostreptococcus spp. elisa detected p gingivalis in one patient in all sites sampled, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only one site from the other patient. prevotella intermedia was present in low numbers. conclusions: patients with pls have a very complex subgingival flora including recognised periodontal pathogens. however, no particular periodontopathogen is invariably associated with pls.

TI  == relationship of periodontopathic bacteria with early-onset periodontitis in down's syndrome.
AB  == background: down's syndrome (ds) patients often develop severe early-onset marginal periodontitis in early adulthood; however, there is little information available on the microbiology of ds periodontitis. methods: subgingival plaque specimens were taken from 67 ds young adults and 41 age-matched systemically healthy individuals with mental disabilities (md). the prevalence of 10 possible  periodontopathic bacterial species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola, prevotella  intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were investigated in their subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction method. the detection of p. gingivalis fima genotypes was also performed in p. gingivalis-positive samples. results: although ds subjects generally develop an earlier and more extensive periodontal breakdown than those with md, no significant differences were observed in the bacterial profiles. the profiles of  subjects with periodontitis were significant in ds, but not in md. the prevalence of p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and p. intermedia were significant in the ds periodontitis group, compared to ds gingivitis group. moreover, the occurrence of p. gingivalis with the type ii fima gene was significantly related to periodontitis in both ds and md, with odds ratios of 6.32 and 12.03, respectively. conclusions: these results suggest that early-onset periodontitis in ds is mainly due to the more susceptible host for the causative microbial agents including p. gingivalis with type ii fima.

TI  == smoking and subgingival microflora in periodontal disease.
AB  == aim: the present investigation was undertaken to analyze the influence of smoking on the periodontal disease associated subgingival microflora. the population included 33 smokers and 31 non-smokers in the age range 36-86 years. methods: microbial samples were obtained from 4 sites per patient. the checker-board dna-dna hybridization technology was used for detection of the bacterial species  p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, b. forsythus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, t. denticola, p. micros, c. rectus, e. corrodens, s. noxia and s. intermedius. results: using score 1 as cutoff, contrasting colonized versus non-colonized patients, 8 out of 12 species were detected in > or = 90% of both smokers and non-smokers. using score 4 as cutoff,  contrasting heavily colonized patients versus non-colonized and less heavily colonized patients, the detection rates decreased in both smokers and non-smokers. no significant differences in detection rates were observed between  smokers and non-smokers. logistic regression analysis indicated that neither smoking, probing depth nor gingival bleeding influenced the occurrence of the species analyzed. the lack of a smoking exposure dose-response further supported  the indication of a limited influence of smoking. conclusion: smoking exerts little, if any, influence on the subgingival occurrence of several of the bacteria most commonly associated with periodontal disease.

TI  == studies on oral health in mentally retarded adults.
AB  == during the last decades, a new policy involving normalisation, integration, equality and deinstitutionalisation of mentally retarded (mr) individuals has been accepted in sweden. consequently, many institutions have been closed and an  increased number of people with mr are now integrated into the swedish community. the general aim of this thesis was to investigate if a greater degree of independence for mr adults influenced the prevalence of oral diseases. material and methods: the caries incidence and prevalence, number of remaining teeth, incidence of tooth mortality and interproximal bone loss were investigated in a group of mr adults, aged 21-40 years, all with protracted, regular preventive dental care. the studied variables were related to living arrangements and degree of mr, and were followed during 8.5 years (papers i, ii and vi). incidence and reasons for tooth mortality were studied during 10 years in institutionalised mr  individuals (paper iii). in connection with the closing-down of an institution for mr adults, the changes of oral hygiene habits, sucrose intake and oral microbiological flora were studied in the new integrated living (papers iv and v). results: less restrictive living arrangements and mild forms of mr were correlated to a high caries prevalence in persons with mr. after 8.5 years, the caries incidence had decreased in all subjects, but persons with mild mr and those who lived integrated still had a higher caries prevalence than other mr adults. with the exception of subjects with down syndrome, the interproximal bone loss during 8.5 years was similar or lower compared to normal swedish populations. institutionalised mr subjects had lost an average of 3.72 teeth during 10 years. periodontitis was the main reason for tooth mortality. persons who cooperated well with dental treatment and those who used neuroleptics lost fewer teeth during the 10-year period compared to other mr individuals. the proportion of subjects with high levels of mutans streptococci and subjects who showed growth of p. intermedia/p. nigrescens decreased after deinstitutionalisation, and less subjects consumed sucrose frequently. the oral hygiene routines, and the levels of lactobacilli, p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans were not influenced by the change in living arrangements. a simplified saliva sampling method, involving licking directly on the bacteria culture, was developed to count lactobacilli in saliva when delivering whole saliva was impossible. conclusions: less restrictive living and a mild degree of  mr were correlated to a high caries prevalence. subjects with poor ability to cooperate with dental treatment and those with down syndrome have an obvious risk of deteriorated oral health. however, compared to normal swedish populations, the mr subjects studied in this thesis had, after several years of regular dental care, satisfactory oral health.

TI  == inhibition of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxicity by bacteria from the subgingival flora.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans produces a pore-forming leukotoxin that lyses human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes. certain proteolytic bacteria may coexist with a. actinomycetemcomitans in periodontal pockets. we aimed therefore to examine whether oral bacteria can modify the leukotoxicity of  a. actinomycetemcomitans. a total of 55 strains representing 45 bacterial species of the subgingival flora were tested. each strain was incubated with the highly toxic strain of a. actinomycetemcomitans hk 1519 and the leukotoxic activity of the suspension against human polymorphonuclear leukocytes was determined from the activity of the lactate dehydrogenase released upon lysis of the leukocytes. porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica and prevotella loeschii inhibited the leukotoxicity of  a. actinomycetemcomitans cells as well as the activity of leukotoxin purified from the same strain. the bacterial strains without the ability to block leukotoxic activity also failed to destroy pure leukotoxin even after 5 h of incubation. the proteolytic degradation of leukotoxin by p. gingivalis was mainly dependent on the activity of the enzymes r- and k-gingipains. p. intermedia and p. nigrescens also degraded the leukotoxin by enzymes. the results imply a role of the periodontal microflora in modifying the virulence of a. actinomycetemcomitans by destroying its leukotoxin.

TI  == microbial composition of supra- and subgingival plaque in subjects with adult periodontitis.
AB  == background, aims: the purpose of the present study was to compare and relate the  microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51 +/- 14 years). methods: a total of 1,170 samples of supra and subgingival plaque were collected from the mesial aspect of every tooth (up to 28 supra and 28 subgingival samples) from each subject and evaluated for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level,  were made at 6 sites per tooth. the counts (levels), % dna probe count (proportion) and % of sites colonized (prevalence) of each species in supra and separately in subgingival plaque were computed for each subject. significance of  differences between supra and subgingival plaque for each species was sought using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: all 40 taxa were detected in both supra and subgingival plaque. actinomyces species were the most prevalent taxa in both habitats. 75 to 100% of  supra and 62 to 100% of subgingival sites were colonized by at least one of the 5 actinomyces species. supragingival samples exhibited significantly higher counts  of actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, neisseria mucosa, streptococcus gordonii, capnocytophaga ochracea  and capnocytophaga sputigena when compared with mean counts in subgingival samples taken from the same tooth surfaces. subgingival plaque samples presented  significantly higher counts of prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus and porphykromonas gingivalis. subgingival samples exhibited a significantly higher proportion of "red" and "orange complex" species, while supragingival plaque exhibited higher proportions of "green" and "purple" complex species as well as actinomyces species. suspected periodontal pathogens could be detected in supragingival plaque from sites where subgingival  samples were negative for the same species. conclusions: the data indicate that supragingival plaque can harbor putative periodontal pathogens, suggesting a possible role of this environment as a reservoir of such species for the spread or reinfection of subgingival sites.

TI  == coptidis rhizoma inhibits growth and proteases of oral bacteria.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial effect of coptidis rhizoma (cr), a traditional medicinal plant, on oral bacteria. materials and methods: cr extract was prepared by boiling cr in water for 2 h. alkaloids contained in cr extract were assayed by high performance liquid chromatography (hplc). antibacterial activity of cr extract was estimated from the lowest concentration that did not permit bacterial growth (minimum inhibitory concentration, mic) and the concentrations that inhibited 50% of bacterial proteolytic activity (ic50). results: cr extract inhibited the growth of actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans at mic of 0.031-0.25 mg ml(-1), whereas it had less inhibitory effect (mic: 0.5-2 mg ml(-1)) on the growth of streptococcus and lactobacillus. the major active component of cr extract was berberine (ber), an alkaloid, and its inhibiting specificity to bacterial growth was similar to that of cr extract. cr extract and ber were bacteriostatic at the mics against most of the bacteria, and bacteriocidal at the concentrations higher than the mics. ber inhibited the activities of collagenase from p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusion: cr extract and ber had an inhibitory effect on periodontopathogenic bacteria. these results suggest the possibility of their clinical application for the treatment of periodontal diseases.

TI  == identification of periodontal disease-associated bacteria in the "plaque-free zone".
AB  == background: subgingival plaque bacteria live within a biofilm covered with glycocalyx, and little is known of the bacterial species associated with biofilm  formation at the bottom of human periodontal pockets, the so-called "plaque-free  zone"(pfz). methods: seventy-seven extracted teeth from 56 patients with severe advanced adult periodontitis were examined. porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, prevotella nigrescens, and actinomyces viscosus were examined by scanning immunoelectron microscopic techniques, using both secondary and back-scattered imaging, with rabbit antibodies specific for each bacteria. results: secondary electron images showed  that rods, filaments, and spirochete-shaped bacteria formed small aggregates in the pfz. some of the bacteria were covered with an amorphous film-like structure. by back-scattered electron imaging, positive reactions with anti-p. gingivalis were found in 8 of 13 samples examined, and film-like structures coated several cells of 6 positive samples examined. labeled cells with anti-c. rectus, anti-t.  denticola and anti-p. nigrescens were detected in 3 of 11, 5 of 10, and 1 of 8 samples examined. a. viscosus were found in 6 of 11 of the samples. a. viscosus tended to overlay the amorphous capsula and aggregate. f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans were not detected in any samples examined. conclusions: these findings indicated that p. gingivalis, c. rectus, t. denticola, p. nigrescens, and a. viscosus were present in the pfz, and that some specified bacteria were possibly related to plaque-biofilm formation of subgingival plaque.

TI  == "checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  == background: we explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum igg responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. methods: one hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients  aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject;  2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic dna probes. serum igg antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. results: cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of eikenella corrodens, veillonella  parvula, and actinomyces naeslundii in controls. cases displayed higher igg levels against p. gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against f. nucleatum, t. denticola, e. nodatum,  and capnocytophaga ochracea. positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. in cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species  out of which only one was positive (v. parvula). both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. a logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. conclusion: a combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.

TI  == periodontopathic bacteria in children with down syndrome.
AB  == background: it is widely known that individuals with down syndrome (ds) often develop severe early-onset periodontal diseases. in this study, we examined the prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in ds children to determine if specific pathogens are acquired in their childhood. methods: the subjects were 60 ds children (2 to 13 years old, 5 in each age bracket) and 60 age-matched controls.  ten pathogens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, p nigrescens,  capnocytophaga ochracea, c. sputigena, campyrobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens were surveyed in subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction. periodontal status was evaluated by probing depth, bleeding on probing, and gingival index. results: no significant difference in periodontal status was  observed between the ds and control groups, however, all of the pathogens were detected with greater frequency in the ds children. b. forsythus, t. denticola, p. nigrescens, and c. rectus were significantly prevalent throughout all age brackets of the ds children (p <0.01 or 0.05). the occurrence of p. gingivalis was also significant in the ds subjects over 5 years old. a cluster analysis of the microbial profiles of the ds subjects showed that gingivitis severity was associated with increased varieties of the harboring pathogens and the distribution of p. gingivalis. conclusions: these results suggest that various periodontopathogens can colonize in the very early childhood of ds patients and maturation of subgingival components, including p. gingivalis, plays an important role in the initiation of gingival inflammation.

TI  == persistence patterns of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, and actinobacillus actinomyetemcomitans after mechanical therapy of periodontal disease.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to determine the distribution patterns of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in periodontitis patients after standard mechanical periodontal therapy, and to determine factors increasing the odds to detect these target organisms in treated sites. methods: eight hundred fifty-two (852) separate subgingival microbial samples were taken from the mesial and distal aspects of every tooth in 17 patients. target organisms were identified culturally. results: the 3 microorganisms showed different persistence patterns:  p. gingivalis was detected in a high percentage of subjects (59%), but in a low proportion of sites (5.4%). p. intermedia/nigrescens was detected in all subjects except one, and in 40.6% of the tested sites. only 5 subjects were a. actinomycetemcomitans positive, but 2 of them showed a very high number of positive sites (44% and 75%, respectively). a highly significant relationship was found between a subject's tendency to bleed upon sampling and the number of p. intermedia/nigrescens-positive sites. a significant portion of the variation in frequency of persisting p. gingivalis could be explained by the frequency of persisting pockets deeper than 4 mm. no similar relationship could be established between clinical parameters and a. actinomycetemcomitans. on a site level, the odds of detecting p. gingivalis increased by a factor of 2.47 (p= 0.0001) for every millimeter of residual probing depth; the odds of detecting p. intermedia/nigrescens increased by a factor of 1.84 (p= 0.0001). conclusions: if, after standard mechanical periodontal therapy, a large number of sites continue to bleed, one may expect an increased number of sites positive for p. intermedia/ nigrescens. if many deep pockets persist, a greater number of p. gingivalis-positive sites can be expected.

TI  == microbial findings at failing implants.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate qualitative differences in the subgingival  microbiota at titanium implants, ad modum branemark, demonstrating clinical and radiographic signs of loss of supporting tissues (peri-implantitis) as compared to implants surrounded by healthy tissues. a total of 37 patients demonstrating 1 or more implants with bone loss > or = 3 threads, bleeding on probing and/or suppuration and 51 patients with clinically healthy mucosa and no bone loss were  recruited for the study. in each patient subgingival bacterial samples were obtained using paper-points, and subjected to microbiological analysis by culture. the two types of clinical conditions showed distinct bacterial profiles. for implants with peri-implantitis putative periodontal pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, were found in 60% of the cases and microorganisms primarily not associated with periodontitis, such as staphylococcus spp., enterics and candida spp., were found in 55% of the peri-imaplant lesions. in contrast, implants surrounded by healthy tissue demonstrated a microbiota associated with periodontal health. the results indicate that the microbiota of the healthy peri-implant sulci is similar to that from corresponding conditions around teeth. however, in peri-implant areas staphylococci, enterics and yeasts were found almost as frequently as periopathogens indicating differences as compared to the microbiota around periodontitis affected teeth. a microbiological diagnosis may therefore be of guidance for the choice of antimicrobial treatment in patients with peri-implant  infection.

TI  == microbiological features of papillon-lefevre syndrome periodontitis.
AB  == papillon-lefevre syndrome patients exhibit hyperkeratosis palmo-plantaris and severe periodontitis. the syndrome is an autosomal recessive trait, but the mechanism of periodontal destruction is not known. this report presents the clinical and microbiological features of an 11-year old girl with papillon-lefevre syndrome. clinical examination included conventional periodontal measurements and radiographic analysis. in samples from 3 deep periodontal lesions, the occurrence of major suspected periodontopathic bacteria was determined by selective and non-selective culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) identification, and the presence of cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr type 1 virus by a nested-pcr detection method. 10 of 22 available teeth demonstrated severe periodontal breakdown. major cultivable bacteria included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (3.4% of total isolates), prevotella nigrescens (16.4%), fusobacterium nucleatum (14.3%) and peptostreptococcus micros (10.6%). a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis and eikenella corrodens were identified by pcr analysis. the patient's non-affected parents and older brother revealed several periodontal pathogens but not a. actinomycetemcomitans. the viral examination demonstrated cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr type 1 virus in the subgingival sample of the papillon-lefevre syndrome patient. the father and brother yielded subgingival cytomegalovirus but  not epstein-barr type 1 virus. we hypothesize that human herpesviruses in concert with a. actinomycetemcomitans play important roles in the development of papillon-lefevre syndrome periodontitis.

TI  == periodontitis associated bacteria in supragingival plaque of dental hygienists: stability of carrier state and clinical development.
AB  == the purpose of this study was the clinical and microbiological re-examination of  dental hygienists, who, 30 months before, had shown remarkably high supragingival levels of periodontitis-associated micro-organisms. interdental plaque was collected from the same molar sites and investigated by the same immunofluorescence assay with taxa-specific monoclonal antibodies as at the initial examination. on average, the 15 re-examined subjects showed slightly increased plaque levels but unchanged bleeding on probing scores (0.3-1.4). pocket formation was restricted to a single subject. prevotella intermedia/p. nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros were present in every plaque sample. prevalences of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus and campylobacter rectus were again between 20-40%, but some fluctuation within subjects was noted. the data confirm supragingival plaque as a natural habitat for periodontitis-associated bacteria in periodontially healthy persons, and indicate that colonization with a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. forsythus or c. rectus is mostly stable in spite of better than average personal plaque control.

TI  == relationship between herpesviruses and adult periodontitis and periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == background: various mammalian viruses and specific bacteria seem to play important roles in the pathogenesis of human periodontitis. this study examined the relationship between subgingival herpesviruses and periodontal disease and potential periodontopathic bacteria in 140 adults exhibiting either periodontitis or gingivitis. methods: a nested-polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method determined the presence of epstein-barr virus type 1 and type 2 (ebv-1, ebv-2), human cytomegalovirus (hcmv), and herpes simplex virus (hsv) and a 16s rrna pcr detection method identified actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens,  and treponema denticola. results: using a logistic analysis, ebv-1 showed significant positive association with p. gingivalis (odds ratio [or] 3.37), and with coinfections of p. gingivalis and p. intermedia (or 4.03); p. gingivalis and b. forsythus (or 3.84); p. gingivalis and t. denticola (or 4.17); p. gingivalis,  b. forsythus, and t. denticola (or 4.06); and p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, and t. denticola (or 3.29). ebv-1 also showed positive association with severe periodontitis (or 5.09), with increasing age (or 1.03), and with periodontal probing depth at the sample sites (or 1.77). hcmv was positively associated with  coinfections of p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens (or 3.23); p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and p. nigrescens (or 3.23); and p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, and t.  denticola (or 2.59); with severe periodontitis (or 4.65); and with age (or 1.03). patients with mixed viral infections revealed significant associations with p. gingivalis (or 2.27), and with coinfections of p. gingivalis and b. forsythus (or 2.06); p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens (or 2.91); p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and p. nigrescens (or 2.91); and p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, and t. denticola (or 2.70) with the clinical diagnosis of slight (or 3.73), moderate (or 3.82), or severe periodontitis (or 4.36), and with probing depth at the sample sites (or 1.39). hsv and ebv-2 showed no significant associations with any of the variables tested. conclusions: the results indicate that subgingival ebv-1, hcmv, and viral coinfections are associated with the subgingival presence of some periodontal pathogens and periodontitis. herpesviruses may exert periodontopathic potential by decreasing the host resistance against subgingival colonization and multiplication of periodontal pathogens.

TI  == comparative microbiological characteristics of failing implants and periodontally diseased teeth.
AB  == background: the purpose of this report was to compare the distribution of periodontal pathogens recovered from failing implants and teeth with adult and recurrent forms of periodontitis. methods: a total of 41 consecutive microbial samples from patients with failing implants (imp) were received at the microbiology testing laboratory (mtl) of the university of pennsylvania over a 2-year period. paired control samples were selected from samples received concurrently by mtl from 41 patients with a diagnosis of adult periodontitis (ap) and 41 with a diagnosis of recurrent or refractory periodontitis (rp). patients'  mean ages for the 3 categories were 59, 47, and 53 years, respectively. samples were collected with paper points or scalers and shipped in prereduced medium by express mail to the laboratory where they were processed within 48 hours from the time of collection. culture was used for detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, p. intermedia/nigrescens, e. corrodens, p. micros, capnocytophaga and  fusobacterium sp., enteric gram-negative rods, enterococcus and staphylococcus sp., and yeast. p. gingivalis and b. forsythus were detected by indirect immunofluorescence. morphotypes were enumerated by dark-field microscopy. results: the most frequently detected microorganisms from imp were b. forsythus (59%), spirochetes (54%), fusobacterium (41%), p. micros (39%), and p. gingivalis (27%). recovery levels (mean +/- sd) were 1+/-1, 4+/-5, 4+/-5, 9+/-11, 1+/-2, respectively. the most frequently detected organisms for ap were b. forsythus (83%), fusobacterium (80%), spirochetes (79%), p. gingivalis (59%), p. micros (51%), and e. corrodens (37%), at levels 2+/-2, 5+/-4, 9+/-6, 4+/-5, and 6+/-7, respectively. corresponding data for rp were b. forsythus (85%), fusobacterium (83%), p. gingivalis (60%), spirochetes (59%), c. rectus (56%), and p. micros (56%), at levels of 3+/-2, 8+/-8, 4+/-4, 2+/-2, 1+/-1, and 9+/-10, respectively.  conclusions: these results indicate that the detection frequency and levels of recovery of some periodontal pathogens in failing implants are significantly different from that of teeth with periodontitis; however, the detection frequency and levels of recovery are similar in teeth affected by adult and refractory (recurrent) forms of periodontitis.

AB  == the risk for harboring 6 putative periodontal pathogens in 4 selected periodontal pockets, in whole saliva, or in either site (i.e., orally) was determined in 52 caucasians, 49 african-americans, 48 asian-americans, and 50 hispanics living in  los angeles. 16s rrna pcr analysis assessed the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola. step-wise  regression analysis determined the relationship between the occurrence of each organism and various explanatory variables (risk indicators). periodontal probing depth or disease severity was positively associated with all 6 study organisms. african-americans carried an increased risk for harboring p. gingivalis in saliva (odds ratio [or] 2.95) and orally (or 2.66), and a reduced risk for harboring t.  denticola orally (or 0.34). asian-americans showed an increased risk for harboring a. actinomycetemcomitans in periodontal pockets (or 6.63) and p. gingivalis in periodontal pockets (or 5.39), in saliva (or 5.74), and orally (or  5.81). hispanics demonstrated an increased risk for harboring a. actinomycetemcomitans in periodontal pockets (or 12.27) and p. gingivalis in periodontal pockets (or 6.07), in saliva (or 8.72), and orally (or 7.98). age was positively associated with the prevalence of p. gingivalis in saliva (or 1.20) and orally (or 1.20), and of a. actinomycetemcomitans orally (or 1.18). the male  gender was a risk factor for harboring p. intermedia in periodontal pockets (or 2.40), in saliva (or 3.31), and orally (or 4.25), and for harboring p. nigrescens in saliva (or 2.85). the longer the subjects resided in the united states, the less likely a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected orally (or 0.82). former smokers demonstrated a decreased risk for harboring a. actinomycetemcomitans in saliva (or 0.23). current smokers displayed an increased risk for harboring t. denticola in periodontal pockets (or 4.61). the number of dental visits in the past 10 years was inversely related to the prevalence of p. intermedia orally (or 0.96). the prevalence of p. intermedia in saliva was positively associated with the length of time from the last dental visit (or 1.01). this study suggests that genetic and/or environmental factors predispose subjects to oral colonization by  putative periodontal pathogens.

TI  == subgingival microbial profile of papillon-lefevre patients assessed by dna-probes.
AB  == the prevalence of 18 selected bacterial species was assessed by means of "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridisation in a group of 12 saudi-arabian adolescents with papillon-lefevre syndrome. a total of 36 tooth sites were investigated. the  patients exhibited severe periodontal disease with deep pockets. all 12 patients  harboured the putative bacterial pathogens p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, p. micros and s. intermedius while t. denticola, b. forsythus, p. nigrescens, e. corrodens, s. noxia and c. rectus were recovered from 11 patients. p. gingivalis was recovered from 9 patients and 18 sites while corresponding figures for a. actinomycetemcomitans were 8 and 19, respectively. a number of the investigated species (b. forsythus, t. denticola, p. intermedia, c rectus) reached high levels (> or =10(6) cells) in more than 1/2 of the patients. on the other hand, bacteria such as a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were infrequently encountered  at high levels in these subgingival samples. in conclusion, the analysis failed to demonstrate a pls-specific profile of the subgingival infection, since the bacterial composition of the sampled sites closely resembled that characterising  deep pockets in adult periodontitis patients.

TI  == the utility of whole saliva to detect the oral presence of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == this study compared the presence of 6 periodontopathic bacteria in whole saliva and subgingival plaque of 202 subjects. the test bacteria were identified using a 16s rrna-based pcr detection method. each study subject contributed a whole saliva sample and a paper point sample pooled from the deepest periodontal pocket in each quadrant of the dentition. the kappa test revealed a fair agreement between the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola in whole saliva and periodontal pocket samples (kappa > 0.4). the mcnemar test showed that the differences between sample types were due to a more frequent detection of the 3 organisms in whole saliva than in periodontal pocket samples (p < 0.01). prevotella nigrescens also was detected more frequently in whole saliva than in periodontal pocket samples (p < 0.01; mcnemar  test). although little agreement between samples was found for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus (kappa < or = 0.4), neither whole saliva nor pocket samples showed better detection for these 2 species (p < 0.01,  mcnemar test). the results indicate that whole saliva is superior to pooled periodontal pocket samples to detect p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, and t. denticola in the oral cavity. the detection of oral a. actinomycetemcomitans and b. forsythus with reasonably good accuracy may require  both whole saliva and periodontal pocket samples.

TI  == supernatant cytotoxicity and proteolytic activity of selected oral bacteria against human gingival fibroblasts in vitro.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine if endodontic bacterial act in vitro on human gingival fibroblast functions via extracellular products. the bacteria used were prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga ochracea, peptostreptoccocus micros and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. supernatants were collected from bacterial cultures at the beginning of the stationary phase when their density was similar. toxins that inhibited fibroblast proliferation were found in all culture supernatants of gram-positive or gram-negative bacterial strains, except  for prev. nigrescens. the cytotoxicity of a. actinomycetemcomitans supernatant was about 1000 fold higher than the others. this supernatant diluted to 1/1000 led to total fibroblast growth inhibition whereas only 25% growth inhibition was  obtained with capn. ochracea and pept. micros diluted to 1/10. bacterial supernatant proteolytic activity was investigated in confluent fibroblast cultures that were incubated for 48 hr with each of the supernatants diluted to 1/2 except for a. actinomycetemcomitans supernatant diluted to 1/20. indirect immunofluorescence studies of extracellular-matrix molecules, followed by immunoelectrophoretic analysis of extracts of whole-cell layers, demonstrated that only conditioned medium of prev. nigrescens had a proteolytic activity capable of degrading the greater part of type i collagen and fibronectin fibres in the extracellular matrix.

TI  == the clinical and microbiological effects of non-surgical periodontal therapy in smokers and non-smokers.
AB  == 28 patients, 13 smokers and 15 non-smokers with untreated advanced periodontal disease, were subjected to a series of oral hygiene instructions and treated with non-surgical periodontal therapy. baseline values regarding clinical data did not differ significantly between the groups. 6 months following therapy the full-mouth bleeding score among smokers was 36.5% as compared to 22.7% for non-smokers (p < 0.05). probing depth was reduced by 1.9 mm for smokers and by 2.5 mm for non-smokers. this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). the level of p. gingivalis and p. intermedia/nigrescens was reduced in both groups as compared to baseline. a. actinonmycetemcomitans, however demonstrated a slight increase in mean values at 6 months. this was especially notable for smokers in which a. actinomycetemcomitans were more difficult to eradicate. conclusively, the microbiological response found in this study seems to be in conformity with the clinical response with little influence of the smoking habits.

TI  == salivary iga responses to bacteria in dental plaque as related to periodontal and hiv infection status.
AB  == levels of total iga and specific iga reactive with streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum were measured by elisa in parotid saliva from hiv+ and hiv- persons with healthy gingiva (hg), chronic gingivitis, chronic marginal periodontitis (cmp), or necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (nup). when the hiv+ group was compared with the hiv- group regardless of periodontal status, total salivary iga concentration was higher in hiv+ patients, but no such difference was observed for total iga output. hiv+ cmp displayed higher total iga concentration as compared with hiv- cmp. no significant differences in specific iga outputs and ratios were detected  between hiv+ and hiv- subgroups with similar periodontal status. hiv+ nup displayed increased specific iga output towards s. mutans and increased specific  iga ratio values towards s. mutans, p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens as compared with hiv+ cmp, and increased specific iga ratio values towards s. mutans and p. nigrescens as compared with hiv+ hg. no such differences were observed between the hiv- subgroups. in sum, salivary iga responses to bacteria in dental plaque seem not to be related to chronic periodontal disease and hiv infection, but are  possibly influenced by acute periodontal infection.

TI  == oral food consumption and subgingival microorganisms: subgingival microbiota of gastrostomy tube-fed children and healthy controls.
AB  == this study examined the effect of oral food consumption on the prevalence and levels of subgingival bacteria and yeasts in 20 gastrostomy tube-fed children and 24 healthy controls. microbial identification was carried out using anaerobic culture and 16s rrna-based pcr identification methods. streptococcal and actinomyces species were recovered from 100% and 76% of all subjects and averaged 66% and 11% of total cultivable organisms, respectively. in decreasing order of prevalence, fusobacterium, enteric rods, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga, propionibacterium, yeasts, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, and porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in 48% to 2% of the study subjects. the cultivable levels of these species varied widely among subjects. pcr detection showed c. rectus and eikenella corrodens both to occur in 93% of the study subjects and to be the most prevalent putative periodontal pathogens examined. in decreasing order of prevalence, pcr identified treponema denticola, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. nigrescens, p. intermedia, b. forsythus,  and p. gingivalis in 38% to 21% of the subjects studied. tube-fed children and healthy controls exhibited similar subgingival microbial compositions. it appears from this study that oral food consumption is not a major determinant for the establishment of subgingival microbiota in children.

TI  == periodontitis patient and the spouse: periodontal bacteria before and after treatment.
AB  == suspected periodontal pathogens can be transmitted between spouses. the treatment response may be unsuccessful in periodontitis patients, if the spouse harbors these bacteria. the aim of the present 6-month follow-up study was to clarify whether the microbiological treatment outcome of periodontitis patients is related to the detection of suspected periodontal pathogens in the saliva of the  spouse. 10 patients with advanced periodontitis and their spouses were included in the study. the patients received mechanical periodontal treatment and 500 mg metronidazole systemically 2x a day for 7 days. the presence of visible plaque, gingival bleeding after probing, suppuration, supragingival and subgingival calculus and pocket depths were assessed at baseline and 1 and 6 months after treatment. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus and peptostreptococcus micros were cultured from pooled subgingival samples from the  patients and from salivary samples from the spouses at corresponding occasions. periodontal conditions in the patients improved after treatment as determined by  the significantly lower values of clinical variables 1 and 6 months after treatment compared to those at baseline. however, the re-emergence of periodontal bacteria after treatment of the patients was not related to the concurrent detection of the respective bacteria in the saliva of the spouses. in this study  design, it seemed that the salivary bacterial load in the spouse was of minor importance for the microbiological treatment outcome of the patient.

TI  == reduced serum igg reactivities with bacteria from dental plaque in hiv-infected persons with periodontitis.
AB  == serum samples were obtained from 44 hiv-seropositive (hiv+) and 37 hiv-seronegative (hiv-) persons that were grouped according to periodontal status. serum igg and iga reactivities towards streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis. prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum were measured by means of elisa. hiv+ persons with chronic marginal periodontitis showed significantly lower igg reactivities to the periodontal pathogens a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum as compared  with their hiv- counterparts (p < 0.05). specific serum iga reactivities were similar in the two periodontitis groups, except for p. nigrescens where the hiv+  group with chronic marginal periodontitis had lower values than their systemically healthy counterparts (p < 0.05). the results indicate that hiv infection affects the humoral serum immune responses against bacteria in dental plaque; the depressed antibody responses may contribute to the increased susceptibility for periodontal infections in hiv-infected patients.

TI  == "checkerboard" versus culture: a comparison between two methods for identification of subgingival microbiota.
AB  == the present study compared the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization methodology with culture techniques for the analysis of the composition of the subgingival microbiota. 70 subjects, presenting with a variety of periodontal conditions, contributed with a total of 283 subgingival plaque samples analyzed with respect  to the following species: porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus,  eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans. species identification and quantification was performed by (i) the checkerboard method, using whole genomic, digoxigenin labeled dna probes; and (ii) culture, including non-selective and selective media in combination with routine biochemical testing using commercial  test panels. we found that the checkerboard technology resulted in higher prevalence figures for half of the species tested when compared to culture data.  if the latter were used as the reference, checkerboard detection sensitivities ranged from 0.17 to 0.86, specificities from 0.17 to 1.0, and diagnostic accuracies from 0.51 to 0.81, depending on bacterial species. the use of the checkerboard data as the reference resulted in detection sensitivities for the culture procedures between 0.24 and 1.0 and specificities between 0.21 and 0.87.  the checkerboard methodology resulted in statistically significant higher bacterial counts for the majority of the species. it was further observed that, for most species, the higher the total number colony-forming units in the sample, the higher the discrepancy between the results obtained by the two techniques.

TI  == characterization of the lactoferrin-dependent inhibition of the adhesion of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens to fibroblasts and to a reconstituted basement membrane.
AB  == lactoferrin was previously shown to inhibit the adhesion of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens to human cells. lactoferrin was also shown to competitively inhibit the binding of these bacteria to the basement membrane protein laminin. the present study aimed to determine the type of interactions inhibited by lactoferrin. lactoferrin binds to fibroblast monolayers and matrigel, a reconstituted basement membrane, through ionic interactions. the adhesion of a. actinomycetemcomitans to these substrata was mainly dependent on the ionic strength of the environment. p. intermedia and  p. nigrescens also adhere to fibroblasts mainly by ionic interactions, while their adhesion to matrigel seems to be mediated by specific mechanisms. lectin-type interactions were not found to be involved in the binding of these bacteria to the substrata. treatment of either a. actinomycetemcomitans or fibroblasts with lactoferrin decreased the adhesion in a dose-dependent manner, while lactoferrin treatment of matrigel alone had no adhesion-counteracting effect. adhesion of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens to matrigel was not significantly affected by the ionic strength, but the presence of lactoferrin inhibited the adhesion. lactoferrin bound to matrigel, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens was rapidly released, while lactoferrin bound to a. actinomycetemcomitans and fibroblasts was retained. these findings indicate that  lactoferrin-dependent inhibition of the adhesion of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p.  intermedia and p. nigrescens to fibroblasts and matrigel can involve binding of lactoferrin to both the bacteria and substrata. the decreased adhesion may be due to blocking of both specific adhesin-ligand as well as non-specific charge-dependent interactions.

TI  == pathogenicity of prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens isolates in a wound chamber model in rabbits.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 14 isolates identified as prevotella intermedia or prevotella nigrescens by serogrouping using monoclonal antibodies was compared in a tissue cage model in rabbits. seven strains from periodontal abscesses, 5 strains from deep periodontal pockets and 2 strains from gingivitis were tested in the animal model comprising 6 teflon tissue cages implanted on the back each of 34 rabbits. a total of 10(5)-10(8) cells of p. intermedia or p. nigrescens strains were inoculated alone or together with either actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or streptococcus mitis. five strains of porphyromonas gingivalis were used as a reference. the infectivity was recorded as pus formation and log viable count in aspirated material for 3, 7 and 14 days. none of the prevotella strains inoculated in monoculture survived more than 3 days, and they had no capacity to produce abscess. p. intermedia or p. nigrescens strains in combination with a. actinomycetemcomitans produced abscesses in 33-100% and with s. mitis in 42-100%. no difference in abscess formation or log viable count in samples after 14 days was recorded between serogroup i (p. intermedia) and serogroup ii and iii (p. nigrescens). the infectivity of p. intermedia or p. nigresceas strains did not differ whether they were isolated from periodontal abscess, periodontal pocket or gingivitis. p. intermedia and p.  nigrescens strains produced abscesses in combination with a facultative anaerobic strain and appears to have a similar pathogenicity in the wound chamber model in  rabbits.

TI  == degradation of lactoferrin by periodontitis-associated bacteria.
AB  == the degradation of human lactoferrin by putative periodontopathogenic bacteria was examined. fragments of lactoferrin were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and measured by densitometry. the degradation of lactoferrin was more extensive by porphyromonas gingivalis and capnocytophaga sputigena, slow by capnocytophaga ochracea, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia, and very slow or absent by prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter sputorum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and peptostreptococcus micros. all strains of p. gingivalis tested degraded lactoferrin. the degradation was sensitive to protease inhibitors, cystatin c and albumin. the degradation by c. sputigena was not affected by the protease inhibitors and the detected lactoferrin fragments exhibited electrophoretic mobilities similar to those ascribed to deglycosylated forms of lactoferrin. furthermore a weak or absent reactivity of these fragments with sialic acid-specific lectin suggested that they are desialylated. the present data indicate that certain bacteria colonizing the periodontal pocket can degrade lactoferrin. the presence of other human proteins as specific inhibitors and/or as substrate competitors may counteract this degradation process.

TI  == extracts of periodontopathic microorganisms lack functional superantigenic activity for murine t cells.
AB  == products of periodontopathic bacteria exert immunomodulatory effects on various lymphoid cell populations, some of which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. it has recently been suggested that some of these bacterial products may possess superantigenic (sag) activity. sag bind simultaneously to the v beta chain of t cell receptors and to class ii major histocompatibility complex molecules, thereby activating as many as 35% of t cells to proliferate and produce cytokines. in order to examine this question, the proliferation of splenic and thymic t cells from immunologically naive, 3-6-wk-old balb/c (h-2d),  c57bl/6 (h-2b) and c3h/hej (h-2k) mice was assessed in response to sonic extracts of periodontopathogens. laboratory and/or reference strains of a.o. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens were used as stimulants. staphylococcal enterotoxin b (seb), a known superantigen, was utilized as a positive control. unfractionated spleen cells responded to several of the tested preparations of the different bacteria, as well as to seb, con a and escherichia coli lps. thymocytes responded to con a and seb, but not to lps or to any sonic extract. spleen cells depleted of b cells by panning responded to seb and con a, but not to lps and showed a reduced response to sonicates. the residual response of b cell-depleted spleen cells was reduced essentially to background by treatment with anti-thy 1.2 + c'. similar results were obtained in the presence of 5% added mitomycin-treated antigen presenting cells, indicating that these cells were not  limiting. these results demonstrate that extracts of periodontopathic bacteria do not stimulate murine t cells in a manner consistent with superantigenic activation.

TI  == analytical performance of an immunologic-based periodontal bacterial test for simultaneous detection and differentiation of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia.
AB  == the analytical performance of a membrane-based immunoassay for the simultaneous detection and differentiation of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia (including prevotella nigrescens) was investigated. positive reactions were observed for 71 of 71 reference strains and recent oral isolates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and p. intermedia. no cross-reactivity was observed with 39 other common oral and environmental species. the specificity of the test was unaffected by the presence of potential oral interferents including whole blood, white blood cells, mucin, saliva, toothpastes, and oral rinses. a proficiency test by dental  professionals using a standardized set of unknown simulated samples yielded a sensitivity of 97% (116/120) and a 100% specificity (240/ 240). an additional group including dental professionals and high school students was shown to be 99% proficient (1385/1397) in distinguishing proper from improper test function when  processing control samples with normal test devices and devices with simulated error conditions. comparisons to a culture standard for 104 subgingival plaque samples collected from 26 adult periodontitis patients yielded > 98% specificity  for each of the test bacteria. in addition, the detection threshold for the test  was determined to be equivalent to 10(4) cultivable test bacteria when compared to the culture standard. the data indicate that this membrane immunoassay is a valid and easy-to-use method for the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and p. intermedia in subgingival plaque, at levels above the detection threshold of the test.

TI  == clinical, microbiological and immunological profile of healthy, gingivitis and putative active periodontal subjects.
AB  == thirteen periodontally healthy subjects were monitored clinically for 6-12 months. clinical measurements at 6-weekly intervals included duplicate pd measurements, presence of plaque, redness, and bleeding on probing. baseline measurements consisted of 2 visits 1 wk apart. microbial samples were taken from  11 of the subjects who had completed at least 8 months of monitoring. levels of serum antibodies to 12 periodontal species were determined from 10 subjects. standard deviations of replicate pd measurements, computed for each subject, ranged from 0.2-0.3 mm over the monitoring period. plaque and redness increased during monitoring, and showed a weak association with pd change. baseline and follow-up distributions of pd changes indicated that changes of > 1.5 mm could reasonably be considered to represent active sites. five subjects demonstrated at least 1 site deepening by 1.5 mm over the period monitored, and these were considered putative active subjects. sites from 2 subjects showed pd increases in the 6 wk just before sampling, and these were considered to represent active sites. species associated with putative active subjects included actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, selenomonas noxia and prevotella nigrescens. streptococcus sanguis, s. gordonii and peptostreptococcus micros were associated  with inactive subjects. s. gordonii and s. oralis were associated with health, whereas p. nigrescens was associated with gingivitis. elevated serum antibodies were detected to a. actinomycetemcomitans in 4 subjects. the predominant microbiota of putative active subjects included some species previously associated with gingivitis, and some species previously associated with progressing periodontitis.

TI  == response to periodontal therapy in patients with high or low levels of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens and b. forsythus.
AB  == in a previous study, subjects receiving either adjunctive tetracycline or augmentin showed, on average, more attachment level gain 10 months post-therapy than subjects receiving either ibuprofen or a placebo, although some subjects in  each treatment group showed loss of attachment post-therapy. since differences in treatment response might have been due to differences in the subgingival microbiota, the response to different therapies in subjects with different pre-therapy subgingival microbiotas was evaluated. 29 subjects exhibiting loss of attachment > 2.5 mm at 1 or more sites during longitudinal monitoring were treated by modified widman flap surgery at deep sites, subgingival scaling at all other sites and were randomly assigned one of the following agents: augmentin, tetracycline, ibuprofen or a placebo. treatment was completed within 30 days, during which time the subject took the assigned agent. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of each tooth at each visit and evaluated for  their content of 14 subgingival species including p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, p. intermedia and b. forsythus using dna probes. 18 subjects with mean counts > 10(5) of 2 or more of these 4 species comprised the high test species group; 11 subjects with mean counts > 10(5) of 0 or 1 of the species, the low test species  group. because this was a post-hoc analysis, the number of subjects in some of the treatment/test species groups was small. however, the 8 high test species subjects who received tetracycline showed the most attachment level gain (0.83 +/- 0.20 mm), while the 3 tetracycline-treated, low test species subjects showed  minimal gain (0.05 +/- 0.28 mm) 10 months post-therapy. low test species subjects receiving augmentin (n = 2) showed a mean gain in attachment of 0.67 (+/- 0.59) mm. the mean % of sites showing either attachment gain or loss > or = 2 mm was computed for each treatment/test species group. high test species subjects receiving tetracycline exhibited the best ratio of gaining to losing sites (16.2), followed by low test species subjects receiving augmentin (14.1). periodontal pockets < 7 mm pre-therapy in low test species subjects treated with  augmentin and high test species subjects treated with tetracycline showed attachment gain more frequently than attachment loss. the greatest proportion of  gaining sites was seen at pockets > 6 mm, particularly in subjects receiving adjunctive tetracycline. overall, the data indicated that a gain in mean attachment level post-therapy was significantly associated (p < 0.001) with an increase in c. ochracea accompanied by a decrease in b. forsythus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens. the 4 test species were decreased more in subjects receiving tetracycline. in contrast, augmentin appeared to be effective  in decreasing the % sites colonized by a. actinomycetemcomitans and in increasing the proportion of sites colonized by c. ochracea. knowledge of the baseline microbiota should improve the choice of an appropriate adjunctive antibiotic for  periodontal therapy.

AB  == using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the igg antibody levels to specific gram-negative periodontopathic bacteria in serum of 21 adult periodontitis patients and the gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) from 42 sites with destructive lesions and 21 healthy sites were evaluated before and after initial preparation. porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, treponema denticola and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in subgingival plaque samples from the patients were examined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. subgingival plaque, gcf, and serum samples were taken at baseline and three weeks after initial preparation. for 14 patients, changes in clinical parameters due to the initial preparation were correlated with reduction of periodontopathogens and to  igg antibody levels in gcf and serum against them. p. gingivalis, t. denticola and c. rectus were found to be predominant in destructive sites. no significant differences were found in gcf igg antibody levels between destructive and healthy sites. in destructive sites, the prevalence of p. gingivalis and c. rectus was significantly correlated with elevated igg antibody against these microorganisms  in gcf. the initial preparation resulted in significant reduction of serum igg antibody levels against all microorganisms tested. no decrease in gcf igg antibody was observed, but levels to p. gingivalis and c. rectus were significantly increased (p<0.05). the assessment of gcf igg antibodies to specific periodontopathic bacteria may be of considerable value in reflecting the conditions of periodontitis.

TI  == interdental supragingival plaque--a natural habitat of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that suspected periodontal pathogens form a minor component of the supragingival plaque of individuals without periodontal diseases. twenty-one dental hygienist trainees with a mean age of 23.5 years were twice sampled for interdental plaque between 1st and 2nd molars in all quadrants. the samples were assessed for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and the prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens group of organisms. bacteria of this group were predominantly p. nigrescens and showed both the highest prevalence (100%) and the highest colonization density of the investigated species. seven of 21 samples harbored a. actinomycetemcomitans. serotypes a, b, and c were found in three samples each, while serotype e was present in one sample. three subjects had two different a. actinomycetemcomitans  serotypes. bacteroides forsythus and c. rectus were detected in 10 (48%) and nine (43%) subjects, respectively. the detected cell numbers accounted for approximately 0.01% to 1% of the sampled flora. in contrast, p. gingivalis was found only in a single sample, which in addition harbored b. forsythus, c. rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotypes b and e), and p. intermedia. these results suggest that the investigated periodontal bacteria are not "exogenous pathogens", but amphibiotic, opportunistic microorganisms which may have a natural habitat in the supragingival plaque of the interproximal area of molars.
