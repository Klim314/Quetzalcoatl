TI  == early lysis of lactobacillus helveticus cnrz 303 in swiss cheese is not prophage-related.
AB  == lactobacillus helveticus is mainly used as starter in swiss-type cheeses. often,  lysogenic strains are eliminated because of the risk of early lysis and acidification failure due to phage expression. on the other hand, l. helveticus lysis was shown to positively influence cheese proteolysis during ripening. in order to better assess the relationship between lysis and lysogeny, a prophage-cured derivative of l. helveticus cnrz 303 was isolated (lh 303-g11) and relysogenised (lh 303-g11r), as demonstrated by hybridisation using the whole phage dna as probe. the growth, lysis in buffered solutions and lytic activities  in zymogram using either micrococcus luteus or l. helveticus as substrate were identical between the mother strain and its cured derivatives. only morphological differences were observed by scanning electron microscopy: the cells of the cured derivative were shorter in length. the mother strain and its cured and relysogenised derivatives were assayed in triplicate in experimental swiss cheeses (scale 1:100). no differences were noted during the cheese making: the three strains exhibited identical kinetics of acidification, leading to similar cheeses at day 1 in terms of gross composition and ph. phages were detected only  in the cheeses made with the mother strain and the relysogenised derivative. the  lysis of l. helveticus, estimated by viability decrease and release of the intracellular marker d-lactate deshydrogenase, started early before brining and continued during the cold room ripening. no obvious differences of lysis extent were observed. these results demonstrated for the first time that, in the case of lh 303, the extensive lysis observed in cheese is mainly due to autolysin activity and not to prophage induction.

TI  == zymogram and preliminary characterization of lactobacillus helveticus autolysins.
AB  == the autolysins of lactobacillus helveticus islc5 were detected and partially characterized by renaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with substrate-containing gels (zymogram). by using lyophilized micrococcus luteus cells or heated whole cells of l. helveticus islc5 (0.2% [wt/vol]) as a substrate, several lytic activities were detected in the whole-cell sds extract of strain islc5 (i) one activity at 42.4 kda, which was named autolysin a, and (ii) six other activities having very similar molecular weights (29.1, 29.6, 30, 30.8, 31.7, and 32.8 kda), which were named autolysins b (b1 through b6, respectively). as regards the temporal distribution of the enzymes, autolysins a and b were detected in the cells harvested from the beginning of the exponential growth phase. autolysin a appeared to be associated  only with viable cells, whereas the autolysins b remained associated with the cell envelope several days after the complete loss of culture viability. when sds-treated walls of l. helveticus islc5 were used as a substrate, a supplementary lytic activity appeared at 37.5 kda; it was considered a peptidoglycan hydrolase, since it was not able to induce lysis of whole-cell substrate. the autolysins of 30 other strains of l. helveticus from various geographical origins were also analyzed by zymogram; all the activity profiles obtained were similar to that of strain islc5 in terms of the number of lytic bands and their apparent molecular weights. only the relative intensities of the  lytic bands corresponding to autolysins a and b were variable depending on the strains. this observation suggested that autolysins are highly conserved enzymes. a concentrated crude lysate of the virulent bacteriophage 832-b1 infecting l. helveticus was also analyzed by zymogram; one lytic activity with an apparent molecular weight of 31.7 kda, very close to the weights of the autolysins b, was  observed. finally, the autolysins of l. helveticus islc5 were successfully extracted from whole cells by using a 1 m lithium chloride solution; they were partially purified by precipitation, selective resolubilization, and gel filtration chromatography, which led to a 20-fold increase in specific activity.

TI  == transformation of microorganisms with the plasmid vector with the replicon from pac1 from acetobacter pasteurianus.
AB  == a number of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria species was screened for the expression of the gram-negative plasmid pack5 and pact72 with replicon of pac1 plasmid from acetobacter pasteurianus. as was described previously, both plasmids were expressed in escherichia coli, acetobacter pasteurianus, acetobacter aceti,  shigella spp. and citrobacter spp. expressions of plasmids were successful in twelve species tested, comamonas terrigena, salmonella typhimurium, serratia marcescens, bacillus cereus, bacillus megatericum, bacillus subtilis, lactobacillus helveticus, micrococcus luteus, sarcina lutea, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptoccocus feacalis, and the stability of  plasmid dna was tested after cultivation in non-selective conditions.
