TI  - Antiviral activity of SPM1605 against Coxsackievirus B3.
AB  - Bifidobacteria are considered one of the most beneficial probiotics and have been widely studied for their effects against specific pathogens. The present study investigated the antiviral activity of probiotics isolated from Koreans against Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3). The effect of probiotic isolates against CVB3 was measured by the plaque assay and cellular toxicity of bifidobacteria in HeLa cells was measured using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Among 13 probiotic isolates, 3 Bifidobacterium adolescentis, 2 Bifidobacterium longum and 1 Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum had an antiviral effect against CVB3, while the others did not show such effect. B. adolescentis SPM1605 showed the greatest inhibitory properties against CVB3. When the threshold cycle (CT) values for the treated B. adolescentis SPM1605 samples were compared to the results for the non-treated samples, it was shown that the amplified viral sequences from the CVB3 had their copy number lowered by B. adolescentis SPM1605. Moreover, the gene expression in infected HeLa cells was also inhibited by 50%. The results suggest that B. adolescentis SPM1605 suppresses CVB3 and could be used as an alternative therapy against infectious diseases caused by coxsackieviruses.
TI  - Qualitative and Semiquantitative Analysis of Fecal Bifidobacterium Species in Centenarians Living in Bama, Guangxi, China.
AB  - Centenarians constitute a significant subpopulation in the Bama County of Guangxi province in China. The beneficial effects of intestinal microbiota, especially bifidobacteria of centenarians, have been widely accepted; however, knowledge about Bifidobacterium species in centenarians is not adequate. The aim of this study was to investigate the quantity and prevalence of fecal Bifidobacterium in healthy longevous individuals. Fecal samples from eight centenarians from Bama (aged 100 to 108 years), eight younger elderlies from Bama (aged 80 to 99 years), and eight younger elderlies from Nanning (aged 80 to 99 years) were analyzed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, species-specific clone library, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction technology (qPCR). A total of eight different Bifidobacterium species were detected. B. dentium, B. longum, B. thermophilum, B. pseudocatenulatum/B. catenulatum, and B. adolescentis were common in fecal of centenarians and young elderly. B. minimum, B. saecularmay/B. pullorum/B. gallinarum, and B. mongoliense were found in centenarians but were absent in the younger elderlies. In addition, Bifidobacterium species found in centenarians were different from those found in Bama young elderly and Nanning young elderly, and the principal differences were the significant increase in the population of B. longum (P < 0.05) and B. dentium (P < 0.05) and the reduction in the frequency of B. adolescentis (P < 0.05), respectively. Centenarians tend to have more complex fecal Bifidobacterium species than young elderlies from different regions.
TI  - Intestinal microbiota and allergic diseases: A systematic review.
AB  - Evidence suggests that possible imbalances in intestinal microbiota composition may be implicated in the occurrence of allergic diseases. Although several studies published until 2006 indicated a correlation between microbiota composition and allergic symptoms, it has not been possible to distinguish protective microorganisms from those associated with increased risk of allergic diseases. Therefore, the objective of this study was to review the studies published since 2007 that address the intestinal microbiota in allergic diseases. Twenty-one studies were identified after excluding those that performed a clinical intervention before stool collection. In the early microbiota of children who later developed allergies, lower bacterial diversity was observed, with a predominance of Firmicutes; a higher count of Bacteroidaceae; a higher prevalence of the anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, Bifidobacterium catenulatum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Bifidobacterium longum; and a lower prevalence of Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B. bifidum, and Lactobacillus. In the microbiota of allergic children whose intestinal microbiota was assessed at the onset of allergic symptoms, there was a higher count of Bacteroides; a lower count of Akkermansia muciniphila, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Clostridium; a higher prevalence of B. adolescentis; a lower prevalence of B. catenulatum and Staphylococcus aureus; and a lower bacterial diversity.
TI  - Enzymatic production of HMO mimics by the sialylation of galacto-oligosaccharides.
AB  - Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are a family of structurally diverse unconjugated glycans that exhibit a wide range of biological activities. In this report, we describe an efficient, Multi-Enzyme One-Pot strategy to produce HMO mimics by the sialylation of galacto-oligosaccharides (GOSs), which are often added to infant formula as an inexpensive alternative to HMOs. In this system, the sialyltransferase donor, cytidine-5'-monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-Neu5Ac), was generated in situ using a CMP-sialic acid synthetase. The sialylated GOSs were obtained by one-step purification after digesting CMP using the alkaline phosphatase PhoA to cytidine and inorganic phosphate. Although the synthesized alpha2,3-, alpha2,6- and alpha2,3/8-sialyl-GOSs exhibit different sialylation levels and patterns, all of these mixtures can be fermented by Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis ATCC 15697 but not by Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15703. The sialidase NanH2, which is unique to the former strain, hydrolyzed all of the synthesized HMO mimics.
TI  - Establishment of a sensitive system for analysis of human vaginal microbiota on the basis of rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative PCR.
AB  - Ten specific primer sets, for Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus crispatus, Atopobium vaginae, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus curtisii, Chlamydia trachomatis/muridarum, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, and Bifidobacterium angulatum, were developed for quantitative analysis of vaginal microbiota. rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis of the vaginal samples from 12 healthy Japanese volunteers using the new primer sets together with 25 existing primer sets revealed the diversity of their vaginal microbiota: Lactobacilli such as L. crispatus, L. gasseri, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus iners, and Lactobacillus vaginalis, as the major populations at 10(7) cells/ml vaginal fluid, were followed by facultative anaerobes such as Streptococcus and strict anaerobes at lower population levels of 10(4) cells/ml or less. Certain bacterial vaginosis (BV)-related bacteria, such as G. vaginalis, A. vaginae, M. curtisii, and Prevotella, were also detected in some subjects. Especially in one subject, both G. vaginalis and A. vaginae were detected at high population levels of 10(8.8) and 10(8.9) cells/ml vaginal fluid, suggesting that she is an asymptomatic BV patient. These results suggest that the RT-qPCR system is effective for accurate analysis of major vaginal commensals and diagnosis of several vaginal infections.
TI  - Inulin-type fructans modulate intestinal Bifidobacterium species populations and  decrease fecal short-chain fatty acids in obese women.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Inulin-type fructans (ITF) prebiotics promote changes in the composition and activity of the gut microbiota. The aim of this study was to determine variations on fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFA) concentration in obese women treated with ITF and to explore associations between Bifidobacterium species, SCFA and host biological markers of metabolism. METHODS: Samples were obtained in a randomized, double blind, parallel, placebo-controlled trial, with 30 obese women randomly assigned to groups that received either 16 g/day ITF (n = 15) or maltodextrin (n = 15) for 3 months. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of Bifidobacterium spp. was performed in feces by PCR-DGGE and q-PCR, and SCFA profile was analyzed by gas chromatography. Spearman correlation analysis was performed between the different variables analyzed. RESULTS: The species Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and Bifidobacterium adolescentis were significantly increased at the end of the treatment in the prebiotic group (p < 0.01) with being B. longum negatively correlated with serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxin (p < 0.01). Total SCFA, acetate and propionate, that positively correlated with BMI, fasting insulinemia and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) (p < 0.05), were significantly lower in prebiotic than in placebo group after the treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: ITF consumption selectively modulates Bifidobacterium spp. and decreases fecal SCFA concentration in obese women. ITF could lessen metabolic risk factors associated with higher fecal SCFA concentration in obese individuals.
TI  - Antibodies to Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria in young children with different propensity to develop islet autoimmunity.
AB  - The intestinal microbiota is essential to the maturation and homeostasis of the immune system. Immunoblot assays were used to establish the prevalence of serum IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies specific for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium longum, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG proteins in young children presenting with or without type 1 diabetes (T1D). We demonstrated that children between the ages of 6 and 12 months had a substantial increase in the frequency of IgG antibodies specific for L. rhamnosus GG proteins. We measured IgG, IgM, and IgA class antibody reactivity against B. adolescentis DSM 20083, B. adolescentis DSM 20086, and B. longum DSM 20088 proteins demonstrating significantly higher IgA responses against B. adolescentis DSM 20083 strain proteins in children who developed islet autoimmunity and T1D later in life. B. adolescentis strains showed more IgM type antibodies in children who developed T1D later in life, but the difference was not statistically significant. B. longum proteins were recognized by IgG and IgA antibodies to a higher extent compared to other bacteria studied. These results confirm that differences in immune reactivity against some commensal strains in young children may represent a different risk factor for developing T1D.
TI  - [Application of multiplex PCR for analysis of polycomponent probiotic preparations].
AB  - AIM: Development of multiplex PCR for indication and differential analysis of CFU in a probiotic preparation containing 3 various species ofbifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. longum, B. adolescentis) and 2 species of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum). MATERIALS AND METHODS; Multiplex PCR with primers to 16S RNA genes of 5 species of bacteria was applied. Samples of bacterial colonies were removed from solid nutrient medium and transferred into test-tube for multiplex PCR execution. Bacterial lysates were used as target-matrix for amplification and determination of presence of the required amplicons. RESULTS: Multiplex PCR for detection of CFU of each of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli strains in samples of 5-component probiotic with accuracy up to species was developed. A reagent kit was fine-tuned and high reproducibility and specificity of the multiplex PCR method with the accuracy of 90 - 95% of cases was shown. CONCLUSION: The multiplex PCR method developed is recommended to be applied for CFU control of each bacterial component in a complex probiotic preparation.
TI  - Isomer-specific consumption of galactooligosaccharides by bifidobacterial species.
AB  - Prebiotics are nondigestible substrates that stimulate the growth of beneficial microbes in the human intestine. Galactooligosaccharides (GOS) are food ingredients that possess prebiotic properties, in particular, promoting the growth of bifidobacteria in situ. However, precise mechanistic details of GOS consumption by bifidobacteria remain poorly understood. Because GOS are mixtures of polymers of different lengths and linkages, there is interest in determining which specific structures provide prebiotic effects to potentially create better supplements. This paper presents a method comprising porous graphitic carbon separation, isotopic labeling, and mass spectrometry analysis for the structure-specific analysis of GOS isomers and their bacterial consumption rate. Using this strategy, the differential bacterial consumption of GOS by the bifidobacteria species Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, and Bifidobacterium adolescentis was determined, indicating that the use of specific GOS isomers in infant formula may provide enrichment of distinct species.
TI  - Mother-to-infant transmission of intestinal bifidobacterial strains has an impact on the early development of vaginally delivered infant's microbiota.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Bifidobacterium species are one of the major components of the infant's intestine microbiota. Colonization with bifidobacteria in early infancy is suggested to be important for health in later life. However, information remains limited regarding the source of these microbes. Here, we investigated whether specific strains of bifidobacteria in the maternal intestinal flora are transmitted to their infant's intestine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fecal samples were collected from healthy 17 mother and infant pairs (Vaginal delivery: 12; Cesarean section delivery: 5). Mother's feces were collected twice before delivery. Infant's feces were collected at 0 (meconium), 3, 7, 30, 90 days after birth. Bifidobacteria isolated from feces were genotyped by multilocus sequencing typing, and the transitions of bifidobacteria counts in infant's feces were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: Stains belonging to Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium catenulatum, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, were identified to be monophyletic between mother's and infant's intestine. Eleven out of 12 vaginal delivered infants carried at least one monophyletic strain. The bifidobacterial counts of the species to which the monophyletic strains belong, increased predominantly in the infant's intestine within 3 days after birth. Among infants delivered by C-section, monophyletic strains were not observed. Moreover, the bifidobacterial counts were significantly lower than the vaginal delivered infants until 7 days of age. CONCLUSIONS: Among infants born vaginally, several Bifidobacterium strains transmit from the mother and colonize the infant's intestine shortly after birth. Our data suggest that the mother's intestine is an important source for the vaginal delivered infant's intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Different human gut models reveal the distinct fermentation patterns of Arabinoxylan versus inulin.
AB  - Different in vitro models have been developed to assess how food compounds affect the human gut microbiota. Using two such models (SHIME(R) and TIM-2), we compared how long-chain arabinoxylan (LC-AX), a wheat-derived potentially prebiotic fiber, and inulin (IN), a well-established prebiotic compound, modulate SCFA production and bifidobacteria composition. While both the SHIME and TIM-2 differ in experimental design, they both demonstrated that LC-AX and IN specifically increased the health-promoting metabolites propionate and butyrate, respectively. Furthermore, LC-AX stimulated Bifidobacterium longum, while IN stimulated other bifidobacteria including Bifidobacterium adolescentis. The SHIME experiment also revealed that effects of LC-AX were more persistent during the 2-week wash-out period. These results confirm a recent in vivo study, during which humanized rats were treated with the same LC-AX/IN. In conclusion, results from different human gut models suggest that, besides IN, LC-AX are promising prebiotic candidates with high specificity toward Bifidobacterium longum and a selective propionate increase.
TI  - Differential modulation of human intestinal bifidobacterium populations after consumption of a wild blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium) drink.
AB  - Bifidobacteria are gaining increasing interest as health-promoting bacteria. Nonetheless, the genus comprises several species, which can exert different effects on human host. Previous studies showed that wild blueberry drink consumption could selectively increase intestinal bifidobacteria, suggesting an important role for the polyphenols and fiber present in wild blueberries. This study evaluated the modulation of the most common and abundant bifidobacterial taxonomic groups inhabiting the human gut in the same fecal samples. The analyses carried out showed that B. adolescentis, B. breve, B. catenulatum/pseudocatelulatum, and B. longum subsp. longum were always present in the group of subjects enrolled, whereas B. bifidum and B. longum subsp. infantis were not. Furthermore, it was found that the most predominant bifidobacterial species were B. longum subsp. longum and B. adolescentis. The results obtained revealed a high interindividual variability; however, a significant increase of B. longum subsp. infantis cell concentration was observed in the feces of volunteers after the wild blueberry drink treatment. This bifidobacterial group was shown to possess immunomodulatory abilities and to relieve symptoms and promote the regression of several gastrointestinal disorders. Thus, an increased cell concentration of B. longum subsp. infantis in the human gut could be considered of potential health benefit. In conclusion, wild blueberry consumption resulted in a specific bifidogenic effect that could positively affect certain populations of bifidobacteria with demonstrated health-promoting properties.
TI  - Cholesterol-lowering probiotics: in vitro selection and in vivo testing of bifidobacteria.
AB  - Thirty-four strains of bifidobacteria belonging to Bifidobacterium adolescentis,  Bifidobacterium animalis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium longum, and Bifidobacterium pseu-docatenulatum were assayed in vitro for the ability to assimilate cholesterol and for bile salt hydrolase (BSH) against glycocholic and taurodeoxycholic acids (GCA and TDCA). Cholesterol assimilation was peculiar characteristic of two strains belonging to the species B. bifidum (B. bifidum MB 107 and B. bifidum MB 109), which removed 81 and 50 mg of cholesterol per gram of biomass, being the median of specific cholesterol absorption by bifidobacteria 19 mg/g. Significant differences in BSH activities were not established among bifidobacterial species. However, the screening resulted in the selection of promising strains able to efficiently deconjugate GCA and TDCA. No relationship was recognized between BSH phenotype and the extent of cholesterol assimilation. On the basis of cholesterol assimilation or BSHGCA and BSHTDCA activities, B. bifidum MB 109 (DSMZ 23731), B. breve MB 113 (DSMZ 23732), and B. animalis subsp. lactis MB 2409 (DSMZ 23733) were combined in a probiotic mixture to be fed to hypercholesterolemic rats. The administration of this probiotic formulation resulted in a significant reduction of total cholesterol and low-density cholesterol (LDL-C), whereas it did not affect high-density cholesterol (HDL-C) and HDL-C/LDL-C ratio.
TI  - Tolerance of Bifidobacterium human isolates to bile, acid and oxygen.
AB  - Bifidobacteria are part of the human gastrointestinal microbiota and are used as  probiotics in functional food products because of their health promoting properties. However, only few data are available on the phenotypic characteristics displayed by human bifidobacteria strain populations. In this study we compared the in vitro tolerance to acid, bile and oxygen of the largest number of independent human intestinal strains. Bile and acid tolerance varied among species and independent strains within a species: B. adolescentis strains were the most tolerant to bile followed by Bifidobacterium longum and B. breve; B. longum, B. breve and B. dentium showed the highest viability levels after exposure to acid pH. Oxygen tolerance was largely distributed among intestinal bifidobacteria: B. longum, B. breve and B. bifidum showed the highest oxygen tolerance. B. adolescentis showed the highest susceptibility to acid and oxygen stresses. The present study gave us the opportunity to update our knowledge about the phenotypic characteristics of human intestinal bifidobacteria. B. longum and B. breve harboured the best tolerance to oxygen, bile and acid stresses. Based on such biological characters, B. longum and B. breve species showed the highest interest in terms of potential selection of human probiotics.
TI  - Ethnic diversity of gut microbiota: species characterization of Bacteroides fragilis group and genus Bifidobacterium in healthy Belgian adults, and comparison with data from Japanese subjects.
AB  - The composition of the human gut microbiota is related to host health, and it is  thought that dietary habits may play a role in shaping this composition. Here, we examined the population size and prevalence of six predominant bacterial genera and the species compositions of genus Bifidobacterium (g-Bifid) and Bacteroides fragilis group (g-Bfra) in 42 healthy Belgian adults by quantitative PCR (qPCR) over a period of one month. The population sizes and prevalence of these bacteria were basically stable throughout the study period. The predominant g-Bifid species were Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Bifidobacterium longum ss. longum, and the predominant g-Bfra species were Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides uniformis, and Bacteroides ovatus. The Belgian gut microbiota data were then compared with gut microbiota data from 46 Japanese subjects collected according to the same protocol (Matsuki et al., Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 70, 167-173, 2004). The population size and prevalence of Bifidobacterium catenulatum group were significantly lower in the Belgian gut microbiota than in the Japanese gut microbiota (P < 0.001); however, the population size and prevalence of g-Bifid did not differ. This species-level qPCR analysis will be helpful for investigating the diversity of gut microbiota among ethnic groups.
TI  - Effects of antibiotics on bacterial species composition and metabolic activities  in chemostats containing defined populations of human gut microorganisms.
AB  - The composition and metabolic activities of the human colonic microbiota are modulated by a number of external factors, including diet and antibiotic therapy. Changes in the structure and metabolism of the gut microbiota may have long-term consequences for host health. The large intestine harbors a complex microbial ecosystem comprising several hundreds of different bacterial species, which complicates investigations on intestinal physiology and ecology. To facilitate such studies, a highly simplified microbiota consisting of 14 anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic organisms (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Clostridium butyricum, C. perfringens, C. bifermentans, C. innocuum, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus) was used in this investigation. Ampicillin [9.2 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to two chemostats operated at different dilution rates (D; 0.10 h(-1) and 0.21 h(-1)), and metronidazole [76.9 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to a third vessel (D = 0.21 h(-1)). Perturbations in bacterial physiology and metabolism were sampled over a 48-h period. Lactobacillus acidophilus and C. bifermentans populations did not establish in the fermentors under the imposed growth conditions. Ampicillin resulted in substantial reductions in bacteroides and C. perfringens populations at both dilution rates. Metronidazole strongly affected bacteroides communities but had no effect on bifidobacterial communities. The bacteriostatic effect of ampicillin on bifidobacterial species was growth rate dependent. Several metabolic activities were affected by antibiotic addition, including fermentation product formation and enzyme synthesis. The growth of antibiotic-resistant bifidobacteria in the large bowel may enable them to occupy ecological niches left vacant after antibiotic administration, preventing colonization by pathogenic species.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria attenuate the proinflammatory response in intestinal epithelial cells induced by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.
AB  - Inflammation is a physiological response to infections and tissue injury; however, abnormal immune responses can give rise to chronic inflammation and contribute to disease progression. Various dietary components, including probiotic lactic acid bacteria and prebiotics, have the potential to modulate intestinal inflammatory responses. One factor in particular, the chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8, CXCL-8), is one of the major mediators of the inflammatory response. The purpose of this study was to investigate modulation of the inflammatory host response induced by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 in the presence of selected probiotics and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from human sources, dairy products, and farm animals. IL-8 gene expression and protein production in HT-29 cells were evaluated by real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. Pre-incubation of HT-29 cells with Lactobacillus kefir IM002, Bifidobacterium adolescentis FRP 61, Bifidobacterium longum FRP 68 and FRP 69, Bifidobacterium breve FRP 334, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides IM080 significantly inhibited IL-8 secretion induced by Salmonella Typhimurium DT104. Co-culture of selected probiotics and Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 reduced IL-8 production, while potential probiotics and LAB had no effect on IL-8 secretion in HT-29 cells preincubated with Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 prior to adding probiotics. Lactobacillus kefir IM002 supernatant also significantly reduced IL-8 production. In conclusion, our study suggests that probiotic bifidobacteria and LAB modulate cytokine induction and possess anti-inflammatory properties; however, the effectiveness is strain dependent.
TI  - Isolation of a bifidogenic peptide from the pepsin hydrolysate of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  - Lactoferrin is an iron-binding glycoprotein found in the milk of most mammals for which various biological functions have been reported, such as antimicrobial activity and bifidogenic activity. In this study, we compared the bifidogenic activity of bovine lactoferrin (bLF) and pepsin hydrolysate of bLF (bLFH), isolated bifidogenic peptide from bLFH, and investigated the bifidogenic spectra of bLF, bLFH, and its active peptide against 42 bifidobacterial strains comprising nine species. Against Bifidobacterium breve ATCC 15700(T), minimal effective concentrations of bLF and bLFH were 300 and 10 mug/ml. Against Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis ATCC 15697(T), the minimal effective concentration of bLFH was 30 mug/ml, and bLF did not show bifidogenic activity within 300 mug/ml. As an active peptide, a heterodimer of A(1)-W(16) and L(43)-A(48) linked by a disulfide bond was isolated. Previously, this peptide was identified as having antibacterial activity. An amino acid mixture with the same composition as this peptide showed no bifidogenic activity. The strains of each species whose growth was highly promoted (>150%) by this peptide at 3.75 muM were as follows: B. breve (7 out of 7 strains [7/7]), B. longum subsp. infantis (5/5), Bifidobacterium bifidum (2/5), B. longum subsp. longum (1/3), Bifidobacterium adolescentis (3/6), Bifidobacterium catenulatum (1/4), Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum (0/4), Bifidobacterium dentium (0/5), and Bifidobacterium angulatum (0/3). Growth of none of the strains was highly promoted by bLF at 3.75 muM. We demonstrated that bLFH showed stronger bifidogenic activity than natural bLF, especially against infant-representative species, B. breve and B. longum subsp. infantis; furthermore, we isolated its active peptide. This is the first report about a bifidogenic peptide derived from bLF.
TI  - Long-term changes in human colonic Bifidobacterium populations induced by a 5-day oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid treatment.
AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the possible modifications due to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AMC) treatment on total bacteria and on Bifidobacterium species balance in human colonic microbiota. Eighteen healthy volunteers (19 to 36 years old) were given a 875/125 mg dose of AMC twice a day for 5 days. Fecal samples were obtained before and after antibiotic exposure. After total DNA extraction, total bacteria and bifidobacteria were specifically quantified using real-time PCR. Dominant species were monitored over time using bacterial and bifidobacterial Temporal Temperature Gradient gel Electrophoresis (TTGE). At the end of AMC exposure, total bacterial concentrations as well as bifidobacteria concentrations were significantly reduced compared to before AMC exposure:10.7+/-0.1 log(10) 16S rRNA gene copies/g vs 11.1+/-0.1 log(10) (p = 0.003) and 8.1+/-0.5 log(10) 16S rRNA gene copies/g vs 9.4+/-0.3 log(10) (p = 0.003), respectively. At the same time, the mean similarity percentages of TTGE bacteria and TTGE bifidobacteria profiles were significantly reduced compared to before AMC exposure: 51.6%+/-3.5% vs 81.4%+/-2.1% and 55.8%+/-7.6% vs 84.5%+/-4.1%, respectively. Occurrence of B. adolescentis, B. bifidum and B. pseudocatenulatum/B. catenulatum species significantly decreased. Occurrence of B. longum remained stable. Moreover, the number of distinct Bifidobacterium species per sample significantly decreased (1.5+/-0.3 vs 2.3+/-0.3; p = 0.01). Two months after AMC exposure, the mean similarity percentage of TTGE profiles was 55.6% for bacteria and 62.3% for bifidobacteria. These results clearly demonstrated that a common antibiotic treatment may qualitatively alter the colonic microbiota. Such modifications may have potential long-term physiological consequences.
TI  - Breast milk jaundice: effect of bacteria present in breast milk and infant feces.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Breast milk is an important source of bacteria in establishing the infantile intestinal microbiota that appear to influence the enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of breast milk's microbiological content on the development of breast milk jaundice (BMJ). METHODS: A total number of 60 mother-infant pairs enrolled to the study. Two groups were defined: BMJ group (n=30), full-term otherwise healthy newborns who were considered BMJ; control group (n=30), full-term healthy newborns without jaundice. All newborns in the study were exclusively breast-fed. The breast milk samples and the feces of infants were evaluated for content of selected bacterial populations (Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus species) with real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Bifidobacterium bifidum content in the breast milk and B adolescentis, B bifidum, and B longum content in the fecal samples were higher in the control group than in the BMJ group. The milk and fecal concentrations of B bifidum were significantly correlated. The concentrations of breast milk B bifidum and fecal B bifidum, B adolescentis, and B longum were found to be negatively correlated with bilirubin levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that Bifidobacterium species in breast milk may protect against BMJ.
TI  - Bifidobacterial succession and correlation networks in a large unselected cohort  of mothers and their children.
AB  - Bifidobacteria are a major microbial component of infant gut microbiota, which is believed to promote health benefits for the host and stimulate maturation of the immune system. Despite their perceived importance, very little is known about the natural development of and possible correlations between bifidobacteria in human populations. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed stool samples from a randomly selected healthy cohort of 87 infants and their mothers with >90% of vaginal delivery and nearly 100% breast-feeding at 4 months. Fecal material was sampled during pregnancy, at 3 and 10 days, at 4 months, and at 1 and 2 years after birth. Stool samples were predicted to be rich in the species Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B. bifidum, B. dentium, B. breve, and B. longum. Due to high variation, we did not identify a clear age-related structure at the individual level. Within the population as a whole, however, there were clear age-related successions. Negative correlations between the B. longum group and B. adolescentis were detected in adults and in 1- and 2-year-old children, whereas negative correlations between B. longum and B. breve were characteristic for newborns and 4-month-old infants. The highly structured age-related development of and correlation networks between bifidobacterial species during the first 2 years of life mirrors their different or competing nutritional requirements, which in turn may be associated with specific biological functions in the development of healthy gut.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of antibacterial activities and anti-inflammatory effects of  Bifidobacterium spp. addressing acne vulgaris.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effect of Bifidobacterium spp. In the first part of the study, the antibacterial activities of live and sonicated cells, from a total of 23 Bifidobacterium species, on the growth of 5 different strain of Staphylococcus aureus. Six strains, of sonicated Bifidobacterium, exhibited antibacterial activity against staphylococci samples, and seven Bifidobacterium strains exhibited antibacterial activity on the growth of S. aureus S.P.-N2. In the second part of the study, we tested the antimicrobial activity, of Bifidobacterium against Propionibacterium acne KCTC3320, using the co-culture method. The loss of P. acnes viability, caused by B. adolescentis SPM0308 and B. longum SPM1207, was 84% and 75%, respectively (*p < 0.05). In the third part of the study, the anti-inflammatory activity of B. adolescentis SPM0308 and B. longum SPM1207 were assessed; nitric oxide (NO), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), production were tested using the murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cell line. Treatment of RAW 264.7 cells, with Bifidobacterium, decreased production of NO and TNF-alpha rather than LPS (100 ng/mL) treatment. The results suggest that B. adolescentis SPM0308 could be used as an effective control for P. acnes KCTC3320, and S. aureus, and reduce the risk of acne vulgaris development. We suggest that B. adolescentis SPM0308 may be a useful probiotic microorganism, for prevention of acne vulgaris, without adverse effects.
TI  - A targeted gene knockout method using a newly constructed temperature-sensitive plasmid mediated homologous recombination in Bifidobacterium longum.
AB  - Bifidobacteria are the main component of the human microflora. We constructed a temperature-sensitive (Ts) plasmid by random mutagenesis of the Bifidobacterium-Escherichia coli shuttle vector pKKT427 using error-prone PCR. Mutant plasmids were introduced into Bifidobacterium longum 105-A and, after screening approximately 3,000 colonies, candidate clones that grew at 30 degrees C but not at 42 degrees C were selected. According to DNA sequence analysis of the Ts plasmid, five silent and one missense mutations were found in the repB region. The site-directed mutagenesis showed only the missense mutation to be relevant to the Ts phenotype. We designated this plasmid pKO403. The Ts phenotype was also observed in B. longum NCC2705 and Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC15703. Single-crossover homologous-recombination experiments were carried out to determine the relationship between the length of homologous sequences encoded on the plasmid and recombination frequency: fragments greater than 1 kb gave an efficiency of more than 10(3) integrations per cell. We performed gene knockout experiments using this Ts plasmid. We obtained gene knockout mutants of the pyrE region of B. longum 105-A, and determined that double-crossover homologous recombination occurred at an efficiency of 1.8 %. This knockout method also worked for the BL0033 gene in B. longum NCC2705.
TI  - Inter-species differences in the growth of bifidobacteria cultured on human milk  oligosaccharides.
AB  - Human milk (HM) contains as the third most abundant component around 200 different structures of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs). HMOs are the first and irreplaceable prebiotics for infants, supporting bifidobacteria as the most important bacterial group in an infant intestine. The aim of our study was to test the growth of bifidobacteria in HM and on HMOs. Bifidobacteria were isolated from two groups of infants. The first one (eight strains) were isolated from infants who had bifidobacteria in their feces but, after a short period of time (4 to 24 days), bifidobacteria were no longer detected in their feces (disappeared bifidobacteria [DB]). The second group of bifidobacteria (eight strains) originated from infants with continual presence of bifidobacteria in their feces (persistent bifidobacteria [PB]). There were significant differences (p < 0.05) between DB and PB groups in the ability of the strains to grow in HM. PB grew in HM, reaching counts higher than 7 log CFU/ml. In contrast, counts of DB decreased from 5 to 4.3 log CFU/ml after cultivation in HM. The final pH after cultivation of bifidobacteria on HMOs was 6.2 and 4.9 in DP and PB groups, respectively. In general, Bifidobacterium bifidum and B. breve species were able to utilize HMOs, while B. adolescentis and B. longum subsp. longum species did not. The ability to grow in HM and to utilize HMOs seem to be important properties of bifidobacteria which are able to colonize infant intestinal tract.
TI  - Quantification of human fecal bifidobacterium species by use of quantitative real-time PCR analysis targeting the groEL gene.
AB  - Quantitative real-time PCR assays targeting the groEL gene for the specific enumeration of 12 human fecal Bifidobacterium species were developed. The housekeeping gene groEL (HSP60 in eukaryotes) was used as a discriminative marker for the differentiation of Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B. angulatum, B. animalis, B. bifidum, B. breve, B. catenulatum, B. dentium, B. gallicum, B. longum, B. pseudocatenulatum, B. pseudolongum, and B. thermophilum. The bifidobacterial chromosome contains a single copy of the groEL gene, allowing the determination of the cell number by quantification of the groEL copy number. Real-time PCR assays were validated by comparing fecal samples spiked with known numbers of a given Bifidobacterium species. Independent of the Bifidobacterium species tested, the proportion of groEL copies recovered from fecal samples spiked with 5 to 9 log(10) cells/g feces was approximately 50%. The quantification limit was 5 to 6 log(10) groEL copies/g feces. The interassay variability was less than 10%, and variability between different DNA extractions was less than 23%. The method developed was applied to fecal samples from healthy adults and full-term breast-fed infants. Bifidobacterial diversity in both adults and infants was low, with mostly </=3 Bifidobacterium species and B. longum frequently detected. The predominant species in infant and adult fecal samples were B. breve and B. adolescentis, respectively. It was possible to distinguish B. catenulatum and B. pseudocatenulatum. We conclude that the groEL gene is a suitable molecular marker for the specific and accurate quantification of human fecal Bifidobacterium species by real-time PCR.
TI  - Effects of administration of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis GCL2505 on defecation frequency and bifidobacterial microbiota composition in humans.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in endogenous bifidobacteria and administered Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (B. lactis) GCL2505 (GCL2505) in the intestine after administration of GCL2505 by means of a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind, cross-over study. An increase in the number of total bifidobacteria (the sum of B. bifidum, B. breve, B. longum subsp. longum, B. adolescentis, B. anglatum, B. catenulatum, B. pseudocatenulatum, B. dentium, B. longum subsp. infantis and B. lactis) in the feces were observed after administration of GCL2505 using species- and subspecies-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. However, the number of endogenous bifidobacteria species (excluding B. lactis) remained unchanged. B. lactis also became the predominant bifidobacterial species. Taking into account the number of GCL2505 administered, the findings further suggested that GCL2505 proliferated in the intestine. In addition, the defecation frequency increased during GCL2505 administration compared with the placebo. Moreover, a single administration study (n=17) clearly demonstrated that GCL2505 successfully reached the intestine before proliferating at least 10-fold. This is the first report to show an increase in intestinal bifidobacteria, with no changes to the endogenous species, and improvements in constipation following proliferation of administered bifidobacteria.
TI  - Bifidobacterium bifidum NCC 453 promotes tolerance induction in murine models of  sublingual immunotherapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enhancing clinical efficacy remains a major goal in allergen-specific immunotherapy. In this study, we tested three strains of bifidobacteria as candidate adjuvants for sublingual allergy vaccines. METHODS: Probiotic candidates were evaluated in human monocyte-derived dendritic cell (h-DC) maturation and CD4(+) T-cell polarization in vitro models and further tested in murine models of sublingual immunotherapy in BALB/c mice sensitized to either ovalbumin or birch pollen. RESULTS: Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B. bifidum and B. longum induced h-DC maturation and polarized naive CD4(+) T cells toward interferon-gamma and interleukin-10 production. B. bifidum increased CD25(high), Foxp3(+) cells within CD4(+) T lymphocytes and was the most potent inducer of interferon-gamma in Th2-skewed peripheral blood mononuclear cells and h-DC T-cell cocultures. It also induced a significant decrease in airway hyperresponsiveness in BALB/c mice sensitized to ovalbumin. Sublingual administration of B. bifidum together with recombinant Bet v 1 enhanced tolerance induction in BALB/c mice sensitized to birch pollen, with a downregulation of both airway hyperresponsiveness, lung inflammation and Bet v 1-specific Th2 responses. CONCLUSIONS: Due to its capacity to reorient established Th2 responses toward Th1/regulatory T-cell profiles, B. bifidum represents a valid candidate adjuvant for specific immunotherapy of type I allergies.
TI  - Short communication: Identification and differentiation of bifidobacteria obtained from Ukraine.
AB  - Ten freeze-dried bifidobacterial strains used as probiotics in Ukrainian dairy foods, identified by the supplier as Bifidobacterium adolescentis (2), Bifidobacterium bifidum (2), Bifidobacterium longum (4), Bifidobacterium animalis (1), and Bifidobacterium infantis (1), were characterized. Following rehydration and anaerobic growth on de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe-cysteine medium at 37 degrees C for 72 h, single-colony isolates were picked and evaluated using PCR primers specific for the Bifidobacterium genus, for the supplier-identified species, and for B. animalis ssp. lactis. All isolates were identified as members of the genus Bifidobacterium; however, species-specific PCR revealed all 10 isolates were actually strains of B. animalis ssp. lactis. Further evaluation using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was only able to separate a single strain (RT 09) from the other 9 strains evaluated. Application of genome-wide allelic profiling to the Ukrainian bifidobacterial strains revealed 4 distinct groups. Interestingly, 6 (60%) of the isolates fell into the same cluster as that containing the common commercial probiotic strain BB-12. Two of the strains (RT 02 and RT 09) were found to be in the same group as ATCC 27536 and one strain (RT 08) was in the same group as the RB 7239 (a previously evaluated commercial strain). One strain, RT 04, was placed on a unique branch. These results highlight the importance of employing routine typing of bifidobacterial isolates, demonstrate the utility of single nucleotide polymorphism/insertion-deletion polymorphism-based allelic typing in B. animalis ssp. lactis strain differentiation and further point to the limited genetic variability of B. animalis ssp. lactis strains and the worldwide distribution of a small number of commercial strains.
TI  - Genetic analysis and morphological identification of pilus-like structures in members of the genus Bifidobacterium.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cell surface pili in Gram positive bacteria have been reported to orchestrate the colonization of host tissues, evasion of immunity and the development of biofilms. So far, little if any information is available on the presence of pilus-like structures in human gut commensals like bifidobacteria. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: In this report, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) of various bifidobacterial strains belonging to Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, Bifidobacterium dentium, Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis revealed the existence of appendages resembling pilus-like structures. Interestingly, these microorganisms harbour two to six predicted pilus gene clusters in their genome, with each organized in an operon encompassing the major pilin subunit-encoding gene (designated fimA or fimP) together with one or two minor pilin subunit-encoding genes (designated as fimB and/or fimQ), and a gene encoding a sortase enzyme (strA). Quantitative Real Time (qRT)-PCR analysis and RT-PCR experiments revealed a polycistronic mRNA, encompassing the fimA/P and fimB/Q genes, which are differentially expressed upon cultivation of bifidobacteria on various glycans.
TI  - Arabinoxylans and inulin differentially modulate the mucosal and luminal gut microbiota and mucin-degradation in humanized rats.
AB  - The endogenous gut microbiota affects the host in many ways. Prebiotics should favour beneficial intestinal microbes and thus improve host health. In this study, we investigated how a novel class of potential prebiotic long-chain arabinoxylans (LC-AX) and the well-established prebiotic inulin (IN) modulate the gut microbiota of humanized rats. Six weeks after axenic rats were inoculated with a human faecal microbiota, their colonic microbiota was similar to this inoculum ( approximately 70%), whereas their caecal microbiota was enriched with Verrucomicrobia and Firmicutes concomitant with lower abundance of Bacteroidetes. Moreover, different Bifidobacterium species colonized the lumen (B. adolescentis) and mucus (B. longum and B. bifidum). Both LC-AX and IN increased SCFA levels and induced a shift from acetate towards health-promoting propionate and butyrate respectively. By applying a high-resolution phylogenetic micro-array (HITChip) at the site of fermentation (caecum), IN and LC-AX were shown to stimulate bacterial groups with known butyrate-producers (Roseburia intestinalis, Eubacterium rectale, Anaerostipes caccae) and bifidobacteria (B. longum) respectively. Prebiotic administration also resulted in lower caecal abundances of the mucin-degrading Akkermansia muciniphila and potentially more mucin production by the host. Both factors might explain the increased caecal mucin levels for LC-AX (threefold) and IN (sixfold). These mucins were degraded along the colon, resulting in high faecal abundances of Akkermansia muciniphila for LC-AX and especially IN-treated rats. Finally, the microbial changes caused an adaptation period for the host with less weight gain, after which the host fine-tuned the interaction with this altered microbiota. Our results demonstrate that next to IN, LC-AX are promising prebiotic compounds by stimulating production of health-promoting metabolites by specific microbes in the proximal regions. Further, prebiotic supplementation shifted mucin degradation to distal regions, where mucin-degraders may produce beneficial metabolites (e.g. propionate by Akkermansia muciniphila), so that prebiotics may potentially improve gut health along the entire length of the intestine.
TI  - The role of components of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in pathogenesis and serologic diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid diseases.
AB  - During recent years, researchers have been focusing on the concept of an infectious etiology of autoimmune diseases. The most discussed theory is molecular mimicry, i.e. the emergence of autoreactive clones of T- and B-lymphocytes as a result of cross-immune response to homologous bacterial or viral antigen. Information on the role of probiotic microorganisms (PM) in the molecular mechanisms of autoimmune thyroid diseases (ATD) is limited. Using proteins and immunogenic peptides databanks and relevant computer programs, the homology between the amino acid sequences of thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin (Tg), which are potential B- and T-cell epitopes of these antigens, and proteins of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli was established. Moreover, we have found components of cells of Bifidobacterium bifidum 791, Bifidobacterium adolescentis 94 BIM, Bifidobacterium longum B379M and Lactobacillus plantarum B-01 that selectively bind human antibodies to TPO (anti-TPO) and antibodies to Tg (anti-Tg) and compete with natural antigens for the binding of anti-TPO and anti-Tg in ELISA. Additionally, a three-fold difference was observed between the probability of detecting antibodies (Abs) to the antigens of L. plantarum B-01 and B. bifidum 791 in serum samples containing and those not containing anti-TPO. On the whole, our data are arguments in favour of the assumption of the possible role of PM of the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in triggering ATD by the mechanism of molecular mimicry. The data obtained in silico and in vitro should be proven by use of animal models and clinical studies for extrapolations to the whole body. Possible antigenic properties of components/proteins of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, selectively binding anti-TPO and anti-Tg should be taken into consideration. Natural human Abs to these bacterial components are probably able to cross-react with the TPO and Tg in the ELISA for detection of anti-TPO and anti-Tg, which are serologic markers of ATD. It can lead to unspecific false positive results and, hence, to an incorrect diagnosis.
TI  - Immunostimulatory effect of faecal Bifidobacterium species of breast-fed and formula-fed infants in a peripheral blood mononuclear cell/Caco-2 co-culture system.
AB  - Bifidobacterium spp. typical of the human intestinal microbiota are believed to influence the balance of immune responses in the intestinal mucosa. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of different bifidobacterial species and their mixtures in in vitro experiments with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Caco-2 cells. Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B. angulatum, B. breve, B. catenulatum, B. infantis, B. longum and two combinations of these bifidobacteria simulating the species composition found in faecal samples from breast-fed (BF) and formula-fed (FF) infants were used. The levels of several cytokines were measured by direct stimulation of PBMC and by stimulation of a Caco-2/PBMC co-culture with bifidobacteria. B. catenulatum and B. breve were the strongest enhancers of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production by direct stimulation of PBMC. B. longum was the highest inducer of IL-10 and the lowest TNF-alpha stimulus. In the Caco-2/PBMC system, B. breve was the highest inducer of IL-8 production by Caco-2 cells, significantly different from B. infantis, B. adolescentis and the FF mixture (P < 0.05). IFN-gamma produced by PBMC stimulated with the BF mixture (containing 22 % B. breve, compared with 7 % in the FF mixture) was significantly higher compared with B. adolescentis, B. infantis and B. longum. B. adolescentis also inhibited IFN-gamma production compared with the FF mixture and B. longum. The proportion of different Bifidobacterium strains seems to be an important determinant of the cytokine balance in the simulated intestinal environment studied. B. breve and the combination of the Bifidobacterium species typically found in the microbiota of BF infants have shown the most significant effects.
TI  - Fermentation of beta-glucans derived from different sources by bifidobacteria: evaluation of their bifidogenic effect.
AB  - beta-Glucans obtained from barley, seaweed, bacteria, and mushroom sclerotia were incubated with pure cultures of Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium longum, and Bifidobacterium adolescentis for a 24 h batch fermentation to evaluate their bifidogenic effect with inulin as the positive control. The pH value in all culture media was decreased by 0.5-1.5 units. All beta-glucans supported the growth of the three bifidobacteria with B. infantis, having a relatively larger increase in populations (3-4 log(10) colony forming units). B. infantis produced almost double the amount of total short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) than the other two bifidobacteria. The SCFA profile of B. infantis had a relatively higher proportion of propionic and butyric acid but less acetic acid than the other bifidobacteria. The utilization of all the beta-glucans isolated from different sources regardless of their differences in glycosidic linkages and molecular weight by all three bifidobacteria was comparable to that of inulin.
TI  - Role of metabolism by intestinal bacteria in arbutin-induced toxicity in vitro.
AB  - A possible role of metabolism by intestinal bacteria in arbutin-induced toxicity  was investigated in mammalian cell cultures. Following an incubation of arbutin with intestinal bacteria, either Bifidobacterium longum HY81 or Bifidobacterium adolescentis, for 24 h, its aglycone hydroquinone could be produced and detected in the bacterial culture media. The bacterial growth was not affected up to 10 mM arbutin in the culture medium. When the toxicity of bacteria cultured medium with arbutin was tested in the HepG2 cell lines, the medium with arbutin was more toxic than either parent arbutin only or bacteria cultured medium without arbutin, indicating that metabolic activation might be required in arbutin-induced toxicity. In addition, bacteria cultured medium with arbutin could suppress LPS and ConA mitogenicity in splenocyte cultures prepared from normal mice. The results indicate that the present toxicity testing system might be applied for assessing the possible role of metabolism by intestinal bacteria in certain chemical-induced toxicity in mammalian cell cultures.
TI  - Oligosaccharides in 4 different milk groups, Bifidobacteria, and Ruminococcus obeum.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify a link between the total amount of breast milk oligosaccharides and faecal microbiota composition of newborns at the end of the first month of life, with special attention paid to bifidobacteria, and establish the role, if any, of the different oligosaccharides in determining the gut microbiota composition. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Milk oligosaccharide groups were identified by high-performance anion exchange chromatography analysis. DPCRNA from newborns' faecal samples at 30 days of life was isolated and processed by polymerase chain reaction analyses that allow the identification of 6 species of bifidobacteria (adolescentis, bifidum, breve, catenulatum, longum, infantis) and Ruminococcus spp; denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis was also performed. RESULTS: No substantial differences in bifidobacteria species composition within milk groups 1, 2, and 3 were observed; however, infants fed with group 4 milk show a microbiota characterised by a greater frequency of Bifidobacteria adolescentis and the absence of Bifidobacteria catenulatum. For the first time, a high percentage of the Ruminococcus genus in infants fed with all milk groups was found. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that milk groups 1, 2, and 3, containing an amount of oligosaccharides ranging within 10 to 15 g/L, share a substantially identical composition of the intestinal microbiota in breast-fed infants, despite quali-quantitative difference in oligosaccharides content. Newborns taking milk with only 5 g/L of oligosaccharides (group 4) harbour a different intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Bifidobacterial diversity and the development of new microbial source tracking indicators.
AB  - Many studies suggest a close relationship between species of Bifidobacterium and  their hosts. Thus, species such as B. adolescentis and B. thermacidophilum subsp. porcinum have been proposed as potential indicators of human and porcine fecal pollution. The diversity of bifidobacteria in wastewaters (human and animal) and slurries is analyzed using nested PCR followed by denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The sewage samples showed similar DGGE patterns. The predominant bands were recognized as B. adolescentis, B. longum, and two unidentified species related to B. adolescentis. A single band detected in poultry samples was identified as B. saeculare. Bifidobacterial diversity was higher within porcine and bovine samples. The main bands in porcine samples were identified as B. minimum, an unknown species, and B. thermophilum/B. thermacidophilum subsp. porcinum. The latter species was also identified among the main bands in bovine samples together with B. pseudolongum and B. ruminantium. We then attempted to isolate the host-specific strains. DGGE bands were examined to develop specific probes to screen environmental samples by colony hybridization and further isolation of strains from positively hybridized colonies. Bifidobacterial strains that are host associated by DGGE bands to human and pig were successfully isolated from the environment: B. adolescentis from human sewage samples and the unidentified species related to pig from slurries and slaughterhouse wastewater. Neither the poultry-associated B. saeculare nor the ruminant-associated B. pseudolongum could be isolated with the current methodology, suggesting either a low prevalence in the samples or failure of the culture to grow in the media used.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Bifidobacterium spp. isolated from healthy adult Koreans against cariogenic microflora.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dental caries is the main common infectious disease in the human oral  cavity. Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus were reported to be the most important etiological factors in human dental caries. Thus, we examined the inhibitory effects of Bifidobacterium spp. cells and culture supernatants against S. mutans and S. sobrinus, including Streptococcus gordonii, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, which is associated with periodontal disease. METHODS: Mutans streptococci or A. actinomycetemcomitans and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were mixed in 1:1 ratio and then incubated for 90 min at 37 degrees C. After the incubation, the viability of mutans streptococci or A. actinomycetemcomitans was determined by plate count technique. We also investigated the morphological changes of S. mutans treated with LAB using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). RESULTS: In vitro viability of S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. gordonii, and A. actinomycetemcomitans was affected by human intestinal LAB identified as Bifidobacterium adolescentis SPM1005 and Bifidobacterium longum SPM1207. Especially, B. adolescentis SPM1005 cells at 1.0 x 10(8) CFU had a strong growth-inhibiting effect against S. mutans and induced a 64% loss of its viability (p<0.05). In addition, swollen and disrupted S. mutans were observed after incubation with B. adolescentis SPM1005. However, the culture supernatant of this strain did not show such inhibitory activity. CONCLUSION: B. adolescentis SPM1005 cells decreased the growth of S. mutans, which is a risk factor for dental caries. Therefore, we suggest that this Bifidobacterium strain may be a useful probiotic microorganism for prevention of dental caries that does not have adverse effects.
TI  - Predominant genera of fecal microbiota in children with atopic dermatitis are not altered by intake of probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bi-07.
AB  - The effect of probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07 on the composition of the Lactobacillus group, Bifidobacterium and the total bacterial population in feces from young children with atopic dermatitis was investigated. The study included 50 children randomized to intake of one of the probiotic strain or placebo. Microbial composition was characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, quantitative PCR and, in a subset of subjects, by pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The core population of the Lactobacillus group was identified as Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus oris, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, while the bifidobacterial community included Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium catenulatum. The fecal numbers of L. acidophilus and B. lactis increased significantly after intervention, indicating survival of the ingested bacteria. The levels of Bifidobacterium correlated positively (P=0.03), while the levels of the Lactobacillus group negatively (P=0.01) with improvement of atopic eczema evaluated by the Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis index. This correlation was observed across the whole study cohort and not attributed to the probiotic intake. The main conclusion of the study is that administration of L. acidophilus NCFM and B. lactis Bi-07 does not affect the composition and diversity of the main bacterial populations in feces.
TI  - Molecular genetic study of species and strain variability in bifidobacteria population in intestinal microflora of breast-fed infants and their mothers.
AB  - Qualitative and quantitative composition of enteric bifidoflora was studied in a  group of 13 mother-infant pairs. Pure cultures of Bifidobacterium strains were isolated from feces and their species were identified by PCR with species-specific primers or by partial sequencing of 16S rDNA. The strains were compared by REP-PCR. The most incident Bifidobacterium species in mothers were B. longum and B. adolescentis. The infants were mainly colonized by B. bifidum and B. longum. The mother and her baby were colonized by the same Bifidobacterium species in 9 of 13 cases. In 5 (38.5%) of these cases, these pairs of strains were identical by their REP-PCR profiles. These strains belonged to B. longum in one case, B. bifidum in 3 cases, and B. adolescentis in 1 case. Our results support the hypothesis on early colonization of infants with maternal bifidobacterium strains.
TI  - High-throughput method for comparative analysis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles from human fecal samples reveals significant increases in two bifidobacterial species after inulin-type prebiotic intake.
AB  - Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) is one of the most commonly used molecular tools to study complex microbial communities. Despite its widespread use, meaningful interpretative analysis remains a major drawback of this method. We evaluated the combination of computer-assisted band-matching with nonparametric statistics for comparative analysis of DGGE banding patterns. Fecal samples from 17 healthy volunteers who consumed 20 g of the prebiotic compound oligofructose-enriched inulin (OF-IN) for 4 weeks were analyzed before and after treatment. DGGE fingerprinting profiles were analyzed using bionumerics software version 4.6., which resulted in a data matrix that was used for statistical analysis. When comparing DGGE profiles before and after OF-IN intake with a Wilcoxon nonparametric test for paired data, two band-classes increased significantly after OF-IN intake (P<0.003 and <0.02). These two band-classes could be assigned to the species Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium adolescentis by band-sequencing analysis, and their significant increase was quantitatively confirmed with real-time PCR using species-specific primers (respectively P<0.012 and <0.010). Therefore, the nonparametric analysis of a data matrix obtained by computer-assisted band-matching of complex profiles facilitated the interpretative analysis of these profiles and provided an objective and high-throughput method for the detection of significant taxonomic differences in larger numbers of complex profiles.
TI  - The antimicrobial action of low-molar-mass chitosan, chitosan derivatives and chitooligosaccharides on bifidobacteria.
AB  - The crude fractions of chitooligosaccharides (COS) and low-molar-mass chitosans (LMWC) were prepared by enzyme hydrolysis of chitosan (CS). Specific growth rate of B. adolescentis, B. bifidum, B. breve, B. catenulatum, B. infantis and B. longum ssp. longum was determined in the presence of 0.025 and 0.5 % COS (<5 kDa), LMWC (5-10 kDa), and 0.025, 0.1 and 0.5% of CS, chitosan succinate and chitosan glutamate in vitro. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC; assayed by colony counting on TPY agar plates) of COS-LMWC and CS ranged from 0.025% to 0.75% of CS-LMWC. The growth of all bifidobacterial strains in the presence of chitosan, its derivatives and LMWC decreased at a concentration of 0.025%; the bacterial growth was completely inhibited at a concentration of 0.5%. COS did not show any inhibitory effect, an increased growth rate was even observed in the case of B. bifidum, B. catenulatum and B. infantis.
TI  - Dissimilarity in the occurrence of Bifidobacteriaceae in vaginal and perianal microbiota in women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Recent data point at the similarity between the perianal and vaginal microflora in terms of Lactobacillus species involved. Bacterial vaginosis, the most common perturbation of the vaginal microflora involving primarily overgrowth of Gardnerella vaginalis, has also been suggested to involve a recto-vaginal pathway. We addressed this issue with regard to bacteria of the Bifidobacteriaceae family. In particular, we investigated the putative concordance of the presence of G. vaginalis and a series of Bifidobacteria between the perianal and vaginal microflora in 10 patients with bacterial vaginosis through multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of desquamated epithelial cells. G. vaginalis was found in a biofilm mode of growth at the perianal and vaginal sites. In most women at least one of the following species was detected perianally: Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium breves, Bifidobacterium bifidum and Bifidobacterium catenulatum. At the vaginal site, none of these Bifidobacteria was found. We conclude that bacterial vaginosis does not occur as a result of simple growth per continuum of perianal bacteria. Only some species originating from the intestinal tract do display pronounced vaginotropism, like G. vaginalis, whereas many other species do not.
TI  - Amoxicillin treatment modifies the composition of Bifidobacterium species in infant intestinal microbiota.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Amoxicillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic largely used in childhood. However only few studies described its impact on composition of children gut microbiota, in particular on Bifidobacterium populations considered as beneficial microorganisms. In this study, the impact on faecal Bifidobacterium species of a seven-day amoxicillin treatment was quantitatively and qualitatively assessed in infants during an episode of acute respiratory infection. METHODS: Faecal samples from 31 infants were obtained on day 0 (just before amoxicillin therapy) and on day 7 (the end of therapy). Total DNA was extracted and bifidobacteria were quantified using real-time PCR. Predominant Bifidobacterium species were then identified using specific PCR-TTGE. RESULTS: Bifidobacteria concentrations were not significantly altered by amoxicillin compared to the healthy group. However, amoxicillin treatment induced a complete disappearance of Bifidobacterium adolescentis species (occurrence rate of 0% versus 36.4% in healthy group, P < 0.001), a significant decrease in the occurrence rate of Bifidobacterium bifidum (23% versus 54.5% in healthy group, P < 0.05), but did not affect Bifidobacterium longum (93.5% versus 100% in healthy group) and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum/B. catenulatum (about 55% in both groups). The number of Bifidobacterium species per microbiota significantly decreased from 2.5 +/- 1 for healthy group to 1.8 +/- 0.9 for treated infants (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that a 7 day amoxicillin treatment did not alter the counts of Bifidobacterium. However amoxicillin can have an impact by changing the microbiota at the species level and decreased the diversity of this population.
TI  - Diversity of intestinal bifidobacteria in patients with Japanese cedar pollinosis and possible influence of probiotic intervention.
AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the potential association between intestinal bifidobacteria and Japanese cedar pollinosis (JCPsis) and possible influences of probiotic intervention. In this study, fecal samples were the collected from 29 JCPsis patients. The qualitative and quantitative analyses of fecal bifidobacteria were conducted by quantitative real-time PCR with 16S rRNA-gene-targeted species-specific primers before cedar pollen spread and after a 10-week intervention with fermented milk prepared with Lactobacillus GG and L. gasseri TMC0356 during pollen spread. Each JCPsis patient had a unique diversity of bifidobacteria, which varied qualitatively and quantitatively in an individual-dependent manner during pollen spread. The serum IgE concentration of JCPsis patients with more than 3 detectable Bifidobacterium species was significantly lower than that of patients with less than 2 detected species. The prevalence of B. adolescentis, B. longum, and B. catenulatum increased after probiotic intervention, although the changes were not statistically significant. These results suggest that lower diversity of intestinal Bifidobacterium species might be a pathological aspect of JCPsis. The diversity of intestinal bifidobacteria could be a prospective target for using probiotics in the management of IgE-mediated allergic disorders including JCPsis.
TI  - Use of D(acid)-, D(bile)-, z(acid)-, and z(bile)-values in evaluating Bifidobacteria with regard to stomach pH and bile salt sensitivity.
AB  - The survival of bifidobacteria in simulated conditions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract was studied based on the D- and z-value concept. Some Bifidobacterium spp. are probiotics that improve microbial balance in the human GI tract. Because they are sensitive to low pH and bile salt concentrations, their viability in the GI tract is limited. The D- and z-value approach was therefore adopted as a result of observing constant log-cell reduction (90%) when Bifidobacterium spp. were exposed to these 2 different stressing factors. Survivals of one strain each or 4 species of Bifidobacterium was studied at pH between 3.0 and 4.5 and in ox-bile between 0.15% and 0.60% for times up to 41 h. From the D(acid)- and D(bile)-values, the order of resistance to acid and bile was B. bifidum > B. infantis > B. longum > B. adolescentis. While the former 3 strains retained high cell viability at pH 3.5 (>5.5 log CFU/mL after 5 h) and at elevated bile salt concentration of 0.6% (>4.5 log CFU/mL after 3 h), B. adolescentis was less resistant (<3.4 log CFU/mL). The z(acid)- and z(bile)-values calculated from the D(acid)- and D(bile)-values ranged from 1.11 to 1.55 pH units and 0.40% to 0.49%, respectively. The results suggest that the D(acid)-, D(bile)-, z(acid)-, and z(bile)-value approach could be more appropriate than the screening and selection method in evaluating survival of probiotic bacteria, and in measuring their tolerance or resistance to gastric acidity and the associated bile salt concentration in the small intestine. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The evaluation of the tolerance of bifidobacteria to bile salts and low pH has been made possible by use of D- and z-value concept. The calculated z(acid)- and z(bile)-values were all fairly similar for the strains used and suggest the effect of increasing the bile salt concentration or decreasing the pH on the D(acid)- and D(bile)-values. This approach would be useful for predicting the suitability of bifidobacteria and other lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as probiotics for use in real-life situations.
TI  - Characterization of recombinant beta-fructofuranosidase from Bifidobacterium adolescentis G1.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We have previously reported on purification and characterization of beta-fructofuranosidase (beta-FFase) from Bifidobacterium adolescentis G1. This enzyme showed high activity of hydrolysis on fructo-oligosaccharides with a low degree of polymerization. Recently, genome sequences of B. longum NCC2705 and B. adolescentis ATCC 15703 were determined, and cscA gene in the both genome sequences encoding beta-FFase was predicted. Here, cloning of cscA gene encoding putative beta-FFase from B. adolescentis G1, its expression in E. coli and properties of the recombinant protein are described. RESULTS: Using the information of cscA gene from Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15703, cscA gene from B. adolescentis G1 was cloned and sequenced. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of purified beta-FFase from B. adolescentis G1 was identical to the deduced amino acid sequences of cscA gene from B. adolescentis G1. To confirm the translated product of the cscA gene, the recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli. Molecular mass of the purified recombinant enzyme was estimated to be about 66,000 by SDS-PAGE and 60,300 by MALDI TOF-MS. The optimum pH of the enzyme was 5.7 and the enzyme was stable at pH 5.0-8.6. The thermostability of the enzyme was up to 50 degrees C. The K(m) (mM), Vmax (micromol/mg of protein/min), k0 (sec(-1)) and k0/K(m)(mM(-1) sec(-1)) for 1-kestose, neokestose, nystose, fructosylnystose, sucrose and inulin were 1.7, 107, 107.5, 63.2, and 1.7, 142, 142.7, 83.9, and 3.9, 152, 152.8, 39.2, and 2.2, 75, 75.4, 34.3, and 38, 79, 79.4, 2.1, and 25.9, 77, 77.4, 3.0, respectively. The hydrolytic activity was strongly inhibited by AgNO3, SDS, and HgCl2. CONCLUSION: The recombinant enzyme had similar specificity to the native enzyme, high affinity for 1-kestose, and low affinity for sucrose and inulin, although properties of the recombinant enzyme showed slight difference from those of the native one previously described.
TI  - Distribution of in vitro fermentation ability of lacto-N-biose I, a major building block of human milk oligosaccharides, in bifidobacterial strains.
AB  - This study investigated the potential utilization of lacto-N-biose I (LNB) by individual strains of bifidobacteria. LNB is a building block for the human milk oligosaccharides, which have been suggested to be a factor for selective growth of bifidobacteria. A total of 208 strains comprising 10 species and 4 subspecies were analyzed for the presence of the galacto-N-biose/lacto-N-biose I phosphorylase (GLNBP) gene (lnpA) and examined for growth when LNB was used as the sole carbohydrate source. While all strains of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, B. longum subsp. infantis, B. breve, and B. bifidum were able to grow on LNB, none of the strains of B. adolescentis, B. catenulatum, B. dentium, B. angulatum, B. animalis subsp. lactis, and B. thermophilum showed any growth. In addition, some strains of B. pseudocatenulatum, B. animalis subsp. animalis, and B. pseudolongum exhibited the ability to utilize LNB. With the exception for B. pseudocatenulatum, the presence of lnpA coincided with LNB utilization in almost all strains. These results indicate that bifidobacterial species, which are the predominant species found in infant intestines, are potential utilizers of LNB. These findings support the hypothesis that GLNBP plays a key role in the colonization of bifidobacteria in the infant intestine.
TI  - [Influence of bifidobacteria on antilysozyme activity of microorganisms and their ability to form biofilms].
AB  - AIM: To assess influence of bifidobacteria's exometabolites on expression of antilysozyme activity of microflora and its ability to biofilm formation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six strains of bifidobacteria belonging to B. longum, B. bifidum, and B. adolescentis as well as 42 strains of opportunistic microorganisms belonging to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and Rhodotorula rubra isolated by conventional methods during assessment of intestinal microbiocenosis in humans. In order to study the influence of bifidoflora's exometabolites on associative flora, obtained filtrates were mixed with nutrient broth in 1:10 ratio with subsequent introduction of pure culture of opportunistic microorganism. Nutritional broth was used instead of filtrates of bifidobacteria for obtaining the control samples. Formation of biofilms was determined on the ability of strains of microorganisms to adhere on the surface of 96-well polystyrene plate, whereas the antilysozyme activity was studied by photometric method. RESULTS: Performed studies revealed multidirectional but mostly inhibiting effect of bifidobacteria's metabolites on antilysozyme activity of opportunistic microorganisms and their ability to form biofilms. Changes of these characteristics was observed both in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as in yeast fungi and depended from species of bifidobacteria and associative opportunistic microflora. CONCLUSION: Obtained data open perspective for search of control on infectious process on the basis of modification of persistence characteristics of associative pathogens and their ability to form biofilms in host's biotope.
TI  - Oral administration of live Bifidobacterium substrains isolated from centenarians enhances intestinal function in mice.
AB  - We studied the effects of two bifidobacteria strains isolated from healthy centenarians on intestinal function in mice. Bifidobacterium adolescentis BBMN23 and Bifidobacterium longum BBMN68 were orally administrated to specific pathogen-free BALB/c mice at different doses (2 x 10(11), 2 x 10(9), or 2 x 10(7) CFU/kg body weight) each day for 4 weeks. Villus height, crypt depth, villus width, and villus/crypt ratio (V/C) were determined. The content of duodenal secreted immunoglobulin A (sIgA) was also evaluated. There were clear increases in height and width of duodenal villi in both treated groups. Crypt depths were deeper in animals treated with BBMN23 than in controls, while depths were reduced in animals receiving BBMN68. The V/C ratio was increased after feeding with BBMN68, while BBMN23 had no significant effect. Both strains improved the sIgA content of the duodenum. These results suggest that BBMN23 and BBMN68 may improve intestinal digestion and ability and enhance immune barrier function in the intestine.
TI  - In vitro fermentation of arabinoxylan-derived carbohydrates by bifidobacteria and mixed fecal microbiota.
AB  - Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15703, Bifidobacterium breve ATCC 15700, Bifidobacterium longum ATCC 15707, and human fecal microbiota were cultivated in vitro with d-xylose, l-arabinose, xylo-oligosaccharides (XOS), and arabinoxylo-oligosaccharides (AXOS) as carbon sources. The pH, formation of volatile fatty acids, and carbohydrate utilization profiles were followed. In the pure bifidobacteria cultures optical density and in the fecal slurries pressure and H(2) were also detected. A differing substrate preference was observed among the various bifidobacteria strains. B. adolescentis grew on XOS, slowly on d-xylose, but not on l-arabinose. In contrast, B. longum preferred l-arabinose and did not grow on pure d-xylose or XOS. Both strains were able to utilize AXOS but with differing strategies, since after the cleavage of l-arabinose B. adolescentis consumed the XOS formed, whereas B. longum fermented the l-arabinose released. B. breve grew poorly on all of the substrates provided. A bifidobacterial mixture and the fecal microbiota were able to utilize pure singly substituted AXOS almost completely, but pure AXOS with a doubly substituted xylose residue was fermented only by the fecal microbiota. Thus, AXOS appear to be potential candidates for slowly fermenting prebiotics, but their prebiotic effects may be dependent on the type of arabinose substitution and the presence of other carbohydrates.
TI  - [Species characteristic and factors of persistence of gut bifidoflora during healthy state and dysbiosis].
AB  - AIM: To determine features of species composition and factors of persistence of bifidobacteria of human gut microflora in healthy state and during dysbiosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Strains of bifidobacteria isolated from feces of patients with gut dysbiosis grades I - III (24 participants) and conditionally healthy persons (14 participants) were used for the study. Isolation and identification of microorganisms were performed by conventional methods. Antilysozyme activity was determined by photometric method and antilactoferrin sign--by immunoenzyme assay. RESULTS: Bifidobacteria isolated from intestinal biotope have differences in species composition, which depended from age and state of microbiocenosis of studied persons. Bifidobacterium bifidum was dominated between strains of bifidobacteria isolated from infants with eubiosis, whereas B. longum dominated in persons > 1 y.o. B. bifidum and B. adolescentis were mainly isolated in infants with gut dysbiosis, where as in children > 1 y.o. B. adolescentis was predominantly isolated. New characteristic of bifidoflora--antilactoferrin activity--was discovered for the first time. Expression of this sign, as well as antilysozyme activity, varied and depended from species of bifidobacteria. CONCLUSION: Obtained data widen our views on species composition of bifidobacteria and discover possible mechanisms of persistence of these microorganisms in intestinal biotope associated with inactivation of host defense factors--lysozyme and lactoferrin.
TI  - [Screening and identification of probiotic bifidobacterium from Mongolian children].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bifidobacterium has important physiological activity in gastrointestinal tract of human and animals, and the tolerability of acid, intestinal juice and oxgall bile salt are the key factors that influence the function of living bacteria preparation. In this study, feces of 12 healthy Mongolian children were selected to isolate Bifidobacterium with probiotic properties. METHODS: Bifidobacterium was isolated from feces by selective medium and identified by physiological biochemical test. The tolerability of acid, intestinal juice and oxgall bile salt of 11 Bfidobacteria were studied and B. animalis V9 was identified further by molecular biological approach 16S rDNA. RESULTS: Eleven Bifidobacteria isolated from feces of 12 healthy Mongolian children were identified as B. adolescentis (A1, H3, G4, A8 and V10), B. longum (C6, C7 and D11), B. pseudocatenlatum (B2), B. bifidum (G5), B. animalis (V9). B. animalis V9 had the best acid tolerance with the survival rate 92.4% in artificial gastric juice at pH2.0 for 3h, whereas others had lower than 31.25%. B. animalis V9 also had good survival rate (99.7%) in artificial intestinal juice at pH8.0 for 8h after anaerobic cultured 3h in artificial gastric juice at pH2.0, and tolerated oxgall bile salt at concentration of 0.3%. B. animalis V9 was identified further by molecular biological approach 16S rDNA and result showed the homologies of B. animalis V9 was 99% with Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactic BB12. CONCLUSION: B. animalis V9 had good probiotic properties to be potentiallyused in dairy products and health products.
TI  - Oral administration of live Bifidobacterium substrains isolated from healthy centenarians enhanced immune function in BALB/c mice.
AB  - Generally, there is an age-related decline in the human gut titer of Bifidobacterium species, but the titer in healthy centenarians was previously reported to be comparable to that found in much younger people. We addressed whether elevated Bifidobacterium titers relate positively to immune function. This study evaluated the immunoactivities of 2 Bifidobacterium strains (B adolescentis BBMN23 and B longum BBMN68) isolated from healthy centenarians in China. Different dosages (2 x 10(11), 2 x 10(9), or 2 x 10(7) colony-forming units [CFU]/kg body weight) of live bifidobacteria were orally administered once per day to healthy BALB/c mice, and the control group was given sterile skim milk every day. After 4 weeks, the immune parameters including cellular immunity (delayed-type hypersensitivity [DTH], and splenic lymphocyte proliferation), humoral immunity (serum hemolytic activity in immunized animals), and nonspecific immunity (peritoneal macrophages phagocytsis natural killer [NK] cell activity) were measured. We report that both Bifidobacterium strains independently increased the DTH response. Macrophage phagocytosis was also enhanced, while activities of the NK cells and levels of the serum hemolysin also were significantly higher than in the control group. There was a significant increase in splenic lymphocyte proliferation in bifidobacteria treatment animals compared to controls. In conclusion, ingestion of B. adolescentis BBMN23 and B. longum BBMN68 can enhance both innate and acquired immunity in healthy specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice and strains of bifidobacteria from healthy centenarians in Bama longevity villages in China may possess potentially valuable immunomodulatory properties.
TI  - A versatile and scalable strategy for glycoprofiling bifidobacterial consumption  of human milk oligosaccharides.
AB  - Human milk contains approximately 200 complex oligosaccharides believed to stimulate the growth and establishment of a protective microbiota in the infant gut. The lack of scalable analytical techniques has hindered the measurement of bacterial metabolism of these and other complex prebiotic oligosaccharides. An in vitro, multi-strain, assay capable of measuring kinetics of bacterial growth and detailed oligosaccharide consumption analysis by FTICR-MS was developed and tested simultaneously on 12 bifidobacterial strains. For quantitative consumption, deuterated and reduced human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) standards were used. A custom software suite developed in house called Glycolyzer was used to process the large amounts of oligosaccharide mass spectra automatically with (13)C corrections based on de-isotoping protocols. High growth on HMOs was characteristic of Bifidobacterium longum biovar infantis strains, which consumed nearly all available substrates, while other bifidobacterial strains tested, B. longum bv. longum, B. adolescentis, B. breve and B. bifidum, showed low or only moderate growth ability. Total oligosaccharide consumption ranged from a high of 87% for B. infantis JCM 7009 to only 12% for B. adolescentis ATCC 15703. A detailed analysis of consumption glycoprofiles indicated strain-specific capabilities towards differential metabolism of milk oligosaccharides. This method overcomes previous limitations in the quantitative, multi-strain analysis of bacterial metabolism of HMOs and represents a novel approach towards understanding bacterial consumption of complex prebiotic oligosaccharides.
TI  - Interplay between weight loss and gut microbiota composition in overweight adolescents.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the influence of an obesity treatment program on the gut microbiota and body weight of overweight adolescents. Thirty-six adolescents (13-15 years), classified as overweight according to the International Obesity Task Force BMI criteria, were submitted to a calorie-restricted diet (10-40%) and increased physical activity (15-23 kcal/kg body weight/week) program over 10 weeks. Gut bacterial groups were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR before and after the intervention. A group of subjects (n=23) experienced >4.0 kg weight loss and showed significant BMI (P=0.030) and BMI z-score (P=0.035) reductions after the intervention, while the other group (n=13) showed <2.0 kg weight loss. No significant differences in dietary intake were found between both groups. In the whole adolescent population, the intervention led to increased Bacteroides fragilis group (P=0.001) and Lactobacillus group (P=0.030) counts, and to decreased Clostridium coccoides group (P=0.028), Bifidobacterium longum (P=0.031), and Bifidobacterium adolescentis (P=0.044) counts. In the high weight-loss group, B. fragilis group and Lactobacillus group counts also increased (P=0.001 and P=0.007, respectively), whereas C. coccoides group and B. longum counts decreased (P=0.001 and P=0.044, respectively) after the intervention. Total bacteria, B. fragilis group and Clostridium leptum group, and Bifidobacterium catenulatum group counts were significantly higher (P<0.001-0.036) while levels of C. coccoides group, Lactobacillus group, Bifidobacterium, Bifidobacterium breve, and Bifidobacterium bifidum were significantly lower (P<0.001-0.008) in the high weight-loss group than in the low weight-loss group before and after the intervention. These findings indicate that calorie restriction and physical activity have an impact on gut microbiota composition related to body weight loss, which also seem to be influenced by the individual's microbiota.
TI  - Anti-inflammatory effects of the genus Bifidobacterium on macrophages by modification of phospho-I kappaB and SOCS gene expression.
AB  - Although beneficial roles of probiotics for inflammatory bowel diseases have been reported, their direct action on immune cells has not been elucidated. In this study, we investigated how three species of Bifidobacterium and Enterococcus faecalis differentially modulate production of cytokines from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages in vitro using RAW264.7 cells. The mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines were remarkably increased after exposure to LPS, E. faecalis alone and LPS combined with E. faecalis. In contrast, IL-10 mRNA levels were significantly decreased after exposure to E. faecalis compared with exposure to Bifidobacterium species. When cells were exposed to Bifidobacterium species combined with LPS, mRNA levels of IL12p40 were decreased by co-culture with B. breve and B. longum, IL-1 beta mRNA levels were decreased by B. breve and B. adorescentis and TNF-alpha mRNA levels were decreased by B. adolescentis compared with LPS alone. The three species of Bifidobacterium significantly inhibited phosphorylation of I kappaB-alpha induced by LPS. The mRNA levels of SOCS1 and SOCS3 were increased by exposure to LPS alone; however, the mRNA levels of SOCS1 or SOCS3 were increased more by exposure to Bifidobacterium species combined with LPS. Conversely, E. faecalis combined with LPS induced significantly lower levels of SOCS mRNA than those induced by Bifidobacterium species combined with LPS. These results indicated that certain species of genus Bifidobacterium could negatively modulate mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines produced from LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, which is possibly related to inhibition of I kappaB-alpha phosphorylation and stimulation of SOCS signalling.
TI  - Coculture fermentations of Bifidobacterium species and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron reveal a mechanistic insight into the prebiotic effect of inulin-type fructans.
AB  - Four bifidobacteria, each representing a cluster of strains with specific inulin-type-fructan degradation capacities, were grown in coculture fermentations with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron LMG 11262, a strain able to metabolize both oligofructose and inulin. In a medium for colon bacteria with inulin as the sole added energy source, the ability of the bifidobacteria to compete for this substrate reflected phenotypical variation. Bifidobacterium breve Yakult, a strain that was not able to degrade oligofructose or inulin, was outcompeted by B. thetaiotaomicron LMG 11262. Bifidobacterium adolescentis LMG 10734, a strain that could degrade oligofructose (displaying a preferential breakdown mechanism) but that did not grow on inulin, managed to become competitive when oligofructose and short fractions of inulin started to accumulate in the fermentation medium. Bifidobacterium angulatum LMG 11039(T), a strain that was previously shown to degrade all oligofructose fractions simultaneously and to be able to partially break down inulin, was competitive from the beginning of the fermentation, consuming short fractions of inulin from the moment they appeared. Bifidobacterium longum LMG 11047, representing a cluster of bifidobacteria that shared both high fructose consumption and oligofructose degradation rates and were able to perform partial breakdown of inulin, was the dominating strain in a coculture with B. thetaiotaomicron LMG 11262. These observations indicate that distinct subgroups within the large-intestinal Bifidobacterium population will be stimulated by different groups of prebiotic inulin-type fructans, a variation that could be reflected in differences concerning their health-promoting effects.
TI  - Hierarchical oligonucleotide primer extension as a time- and cost-effective approach for quantitative determination of Bifidobacterium spp. in infant feces.
AB  - The Bifidobacterium spp. present in 10 infant fecal samples (4 from infants with  eczema and 6 from healthy infants) were quantified with both hierarchical oligonucleotide primer extension (HOPE) and fluorescence in situ hybridization-flow cytometry. The relative abundances of Bifidobacterium longum and B. catenulatum with respect to the total bifidobacteria had a poor correlation (rho, <0.600; P value, >0.208), presumably due to differences in primer specificity and the level of hybridization stringency of both methods. In contrast, the relative abundances of organisms of the genus Bifidobacterium against the total amplified 16S rRNA genes and those of B. adolescentis, B. bifidum, and B. breve against the genus Bifidobacterium exhibited a good statistical correlation (rho, >0.783; P value, <0.066). This good comparability supports HOPE as a method to achieve high-throughput quantitative determination of bacterial targets in a time- and cost-effective manner.
TI  - Exploring the diversity of the bifidobacterial population in the human intestinal tract.
AB  - Although the health-promoting roles of bifidobacteria are widely accepted, the diversity of bifidobacteria among the human intestinal microbiota is still poorly understood. We performed a census of bifidobacterial populations from human intestinal mucosal and fecal samples by plating them on selective medium, coupled with molecular analysis of selected rRNA gene sequences (16S rRNA gene and internally transcribed spacer [ITS] 16S-23S spacer sequences) of isolated colonies. A total of 900 isolates were collected, of which 704 were shown to belong to bifidobacteria. Analyses showed that the culturable bifidobacterial population from intestinal and fecal samples include six main phylogenetic taxa, i.e., Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, Bifidobacterium breve, and Bifidobacterium bifidum, and two species mostly detected in fecal samples, i.e., Bifidobacterium dentium and Bifidobacterium animalis subp. lactis. Analysis of bifidobacterial distribution based on age of the subject revealed that certain identified bifidobacterial species were exclusively present in the adult human gut microbiota whereas others were found to be widely distributed. We encountered significant intersubject variability and composition differences between fecal and mucosa-adherent bifidobacterial communities. In contrast, a modest diversification of bifidobacterial populations was noticed between different intestinal regions within the same individual (intrasubject variability). Notably, a small number of bifidobacterial isolates were shown to display a wide ecological distribution, thus suggesting that they possess a broad colonization capacity.
TI  - A Bifidobacterium mixed-species microarray for high resolution discrimination between intestinal bifidobacteria.
AB  - A genomic DNA-based microarray was constructed containing over 6000 randomly cloned genomic fragments of approximately 1-2 kb from six mammalian intestinal Bifidobacterium spp. including B. adolescentis, B. animalis, B. bifidum, B. catenulatum, B. longum and B. pseudolongum. This Bifidobacterium Mixed-Species (BMS) microarray was used to differentiate between type strains and isolates belonging to a set of nine Bifidobacterium spp. Hierarchical clustering of genomic hybridization data confirmed the grouping of the Bifidobacterium spp. according to the 16S rRNA-based phylogenetic clusters. In addition, these genomic hybridization experiments revealed high homology between the type-strain B. animalis subsp. lactis LMG18314 and B. animalis subsp. animalis LMG10508 (79%) as well as between the type strains B. longum biotype longum LMG13197 and B. longum biotype infantis LMG8811 (72%) - nevertheless, discrimination between these species was possible due to the high resolution output of the BMS-array. In addition, it was shown that the BMS-array could be used for assigning unknown Bifidobacterium isolates to a species group. Finally, a set of 54 diagnostic clones for Bifidobacterium identification was selected and sequenced to advance the understanding of the species-related differences. Remarkably, a large fraction (31%) of these was predicted to encode proteins that belong to the bifidobacterial glycobiome and another 11% had functional homology with genes involved in the protection against foreign DNA. Overall, the BMS-microarray is a high-resolution diagnostic tool that is able to facilitate the detection of strain- and species-specific characteristics of bifidobacteria.
TI  - Isolation of bifidobacteria from breast milk and assessment of the bifidobacterial population by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitative real-time PCR.
AB  - The objective of this work was to elucidate if breast milk contains bifidobacteria and whether they can be transmitted to the infant gut through breastfeeding. Twenty-three women and their respective infants provided samples of breast milk and feces, respectively, at days 4 to 7 after birth. Gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates from specific media with typical bifidobacterial shapes were identified to the genus level by F6PPK (fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase) assays and to the species level by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Bifidobacterial communities in breast milk were assessed by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), and their levels were estimated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRTi-PCR). Bifidobacteria were present in 8 milk samples and 21 fecal samples. Bifidobacterium breve, B. adolescentis, and B. bifidum were isolated from milk samples, while infant feces also contained B. longum and B. pseudocatenulatum. PCR-DGGE revealed the presence of one to four dominant bifidobacterial bands in 22 milk samples. Sequences with similarities above 98% were identified as Bifidobacterium breve, B. adolescentis, B. longum, B. bifidum, and B. dentium. Bifidobacterial DNA was detected by qRTi-PCR in the same 22 milk samples at a range between 40 and 10,000 16S rRNA gene copies per ml. In conclusion, human milk seems to be a source of living bifidobacteria for the infant gut.
TI  - Comparison of intestinal microflora in healthy infants and infants with allergic  colitis.
AB  - Twenty-eight exclusively breast-fed healthy infants and 16 infants also exclusively breast-fed with allergic colitis (aged 85 +/- 60 and 98 +/- 58 d, respectively) were screened for differences in fecal flora. Bifidobacteria were detected in 23 healthy infants and only in 4 fecal samples of infants with allergic colitis. All bifidobacteria-free infants possessed Gram-positive regular rods as a major group of their fecal flora. These bacteria were identified as clostridia using genus-specific FISH probe. Infants with allergy colitis possessed significantly lower counts of bifidobacteria and total anaerobes and significantly higher counts of clostridia in their feces. In healthy infants, Bifidobacterium longum was the most frequently found species (54.5% of the samples), followed by B. adolescentis (20.0), B. breve (18.2), B. bifidum (16.4), B. dentium (10.9) and B. pseudocatenulatum (1.80). Bifidobacterial isolates from two babies with allergic colitis were identified as B. longum, one child from patients group contained species B. dentium and one baby B. adolescentis. Our results suggest that there are significantly lower counts of bifidobacteria in infants with allergic colitis than in healthy infants.
TI  - Assessment on the fermentability of xylooligosaccharides from rice husks by probiotic bacteria.
AB  - Liquors from rice husk autohydrolysis, containing xylooligosaccharides (XOS), other saccharides, and nonsaccharide compounds, were refined by membrane processing to increase the proportion of substituted XOS in refined liquors. XOS were assayed for composition and degree of polymerization (DP) distribution and hydrolyzed with commercial enzymes for obtaining XOS with DP in the range of 2-6. Nanofiltered, hydrolyzed liquors were subjected to ion exchange processing to yield a final product containing monosaccharides, XOS (accounting for 55.6% of the nonvolatile solutes), and other nonvolatile compounds. The solution obtained after enzymatic hydrolysis with commercial xylanases (in which 82.8% of XOS were in the DP range of 2-6) was examined as a medium for promoting the growth of Bifidobacterium adolescentis CECT 5781, B. longum CECT 4503, B. infantis CECT 4551, and B. breve CECT 4839. The growth rate of B. adolescentis (0.58 h(-1)) was higher than the ones determined for B. longum, B. infantis, and B. breve (0.37, 0.30, and 0.40 h(-1), respectively). The percentage of total XOS consumption by B. adolescentis was 77% after 24 h, the highest percentage of utilization corresponding to xylotriose (90%), followed by xylobiose (84%), xylotetraose (83%), and xylopentaose (71%).
TI  - Effect of inulin on the human gut microbiota: stimulation of Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii.
AB  - Prebiotics are food ingredients that improve health by modulating the colonic microbiota. The bifidogenic effect of the prebiotic inulin is well established; however, it remains unclear which species of Bifidobacterium are stimulated in vivo and whether bacterial groups other than lactic acid bacteria are affected by inulin consumption. Changes in the faecal microbiota composition were examined by real-time PCR in twelve human volunteers after ingestion of inulin (10 g/d) for a 16-d period in comparison with a control period without any supplement intake. The prevalence of most bacterial groups examined did not change after inulin intake, although the low G+C % Gram-positive species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii exhibited a significant increase (10.3% for control period v. 14.5% during inulin intake, P=0.019). The composition of the genus Bifidobacterium was studied in four of the volunteers by clone library analysis. Between three and five Bifidobacterium spp. were found in each volunteer. Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Bifidobacterium longum were present in all volunteers, and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, Bifidobacterium animalis, Bifidobacterium bifidum and Bifidobacterium dentium were also detected. Real-time PCR was employed to quantify the four most prevalent Bifidobacterium spp., B. adolescentis, B. longum, B. pseudocatenulatum and B. bifidum, in ten volunteers carrying detectable levels of bifidobacteria. B. adolescentis showed the strongest response to inulin consumption, increasing from 0.89 to 3.9% of the total microbiota (P=0.001). B. bifidum was increased from 0.22 to 0.63% (P<0.001) for the five volunteers for whom this species was present.
TI  - Bifidobacterium microbiota and parameters of immune function in elderly subjects.
AB  - Faecal and serum samples were collected over a period of 6 months from 55 institutionalized elderly subjects, who were enrolled in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. Participants were randomized in one of the three treatment groups: intervention (two probiotic Bifidobacterium longum strains: 2C and 46), placebo and commercial control (Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12). The faecal Bifidobacterium microbiota was characterized by genus and species-specific PCR. Serum levels of the cytokines IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Each participant harboured on average approximately three different bifidobacterial species. The most frequently detected species were B. longum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Bifidobacterium bifidum. Depending on the treatment, the intervention resulted in specific changes in the levels of certain Bifidobacterium species, and positive correlations were found between the different species. Negative correlations were observed between the levels of Bifidobacterium species and the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha and the regulatory cytokine IL-10. The presence of faecal B. longum and Bifidobacterium animalis correlated with reduced serum IL-10. The anti-inflammatory TGF-beta1 levels were increased over time in all three groups, and the presence of Bifidobacterium breve correlated with higher serum TGF-beta1 levels. This indicates that modulation of the faecal Bifidobacterium microbiota may provide a means of influencing inflammatory responses.
TI  - Evaluation of the PCR method for identification of Bifidobacterium species.
AB  - AIMS: Bifidobacterium species are known for their beneficial effects on health and their wide use as probiotics. Although various polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods for the identification of Bifidobacterium species have been published, the reliability of these methods remains open to question. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we evaluated 37 previously reported PCR primer sets designed to amplify 16S rDNA, 23S rDNA, intergenic spacer regions, or repetitive DNA sequences of various Bifidobacterium species. CONCLUSIONS: Ten of 37 experimental primer sets showed specificity for B. adolescentis, B. angulatum, B. pseudocatenulatum, B. breve, B. bifidum, B. longum, B. longum biovar infantis and B. dentium. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results suggest that published Bifidobacterium primer sets should be re-evaluated for both reproducibility and specificity for the identification of Bifidobacterium species using PCR. Improvement of existing PCR methods will be needed to facilitate identification of other Bifidobacterium strains, such as B. animalis, B. catenulatum, B. thermophilum and B. subtile.
TI  - Gnotobiotic mouse immune response induced by Bifidobacterium sp. strains isolated from infants.
AB  - Bifidobacterium, which is a dominant genus in infants' fecal flora and can be used as a probiotic, has shown beneficial effects in various pathologies, including allergic diseases, but its role in immunity has so far been little known. Numerous studies have shown the crucial role of the initial intestinal colonization in the development of the intestinal immune system, and bifidobacteria could play a major role in this process. For a better understanding of the effect of Bifidobacterium on the immune system, we aimed at determining the impact of Bifidobacterium on the T-helper 1 (T(H)1)/T(H)2 balance by using gnotobiotic mice. Germfree mice were inoculated with Bifidobacterium longum NCC2705, whose genome is sequenced, and with nine Bifidobacterium strains isolated from infants' fecal flora. Five days after inoculation, mice were killed. Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-10, and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) gene expressions in the ileum and IFN-gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-10, IL-4, and IL-5 secretions by splenocytes cultivated for 48 h with concanavalin A were quantified. Two Bifidobacterium species had no effect (B. adolescentis) or little effect (B. breve) on the immune system. Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium dentium, and one B. longum strain induced T(H)1 and T(H)2 cytokines at the systemic and intestinal levels. One B. longum strain induced a T(H)2 orientation with high levels of IL-4 and IL-10, both secreted by splenocytes, and of TGF-beta gene expression in the ileum. The other two strains induced T(H)1 orientations with high levels of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha splenocyte secretions. Bifidobacterium's capacity to stimulate immunity is species specific, but its influence on the orientation of the immune system is strain specific.
TI  - Bifidobacterium carbohydrases-their role in breakdown and synthesis of (potential) prebiotics.
AB  - There is an increasing interest to positively influence the human intestinal microbiota through the diet by the use of prebiotics and/or probiotics. It is anticipated that this will balance the microbial composition in the gastrointestinal tract in favor of health promoting genera such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. Carbohydrates like non-digestible oligosaccharides are potential prebiotics. To understand how these bacteria can grow on these carbon sources, knowledge of the carbohydrate-modifying enzymes is needed. Little is known about the carbohydrate-modifying enzymes of bifidobacteria. The genome sequence of Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Bifidobacterium longum biotype longum has been completed and it was observed that for B. longum biotype longum more than 8% of the annotated genes were involved in carbohydrate metabolism. In addition more sequence data of individual carbohydrases from other Bifidobacterium spp. became available. Besides the degradation of (potential) prebiotics by bifidobacterial glycoside hydrolases, we will focus in this review on the possibilities to produce new classes of non-digestible oligosaccharides by showing the presence and (transglycosylation) activity of the most important carbohydrate modifying enzymes in bifidobacteria. Approaches to use and improve carbohydrate-modifying enzymes in prebiotic design will be discussed.
TI  - Bifidobacteria in feces and environmental waters.
AB  - Bifidobacteria have been recommended as potential indicators of human fecal pollution in surface waters even though very little is known about their presence in nonhuman fecal sources. The objective of this research was to shed light on the occurrence and molecular diversity of this fecal indicator group in different animals and environmental waters. Genus- and species-specific 16S rRNA gene PCR assays were used to study the presence of bifidobacteria among 269 fecal DNA extracts from 32 different animals. Twelve samples from three wastewater treatment plants and 34 water samples from two fecally impacted watersheds were also tested. The species-specific assays showed that Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B. bifidum, B. dentium, and B. catenulatum had the broadest host distribution (11.9 to 17.4%), whereas B. breve, B. infantis, and B. longum were detected in fewer than 3% of all fecal samples. Phylogenetic analysis of 356 bifidobacterial clones obtained from different animal feces showed that ca. 67% of all of the sequences clustered with cultured bifidobacteria, while the rest formed a supercluster with low sequence identity (i.e., <94%) to previously described Bifidobacterium spp. The B. pseudolongum subcluster (>97% similarity) contained 53 fecal sequences from seven different animal hosts, suggesting the cosmopolitan distribution of members of this clade. In contrast, two clades containing B. thermophilum and B. boum clustered exclusively with 37 and 18 pig fecal clones, respectively, suggesting host specificity. Using species-specific assays, bifidobacteria were detected in only two of the surface water DNA extracts, although other fecal anaerobic bacteria were detected in these waters. Overall, the results suggest that the use of bifidobacterial species as potential markers to monitor human fecal pollution in natural waters may be questionable.
TI  - In vitro fermentability of human milk oligosaccharides by several strains of bifidobacteria.
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the catabolism and fermentation of human  milk oligosaccharides (HMO) by individual strains of bifidobacteria. Oligosaccharides were isolated from a pooled sample of human milk using solid-phase extraction, and then added to a growth medium as the sole source of fermentable carbohydrate. Of five strains of bifidobacteria tested (Bifidobacterium longum biovar infantis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum biovar longum, Bifidobacterium breve, and Bifidobacterium adolescentis), B. longum bv. infantis grew better, achieving triple the cell density then the other strains. B. bifidum did not reach a high cell density, yet generated free sialic acid, fucose and N-acetylglucosamine in the media, suggesting some capacity for HMO degradation. Thin layer chromatography profiles of spent fermentation broth suggests substantial degradation of oligosaccharides by B. longum bv. infantis, moderate degradation by B. bifidum and little degradation by other strains. While all strains were able to individually ferment two monosaccharide constituents of HMO, glucose and galactose, only B. longum bv. infantis and B. breve were able to ferment glucosamine, fucose and sialic acid. These results suggest that as a potential prebiotic, HMO may selectively promote the growth of certain bifidobacteria strains, and their catabolism may result in free monosaccharides in the colonic lumen.
TI  - Reduction of vitamin K concentration by salivary Bifidobacterium strains and their possible nutritional competition with Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - AIMS: To assess the possibility that bifidobacteria compete with Porphyromonas gingivalis for their mutual growth factor vitamin K. This study also examined whether salivary Bifidobacterium species decrease vitamin K concentration in the growth medium. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty-five strains of Bifidobacterium were obtained from 20 of 24 periodontally healthy subjects. Bifidobacterium dentium was most frequently detected in the saliva of subjects, followed by Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium longum, and Bifidobacterium urinalis. The growth of most Bifidobacterium isolates, except that of B. urinalis, was stimulated by vitamin K. Moreover, the isolates were capable of decreasing vitamin K after incubation, which suggests that bifidobacteria compete with P. gingivalis for vitamin K. In a co-culture, a representative strain -B. adolescentis S2-1 - inhibited the growth of P. gingivalis if it was inoculated in the medium before P. gingivalis. CONCLUSIONS: B. adolescentis S2-1 decreased vitamin K concentration and inhibited the growth of P. gingivalis by possibly competing for the growth factor. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Salivary bifidobacteria may possess the potential to suppress the growth of P. gingivalis by reducing the growth factor(s) in the environment.
TI  - Maternal breast-milk and intestinal bifidobacteria guide the compositional development of the Bifidobacterium microbiota in infants at risk of allergic disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The sources and the impact of maternal bacteria on the initial inoculum of the intestinal microflora of newborn infants remain elusive. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between maternal breast-milk and fecal bifidobacteria and infants' fecal bifidobacteria. METHODS: Sixty-one mother-infant pairs were included, special emphasis being placed on the maternal allergic status. Bifidobacteria were analysed by a direct PCR method in fecal samples from mothers at 30-35 weeks of gestation and from infants at 1 month of age and from breast-milk samples 1 month post-partum. RESULTS: Fecal Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Bifidobacterium bifidum colonization frequencies and counts among mother-infant pairs correlated significantly (P=0.005 and 0.02 for frequencies, respectively, and P=0.002 and 0.01 for counts, respectively). Only infants of allergic, atopic mothers were colonized with B. adolescentis. Each of the breast-milk samples contained bifidobacteria [median 1.4 x 10(3) bacterial cells/mL; interquartile range (IQR) 48.7-3.8 x 10(3)]. Bifidobacterium longum was the most frequently detected species in breast-milk. Allergic mothers had significantly lower amounts of bifidobacteria in breast-milk compared with non-allergic mothers [median 1.3 x 10(3) bacterial cells/mL (IQR 22.4-3.0 x 10(3)) vs. 5.6 x 10(3) bacterial cells/mL (1.8 x 10(3)-1.8 x 10(4)), respectively, (P=0.004)], and their infants had concurrently lower counts of bifidobacteria in feces [3.9 x 10(8) bacterial cells/g (IQR 6.5 x 10(6)-1.5 x 10(9)) in infants of allergic mothers, vs. 2.5 x 10(9) bacterial cells/g (6.5 x 10(8)-3.2 x 10(10)) in infants of non-allergic mothers, P=0.013]. CONCLUSIONS: Breast-milk contains significant numbers of bifidobacteria and the maternal allergic status further deranges the counts of bifidobacteria in breast-milk. Maternal fecal and breast-milk bifidobacterial counts impacted on the infants' fecal Bifidobacterium levels. Breast-milk bacteria should thus be considered an important source of bacteria in the establishment of infantile intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Molecular cloning and comparative analysis of four beta-galactosidase genes from  Bifidobacterium bifidum NCIMB41171.
AB  - Bifidobacterium bifidum NCIMB41171 carries four genes encoding different beta-galactosidases. One of them, named bbgIII, consisted of an open reading frame of 1,935 amino acid (a.a.) residues encoding a protein with a multidomain structure, commonly identified on cell wall bound enzymes, having a signal peptide, a membrane anchor, FIVAR domains, immunoglobulin Ig-like and discoidin-like domains. The other three genes, termed bbgI, bbgII and bbgIV, encoded proteins of 1,291, 689 and 1,052 a.a. residues, respectively, which were most probably intracellularly located. Two cases of protein evolution between strains of the same species were identified when the a.a. sequences of the BbgI and BbgIII were compared with homologous proteins from B. bifidum DSM20215. The homologous proteins were found to be differentiated at the C-terminal a.a. part either due to a single nucleotide insertion or to a whole DNA sequence insertion, respectively. The bbgIV gene was located in a gene organisation surrounded by divergently transcribed genes putatively for sugar transport (galactoside-symporter) and gene regulation (LacI-transcriptional regulator), a structure that was found to be highly conserved in B. longum, B. adolescentis and B. infantis, suggesting optimal organisation shared amongst those species.
TI  - Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the bifidobacterial microbiota in the colonic mucosa of patients with colorectal cancer, diverticulitis and inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  - AIM: To characterize the bifidobacterial microbiota of the colonic mucosa in patients with colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease or diverticuitis. METHODS: A sample of the distal colonic mucosa was taken during surgery from a total of 34 patients, twenty-one with diagnosed colorectal cancer, nine with diverticulitis and four with inflammatory bowel disease, requiring surgery for their condition. Bacterial DNA was extracted from the resected mucosal samples and bifidobacterial mucosa-associated microbiota was qualitatively and quantitatively determined by means of qualitative and quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Bifidobacteria were found in 100% of the samples from patients with diverticulitis or IBD and a 76% of those suffering colon cancer. The species B. longum and B. bifidum were the most widely found, followed by B. animalis, B. catenulatum and B. adolescentis. B. breve, B. dentium and B. angulatum were not detected in any sample. A significantly higher occurrence of B. longum was observed in patients with diverticulitis than in those with colon cancer or IBD (100%, 62% and 75%, respectively, P < 0.05). Similar results were obtained for B. animalis (56%, 0% and 25%, P < 0.05), while B. adolescentis was only found in the mucosa from patients with colon cancer (5 out of 21, 24%). At the quantitative level, patients with colon cancer or IBD showed lower counts of total Bifidobacterium (4.94 and 5.91 vs 6.96 log cells/sample, respectively, P < 0.05) and of the species B. longum (4.05 and 4.79 vs 6.76, P < 0.05) than those with diverticulitis. CONCLUSION: Aberrancies in mucosa associated microbiota are present in different intestinal diseases. This may indicate a role of the microbiota in the pathogenesis of these diseases.
TI  - Quantitative assessment of faecal bifidobacterial populations by real-time PCR using lanthanide probes.
AB  - AIM: To develop real-time quantitative PCR methods, based on the use of probes labelled with a stable fluorescent lanthanide chelate, for the quantification of different human faecal bifidobacterial populations. METHODS AND RESULTS: The designed quantitative PCR assays were found to be specific for the corresponding Bifidobacterium species or groups (Bifidobacterium longum group, Bifidobacterium catenulatum group, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium angulatum, Bifidobacterium bifidum and Bifidobacterium dentium). The detection limits of the methodologies used ranged between 2 x 10(5) and 9 x 10(3) cells g(-1) of faeces. The applicability of the developed assays was tested by analysing 20 human faecal samples. Bif. longum group was found to be the qualitatively and quantitatively predominant bifidobacterial group. CONCLUSIONS: The real-time PCR procedures developed here are specific, accurate, rapid and easy methods for the quantification of Bifidobacterium groups or species in human faecal samples. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The developed procedures will facilitate rapid and objective counting of large numbers of samples increasing our knowledge on the role of gut bifidobacterial microbiota in health and disease. This will contribute to the efficient use of intestinal bacterial assays in research, food and pharmaceutical development as well as in the assessment of dietary management of diseases.
TI  - Establishment and follow-up of bifidobacterial species in the gut of healthy bottle-fed infants of 1-4 months age.
AB  - Twenty-one healthy bottle-fed infants were screened monthly (1-4 months) for bifidobacteria in their stools. Bifidobacteria were detected by culture and isolates specified by PCR. Alternatively, direct PCR in undiluted fecal suspensions was carried out for detection of bifidobacteria under the cultural detection level. All infants harbored cultivable bifidobacteria throughout the study period. Beerens medium was shown to permit a better recovery of bifidobacteria than MRS and horse blood Columbia agar. Direct PCR detection proved valuable in detecting species for which no cultural isolate could be recovered since the species were under the cultural detection level. B. bifidum, B. longum-infantis and B. breve were confirmed as dominant and stable species in infant stools while B. adolescentis and B. catenulatum group exhibited unstable colonization profiles. A trend towards B. breve decrease began at month 3 while carriage of the B. catenulatum group and B. adolescentis was rising. This observation warrants further analysis to assess a possible switch occurring at month 3 in bottle-fed infants, between so-called infant and adult bifidobacterial species.
TI  - Population dynamics of Bifidobacterium species in human feces during raffinose administration monitored by fluorescence in situ hybridization-flow cytometry.
AB  - The population dynamics of bifidobacteria in human feces during raffinose administration were investigated at the species level by using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) coupled with flow cytometry (FCM) analysis. Although double-staining FISH-FCM using both fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and indodicarbocyanine (Cy5) as labeling dyes for fecal samples has been reported, the analysis was interfered with by strong autofluorescence at the FITC fluorescence region because of the presence of autofluorescence particles/debris in the fecal samples. We circumvented this problem by using only Cy5 fluorescent dye in the FISH-FCM analysis. Thirteen subjects received 2 g of raffinose twice a day for 4 weeks. Fecal samples were collected, and the bifidobacterial populations were monitored using the established FISH-FCM method. The results showed an increase in bifidobacteria from about 12.5% of total bacteria in the prefeeding period to about 28.7 and 37.2% after the 2-week and 4-week feeding periods, respectively. Bifidobacterium adolescentis, the Bifidobacterium catenulatum group, and Bifidobacterium longum were the major species, in that order, at the prefeeding period, and these bacteria were found to increase nearly in parallel during the raffinose administration. During the feeding periods, indigenous bifidobacterial populations became more diverse, such that minor species in human adults, such as Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium dentium, and Bifidobacterium angulatum, proliferated. Four weeks after raffinose administration was stopped, the proportion of each major bifidobacterial species, as well as that of total bifidobacteria, returned to approximately the original values for the prefeeding period, whereas that of each minor species appeared to differ considerably from its original value. To the best of our knowledge, these results provide the first clear demonstration of the population dynamics of indigenous bifidobacteria at the species level in response to raffinose administration.
TI  - [A molecular-and-genetic analysis of species and strain diversity of bifidobacteria in early childhood].
AB  - The species and strain composition of bifidobacteria in 29 children both sexes, aged 8 to 16 months, was studied. Species-specific primers and PCR were used to determine to which species the predominant strains of bifidobacteria, isolated from feces by cultural methods, belonged. Bifidobacteria were found in 28 (96.5%) children; their number was 10.2 +/- 0.7 ECU per a gram of the material. B. longum and B. bifidum were frequent (71.4 and 53.5%, respectively). The level of quantitative detection used in the study also allowed revealing of B. catenulatum (17.9%) and B. breve (14.4%). A high titer of B. dentium was found in one case (3.6%). B. adolescentis and B. angulatum were not found in any patient. The average number of species found in one child was 1.7 +/- 0.7. RAPD-PCR and investigation of plasmid profile were used to determine possible belonging of the isolates to different strains. The average number of strains per one sample was 2.3 +/- 1.2. Nine unique plasmid bifidobacterial strains were isolated from 7 children. In 3 children the intestinal tract was found to be colonized by both plasmid and non-plasmid-carrying strains of one bifidobacterial species.
TI  - Expression and secretion of Bifidobacterium adolescentis amylase by Bifidobacterium longum.
AB  - Bifidobacterium adolescentis Int-57 (INT57), isolated from human feces, secretes  an amylase. We have shot-gun cloned, sequence analyzed and expressed the gene encoding this amylase in B. longum. The sequenced 2477 bp fragment was homologous to other extracellular amylases. The encoded protein was predicted to be composed of 595 amino acids with a molecular weight of 64 kDa, and was designated AmyB. Highly conserved amylase domains were found in AmyB. The signal sequence and cleavage site was predicted by sequence analysis. AmyB was subcloned into pBES2, a novel E. coli-Bifidobacterium shuttle vector, to construct pYBamy59. Subsequently, B. longum, with no apparent amylase activity, was transformed with pYBamy59. More than 90% of the amylase activity was detected in the culture broth. This approach may open the way for the development of more efficient expression and secretion systems for Bifidobacterium.
TI  - Determination of survival, identity and stress resistance of probiotic bifidobacteria in bio-yoghurts.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the level of bifidobacteria in bio-yoghurts in the UK, identify the species, and compare the resistance of common Bifidobacterium spp. to acidity and oxidative stress. METHODS AND RESULTS: A storage trial of bio-yoghurts was carried out to determine the level and survival of bifidobacteria. The 16S rRNA gene targeted PCR was used to identify the species. Acid tolerance was determined by introducing the organisms to pH-adjusted skimmed milk and enumerating during storage at 4 degrees C. Oxidative stress resistance was determined using the H(2)O(2) disc diffusion assay technique. Nine of 10 bio-yoghurts contained bifidobacteria at levels >10(6) CFU g(-1) at the time of purchase. The viability of the organism decreased during storage and on expiry only five products retained viability >10(6) CFU g(-1) while two others were very close to the target population. Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis showed superior survival abilities and stress tolerance compared with Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Bifidobacterium longum biotype infantis. CONCLUSIONS: Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis, the only Bifidobacterium spp. found in bio-yoghurts, had the greatest resistance to acidity and oxidative stress. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The technological properties of B. animalis ssp. lactis make it suitable for inclusion in bio-yoghurts although its putative health benefits need further investigation.
TI  - Effect of maternal consumption of lactobacillus GG on transfer and establishment  of fecal bifidobacterial microbiota in neonates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Establishment of the gut microbiota at birth provides a substantial source of microbial stimuli for the maturation of the immune system. Deviations in this process precede the development of specific diseases providing the rationale for the use of probiotics to counteract them. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to characterize both the mother-infant bifidobacteria transfer at birth and the development of bifidobacteria microbiota during the first weeks of life in infants whose mothers received Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG or placebo. METHODS: Species-specific PCR was used to assess the fecal bifidobacterial composition of mothers before and after delivery and in infants at 5 days and 3 weeks of age. RESULTS: Bifidobacterium longum was the species most commonly found in the mothers. Bifidobacterium catenulatum was the most prevalent group in infants at 5 days of age and B. longum the predominant species at 3 weeks. At 5 days of age, infants whose mothers received L. rhamnosus GG showed a significantly higher occurrence of B. breve and lower of B. adolescentis than those from the placebo group. In addition, L. rhamnosus GG consumption increased the bifidobacterial diversity in infants and reduced the Bifidobacterium microbiota similarity between mother and infant. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that specific changes in the transfer and initial establishment of bifidobacteria in neonates take place as consequence of the consumption of L. rhamnosus GG by the mothers.
TI  - Characterization of the genus Bifidobacterium by automated ribotyping and 16S rRNA gene sequences.
AB  - In order to characterize the genus Bifidobacterium, ribopatterns and approximately 500 bp (Escherichia coli positions 27 to 520) of 16S rRNA gene sequences of 28 type strains and 64 reference strains of the genus Bifidobacterium were determined. Ribopatterns obtained from Bifidobacterium strains were divided into nine clusters (clusters I-IX) with a similarity of 60%. Cluster V, containing 17 species, was further subdivided into 22 subclusters with a similarity of 90%. In the genus Bifidobacterium, four groups were shown according to Miyake et al.: (i) the Bifidobacterium longum infantis-longum-suis type group, (ii) the B. catenulatum-pseudocatenulatum group, (iii) the B. gallinarum-saeculare-pullorum group, and (iv) the B. coryneforme-indicum group, which showed higher than 97% similarity of the 16S rRNA gene sequences in each group. Using ribotyping analysis, unique ribopatterns were obtained from these species, and they could be separated by cluster analysis. Ribopatterns of six B. adolescentis strains were separated into different clusters, and also showed diversity in 16S rRNA gene sequences. B. adolescentis consisted of heterogeneous strains. The nine strains of B. pseudolongum subsp. pseudolongum were divided into five subclusters. Each type strain of B. pseudolongum subsp. pseudolongum and B. pseudolongum subsp. globosum and two intermediate groups, which were suggested by Yaeshima et al., consisted of individual clusters. B. animalis subsp. animalis and B. animalis subsp. lactis could not be separated by ribotyping using Eco RI. We conclude that ribotyping is able to provide another characteristic of Bifidobacterium strains in addition to 16S rRNA gene sequence phylogenetic analysis, and this information suggests that ribotyping analysis is a useful tool for the characterization of Bifidobacterium species in combination with other techniques for taxonomic characterization.
TI  - Characterization of human intestinal bifidobacteria using competitive PCR and PCR-TTGE.
AB  - In this study, a competitive PCR was developed to estimate the quantity of bifidobacteria in human faecal samples using two 16S rRNA gene Bifidobacterium genus-specific primers, Bif164f and Bif662r. A PCR-temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) with the same primers also allowed us to describe the Bifidobacterium species present in these faecal samples. The PCR product obtained from the competitor had 467 bp, and was 47 bp shorter than the PCR products obtained from Bifidobacterium strains. The number of bifidobacterial cells was linear from 10 to 10(8) cells per PCR assay. Taking into account the dilutions of the extracted DNA, the linear range was over 8 x 10(5) bifidobacteria g(-1) of faeces. Reproducibility was assessed from 10 independent DNA extractions from the same stool and the coefficient of variation was 0.5%. When the competitive PCR was compared with the culture method, a similar count of seven out of nine Bifidobacterium pure cultures were obtained, or had a difference inferior or equal to 1 log(10). In faecal samples, the enumeration of Bifidobacterium genus in most cases gave higher results with competitive PCR than with culture on selective Columbia-Beerens agar pH 5 (P < 0.05). In conclusion, this competitive PCR allows a rapid, highly specific and reproducible quantification of Bifidobacterium genus in faecal samples. TTGE fragments co-migrating with B. longum CIP64.63 fragment were found in 10 out of 11 faecal samples. Bifidobacterium adolescentis and B. bifidum were detected in five out of 11 subjects. Thus, cPCR and PCR-TTGE can be associated in order to characterize human faecal bifidobacteria.
TI  - [Isolation and comparative analysis of glycolipid fractions in bifidobacteria].
AB  - A comparative TLC analysis of lipid extracts from Bifidobacterium longum B 379 M, B. bifidum 791, and B. adolescentis 94 BIM has been performed. It is demonstrated that carbohydrate-containing lipid components were present in the bacteria, which differed in their chromatographic mobility (Rf) from similar compounds isolated from actinomycetes Stomatococcus mucilaginosus PCM 2415T, Nocardiopsis dassonvillei PCM 2492, Propionibacterium propionicum PCM 2431, Saccharopolyspora hirsuta PCM 2279 (= ATCC 27875T), Rhodococcus equi PCMT 559 (= ATCC 3969), and Gordonia bronchialis PCM 2167. Polar lipids of bifidobacteria exhibited the closest similarity to their counterparts from propionic acid bacteria. Preparative chromatography (silica gel column I; elution with chloroform, acetone, and methanol) of the lipid extract of B. adolescentis 94 BIM made it possible to isolate fractions containing nonpolar lipids, glycolipids, and phospholipids. Further purification of the glycolipid fraction (column II; eluant, methanol gradient in chloroform) produced preparations of glycolipids and phospholipids. The preparations were studied by two-dimensional TLC using solvent systems chloroform-methanol-H2O MiLi Q (65 : 25 : 4, v/v/v) and n-butanol-acetic acid-H2O MiLi Q (60 : 20 : 20, v/v/v) for directions I and II, respectively. Two major glycolipids were revealed (G1 and G2), in addition to compounds characteristic of the polar lipid group and minor glycolipids (g), the latter being present in considerably lesser amounts.
TI  - [Analysis of Bifidobacteria spp. composition in human gut via temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE)].
AB  - Temperature Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (TGGE) method combined with 16S rDNA clone library profiling was used to analyze Bifidobacteria spp. composition in human gut in this study. Bifidobacteria group-specific TGGE patterns of 10 healthy human individuals showed that the Bifidobacteria population in humans was host-specific. The genomic diversity and species composition of Bifidobacteria in different individual was dissimilar. Through sequencing and TGGE comigration analysis of the Bifidobacteria group-specific amplicons for one healthy boy, it was revealed that the TGGE bands of this individual represented species Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. infantis, B. longum, B. adolescentis, B. pseudocatenulatum and one potentially new species, respectively. B. pseudocatenulatum was the most common species of tested samples. While as control, only two species- B. pseudocatenulatum and B. longum were isolated using traditional culture method. Bifidobacteria group-specific PCR based TGGE method combined with 16S rDNA clone library profiling is a sensitive and effective approach to resolve the population structure of Bifidobacteria in microflora of human intestinal tract.
TI  - Conditions affecting cell surface properties of human intestinal bifidobacteria.
AB  - The cell surface properties of human intestinal bifidobacteria have been characterized for 30 strains isolated from a fecal sample. Strain identification to the species level was obtained by restriction analysis of the amplified 16S rRNA gene and confirmed by DNA/DNA reassociation experiments. The isolates were grouped in four genetically homogeneous clusters whose members belonged to Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum species. Cell surface properties of Bifidobacterium strains were evaluated by determining the level of hydrophobicity, adhesion to hydrocarbons and contact angle measurements, and their autoaggregation ability. The results showed high and homogeneous level of hydrophobicity in all tested strains when contact angle measurements values were considered. On the contrary, autoaggregation assays and bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbons detected interesting differences in cell surface properties among the tested Bifidobacterium strains. The highest levels of autoaggregation, detected in B. bifidum and B. adolescentis strains, were strictly dependent on the pH of the medium. Moreover, protease treatment experiments suggested that proteins had a key role in the autoaggregating ability of B. bifidum and B. adolescentis strains.
TI  - [Analysis of the probiotic Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus community in child intestinal flora].
AB  - To investigate the distribution of child intestinal flora and the composition of  its key probiotics community, study on intestinal flora of 21 Chinese children (age 2 - 5) was conducted, which included bacteria isolation and counting, 16S rDNA sequencing and homology analysis. For identification of the key probiotics such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in children feces at the species level, the specific primers Im26/Im3 and L159/L677 for PCR amplification of partial 16S rDNA were used. The results show that the composition of child intestinal flora is was relatively stable and almost same to the intestinal flora of the youth (age 20 - 25). Culture-based approaches show that the key probiotic community in feces at the species level was highly different in composition and numbers from individual to individual. B. longum and B. pseudocatenulatum, which are detected at levels of 10(7) CFU/g (wet) in samples and the detection rates are 90.48% and 85.71% respectively, are believed to be major bifidobacterial species in child intestinal microbiota. In addition, B. adolescentis, B. bifidum, B. infantis and B. thermacidophium have also been found. L. mucosae, L. fermentum, L. salivarius, L. ruminis, L. gasseri and L. plantarum are isolated from the stools. L. mucosae (3.68 log10 CFU/g (wet), detection rate 71.43%) and L. fermentum (3.97 log10 CFU/g (wet), detection rate 52.38%) are two dominant species of Lactobacillus. Study on Chinese child intestinal flora, especially on the compositions and numbers of key probiotics in the feces will be very helpful to the development of effective probiotics in future.
TI  - Genetic diversity of viable, injured, and dead fecal bacteria assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and 16S rRNA gene analysis.
AB  - A novel approach combining a flow cytometric in situ viability assay with 16S rRNA gene analysis was used to study the relationship between diversity and activity of the fecal microbiota. Simultaneous staining with propidium iodide (PI) and SYTO BC provided clear discrimination between intact cells (49%), injured or damaged cells (19%), and dead cells (32%). The three subpopulations were sorted and characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA gene amplicons obtained from the total and bifidobacterial communities. This analysis revealed that not only the total community but also the distinct subpopulations are characteristic for each individual. Cloning and sequencing of the dominant bands of the DGGE patterns showed that most of clones retrieved from the live, injured, and dead fractions belonged to Clostridium coccoides, Clostridium leptum, and Bacteroides. We found that some of the butyrate-producing related bacteria, such as Eubacterium rectale and Eubacterium hallii, were obviously viable at the time of sampling. However, amplicons affiliated with Bacteroides and Ruminococcus obeum- and Eubacterium biforme-like bacteria, as well as Butyrivibrio crossotus, were obtained especially from the dead population. Furthermore, some bacterial clones were recovered from all sorted fractions, and this was especially noticeable for the Clostridium leptum cluster. The bifidobacterial phylotypes identified in total samples and sorted fractions were assigned to Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, and Bifidobacterium bifidum. Phylogenetic analysis of the live, dead, and injured cells revealed a remarkable physiological heterogeneity within these bacterial populations; B. longum and B. infantis were retrieved from all sorted fractions, while B. adolescentis was recovered mostly from the sorted dead fraction.
TI  - Rapid identification of potentially probiotic Bifidobacterium species by multiplex PCR using species-specific primers based on the region extending from 16S rRNA through 23S rRNA.
AB  - This study aimed at developing a novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR)  primer set for identification of the potentially probiotic Bifidobacterium species B. adolescentis, B. animalis subsp. animalis (B. animalis), B. bifidum, B. breve, B. longum biovar infantis (B. infantis), B. animalis subsp. lactis B. lactis, B. longum biovar longum (B. longum) and B. pseudolongum. The primer set comprised specific and conserved primers and was derived from the integrated sequences of 16S and 23S rRNA genes and the rRNA intergenic spacer region (ISR) of each species. It could detect and identify type strains and isolates from pharmaceuticals or dairy products corresponding to the eight Bifidobacterium species with high specificity. It was also useful for screening of the related strains from natural sources such as the gastro-intestinal tract and feces. We suggest that the assay system from this study is an efficient tool for simple, rapid and reliable identification of Bifidobacterium species for which probiotic strains are known.
TI  - Phytase activity as a novel metabolic feature in Bifidobacterium.
AB  - Phytase activity has been detected for the first time in Bifidobacterium spp. These bacteria were able to dephosphorylate phytic acid (myo-inositol hexaphosphate, IP(6)) and generate several myo-inositol phosphate intermediates (IP(3)-IP(5)). B. globosum and B. pseudocatenulatum were optimally active at neutral-alkaline pH and B. adolescentis, B. angulatum and B. longum at acid pH. B. pseudocatenulatum showed the highest levels of phytase activity. This species produced maximum activity in the exponential phase of growth and when fructo-oligosaccharides were used as carbon source in the culture medium. The potential role of phytase activity from Bifidobacterium spp. in the reduction of the antinutritional properties of IP(6) is discussed.
TI  - Quantitative real-time PCR assays to identify and quantify fecal Bifidobacterium  species in infants receiving a prebiotic infant formula.
AB  - A healthy intestinal microbiota is considered to be important for priming of the  infants' mucosal and systemic immunity. Breast-fed infants typically have an intestinal microbiota dominated by different Bifidobacterium species. It has been described that allergic infants have different levels of specific Bifidobacterium species than healthy infants. For the accurate quantification of Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium angulatum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium catenulatum, Bifidobacterium dentium, Bifidobacterium infantis, and Bifidobacterium longum in fecal samples, duplex 5' nuclease assays were developed. The assays, targeting rRNA gene intergenic spacer regions, were validated and compared with conventional PCR and fluorescent in situ hybridization methods. The 5' nuclease assays were subsequently used to determine the relative amounts of different Bifidobacterium species in fecal samples from infants receiving a standard formula or a standard formula supplemented with galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides (OSF). A breast-fed group was studied in parallel as a reference. The results showed a significant increase in the total amount of fecal bifidobacteria (54.8% +/- 9.8% to 73.4% +/- 4.0%) in infants receiving the prebiotic formula (OSF), with a diversity of Bifidobacterium species similar to breast-fed infants. The intestinal microbiota of infants who received a standard formula seems to resemble a more adult-like distribution of bifidobacteria and contains relatively more B. catenulatum and B. adolescentis (2.71% +/- 1.92% and 8.11% +/- 4.12%, respectively, versus 0.15% +/- 0.11% and 1.38% +/- 0.98% for the OSF group). In conclusion, the specific prebiotic infant formula used induces a fecal microbiota that closely resembles the microbiota of breast-fed infants also at the level of the different Bifidobacterium species.
TI  - Variation of microbiological and biochemical parameters in the faeces of two healthy people over a 15 day period.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent years have seen increasing interest in the complex microbial ecosystem of the human gastrointestinal tract. Knowledge of its microbial colonists and their beneficial/detrimental activities is important. However, generalized assumptions about the microbial composition of the human gut should be taken with caution until more studies in different human communities have been conducted. The capacity of modulating or inhibiting harmful populations through high doses of beneficial microorganisms (probiotics) is now an attractive possibility. AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine the daily variation in the most prominent and representative of the cultivable microbial populations in the faeces of two healthy Spanish persons, with special reference to the lactic acid bacteria (lactobacilli and bifidobacteria). Faecal enzymatic activities caused or modulated by gut microorganisms were also examined. METHODS: Microbial populations were enumerated in selective and differential media. LAB species isolated from MRS agar plates were further identified by phenotypic and genetic techniques. Enzymatic activities were measured by the semi quantitative method of the API ZYM system. RESULTS: Obligate anaerobes (members of the Clostridium clusters and species of bacteroides and bifidobacteria) made up the largest bacterial populations in both individuals (ranging between 10(10)-10(11) cfu/g of faeces) and remained constant over time. Lactobacilli species were found at an intermediate level (around 10(8) cfu/g), and yeasts and moulds, staphylococci, enterococci, coliforms and Enterobacteriaceae at a lower level (between 10(3) to 10(6) cfu/g). 38 lactic acid bacteria strains identified belonged to Bifidobacterium bifidum [19], Bifidobacterium longum [7], Bifidobacterium adolescentis [7] and Lactobacillus ruminis [5] species. Enzymatic profiles and values were shown to be personal and stable, but inter-sample fluctuations were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: The dominant microbial populations in the faeces of the two persons were similar and stable during the sampling period. Large differences were found in the lactic acid bacterial composition of each individual. Biochemistry seemed to be also personal and stable over time.
TI  - Comparison of compositions and metabolic activities of fecal microbiotas in young adults and in antibiotic-treated and non-antibiotic-treated elderly subjects.
AB  - The colonic microbiota mediates many cellular and molecular events in the host that are important to health. These processes can be affected in the elderly, because in some individuals, the composition and metabolic activities of the microbiota change with age. Detailed characterizations of the major groups of fecal bacteria in healthy young adults, in healthy elderly people, and in hospitalized elderly patients receiving antibiotics were made in this study, together with measurements of their metabolic activities, by analysis of fecal organic acid and ammonia concentrations. The results showed that total anaerobe numbers remained relatively constant in old people; however, individual bacterial genera changed markedly with age. Reductions in numbers of bacteroides and bifidobacteria in both elderly groups were accompanied by reduced species diversity. Bifidobacterial populations in particular showed marked variations in the dominant species, with Bifidobacterium angulatum and Bifidobacterium adolescentis being frequently isolated from the elderly and Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium catenulatum, Bifidobacterium boum, and Bifidobacterium infantis being detected only from the healthy young volunteers. Reductions in amylolytic activities of bacterial isolates in healthy elderly subjects and reduced short-chain fatty acid concentrations supported these findings, since bifidobacteria and bacteroides are important saccharolytic groups in the colon. Conversely, higher numbers of proteolytic bacteria were observed with feces samples from the antibiotic-treated elderly group, which were also associated with increased proteolytic species diversity (fusobacteria, clostridia, and propionibacteria). Other differences in the intestinal ecosystem in elderly subjects were observed, with alterations in the dominant clostridial species in combination with greater numbers of facultative anaerobes.
TI  - Selection of acid tolerant bifidobacteria and evidence for a low-pH-inducible acid tolerance response in Bifidobacterium longum.
AB  - Acidity is an environmental condition commonly encountered by lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria in the gastrointestinal tract and fermented foods. In the present study, 22 strains of Bifidobacterium were screened for acid tolerance in artificial gastric juice (AGJ, pH 3.0) and fermented milk. AGJ tolerance was found to be strain-specific, with a pronounced variation among the strains. Several strains with a high survival rate in AGJ that belonged to Bifid. longum, Bifid. breve and Bifid. adolescentis were selected. Among them, only strain BL1 of Bifid longum was found to possess a high survival rate in fermented milk during refrigerated storage. Strain BL1 exhibited a survival rate of more than 25% in AGJ at pH 3.0 for 2 h and maintained a viable cfu level of more than 10(8) per gram of product in fermented milk (pH 4.6) under refrigerated conditions for 2 weeks. The acid tolerance of strain BL1 was found to depend on the final growth pH (<4.5). Rapid loss of acid tolerance was observed when the cells were shifted from acid to neutral conditions by addition of NaOH. Strain BL1 cells were able to maintain much higher intracellular pH under acid conditions, in comparison with those of AGJ sensitive mutant (BL1-S) or cells that lost acid tolerance following pH shifting from acid to neutral conditions. These results suggested that a cytoplasmic pH homeostasis system may function in the acid tolerance response in this strain.
TI  - Genetic heterogeneity and functional properties of intestinal bifidobacteria.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of the present study was to compare several molecular methods for the identification and genotyping of bifidobacteria, and further to investigate genetic heterogeneity and functional properties of bifidobacterial isolates from intestinal samples of Finnish adult subjects. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 153 intestinal bifidobacterial isolates were included in initial screening and 34 isolates were further characterized. Identification results obtained with PCR-ELISA and ribotyping were well in accordance with each other, while randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) gave tentative identification only to Bifidobacterium bifidum and to 65% of the B. longum isolates. The most commonly detected species were B. longum biotype longum followed by B. adolescentis and B. bifidum. In addition, B. animalis (lactis), B. angulatum and B. pseudocatenulatum were found. Ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) proved to be discriminatory methods for bifidobacteria, but also RAPD revealed intraspecies heterogeneity. Besides two B. animalis (lactis) isolates with very close similarity to a commercially available probiotic strain, none of the intestinal isolates showed optimal survival in all tolerance (acid, bile and oxygen) or growth performance tests. CONCLUSIONS: Several species/strains of bifidobacteria simultaneously colonize the gastrointestinal tract of healthy Finnish adults and intestinal Bifidobacterium isolates were genetically heterogeneous. Functional properties of bifidobacteria were strain-dependent. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Applicability of ribotyping with the automated RiboPrinter System for identification and genotyping of bifidobacteria was shown in the present study.
TI  - Development of multi-color FISH method for analysis of seven Bifidobacterium species in human feces.
AB  - We have developed a multi-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method  which detects, by a single reaction, all seven species of Bifidobacterium (B. adolescentis, B. angulatum, B. bifidum, B. breve, B. catenulatum, B. dentium, and B. longum), the dominant bacteria in human feces. First, eight new types of oligonucleotide probe were designed, complementary with the 16S rRNA sequence specific to genus Bifidobacterium and each bifidobacterial species described above. Using whole cell hybridization, the fluorescent intensity was measured against the bacterial species targeted by each probe, to show that each probe is specific to the targeted bacteria and that the relative fluorescent intensity (RFI) as an indicator of probe accessibility is high at 61-117%. Then, bacterial species-specific probes were labeled with fluorochromes (FITC, TAMRA and Cy5) in seven different ways, singly or in combination. Using these probes, seven species of Bifidobacterium were differentially stained in mixed samples of cultured bacteria and feces from adult volunteers, proving the efficacy of this technique.
TI  - Enumeration, isolation, and identification of bifidobacteria from infant feces.
AB  - Thirty-three fully breast-fed infants aged between 1 and 12 weeks were screened for bifidobacteria in feces. Bifidobacteria counts in most fecal samples determined both by TPY agar and FISH procedure ranged from 10(8) to 10(11) CFU/g. Three infants did not contain any bifidobacteria in their fecal samples. One child was delivered by caesarean section and the other two by normal vaginal delivery. All bifidobacteria-free infants possessed Gram-positive regular rods as a major group of their fecal flora. These bacteria were identified as clostridia using genus-specific FISH probe. In bifidobacteria-positive samples, B. longum (57.9% of the samples) was the most frequently found species, followed by B. adolescentis (31.6%), B. bifidum (21.0%), B. breve (10.5%), B. pseudocatenulatum (5.3%), and B. dentium (5.3%).
TI  - [Growth and morphological characteristics of industrial strains of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus cultivated in hydrolysate-milk and hydrolysate-soybean media].
AB  - Growth features of industrial strains of Bifidobacterium adolescentis MC-42, B. bifidum 1, B. longum B-379, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 8-79 and L. plantarum 8PA3 cultivated in hydrolysate-milk or hydrolysate-soybean media (HMM and HSM respectively) were analysed comparatively. The bacterial cells were investigated morphometrically with atom strength microscopy. It was shown that HSM vs HMM provided a higher growth rate of the strains (shortened growth phases and higher growth rates) that was more evident for the bifidobacteria as compared to the lactobacilli. At the same time, the morphological features of the bacterial cells slightly depended on the medium composition and were mainly defined by the genus.
TI  - In vitro digestion of sinigrin and glucotropaeolin by single strains of Bifidobacterium and identification of the digestive products.
AB  - Three strains of Bifidobacterium sp., B. pseudocatenulatum, B. adolescentis, and  B. longum were studied for their ability to digest glucosinolates, sinigrin (SNG) and glucotropaeolin (GTL), in vitro. All strains digested both glucosinolates during 24-48 h cultivation, accompanied by a decline in the medium pH from 7.1 to 5.2. The digestion of glucosinolates by a cell-free extract prepared from sonicated cells of B. adolescentis, but not cultivated broth, increased in the presence of 0.5 mM l-ascorbic acid. Also, a time-dependent formation of allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) was observed when the cell-free extract was incubated with 0.25 mM SNG for 120 min at pH 7.0. These reaction features suggest that the digestive activity may have been due to an enzyme similar to myrosinase, an enzyme of plant origin. GC-MS analysis of the Bifidobacterial cultured broth showed that the major products were 3-butenenitrile (BCN) and phenylacetonitrile (PhACN), from SNG and GTL, respectively and nitriles, probably due to a decrease in the pH of the media. AITC and benzyl isothiocyanate (BzITC) were barely detectable in the broth. It was concluded that the three species of Bifidobacteria could be involved in digestive degradation of glucosinolates in the human intestinal tract.
TI  - Quantitative PCR with 16S rRNA-gene-targeted species-specific primers for analysis of human intestinal bifidobacteria.
AB  - A highly sensitive quantitative PCR detection method has been developed and applied to the distribution analysis of human intestinal bifidobacteria by combining real-time PCR with Bifidobacterium genus- and species-specific primers. Real-time PCR detection of serially diluted DNA extracted from cultured bifidobacteria was linear for cell counts ranging from 10(6) to 10 cells per PCR assay. It was also found that the method was applicable to the detection of Bifidobacterium in feces when it was present at concentrations of >10(6) cells per g of feces. Concerning the distribution of Bifidobacterium species in intestinal flora, the Bifidobacterium adolescentis group, the Bifidobacterium catenulatum group, and Bifidobacterium longum were found to be the three predominant species by examination of DNA extracted from the feces of 46 healthy adults. We also examined changes in the population and composition of Bifidobacterium species in human intestinal flora of six healthy adults over an 8-month period. The results showed that the composition of bifidobacterial flora was basically stable throughout the test period.
TI  - Genus- and species-specific PCR primers for the detection and identification of bifidobacteria.
AB  - 16SrDNA-targeted genus- and species-specific PCR primers have been developed and  used for the identification and detection of bifidobacteria. These primers cover all of the described species that inhabit the human gut, or occur in dairy products. Identification of cultured bifidobacteria using PCR primer pairs is rapid and accurate, being based on nucleic acid sequences. Detection of bifidobacteria can be achieved using DNA extracted from human faeces as template in PCR reactions. We have found that, in adult faeces, the Bifidobacterium catenulatum group was the most commonly detected species, followed by Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, and Bifidobacterium bifidum. In breastfed infants, Bifidobacterium breve was the most frequently detected species, followed by Bifidobacterium infantis, B. longum and B. bifidum. It was notable that the B. catenulatum group was detected with the highest frequency in adults, although it has often been reported that B. adolescentis is the most common species. Real-time, quantitative PCR using primers targeting 16S rDNA shows promise in the enumeration of bifidobacteria in faecal samples. The approach to detect the target bacteria with quantitative PCR described in this review will contribute to future studies of the composition and dynamics of the intestinal microflora.
TI  - Multiplex PCR using 16S rRNA gene-targeted primers for the identification of bifidobacteria from human origin.
AB  - Three multiplex polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) targeted on Bifidobacterium and related species were designed to identify human species. The selected primers yielded amplified products of various sizes, each specific for a species. Three to four pairs were gathered in one PCR reaction and their specificity under multiplex conditions was confirmed using DNA from 26 reference strains. Using this technique on unidentified faecal strains, B. bifidum, B. longum and B. breve species were commonly recovered in infants while B. adolescentis, B. catenulatum/B. pseudocatenulatum continuum and B. longum species were predominant in adults. Thus, a single PCR can provide the assignment of a strain to one these species, reducing the number of PCR reactions and hands-on time for the identification of human isolates of bifidobacteria. Moreover, this technique is also applicable for the in situ detection of bifidobacteria in DNA extracts from human stools.
TI  - Species specific identification of nine human Bifidobacterium spp. in feces.
AB  - Based on the 16S rDNA sequences, species specific primers were designed for the rapid identification by DNA amplification of nine human Bifidobacterium spp., namely B. adolescentis, B. angulatum, B. bifidum, B. breve, B. catenulatum, B. dentium, B. infantis, B. longum, B. pseudocatenulatum. B. lactis currently included in dairy products was added to the series. The primers were designed to target different positions of the 16S rDNA, allowing the simultaneous identification of these ten species of Bifidobacterium using two mixtures of primers. The identification procedure described in this paper was validated by establishing a correlation with an AluI restriction pattern of the different full length amplified 16S rDNA. This multiple primer DNA amplification technique was applied for the identification of pure colonies of Bifidobacterium spp. or directly from total bacteria recovered from human fecal samples. The technique was shown to be useful to detect dominant species and, when primers were used in separate reactions, underrepresented species could be identified as well.
TI  - Stimulation of the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by Bifidobacterium strains.
AB  - To characterize the ability of bifidobacteria to affect the production of macrophage-derived cytokines, a murine macrophage-like cell line, J774.1, was cultured in the presence of 27 strains of heat-inactivated bifidobacteria. Bifidobacterium adolescentis and B. longum, known as adult-type bifidobacteria, induced significantly more pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, IL-12 and TNF-alpha, by J774.1 cells, than did the infant-type bifidobacteria, B. bifidum, B. breve, and B. infantis (P<0.01). In contrast, B. adolescentis did not stimulate the production of anti-inflammatory IL-10 from J774.1 cells as the other tested bacteria did. The results suggest that the adult-type bifidobacteria, especially B. adolescentis, may be more potent to amplify but less able to down-regulate the inflammatory response.
TI  - Development of a membrane-array method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  - A membrane-array method was developed for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples without using the expensive microarray-arrayer and laser-scanner. The 16S rDNA sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. Three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to nitrocellulose membranes. Digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled 16S rDNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from human fecal samples or pure cultured bacteria using two universal primers, and were hybridized to the membrane-array. Hybridization signals were read by NBT/BCIP color development. The 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus, B. fragilis, B. distasonis, Clostridium clostridiiforme, C. leptum, Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Peptostreptococcus productus, Ruminococcus obeum, R. bromii, R. callidus, R. albus, Bifidobacterium longum, B. adolescentis, B. infantis, Eubacterium biforme, E. aerofaciens, Lactobacillus acidophilus,Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecium. The two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16S rDNA from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. The hybridization results indicated that the membrane-array method is a reliable technique for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples. The result was also confirmed by using specific PCR methods for these bacteria.
TI  - PCR-ELISA II: Analysis of Bifidobacterium populations in human faecal samples from a consumption trial with Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12 and a galacto-oligosaccharide preparation.
AB  - A PCR-ELISA method was extended for detection of most common Bifidobacterium species in humans and applied to a feeding trial including administration of Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12 and galacto-oligosaccharide (GOS)-containing syrup as probiotic and prebiotic preparations, respectively. For PCR-ELISA, oligonucleotide probes based on 16S rDNA sequences were designed and tested for specificity and sensitivity with nine different bifidobacterial species followed by analysis of faecal samples. Bifidobacteria were monitored for their fluctuations during and after the feeding trial. Bifidobacterium longum was the most common species found in the faecal samples, followed by B. adolescentis and B. bifidum. During ingestion of the probiotic B. lactis Bb-12, the strain appeared in the faeces but was absent again one week after finishing of the trial. The species that were observed in the faecal samples taken prior to the feeding experiments persisted also in samples derived from the pre-feeding and feeding periods. The most consistent change observed was the decrease in the relative amount of B. longum in the test group ingesting either B. lactis Bb-12 alone or in combination with GOS-syrup. Since the amounts of B. longum increased again in the post-feeding sample with these subjects, it may suggest that to some extent B. lactis Bb-12 is able to transiently replace B. longum.
TI  - Design and evaluation of oligonucleotide-microarray method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  - An oligonucleotide-microarray method was developed for the detection of intestinal bacteria in fecal samples collected from human subjects. The 16S rDNA sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. Three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to glass slides. Cyanine5 (CY5)-labeled 16S rDNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from human fecal samples or bacterial DNA using two universal primers and were hybridized to the oligo-microarray. The 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides distasonis, Clostridium clostridiiforme, Clostridium leptum, Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Peptostreptococcus productus, Ruminococcus obeum, Ruminococcus bromii, Ruminococcus callidus, Ruminococcus albus, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium infantis, Eubacterium biforme, Eubacterium aerofaciens, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecium. The two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16S rDNA from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. The hybridization results indicated that the oligo-microarray method developed in this study is a reliable method for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples.
TI  - Identification, detection, and enumeration of human bifidobacterium species by PCR targeting the transaldolase gene.
AB  - Methods that enabled the identification, detection, and enumeration of Bifidobacterium species by PCR targeting the transaldolase gene were tested. Bifidobacterial species isolated from the feces of human adults and babies were identified by PCR amplification of a 301-bp transaldolase gene sequence and comparison of the relative migrations of the DNA fragments in denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Two subtypes of Bifidobacterium longum, five subtypes of Bifidobacterium adolescentis, and two subtypes of Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum could be differentiated using PCR-DGGE. Bifidobacterium angulatum and B. catenulatum type cultures could not be differentiated from each other. Bifidobacterial species were also detected directly in fecal samples by this combination of PCR and DGGE. The number of species detected was less than that detected by PCR using species-specific primers targeting 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA). Real-time quantitative PCR targeting a 110-bp transaldolase gene sequence was used to enumerate bifidobacteria in fecal samples. Real-time quantitative PCR measurements of bifidobacteria in fecal samples from adults correlated well with results obtained by culture when either a 16S rDNA sequence or the transaldolase gene sequence was targeted. In the case of samples from infants, 16S rDNA-targeted PCR was superior to PCR targeting the transaldolase gene for the quantification of bifidobacterial populations.
TI  - Selective responses of three Ginkgo biloba leaf-derived constituents on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The selective responses of Ginkgo biloba leaf-derived materials against six intestinal bacteria was examined using an impregnated paper disk method and compared with that of bilobalide, ginkgolides A and B, kaempferol, and quercetin. The components of G. biloba leaves were characterized as kaempferol 3-O-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside), kaempferol 3-O-(2' '-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside, and quercetin 3-O-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) by spectroscopic analysis. The growth responses varied with each bacterial strain tested. At 2 mg/disk, kaempferol 3-O-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) and quercetin 3-O-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) revealed potent inhibition against Clostridium perfringens, and kaempferol 3-O-(2' '-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside showed a clear inhibitory effect on Escherichia coli. At 0.5 mg/disk, quercetin 3-O-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) showed a strong activity against C. perfringens, but weak activity was exhibited by kaempferol 3-O-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) against C. perfringens and kaempferol 3-O-(2' '-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside against E. coli. No inhibition was observed from treatments conducted with bilobalide, ginkgolides A and B, kaempferol, or quercetin. Furthermore, these isolated compounds did not inhibit Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. longum, B. adolescentis, or Lactobacillus acidophilus.
TI  - Adhesive property of Bifidobacterium lactis LKM512 and predominant bacteria of intestinal microflora to human intestinal mucin.
AB  - The adhesive property to the intestinal mucin of Bifidobacterium lactis LKM512, B. longum, B. breve, B. bifidum, B. adolescentis, B. infantis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides distasonis, Eubacterium aerofaciens, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, and Lactobacillus acidophilus were examined. Adhesive rate of LKM512 to the mucin was significantly (p < 0.05, 0.01, or 0.001) stronger than the other strains from 2 to 100 time. Though the adhesive property of many strains was almost same to the mucin of 20-year-old and 50-year-old generations, in case of 4-month-old was different. Adhesive inhibitory effect of C. perfringens to the mucin by LKM512 was examined. Under the condition that LKM512 was 108/ml and that C. perfringens was 106/ml, adhesion of C. perfringens to the mucin was inhibited at 99.6%, when LKM512 adhered in advance. There was the strong inhibition of adhesion at 74.0%, when C. perfringens adhered to mucin in advance. Thus, LKM512 can inhibit the adhesion of harmful bacteria to the intestinal mucin, the possibility of using as a probiotic strain has to be verified.
TI  - Effect of honey on the growth of and acid production by human intestinal Bifidobacterium spp.: an in vitro comparison with commercial oligosaccharides and inulin.
AB  - Five human intestinal Bifidobacterium spp., B. longum, B. adolescentis, B. breve, B. bifidum, and B. infantis, were cultured in reinforced clostridial medium (control) and in reinforced clostridial medium supplemented with 5% (wt/vol) honey, fructooligosaccharide (FOS), galactooligosaccharide (GOS), and inulin. Inoculated samples were incubated anaerobically at 37degrees C for 48 h. Samples were collected at 12-h intervals and examined for specific growth rate. Levels of fermentation end products (lactic and acetic acids) were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Honey enhanced the growth of the five cultures much like FOS, GOS, and inulin did. Honey, FOS, GOS, and inulin were especially effective (P < 0.05) in sustaining the growth of these cultures after 24 h of incubation as compared with the control treatment. Overall, the effects of honey on lactic and acetic acid production by intestinal Bifidobacterium spp. were similar to those of FOS, GOS, and inulin.
TI  - The Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium microflora of the human intestine: composition and succession.
AB  - Lactobacillus and bifidobacterial cultures are increasingly used as probiotics in pharmaceuticals and in foods. The selection of strains is performed often for technological rather than for microecological reasons. Detailed reports about species and strains composition of these microorganisms in the intestinal microflora of man are rare. Our investigations were performed with samples originating from infants and adults, taken from faeces and from upper sections of the intestinal tract including mouth and stomach, and from caecum and colon. Post mortem cases as well as test subjects under physiological conditions were analyzed using an automatic capsule system sampling at defined times in different parts of the intestinal tract. The fate of selected strains after oral intake was studied, too. Furthermore, influences of the microflora originating from food were considered. The identification of autochthonous (indigenous) and allochthonous (transient) species could be achieved with descriptions of new species in the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. L. gasseri and L. reuteri proved to be predominant autochthonous Lactobacillus species in infants as well as in adults. Both species were occasionally present even in the stomach. This was also the case with an anaerobic lactic acid bacterium, previously named Catenabacterium catenaforme, later classified as L. ruminis, a non-motile variant of this species. The bifidobacterial microflora differed in composition between infants and adults and in different stages of the host's life. Up to 5 species or special strains of bifidobacteria could be present in different, individually fixed, combinations. Species typical for infants were B. bifidum, B. infantis, B. breve, and B. parvulorum. Typical for adults were 4 different variants of B. adolescentis. B. bifidum and B. longum could often be found in both groups, but in lower numbers. B. longum showed some oxygen tolerance whereas B. bifidum and B. adolescentis required strict anaerobic and fastidious conditions for cultivation. The autochthonous Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium microflora in man will remain stable life-long. With lactobacilli, however, some successions may be caused by transient species derived from food or from the oral cavity, thus giving the impression of an altered microflora. Nevertheless L. gasseri, L. reuteri, L. ruminis, and to some degree, L. salivarius, may be present as autochthonous species all of the time. With bifidobacteria, a decreasing tendency in counts and in multiple composition in elderly people exists. Furthermore, this microflora is also influenced by consumption habits, which are probably caused by geographical circumstances.
TI  - Differences in composition and mucosal adhesion of bifidobacteria isolated from healthy adults and healthy seniors.
AB  - Fifty-one Bifidobacterium strains were isolated from the feces of healthy adults  (30-40 years old) and seniors (older than 70 years of age). B. adolescentis, B. breve, B. infantis, and B. longum were isolated from the healthy adults and B. adolescentis and B. longum from elderly subjects. The tested bacteria bound, in vitro, to intestinal mucus in a strain dependent manner. The strains isolated from healthy adults, and especially B. adolescentis, bound better to intestinal mucus than those isolated from seniors. These results indicate that the mucosal adhesive properties of the human Bifidobacterium flora were reduced with the aging of the host. This shift to a Bifidobacterium flora with reduced adhesive abilities may explain the decrease in bifidobacteria levels in the intestinal microflora of aging people.
TI  - Selective growth inhibitor toward human intestinal bacteria derived from Pulsatilla cernua root.
AB  - Among 21 medicinal plants, the growth-inhibiting activity of Pulsatilla cernua root-derived materials toward human intestinal bacteria was examined by using an impregnated paper disk method. The biologically active components of P. cernua roots were characterized as 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid and 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid by spectroscopic analysis. The activity was compared with that of six commercially available cinnamic acid derivatives trans-cinnamaldehyde, trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxycinnamic acid, 3-methoxycinnamic acid, and 4-methoxycinnamic acid. The growth responses varied with each bacterial strain tested. Two isolated compounds revealed a potent inhibition against Clostridium perfringens, and moderate to weak activity against Escherichia coli was exhibited by 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid. Weak or no inhibitory activity was obtained against the bifidobacteria or Lactobacillus acidophilus. The inhibitory effect was much more pronounced in C. perfringens and E. coli as compared to B. adolescentis, B. bifidum, B. fragilis, B. longum, or L. acidophilus. Cinnamaldehyde exhibited a strong growth-inhibiting activity, but no inhibition was observed from treatments with trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxycinnamic acid, 3-methoxycinnamic acid, and 4-methoxycinnamic acid. These results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of P. cernua root.
TI  - Molecular microbial analysis of Bifidobacterium isolates from different environments by the species-specific amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA).
AB  - One hundred and six isolates of the genus Bifidobacterium, isolated from different environments (mainly gastrointestinal), were identified and classified taxonomically to species level by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis. Two restriction endonucleases (Sau3AI and BamHI) were chosen for aligning the 16S rRNA sequences of 16 bifidobacterial species retrieved from various databases, to obtain species-specific restriction patterns. A rapid and accurate identification scheme was obtained by comparing the resulting 16S rDNA digestion profiles of 16 Bifidobacterium type-strains and 90 strains of various origins. All of the investigated strains were previously confirmed at the species level as belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation and by polymerase chain reaction amplification with genus- and species-specific primers. The present work demonstrates that species-specific detection of Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium animalis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium catenulatum, Bifidobacterium coryneforme, Bifidobacterium cuniculi, Bifidobacterium dentium, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium lactis, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium suis, Bifidobacterium magnum, Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and Bifidobacterium pullorum present in different micro-ecological environments (e.g. gastrointestinal tract) can be accomplished in a reliable, rapid and accurate manner, circumventing the recognised deficiencies of traditional identification techniques.
TI  - Adhesion of Bifidobacterium spp. to human intestinal mucus.
AB  - Twenty-four Bifidobacterium strains were examined for their ability to bind to immobilized human and bovine intestinal mucus glycoproteins. Each of the tested bacteria exhibited its characteristic adhesion to human and bovine fecal mucus. No significant differences were found among the taxonomic species. Among the tested bacteria, B. adolescentis, B. angulatum, B. bifidum, B. breve, B. catenulatum, B. infantis, B. longum and B. pseudocatenulatum adhered to human fecal mucus better than bovine fecal mucus, while the binding of B. animalis and B. lactis was not preferential. These results suggest that the mucosal adhesive properties of bifidobacteria may be a strain dependent feature, and the mucosal binding of the human bifidobacteria may be more host specific.
TI  - Thin layer chromatographic determination of organic acids for rapid identification of bifidobacteria at genus level.
AB  - This study presents a simple and fast method for the identification of bifidobacteria using a thin layer chromatographic (TLC) analysis of the short chain fatty acids in a culture broth. When the chromatogram was sprayed with the indicator solution (methyl red-bromophenol blue in 70% ethanol), lactic acid exhibited two red spots, and acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid all produced blue spots. Succinic acid and citric acid produced yellow and dark yellow spot, respectively. In addition, these organic acids showed different R(f) values. The total time taken to analyze the organic acids in the 10 bacterial culture broths using the proposed method was approximately 50 min. The proposed TLC method was used to analyze the organic acids in culture broths of the following strains, five Bifidobacterium species. (Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve, B. infantis, B. bifidum, and B. adolescentis) and five other lactic acid bacteria strains (Lactobacillus casei, L. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and S. lactis). Both spots of lactic acid and acetic acid were detected on all the TLC plates from the five bifidobacterial culture broths. The five other lactic acid bacterial culture broths, however, only exhibited lactic acid spots. Accordingly, the proposed TLC method would appear to be a useful tool for rapid identification of Bifidobacterium spp. at the genus level.
TI  - Effect of short-chain carbohydrates on human intestinal bifidobacteria and Escherichia coli in vitro.
AB  - Plate counts and small subunit (SSU) rRNA abundance were used to study the effects of fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), fructose, or galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) on bifidobacterial populations in human faecal microbiotas. The bacteria were grown in pH-controlled anaerobic fermentation vessels. Untreated cultures and fructose-amended fermenters were used as controls. Bifidobacterium longum, B. adolescentis and B. angulatum comprised the dominant bifidobacterial populations throughout the experiment. No major differences were found in the four treatments, in terms of viable counts of the organisms or of total populations of bifidobacteria at any time point. However, large differences were observed with respect to the abundance of bifidobacterial SSU rRNA between the treatments. Greatest bifidobacterial SSU rRNA abundance was seen in FOS cultures, with the lowest in the untreated control fermentation. GOS and fructose also increased bifidobacterial SSU rRNA. Cultures supplemented with FOS and GOS were also associated with lower colony counts and SSU rRNA abundance for Escherichia coli, compared with fructose-supplemented and control fermenters. At the 24-h time point, the untreated control contained 19.8 microg of enterobacterial SSU rRNA/ml of culture fluid, compared with 11.4 microg/ml for the fructose fermentation, and 2.6 and 0.5 microg/ml for the FOS and GOS culture vessels, respectively.
TI  - Simultaneous identification of five bifidobacterium species isolated from human beings using multiple PCR primers.
AB  - On the basis of 16S rRNA sequences, 5 species-specific forward primers were designed for the identification of 5 Bifidobacterium species isolated from human intestine, namely B. bifidum, B. adolescentis, B. infantis, B. breve and B. longum. As the 5 primers targeted at different sites of 16S rDNA, by using their mixture and a genus-specific reversed primer, the 5 Bifidobacterium species can be simultaneously identified in individual or in mixed culture through PCR amplification. The specificity of the primers was confirmed by the use of genomic DNAs from type strains of all 32 Bifidobacterium species and 6 other relatives. The 5-primer mixture was also applied to the identification of Bifidobacterium strains used commercially. The results turned out to be in accordance with those from conventional identification. This multiple-primer method provides a useful tool for rapid identification of the 5 Bifidobacterium species indicated.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence, expression and transcriptional analysis of the Bifidobacterium longum MB 219 lacZ gene.
AB  - The gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of Escherichia coli from Bifidobacterium longum MB219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten Bifidobacterium strains tested of the species B. longum, B. breve, B. adolescentis, B. indicum, B. animalis and B. cuniculi. The nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to E. coli revealed the presence of a lacZ-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site. A sequence showing 72% identity with the proline tRNA of Bacillus subtilis and a gene probably encoding the DNA-3-methyladenine glycosydase I were located downstream from the lacZ gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. By primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacZ gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the -10 region of the putative promoter. The nucleotide sequence of lacZ and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes and enzymes from other microorganisms. High similarity was demonstrated between the B. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in Lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, E. coli, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Leuconostoc lactis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the LacZ family. The B. longum MB219 lacZ gene was cloned in Bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. The expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.
TI  - Cordycepin: selective growth inhibitor derived from liquid culture of Cordyceps militaris against Clostridium spp.
AB  - The growth responses of nine human intestinal bacteria to liquid culture of Cordyceps militaris Link. Pt. (Ascomycotina: Clavicipitaceae) collected from a pupa of Bombyx mori L. (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) were examined using spectrophotometric and impregnated paper disk methods and compared to those of tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as those of Coptis japonica root-derived berberine chloride. The biologically active constituent of the cultures was characterized as cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine) by spectroscopic analysis. This compound revealed potent growth-inhibiting activity toward Clostridium paraputrificum and Clostridium perfringens at 10 microgram/disk without adverse effects on the growth of Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus casei, whereas tetracycline and chloramphenicol inhibited the growth of these lactic acid-producing bacteria, clostridia and Escherichia coli. However, C. militaris-derived materials revealed no growth stimulation on the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. These results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of C. militaris. As a naturally occurring antibacterial agent, cordycepin could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by clostridia.
TI  - [The primary screening of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli strains to develop effective probiotic preparations based on them].
AB  - 10 Bifidobacterium strains and 10 Lactobacillus strains were studied for their antagonistic activity with respect to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella ozaenae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and for their sensitivity to antibiotics, widely used in clinical practice. L. acidophilus strain 5/4, L. acidophilus strain 18/4, B. adolescentis strain UX, B. longum strain 44 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity and the highest degree of antibiotic resistance. The restriction analysis of the chromosomal DNA of these strains was then made and their plasmid content was studied, making it possible to recognize these strains in future in the course of in vivo experiments.
TI  - [The vaginal Bifidobacterium flora in women of reproductive age].
AB  - The composition of vaginal bifidoflora in 56 clinically healthy women of reproductive age was studied. The study revealed that four species of bifidobacteria, viz. Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. breve, B. adolescentis 2 and B. longum, dominated in the composition of this bifidobacterial population. Nine out of 11 isolated strains were found to be capable of inhibiting indicator microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis when tested in vitro; in addition, strains B. adolescentis 2 F1, B. bifidum G1, B. breve P2 and B. longum Z4 inhibited Klebsiella ozaenae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and were also active acid producers. Three of these 4 bifidobacterial strains were capable of adhesion to vaginal epitheliocytes, while B. bifidum G1 was practically incapable of adherence to these cells, similarly to B. bifidum strain 791 of intestinal origin. In addition, the spectra of antibiotic susceptibility varied from strain to strain, but all bifidobacterial strains were susceptible to benzylpenicillin and resistant to lomefloxacin, most of them being also resistant to cyprofloxacin and gentamicin. Thus the data presented in this work are indicative of the possibility and advantages of using bifidobacterial strains belonging to this ecological niche as probiotics for the correction of the microflora of the urogenital tract in females.
TI  - [The antagonistic activity of bifidobacteria in vitro and in vivo studied by using gnotobiological technology].
AB  - The antagonistic activity of 4 strains of bifidobacteria (B. adolescentis 2 F1, B. longum Z4, B. breve R2 and B. bifidum G1), isolated from the vagina of healthy females of the reproductive age, with respect to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella ozaenae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gardnerella vaginalis were studied in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro experiments revealed that all above-mentioned bifidobacteria were capable of inhibiting the growth of all indicator bacterial strains. Still of all the bifidobacteria under study had different levels of activity. B. adolescentis strain 2 F1 exhibited the highest inhibiting activity in vitro. In contrast to in vitro experiments, in vivo experiments with B. breve R2 demonstrated its high antagonistic activity with respect to E. coli. The data thus obtained indicate that in the study of antagonistic activity the use of the in vivo model as also expedient, for it is mainly in vivo that probiotic preparations show their activity.
TI  - Basic features of the stress response in three species of bifidobacteria: B. longum, B. adolescentis, and B. breve.
AB  - The presence of the dnaK heat shock gene could be demonstrated for B. longum NCC481, B. longum NCC490, B. longum NCC585, B. adolescentis NCC251, and B. breve NCC298. Induction of dnaK on the transcriptional level was shown for NCC251 and NCC481 by increasing temperatures. NCC251 showed an additional chaperone-induction after salt or bile-salt treatment. In both strains preconditioning with bile-salts protected against otherwise lethal concentrations thereof. NCC251 when subjected to a heat stress was able to survive an otherwise lethal temperature (55 degrees C). Cross-protection was demonstrated for NCC251 since salt pretreatment resulted in increased tolerance after freeze-thawing cycles or lethal heat stress.
TI  - Metabolization of beta-(2,6)-linked fructose-oligosaccharides by different bifidobacteria.
AB  - Low-molecular-mass beta-(2,6)-linked fructose-oligosaccharides (beta-(2,6)-FOS) were examined as a new carbohydrate source for growth of bifidobacteria. beta-(2,6)-FOS were prepared from microbial high-molecular-mass levan by acid hydrolysis and refined by cation-exchange chromatography. (13)C-NMR spectroscopy confirmed the presence of predominantly beta-(2,6)-fructosyl linkages in the oligosaccharides. More than 80% beta-(2,6)-FOS was recovered after in vitro incubation with amylolytic and proteolytic enzymes, implying resistance to degradation in the upper intestinal tract. Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B. longum, B. breve, and B. pseudocatenulatum were studied in vitro for their ability to metabolize beta-(2,6)-FOS. Growth, decrease in pH, formation of short- chain fatty acids (lactate, acetate, formate) and degradation of beta-(2,6)-FOS were markedly different among species. B. adolescentis showed the best growth, produced the highest amounts of organic acids and metabolized both short- and long-chain beta-(2, 6)-FOS.
TI  - Growth-inhibiting effects of Coptis japonica root-derived isoquinoline alkaloids  on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The growth-inhibiting activity of Coptis japonica (Makino) root-derived materials toward eight human intestinal bacteria was examined using an impregnated paper disk method and compared to that of four commercially available isoquinoline alkaloids [berberine sulfate (BS), berberine iodide (BI), palmatine chloride (PC), and palmatine sulfate(PS)], as well as that of Thea sinensis leaf-derived epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). The biologically active constituents of the Coptis extract were characterized as the isoquinoline alkaloids berberine chloride (BC), palmatine iodide (PI), and coptisine chloride (CC) by spectral analysis. The growth responses varied with both chemical and bacterial strain used. In a test using 500 microg/disk, BC and PI produced a clear inhibitory effect against Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium paraputrificum, whereas weak or no inhibition was observed in Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Escherichia coli. At 1000 microg/ disk, CC revealed weak or no growth inhibition toward all test bacteria, whereas EGCG exhibited weak growth inhibition against only C. perfringens and C. paraputrificum. Among various isoquinoline alkaloids, BC exhibited more potent inhibitory activity toward C. perfringens than BI and BS, whereas the inhibitory effect was more pronounced in PI compared to PC and PS. The Coptis root-derived materials did not promote growth of B. longum and C. perfringens.
TI  - Distribution of bifidobacterial species in human intestinal microflora examined with 16S rRNA-gene-targeted species-specific primers.
AB  - In order to clarify the distribution of bifidobacterial species in the human intestinal tract, a 16S rRNA-gene-targeted species-specific PCR technique was developed and used with DNAs extracted from fecal samples obtained from 48 healthy adults and 27 breast-fed infants. To cover all of the bifidobacterial species that have been isolated from and identified in the human intestinal tract, species-specific primers for Bifidobacterium longum, B. infantis, B. dentium, and B. gallicum were developed and used with primers for B. adolescentis, B. angulatum, B. bifidum, B. breve, and the B. catenulatum group (B. catenulatum and B. pseudocatenulatum) that were developed in a previous study (T. Matsuki, K. Watanabe, R. Tanaka, and H. Oyaizu, FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 167:113-121, 1998). The specificity of the nine primers was confirmed by PCR, and the species-specific PCR method was found to be a useful means for identifying Bifidobacterium strains isolated from human feces. The results of an examination of bifidobacterial species distribution showed that the B. catenulatum group was the most commonly found taxon (detected in 44 of 48 samples [92%]), followed by B. longum and B. adolescentis, in the adult intestinal bifidobacterial flora and that B. breve, B. infantis, and B. longum were frequently found in the intestinal tracts of infants. The present study demonstrated that qualitative detection of the bifidobacterial species present in human feces can be accomplished rapidly and accurately.
TI  - Molecular monitoring of human intestinal Bifidobacterium strain diversity.
AB  - Predominant Bifidobacterium strains belonging to the intestinal flora of four human volunteers were isolated on selective medium before and after eight days of treatment with oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (Augmentin). These antimicrobial agents are known to be strongly active against the genus Bifidobacterium. A fifth volunteer did not receive the antibiotics and was considered as a control. Bifidobacteria were characterized by hybridizing a ribosomal 23S DNA probe onto their EcoRV restriction patterns, and were identified by comparing the ribosomal patterns obtained to collection strains. A total of 17 distinct ribosomal patterns and 23 distinct pattern types were revealed for the 95 isolates tested. Each type characterized was correlated with a specific ribosomal pattern associated with a specific total restriction pattern. Similar-sized molecular bands permitted isolates to be unambiguously discriminated into the species B. longum, B. bifidum, and B. adolescentis. This study enabled us to show considerable strain variability among individuals. Three months after penicillin ingestion, no significant changes were observed in Bifidobacterium flora. Each flora remained relatively stable for strain composition over time, with some slight variations also detected in our control subject.
TI  - Note: evaluation of selective media for the enumeration of Bifidobacterium sp. in milk.
AB  - Pure cultures of three species of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, Bif. adolescentis and Bif. bifidum), Lactobacillus acidophilus and a mixed culture of Lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus were each enumerated on two differential media and six selective media for the enumeration of bifidobacteria. The appearance of the colonies on the differential media was as expected but when mixed cultures were present, it proved extremely difficult to distinguish one species from another. Of the selective media, AMC, RMS, NPNL and BL-OG performed well in that they gave good recoveries of bifidobacteria and were inhibitory to the growth of Lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Strep. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lact. acidophilus. However, of these four media, AMC was most convenient as it is based on a commercially available medium, whereas the others must be made up from individual constituents. The AMC agar is thus a good choice for the routine enumeration of bifidobacteria from mixed cultures.
TI  - Rapid identification of human intestinal bifidobacteria by 16S rRNA-targeted species- and group-specific primers.
AB  - On the basis of 16S rRNA sequences, species- and group-specific primers for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B. angulatum, B. bifidum, B. breve, the B. catenulatum group (B. catenulatum and B. pseudocatenulatum), and the B. longum group (B. longum and B. infantis), which are species commonly found in human intestinal tracts, were developed. The specificity of these primers was confirmed through the use of DNA extracted from 46 strains of 31 Bifidobacterium species, as well as 14 non-bifidobacterial species that are the predominant bacteria in the human intestinal tract. The present species-specific primers were applied to the identification of 43 isolated strains, consisting of six strains of B. adolescentis, eight of the B. catenulatum group, seven of B. bifidum, nine of B. breve, and 13 of the B. longum group.
TI  - Characterization of bifidobacteria by random DNA amplification.
AB  - RAPD conditions were optimized to generate reproducible banding patterns by testing primers, thermocyclers and overall reproducibility in repeat DNA analysis and separate DNA extractions. Five primers were chosen on the basis of band intensity and distribution (between 2 and 10 bands) which clearly distinguished among strains of Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B. animalis, B. bifidum, B. breve, B. infantis and B. longum. The use of five single-primer reactions under optimized conditions improved the resolution and accuracy of the RAPD method for the characterization of dairy-related bifidobacteria. The results indicated that this method was highly reproducible in repeated analysis. Similarity between bifidobacteria strains was evaluated based on their RAPD profiles. Using a set of five primers, it was demonstrated that it may be possible to distinguish three different species of Bifidobacterium (B. breve, B. bifidum and B. adolescentis), based on similarity of the RAPD profiles to known reference strains. Furthermore, application of the RAPD technique may also be useful and faster, than traditional systematics for placement of industrial strains into specific clusters (either B. longum/infantis or B. animalis/lactis).
TI  - Growth of a human intestinal Desulfovibrio desulfuricans in continuous cultures containing defined populations of saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting bacteria.
AB  - Ecological and physiological effects of the sulphate-reducing bacterium (SRB) Desulfovibrio desulfuricans on other intestinal organisms were investigated in anaerobic chemostats (dilution rate approximately 0.2 h-1). Reproducible defined bacterial communities were used in these experiments, comprising 14 different saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting species: Bifidobacterium longum, Bif. adolescentis, Bif. pseudolongum, Bif. infantis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bact. vulgatus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Cl. butyricum, Cl. innocuum, Cl. bifermentans. Lactobacillus and Cl. bifermentans populations never rose above minimum detection limits (log10 2.0 and 4.0, respectively) under the experimental conditions employed in these studies. Inclusion of Des. desulfuricans in bacterial cultures (c. log10 8.4 viable cells ml-1) resulted in marked reductions (i.e. greater than 1 log) in planktonic cell population densities of several species, particularly Bif. longum, Cl. perfringens and Bif. pseudolongum. The two bacteroides species were unaffected by Des. desulfuricans, while numbers of Cl. butyricum increased. Extensive wall growth developed in the SRB culture, consisting mainly of Des. desulfuricans (log10 9.2 viable cells ml-1), Bact. thetaiotaomicron and Bact. vulgatus, with lesser numbers of facultative anaerobes, Cl. perfringens and Bif. longum. Wall growth was associated with a reduction in planktonic cell mass and increased acid production by the cultures. Chemotaxonomic study of chemostat microbiotas, on the basis of cellular fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analyses, showed the existence of characteristic bacteroides (C15) and bifidobacterial (C18) markers, but desulfovibrio markers (i-C15:0, C16:0, i-C17:1) could be identified. The metabolic activities of saccharolytic organisms were altered in the SRB chemostat, including synthesis of a number of hydrolytic enzymes involved in carbohydrate breakdown, such as alpha-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase, together with several mucinolytic enzymes. High concentrations of sulphide (8.2 mmol 1-1) were detected in the SRB chemostat, suggesting that this metabolite may have been inhibitory to some species. Saccharolytic organisms growing in the SRB fermenter utilized more starch, but less galactose-containing polymers, which correlated with the observed glycosidase activities. Profound differences were also recorded with respect to fermentation product formation in the chemostats, where a major switch to acetate production occurred in the SRB culture, with concomitant reductions in propionate, butyrate and lactate, which is an important electron donor for desulfovibrios.
TI  - Growth-inhibitory effects of Galla Rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The growth-inhibitory activity of Galla Rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. The biologically active components of Galla Rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (MG) and gallic acid (GA) by spectral analysis. The growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. In the test using 10 mg disc-1, MG and GA produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens, Cl. paraputrificum, Eubacterium limosum, Bacteroides fragilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards Bifidobacterium adolescentis or B. longum whereas the growth of B. bifidum, B. breve, B. infantis, B. animalis, B. thermophilum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. plantarum and Streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. However, GA did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. At 5 mg disc-1, MG significantly inhibited the growth of Cl. perfringens and Cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. At 1 mg disc-1, MG greatly inhibited the growth of Cl. perfringens alone. These results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of Galla Rhois.
TI  - Digoxigenin-labeled deoxyribonucleic acid probes for the enumeration of bifidobacteria in fecal samples.
AB  - The numbers of bifidobacteria in fecal samples were specifically determined by colony hybridization with the mixture of digoxigenin-labeled DNA probes that were prepared from whole chromosomal DNA of Bifidobacterium longum 6001 and Bifidobacterium adolescentis 6003. These DNA probes strongly hybridized with DNA of B. longum, B. adolescentis, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium suis, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium angulatum, and Bifidobacterium animalis. Detectable positive signals with DNA of Bifidobacterium pseudolongum ssp. pseudolongum, Bifidobacterium catenulatum, and Bifidobacterium thermophilum were also found after hybridization. When dot-blot hybridization was performed with whole cells of 47 reference strains containing 11 species (16 strains) of bifidobacteria, all of the bifidobacteria tested could be specifically detected by using these DNA probes; Lactobacillus fermentum JCM 1173, however, showed a slight nonspecific signal. The counts of bifidobacteria by colony hybridization in the fecal samples of four of the five subjects were the same as the counts that were obtained by the conventional method using BL agar medium. Furthermore, no significant difference existed in the number of bifidobacteria that were determined by either method.
TI  - PCR detection and quantitation of predominant anaerobic bacteria in human and animal fecal samples.
AB  - PCR procedures based on 16S rRNA gene sequences specific for 12 anaerobic bacteria that predominate in the human intestinal tract were developed and used for quantitative detection of these species in human (adult and baby) feces and animal (rat, mouse, cat, dog, monkey, and rabbit) feces. Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Peptostreptococcus productus, and Clostridium clostridiiforme had high PCR titers (the maximum dilutions for positive PCR results ranged from 10(-3) to 10(-8)) in all of the human and animal fecal samples tested. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides vulgatus, and Eubacterium limosum also showed higher PCR titers (10(-2) to 10(-6)) in adult human feces. The other bacteria tested, including Escherichia coli, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Eubacterium biforme, and Bacteroides distasonis, were either at low PCR titers (less than 10(-2)) or not detected by PCR. The reported PCR procedure including the fecal sample preparation method is simplified and rapid and eliminates the DNA isolation steps.
TI  - Influence of two infant formulas and human milk on the development of the faecal  flora in newborn infants.
AB  - The establishment of the faecal flora of 39 full-term infants fed exclusively on  breast milk (n = 20) or with two different modern adapted cow's milk formulas (n = 19) was studied during the first 3 months of life. One formula investigated was based on 100% bovine casein as the protein source whereas the other formula contained bovine milk proteins with a whey/casein ratio of 60:40. A faecal flora rich in bifidobacteria was found in all study groups; the growth of putrefactive bacteria (especially Bacteroides spp.), however, was limited. In formula-fed infants, significantly higher bacterial counts of enterococci and clostridia were detected compared to breast milk-fed infants. Similarities and differences due to the feeding regimen were particularly reflected in the pattern of the anaerobic bacterial species. Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. infantis and B. breve constituted the majority of the bifidobacterial flora independent of the type of milk feeding. Other bifidobacterial species such as B. longum, B. adolescentis, B. parabifidum and B. pseudo-catenulatum were detected in high numbers and at low frequencies in breastfed infants. The latter three were observed in infants fed the whey/casein formula as well. It seems that infants fed a casein formula develop a faecal flora more like that of breastfed infants concerning Lactobacillus spp. (especially L. fermentum and L. brevis).
TI  - Selection of species-specific DNA probes which detect strain restriction polymorphism in four Bifidobacterium species.
AB  - Randomly cloned fragments (in a size range 1 to 2.5 kb) of DNA from Bifidobacterium longum ATCC 15707, B. adolescentis CIP 64.59T, B. bifidum CIP 64.65 and B. animalis ATCC 25527 were used as hybridization probes to characterize strains of these species and distinguish them from closely related Bifidobacterium species. The fragments were screened for hybridization with native DNA from 41 different Bifidobacterium strains. For each species, a fragment hybridizing specifically with DNA from strains of the same species was isolated. Each fragment was then hybridized with restriction digests in order to study the genome polymorphism. In some of the tested B. longum strains including strain ATCC 15707, the species-specific fragment L6/45 hybridized with 2 fragments instead of one as expected. Sequence of the fragment revealed the presence of an ORF which had an amino acid sequence similar to the site-specific recombinases of lambda integrase family. Moreover, Southern analysis demonstrated that at least 3 copies of this fragment are present in the chromosome of B. longum ATCC 15707 and in some other B. longum strains. The species-specific fragment A6/17 of B. adolescentis hybridized with the same restriction fragment on the eight strains of this species tested. The B. bifidum-specific fragment hybridized with different DNA restriction fragments according to the strain. The restriction fragment an1 from B. animalis ATCC 25527 hybridized with the same restriction fragment from strain B. animalis ATCC 27536. However, these two strains could be differentiated by another restriction pattern. Thus, hybridization results highlight the genetic polymorphism which exists among Bifidobacterium strains of the same species.
TI  - Absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium.
AB  - To investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus gasseri, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium longum, Lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. The production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by HPLC analysis in growing cultures. Resting whole cells from a positive control strain, Eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of .2 mM cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at pH 7.3. However, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. In growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by E. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. None of the test strains showed production of either deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.
TI  - Biotin production by bifidobacteria.
AB  - Biotin production and the growth of the strains of Bifidobacterium adolescentis,  B. bifidum, B. breve, B. infantis, and B. longum were studied. These five strains showed heavy growth on BL medium. But when yeast extract medium (carbon source, glucose) was used, the extent of their growth was significantly decreased, one-half or less than that of the growth on BL medium. B. bifidum grew well on yeast extract medium containing oligosaccharides, such as isomaltooligosaccharide, and produced biotin extracellularly. The utilization of oligosaccharides in biotin production by these five strains was investigated.
TI  - Analysis of intestinal flora of a patient with congenital absence of the portal vein.
AB  - A 14-year-old female patient, admitted for a closer examination of liver tumour (hepatocellular adenoma), was diagnosed as having a congenital absence of the portal vein. The blood ammonia level (approximately 120 micrograms dl-1) in the superior mesenteric vein was markedly low compared to the normal value of 300-350 micrograms dl-1 in the portal vein. The decreased ammonia concentration and urease activity of the patient's faeces were demonstrated. The dominant intestinal flora in the faeces of the patient, before operation, was Bifidobacterium sp., Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium lonqum, Lactobacillus plantarum, and after the operation Bacteroides vulgatus, Veillonella parvula, Peptococcus magnus Bifidobacterium longum. In contrast, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Bacteroides ovatus and Bacteroides distasonis, B. ovatus, Bifidobacterium adolescentis were dominant flora in the faeces of two healthy volunteers, respectively. Among microorganisms isolated from the patient, Morganella morganii, Candida sp., Eubacterium aerofacience and Eubacterium rectale were strongly positive in urease activity in vitro; Streptococcus mitior, Staphylococcus intermedius, Micrococcus kristinae, Selenomonas ruminantum, Bacteroides ureolyticus and Lactobacillus casei ss. pseudoplantarum from the healthy volunteers. These results imply the homeostatic regulation system of faecal ammonia concentration by urease-producing microorganisms in the patient.
TI  - Relationship between oxygen sensitivity and oxygen metabolism of Bifidobacterium  species.
AB  - Bifidobacteria, which are obligate anaerobes, were studied to determine the relationship between their sensitivity to oxygen and oxygen metabolism. Among the four species tested, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium breve, and Bifidobacterium longum differed from Bifidobacterium adolescentis in sensitivity to oxygen. The former three species showed marked growth under conditions of partial aeration, whereas the growth of B. adolescentis was suppressed by low concentrations of oxygen. Bifidobacteria express reduced NAD-oxidase and -peroxidase activities, which function in a pathway for two-electron reduction of molecular oxygen, producing hydrogen peroxide and, subsequently, water. Activities of reduced NAD-oxidase and -peroxidase were inversely correlated with their sensitivities to oxygen. Bifidobacterium adolescentis exhibited lowered activities of these two enzymes; the activities were 10 to 20% of those observed with B. infantis, B. breve, and B. longum. These observations are compatible with the hypothesis that reduced NAD-oxidase and reduced NAD-peroxidase in Bifidobacterium species play a role in prevention of oxygen toxicity. Superoxide dismutase activity was also detected in Bifidobacterium species. Superoxide dismutase is probably not involved in detoxification of oxygen, because the activity of this enzyme was extremely low, and the sensitivity to oxygen varied independently of superoxide dismutase activity.
TI  - Species-specific oligonucleotide probes for five Bifidobacterium species detected in human intestinal microflora.
AB  - Portions of the 16S rRNA from closely related species of the genus Bifidobacterium that are found in the human intestinal microflora were sequenced in order to design species-specific oligonucleotide probes. Five oligonucleotide probes ranging from 16 to 19 bases in length and complementary to 16S rRNA sequences from Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B. bifidum, B. breve, B. infantis, and B. longum were synthesized. With crude high-molecular-weight RNA preparations as targets, these probes showed the desired species specificity, even down to a 1-nucleotide difference. For the practical evaluation of these probes, their specificity and sensitivity were tested against seven strains of the same species and 54 strains of heterologous bacteria with fixed whole cells as targets. The probes for B. adolescentis, B. breve, and B. longum showed efficient and specific hybridization. Although the probes for B. bifidum and B. infantis cross-reacted with a few bacterial strains not isolated from humans, these probes showed species specificity for human intestinal bacteria. These 16S rRNA probes should prove valuable for the identification and detection of human intestinal Bifidobacterium species.
TI  - [The biological properties of Bifidobacterium].
AB  - The possibility of the formation of exoenzymes, such as DNAase, RNAase and hemolysin, by bifidobacteria was studied in comparison with their acid-forming and adhesive activity. Bifidobacterium reference strains, originally isolated from healthy adults and children, were studied. The study involved altogether 73 strains of bifidobacteria, including 24 B. bifidum strains, 13 B. adolescentis strains, 7 B. infantis strains, 10 B. breve strains and 19 B. longum strains. The bifidobacteria under study were shown to differ not only in the presence and activity of properties useful for macroorganisms, but also in the presence of enzymes having depolymerizing activity (DNAase, hemolysin). Thus, out of 73 strains under study 9 proved to be DNAase-positive and 6, hemolysin positive. At the same time a specific feature of bifidobacteria was their high acid-forming activity with the complete absence of RNAase activity and insignificant DNAase- and hemolysin-forming activity.
TI  - [The effect of phospholipids on the adhesive properties of bacteria].
AB  - The present work shows that choline-containing phospholipids (lysophosphatidylcholine and lyso-1-alkyl-sn-glycerophosphocholine) inhibit the adhesion of some strains: Bacterium bifidum 1, B. adolescentis MC-42, B. longum B. 379M, Staphylococcus aureus P 209 and Klebsiella pneumoniae 52. Phosphatidylcholine produces no effect on the adhesiveness of these strains, while platelet activation factor stimulates adhesiveness only in strain S. aureus 209. The stimulating or inhibiting action of phospholipids on the adhesive process of microorganisms depends on the species of bacteria and on the concentration of reagents.
TI  - Occurrence of bifidobacteria in the stool of multiple sclerosis patients.
AB  - Stool specimens from 17 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients were examined for bifidobacteria. The count of colony forming units (CFU)/g faeces and the differentiation and typing of species, especially of Bifidobacterium adolescentis biotypes were performed. The pH of the samples was also measured. Stool specimens from 17 healthy volunteers were examined as a control by the same methods (a modified medium, suitable for the detection and recognition of bifidobacteria in adults is given). The results demonstrate a significant deficiency in bifidobacteria of the adolescentis group in MS patients. In 3 patients, no bifidobacteria could be detected (less than 10(7]. In comparison with the samples from healthy donors, B. adolescentis "c" was reduced and B. adolescentis "a" could not be detected at all in MS patients' stool specimens. The occurrence of B. adolescentis "b" and B. adolescentis "d" as well as the species B. bifidum and B. longum did not significantly differ within both groups. The pH was only slightly increased in the MS group.
TI  - Phenotypic differentiation of bifidobacteria of human and animal origins.
AB  - The phenotypes of 153 strains belonging or related to the genus Bifidobacterium were studied. These organisms included 38 collection strains and 115 wild strains (41 strains of human origin, 56 strains of animal origin, and 18 strains obtained from rivers or sewage). Our phenotypic analysis revealed seven main groups that were subdivided into 20 subgroups. Seven subgroups contained no type or collection strain. Among the human strains, the type strains of Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and B. catenulatum fell into group I, which contained the type strains of B. adolescentis (subgroup Ib), B. dentium (subgroup Ic), and B. angulatum (ungrouped). The type strain of B. breve belonged to subgroup IIIa1, and the type strains of B. infantis and B. longum fell into subgroup IIIb1. Group VII comprised only wild strains that were isolated from human infant feces. Among the animal strains, group II consisted mainly of bifidobacteria that were isolated from pig feces and contained the type strains of B. suis (subgroup IIb), B. thermophilum (subgroup IIf), B. choerinum, and B. boum (ungrouped). Wild strains belonging to group V were isolated from pig, calf, cow, and chicken feces; this included the type strains of B. animalis (subgroup Va), B. magnum (subgroup Vb), B. pseudolongum, and B. globosum (subgroup Vc). The strains of human origin (groups I, III, and VII) were well separated from the animal strains (groups II, IV, and V). It was not surprising that the wild strains isolated from surface water or sewage were distributed in the animal groups as well as the human groups. Thus, bifidobacteria can be considered to be successful indicators of human or animal fecal pollution when they are correctly classified. The acidification patterns were not adequate to differentiate Bifidobacterium species, as determined previously by Mitsuoka (Bifidobacteria Microflora 3:11-28, 1984) and Scardovi (p. 1418-1434, in P. H. A. Sneath, N. S. Mair, M. E. Sharpe, and J. G. Holt, ed., Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology, vol. 2, 1986). However, enzymatic tests furnished new taxonomic criteria for the genus.
TI  - [The range of antigenic specificity of Bifidobacterium peptidoglycan].
AB  - The antigenic relationships of Bifidobacterium bifidum 1 peptidoglycans with different strains of this species (LVA-3, 791, GO-4), bifidobacteria of other species (B. adolescentis GO-13, B. breve 79-38, B. lactentis 79-41, B. longum GO-3) and bacteria of remote taxonomic groups (Streptococcus faecalis 6-3. Staphylococcus aureus COM 885, S. epidermidis COM 2124. Lactobacillus plantarum 1, Escherichia coli M-17) were studied on the basis of a highly sensitive test system permitting the registration of normal human antibodies to peptidoglycans. The level of cross reactions with staphylococci and streptococci correspond to intraspecific and antigenic affinity to L. plantarum and E. coli was considerably less pronounced. Copying a number of epitopes of bifidobacteria, S. aureus peptidoglycan seems to possess additional antigenic determinants which participate in the formation of immunological responsiveness in man.
TI  - Growth-enhancing supplements for various species of the genus Bifidobacterium.
AB  - Various biological materials were tested for their growth-promoting activity of several bifidobacterial species in a synthetic medium containing ample sources of inorganic salts, vitamins, nitrogen, and carbon. It was found that only Bifidobacterium adolescentis and B. longum (ATCC 15708) grew optimally or near optimally in the synthetic medium. All the other bifidobacteria tested grew optimally only in the synthetic medium supplemented with a growth promoter. The best growth promoters for all bacteria were bovine casein digest and yeast extract rather than human milk whey. Other growth promoters, including human and bovine milk wheys, hog gastric mucin, and bovine serum albumin digest were effective with some bacterial species but not with others. Bifidobacteria also grew well when the bovine casein digest (20 mg/ml) was used as the nitrogen source. Only the yeast extract was able to improve growth under these circumstances. The nature of these growth factors has not yet been determined.
TI  - Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Clostridium spp. in fecal samples from breast-fed and bottle-fed infants with and without iron supplement.
AB  - Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Clostridium spp. isolated from the feces of 23  neonates during the first 3 months of life were identified. Of the 23 neonates, 10 were breast fed, 6 received an infant formula with iron supplement (5 mg/liter), and 7 received the formula without iron supplement (iron concentration, less than 0.5 mg/liter). The Bifidobacterium spp. most frequently isolated from the three groups of infants were B. longum, B. breve, B. adolescentis, and B. bifidum. The bacteroides spp. most frequently isolated were B. fragilis and B. vulgatus. The most common Clostridium sp. in the three groups of infants was C. perfringens. The type of milk did not select for species of Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, or Clostridium, except for Clostridium butyricum, which was isolated significantly more often from bottle-fed infants with iron supplement than from the other groups, and Clostridium tertium, which was more often isolated from breast-fed infants. The species of the three anaerobic genera did not persist for a long period of time in the three groups of infants.
TI  - Species of the genus Bifidobacterium in the feces of human adults.
AB  - In order to obtain information about the intestinal bifid microflora of human adults, a total of 288 strains of bifidobacteria isolated from 29 out of 36 fecal specimens were studied. Their assignment to known species of the genus Bifidobacterium was based on polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analyses of soluble cellular proteins. The strains were classified as B. adolescentis, B. bifidum, B. catenulatum, B. longum, B. pseudocatenulatum. The distribution of these species is reported.
TI  - Assessment of bifidobacteria as indicators of human fecal pollution.
AB  - The distribution of bifidobacteria in the environment has been examined by using  YN-6 medium. Although feces of humans, chickens, cows, dogs, pigs, horses, cats, sheep, beavers, goats, and turkeys were examined, bifidobacteria were isolated only from the feces of humans and swine. The frequency and distribution of component species of human fecal isolates were as in isolates from raw sewage. Bifidobacterium longum and B. adolescentis were most often isolated and in the highest densities. The levels of bifidobacteria in raw sewage were in the range of 10(6) organisms/100 ml, and the effect of primary and secondary sewage treatment on the number of viable organisms present was not significant. High densities of bifidobacteria were found in all samples from septic tanks. It was found that bifidobacteria did not survive as well as Escherichia coli in either fresh or marine waters. The ratio of bifidobacteria to E. coli is an indication of the age and of the effectiveness of treatment of sewage effluent.
TI  - [Bifidobacterium flora status of cosmonauts before and after completing space flights].
AB  - The state of bifidoflora was examined in eight cosmonauts before and after space  flights of varying duration. Prelaunch quantity of bifidobacteria decreased drastically. In space flights of 30 days and longer the level of acid formation by bifidobacteria was reduced. The species composition of bifidoflora remained stable. The most typical intestinal species of bifidobacteria were B. Longum and B. adolescentis.
TI  - Antibacterial sensitivity of Bifidobacterium (Lactobacillus bifidus).
AB  - The antibacterial sensitivity patterns of gram-positive, nonsporeforming, anaerobic bacilli variously classed as Lactobacillus bifidus, Actinomyces bifidus, or Bifidobacterium were studied by the plate dilution method. A total of 34 strains, mostly from human feces, was studied. Three species, B. longum, B. adolescentis, and B. bifidum, were represented with 11, 11, and 6 strains, respectively. The other six strains fell into four other species. Most strains of all types resisted 100 mug/ml or more of neomycin, polymyxin B, and nalidixic acid. They were somewhat less resistant to kanamycin and still less so to streptomycin. All strains were inhibited by less than 1 mug/ml of penicillin G and erythromycin, by 3.1 units or less per ml of bacitracin, by 3.1 mug/ml or less of chloramphenicol, and by 6.2 mug/ml or less of tetracycline and lincomycin. Most strains were inhibited by 3.1 mug/ml of vancomycin. Results were very variable with cephalothin and nitrofurantoin, with some strains quite resistant. With half of the drugs tested, there were moderate differences in sensitivity between different species. These data are discussed in relation to the effect of antimicrobial agents on bifid bacilli in the normal human fecal flora, in relation to the implications thereof, and in relation to the usefulness of several agents (particularly neomycin, nalidixic acid, and polymyxin B) in selective media for Bifidobacterium.
