TI  == design and construction of a single tube, quantitative endpoint, late-pcr multiplex assay for ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  == aims: the goal of this study was to develop a molecular diagnostic multiplex assay for the quantitative detection of microbial pathogens commonly responsible  for ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) and their antibiotic resistance using linear-after-the-exponential polymerase chain reaction (late-pcr). method and results: this multiplex assay was designed for the quantitative detection and identification of pathogen genomic dna of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, plus a control target from lactococcus lactis. after amplification, the single-stranded amplicons were detected simultaneously in the same closed tube by hybridization to low-temperature molecular beacon probes labelled with four differently coloured fluorophores. the resulting hybrids were then analysed by determining the fluorescence intensity of each of the four fluorophores as a function of temperature. conclusions: this late-pcr single tube multiplex assay generated endpoint fluorescent contours that allowed identification of all microbial pathogens commonly responsible for vap, including mrsa. the assay was quantitative, identifying the pathogens present in the sample, no matter whether  there were as few as 10 or as many 100 000 target genomes. significance and impact of the study: this assay is rapid, reliable and sensitive and is ready for preclinical testing using samples recovered from patients suffering from ventilator-associated pneumonia.

TI  == design of a single-tube, endpoint, linear-after-the-exponential-pcr assay for 17  pathogens associated with sepsis.
AB  == aims: the goal of this study was to construct a single-tube multiplex molecular diagnostic assay using linear-after-the-exponential (late)-pcr for the detection  of 17 microbial pathogens commonly associated with septicaemia. methods and results: the assay described here detects 17 pathogens associated with sepsis via amplification and analysis of gene-specific sequences. the pathogens and their targeted genes were: klebsiella spp. (phoe); acinetobacter baumannii (gyrb); staphylococcus aureus (spa); enterobacter spp. (thdf); pseudomonas aeruginosa (toxa); coagulase-negative staphylococci (tuf), enterococcus spp. (tuf); candida  spp. (p450). a sequence from an unidentified gene in lactococcus lactis, served as a positive control for assay function. late-pcr was used to generate single-stranded amplicons that were analysed at endpoint over a wide range of temperatures in four fluorescent colours. each target was detected by its pattern of hybridization to a sequence-specific low-temperature fluorescent probe derived from molecular beacons. conclusions: all 17 microbial targets were detected in samples containing low numbers of pathogen genomes in the presence of high levels of human genomic dna. significance and impact of the study: this assay used new technology to achieve an advance in the field of molecular diagnostics: a single-tube assay for detection of pathogens commonly responsible for septicaemia.

TI  == comparative genomics and functional analysis of the niap family uncover nicotinate transporters from bacteria, plants, and mammals.
AB  == the transporter(s) that mediate uptake of nicotinate and its n-methyl derivative  trigonelline are not known in plants, and certain mammalian nicotinate transporters also remain unidentified. potential candidates for these missing transporters include proteins from the ubiquitous niap family. in bacteria, niap  genes often belong to nad-related regulons, and genetic evidence supports a role  for bacillus subtilis and acinetobacter baumannii niap proteins in uptake of nicotinate or nicotinamide. other bacterial niap genes are, however, not in nad-related regulons but cluster on the chromosome with choline-related (e.g., ralstonia solanacearum and burkholderia xenovorans) or thiamin-related (e.g., thermus thermophilus) genes, implying that they might encode transporters for these compounds. radiometric uptake assays using lactococcus lactis cells expressing niap proteins showed that b. subtilis, r. solanacearum, and b. xenovorans niap transport nicotinate via an energy-dependent mechanism. likewise, niap proteins from maize (grmzm2g381453, grmzm2g066801, and grmzm2g081774), arabidopsis (at3g13050), and mouse (svop) transported nicotinate; the arabidopsis protein also transported trigonelline. in contrast, t. thermophilus niap transported only thiamin. none of the proteins tested transported choline or the  thiazole and pyrimidine products of thiamin breakdown. the maize and arabidopsis  niap proteins are the first nicotinate transporters reported in plants, the arabidopsis protein is the first trigonelline transporter, and mouse svop appears to represent a novel type of mammalian nicotinate transporter. more generally, these results indicate that specificity for nicotinate is conserved widely, but not absolutely, among pro- and eukaryotic niap family proteins.

TI  == inhibitory effect of gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms against helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  == objectives: to determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several gram-negative  and gram-positive microorganisms against helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. methods: the in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against h. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. time-kill assay was performed with two staphylococcus spp. strains. results: anti-h. pylori activity was detected with saccharomyces cerevisiae, bacillus spp., 1 enterococcus faecium and 2 lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 h. pylori strains tested. all staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-h. pylori effect: one staphylococcus auricularis and two staphylococcus epidermidis against all h. pylori tested; staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hominis and s. auricularis against six, five and seven h. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative staphylococcus against one h. pylori strain. an inhibitory effect was detected with one escherichia coli against one h. pylori. klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella spp. and acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four h. pylori strains, and enterobacter cloacae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14  h. pylori isolates. no anti-h. pylori activity was detected with one lactobacillus spp., two lactococcus lactis, four streptococcus spp., one bacillus cereus, one e. faecium, one enterococcus faecalis, one e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella oxytoca. time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two staphylococcus spp. strains tested. conclusions: several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit h. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
