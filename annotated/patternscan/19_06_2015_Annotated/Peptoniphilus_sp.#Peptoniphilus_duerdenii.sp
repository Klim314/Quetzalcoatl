TI  == bloodstream infections due to peptoniphilus spp.: report of 15 cases.
AB  == peptoniphilus spp. are gram-positive anaerobic cocci (gpac) that were formerly classified in the genus peptostreptococcus. this study describes 15 cases of peptoniphilus spp. bloodstream infection (bsi) diagnosed from 2007 to 2011 using  16s rdna sequencing in patients with pneumonia, pre-term delivery, soft tissue infection or colon or bladder disease. seven out of 15 (47%) of these cases had polymicrobial bsis. one of the isolates was closely related to p. duerdenii (eu526290), while the other 14 isolates were most closely related to a peptoniphilus sp. reference strain (atcc 29743) and p. hareii (y07839). peptoniphilus is a rare but important cause of bsi.

TI  == peptoniphilus duerdenii sp. nov. and peptoniphilus koenoeneniae sp. nov., isolated from human clinical specimens.
AB  == two previously uncharacterized strains of gram-reaction-positive, anaerobic, coccus-shaped bacteria, designated strains wal 18896(t) and wal 18898(t), were recovered from human wound specimens and characterized using phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and molecular taxonomic methods. comparative 16s rrna gene sequence analysis and chemotaxonomic and biochemical characteristics demonstrated that these organisms are genotypically and phenotypically distinct and represent  previously unidentified sublines within the order clostridiales in the phylum firmicutes. pairwise sequence analysis demonstrated that the novel organisms had  91.9% sequence similarity to each other and were most closely related to members  of the genus peptoniphilus. the major long-chain fatty acids of both strains were c(16:0,) c(18:0), c(18:1)omega9c and c(18:2)omega6,9c. based on the phenotypic and phylogenetic findings, strains wal 18896(t) ( = ccug 56065(t) = atcc baa-1640(t)) and wal 18898(t) ( = ccug 56067(t) = atcc baa-1638(t) = dsm 22616(t)) represent two novel species, for which the names peptoniphilus duerdenii sp. nov. and peptoniphilus koenoeneniae sp. nov. are proposed, respectively.
