TI  == development of in vitro denture biofilm models for halitosis related bacteria and their application in testing the efficacy of antimicrobial agents.
AB  == objective: since dentures can serve as a reservoir for halitosis-causing oral bacteria, halitosis development is a concern for denture wearers. in this study,  we surveyed the prevalence of four selected halitosis-related species (fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, veillonella atypica and klebsiella pneumoniae) in clinical denture plaque samples, and developed denture  biofilm models for these species in vitro to facilitate assessment of antimicrobial treatment efficacy. design : denture plaque from ten healthy and ten denture stomatitis patients was screened for the presence of aforementioned four species by pcr. biofilm formation by these halitosis-associated species on the surfaces of denture base resin (dbr) discs was evaluated by crystal violet staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy. the efficacy of denture cleanser treatment on these mono-species biofilms was evaluated by colony counting. results : 80% of the subjects in the denture stomatitis group and 60% in the healthy group contained at least one of the targeted halitosis-related species in their denture plaque. all halitosis species tested were able to form biofilms on  dbr disc surfaces to varying degrees. these in vitro mono-species resin biofilm models were used to evaluate the efficacy of denture cleansers, which exhibited differential efficacies. when forming biofilms on resin surfaces, the halitosis-related species displayed enhanced resistance to denture cleansers compared with their planktonic counterparts. conclusion : the four selected halitosis-related bacterial species examined in this study are present on the majority of dentures. the mono-species biofilm models established on dbr discs for these species are an efficient screening tool for dental product evaluation.

TI  == effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic species--an in vitro study.
AB  == the in vitro study was aimed to determine the effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic microorganisms. ozone was generated for 6 s-2 x 24 s (corresponding to 0.56 mg-2 x 2.24 mg of ozone) against 23 mainly anaerobic periodontopathogenic species. agar diffusion test was used as a screening method. then, the killing activity was tested in a serum-free environment and with 25% v/v inactivated serum. further, the effect of ozone on bactericidal activity of native serum was analyzed against fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. agar diffusion test showed a high efficacy of ozone against microorganisms, especially against porphyromonas gingivalis. this result was confirmed by the killing tests; most of the strains in a concentration of 10(5) were completely eliminated after twofold 18-s application of ozone. only four of the six potentially "superinfecting" species (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, candida albicans) survived in part. addition of heat-inactivated serum reduced the killing rate of ozone by 78% after 6-s and by 47% after twofold 18-s exposures; no strain was completely eradicated after any application of ozone. the bactericidal effect of native serum was enhanced after application of ozone; no effect was visible on the included a. actinomycetemcomitans strain which was found to be completely resistant to the bactericidal action of serum. in conclusion, (a) ozone has a strong antibacterial activity against putative periodontopathogenic microorganisms, and (b) the bactericidal effect is reduced in the presence of serum. ozone may have potential as an adjunctive application to mechanical treatment in periodontitis patients.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of sodium citrate against streptococcus pneumoniae and several oral bacteria.
AB  == aims: the aim of this study is to assess the antibacterial activity of sodium citrate against streptococcus pneumoniae and several oral bacteria. methods and results: the antibacterial activity was determined by broth microdilution method. the results showed that although enterocuccus faecium ob7084 and klebsiella pneumoniae ob7088 had high tolerance to sodium citrate, several oral bacteria including fusobacterium nucleatum jcm8532(t) , streptococcus mutans jcm5705(t) and strep. pneumoniae nbrc102642(t) were susceptible. furthermore, the bactericidal activity of sodium citrate against strep. pneumoniae nbrc102642(t) was not influenced by ph in the range of 5.0-8.0, whereas that of sodium lactate  was weakened at neutral or weak alkaline ph. when strep. pneumoniae nbrc102642(t) was treated with sodium citrate for 2 h, many burst cells were observed. however, addition of mgcl(2) or cacl(2) to an assay medium weakened the antimicrobial activity although zncl(2) or mncl(2) did not influence. conclusions: independent  of ph, sodium citrate inhibited the growth of oral bacteria, which suggests that  the mechanism is different from that of sodium lactate. significance and impact of the study: the results presented in this study would be available for understanding the antimicrobial property of sodium citrate.

TI  == role of anaerobes in acute pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  == pouch of douglas aspirates were collected from 50 women with history and examination suggestive of acute pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) and 20 healthy  women admitted for tubal ligation served as control. a total of 57 microorganisms were isolated from 37 patients out of 50 in study group. of 37 positive cultures  21(56.7%) were monomicrobial and 16(43.2%) were polymicrobial. most common symptom in study group was lower abdominal pain (90%), vaginal discharge (70%) and irregular bleeding (40%) and 30% patients had history of intrauterine contraceptive device (iucd) implantation. the predominant aerobic isolates were escherichia coli, coagulase negative staphylococcus (cons), staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae while common anaerobes were bacteroides fragilis, prevotella melaninogenica, fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus spp. our study shows that cefotaxime, cefuroxime and gentamicin may be used for gram negative aerobic bacilli; cloxacillin, cephaloridine and erythromycin for aerobic gram positive cocci and amikacin and ceftazidime for pseudomonas aeruginosa. thus for optimum therapy of acute pid it is beneficial to keep in mind major conceptual changes and therapeutic realities that have influenced current understanding of acute pid and have affected the choice of therapy.

TI  == sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

TI  == periodontal microflora of hiv infected patients with periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the microbial profile of periodontal lesions in hiv seropositive patients and to compare it with rapidly progressing periodontal lesions in systemically healthy patients. the subgingival microflora  of 20 cdc ii, 20 cdc iii, 20 cdc iv/v and 20 systemically healthy patients with rapidly progressing periodontitis was examined. four sites with greatest probing  depth in each patient were selected for microbiological sampling. the samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. the microflora of periodontitis lesions within the three stages of the hiv infection was similar to that of progressing periodontitis in systemically healthy adults including campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, selenomonas spp. and peptostreptococcus micros. however, hiv seropositive periodontitis lesions harboured a range of exogenous pathogens rarely associated with common types of periodontitis including staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloaca, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus avium, clostridium difficile, aspergillus fumigatus, klebsiella pneumoniae and mycoplasma incognitum. the lack of immune effector and regulatory cells in hiv infected patients could in fact explain the increase of some opportunistic pathogens and the characteristic and rapidly progressing nature of the periodontal disease in these patients.

TI  == formation of nitrogen-containing metabolites from geniposide and gardenoside by human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == during the course of our studies on the metabolism of iridoid glycosides by human intestinal bacteria, we found that geniposide (1) and gardenoside (4) were transformed to new nitrogen-containing compounds, genipinine (3) and gardenine (6), respectively, along with the known aglycones. although the amounts of new metabolites were somewhat lower than those of the aglycones, they were quantitatively analyzed by means of liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (lc/ms). of 25 strains of human intestinal bacteria, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, klebsiella pneumoniae, fusobacterium nucleatum, and bacteroides fragilis ssp. thetaotus produced appreciable amounts of 3, while a bacterial mixture of human feces produced 10 times or more higher amounts of 3, as compared to the individual strains.

TI  == studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  == two unique forms of periodontal disease, hiv-gingivitis and hiv-periodontitis, have been described in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). in order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in aids patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 aids patients with periodontitis. the presence of putative periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly b. gingivalis), and wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 aids patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. of 666 bacterial  strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, streptococcus sanguis ii was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), porphyromonas gingivalis  (12%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. enteric species including enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis, clostridium clostridiiforme and clostridium difficle as well as klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. intermedius, and  p. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four  times more periodontitis patients demonstrated w. recta. subgingival yeast was a  frequent finding in these aids patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. this study indicates that subgingival plaque in aids patients with  periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-hiv infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.

TI  == the relationship between fusobacterium species and other flora in mixed infection.
AB  == mixed infections with three fusobacterium species and seven other bacterial species were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. fifteen fusobacterium isolates (eight f. nucleatum, four f. necrophorum, and three f. varium) and one isolate each of bacteroides fragilis, b. asaccharolyticus, staphylococcus aureus, group a beta-haemolytic streptococcus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied. electronmicrographs showed the presence of a thin mucopolysaccharide wall before  and after inoculation into mice in 12 isolates which included all of 11 fusobacterium isolates that induced subcutaneous abscesses. after co-inoculation  of fusobacterium isolates with other species and selective therapy with antimicrobial agents, s. aureus and k. pneumoniae were found to be of equal or greater importance in abscess induction than were fusobacterium isolates, while fusobacterium isolates were found to be more important than group a streptococci  and e. coli. mutual enhancement of the numbers of organisms in mixed infections was observed with fusobacterium spp. and k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa or bacteroides spp. suppression of fusobacterium spp. was noticed only when they were co-inoculated with group a streptococci. the additive or synergistic capabilities of fusobacterium species highlighted their potential pathogenicity in infection.

TI  == head-space gas-liquid chromatographic analysis for presumptive identification of  bacteria in blood cultures.
AB  == a total of 445 strains of common aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were analyzed for their volatile microbial metabolites by head-space gas-liquid chromatography. the bacteria were incubated for 24 or 48 h in blood-containing trypticase soy or lombard-dowell glucose broth before being analyzed by automatic head-space injection. from the chromatographic pattern obtained, the majority of klebsiella  pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, enterococci,  bacteroides fragilis, fusobacterium nucleatum and propionibacterium acnes could be characterized. the head-space technique developed provides a rapid, direct and easily-performed means for presumptive identification of bacteria found in blood  culture.

TI  == clindamycin in treatment of aspiration pneumonia in children.
AB  == twenty-eight patients with anaerobic pleuropulmonary infections were treated with clindamycin alone or clindamycin with gentamicin. sixteen of the patients presented with pneumonitis, nine with necrotizing pneumonia, and three with lung  abscesses. the average length of treatment was 13.8 days, and the duration of temperature after initiation of therapy was 3.1 days. the predominant isolates were anaerobic gram-positive cocci (23 isolates), bacteroides melaninogenicus (14), bacteroides fragilis (9), and fusobacterium nucleatum (11). the most frequent aerobic isolates were alpha-hemolytic streptococci (12), diplococcus pneumoniae (12), pseudomonas aeruginosa (9), klebsiella pneumoniae (7), group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (5), staphylococcus aureus (9), and escherichia coli  (6). all patients responded to the therapy and were cured of the infection. there were no side effects observed from the administration of clindamycin. none of the patients developed any blood dyscrasia, liver damage, diarrhea, or colitis. clindamycin appears to be effective in the treatment of mixed aerobic and anaerobic pleuropulmonary infections in children, alone or with an aminoglycoside when indicated.
