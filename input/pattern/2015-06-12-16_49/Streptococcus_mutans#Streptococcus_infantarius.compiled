TI  - Transcriptional analysis of the gdhA gene in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - AIMS: To study the transcriptional analysis of glutamate dehydrogenase gene, involved in the amino acid conversion to aroma compound in Streptococcus thermophilus. METHODS AND RESULTS: Analysis of the gdhA gene nucleotide sequence of S. thermophilus CNRZ1066 revealed that the coding region is 1353 nucleotides long. The deduced amino acids sequence exhibits the putative GDH active site and some conserved domains characteristic of family I of hexameric GDHs. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the gdh gene of S. thermophilus clustered with the orthologues of other streptococci such as Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus infantarius. Studying the structural organization of the gdhA locus the amino acid similarity of GDHs was higher than 87%, but the locus organization was not conserved. A dominant transcript of approximately 1.4 kbp was revealed by Northern blot hybridization, suggesting that gdhA mRNA is monocystronic. Primer extension showed that transcription start point of gdhA was localized 43 bp upstream of the potential start codon (ATG). CONCLUSIONS: The gdhA represents a monocistronic operon highly conserved in phylogenetic-related bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A deeper knowledge of gdh transcriptional mechanisms could lead to develop S. thermophilus industrial starter cultures with optimized aromatic properties.
TI  - [Evaluation of Prolex for the rapid identification of streptococci isolated in medical microbiology].
AB  - The need to rapidly identify streptococci responsible for acute infectious diseases has led to the development of agglutination techniques that are able to identify streptococcal group antigens (A, B, C, D, F, and G) directly from primoculture colonies on blood agar. The Prolex agglutination tests (Pro-Lab Diagnostics, Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada), distributed in France by i2a, have been used for the determination of group antigens of 166 isolates of streptococci and enterococci previously identified in the National Reference Center for Streptococci. The results obtained with the Prolex reagents have permitted to correctly identify all pyogenic beta-hemolytic streptococci (23 Streptococcus pyogenes, 21 Streptococcus agalactiae, 33 Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis including 6 group C and 27 group G, and 5 Streptococcus porcinus including 4 group B). Four differences between unexpected agglutinations (A or F) and species identifications have been obtained. These differences were observed for four non-hemolytic isolates of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus infantarius, and Streptococcus suis. The anti-D reagent has been of value as a marker for isolates of enterococci. Thus, these results confirm the abilities of these agglutination tests for the grouping of beta-hemolytic streptococci. Moreover, the use of Prolex has the advantage to be rapid because of the non-enzymatic but chemical extraction of streptococcal antigens.
