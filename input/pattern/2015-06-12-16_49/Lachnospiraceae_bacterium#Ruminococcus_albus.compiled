TI  - Determination of bacteria constituting ruminal fibrolytic consortia developed on  orchard grass hay stem.
AB  - To determine the relationship between Fibrobacter succinogenes and other rumen bacteria, the bacterial community structure on fiber was analyzed by using two different materials. These were ruminally incubated orchard grass hay stems without and with preincubation with F. succinogenes (natural and artificial consortia, respectively). The natural consortium mainly consisted of Firmicutes (56.6%) and Bacteroidetes (33.1%), while the artificial consortium showed a significantly higher proportion of Firmicutes (85.5%) and a lower proportion of Bacteroidetes (4.6%). At species or genus level, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, the U2 group, Ruminococcus albus and Lachnospiraceae incertae sedis made up a higher proportion in the artificial consortium. The most dominant bacterial group was the Butyrivibrio-Pseudobutyrivibrio-Lachnospiraceae incertae sedis group, which accounted for 19.7% in the natural and 29.5% in the artificial consortium. Within the genus Butyrivibrio, the phylogenetic groups SA and VA2 and phylogeny-undefined Butyribivrio, but not VA1, were detected at high frequency in the artificial consortium. These results suggest that ecological and possibly functional relationships exist in the rumen among F. succinogenes, a subset of B. fibrisolvens, the U2 group, R. albus and Lachnospiraceae incertae sedis.
