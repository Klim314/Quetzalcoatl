TI  == antimicrobial activity of chemokine cxcl10 for dermal and oral microorganisms.
AB  == cxcl10 (ip-10) is a small 10 kda chemokine with antimicrobial activity. it is induced by ifn-gamma, chemoattracts mononuclear cells, and promotes adhesion of t cells. recently, we detected cxcl10 on the surface of the skin and in the oral cavity. in the current study, we used broth microdilution and radial diffusion assays to show that cxcl10 inhibits the growth of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, corynebacterium jeikeium, corynebacterium striatum, and candida albicans hmv4c, but not corynebacterium bovis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, poryphromonas gingivalis, or c. albicans atcc 64124. the reason for the selective antimicrobial activity is not yet known. however, antimicrobial activity of cxcl10 may be related to its composition and structure, as a cationic 98 amino acid residue molecule with 10 lysine residues,  7 arginine residues, a total net charge of +11, and a theoretical pi of 9.93. modeling studies revealed that cxcl10 contains an alpha-helix at the n-terminal,  three anti-parallel beta-strands in the middle, and an alpha-helix at the c-terminal. thus, cxcl10, when produced on the surface of the skin or in the oral cavity, likely has antimicrobial activity and may enhance innate antimicrobial and cellular responses to the presence of select commensal or opportunistic microorganisms.

TI  == comparison of species identification of endocarditis associated viridans streptococci using rnpb genotyping and 2 maldi-tof systems.
AB  == streptococcus spp. are important causes of infective endocarditis but challenging in species identification. this study compared identification based on sequence determination of the rnpb gene with 2 systems of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, maldi biotyper (bruker) and vitek ms ivd (biomerieux). blood culture isolates of viridans streptococci from 63 patients with infective endocarditis were tested. the 3 methods showed full agreement for all 36 isolates identified in the anginosus, bovis, and mutans groups or identified as streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, or streptococcus sanguinis. none of the methods could reliably identify the 23 isolates to the species level when designated as streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, or streptococcus tigurinus. in 7 isolates classified to the mitis group, the rnpb sequences deviated strikingly from all reference sequences, and additional analysis of soda and groel genes indicated the occurrence of yet unidentified streptococcus spp.

TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == early in vitro and in vivo development of high-level daptomycin resistance is common in mitis group streptococci after exposure to daptomycin.
AB  == the development of high-level daptomycin resistance (hldr; mic of >/= 256 mg/liter) after exposure to daptomycin has recently been reported in viridans group streptococcus (vgs) isolates. our study objectives were as follows: to know whether in vitro development of hldr after exposure to daptomycin was common among clinical isolates of vgs and streptococcus bovis; to determine whether hldr also developed during the administration of daptomycin to treat experimental endocarditis caused by the daptomycin-susceptible, penicillin-resistant streptococcus mitis strain s. mitis 351; and to establish whether combination with gentamicin prevented the development of hldr in vitro and in vivo. in vitro  studies were performed with 114 vgs strains (mitis group, 92; anginosus group, 10; mutans group, 8; and salivarius group, 4) and 54 streptococcus bovis strains  isolated from 168 consecutive patients with infective endocarditis diagnosed between 1995 and 2010. hldr was only observed after 24 h of exposure to daptomycin in 27% of the mitis group, including 27% of s. mitis isolates, 47% of  s. oralis isolates, and 13% of s. sanguis isolates. in our experimental model, hldr was detected in 7/11 (63%) and 8/12 (67%) isolates recovered from vegetations after 48 h of daptomycin administered at 6 mg/kg of body weight/24 h  and 10 mg/kg/24 h, respectively. in vitro, time-kill experiments showed that daptomycin plus gentamicin was bactericidal against s. mitis 351 at tested concentrations of 0.5 and 1 times the mic and prevented the development of hldr.  in vivo, the addition of gentamicin at 1 mg/kg/8 h to both daptomycin arms prevented hldr in 21 out of 23 (91%) rabbits. daptomycin plus gentamicin was at least as effective as vancomycin plus gentamicin. in conclusion, hldr develops rapidly and frequently in vitro and in vivo among mitis group streptococci. combining daptomycin with gentamicin enhanced its activity and prevented the development of hldr in most cases.

TI  == antibacterial activity of sphingoid bases and fatty acids against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == there is growing evidence that the role of lipids in innate immunity is more important than previously realized. how lipids interact with bacteria to achieve  a level of protection, however, is still poorly understood. to begin to address the mechanisms of antibacterial activity, we determined mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of lipids common to the skin and oral cavity--the sphingoid bases d-sphingosine, phytosphingosine, and dihydrosphingosine and the fatty acids sapienic acid and lauric acid--against four gram-negative bacteria and seven gram-positive bacteria. exact kruskal-wallis tests of these values showed differences among lipid treatments (p < 0.0001) for each bacterial species except serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. d-sphingosine (mbc range, 0.3 to 19.6 mug/ml), dihydrosphingosine (mbc range, 0.6 to 39.1 mug/ml), and phytosphingosine (mbc range, 3.3 to 62.5 mug/ml) were active against all bacteria except s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa (mbc > 500 mug/ml). sapienic acid (mbc range, 31.3 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and fusobacterium nucleatum but not active against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa, corynebacterium bovis, corynebacterium striatum, and corynebacterium  jeikeium (mbc > 500 mug/ml). lauric acid (mbc range, 6.8 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against all bacteria except e. coli, s. marcescens, and p. aeruginosa (mbc > 500 mug/ml). complete killing was achieved as early as 0.5 h for some lipids but took as long as 24 h for others. hence, sphingoid bases and fatty acids have  different antibacterial activities and may have potential for prophylactic or therapeutic intervention in infection.

TI  == streptococcus sanguis endocarditis associated with colonic carcinoma.
AB  == infective endocarditis caused by streptococcus bovis is known to be associated with colorectal malignancy. other less common streptococci, specifically streptococcus sanguis, can be similarly associated with gastrointestinal carcinoma. we present a case of disseminated colorectal carcinoma occurring after a confirmed s sanguis endocarditis, that required mitral valve surgery. there may be a need for gastrointestinal surveillance in patients presenting with bacteraemia caused by less common streptococci.

TI  == partial recn gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus streptococcus.
AB  == partial sequences of the recn gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. the partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. the mean dna sequence similarity of recn gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be  lower than those of the 16s rrna gene (94.1 %), rpob (84.6 %), soda (74.8 %), groel (78.1 %) and gyrb (73.2 %). phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: streptococcus salivarius, s. equinus, s. hyovaginalis/s. pluranimalium/s. thoraltensis, s. pyogenes, s. mutans and s. suis. the 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: streptococcus sanguinis/s. cristatus/s. sinensis, s. anginosus/s. intermedius/s. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and s. mitis/s. infantis/s. peroris/s. oralis/s. oligofermentans/s. pneumoniae/s. pseudopneumoniae. the partial recn gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. this observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groel, gyrb, rpob and soda). a high percentage of similarity was found between s. intermedius and s. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recn gene. to study the genetic  diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recn, groel, soda, gyrb and rpob sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. the results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.

TI  == identification of alpha-hemolytic streptococci by pyrosequencing the 16s rrna gene and by use of vitek 2.
AB  == alpha-hemolytic streptococci are very difficult to identify by phenotypic methods. in this study, a pyrosequencing method for the identification of streptococcal species based on two variable regions of the 16s rrna gene is described. almost all studied streptococcal species (n = 51) represented by their type strains could be differentiated except for some closely related species of the streptococcus bovis or s. salivarius group. the pyrosequencing results of alpha-hemolytic streptococci isolated from blood (n = 99) or from the normal pharyngeal microbiota (n = 25) were compared to the results obtained by the vitek 2 with gp card (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france). as expected, the results of  the two methods did not completely agree, but 93 (75.0%) of the isolates assigned to the same streptococcal group by both methods and 57 (46.0%) reached consistent results at the species level. however, 10 strains remained unidentified by vitek  2, and 4 isolates could not be assigned to any streptococcal group by pyrosequencing. identification of members of the s. mitis and s. sanguinis groups proved difficult for both methods. furthermore, the pyrosequencing analysis revealed great sequence variation, since only 43 (32.3%) of the 133 isolates analyzed by pyrosequencing had sequences identical to a type strain. the variation was greatest in the pharyngeal isolates, slightly lower in the blood culture isolates, and nonexistent in invasive pneumococcal isolates (n = 17) that all had the s. pneumoniae type strain sequence. the resolution of the results obtained by the two methods is impeded by the lack of a proper gold standard.

TI  == tigecycline (gar-936) activity against streptococcus gallolyticus (bovis) and viridans group streptococci.
AB  == viridans group streptococci including streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly s. bovis) represent serious invasive pathogens often associated with endocarditis or sepsis among immunocompromised or cancer patients. tigecycline (gar-936), the first clinically studied glycylcycline, has a potent gram-positive activity with  a potential treatment option for these streptococcal infections. the studied collection (848 strains) included 100 isolates each of streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, and fewer  strains of s. gallolyticus (98 strains) and streptococcus mutans (50 strains). these strains were isolated from patients on 3 continents in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program and tested for susceptibility and interpreted  by clinical and laboratory standards institute broth microdilution methods and criteria (< or = 0.25 microg/ml for tigecycline per us food and drug administration). penicillin susceptibility rates for the entire collection varied from 61% (s. sanguis) to 98% (s. constellatus), and macrolide susceptibility was  also compromised (49-88%; average, 69%). tigecycline was active against all isolates tested, in contrast to tetracycline resistance rates of 8-66%, and highest for s. gallolyticus. in conclusion tigecycline was quite active against bacteremic isolates of viridans group streptococci species and s. gallolyticus with an overall mic90 at < or = 0.06 microg/ml; the highest mic was only 0.25 microg/ml.

TI  == binding of porcine ficolin-alpha to lipopolysaccharides from gram-negative bacteria and lipoteichoic acids from gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == protein(s) reactive with n-acetyl-d-glucosamine (glcnac) was isolated from porcine nonimmune serum. the molecular weight of the purified protein was found to be mainly 40 kda on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  under reducing conditions. the n-terminal 10 amino acid sequence of the purified  protein were found to be identical to that of porcine ficolin-alpha reported previously. in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the purified protein was found  to react with lipopolysaccharides (lps) from different gram-negative bacteria such as esherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, salmonella abortus equi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, shigella flexeneri, and serratia marcescens and with lipoteichoic acid (lta) from gram-positive bacteria such as streptococcus sanguis, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. the purified protein also reacted with e. coli o26 isolated from food poisoning and bovine feces and heat-treated gram-positive bacteria such as s. aureus, b. cereus, b. subtilis, enterococcus faecium, and corynebacterum bovis. on the other hand, porcine igg isolated from nonimmune serum showed different reactivity with these lps, lta, and heat-treated bacterial cells. from the present findings, purified porcine serum protein reactive with glcnac is concluded to be ficolin-alpha playing an important role(s) in innate immunity against microbial infection with gram-positive and -negative bacteria.

TI  == changing incidence of detected streptococcal bacteraemia in north yorkshire, england.
AB  == background & objectives: streptococcal bacteraemia remains a major and challenging clinical problem throughout the world. the epidemiology of these infections appears to be changing. in the present study we analysed the data collected over a period of 20 yr (1978-1999) to throw light on this. methods: laboratory records of all patients yielding clinically significant, non-pneumococcal, nonenterococcal streptococcal bacteraemia were reviewed for the decades 1978-1988 and 1990-1999 in the two districts (combined population 260,000). results: from a total of 3134 patients with detected bacteraemia 338 (10.8%) yielded streptococci. the organisms comprised: in the beta-haemolytic group (n=169), gas (32%), gbs (34%), gcs (5%), ggs (28%), grs (1%); in the non-haemolytic/streptococcus milleri group (n=160): s. milleri (21%), s. bovis (10%), s. sanguis (30%), s.mitis (10%), s. oralis (8%) and other 'viridans' streptococci (20%); nine isolates were of anaerobic streptococci. there was a steady increase in the number of blood cultures submitted for investigation during the period and streptococcal isolations of all species rose in proportion  (approximately x 2.5) in the second decade compared with the first. complementary data on the occurrence of necrotising fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome in these districts suggested a real increase in the occurrence of serious forms of gas infection. interpretation & conclusion: an increase in the level of detected streptococcal bacteraemia was seen in this part of england over 20 yr, involving  a wide variety of different streptococcal species. this represented both improved ascertainment of infection and an increase in the burden of disease in the population.

TI  == groesl sequence determination, phylogenetic analysis, and species differentiation for viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the full-length sequences of the groesl genes (also known as cpn10/60) of streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordonii, and  streptococcus sanguis and the near full-length sequence of the groesl genes of streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus salivarius were determined. the lengths of the groes genes from the 10 species listed above ranged from 282 to 288 bp, and the full-length sequences of groel determined for  4 species (s. anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, and s. sanguis) revealed that each was 1,623 bp. the intergenic region (spacer) between the groes and groel genes varies in size (15 to 111 bp) and sequence between species. the variation of the groes sequences among the species tested was greater (62.1 to 95.1% nucleotide sequence identities) than that of the groel sequences (77.2 to 95.2% nucleotide sequence identities). phylogenetic analysis of the groes and groel genes yielded evolutionary trees similar to the tree constructed by use of  the 16s rrna gene. the intraspecies variation of the spacer was minimal for clinical isolates of some species. the groesl sequence data provide an additional parameter for identification of viridans group streptococcal species.

TI  == [susceptibility to penicillin and 13 antimicrobial agents in erythromycin-resistant viridans group streptococci isolated from blood cultures].
AB  == from march 1998 to june 1999, we studied 63 sequential blood culture isolates of  viridans group streptococci which showed a 49% resistance to erythromycin. a high level of resistance to penicillin (46%) was also found. a statistically significant correlation was detected between the two types of resistance. the erythromycin-resistant strains were phenotypically and genotypically characterized, and no differences were found between the resistance to penicillin and the m or mls(b) phenotypes. the penicillin-erythromycin-resistant strains included: 16 s. mitis, five s. sanguis and one s. salivarius. the rank order of activity (% of susceptibility) for all 14 agents against 31 erythromycin- resistant isolates was the following: vancomycin = rifampicin (100) > chloramphenicol (98) > meropenem (65) > cefotaxime (61) > amoxicillin- clavulanic acid (42) > cefepime = ciprofloxacin (39) > tetracycline = trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (36) > cefuroxime (32) > penicillin = ampicillin =  cefaclor (29). the species s. milleri and s. bovis were the most susceptible. the most resistant strains were two s. mitis and one s. sanguis and showed multiresistance to six different groups of antimicrobial agents. the frequent association between macrolide resistance and resistance to other antimicrobial agents suggests that the susceptibility of all clinically significant isolates needs to be evaluated and alternative agents for the prevention and treatment of  viridans group streptococci infections should be identified.

TI  == identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.

(ab titers were > or = 1/512 and igm > or = 1/64 in 30% of patients  1 year later). heterologous ab: in spite of statistically significant difference  found in sie versus the other groups, sensitivity of this test (threshold 1/256)  is low, confidence interval include expected random value (50%), specificity is 88%. conclusions: the utility of homologous ab for diagnosing infective endocarditis is demonstrated. on the contrary for heterologous ab, antigenic common fractions must be found in the different species.

TI  == carcinoma of the colon presenting as streptococcus sanguis bacteremia.
AB  == bacteremia by streptococci that normally inhabit the gastrointestinal tract has been associated with colon carcinoma. such association is best known for streptococcus bovis, but has also been reported for other streptococci. in the present communication a patient is described who presented with streptococcus sanguis bacteremia and was subsequently found to suffer from an adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid. a possible association between bacteremia by commensal streptococci  of both the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract and colon carcinoma is discussed.

TI  == identification of intracellular amylase activity in streptococcus bovis and streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == the ruminal bacterium streptococcus bovis has been demonstrated to produce an extracellular amylase activity. we previously reported on the cloning of a gene from s. bovis encoding for what was initially believed to be the extracellular amylase. dna sequence analyses indicated that the amylase produced by the cloned  gene did not match the n-terminus amino acid sequence of the purified extracellular amylase and contained no apparent leader sequence for secretion. analyses of crude extracts demonstrated the presence of an intracellular amylase  in s. bovis jb1 that differed in molecular weight (56,000) from that of the extracellular amylase (70,000). the 56,000 molecular weight amylase was identical to the amylase produced by escherichia coli containing the cloned amylase gene. low levels of intracellular amylase activity were also detected in other strains  of s. bovis and also streptococcus salivarius. introduction of the plasmid pva838 containing the cloned amylase gene into s. bovis and s. sanguis resulted in enhanced intracellular amylase production by both organisms. the amylase gene has been sequenced, and analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence for the amylase indicates a high degree of similarity with secreted amylases from bacillus species.

AB  == background: the viridans group streptococcus (svg) include species which may have different pathogenic capacity. this study was aimed at evaluating the clinical significance of bacteremia by different species of svg. patients and methods: one hundred ninety-four clinical records of patients with blood culture(s) isolation  (hemoline/biomerieux) of svg (api 20 strep/biomerieux) over 9 years were reviewed with criteria of clinical significance being established and the results analyzed by the chi square test. results: the most frequent species of svg isolated were:  s. sanguis ii (29.4%), s. mitis (27.3%) and s. anginosus (12.9%). with regard to  the criteria established, 36% of the isolates were clinically significant, associating s. anginosus with significant bacteremia (p = 0.001) and s. mitis with non significant bacteremia (p = 0.04). more than half of the isolations of s. anginosus, s. bovis, s. mutans and s. adjacens were clinically significant with this rate being lower in the remaining species (s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii, s. mitis, s. salivarius and s. acidominimus). the significant isolations correspond with endocarditis (s. sanguis ii being responsible for 44%; p = 0.05). in 54.3% of the cases followed by abscesses or other localized infections and severe sepsis in patients with a solid or hematologic tumor with a mortality of 20%. the endocarditis/other disease relation was: greater for the existence of endocarditis for s. sanguis ii, s. sanguis i, s. mutans, s. bovis and s. adjacens; similar in both diseases for s. mitis, and greater for the existence of a non endocardic disease for s. anginosus. conclusions: in this series the isolation of svg group was clinically significant in 36% of cases with a probability of clinical significance and disease association related to the species isolated of svg.

TI  == the presence of two forms of the phosphocarrier protein hpr of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system in streptococci.
AB  == the protein, hpr, a necessary component of the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (pts) in bacteria, was purified from streptococcus salivarius by column chromatography. the purified preparation gave only one band  when analyzed by sodium dodecylsulfate gel electrophoresis or by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel (pi = 4.85). however, electrophoresis in tris-containing buffers under non-denaturing conditions revealed 2 bands that could be phosphorylated by pep in the presence of enzyme i of the pts or by atp with the hpr kinase. homogeneous preparations of these 2 forms could be obtained  by preparative electrophoresis. each preparation exhibited only 1 band when analyzed by electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions, indicating that the  doublet observed before preparative electrophoresis was not an electrophoretic artefact. the electrophoretic mobility of each protein was not modified following heat-treatment at 100 degrees c for 20 min or storage at -40 degrees c for several months. both hpr proteins catalyzed in vitro the pep-dependent phosphorylation of glucose, but at a rate slightly lower than that observed with  a preparation of hpr containing both forms of the protein. both forms were also able to transfer the phosphate group from pep to the other specific pts proteins  known in s salivarius. rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against each form reacted with both proteins. the presence of the 2 forms of hpr was detected in fresh cellular extracts of s salivarius; however, their intracellular ratio varied according to growth conditions. a doublet was also found in many other streptococcal species tested (s mutans, s sobrinus, s sanguis, s thermophilus, s  bovis, s rattus) and also in l lactis.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == properties of a phosphocarrier protein (hpr) extracted from intact cells of streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == cells of streptococcus sanguis strain challis were incubated with sodium lauroylsarcosinate to extract surface proteins. a polypeptide of apparent molecular mass 16 kda comprising about 12% of the extract was purified using anion-exchange chromatography. the polypeptide was shown to be a phosphocarrier protein (hpr) that could also be found in the soluble (cytoplasmic) fraction from cells broken by homogenization with glass beads. in vivo labelling of s. sanguis  cells with 32pi showed that the polypeptide carried a heat- and acid-stable phosphorylation and that during sucrose starvation the hpr became dephosphorylated. antiserum raised to the s. sanguis hpr reacted on western blots with hprs from all oral streptococci tested, together with strains of s. pyogenes and s. salivarius, but not with hprs from s. faecalis or s. bovis, nor with proteins from staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, actinomyces viscosus and  various lactobacilli. the s. sanguis hpr had a high content of alanine (17.2%) and was similar in overall amino acid composition to the hprs from s. mutans an s. salivarius. the n-terminal residues (to 37) of the s. sanguis hpr showed strong sequence identity (82%) with the n-terminal sequence of s. faecalis hpr. it is suggested that hpr in s. sanguis is associated closely with the cytoplasmic membrane. non-disruptive methods of removing cell-surface proteins from streptococci effect release of hpr and possibly other cytoplasmic components.

TI  == classification and identification of the viridans streptococci.
AB  == this review traces the history of the human, nonhemolytic, or viridans, streptococci and describes improvements in their taxonomy wrought by study of their biochemical profiles and analysis of their nucleic acids. the goal was to define species on the basis of genetic relationships and to describe these species by their phenotypic characteristics so that they can be easily identified. this method has resulted in the division of some species. streptococcus mutans has been divided into four species, two of which are common  in humans. three more mutans group species are indigenous to animals. conversely, s. constellatus, s. intermedius, and "s. milleri" have been combined under s. anginosus. s. mitis (or "s. mitior") can be well-defined and includes s. sanguis  ii. there is genetic heterogeneity within s. sanguis, but the species is usually  easy to identify. there is also some heterogeneity in s. bovis, but most human isolates are genetically related. discussions of the taxonomy of these species are accompanied by descriptions of the characteristics by which these streptococci can be identified. among these species are potential pathogens which should be suspected in cases of endocarditis and purulent infections of liver, brain, and other tissues.

TI  == a physiological classification of viridans streptococci by use of the api-20strep system.
AB  == physiological reactions of viridans streptococci were examined by the api-20strep system and a selection of conventional tests. cluster analysis of these results produced a classification similar to a taxonomic scheme based on that of colman and williams. the organisms could be divided into the six recognised species--streptococcus mutans, s. bovis, s. mitior, s. sanguis, s. salivarius and s. milleri. analysis confirmed that s. mitior and s. sanguis can be distinguished in the api-20strep test by hydrolysis of arginine but not by dextran production.  although s. mutans, s. mitior and s. sanguis can be divided into two further subgroups, the taxonomic significance of this is unclear. with this means of classification, most organisms could be identified easily by a small number of tests. api-20strep is convenient for performing physiological tests on viridans streptococci, but the information provided by the manufacturers in regard to identification and nomenclature is in need of revision.

AB  == a total of 287 clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) were  tested for their ability to undergo autolysis when treated with sodium deoxycholate. the test was positive for all but one isolate, strain doc-1. this autolysis required the activity of an enzyme which is unique and characteristic of s. pneumoniae: a choline-dependent n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, the gene product of the lyta gene. we used lyta as a dna probe to test the distribution of the autolysin gene among clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae. in dot blot hybridization experiments our probe reacted with the dna of 60 of 60 strains tested, including the autolysis-deficient clinical isolate doc-1. no hybridization occurred when strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus bovis were tested. the lyta gene appears to be an ideal candidate for use as a dna probe for the identification of s. pneumoniae.

TI  == molecular genetics of resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin b  (mls) in streptococci.
AB  == resistance to macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin b (mls phenotype) appears in  almost all streptococcal species isolated from man. genes coding for mls resistance are located on plasmids and one mls resistance transposon has been described. mls resistance genes have also been found in a large number of plasmid-free strains. plasmids of 17 to 20 megadaltons (mdal) that code either for mls or for both mls and chloramphenicol resistance are found in streptococci  of groups a, b, c, d (streptococcus faecalis) and g. these plasmids have broad host ranges (conjugative intraspecies, interspecies and intergeneric transfer), display similar restriction enzyme patterns and share a considerable degree of homology (78 to 95%). one smaller non-conjugative mls resistance plasmid has been isolated from str. sanguis (4.5 mdal). in group d (str. faecalis, str. faecium) streptococci, mls resistance genes are also found on plasmids that carry other antibiotic resistance (tetracycline, chloramphenicol, high-levels of streptomycin and kanamycin). these multi-resistance plasmids are either conjugative or non-conjugative and are of various sizes and molecular species and those that have been tested have narrow host-ranges. the mls resistance genes of one multi-resistant plasmid, isolated from a strain of str. faecalis, are located on  a transposon of 3.3 mdal, tn917. hybridization studies, with mls determinants as  probes, reveal homologies among various plasmid-borne mls resistance sequences. elements that are thought to be chromosome-borne mediate multiple antibiotic resistance (including mls) in streptococci of groups a, b, c, d (str. bovis), f,  g, str. pneumoniae, str. mitis, str. sanguis and str. milleri. strains harbouring such elements contain no detectable plasmid dna. in some of the strains these elements are conjugative; their resistance markers transfer en bloc at low frequency and display narrow host ranges. such elements, from str. pyogenes and str. agalactiae, were found to translocate onto various streptococcal haemolysin-bacteriocin plasmids.

TI  == comparison of single doses of amoxicillin or of amoxicillin-gentamicin for the prevention of endocarditis caused by streptococcus faecalis and by viridans streptococci.
AB  == recent recommendations for the prophylaxis of endocarditis in humans have advocated single doses or short courses of antibiotic combinations (beta-lactam plus aminoglycoside) for susceptible patients in whom enterococcal bacteremia might develop or for patients at especially high risk of developing endocarditis  (e.g., patients with prosthetic cardiac valves). we tested the prophylactic efficacy (in rats with catheter-induced aortic vegetations) of single doses of amoxicillin plus gentamicin against challenge with various streptococcal strains  (two strains of streptococcus faecalis, one of streptococcus bovis, and three of  viridans streptococci); we then compared this efficacy with that of single doses  of amoxicillin alone. successful prophylaxis against all six strains was achieved with single doses of both amoxicillin alone and amoxicillin plus gentamicin. this protection, however, was limited, for both regimens, to the lowest bacterial-inoculum size producing endocarditis in 90% of control rats and was not extended to higher inocula by using the combination of antibiotics. we concluded  that a single dose of amoxicillin alone was protective against enterococcal and nonenterococcal endocarditis in the rat, but that its efficacy was limited and could not be improved by the simultaneous administration of gentamicin.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of sch 34343 was compared with that of penicillin and cefotaxime against clinical isolates of streptococci. sch 34343 was highly active against streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans streptococci, streptococci of groups a, b, c and g, and str. bovis. ninety per cent of these strains were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25, less than or equal to 0.12 and less than or equal to  0.06 mg/l of sch 34343, penicillin and cefotaxime respectively. activity of sch 34343 against str. faecalis was only moderate. sch 34343 had very good bactericidal activity against group b streptococci, and showed high mbc/mic ratios against penicillin-tolerant viridans streptococci and str. faecalis. sch 34343, 20 mg/l, and gentamicin, 4 mg/l, were synergistic against both of the penicillin-tolerant viridans streptococci, and one-third of the str. faecalis strains.

TI  == cross-reactions between alpha-streptococci and omniserum, a polyvalent pneumococcal serum, demonstrated by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination.
AB  == in recent years several groups have used serological methods to demonstrate pneumococcal capsular antigens in sputum. in the present study 123 strains of alpha-hemolytic streptococci (including 97 strains from sputum or pharyngeal specimens) were tested for cross-reactions with a polyvalent antipneumococcal serum (omniserum). representatives of the following species were included: streptococcus bovis, s. equinus, s. intermedius, s. lactis, s. milleri, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. suis, and aerococcus viridans. serological reactions were detected by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination. fifteen (12%) of the strains  gave positive reactions by all three methods. positive reactions were also observed with another 32 strains (26%) with two of the methods, whereas 37 strains (30%) gave positive reactions by just one technique. altogether 84 (68%)  strains gave positive reactions with one or more of the methods. latex agglutination gave positive reactions with 26 (21%) strains compared with 57 (46%) in immunofluorescence and 63 (51%) in immunoelectroosmophoresis. absorption of the antiserum with one alpha-hemolytic strain reduced but did not entirely eliminate the cross-reactions with five tested strains. these findings indicate a potential risk of cross-reactions with polyvalent antipneumococcal serum in tests carried out on sputa or other specimens which may be contaminated with alpha-hemolytic streptococci.

TI  == in-vitro inhibition of mycobacteria by viridans streptococci.
AB  == eleven strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis and 13 other species of mycobacteria were examined for susceptibility to 26 strains of viridans streptococci. susceptibility was detected by the simultaneous antagonism technique, but not by  tests of deferred antagonism. it is concluded that in-vitro inhibition of mycobacterial growth by actively growing streptococci is due to a peroxide-mediated antagonism which is too variable to be of value for identification. however, a standard bactericidal test with hydrogen peroxide is worth investigation because this might provide a simple inexpensive aid for the identification of m. avium-intracellulare serotypes.

TI  == streptococci isolated from the bloodstream and gingival crevice of man.
AB  == one hundred and twenty six strains of streptococci isolated from the bloodstreams of 123 hospital in-patients--55 with endocarditis--and 255 strains isolated from  the gingival crevices of 66 volunteers were characterised. species isolated were  streptococcus mitior, s. sanguis, undifferentiated viridans streptococci, s. salivarius, s. milleri, s. mutans, s. bovis and s. faecalis. there was no significant difference between the distribution of species in blood and in the gingival crevice. s. mitior and s. sanguis were found less frequently in blood than their presence in the gingival crevice would have suggested, whereas s. milleri was found more frequently. this may indicate that s. milleri is more invasive or that it enters the bloodstream from sources other than the gingival crevice.

TI  == purification and properties of pyruvate kinase from streptococcus sanguis and activator specificity of pyruvate kinase from oral streptococci.
AB  == it was found that pyruvate kinases with two different regulatory characteristics  were distributed among oral streptococci. the pyruvate kinases of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus bovis were activated by glucose 6-phosphate, whereas the enzymes of both streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis were activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. pyruvate kinase  (ec 2.7.1.40) from s. sanguis nctc 10904 was purified, giving a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the enzyme had a molecular weight of 250,000 to 260,000 and consisted of four identical subunits.  whereas the pyruvate kinase from s. mutans was completely dependent on glucose 6-phosphate (k. abbe and t. yamada, j. bacteriol. 149:299-305, 1982), the enzyme  from s. sanguis was activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. in the presence of 0.5 mm fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, the saturation curves for the substrates, phosphoenolpyruvate and adp, were hyperbolic, and the km values were 0.13 and 0.30 mm, respectively. without fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, however, saturation curves for both substrates were sigmoidal. gdp, idp, and udp could replace adp. like the enzyme from s. mutans, the enzyme from s. sanguis required a divalent cation, mg2+ or mn2+, and a monovalent cation, k+ or nh4+, for activity, and it was strongly inhibited by pi. when the concentration of pi was increased, the half-saturating concentration and hill coefficient for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate  increased. the remarkable fluctuation of intracellular levels of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate observed in the cells growing under glucose limitation and nitrogen limitation implies that the intracellular concentration of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, in cooperation with that of pi, may regulate pyruvate kinase activity in s. sanguis in vivo.

TI  == the clinical significance of streptococcal species isolated from cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == alpha-hemolytic (viridans) streptococci are often isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (csf); however, the significance of such isolates is poorly understood. in  order to clarify the clinical significance of isolating these organisms from csf, we did a retrospective analysis of 43 patients, from whom eight different species of alpha-hemolytic streptococci were recovered. eight patients (19%) had significant infections based on bacteriologic, laboratory, and clinical findings. significant infections were associated with s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. intermedius, s. faecalis, and s. bovis. thirty-five patient isolates (81%) from csf were considered as contaminants, with s. mitis being the most frequently isolated organism (49%). direct gram stain of csf sediment, csf glucose concentration, and csf cell differential were clearly abnormal in most patients with significant infections, in contrast to patients with streptococci isolated as contaminants. cultures of the lumbar puncture skin site yielded streptococci and other bacteria, suggesting a possible reservoir for contaminants.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.

TI  == further characteristics of beta2-microglobulin binding to oral streptococci.
AB  == a total of 85 strains of oral bacteria representing streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. mitior, s. salivarious, s. milleri, s. infrequens, s. durans, s. lactis, s. faecalis, s. faecium, s. equinus, streptococcus species group e, actinomyces, and one group a streptococcus were tested for binding of aggregated  human beta 2-microglobulin. positive affinity between bacteria and aggregated human beta 2-microglobulin was detected in 36% of the strains. no apparent correlation with bacterial species, serotype, or group was noted. no positive strains were detected among seven group i:a s. sanguis strains (p < 0.01). binding constants for one s. mutans strain indicated heterogeneous binding structures on the bacterial surface. the number of binding sites for aggregates of human beta 2-microglobulin involving multipoint attachment varied from 70 to 1,700 per bacterial cell. with whole saliva as buffer, a general increase in affinity was seen. variations in salt concentrations of the buffers revealed different salt-dependent species-associated uptake patterns. oral bacteria tended to have an uptake maximum at a salt concentration similar to that seen in saliva. binding structures for aggregated beta 2-microglobulin on oral streptococci were  sensitive to pepsin, heat, and formaldehyde treatment. bacterial binding structures for aggregated beta 2-microglobulin might represent one of several factors of importance for bacterial attachment in the oral cavity. experimental conditions reflecting the salivary milieu increased the degree of interaction, emphasizing the importance of physiological test systems for such studies.

TI  == infective endocarditis, 1970-1979. a study of culture-positive cases in st. thomas' hospital.
AB  == ninety-three episodes of culture-positive endocarditis occurred in 88 patients in the years 1970 to 1979. streptococci caused two-thirds of the cases, with streptococcus mitior and streptococcus sanguis most common. among the group d streptococci, streptococcus bovis was much more common than streptococcus faecalis. staphylococci accounted for a quarter of the episodes. streptococcal endocarditis was commonest in the elderly, whereas staphylococcal endocarditis occurred at all ages. degenerative heart disease was the underlying cardiac factor in nearly half the streptococcal cases, but staphylococci most often affected normal heart valves. when prosthetic valves were infected endocarditis of early onset was staphylococcal but that of late onset was streptococcal. narcotic abuse was a common cause of staphylococcal endocarditis, second only to  surgical wound infection following valve replacement. streptococci affected the mitral and aortic valves equally but the staphylococci more usually involved mitral or tricuspid valves. the overall mortality was 36 per cent but was much higher for staphylococcal than streptococcal endocarditis.

TI  == adherence of glucan-positive and glucan-negative streptococcal strains to normal  and damaged heart valves.
AB  == the adherence of 18 strains of streptococci to sections of normal canine and human aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valves and to canine interatrial septum was compared in an in vitro system. quantitative measurements of adherence ratios were performed by two independent methods. adherence ratios for streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. bovis, and group d streptococci were higher (0.0058-0.0101) than for the other streptococcal strains studied (0.0025-0.0041). with the exception of group d streptococci, adherence ratios for each bacterial strain were similar with the aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valve sections. adherence ratios with normal human and canine valve leaflets were similar, but adherence ratios with interatrial septum were lower than with normal valve sections. adherence ratios for glucan-positive and glucan-negative strains of streptococci with normal and with damaged aortic valve leaflets were also compared. the adherence ratios of the glucan-positive streptococci (s. mutans, s. sanguis, and s. bovis) and one glucan-negative enterococcal strain (kg-3) were approximately five times higher with damaged aortic valves (0.039-0.051) than with normal aortic valves (0.009-0.010). for glucan-positive strains, adherence ratios with normal aortic leaflets were similar when bacteria were grown in media which contains or lacks sucrose. in striking contrast, growth of the glucan-positive strains in medium which lacks sucrose, with resultant deficiency  of glucan production, decreased the adherence ratios with damaged aortic valve leaflets to those found with normal aortic leaflets. treatment of glucan-positive strains with dextranase resulted in a decrease in their adherence ratios to levels seen with bacteria grown in medium lacking sucrose, but the higher adherence ratios could be restored in the presence of exogenous dextran.it is concluded that glucan production is one quantitatively important factor that contributes to the greater adherence of glucan-positive streptococci to damaged rather than to normal aortic heart valve leaflets. however, glucan production is  not the only factor that determines preferential adherence of streptococci to damaged heart valves, because glucan-negative strains may also show some degree of increased adherence to damaged valves. thus, bacterial glucan production is one of the factors that could contribute to the pathogenesis of bacterial endocarditis.

TI  == streptococci and aerococci associated with systemic infection in man.
AB  == a collection of 820 isolates of streptococci and aerococci from human blood or internal organs was classified by means of a set of cultural and biochemical tests. of these, 719 (712 streptococci and 7 aerococci) were from patients believed to be suffering from a systemic infection: endocarditis 317; a purulent  lesion in an internal organ ("purulent disease") 152; bacteriaemia 250. the endocarditis streptococci included members of all recognisable taxa, but only certain of these were common: streptococcus sanguis, 16-4%; dextran-positive and  usually mannitol-fermenting strains of s. bovis (s. bovis i), 15-1%; s. mutans, 14-2%; s. mitior, 13-2%. streptococci of the "alpha-haemolytic" taxa (s. sanguis, s. mitior and related strains) formed only 44-8% of the total. when the percentage frequency of streptococcal taxa among the endocarditis and "non-endocarditis" isolates was compared, the dextran-forming taxa (s. mutans, s. bovis i, s. sanguis, and dextran-positive streptococci otherwise resembling s. mitior) all had higher "endocarditis : non-endocarditis" ratios than did any of the non-dextran-producing taxa. endocarditis increased in frequency with age, and showed an excess of males over females up to the age of 65 years. in young patients (less than 35 years), "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci predominated; with increasing age, the proportion of other streptococci increased progressively but  the absolute numbers of isolations of "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci did not fall. infections with s. mutans were prominent in the age-group 35-54 years and with s. bovis i at ages greater than or equal to 55 years. a history of previous  heart disease was more often obtained in endocarditis due to "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci than in other streptococcal endocarditis. the streptococcus most often isolated from purulent lesions in internal organs was s. milleri (29-3%). it was associated with brain abscess, meningitis, pleural empyema and a variety of intra-abdominal abscesses. the only common predisposing factor in endocarditis was previous heart damage. in other systemic streptococcal diseases, other general or local predisposing causes could be observed, mainly in infections with the "pyogenic" groupable streptococci, the enterococci and s. milleri.

TI  == streptoccus mutans dextransucrase: purification, properties, and requirement for  primer dextran.
AB  == we attempted to purify dextransucrase from s mutans strain 6715 to investigate its properties and determine if multiple species of the enzyme existed. it was concluded that the properties of this enzyme such as the ph (5.5), temperature (37 c) optimum, and km for sucrose (3 mm) are very similar to those reported for  s sanguis, s bovis, s mutans strain omz-176 isozymes, s mutans strain gs-5, and the single dextransucrase purified from s mutans strain hs-6. the ief enzyme preparation consisted of two enzyme species, possibly differing in their ability  to synthesize different dextran linkages. the minor enzyme activity demonstrated  a strict primer dependency. similarly, primer dependency has been reported for dextransucrases from s mutans, s sanguis, and l mesenteroides. s mutans strain 6715 dextransucrase also showed both the insertion and stepwise mechanisms for dextran synthesis. sucrose was the sole glucose donor, whereas dextran was a specific, highly efficient glucose acceptor. the complex primer kinetics are not  fully understood at this time and require further investigation. without linkage  analysis of the products of our enzymes, we can only postulate that each enzyme has a different function in the synthesis of interresidue and interchain alpha1-3 and alpha1-6 bonds. insoluble dextran synthesis may involve a special enzyme mechanism characteristic of s mutans. this synthesis would require both enzymes,  possibly in some aggregated form, with one enzyme synthesizing endogenous primer  dextran. this endogeneous primer or some cell wall polysaccharide could stimulate both enzymes to rapidly synthesize heterogeneously linked insoluble dextran.
