TI  == in vitro spectrum of pexiganan activity when tested against pathogens from diabetic foot infections and with selected resistance mechanisms.
AB  == pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid synthetic cationic peptide, is currently in phase 3 clinical trials as a topical antimicrobial agent for the treatment of mild infections associated with diabetic foot ulcers. bacterial isolates from the 2013 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program designated as pathogens from diabetic foot infections (dfi) and gram-negative and -positive pathogens from various infection types that harbored selected resistance mechanisms/phenotypes were tested against pexiganan in reference cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth. the mic50 and mic90 against all organisms tested from dfi were 16 and 32 mug/ml, respectively. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter koseri, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter species, and pseudomonas aeruginosa mic values ranged from 8 to 16 mug/ml. pexiganan mic values among staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa] and methicillin-susceptible s. aureus [mssa]), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and enterococcus faecium ranged from 8 to 32 mug/ml. pexiganan activity was not adversely affected for members of the  family enterobacteriaceae or p. aeruginosa that produced beta-lactamases or resistance mechanisms to other commonly used antimicrobial agents. decreased susceptibility to vancomycin did not affect pexiganan activity against s. aureus  or e. faecium. enterococcus faecalis appears to be intrinsically less susceptible to pexiganan (mic, 32 to 256 mug/ml). the "all organism" mic90 of 32 mug/ml for pexiganan in this study was >250-fold below the pexiganan concentration in the cream/delivery vehicle being developed for topical use.

TI  == supporting the ceftaroline fosamil/avibactam enterobacteriaceae breakpoint determination using humanised in vivo exposures in a thigh model.
AB  == previous in vivo studies using a human-simulated regimen of ceftaroline/avibactam 600/600mg every 8h (q8h) showed activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-, ampc- and kpc-producing enterobacteriaceae with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) </= 1 mug/ml. here we sought to determine the efficacy of this human-simulated regimen against organisms with mics >/= 1 mug/ml to help determine a breakpoint value that would reliability predict efficacy in humans. in total, 31 isolates (1 escherichia coli, 9 klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 enterobacter cloacae, 1 citrobacter koseri, 2 serratia marcescens, 1 klebsiella oxytoca and 8 pseudomonas aeruginosa) with ceftaroline/avibactam mics of 1 to 16  mug/ml were tested in a murine immunocompromised thigh infection model; 15 isolates were also tested in an immunocompetent model. doses were given to simulate human free drug exposures of ceftaroline fosamil/avibactam 600/600 mg q8h over 24h as a 1-h infusion by targeting the ft>mic profile. efficacy was evaluated as the change in log10 cfu compared with 0-h controls after 24h. reductions in bacterial cfu in the neutropenic model were seen against a majority of isolates tested with mics </= 4 mug/ml, where ft>mic was >55%. more variable efficacy was seen in isolates with mics >/= 8 mug/ml, where ft>mic drops below 40%. overall activity was enhanced in the immunocompetent model. the humanised regimen of ceftaroline fosamil/avibactam 600/600 mg q8h as a 1-h infusion showed  predictable efficacy against isolates with various genotypic and phenotypic profiles and mics </= 4 mug/ml. these data provide valuable information to help determine a ceftaroline/avibactam breakpoint for enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == intraoperative vancomycin use in spinal surgery: single institution experience and microbial trends.
AB  == study design: retrospective case series. objective: to demonstrate the microbial  trends of spinal surgical site infections in patients who had previously received crystallized vancomycin in the operative bed. summary of background data: prior large, case control series demonstrate the significant decrease in surgical site  infection with the administration of vancomycin in the wound bed. methods: a single institution, electronic database search was conducted for all patients who underwent spinal surgery who had received prophylactic crystalline vancomycin powder in the wound bed. patients with a prior history of wound infection, intrathecal pumps, or spinal stimulators were excluded. results: a total of 981 consecutive patients (494 males, 487 females; mean age, 59.4 yr; range, 16-95 yr) were identified from january 2011 to june 2013. the average dose of vancomycin powder was 1.13 g (range, 1-6 g). sixty-six patients (6.71%) were diagnosed with  a surgical site infection, of which 51 patients had positive wound cultures (5.2%). of the 51 positive cultures, the most common organism was staphylococcus  aureus. the average dose of vancomycin was 1.3 g in the 38 cases where a gram-positive organism was cultured. a number of gram-negative infections were encountered such as serratia marcescens, enterobacter aerogenes, bacteroides fragilis, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter koseri, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the average dose of vancomycin was 1.2 g in 23 cases where a gram-negative infection was cultured. fifteen of the 51 positive cultures (29.4%) were polymicrobial. eight (53%) of these 15 polymicrobial cultures contained 3 or more distinct organisms. conclusion: prophylactic intraoperative vancomycin use in the wound bed in spinal surgery may increase the incidence of gram-negative or polymicrobial spinal infections. the use of intraoperative vancomycin may correlate with postoperative seromas, due to the high incidence of nonpositive cultures. large, randomized, prospective trials are needed to demonstrate causation and dose-response relationship.

TI  == increased iga and igm responses against gut commensals in chronic depression: further evidence for increased bacterial translocation or leaky gut.
AB  == background: recently, we discovered that depression is accompanied by increased igm and iga responses directed against gram negative gut commensals. the aim of this study was to replicate these findings in a larger study group of depressed patients and to examine the associations between the iga and igm responses to gut commensals and staging of depression as well as the fatigue and somatic (f&s) symptoms of depression. methods: we measured serum concentrations of igm and iga  against the lps of gram-negative enterobacteria, i.e. hafnia alvei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, morganella morganii, pseudomonas putida, citrobacter koseri, and klebsiella pneumoniae in 112 depressed patients and 28 normal controls. the severity of f&s symptoms was measured using the fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue  syndrome rating scale. results: the prevalences and median values of serum igm and iga against lps of these commensals were significantly higher in depressed patients than in controls. the igm levels directed against the lps of these commensal bacteria were significantly higher in patients with chronic depression  than in those without. the immune responses directed against lps were not associated with melancholia or recurrent depression. there was a significant correlation between the iga response directed against lps and gastro-intestinal symptoms. discussion: the results indicate that increased bacterial translocation with immune responses to the lps of commensal bacteria may play a role in the pathophysiology of depression, particularly chronic depression. bacterial translocation may a) occur secondary to systemic inflammation in depression and intensify and perpetuate the primary inflammatory response once the commensals are translocated; or b) be a primary trigger factor associated with the onset of  depression in some vulnerable individuals. the findings suggest that "translocated" gut commensal bacteria activate immune cells to elicit iga and igm responses and that this phenomenon may play a role in the pathophysiology of (chronic) depression by causing progressive amplifications of immune pathways.

TI  == antibacterial activity of selected medicinal plants against multiple antibiotic resistant uropathogens: a study from kolli hills, tamil nadu, india.
AB  == the increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens necessitates medicinal plants as an alternate therapy in restricting the resistant infectious organisms. in this primitive study, the antibiotic resistance of organisms isolated from urinary tract infected patients was evaluated using the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls)  method and multiple antibiotic resistance (mar) index values, and the mar values  was also calculated for plant extracts. the 10 common medicinal plants collected  from kolli hills, namakkal, south india were extracted using the chloroform, methanol, acetone, ethanol and saponification procedure. the efficacy of the extracts on the uropathogens was tested by agar disc diffusion method in order to analyse the inhibitory activity of plant extract on the organisms. azadiracta indica a. juss., tinospora cordifolia (wild.) and euphorbia hirta linn. exhibited high inhibitory activity against most of the 11 tested organisms followed by cassia javanica linn. and phyllanthus niruri linn. the maximum zone size of 46.3  mm was exhibited by methanol extract of p. niruri linn. against pseudomonas aeruginosa. asparagus racemosus willd. and eupatorium triplinerve vahl had the least activity against resistant pathogens. saponified lipids of most of the plants exhibited maximum antibacterial activity. among the tested organisms, p. aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis were the most susceptible and serratia  marcescens, enterobacter cloaceae, citrobacter koseri, and citrobacter freundii were the least inhibited by most of the extracts of medicinal plants. it is concluded that revised antibiotic policies and more importantly the development of herbal medicine as an alternative may be incorporated in urological practice.

TI  == identification of bacteria isolated from nasal polyps and their ability to produce superantigens and biofilms in lebanese patients.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus superantigens and bacterial biofilms have been implicated in the development of chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. we conducted a study of 32 lebanese patients-21 males and 11 females, aged 15 to 71 years (mean: 39)-to identify bacteria isolated from nasal polyps and to determine if these bacteria produced superantigens and biofilms. polyps were surgically removed, homogenized, and subjected to bacteriologic studies. the presence or absence of s aureus enterotoxin a, b, c, and d (superantigen) genes was determined in all isolates by polymerase chain reaction. biofilm production by coagulase-negative staphylococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa was assessed by tissue culture plate assay. a total of 34 bacterial species/groups were isolated from the nasal polyps. of these, only 3 (8.8%) were s aureus, and only 1 possessed an enterotoxin-coding gene (enterotoxin b). moreover, of the 21 coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates that were found, none possessed the investigated genes, and only 1 had a strong biofilm-formation property. our results could not confirm that s aureus enterotoxins (superantigens) or biofilm-producing bacteria play a role in the development of nasal polyps in the lebanese group studied.

TI  == antimicrobial resistant bacteria among health care workers in intensive care units at ain shams university hospitals.
AB  == fifty hcws in icus of internal medicine, chest, neonatology and burn were included in prospective cohort study. collection of nasal, hand and rectal swabs, proper biochemical identification, culture media and antibiotic sensitivity tests were used to detect methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa); vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) & extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing gram -ve bacilli (esbls). s. aureus was isolated from 34% of hcws; 28%  were nasal carriers, 4% were hand carriers and 2% had s. aureus at both sites. nasal and hand carriage rates of mrsa were 20% & 4% respectively, with an overall rate of 22%. gram -ve bacilli were isolated from 8% of hcws hand swabs & showed citrobacter koseri, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. hand carriage rate of esbls was 2%. hand contamination with gram -ve  bacilli and s. aureus was in 14% of hcws. vre carriage rate was 9.5%. esbls carriage rate in rectal swabs was 21.43%. k. pneumoniae was the most common esbls producing isolate (33.3%), followed by e. coli (18.75%). in combined disc method, aztreonam was the most sensitive (90%) in detecting esbls. burn icu had highest % of mrsa & esbls carriage. neonatal icu showed highest % of vre carriage. an insignificant association was between infection control training or antimicrobial intake and carriage of antimicrobial resistant bacteria.

TI  == normalization of leaky gut in chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs) is accompanied by a  clinical improvement: effects of age, duration of illness and the translocation of lps from gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == background: there is now evidence that an increased translocation of lps from gram negative bacteria with subsequent gut-derived inflammation, i.e. induction of systemic inflammation and oxidative & nitrosative stress (io&ns), is a new pathway in chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs). methods: the present study examines the serum concentrations of iga and igm to lps of gram-negative enterobacteria, i.e. hafnia alvei; pseudomonas aeruginosa, morganella morganii, pseudomonas putida, citrobacter koseri, and klebsielle pneumoniae in cfs patients both before and after intake of natural anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative substances (naioss), such as glutamine, n-acetyl cysteine and zinc, in conjunction with a leaky gut diet during 10-14 months. we measured the above immune variables as well as the fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome rating scale in 41 patients with cfs before and 10-14 months after intake of naioss. results: subchronic intake of those naioss significantly attenuates the initially increased iga and igm responses to lps of gram negative bacteria. up to 24 patients showed a significant clinical improvement or remission 10-14 months after intake of naioss. a good clinical response is significantly predicted by attenuated iga and igm responses to lps, the younger age of the patients, and a shorter duration of  illness (< 5 years). discussion: the results show that normalization of the iga and igm responses to translocated lps may predict clinical outcome in cfs. the results support the view that a weakened tight junction barrier with subsequent gut-derived inflammation is a novel pathway in cfs and that it is a new target for drug development in cfs. meanwhile, cfs patients with leaky gut can be treated with specific naioss and a leaky gut diet.

TI  == [infectious complications of surgically treatment pelvic fractures].
AB  == based on case histories, the authors draw attention to important infectious complications in patients surgically treated for pelvic injuries. these complications were recorded in four out of 75 patients (5.3%) undergoing surgery  for pelvic fracture in the period from 2001 to 2005. the chief risk factors for the development of infection included the poor state of health of a polytraumatized patient in combination with a long stay in an acute care unit, and severe trauma and bleeding of soft tissue structures in b and c types of pelvic injury. bacteriological findings showed the presence of several pathogenic species (enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter koseri, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella oxytoca) or multi-resistant bacteria (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus).

TI  == [nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2006].
AB  == the antibacterial activity of meropenem (mepm) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 876 strains of gram-positive bacteria, 1764 strains  of gram-negative bacteria, and 198 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2006 was measured. the results were as follows; 1. mepm was more active than the other carbapenem antibiotics tested against gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and haemophilus influenzae. mepm was also active against most of the species tested in gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. 2. as for pseudomonas aeruginosa, all of the mepm-resistant strains were resistant to imipenem (ipm). mepm showed low cross-resistant rate both againt ipm-resistant p. aeruginosa (41.8%) and ciprofloxacin-resistant p. aeruginosa (33.3%). 3. the proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) strains was 4.3% (6 strains) in escherichia coli, 1.1% (1 strain) in citrobacter freundii, 21.7% (5 strains) in citrobacter koseri, 3.1% (4 strains) in klebsiella pneumoniae, 3.3% (3 strains) in enterobacter cloacae, 0.8% (1 strain) in serratia marcescens, and 4.9% (2 strains) in providencia spp. the proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 3.1% (10 strains) in p. aeruginosa. 4. of all species tested, there were no species, which mic90 of mepm was more than 4-fold higher than those in our previous study. therefore, there is almost no significant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. in conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that mepm retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem at present, 11 years after available for commercial use.

TI  == the gut-brain barrier in major depression: intestinal mucosal dysfunction with an increased translocation of lps from gram negative enterobacteria (leaky gut) plays a role in the inflammatory pathophysiology of depression.
AB  == there is now evidence that major depression (mdd) is accompanied by an activation of the inflammatory response system (irs) and that pro-inflammatory cytokines and lipopolysacharide (lps) may induce depressive symptoms. the aim of the present study was to examine whether an increased gastrointestinal permeability with an increased translocation of lps from gram negative bacteria may play a role in the pathophysiology of mdd. toward this end, the present study examines the serum concentrations of igm and iga against lps of the gram-negative enterobacteria, hafnia alvei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, morganella morganii, pseudomonas putida, citrobacter koseri, and klebsielle pneumoniae in mdd patients and normal controls. we found that the prevalences and median values for serum igm and iga against lps of enterobacteria are significantly greater in patients with mdd than in normal volunteers. these differences are significant to the extent that a significant diagnostic performance is obtained, i.e. the area under the roc curve is 90.1%. the symptom profiles of increased igm and iga levels are fatigue, autonomic and gastro-intestinal symptoms and a subjective feeling of infection. the results show that intestinal mucosal dysfunction characterized by an increased translocation of gram-negative bacteria (leaky gut) plays a role in the inflammatory pathophysiology of depression. it is suggested that the increased lps translocation may mount an immune response and thus irs activation in some patients with mdd and may induce specific "sickness behaviour" symptoms. it is suggested that patients with mdd should be checked for leaky gut by means of the  igm and iga panel used in the present study and accordingly should be treated for leaky gut.

TI  == increased serum iga and igm against lps of enterobacteria in chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs): indication for the involvement of gram-negative enterobacteria in the etiology of cfs and for the presence of an increased gut-intestinal permeability.
AB  == there is now evidence that chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs) is accompanied by immune disorders and by increased oxidative stress. the present study has been designed in order to examine the serum concentrations of iga and igm to lps of gram-negative enterobacteria, i.e. hafnia alvei; pseudomonas aeruginosa, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas putida, citrobacter koseri, and klebsiella pneumoniae in cfs patients, patients with partial cfs and normal controls. we found that the prevalences and median values for serum iga against the lps of enterobacteria are significantly greater in patients with cfs than in  normal volunteers and patients with partial cfs. serum iga levels were significantly correlated to the severity of illness, as measured by the fibrofatigue scale and to symptoms, such as irritable bowel, muscular tension, fatigue, concentration difficulties, and failing memory. the results show that enterobacteria are involved in the etiology of cfs and that an increased gut-intestinal permeability has caused an immune response to the lps of gram-negative enterobacteria. it is suggested that all patients with cfs should be checked by means of the iga panel used in the present study and accordingly should be treated for increased gut permeability.

TI  == fishmeal extract bile salt lactose agar--a differential medium for enteric bacteria.
AB  == fishmeal extract bile salt lactose agar (febla), a new differential medium for enteric bacteria was developed and evaluated for its ability to grow and differentiate lactose fermenters (lf) from non-lactose fermenters (nlf) in comparison with macconkeys agar. performance of febla was at par with the latter. on febla medium, the contrast between lf and nlf colonies was pronounced and klebsiella pneumoniae produced more mucoid colonies than on macconkeys agar (hi media). unlike macconkeys agar, a 24 h culture of k. pneumoniae cells on febla were longer and thicker with abundant capsular material around the bacilli. escherichia coli produced long and thick cells but only after 48h. no change in cell morphology was evident with regard to salmonella typhi, s. paratyphi a, shigella flexneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, citrobacter koseri and acinetobacter baumannii. performance of the medium was controlled using e. coli and s. flexneri. febla is simple, cost effective and may be a suitable alternative in the preliminary identification of enteric bacteria.

TI  == frequency and diversity of class a extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in hospitals of the auvergne, france: a 2 year prospective study.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the frequency and diversity of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) produced by enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in one french region. methods: during 2001-2002, all the non-duplicate isolates of p. aeruginosa resistant to ceftazidime and of enterobacteriaceae intermediate  or resistant to ceftazidime and/or cefotaxime and/or aminoglycosides with an aac(6') i phenotype were collected in nine hospitals of the area. esbl isoelectric points were determined, bla genes were amplified and sequenced and epidemic isolates were genotyped with eric2-pcr. results: esbls were observed in  297 enterobacteriaceae (0.8%). the most frequent were tem-3 like (n=152; 51.2%) and tem-24 (n=115; 38.7%). four new enzymes were observed, tem-112 (pi 5.4), tem-113 (pi 6.3), tem-114 (pi 5.9) and tem-126 (pi 5.4). other tems were tem-8, tem-12, tem-16, tem-19, tem-20, tem-21, tem-29 and tem-71. the other esbls were shv-4, shv-5 and shv-12, ctx-m-1, ctx-m-3, ctx-m-14 and ctx-m-15. in 37 p. aeruginosa (0.7%) only one esbl was observed, per-1. five epidemic strains were detected, serratia marcescens tem-3 and four observed in several hospitals, enterobacter aerogenes tem-24, citrobacter koseri tem-3, proteus mirabilis tem-3  and p. aeruginosa per-1. conclusion: esbl frequency was lower than in 1998, and ctx-m-type frequency higher (2.1% of esbls in 2001, 4.9% in 2002). this long-term survey detected new sporadic enzymes (tem-112, tem-113, tem-114 and tem-126) and  interhospital epidemic strains while avoiding any overestimation of esbl frequency that may otherwise have occurred because of acute epidemics.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI  == anaerobic cocci populating the deep tissues of chronic wounds impair cellular wound healing responses in vitro.
AB  == background: anaerobic cocci are estimated to be present in the deep tissues of over 50% of chronic skin wounds. while the part they play in the chronicity of these wounds is uninvestigated, anaerobic cocci have previously been shown to be  involved in other chronic inflammatory human conditions. methods: in this study the anaerobic microflora of the deep tissues of 18 patients with refractory chronic venous leg ulcers (mean age 80.3 years; mean duration > 24 months) was characterized using strict anaerobic culture conditions. the effect of the anaerobic organisms isolated from these tissues on extracellular matrix (ecm) proteolysis and cellular wound healing responses was studied using in vitro models. results: anaerobic organisms were present in the deep tissues of 14 of 18 wounds and were principally peptostreptococcus spp. the effects of three peptostreptococcus spp. isolated from these wounds (p. magnus, p. vaginalis and p. asaccharolyticus) on cellular wound healing responses were compared with those of two pathogenic organisms also isolated from these wounds (pseudomonas aeruginosa and citrobacter diversus). while the direct ecm proteolytic activity exhibited by the peptostreptococcus spp. was limited, they did significantly inhibit both fibroblast and keratinocyte proliferation, but only at high concentrations. however, at lower concentrations peptostreptococcal supernatants  profoundly inhibited keratinocyte wound repopulation and endothelial tubule formation. the magnitude of these effects varied between strains and they were distinct from those demonstrated by pseudomonas aeruginosa and citrobacter diversus. conclusions: these studies confirm the importance of anaerobic organisms in chronic wounds and demonstrate an indirect, strain-specific mechanism by which these microorganisms may play a part in mediating the chronicity of these wounds.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, and carbapenems.  thirty-two species 2,697 strains of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of  moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis (n = 125), escherichia coli (n = 250), citrobacter freundii (n = 153), citrobacter koseri (n = 97), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 150), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 100), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 50), enterobacter cloacae (n = 125), serratia marcescens (n = 153), proteus mirabillis (n = 103), proteus vulgaris (n = 77), morganella morganii (n = 141), providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii; n = 154), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 211), pseudomonas putida (n = 49), burkholderia cepacia (n = 102), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 101), haemophilus influenzae (n = 210), acinetobactor baumannii (n = 63), acinetobactor iwoffii (n = 30), bacteroides fragilis group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron; n = 129), and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola; n = 124). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lowffii throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae  yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained  the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however,  the decrease in the antibacterial activity of czop against h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. changes in czop susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), escherichia coli (n = 276), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), enterobacter  aerogenes (n = 93), serratia marcescens (n = 172), serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), citrobacter freundii (n = 177), citrobacter koseri (n = 70), proteus mirabilis (n = 113), proteus vulgaris (n = 89), morganella morganii (n = 116), providencia spp. (n = 41), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), pseudomonas putida (n = 63), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and prevotella/porphyromonas (n = 173). an antibacterial activity of czop against e.  coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and s. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against m.(b.) catarrhalis, c. koseri, and p. aeruginosa  was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and p. mirabilis increased year by year. the increase in mic90 of czop against e. aerogenes and p. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. in contract, the susceptibility of e. cloacae  to czop was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to czop. mic90 of czop against c. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. additionally, mic90 of czop against h. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little  higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. an antibacterial activity of czop against p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. cepacia, s.  maltophilia, b. fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. changes in mic90 of czop against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.

TI  == the effects of plant phenolics, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid and ferulic acid on arylamine n-acetyltransferase activities in human gastrointestinal microflora.
AB  == the possible effects of naturally occurring plant phenolics, caffeic acid (ca), chlorogenic acid (cga) and ferulic acid (fa) on arylamine n-acetyltransferase (nat) activities on human gastrointestinal microflora, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter koseri and pseudomonas aeruginosa, were examined. the bacterial nat activities were determined by hplc measuring the acetylation of 2-aminofluorene (2-af). among all examined bacteria, p. aeruginosa exerted the highest nat activity while c. koseri possessed the lowest nat activity. ca, cga and fa could suppress the bacterial nat activities dose-dependently both in the intact cell and cytosolic fraction analysis. according to the analysis of kinetic parameters in e. coli and p. aeruginosa, ca, cga and fa were shown to be potent noncompetitive inhibitors of bacterial nat activities. for the time course experiment, 4 mm of ca and fa could inhibit bacterial nat activities for at least 4 hour but 4 mm of cga could only significantly suppress nat activity in e. coli for the same reaction time. these  results strongly demonstrated that ca, cga and fa inhibited nat activities in human gastrointestinal bacteria.

TI  == infectious crystalline keratopathy caused by gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == purpose: to identify the characteristics and outcomes of infectious crystalline keratopathy caused by gram-negative bacteria. methods: we reviewed all patients treated at a university eye center for infectious crystalline keratopathy from 1978 through 1995 and performed a nested case-comparison study by comparing patients with keratitis caused by gram-negative rods and those with keratitis caused by gram-positive cocci. results: eighteen patients (mean age +/- sd, 59 +/- 17 years) displayed unilateral culture-positive infectious crystalline keratopathy. among 18 eyes with crystalline keratopathy, five occurrences (28%) were caused by gram-negative rods (acinetobacter lwoffi, citrobacter koseri, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia), 10 (55%) were caused primarily by gram-positive cocci, and three (17%) were caused primarily by yeasts. four cases grew two different isolates. no significant difference in predisposing factors, clinical appearance, or visual outcome was found between infections caused by gram-negative bacteria and those caused by gram-positive bacteria. conclusions: gram-negative bacteria can cause infectious crystalline keratopathy but have no distinguishing features from infectious crystalline keratopathy caused by streptococci and other gram-positive bacteria. appropriate laboratory evaluation is therefore necessary to guide specific antimicrobial therapy.
