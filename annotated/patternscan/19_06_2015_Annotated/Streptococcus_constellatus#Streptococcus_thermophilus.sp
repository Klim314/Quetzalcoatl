TI  == study of the intra- and interlaboratory reproducibility of partial single base c-sequencing of the 16s rrna gene and its applicability for the identification of members of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == the use of single base c-sequencing of the first 500 bases of the 16s rrna-gene (sbcs) combined with capillary electrophoresis was evaluated for the identification of reference strains of 30 different species within the genus streptococcus. for sbcs, only dd-ctp's are used in the sequencing reactions instead of the four dideoxy bases and the primer is fluorescently labeled. the reproducibility, interlaboratory exchangeability and discriminative power of this method were studied by comparing the patterns obtained in three laboratories under highly standardized conditions. the interlaboratory reproducibility proved  to be high, enabling the construction of a common database for the identification of strains belonging to the streptococcal species studied. most of the examined species generated distinguishable profiles. sbcs did not differentiate between the closely related species s. constellatus and s. intermedius. also s. thermophilus and s. vestibularis as well as s. mitis and s. pneumoniae showed highly resembling profiles. the previously reported heterogeneity within the species s. equinus was reflected by sbcs. for all other species, strains belonging to the same species generated indistinguishable patterns. in conclusion, single base c-sequencing of the first 500 bases of the 16s rrna-gene  could be a useful and widely applicable method for the identification of bacteria at the species level, with the added advantage of being more rapid and easier to  automatize than full sequence determination.

TI  == identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.
