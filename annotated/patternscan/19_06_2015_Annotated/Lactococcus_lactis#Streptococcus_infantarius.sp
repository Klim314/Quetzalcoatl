TI  == comparative genomics of the dairy isolate streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198 against related members of the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex.
AB  == background: within the genus streptococcus, only streptococcus thermophilus is used as a starter culture in food fermentations. streptococcus macedonicus though, which belongs to the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec), is also frequently isolated from fermented foods mainly of dairy origin. members of the sbsec have been implicated in human endocarditis and colon cancer. here we compare the genome sequence of the dairy isolate s. macedonicus aca-dc 198 to the other sbsec genomes in order to assess in silico its potential adaptation to milk and its pathogenicity status. results: despite the fact that the sbsec species were found tightly related based on whole genome phylogeny of streptococci, two distinct patterns of evolution were identified among them. streptococcus macedonicus, streptococcus infantarius cj18 and streptococcus pasteurianus atcc 43144 seem to have undergone reductive evolution resulting in significantly diminished genome sizes and increased percentages of potential pseudogenes when compared to streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus. in addition, the three species seem to have lost genes for catabolizing complex plant carbohydrates and for detoxifying toxic substances previously linked to the ability of s. gallolyticus to survive in the rumen. analysis of the s. macedonicus genome revealed features that could support adaptation to milk, including an extra gene cluster for lactose and galactose metabolism, a proteolytic system for casein hydrolysis, auxotrophy for several vitamins, an increased ability to resist bacteriophages and horizontal gene transfer events with the dairy lactococcus lactis and s. thermophilus as potential donors. in addition, s. macedonicus lacks several pathogenicity-related genes found in s. gallolyticus. for example, s. macedonicus has retained only one (i.e. the pil3) of the three pilus gene clusters which may mediate the binding of s. gallolyticus to the extracellular matrix. unexpectedly, similar findings were obtained not only for the dairy s. infantarius cj18, but also for the blood isolate s. pasteurianus atcc 43144. conclusions: our whole genome analyses suggest traits of adaptation of s. macedonicus to the nutrient-rich dairy environment. during this  process the bacterium gained genes presumably important for this new ecological niche. finally, s. macedonicus carries a reduced number of putative sbsec virulence factors, which suggests a diminished pathogenic potential.

TI  == the dominant microbial community associated with fermentation of obushera (sorghum and millet beverages) determined by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == obushera includes four fermented cereal beverages from uganda namely: obutoko, enturire, ekitiribita and obuteire, whose microbial diversity has not hitherto been fully investigated. knowledge of the microbial diversity and dynamics in these products is crucial for understanding their safety and development of appropriate starter cultures for controlled industrial processing. culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques including denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and mixed dna sequencing of polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) amplified ribosomal rna genes were used to study the bacteria and  yeast diversity of obushera. the ph dropped from 6.0-4.6 to 3.5-4.0 within 1-2 days for obutoko, enturire and obuteire whereas that of ekitiribita decreased to  4.4 after 4 days. counts of lactic acid bacteria (lab) increased from 5.0 to 11.0 log cfug(-1) and yeasts increased from 3.4 to 7.1 log cfug(-1) while coliform counts decreased from 2.0 to <1 log cfug(-1) during four days of fermentation. lab and yeast isolates were identified by rrna gene sequence analysis. lab isolates included: enterococcus spp., lactobacillus (lb.) plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus (s.) infantarius subsp. infantarius, pediococcus pentosaceus and weisella (w.) confusa. dgge indicated predominance of s. gallolyticus, s. infantarius subsp. infantarius, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, w. confusa, lb. reuteri, fructobacillus spp., l. lactis and l. lactis. yeast isolates included clavispora  lusitaniae, cyberlindnera fabianii, issatchenkia orientalis and saccharomyces cerevisiae. dgge indicated predominance of s. cerevisiae in obutoko, enturire and obuteire and also detected pichia spp. and i. orientalis in obutoko. obushera produced in the laboratory was initially dominated by enterobacteriaceae and later by lactococcus spp. enterobacteriaceae and bacillus spp. were also detected in ekitiribita. development of starters for obushera may require combinations of  lab and s. cerevisiae for obutoko, enturire and obuteire and lab for ekitiribita.

TI  == molecular characterization of a novel mosaic tet(s/m) gene encoding tetracycline  resistance in foodborne strains of streptococcus bovis.
AB  == the presence of antibiotic-resistance (ar) genes in foodborne bacteria of enteric origin represents a relevant threat to human health in the case of opportunistic  pathogens, which can reach the human gut through the food chain. streptococcus bovis is a human opportunistic pathogen often associated with infections in immune-compromised or cancer patients, and it can also be detected in the environment, including fermented foods. we have focused on the molecular characterization of a tetracycline (tet)-resistance gene present in 39 foodborne  isolates of s. bovis phenotypically resistant to this drug. the gene was identified as a novel tet(s/m) fusion, encoding a mosaic protein composed of the  n-terminal 33 amino acids of tet(s), in-frame with the tet(m) coding sequence. heterologous expression of the mosaic gene was found to confer tet resistance upon escherichia coli recipients. moreover, the tet(s/m) gene was found to be transcriptionally inducible by tet under the endogenous tet(s) promoter in both s. bovis and e. coli. nucleotide sequencing of the surrounding genomic region of  16.2 kb revealed large blocks of homology with the genomes of streptococcus infantarius and lactococcus lactis. a subregion of about 4 kb containing mosaic tet(s/m) was flanked by two copies of the is1216 mobile element. pcr amplification with primers directed outwards from the tet(s/m) gene identified the presence of a 4.3 kb circular form corresponding to the intervening chromosomal region between the two is1216 elements, but lacking a replication origin. the circular element shared extensive overall homology with a region of the multidrug-resistance plasmid pk214 from lc. lactis, containing tet(s), as well as the is1216 transposase-containing element and intervening non-coding sequences. linear reconstruction of the insertion events likely to have occurred  within this genomic region, inferred from sequence homology, provides further evidence of the chromosomal rearrangements that drive genomic evolution in complex bacterial communities such as the gut and food microbiota.

TI  == the spifeg locus in streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius baa-102 confers  protection against nisin u.
AB  == nisin u is a member of the extended nisin family of lantibiotics. here we identify the presence of nisin u immunity gene homologues in streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius baa-102. heterologous expression of these genes in lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris hp confers protection to nisin u and other members of the nisin family, thereby establishing that the recently identified phenomenon of resistance through immune mimicry also occurs with respect to nisin.

TI  == reidentification of streptococcus bovis isolates causing bacteremia according to  the new taxonomy criteria: still an issue?
AB  == all streptococcus bovis blood culture isolates recovered from january 2003 to january 2010 (n = 52) at the hospital universitario ramon y cajal were reidentified on the basis of their genetic traits using new taxonomic criteria. initial identification was performed by the semiautomatic wider system (fco. soria-melguizo, spain) and the api 20 strep system (biomerieux, france). all isolates were reidentified by pcr amplification and sequencing of both the 16s rrna and soda genes and by mass spectrometry using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms; bruker, germany). results of 16s rrna/soda gene sequencing were as follows: streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, 14/14 (number of isolates identified by 16s rrna/number of isolates identified by soda gene sequencing); streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, 24/24; streptococcus spp., 7/0; streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius, 0/2; streptococcus lutetiensis, 0/5; leuconostoc  mesenteroides, 4/0; and lactococcus lactis, 3/3. maldi-tof ms identified 27 s. gallolyticus isolates but not at the subspecies level, 4 l. mesenteroides isolates, 3 l. lactis isolates, and 6 s. lutetiensis isolates, whereas 12 isolates rendered a nonreliable identification result. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis grouped all s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus isolates into 3 major clusters clearly different from those of the s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus isolates, which, in turn, exhibited no clonal relationship. the percentages of resistance to the tested antimicrobials were 38% for erythromycin, 23% for fosfomycin, 10% for levofloxacin, 6% for tetracycline, and 4% for co-trimoxazole. the most frequent underlying diseases were hepatobiliary disorders (53%), endocarditis (17%), and malignancies (12%). we conclude that sequencing of the soda gene was the most discriminatory method and that s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus appears to have a higher genetic diversity than  s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus.
