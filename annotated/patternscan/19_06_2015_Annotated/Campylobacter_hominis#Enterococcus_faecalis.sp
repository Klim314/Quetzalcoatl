TI  == comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  == lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. in this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated  antimicrobials. lomefloxacin was very active against enterobacteriaceae (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). in common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of neisseria spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), haemophilus spp. (mic90, less  than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), legionella spp. (mic90, less than or equal  to 0.06 micrograms/ml), vibrio spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 1 microgram/ml). lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of bacteroides spp. (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) or clostridium difficile mic90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of clostridium perfringens (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), peptostreptococcus spp. (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), chlamydia trachomatis (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), mycoplasma hominis (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), and urea-plasma urealyticum (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the mic with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of escherichia coli and s. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the mic. these results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections  caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by s. aureus.
