TI  == assessment of periodontal and opportunistic flora in patients with peri-implantitis.
AB  == aim: to assess the presence of periodontal and opportunistic organisms in patients with peri-implantitis. material and methods: thirty-three partially edentulous subjects (22 women, 11 men), aged 32-90 years, who had one or more implants with peri-implantitis were included. peri-implantitis was defined as: (i) the presence of bleeding on probing and/or suppuration and (ii) radiographic  images showed marginal bone loss >1.8 mm after 1 year in function. criteria for inclusion were: (i) partially edentulous patients having at least one implant diagnosed with peri-implantitis; (ii) no antibiotic therapy for 6 months prior to clinical examination. following this definition, a total of 48 implants were diagnosed with peri-implantitis. subgingival bacterial samples were obtained with sterile paper points from infected implants and selected teeth of each individual. periodontopathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) were detected by multiplex pcr targeting 16s rdna. samples were placed in reduced transport medium and cultured for opportunistic pathogens  (staphylococcus aureus, enteric bacteria, pseudomonas and yeasts). results: twenty-two patients yielded positive results for p. gingivalis, 25 for t. forsythia, eight for p. intermedia and 13 for t. denticola. none of the patients  yielded a positive result for a. actinomycetemcomitans. non-periodontal species were found in five patients (15% of total). p. aeruginosa was found in four (12%) patients, and c. albicans (3%) and s. aureus in one patient (3%) each. in two cases of peri-implantitis, none of the periodontal or opportunistic microorganisms studied were detected in either implant or tooth samples. when results of the periodontopathic bacteria from the implant and tooth samples of the same patient were compared, 18 patients (54%) showed the same results for both samples and 15 (45%) patients different results. conclusions: the implant surface may be colonized with pathogens different from periodontal bacteria. opportunistic pathogens such as p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and c. albicans may be associated with implant failure.

TI  == the short-term treatment effects on the microbiota at the dorsum of the tongue in intra-oral halitosis patients--a randomized clinical trial.
AB  == objectives: this study aims to assess the effects of rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse with or without adjunct tongue scraping on volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) in breath air, and the microbiota at the dorsum  of the tongue. material and methods: a randomized single-masked controlled clinical trial with a cross-over study design over 14 days including 21 subjects  was performed. bacterial samples from the dorsum of the tongue were assayed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: no halitosis (identified by vsc assessments) at day 14 was identified in 12/21 subjects with active rinse alone,  in 10/21 with adjunct use of tongue scraper, in 1/21 for negative control rinse alone, and in 3/21 in the control and tongue scraping sequence. at day 14, significantly lower counts were identified only in the active rinse sequence (p < 0.001) for 15/78 species including, fusobacterium sp., porphyromonas gingivalis,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and tannerella forsythia. a decrease in bacteria from baseline to day 14 was found in successfully treated subjects for 9/74 species including: p. gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica, s. aureus, and treponema denticola. baseline vsc scores were correlated with several bacterial species. the use of a tongue scraper combined with active rinse did not change the levels of vsc compared to rinsing alone. conclusions: vsc scores were  not associated with bacterial counts in samples taken from the dorsum of the tongue. the active rinse alone containing zinc and chlorhexidine had effects on intra-oral halitosis and reduced bacterial counts of species associated with malodor. tongue scraping provided no beneficial effects on the microbiota studied. clinical relevance: periodontally healthy subjects with intra-oral halitosis benefit from daily rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse.

TI  == susceptibility of some oral microorganisms to chlorhexidine and paramonochlorophenol.
AB  == since the use of antimicrobial agents is required in endodontic therapies, this study aimed at determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of chlorhexidine digluconate and paramonochlorophenol (pmc) against microorganisms commonly found in endodontic infections. both agents were tested by agar dilution tests against pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, candida albicans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella denticola and prevotella melaninogenica. the mic of chlorhexidine ranged from 2.67 to 80.00 microg/ml, and the mic of pmc from 46.67 to 213.33 microg/ml. the highest mic value of pmc was detected for e. faecalis whereas e. coli was the most susceptible microorganism to this agent. the highest mic values of chlorhexidine  were observed for p. aeruginosa whereas e. coli and p. denticola were the most susceptible microorganisms to this agent. since the mic values observed are much  lower than the concentrations currently used in the endodontic therapy, it is suggested that both agents are effective in reducing the microbiota in the root canal.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == clinical and microbiological features of refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the clinical parameters and the  site prevalence and levels of 40 subgingival species in successfully treated and  refractory periodontitis subjects. 94 subjects received scaling and root planing  and if needed, periodontal surgery and systemically administered tetracycline. 28 refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or > 3 sites showing attachment loss > 2.5 mm within 1 year post-therapy. 66 successfully treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss > 2.5 mm. baseline subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the mean levels and % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject and differences between groups sought using the mann-whitney test. most of the 40 species tested, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus, were equally or less prevalent in the refractory group. prevotella nigrescens was significantly more prevalent in successfully treated subjects, while refractory subjects harbored a larger proportion of streptococcus species, particularly streptococcus constellatus. the odds of a subject being refractory was 8.6 (p < 0.001) if s. constellatus constituted > or = 3.5% of the  total dna probe count. since few microbiological differences existed between treatment outcome groups using dna probes to known species, the predominant cultivable microbiota of 33 subgingival samples from 14 refractory subjects was examined. 85% of the 1649 isolates were identified using probes to 69 recognized  subgingival species. the remaining unidentified strains were classified by analyzing 16s rrna gene sequences. many sequenced isolates were of taxa not considered a common part of the oral microbiota such as acinetobacter baumanni, gemella haemolysans, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus warneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa and novel species in the genera bartonella, ralstonia, neisseria, eubacterium, rothia, gordona, gemella, corynebacterium, leptotrichia, and actinomyces. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their subgingival microbiota. as a group, they did not harbor more of the "classic" periodontopathogens, although elevated proportions of s. constellatus were found.
