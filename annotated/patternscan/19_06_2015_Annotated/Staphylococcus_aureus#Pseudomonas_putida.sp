TI  == conjunctival flora of clinically normal and diseased turtles and tortoises.
AB  == background: in captive breed turtles and tortoises conjunctival disease is common. our aim was to investigate the bacterial and fungal flora present in the  eyes of healthy and pathological chelonians and to compare findings in turtles with those in tortoises. results: samples were taken from the conjunctival sacs of 34, diseased and healthy, chelonians (18 tortoises and 16 turtles) and submitted to bacterial and fungal investigation. all samples showed bacterial growth. thirteen animals (38%), harboured a single bacterial species as sole isolate and twenty-one animals (62%) harboured more than one species. detection of multiple bacterial infection was clearly greater in tortoises compared to turtles. most frequently isolated bacterial species were bacillus spp. (13 isolates), staphylococcus xylosus (10 isolates), sphingomonas paucimobilis (6 isolates), staphylococcus sciuri and aeromonas hydrophila/caviae (each 5 isolates), ochrobactrum anthropi (3 isolates), citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas luteola (each 2 isolates). only one isolate of kocuria varians/rosea, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus auricularis, staphylococcus  haemolyticus, staphylococcus lentus, morganella morganii, pasteurella multocida,  pasteurella pneumotropica/haemolytica, proteus spp., pseudomonas putida, salmonella enterica ssp. arizonae, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and vibrio parahaemolyticus was evidenced. the presence in 8 animals of mycoplasma spp. and  in 1 animal with severe conjunctivitis of chlamydia spp. was detected by pcr. candida spp. was also isolated from two healthy animals. conclusions: a clear predominance of gram positive isolates in tortoises and gram negative isolates in turtles was found. however, we cannot ascribe the observed difference to the diversity of animal species, as other factors, including especially different characteristics of the living environments, may play a role. almost all bacterial species isolated may have clinical significance, mostly as opportunistic pathogens, both for humans and animals. that chelonians are often carrier of bacteria with zoonotic potential is a well-known fact, in particular with regard  to salmonella spp. therefore, it is not surprising the detection of a strain of salmonella enterica ssp. arizonae in the eye of one of the animals tested. worthy of note is the finding of chlamydia spp. in a severe case of conjunctivitis, though we cannot epidemiologically assess a cause-effect relationship between presence of chlamydia and disease.

TI  == draft genome sequence analysis of a pseudomonas putida w15oct28 strain with antagonistic activity to gram-positive and pseudomonas sp. pathogens.
AB  == pseudomonas putida is a member of the fluorescent pseudomonads known to produce the yellow-green fluorescent pyoverdine siderophore. p. putida w15oct28, isolated from a stream in brussels, was found to produce compound(s) with antimicrobial activity against the opportunistic pathogens staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae, an unusual characteristic for p. putida. the active compound production only occurred in media with low iron content and without organic nitrogen sources. transposon mutants which lost their antimicrobial activity had the majority of insertions in genes involved in the biosynthesis of pyoverdine, although purified pyoverdine was not responsible for the antagonism. separation of compounds present in culture supernatants revealed the presence of two fractions containing highly hydrophobic molecules active against p. aeruginosa. analysis of the draft genome  confirmed the presence of putisolvin biosynthesis genes and the corresponding lipopeptides were found to contribute to the antimicrobial activity. one cluster  of ten genes was detected, comprising a nad-dependent epimerase, an acetylornithine aminotransferase, an acyl coa dehydrogenase, a short chain dehydrogenase, a fatty acid desaturase and three genes for a rnd efflux pump. p.  putida w15oct28 genome also contains 56 genes encoding tonb-dependent receptors,  conferring a high capacity to utilize pyoverdines from other pseudomonads. one unique feature of w15oct28 is also the presence of different secretion systems including a full set of genes for type iv secretion, and several genes for type vi secretion and their vgrg effectors.

TI  == production of silver nanoparticles with strong and stable antimicrobial activity  against highly pathogenic and multidrug resistant bacteria.
AB  == aims: to synthesize, characterize, and analyze antimicrobial activity of agnps of escherichia hermannii (she), citrobacter sedlakii (s11p), and pseudomonas putida  (s5). methods: the synthesized agnps were examined using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (uv-vis) and, zeta potential, and the size and the morphology obtained from the three different isolates were also confirmed by tem. results: among the three isolates tested, she showed the best antimicrobial activity due to the presence of small (4-12 nm) and stable (-22 mv) agnps. stability of agnps  was also investigated and found to be dependent on the nature of isolates. conclusion: produced agnps showed particle stability and antimicrobial efficacy up to 90 days of production. our agnps exhibited greater antimicrobial activity compared with gentamicin against p. aeruginosa isolates and vancomycin against s. aureus and mrsa isolates at very low concentration (0.0002 mg per microliters).

TI  == wound healing potential of antibacterial microneedles loaded with green tea extracts.
AB  == this study evaluates the utility of an antibacterial microneedle composed of green tea (gt) extract and hyaluronic acid (ha), for the efficient delivery of gt. these microneedles have the potential to be a patient-friendly method for the conventional sustained release of drugs. in this study, a fabrication method using a mold-based technique to produce gt/ha microneedles with a maximum area of ~50mm(2) with antibacterial properties was used to manufacture transdermal drug delivery systems. fourier transform infrared (ftir) spectrometry was carried out  to observe the potential modifications in the microneedles, when incorporated with gt. the degradation rate of gt in gt/ha microneedles was controlled simply by adjusting the ha composition. the effects of different ratios of gt in the ha  microneedles were determined by measuring the release properties. in ha microneedles loaded with 70% gt (gt70), a continuous higher release rate was sustained for 72h. the in vitro cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that gt/ha microneedles were not generally cytotoxic to chinese hamster ovary cells (cho-k1), human embryonic kidney cells (293t), and mouse muscle cells (c2c12), which were treated for 12 and 24h. antimicrobial activity of the gt/ha microneedles was demonstrated by ~95% growth reduction of gram negative [escherichia coli (e. coli), pseudomonas putida (p. putida), and salmonella typhimurium (s. typhimurium)] and gram positive bacteria [staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and bacillus subtilis (b. subtilis)], with gt70. furthermore, gt/ha microneedles reduced bacterial growth of infected wound sites in the skin and improved wound healing process of skin in rat model.

TI  == cell system engineering to produce extracellular polyhydroxyalkanoate depolymerase with targeted applications.
AB  == novel platforms based on the application of bacterial cell systems as factories for production of new bioproducts open avenues and dramatically expand the catalogue of existing biomaterials. herein, we designed the strategy based on in  vivo production of extracellular pseudomonas fluorescens gk13 (phazgk13) depolymerase to degrade previously biosynthesized polyhydroxyalkanotes (phas) or  to obtain 3-hydroxyalkanoic acids (has). with this aim, extracellular phazgk13 was produced in recombinant strains and the optimal conditions for controlled release of has and oligomers by growing cells were set up with a particle suspension of (14)c-labelled pha, being maximal after 24h of incubation. genetic  modification of key factors involved in fatty acids metabolism revealed the influence of an active beta-oxidation pathway on the extracellular degradation of pha and subsequent has isolation. the highest has production was obtained using pseudomonas putida kt2442 fadb mutant (0.27mg/ml) due to the reduced ability of this strain to metabolize the degradation products. the system was applied to produce new added value has harboring thioester groups in the side chain from the functionalized mcl-pha, phacos. remarkably, hydrolyzed phacos showed greater potential to inhibit staphylococcus aureus(t) growth when compared to that of degradation products of non functionalized polyhydroxyoctanoate-co-hexanoate p(ho-co-hh).

TI  == survey of antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from bottlenose dolphins tursiops truncatus in the southeastern usa.
AB  == contamination of coastal waters can carry pathogens and contaminants that cause diseases in humans and wildlife, and these pathogens can be transported by water  to areas where they are not indigenous. marine mammals may be indicators of potential health effects from such pathogens and toxins. here we isolated bacterial species of relevance to humans from wild bottlenose dolphins tursiops truncatus and assayed isolated bacteria for antibiotic resistance. samples were collected during capture-release dolphin health assessments at multiple coastal and estuarine sites along the us mid-atlantic coast and the gulf of mexico. these samples were transported on ice and evaluated using commercial systems and aerobic culture techniques routinely employed in clinical laboratories. the most  common bacteria identified were species belonging to the genus vibrio, although escherichia coli, shewanella putrefaciens, and pseudomonas fluorescens/putida were also common. some of the bacterial species identified have been associated with human illness, including a strain of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) identified in 1 sample. widespread antibiotic resistance was observed among all sites, although the percentage of resistant isolates varied across sites and across time. these data provide a baseline for future comparisons of the bacteria that colonize bottlenose dolphins in the southeastern usa.

TI  == spalf4: a newly identified anti-lipopolysaccharide factor from the mud crab scylla paramamosain with broad spectrum antimicrobial activity.
AB  == anti-lipopolysaccharide factors (alfs) are antimicrobial peptides with binding and neutralizing activities to lipopolysaccharide (lps) in crustaceans. this study identified and characterized a novel alf homolog (spalf4) from the mud crab scylla paramamosain. the complete cdna of spalf4 had 756 bp with a 381 bp open reading frame encoding a protein with 126 aa. the deduced protein contained a signal peptide and a lps-binding domain. spalf4 shared the highest identity with  ptalf5 at amino acid level but exhibited low similarity with most of other crustacean alfs. furthermore, different from the previously identified three spalf homologs and most of other alfs, spalf4 had a low isoelectric point (pi) for the mature peptide and the lps-binding domain with the values of 6.93 and 6.74, respectively. these results indicate that spalf4 may be a unique alf homolog with special biological function in the mud crab. similar to the spatial  structure of alfpm3, spalf4 contains three alpha-helices packed against a four-strand beta-sheet, and an amphipathic loop formed by a disulphide bond between two conserved cysteine residues in lps-binding domain. spalf4, mainly distributed in hemocytes, could be upregulated by vibrio harveyi, staphylococcus  aureus, or white spot syndrome virus. recombinant spalf4 could inhibit the growth of gram-negative bacteria (v. harveyi, vibrio anguillarum, vibrio alginolyticus,  aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas putida), gram-positive bacteria (s. aureus and  bacillus megaterium), and a fungus candida albicans to varying degrees. further study showed that it could also bind to all the aforementioned microorganisms except s. aureus. these results demonstrate that spalf4 is a unique alf homolog with potent antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi. this characteristic suggests spalf4 plays an essential function in immune defense against pathogen invasion in mud crab.

TI  == photocatalytic bacterial inactivation by tio2-coated surfaces.
AB  == the aim of this study was the evaluation of the photoactivated antibacterial activity of titanium dioxide (tio2)-coated surfaces. bacterial inactivation was evaluated using tio2-coated petri dishes. the experimental conditions optimized with petri dishes were used to test the antibacterial effect of tio2-coated ceramic tiles. the best antibacterial effect with petri dishes was observed at 180, 60, 30 and 20 min of exposure for escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas putida and listeria innocua, respectively. the ceramic tiles demonstrated a photoactivated bactericidal effect at the same exposure time. in general, no differences were observed between the antibacterial effect obtained with petri dishes and tiles. however, the photochemical activity of petri dishes  was greater than the activity of the tiles.results obtained indicates that the tio2-coated surfaces showed a photoactivated bactericidal effect with all bacteria tested highlighting that the titania could be used in the ceramic and building industry for the production of coated surfaces to be placed in microbiologically sensitive environments, such as the hospital and food industry.

TI  == particle-cell contact enhances antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticles.
AB  == background: it is generally accepted that antibacterial properties of ag nanoparticles (agnps) are dictated by their dissolved fraction. however, dissolution-based concept alone does not fully explain the toxic potency of nanoparticulate silver compared to silver ions. methodology/principal findings: herein, we demonstrated that the direct contact between bacterial cell and agnps' surface enhanced the toxicity of nanosilver. more specifically, cell-np contact increased the cellular uptake of particle-associated ag ions - the single and ultimate cause of toxicity. to prove that, we evaluated the toxicity of three different agnps (uncoated, pvp-coated and protein-coated) to six bacterial strains: gram-negative escherichia coli, pseudomonas fluorescens, p. putida and p. aeruginosa and gram-positive bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus. while the toxicity of agno3 to these bacteria varied only slightly (the 4-h ec50  ranged from 0.3 to 1.2 mg ag/l), the 4-h ec50 values of protein-coated agnps for  various bacterial strains differed remarkably, from 0.35 to 46 mg ag/l. by systematically comparing the intracellular and extracellular free ag(+) liberated from agnps, we demonstrated that not only extracellular dissolution in the bacterial test environment but also additional dissolution taking place at the particle-cell interface played an essential role in antibacterial action of agnps. the role of the np-cell contact in dictating the antibacterial activity of ag-nps was additionally proven by the following observations: (i) separation of bacterial cells from agnps by particle-impermeable membrane (cut-off 20 kda, approximately 4 nm) significantly reduced the toxicity of agnps and (ii) p. aeruginosa cells which tended to attach onto agnps, exhibited the highest sensitivity to all forms of nanoparticulate ag. conclusions/significance: our findings provide new insights into the mode of antibacterial action of nanosilver and explain some discrepancies in this field, showing that "ag-ion" and "particle-specific" mechanisms are not controversial but, rather, are two faces of the same coin.

TI  == ecotoxicity and biodegradability of antielectrostatic dicephalic cationic surfactants.
AB  == four series of dicephalic cationic surfactants, considered as new antielectrostatic agents have been investigated in order to establish their toxicity and biodegradability. among them n,n-bis[3,3'-(dimethylamine)propyl]alkylamides, n,n-bis[3,3'-(dimethylamine)propyl]alkylamide dihydrochlorides, n,n-bis[3,3'-(trimethylammonio)propyl]alkylamide dibromides and n,n-bis[3,3'-(trimethylammonio)propyl]alkylamide dimethylsulphates with different hydrophobic chain length (n-c(9)h(19) to n-c(15)h(31)) and type of counterion (chloride, bromide and methylsulfate) have been studied. the inhibitory effect against microorganisms has been examined using model gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, and yeasts. none of the tested surfactants have shown antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida) and yeasts (saccharomyces cerevisiae, rhodotorula glutinis) at a concentration below 1000 mug ml(-1), however some of them were moderately active against gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis). the microtox(r) test was successfully applied to measure ec(50) values of the studied dicephalic cationic surfactants. their toxicity to vibrio fischeri depended upon the alkanoyl chain length with the ec(50) values in a range of 2.6-980 mg l(-1). n,n-bis[3,3'-(dimethylamine)propyl]alkylamide dihydrochlorides  2a-b and n,n-bis[3,3'-(trimethylammonio)propyl]alkylamide dibromides 3a-b comprising n-decanoyl and n-dodecanoyl hydrophobic tails appeared to be the least toxic. furthermore, the biodegradability under aerobic conditions of 2a-b, 3a-b was evaluated using oecd method 301f. according to the obtained results 2a, 3a-3b can be considered as almost readily biodegradable and they are not expected to be persistent in the environment. additionally, partial biodegradation was observed  for 2b, indicating its possible biodegradation in wastewater treatment systems.

TI  == kinetic, crystallographic, and mechanistic characterization of tomn: elucidation  of a function for a 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase homologue in the tomaymycin biosynthetic pathway.
AB  == the biosynthesis of the c ring of the antitumor antibiotic agent, tomaymycin, is  proposed to proceed through five enzyme-catalyzed steps from l-tyrosine. the genes encoding these enzymes have recently been cloned and their functions tentatively assigned, but there is limited biochemical evidence supporting the assignments of the last three steps. one enzyme, tomn, shows 58% pairwise sequence similarity with 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4-ot), an enzyme found in  a catabolic pathway for aromatic hydrocarbons. the tomn sequence includes three amino acids (pro-1, arg-11, and arg-39) that have been identified as critical catalytic residues in 4-ot. however, the proposed substrate for tomn is very different from that processed by 4-ot. to establish the function and mechanism of tomn and its relationship with 4-ot, we conducted kinetic, mutagenic, and structural studies. the kinetic parameters for tomn, and four alanine mutants, p1a, r11a, r39a, and r61a, were determined using 2-hydroxymuconate, the substrate for 4-ot. the tomn-catalyzed reaction using this substrate compares favorably to  that of 4-ot. in addition, the kinetic parameters for the p1a, r11a, and r39a mutants of tomn parallel the trends observed for the corresponding 4-ot mutants,  implicating an analogous mechanism. a high-resolution crystal structure (1.4 a) of tomn shows that the overall structure and the active site region are highly similar to those of 4-ot with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.81 a. moreover, key active site residues are positionally conserved. the combined results suggest that the tentative assignment for tomn and the proposed sequence of events in the biosynthetic pathway leading to the formation of the c ring of tomaymycin might not be correct. an alternative pathway that awaits biochemical confirmation is proposed.

TI  == linear alkylbenzene sulfonate tolerance in bacteria isolated from sediment of tropical water bodies polluted with detergents.
AB  == the discharge of untreated detergent-bearing waste introduces linear alklcylbenzene sulfonates (las) to the aquatic environment. the surfactant persists in some streams and rivers in nigeria, some is adsorbed to suspended materials and end in the sediment of the receiving water bodies. in this study, bacteria isolated from sediments of some tropical detergent-effluent-polluted streams were tested for tolerance to las using the media dilution technique. las-tolerance was indicated by growth of the bacteria in the presence of the surfactant. the ph, concentrations of surfactant, population of heterotrophic bacteria and population of las-tolerant bacteria in the sediments were determined. a direct relationship (r = 0.9124) was found between the alkaline conditions (ph= 8.2-12.0) and high surfactant concentrations (45-132 mg/g) in the sediment. the sediments harboured a high population and a wide variety of bacteria; the populations of viable heterotrophic bacteria (vhb: 2.9 x 10(5) to 1.2 x 10(7) cfu/g) and las tolerant bacteria (ltb: 1.5 x 10(4) to 1.2 x 10(6) cfu/g) had a direct relationship (r = 0.9500). an inverse relationship resulted between each of them and the concentration of surfactant in the sediment, r(vhb/las) = -0.9303 and r(ltb/las) = -0.9143, respectively. twelve bacteria species were isolated from the sediment: alcaligenes odorans, bacillus subtilis,  burkholderia cepacia, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter diversus, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, micrococcus albus, pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas stutzeri, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcusfaecalis. most of them were adapted to the surfactant with their maximum acceptable concentrations ranging between 0.03 and >1.0% (w/v). the sediments could serve as source of adapted organisms which can be used in bio-treatment of las-bearing waste.

TI  == tunable antimicrobial polypropylene surfaces: simultaneous attachment of penicillin (gram +) and gentamicin (gram -).
AB  == surface reactions were performed on polypropylene (pp) surfaces to retard the simultaneous growth of staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and pseudomonas putida (p. putida) bacteria. microwave plasma reactions in the presence of maleic anhydride (ma) resulted in the formation of acid groups on the surface of pp. such surfaces were further modified by conducting two parallel reactions: (1) poly(ethylene glycol) (peg) was attached to cooh groups of the pp surface, followed by penicillin v (pen) reactions to target s. aureus destruction and (2)  diglycidyl peg was attached, followed by gentamicin (gen) reactions, to create antimicrobial surfaces targeted at p. putida . simultaneous gram "+" and gram "-" resistance was obtained by varying the pen/gen ratios on such modified pp surfaces, thus providing the controllable degree of gram "+" and gram "-" antimicrobial strength. while spectroscopic analyses revealed chemical attachments of pen and gen, the effectiveness against proliferation of s. aureus  (gram +) and p. putida (gram -) bacteria was determined using liquid culture tests. these studies show for the first time the formation of tunable antimicrobial polypropylene surfaces with controllable strength.

TI  == security swipe cards and scanners are a potential reservoir for hospital-acquired infection.
AB  == introduction: hospital-acquired infections complicate 10% of hospital admissions  resulting in increased morbidity, mortality and cost to hospitals. most hospitals issue doctors with plastic swipe cards that function as electronic keys to access clinical areas. the card is handled many times a day, often before direct patient contact. the aim of this study was to determine if swipe cards harbour potentially harmful bacteria. subjects and methods: on a single day, doctors working in the surgical directorate completed a questionnaire to determine their  pattern of swipe card use. cards were inoculated onto agar plates and incubated for 48 h under standard laboratory conditions, following which the number of colony forming units (cfus) cultured from each card was determined. representative colonies were sampled and sub-cultured for staphlococcal, enterococcal, coliform and pseudomonad species. isolated bacterial pathogens were tested for antimicrobial sensitivity. swipe-card scanners were swabbed for microbiological culture on the same day. results: all cards were colonised with environmental bacteria (mean, 73 cfu). of cards, 21% were contaminated with pathogenic bacteria including staphylococcus aureus (5.1%), pseudomonas putida (2.6%), and coliform species (12.8%). the pattern of card use did not significantly affect the amount of bacterial contamination, but infrequent use of the card and keeping the card in a pocket or wallet was associated with higher levels of contamination. environmental bacteria were cultured from 88% of card scanners, the highest counts coming from scanners in main theatres and the day-surgery unit. conclusions: doctors' swipe cards are contaminated with, and may therefore be a reservoir for, pathogenic bacteria implicated in hospital-acquired infection.

TI  == beta-lactams as selective chemical probes for the in vivo labeling of bacterial enzymes involved in cell wall biosynthesis, antibiotic resistance, and virulence.
AB  == with the development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains, infectious diseases have become again a life-threatening problem. one of the reasons for this dilemma is the limited number and breadth of current therapeutic targets for which several resistance strategies have evolved over time. to expand the number  of addressable enzyme targets and to understand their function, activity, and regulation, we utilized a chemical proteomic strategy, called activity-based protein profiling (abpp) pioneered by cravatt, for the identification of beta-lactam-binding enzymes under in vivo conditions. in this two-tiered strategy, we first prepared a selection of conventional antibiotics for labeling  diverse penicillin binding proteins (pbps) and second introduced a new synthetic  generation of beta-lactam probes, which labeled and inhibited a selection of additional pbp unrelated bacterial targets. among these, the virulence-associated enzyme clpp and a resistance-associated beta-lactamase were labeled and inhibited by selected probes, indicating that the specificity of beta-lactams can be adjusted to versatile enzyme families with important cellular functions.

TI  == attachment of ampicillin to expanded poly(tetrafluoroethylene): surface reactions leading to inhibition of microbial growth.
AB  == the broad spectrum antibiotic, ampicillin (am), was reacted to expanded poly (tetrafluoroethylene) (eptfe) surfaces and resulted in the formation of antimicrobial surfaces effective against gram-positive, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus thuringiensis, and enterococcus faecalis, and gram-negative, escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, and salmonella enterica bacteria. these eptfe surface modifications were accomplished by utilization of microwave maleic anhydride (ma) plasma reactions leading to the formation of acid groups, followed by amidation reactions of heterofunctional nh 2/cooh-terminated polyethylene glycol (peg). the final step, the attachment of am to the peg spacer, was achieved by amidation reactions between cooh-terminated peg and nh 2 groups of am. this approach protects the cooh-am functionality and diminishes the possibility of hydrolysis of the antimicrobial active portion of am. these studies also show that approximately 90% of am molecules are still covalently attached to peg-ma-eptfe surfaces after exposure to the bacteria solutions. even after a 24 h period, the  am volume concentration changes only from 2.25 to 2.04 microg/m3, and depending upon the bacteria type, the bacteria suspensions containing am-peg-ma-eptfe specimens retain 85-99% of their initial optical density.

TI  == [study of ectoparasitism of ultramicrobacteria of the genus kaistia, strains nf1  and nf3 by electron and fluorescence microscopy].
AB  == transmission electron and fluorescence microscopy was used to study the character of the interaction of free-living ultramicrobacterial (umb) strains nf1 and nf3,  affiliated with the genus kaistia, and seven species of gram-positive and gram-negative heterotrophic bacteria. strains nf1 and nf3 were found to exhibit parasitic activity against gram-positive bacillus subtilis and gram-negative acidovorax delafildii. umb cells are tightly attached to the envelopes of the victim cells and induce their lysis, thus demonstrating the features of typical ectoparasitism. the selectivity of parasitism of the studied umb to the victim bacteria has been shown: only two soil microorganisms of the seven test objects,  b. subtilis atcc 6633 and an aerobic gram-negative bacterium a. delafildii 39, were found to be sensitive to umb attack. other bacteria (micrococcus luteus vkm  ac-2230, staphylococcus aureus 209-p, pseudomonas putida bs394, escherichia coli  c 600, and pantoea agglomerans atcc 27155) were not attacked by umb. it was established for the first time that free-living umb may be facultative parasites  not only of phototrophic bacteria, as we have previously demonstrated, but of heterotrophic bacteria as well. the umb under study seem to play an important role in the regulation of the quantity of microorganisms and in the functioning of microbial communities in some natural ecotopes.

AB  == aims: to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of flavonoid-rich fractions derived from bergamot peel, a byproduct from the citrus fruit processing industry and the influence of enzymatic deglycosylation on their activity against different bacteria and yeast. methods and results: bergamot ethanolic fractions were tested against gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, salmonella enterica), gram-positive bacteria (listeria innocua, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, lactococcus lactis) and the yeast saccharomyces  cerevisiae. bergamot fractions were found to be active against all the gram-negative bacteria tested, and their antimicrobial potency increased after enzymatic deglycosylation. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of the fractions and the pure flavonoids, neohesperidin, hesperetin (aglycone), neoeriocitrin, eriodictyol (aglycone), naringin and naringenin (aglycone), were found to be in the range 200 to 800 microg ml(-1). the interactions between three bergamot flavonoids were also evaluated. conclusion: the enzyme preparation pectinase 62l  efficiently converted common glycosides into their aglycones from bergamot extracts, and this deglycosylation increased the antimicrobial potency of citrus  flavonoids. pairwise combinations of eriodictyol, naringenin and hesperetin showed both synergistic and indifferent interactions that were dependent on the test indicator organism. significance and impact of the study: bergamot peel is a potential source of natural antimicrobials that are active against gram-negative  bacteria.

TI  == antibacterial activity of guava (psidium guajava l.) and neem (azadirachta indica a. juss.) extracts against foodborne pathogens and spoilage bacteria.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of guava (psidium guajava) and neem (azadirachta indica) extracts against 21 strains of foodborne pathogens were determined--listeria monocytogenes (five strains), staphylococcus aureus (four strains), escherichia coli o157:h7 (six strains), salmonella enteritidis (four strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus, and bacillus cereus, and five food spoilage bacteria: pseudomonas aeroginosa, p. putida, alcaligenes faecalis, and aeromonas  hydrophila (two strains). guava and neem extracts showed higher antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria compared to gram-negative bacteria except for v. parahaemolyticus, p. aeroginosa, and a. hydrophila. none of the extracts showed antimicrobial activity against e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella enteritidis. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of ethanol extracts of guava showed the highest inhibition for l. monocytogenes jcm 7676 (0.1 mg/ml), s. aureus jcm 2151 (0.1 mg/ml), s. aureus jcm 2179 (0.1 mg/ml), and v. parahaemolyticus ifo 12711 (0.1 mg/ml) and the lowest inhibition for alcaligenes faecalis ifo 12669, aeromonas hydrophila nfri 8282 (4.0 mg/ml), and a. hydrophila nfri 8283 (4.0 mg/ml). the mic of chloroform extracts of neem showed similar inhibition for l. monocytogenes atcc 43256 (4.0 mg/ml) and l. monocytogenes atcc 49594 (5.0 mg/ml). however, ethanol extracts of neem showed higher inhibition for s. aureus jcm 2151 (4.5 mg/ml) and s. aureus ifo 13276 (4.5 mg/ml) and the lower inhibition for other microorganisms (6.5 mg/ml). no significant effects of temperature and ph were found on guava and neem extracts against cocktails of l. monocytogenes and s. aureus. the results of the present study suggest that guava and neem extracts  possess compounds containing antibacterial properties that can potentially be useful to control foodborne pathogens and spoilage organisms.

TI  == bloodstream infections after median sternotomy at a children's hospital.
AB  == objectives: postoperative bloodstream infections are a major source of morbidity  and increased health care costs. in adults, mediastinitis has been described as a risk factor for bloodstream infections. the objectives of this retrospective cohort study were to determine the incidence and to identify risk factors for postoperative bloodstream infections among children after median sternotomy in an urban tertiary care children's hospital. methods: for this study, 192 patients were randomly selected from among all patients undergoing median sternotomy between january 1, 1995, and december 31, 2003. results: ninety-eight (51%) of the 192 eligible patients were male. the median patient age was 5.4 months (interquartile range: 1 day-41.5 years). bloodstream infections occurred in 12 (6.3%; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 3.3%-10.7%) patients within the first 30 days after median sternotomy. bloodstream infections developed a median of 11 days (range: 3-29 days) after median sternotomy. gram-negative bacilli caused 6 (50%) of the 12 bloodstream infections. specific causes of bloodstream infections included pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 3), pseudomonas fluorescens-putida (n = 2), staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), serratia marcescens (n = 1), and candida albicans (n = 1). multivariable analysis revealed that the development of mediastinitis (odds ratio [or], 28.16; 95% ci, 3.37-235.22) and the requirement for postoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (or, 12.52; 95% ci, 2.99-52.41) were associated with bloodstream infections after median sternotomy. conclusions: postoperative bloodstream infections occurred in 6.3% of children undergoing median sternotomy. postoperative mediastinitis and the requirement for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were risk factors for bloodstream infections after median sternotomy. these findings warrant exploration in a larger, multicenter study.

TI  == microbiological study of cosmetic products during their use by consumers: health  risk and efficacy of preservative systems.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the microbial contamination of 91 cosmetics (23 o/w emulsions, 47 tensiolytes, 21 aqueous pastes) in three different states of use (intact, in-use, ending product) and the protection efficacy of the preservative systems most frequently used in the analysed cosmetic formulations. methods and results:  total bacterial count, isolation and identification of pathogenic isolates were performed on the collected cosmetics. about 10.6% of tensiolytes (13.5% bath foam, 6.7% shampoo, 10% liquid soaps) were contaminated by staphylococcus warneri, staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas putida. the efficacy of the preservative systems of two cosmetic products, tested against standard micro-organisms (staphylococcus aureus atcc 4338 and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc  9027) and two isolates from cosmetics in this study (s. epidermidis and p. putida), satisfied the cosmetics, toiletries, and fragrance association and official italian pharmacopeia criteria, while only one tested cosmetic respected  the rapid challenge test criterion. conclusions: contaminated cosmetic products are relatively uncommon, but some products, unable to suppress the growth of several micro-organisms, represent a potential health hazard. significance and impact of the study: the challenge test may be performed not only during the preparation of the preservative system in the intact cosmetics, but also be used  to evaluate the protection efficacy during their use.

TI  == bacterial species specificity in prou osmoinducibility and nptii and lacz expression.
AB  == reporter gene-based transcriptional fusions are increasingly being used to address questions in microbial ecology, with constitutively expressed fusions enabling microbe tracking and inducible fusions reporting the presence of environmental signals. to more readily apply this technology to a variety of bacterial species, we examined species specificity in the expression of three promoters of interest. a comparison of two potentially constitutive promoters, each fused to the reporter gene gfp, showed that the nptii promoter (p(nptii)) was expressed in a broader range of species (100% of 11 tested) than the lacz promoter (p(lacz)) (75% of 11 tested), and thus has broader applicability for marking bacteria than p(lacz). for the species that expressed p(lacz), however,p(lacz) was expressed 3-fold more than p(nptii), on average. the escherichia coli prou promoter, which is induced by low water potential in e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, pantoea agglomerans, and pseudomonas syringae, was  shown to be similarly responsive to water potential in strains of clavibacter michiganensis, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, and sinorhizobium meliloti, as well as mildly osmoresponsive in agrobacterium tumefaciens, supporting its broad use as a reporter of water potential. surprisingly, this promoter was not regulated by water potential in strains of staphylococcus aureus and erwinia amylovora, illustrating heretofore unrecognized species specificity in prou inducibility, as well as potential limitations in the species that can serve as bioreporters of water potential.

AB  == immobilization of living cells of lactic acid bacteria could be an alternative or complementary method of immobilizing organic acids and bacteriocins and inhibit undesirable bacteria in foods. this study evaluated the inhibition potential of immobilized lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis atcc 11454 on selected bacteria by a modified method of the agar spot test. l. lactis was immobilized in calcium alginate (1 to 2%)-whey protein concentrate (0 and 1%) beads. the antimicrobial potential of immobilized l. lactis was evaluated in microbiological media against pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, salmonella, and staphylococcus aureus) or  pseudomonas putida, a natural meat contaminant, and against seven gram-positive bacteria used as indicator strains. results obtained in this study indicated that immobilized l. lactis inhibited the growth of s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus sakei, kocuria varians, and pediococcus acidilactici. only 4 h of incubation at 35 degrees c resulted in a clear inhibition zone around the beads that increased with time. with the addition of 10 mm of a chelating agent (edta) to the media, results showed growth inhibition of e. coli; however, p. putida and salmonella typhi were unaffected by this treatment. these results indicate that immobilized lactic acid bacteria strains can be successfully used to produce nisin and inhibit bacterial  growth in semisolid synthetic media.

TI  == interactions between high pressure homogenization and antimicrobial activity of lysozyme and lactoperoxidase.
AB  == it was the objective of this work to evaluate the effect of high pressure homogenization on the activity of antimicrobial enzymes such as lysozyme and lactoperoxidase against a selected group of gram positive and gram negative species inoculated in skim milk. lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus plantarum and listeria monocytogenes were the most pressure resistant species while bacillus subtilis, pseudomonas putida, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris and salmonella enteritidis were found to  be very sensitive to the hyperbaric treatment. the enzyme addition enhanced the instantaneous pressure efficacy on almost all the considered species as indicated by their instantaneous viability loss following the treatment. moreover, the combination of the enzyme and high pressure homogenization significantly affected the recovery and growth dynamics of several of the considered species. although l. monocytogenes was slightly sensitive to pressure, the combination of the two stress factors induced a significant viability loss within 3 h and an extension of lag phases in skim milk during incubation at 37 degrees c. the hypothesis formulated in this work is that the interaction of high pressure homogenization and lysozyme or lactoperoxidase is associated to conformational modifications of  the two proteins with a consequent enhancement of their activity. this hypothesis is supported by the experimental results also regarding the increased antimicrobial activity against l. plantarum of the previously pressurised lysozyme with respect to that of the native enzyme.

AB  == the 52 amino acid host killing peptide (hok) from the hok/sok post-segregational  killer system of the escherichia coli plasmid r1 was synthesized using fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) chemistry, and its molecular weight was confirmed by mass spectroscopy. hok kills cells by depolarizing the cytoplasmic membrane when  it is made in the cytosol. six microorganisms, e. coli, bacillus subtilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. putida, salmonella typhimurium, and staphylococcus aureus were exposed to the purified peptide but showed no significant killing. however, electroporation of hok (200 microgml(-1)) into e. coli cells showed a dramatic reduction (100000-fold) in the number of cells transformed with plasmid  dna which indicates that the synthetic hok peptide killed cells. electroporation  of hok into p. putida was also very effective with a 500-fold reduction in electrocompetent cells (100 microgml(-1)). heat shock in the presence of hok (380 microgml(-1)) resulted in a 5-fold reduction in e. coli cells but had no effect on b. subtilis. in addition, three hok fragments (hok(1-28), hok(31-52) and hok(16-52)) killed cells when electroporated into e. coli at 200 microgml(-1) (over 1000-fold killing for hok(1-28), 50-fold killing for hok(16-52) and over 1000-fold killing for hok(31-52)). e. coli cells electroporated with hok and visualized using transmission electron microscopy showed the same morphological changes as control cells to which hok was induced using a plasmid inside the cell.

TI  == reduction of cell lysate viscosity during processing of poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates) by chromosomal integration of the staphylococcal nuclease gene in pseudomonas putida.
AB  == poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates) (phas) are biodegradable thermoplastics which are accumulated by many bacterial species in the form of intracellular granules and which are thought to serve as reserves of carbon and energy. pseudomonas putida accumulates a polyester, composed of medium-side-chain 3-hydroxyalkanoic acids, which has excellent film-forming properties. industrial processing of pha involves purification of the pha granules from high-cell-density cultures. after  the fermentation process, cells are lysed by homogenization and pha granules are  purified by chemical treatment and repeated washings to yield a pha latex. unfortunately, the liberation of chromosomal dna during lysis causes a dramatic increase in viscosity, which is problematic in the subsequent purification steps. reduction of the viscosity is generally achieved by the supplementation of commercially available nuclease preparations or by heat treatment; however, both  procedures add substantial costs to the process. as a solution to this problem, a nuclease-encoding gene from staphylococcus aureus was integrated into the genomes of several pha producers. staphylococcal nuclease is readily expressed in pha-producing pseudomonas strains and is directed to the periplasm, and occasionally to the culture medium, without affecting pha production or strain stability. during downstream processing, the viscosity of the lysate from a nuclease-integrated pseudomonas strain was reduced to a level similar to that observed for the wild-type strain after treatment with commercial nuclease. the nuclease gene was also functionally integrated into the chromosomes of other pha  producers, including ralstonia eutropha.

AB  == two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of proteins from escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, and staphylococcus aureus, grown with methionine or one of a  variety of organosulfates and organosulfonates as the sole source of sulfur, showed expression of specific sets of 7 to 14 proteins which were not observed during growth with sulfate or cysteine for all three species or with thiocyanate  for p. putida and s. aureus. under the same conditions, arylsulfatase activity in p. putida and s. aureus was seen to increase by up to 140-fold, suggesting that the proteins induced under these conditions may be involved in sulfur metabolism. we propose that these proteins are members of a sulfate starvation-induced stimulon.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of cefpiramide to fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == in the subjects of 835 strains of 37 clinically isolated microbial strains, which were separated and identified among materials collected from patients with various infections and which were sent from medical therapeutic institutions throughout japan in 1990, for the purpose of examining the antimicrobial activity of cefpiramide (cpm), its minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), together with those of other cephem antibiotics, was determined, and the following conclusions  were obtained. 1. microbial strains in which no cpm-resistant strains emerged were streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and anaerobic gram-positive cocci. 2. in comparison with reports by many researchers at the former half of the 1980s, microbial stains suggesting an increase in resistance to cpm were staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and haemophilus influenzae, but also in other microbial strains the resistance to cpm was observed in high ratios. 3. among strains used in the test, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, cephamycin and oxime type cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacilli of enterobacteriaceae, and new quinolone-resistant microbes were observed in high ratios; therefore, it was considered that cpm could not exert sufficient  antimicrobial activities to these strains because of many resistant strains being complicated among these "cpm-resistant strains". 4. it was discussed that "the resistance mechanism observed throughout beta-lactam drugs as a while and the study themes in the dimension including social circumstances where resistant strains emerged", as pointed out by the authors in 1989, increased the significance of these days in the evaluation of timecourse changes in microbes resistant to specific drugs including cpm. 5. there are many unfavorable conditions in the antimicrobial activities of cpm to clinically isolated strains  in recent years. however, it was jointly confirmed that cpm maintained effective  antimicrobial activities to the majority of clinically isolated strains. furthermore, when it was additionally considered that cpm was one of not many cephem drugs having persistent blood levels, a conclusion was drawn that cpm was  one of clincally useful cephem drugs even at present.

TI  == [clinical evaluation of cefpirome in children].
AB  == cefpirome (cpr, hr 810) was clinically evaluated for its efficacy and safety in 11 patients with ages from 4 months to 11 years with bacterial infection. the results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. cpr was administered to 6 patients with bronchopneumonia, a patient with pneumonia, a patient with tonsillitis, 2 patients with acute pharyngitis and a patient with suppurative parotitis at daily dosage levels ranging 55.5-91.7 mg/kg, divided into 3 using intravenous bolus injection or 30 minutes drip infusion. clinical responses of the 11 patients were as follows: excellent; 8 patients, good; 2 patients, poor; 1 patient, hence the efficacy rate was 90.9%. 2. neither clinical adverse reaction nor abnormal laboratory test value was observed except slight elevation of got and gpt in a patient and leukopenia in another. 3. mics of cpr against 18 beta-lactamase producing strains isolated from patients were as follows. mic against a strain of staphylococcus aureus was 1.56 micrograms/ml, mics against 3 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae were less than 0.025 microgram/ml, those against 3 out of 5 strains of enterobacter cloacae were less than 0.025 microgram/ml and those against the remaining 2 strains were 0.05 and 0.20 micrograms/ml. mics against 2  out of 3 strains acinetobacter lwoffi were 1.56 micrograms/ml, and that of the remaining 1 strain was 0.39 microgram/ml. mics against 2 strains of pseudomonas cepacia were 1.56 micrograms/ml. mics against a strain of pseudomonas putida and  a strain of citrobacter diversus were 0.78 and less than 0.025 microgram/ml, respectively.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == antimicrobial activity of microgard against food spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == microgard, a commercially available fermented milk product containing antimicrobial metabolites, was a potent inhibitor for gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas, salmonella, and yersinia when 1% concentration was incorporated into agar media. gram-positive bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, and listeria monocytogenes were insensitive to microgard. kluyveromyces marxianus, an unidentified black yeast, and penicillium expansum were partially suppressed, whereas aspergillus niger and a yogurt spoilage yeast were tolerant to 5% microgard. optimum activity of microgard was at ph 5.3 and below; the concentration that gave complete inhibition depended upon the number of bacteria  present as well as the genus tested. blood agar base reversed the antagonistic activity of microgard against pseudomonas putida compared with plate count agar.

TI  == [studies on respiratory infections in primary care clinic (iii). distribution of  bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in the tohoku district of japan].
AB  == the bacteriology of the isolates from the throat swab and the sputum respectively of 2,539 patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in tohoku district of japan during the period from january to april in 1989 was documented. of the 2,539 patients, 1,694 had an acute upper respiratory infection, 609 had acute bronchitis, 46 had acute pneumonia, 84 had acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory infections and 106 had respiratory infections without diagnosis registered. 1887 (74.3%) strains of potential pathogens were recovered from 1507 (59.4%) of the 2539 cases. the rate of recovery of potential  pathogens was very high in patients of the younger age. these patients had elevated body-temperature. there were statistically significant differences in recovery rate when classified by diagnosis, prefecture and the period of investigation. of the 1,887 strains, 996 (52.8%) were gram-positive and 891 (47.2%) were gram-negative bacteria. the rate of recovery of gram-negative bacteria was high in patients who were less than 10 years old and more than 51 years old, in patients with pneumonia and chronic respiratory infections, and in  patients with fever. of the 1,887 strains, those which exceeded 100 were staphylococcus aureus (481 strains), haemophilus influenzae (340 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (329 strains), streptococcus pyogenes (117 strains) and  acinetobacter spp. (100 strains). species other than those mentioned above had less than 100 strains. in this group there were 39 strains of branhamella catarrhalis, 32 strains of escherichia coli, 97 strains of klebsiella spp., 40 strains of enterobacter spp., 25 strains of serratia spp., 12 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 43 strains of pseudomonas putida. there was a remarkable difference in recovery rate of each species when classified by diagnosis, age class, prefecture and the period of investigation, respectively. the above results indicated that gram-positive bacteria are more frequent than gram-negative bacteria, that enterobacteriaceae and glucose-non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria are only rarely found in primary care clinics, and that the bacteriology in primary care clinic is different from that of medical school-affiliated hospitals.

TI  == use of a novel cassette to label phenotypically a cryptic plasmid of bacillus subtilis and map loci involved in its stable maintenance.
AB  == in order to facilitate studies on the maintenance of cryptic plasmids from gram-positive bacteria we have constructed a novel cassette capg1000 (5.0 kb) which carries both a selectable marker (chloramphenicol resistance from staphylococcus aureus plasmid pc194) and a screenable marker (the xyle gene from  the tol plasmid of pseudomonas putida expressed from a cloned promoter of bacillus phage spo2) and which is flanked by terminators to prevent transcription from the cassette activating or inhibiting loci adjacent to the site of insertion. to demonstrate the usefulness of this cassette we have mapped loci required for stable maintenance of an 8.6 kb cryptic plasmid endogenous to bacillus subtilis (ppod2000) from the properties of capg1000 insertion and insertion/deletion derivatives. we have identified the replication region as well as separate regions required for segregational and structural stability. the segregational mechanism is very efficient since it allows no detectable loss despite the fact that bacteria carrying the plasmid have a greatly increased mean generation time.

TI  == ofloxacin versus vancomycin/polymyxin for prevention of infections in granulocytopenic patients.
AB  == introduction: the efficacy and safety of oral ofloxacin were compared with those  of vancomycin/polymyxin for prophylaxis of bacterial infections in granulocytopenic patients undergoing chemotherapy for hematologic malignancy. patients and methods: antimicrobial prophylaxis was begun at the time of initiation of chemotherapy. thirty patients received ofloxacin tablets (300 mg orally every 12 hours) plus a nystatin suspension. thirty-two patients received vancomycin capsules (500 mg orally every eight hours) and polymyxin capsules (100 mg orally every eight hours) plus a nystatin suspension. results: in the group of patients receiving ofloxacin, there were a lower number of acquired gram-negative bacillary organisms per patient (0.13 versus 1.37, p less than 0.00005), fewer patients with documented infection (11 of 30 versus 21 of 32, p = 0.04), and fewer cases of gram-negative septicemia (zero of 30 versus five of 32, p = 0.05). ofloxacin was also better tolerated (24 of 30 versus 10 of 32 patients highly compliant, p = 0.01) and associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects (one of 30 versus nine of 32 patients with gastrointestinal side effects, p = 0.01) than vancomycin/polymyxin. however, except for a reduction of staphylococcus aureus colonization and infection by ofloxacin, neither ofloxacin nor vancomycin/polymyxin was effective in eliminating colonization or infection with  viridans group streptococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, or other gram-positive organisms. only three isolates of ofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, and enterobacter aerogenes) were isolated from surveillance cultures, but none caused infection. conclusion: these results suggest that oral ofloxacin is a more tolerable and efficacious alternative to vancomycin/polymyxin for prevention of serious gram-negative bacillary infections in granulocytopenic patients. more effective prophylaxis of gram-positive infections, however, is still needed.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == in vivo enzymology: a deuterium nmr study of formaldehyde dismutase in pseudomonas putida f61a and staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == high-resolution deuterium nmr spectroscopy has been used to follow the detoxifying metabolism of [d2]formaldehyde in vivo in several bacterial species.  production of [d2]methanol in escherichia coli confirms that the oxidation and reduction pathways of metabolism are independent in this organism. efficient production of equimolar quantities of [d]formate and [d3]methanol in pseudomonas  putida f61a and staphylococcus aureus implicates a formaldehyde dismutase, or "cannizzarase", activity. these observations imply that the unusual formaldehyde  resistance in p. putida f61a is a direct result of efficient dismutation acting as a route for detoxification. cross-dismutation experiments yield an enzymic kinetic isotope effect of ca. 4 for h vs d transfer and a similar spectrum of substrate specificity to the isolated enzyme. [d]benzyl alcohol produced by cross-dismutation of [d2]formaldehyde and benzaldehyde in p. putida is demonstrated to have the r configuration by a novel deuterium nmr assay. additionally, s. aureus produces methyl formate as a product of formaldehyde detoxification, apparently by oxidizing the methanol hemiacetal of formaldehyde.

TI  == the complete amino acid sequence and identification of the active-site arginine peptide of escherichia coli 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase.
AB  == the complete amino acid sequence of 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase from escherichia coli has been established in the following manner. after being reduced with dithiothreitol, the purified aldolase was alkylated with iodoacetamide and subsequently digested with trypsin. the resulting 19 peptide peaks observed by high performance liquid chromatography, which compared with 21  expected tryptic cleavage products, were all isolated, purified, and individually sequenced. overlap peptides were obtained by a combination of sequencing the n-terminal region of the intact aldolase and by cleaving the intact enzyme with cyanogen bromide followed by subdigestion of the three major cyanogen bromide peptides with either staphylococcus aureus v8 endoproteinase, endoproteinase lys  c, or trypsin after citraconylation of lysine residues. the primary structure of  the molecule was determined to be as follows. (formula; see text) 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase from e. coli consists of 213 amino acids with  a subunit and a trimer molecular weight of 22,286 and 66,858, respectively. no microheterogeneity is observed among the three subunits. the peptide containing the active-site arginine residue (vlahos, c. j., ghalambor, m. a., and dekker, e. e. (1985) j. biol. chem. 260, 5480-5485) was also isolated and sequenced; this arginine residue occupies position 49. the schiff base-forming lysine residue (vlahos, c. j., and dekker, e. e. (1986) j. biol. chem. 261, 11049-11055) is located at position 133. whereas the active-site lysine peptide of this aldolase  shows 65% homology with the same peptide of 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase from pseudomonas putida, these two proteins in toto show 49% homology.

AB  == fosfomycin (fom) otic solution was administered to 587 patients with suppurative  otitis media infections including 190 patients in the dose-establishment test, 126 patients in the open clinical trial and 271 patients in the double blind test. various bacteria were detected in the 549 cases in which bacteriological investigation was possible. main bacteria detected from the above cases were s. aureus (261 strains, 47.5%), p. aeruginosa (93 strains, 16.9%), coagulase negative staphylococci (cns) (89 strains, 16.2%), providencia spp. (35 strains, 6.4%) and proteus spp. (28 strains, 5.1%). twenty-seven strains of anaerobic bacteria (4.9%) were also detected. the mic of fom, and the reference drug, chloramphenicol (cp), fradiomycin (frm), cefmenoxime (cmx) and cephalexin (cex),  were determined up to a concentration of 800 micrograms/ml with inoculum sizes of 10(6) and 10(8) cfu/ml. about 30% of s. aureus was multi-drug resistant, including methicillin and cephems, but fom showed excellent antibacterial activity against it. the fom had superior antibacterial activity against p. aeruginosa to cp, frm and cmx, and was also active against other bacteria. the antibacterial activity of fom was inferior to other drugs against cns, enterobacter spp., p. putida and p. cepacia. the detection rate of these bacteria, however, was low and since their role as causative organisms is not well defined, the inferior activity of fom has no effect on the bacteriological evaluation of fom. since the concentration in the tympanic cavity about 1 hour after the administration of 3% fom solution was estimated to be 2,000 to 3,000 micrograms/ml, it could be presumed that bacteria inhibited by 800 micrograms/ml  of fom at an inoculum size of 10(8) cfu/ml would be eradicable. the low ototoxicity of fom is likely due to its characteristic as an inhibitor of bacterial cell wall synthesis. from these results, 3% fom otic solution may be considered as a remarkably useful topical preparation for the treatment of suppurative otitis media.

TI  == minimum bacterial density for bacteriophage replication: implications for significance of bacteriophages in natural ecosystems.
AB  == bacteriophage 80 alpha did not increase in number in cultures containing less than about 1.0 x 10(4) to 1.5 x 10(4) cfu of staphylococcus aureus per ml, but bacteriophage replication did occur when the number of bacteria exceeded this density, either initially or as a result of host cell multiplication. the minimum density of an asporogenous strain of bacillus subtilis required for an increase in the number of bacteriophage sp beta ci was about 3 x 10(4) cfu/ml. the threshold density of escherichia coli for the multiplication of bacteriophage t4  was about 7 x 10(3) cfu/ml. in the presence of montmorillonite, bacteriophage t4  did not increase in number until the e. coli population exceeded 10(4) cfu/ml. the mineralization of glucose was not affected in e. coli cultures inoculated with a low number of bacteriophage t4, but it could not be detected in cultures inoculated with a large number of phage. the numbers of bacteriophage t4 and a bacteriophage that lyses pseudomonas putida declined rapidly after being added to lake water or sewage. we suggest that bacteriophages do not affect the number or  activity of bacteria in environments where the density of the host species is below the host cell threshold of about 10(4) cfu/ml.
