TI  == assessment of periodontal and opportunistic flora in patients with peri-implantitis.
AB  == aim: to assess the presence of periodontal and opportunistic organisms in patients with peri-implantitis. material and methods: thirty-three partially edentulous subjects (22 women, 11 men), aged 32-90 years, who had one or more implants with peri-implantitis were included. peri-implantitis was defined as: (i) the presence of bleeding on probing and/or suppuration and (ii) radiographic  images showed marginal bone loss >1.8 mm after 1 year in function. criteria for inclusion were: (i) partially edentulous patients having at least one implant diagnosed with peri-implantitis; (ii) no antibiotic therapy for 6 months prior to clinical examination. following this definition, a total of 48 implants were diagnosed with peri-implantitis. subgingival bacterial samples were obtained with sterile paper points from infected implants and selected teeth of each individual. periodontopathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) were detected by multiplex pcr targeting 16s rdna. samples were placed in reduced transport medium and cultured for opportunistic pathogens  (staphylococcus aureus, enteric bacteria, pseudomonas and yeasts). results: twenty-two patients yielded positive results for p. gingivalis, 25 for t. forsythia, eight for p. intermedia and 13 for t. denticola. none of the patients  yielded a positive result for a. actinomycetemcomitans. non-periodontal species were found in five patients (15% of total). p. aeruginosa was found in four (12%) patients, and c. albicans (3%) and s. aureus in one patient (3%) each. in two cases of peri-implantitis, none of the periodontal or opportunistic microorganisms studied were detected in either implant or tooth samples. when results of the periodontopathic bacteria from the implant and tooth samples of the same patient were compared, 18 patients (54%) showed the same results for both samples and 15 (45%) patients different results. conclusions: the implant surface may be colonized with pathogens different from periodontal bacteria. opportunistic pathogens such as p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and c. albicans may be associated with implant failure.

TI  == 16s rdna-based metagenomic analysis of dental plaque and lung bacteria in patients with severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  == background and objective: acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ae-copd) are leading causes of mortality in hospital intensive care units. we sought to determine whether dental plaque biofilms might harbor pathogenic bacteria that can eventually cause lung infections in patients with severe ae-copd. material and methods: paired samples of subgingival plaque biofilm and tracheal aspirate were collected from 53 patients with severe ae-copd. total bacterial dna was extracted from each sample individually for polymerase chain reaction amplification and/or generation of bacterial 16s rdna sequences and cdna libraries. we used a metagenomic approach, based on bacterial  16s rdna sequences, to compare the distribution of species present in dental plaque and lung. results: analysis of 1060 sequences (20 clones per patient) revealed a wide range of aerobic, anaerobic, pathogenic, opportunistic, novel and uncultivable bacterial species. species indistinguishable between the paired subgingival plaque and tracheal aspirate samples (97-100% similarity in 16s rdna  sequence) were dental plaque pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) and lung pathogens (acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae). real-time polymerase chain reaction of 16s rdna indicated lower levels of pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis colonizing the dental plaques compared with the paired tracheal aspirate samples. conclusion: these results support the  hypothesis that dental bacteria may contribute to the pathology of severe ae-copd.

TI  == clinical and microbiological results following nonsurgical periodontal therapy with or without local administration of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB  == objectives: we assessed if adjunct administration of piperacillin/tazobactam added clinical and microbiological treatment benefits. materials and methods: thirty-six subjects (mean age 52.1 years (sd +/- 10.3)) (ns by group) with chronic periodontitis were randomly enrolled receiving subgingival debridement and the local administration of piperacillin/tazobactam (test group) or debridement alone (control group). bleeding on probing (bop), probing pocket depth (ppd), and microbiological counts of 74 species were studied by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization up to month 6 after treatment. results: mean ppd changes between baseline and month 6 in the test and control groups were 1.5  and 1.8 mm, respectively (ns between groups). bop in both groups decreased from about 80 to 40 %. at 4 and 12 weeks, lower counts of the following bacteria were  found in the test group (site level): fusobacterium species, parvimonas micra, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and a composite load of nine pathogens (p < 0.001). at week 26, subjects receiving local antibiotics had a lower prevalence at tested sites for fusobacterium nucleatum sp. polymorphum, fusobacterium periodonticum, p. micra, and t. denticola. conclusions: at 26 weeks, treatment with or without piperacillin/tazobactam resulted in similar bop and ppd improvements. at week 26  and at the subject level, the prevalence of 4/74 pathogens was found at lower counts in the group receiving local antibiotics. clinical relevance: administration of piperacillin/tazobactam reduces the prevalence of fusobacterium, p. micra, and t. denticola to a greater extent than debridement alone but with no short-term differences in ppd or bop.

TI  == the short-term treatment effects on the microbiota at the dorsum of the tongue in intra-oral halitosis patients--a randomized clinical trial.
AB  == objectives: this study aims to assess the effects of rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse with or without adjunct tongue scraping on volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) in breath air, and the microbiota at the dorsum  of the tongue. material and methods: a randomized single-masked controlled clinical trial with a cross-over study design over 14 days including 21 subjects  was performed. bacterial samples from the dorsum of the tongue were assayed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: no halitosis (identified by vsc assessments) at day 14 was identified in 12/21 subjects with active rinse alone,  in 10/21 with adjunct use of tongue scraper, in 1/21 for negative control rinse alone, and in 3/21 in the control and tongue scraping sequence. at day 14, significantly lower counts were identified only in the active rinse sequence (p < 0.001) for 15/78 species including, fusobacterium sp., porphyromonas gingivalis,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and tannerella forsythia. a decrease in bacteria from baseline to day 14 was found in successfully treated subjects for 9/74 species including: p. gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica, s. aureus, and treponema denticola. baseline vsc scores were correlated with several bacterial species. the use of a tongue scraper combined with active rinse did not change the levels of vsc compared to rinsing alone. conclusions: vsc scores were  not associated with bacterial counts in samples taken from the dorsum of the tongue. the active rinse alone containing zinc and chlorhexidine had effects on intra-oral halitosis and reduced bacterial counts of species associated with malodor. tongue scraping provided no beneficial effects on the microbiota studied. clinical relevance: periodontally healthy subjects with intra-oral halitosis benefit from daily rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse.

TI  == association of red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans and non-oral bacteria with periodontal diseases.
AB  == objective: pathogens related to systemic infections have been detected in the periodontal microbiota. the relationship amongst these pathogens, periodontal bacteria and periodontal clinical status is poorly understood. this study evaluated the association amongst red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans (a.a) and non-oral pathogenic bacteria in subjects with good periodontal health (ph), gingivitis (g), chronic (cp) and aggressive (ap) periodontitis. methods: subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 51 ph, 42 g, 219 cp and 90 ap subjects. the presence and levels of a.a, red complex (porphyromonas gingivalis,  tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola), acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia  coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus were determined by dna probes and dna-dna hybridization technique. results: cp and ap subjects presented significantly higher prevalence and levels of a.a, red  complex and a. baumannii than g and ph individuals (p<0.01), whereas s. aureus was detected in lower frequency and counts in ap as compared to the other groups  (p<0.001). the predictor variables age, prevalence of red complex, and the presence of a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa were strongly associated with the frequency of sites with pd and cal >/=5 mm. increasing age (or 1.08), high frequency of red complex (or 6.10), and the presence of a.a with p. aeruginosa (or 1.90) were associated with periodontal disease (p<0.001). subjects harbouring a high prevalence of a.a, a. baumannii, and red complex with p. aeruginosa were more likely to have ap than cp (p<0.001). conclusion: putative periodontal pathogens and non-oral bacteria alone or in association were strongly associated  with periodontitis.

TI  == clinical and microbiological features of refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the clinical parameters and the  site prevalence and levels of 40 subgingival species in successfully treated and  refractory periodontitis subjects. 94 subjects received scaling and root planing  and if needed, periodontal surgery and systemically administered tetracycline. 28 refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or > 3 sites showing attachment loss > 2.5 mm within 1 year post-therapy. 66 successfully treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss > 2.5 mm. baseline subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the mean levels and % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject and differences between groups sought using the mann-whitney test. most of the 40 species tested, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus, were equally or less prevalent in the refractory group. prevotella nigrescens was significantly more prevalent in successfully treated subjects, while refractory subjects harbored a larger proportion of streptococcus species, particularly streptococcus constellatus. the odds of a subject being refractory was 8.6 (p < 0.001) if s. constellatus constituted > or = 3.5% of the  total dna probe count. since few microbiological differences existed between treatment outcome groups using dna probes to known species, the predominant cultivable microbiota of 33 subgingival samples from 14 refractory subjects was examined. 85% of the 1649 isolates were identified using probes to 69 recognized  subgingival species. the remaining unidentified strains were classified by analyzing 16s rrna gene sequences. many sequenced isolates were of taxa not considered a common part of the oral microbiota such as acinetobacter baumanni, gemella haemolysans, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus warneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa and novel species in the genera bartonella, ralstonia, neisseria, eubacterium, rothia, gordona, gemella, corynebacterium, leptotrichia, and actinomyces. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their subgingival microbiota. as a group, they did not harbor more of the "classic" periodontopathogens, although elevated proportions of s. constellatus were found.
