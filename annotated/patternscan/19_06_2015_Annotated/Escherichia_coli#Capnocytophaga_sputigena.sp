TI  == [utility of prolonged incubation and terminal subcultures of blood cultures from  immunocompromised patients].
AB  == the value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the fundacion favaloro, the fundacion para la lucha contra las enfermedades neurologicas de la infancia and the hospital de ninos ricardo gutierrez. a total  of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). bact-alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees c for 30 days in the bact-alert system. bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and sabouraud agar. a total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. the positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). the median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. the microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), escherichia coli (n = 18), acinetobacter spp (n = 9), candida spp (n = 8), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), enterococcus faecalis, salmonella spp and capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecium, citrobacter diversus, candida albicans, klebsiella oxytoca, chryseomonas luteola, serratia marcescens, abiotrophia spp, campylobacter jejuni, moraxella catarrhalis, moraxella urethralis, neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group g streptococci, rhodococcus equi, micrococcus spp, cryptococcus neoformans  and streptococcus mitis (n = 1). in our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.

TI  == subgingival microflora in smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  == cigarette smoking is a potent risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. the objective of this study was to detect the microbial profile of early onset periodontitis in smokers and compare it to that  of non-smokers. the study population consisted of 50 systemically healthy individuals aged 25 to 38 years, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. 25 patients were smokers (> 20 cigarettes/day) and 25 non-smokers. two pooled bacterial samples comprised of four periodontal sites with probing depth > 5 mm each, were collected from each individual. the samples were cultured aerobically  and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. the differences in bacterial counts using  the mann whitney u test were statistically significant for staphylococcus aureus, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens, escherichia coli, bacteroides forsythus, bacteroides gracilis, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis,  selenomonas sputigena and candida albicans in smokers. statistically significant  differences for peptostreptococcus micros, actinomyces naeslundii, eubacterium lentum and capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in non-smokers. the isolation  of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora like e. coli, c. albicans and s. aureus in smokers microflora underscores the importance of the host which is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.

TI  == novel fnr homologues identified in four representative oral facultative anaerobes: capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, haemophilus aphrophilus, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == based upon dna sequence data and positive immunochemical reactivity of expressed  protein, novel homologues of the fnr family were identified in four representative oral facultative anaerobes: capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, haemophilus aphrophilus, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the similarity to e. coli fnr and to hlyx (itself 71% similar to e. coli fnr, while regulating expression of hemolysin operon in actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae) was estimated from the deduced partial amino acid sequence to be, in the above order of tested species, 98, 98, 86, and 85%, and 75, 75, 88, and 88%, respectively. the phylogenetic relatedness indicates a rather closer link of hlyx to the fnr homologues from both pathogens, h. aphrophilus and a. actinomycetemcomitans. the possibility that the a. actinomycetemcomitans fnr homologue functions as a redox-sensing transcriptional  factor to regulate, in addition to anaerobic respiration, microaerobic expression of the leukotoxin operon (ltx gene) is suggested.

TI  == b-cell mitogenicity and il-1 beta production of lipopolysaccharides from various  capnocytophaga strains.
AB  == to evaluate the etiological roles of capnocytophaga species in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease, we examined the immunological activities of lipopolysaccharides (lpss) from various capnocytophaga strains. all lpss from various capnocytophaga species were mitogenic for balb/c mouse spleen cells, although the responses were lower than those to reference lpss from escherichia coli or salmonella typhimurium. lpss of c. sputigena strains had polyclonal b cell activation and adjuvant activity and were comparable to reference lpss. all  lpss from capnocytophaga strains activated the interleukin-1 beta production from human peripheral monocytes, although the inducing activities of capnocytophaga lpss were lower than those of reference lpss. it appears that lpss from various capnocytophaga strains activate certain immunological responses from lymphocytes  and monocytes which may be important in the development and pathogenesis of periodontal disease.

TI  == lipopolysaccharides from various capnocytophaga strains possess potent limulus amoebocyte lysate clotting activity.
AB  == lipopolysaccharides (lpss) were extracted by the hot phenol-water method from three atcc strains (c. sputigena atcc 33612, c. ochracea atcc 33596, and c. gingivalis atcc 33624) and three clinical isolates (c. sputigena te-1, c. ochracea ono-26, and c. gingivalis m-12). endospecy was used to determine the limulus amoebocyte lysate clotting activities. the activities of lpss from capnocytophaga strains were stronger than those of escherichia coli, with the exception of the lps from c. gingivalis m-12. except for the lps from c. sputigena te-1, the sds-page analyses of these preparations showed slow-migrating and repeating ladder bands similar to the lpss of e. coli and salmonella typhimurium (wild type) and included both the core-lipid a region and various lengths of o-antigen. the lps from c. sputigena te-1 possessed fast-migrating bands and did not have an o-side chain.

TI  == in vitro killing of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and capnocytophaga spp.  by human neutrophil cathepsin g and elastase.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to compare the killing of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans with that of capnocytophaga spp. by purified cathepsin g and elastase in vitro. both were sensitive to killing by purified cathepsin g, but only the capnocytophaga spp. were killed by elastase. killing by cathepsin g  exhibited logarithmic kinetics, was enhanced slightly by alkaline ph, and was enhanced greatly under hypotonic conditions. treatment of cathepsin g with diisopropyl fluorophosphate significantly reduced its bactericidal activity against capnocytophaga spp. but not against escherichia coli or a. actinomycetemcomitans. the bactericidal effects of cathepsin g against capnocytophaga sputigena and a. actinomycetemcomitans were inhibited by alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, and alpha-2-macroglobulin but not  by bovine serum albumin. we conclude that (i) cathepsin g kills capnocytophaga spp. and a. actinomycetemcomitans, (ii) elastase kills capnocytophaga spp., (iii) the bactericidal activity of cathepsin g is enzyme dependent against capnocytophaga spp. and enzyme independent against a. actinomycetemcomitans, and  (iv) natural plasma antiproteases may control both enzyme-dependent and enzyme-independent bactericidal activities of cathepsin g.

TI  == in vitro killing of oral capnocytophaga by granule fractions of human neutrophils is associated with cathepsin g activity.
AB  == the capnocytophaga are inhabitants of the hypoxic human gingival crevice that are normally prevented by neutrophils from causing periodontal and systemic infection. to identify potential nonoxidative bactericidal mechanisms against capnocytophaga within human neutrophils, gel filtration chromatography was used to fractionate neutrophil granule extracts. seven granule fractions, designated a through g, were obtained. the capnocytophaga were most sensitive to killing by fraction d. fraction d exhibited substantial bactericidal activity under aerobic  and anaerobic conditions. the bactericidal activity associated with ion-exchange  subfractions d8-d11, which contained primarily cathepsin g as assessed by enzymatic activity, amino acid composition, and nh2-terminal sequence. heat-inactivation, diisopropylfluorophosphate, pmsf, and n-benzyloxycarbonylglycylleucylphenylalanyl-chloromethyl ketone inhibited bactericidal activity against capnocytophaga sputigena but not escherichia coli.  we conclude that (a) human neutrophil cathepsin g is an important antimicrobial system against the capnocytophaga, (b) the bactericidal activity of cathepsin g against capnocytophaga is oxygen independent, and (c) an intact enzyme active site is involved in the killing of c. sputigena but not e. coli. we suggest that  human neutrophil cathepsin g is an important antimicrobial system against certain oral bacteria and that cathepsin g kills bacteria by two distinct mechanisms.

TI  == biological and chemical characterization of endotoxin from capnocytophaga sputigena.
AB  == an endotoxin was isolated from capnocytophaga sputigena strain 4 by a modification of the hot phenol-water method. the extraction procedure yielded a lipopolysaccharide which accounted for approximately 1.5% of the dry weight of the cells. the material was composed of 18.6% lipid (as c(15) fatty acid), 46.5%  neutral sugar including 9.6% hexose, 18.3% 6-deoxy sugar, 1.0% 2-keto-3-deoxy sugar, and 4.8% heptose. hexosamine, protein, and phosphorus were found in quantities amounting to 9.0, 2.9, and 2.0% of the dry weight, respectively. no pentose or nucleic acid was detected. acid hydrolysis resulted in the release of  the constituent sugars and the formation of an insoluble precipitate. the lipopolysaccharide was tested for numerous biological activities characteristic of endotoxins. the pyrogenicity was relatively low; the fever index 40 was 17 mug, and 10 mug was required to give the characteristic biphasic fever response.  the toxicity of the extract was very low, with a 50% chicken embryo lethal dose of 15.6 mug and a 50% mouse embryo lethal dose of greater than 8 mg. similarly, the c. sputigena endotoxin had modest effects on leukocytes when compared with endotoxin standards from other organisms. the extract exhibited little or no mitogenicity when tested on mouse spleen lymphocytes. it was not toxic to human peripheral polymorphonuclear leukocytes and caused the release of only a small (13%) portion of lysosomal enzymes. although the c. sputigena lipopolysaccharide  caused significant activation of mouse peritoneal macrophages, the dose required  was twice that of an escherichia coli endotoxic standard. however, the limulus amoebocyte lysate clotting activity of the lipopolysaccharide was comparable to that of an serratia marcescens lipopolysaccharide standard, and passive hemagglutination tests revealed that 1 mug of the lipopolysaccharide was capable  of sensitizing 1 ml of a 2% sheep erythrocyte suspension for agglutination with an antiserum prepared against c. sputigena whole cells.
