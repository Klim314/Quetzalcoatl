TI  == role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature  search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment  of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase  production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in  vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with  s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between  probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus reuteri on the proliferation of propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  == while it is generally accepted that propionibacterium acnes is involved in the development of acne, other bacteria including staphylococcus epidermidis have also been isolated from the acne lesion. the interaction between lactobacillus reuteri, a probiotic bacterium, and acnegenic bacteria is unclear. this study examined the effects of l. reuteri on the proliferation of p. acnes and s. epidermidis. human-derived l. reuteri strains (kctc 3594 and kctc 3678) and rat-derived l. reuteri kctc 3679 were used. all strains exhibited significant inhibitory effects on the growth of p. acnes and s. epidermidis. the proliferation of p. acnes was decreased by 2-log scales after incubation with l.  reuteri for 24 h. in addition, the proliferation of s. epidermidis was decreased  by 3-log scales after incubation with l. reuteri for 24 h, whereas the growth of  l. reuteri was unaffected by p. acnes or s. epidermidis. among the l. reuteri strains examined, l. reuteri kctc 3679 had the strongest inhibitory effect on the growth of p. acnes and s. epidermidis, followed by l. reuteri kctc 3594 and l. reuteri kctc 3678. interestingly, reuterin, an antimicrobial factor, was produced only by l. reuteri kctc 3594. the most pronounced the antibacterial activities of l. reuteri were attributed to the production of organic acids. overall, these results suggest that l. reuteri may be a useful probiotic agent to control the growth of bacteria involved in acne inflammation and prevent acne.

TI  == linoleic acid isomerase from propionibacterium acnes: purification, characterization, molecular cloning, and heterologous expression.
AB  == propionibacterium acnes strain atcc 6919 catalyzes the isomerization of the double bond at the c9 position in linoleic acid (c9,c12, 18:2) to form t10,c12 conjugated linoleic acid (cla, 18:2). cla has significant health benefits in animal and human. the linoleic acid c9 isomerase was purified to an apparent homogeneity by successive chromatography on diethylaminoethyl (deae) anion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and chromatofocusing columns. two degenerated  oligonucleotide primers were synthesized according to the n-terminal peptide sequence to clone, by polymerase chain reaction (pcr), a short nucleotide sequence (62 bp) of the isomerase gene. the linoleic acid isomerase gene (lai) was subsequently cloned by inverse pcr. the amino acid sequence deduced from the  lai coding sequence predicts a protein of 424 amino acid residues (48 kda), excluding the n-terminal methionine, which was absent in the polypeptide purified from the native host. the isomerase shares no significant sequence homology to other enzymes except a flavin-binding domain in the n-terminal region. the recombinant isomerase purified from escherichia coli showed a typical ultraviolet spectrum for fad-bound proteins. the recombinant enzyme produced a single isomer  of t10,c12-cla from linoleic acid, as demonstrated by gas chromatography and gas  chromatography-mass spectrum analysis. the recombinant isomerase protein was expressed at high levels in e. coli, but it was almost totally sequestered in inclusion bodies. the level of active isomerase was increased 376-fold by medium  and process optimization in bench-scale fermentors.
