TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI  == bacterial examination of endodontic infections by clonal analysis in concert with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to examine the diversity of bacterial  species in the infected root canals of teeth associated with endodontic abscesses by cloning and sequencing techniques in concert with denaturing high-performance  liquid chromatography. methods: samples collected from five infected root canals  were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with universal 16s ribosomal dna primers. products of these pcrs were cloned and sequenced. denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dhplc) was used as a screening method to  reduce the number of clones necessary for dna sequencing. results: all samples were positive for the presence of bacteria and a range of 7-13 different bacteria were found per root canal sample. in total, 48 different oral clones were detected among the five root canal samples. olsenella profusa was the only species present in all samples. porphyromonas gingivalis, dialister pneumosintes, dialister invisus, lachnospiraceae oral clone, staphylococcus aureus, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, peptostreptococcus micros and enterococcus faecalis were found in two of the five samples. the majority of the taxa were present in only one sample, for example tannerella forsythia, shuttleworthia satelles and filifactor alocis. some facultative anaerobes that are frequently isolated from endodontic infections such as e. faecalis, streptococcus anginosus  and lactobacillus spp. were also found in this study. conclusion: clonal analysis of the microflora associated with endodontic infections revealed a wide diversity of oral species.

TI  == molecular analysis of filifactor alocis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola associated with primary endodontic infections and failed endodontic treatment.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the presence of strict anaerobes such as filifactor alocis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola in primary and secondary root-infected canals with periapical lesions by molecular analysis and  the association of these species with specific endodontic signs and symptoms. microbial samples were taken from 100 root canals, 50 with necrotic pulp tissues  (npt, primary infection), and 50 with failed endodontic treatment (fet, secondary infection). dna was extracted from the samples, which were analyzed for the presence of three endodontic pathogens using species-specific primers and pcr. f. alocis were isolated from 23 canals with npt and 12 canals with fet; t. forsythia from 12 canals with npt and three canals with fet; t. denticola from 19 canals with npt and 12 canals with tep. suggested associations were found between primary infection and the presence of f. alocis and t. forsythia (both p < 0.05). in particular, associations were found between: pain and f. alocis; swelling and  f. alocis; tenderness to percussion and t. forsythia; mobility and t. forsythia and t. denticola; wet canals and f. alocis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola; purulent exsudate and f. alocis, t. forsythia and t. denticola; abscess and f. alocis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola (all p < 0.05). the findings of this study indicated that f. alocis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola seem to be associated with endodontic signs and symptoms. additionally, f. alocis and t. forsythia were detected more frequently in teeth with necrotic pulp than in teeth with failing endodontic treatment.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacteria in asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to use terminal restriction fragment length  polymorphism analysis and the 16s rrna gene clone library to investigate the diversity of the microbiota associated with asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections and to compare the bacterial community structure in these two clinical conditions. samples were taken from asymptomatic endodontic infections associated with chronic periradicular lesions and from symptomatic infections clinically diagnosed as acute abscesses. 16s rrna genes from dna isolated from clinical samples were used to construct clone libraries or were subjected to terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. sequence analysis of 186 clones revealed 42 taxa; 23 (55%) were uncultivated phylotypes, of which seven were unique to endodontic infections. clone sequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed that the most commonly detected taxa were fusobacterium nucleatum (including terminal restriction fragment types 1 and 2), peptostreptococcus micros/peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone aj062/bs044/fg014, prevotella species, dialister species, mogibacterium species, lachnospiraceae oral clone 55a-34, filifactor alocis, megasphaera sp. oral clone cs025/bs073, and veillonella sp. oral clone bp1-85/veillonella dispar/v. parvula. bacteroides-like sp. oral clone x083/bacteroidales oral clone mce7_20 and dialister sp. oral clone bs016/mce7_134 were detected only in asymptomatic teeth. on the other hand, f. nucleatum terminal restriction fragment type 2, prevotella intermedia, dialister pneumosintes, and some phylotypes were exclusively detected in symptomatic samples. bacterial profiles of symptomatic endodontic infections generated by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis were clearly different from those of asymptomatic infections. overall, the average number of terminal restriction fragments in symptomatic samples was significantly larger than in asymptomatic samples. molecular analysis of the microbiota associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic endodontic infections indicates that the endodontic bacterial diversity is greater than previously described by culture methods and that the structure of the microbiota differ significantly between asymptomatic and symptomatic infections.
