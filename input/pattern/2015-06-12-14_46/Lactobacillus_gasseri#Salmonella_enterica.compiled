TI  - Interactions of Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium with  gut bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the gut microbiota on the growth and survival of S. Typhimurium. This was tested in two-species co-cultures and in mixed cultures with a simplified gut model microbiota. Subsequently, interactions between S. Typhimurium and human faecal bacteria were quantified in both batch and continuous culture systems simulating the human colon. The exponential growth of S. Typhimurium was halted when the population of Escherichia coli reached the maximum population density in a two-compartment co-culture system where the two species were separated by a 0.45 mum pore membrane. Furthermore, the growth of some gut bacteria such as Lactobacillus gasseri and Bifidobacterium bifidum was inhibited by the presence of S. Typhimurium in the other compartment. The survival of S. Typhimurium was severely affected in mixed batch cultures with human faecal samples; a reduction of 10(3)-10(4) cfu/ml in the concentration of S. Typhimurium was observed in these cultures. However, no effect on S. Typhimurium survival was observed in mixed batch cultures with a simplified gut model microbiota under the same conditions. The effect of human faecal samples on S. Typhimurium in a three-stage continuous culture was different to that obtained in batch cultures; its growth rather than survival was affected under these conditions. S. Typhimurium growth was inhibited, and the bacterium was therefore eliminated by the continuous flow of the medium. Depending upon culturing conditions, the gut microbiota caused either growth inhibition, inactivation or did not affect S. Typhimurium.
TI  - Individual and co-operative roles of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide in the killing activity of enteric strain Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC933 and vaginal strain Lactobacillus gasseri KS120.1 against enteric, uropathogenic and vaginosis-associated pathogens.
AB  - The mechanism underlying the killing activity of Lactobacillus strains against bacterial pathogens appears to be multifactorial. Here, we investigate the respective contributions of hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid in killing bacterial pathogens associated with the human vagina, urinary tract or intestine by two hydrogen peroxide-producing strains. In co-culture, the human intestinal strain Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC933 and human vaginal strain Lactobacillus gasseri KS120.1 strains killed enteric Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344, vaginal Gardnerella vaginalis DSM 4944 and urinary tract Escherichia coli CFT073 pathogens. The cell-free culture supernatants (CFCSs) produced the same reduction in SL1344, DSM 4944 and CFT073 viability, whereas isolated bacteria had no effect. The killing activity of CFCSs was heat-stable. In the presence of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimum essential medium inhibiting the lactic acid-dependent killing activity, CFCSs were less effective at killing of the pathogens. Catalase-treated CFCSs displayed a strong decreased activity. Tested alone, hydrogen peroxide triggered a concentration-dependent killing activity against all three pathogens. Lactic acid alone developed a killing activity only at concentrations higher than that present in CFCSs. In the presence of lactic acid at a concentration present in Lactobacillus CFCSs, hydrogen peroxide displayed enhanced killing activity. Collectively, these results demonstrate that for hydrogen peroxide-producing Lactobacillus strains, the main metabolites of Lactobacillus, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide, act co-operatively to kill enteric, vaginosis-associated and uropathogenic pathogens.
TI  - Characterization of Lactobacillus spp. isolated from the feces of breast-feeding  piglets.
AB  - Lactobacillus spp., referred to as IJ-1 and IJ-2, were isolated from the feces of breast-feeding piglets and analyzed for probiotic properties. According to the analyses of 16S rDNA sequence, Lactobacillus sp. IJ-1 showed greater than 99% homology with Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 20016(T), and Lactobacillus sp. IJ-2 had greater than 99% homology with the L. gasseri ATCC 33323(T) and L. johnsonii ATCC 33200(T). The pH changes in the culture media of Lactobacillus sp. IJ-1 and Lactobacillus sp. IJ-2 were from 6.5 to 4.2 and 4.6, respectively. Their respective resistance against artificial gastric acid and artificial bile acid led to survival rates of nearly 186+/-44% and 13+/-5%. Neither strain produced the carcinogenic enzyme beta-glucuronidase. Both strains inhibited the growth of pathogenic microorganisms, such as Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19111, Salmonella enterica KCTC 12401, Salmonella enteritidis ATCC 13076, Staphylococcus aureus KCTC 3881, and Bacillus cereus 3711, within 24 h of growth.
TI  - Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium adhesion and cytotoxicity during epithelial cell stress is reduced by Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physiological stressors may alter susceptibility of the host intestinal epithelium to infection by enteric pathogens. In the current study, cytotoxic effect, adhesion and invasion of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) to Caco-2 cells exposed to thermal stress (41 degrees C, 1 h) was investigated. Probiotic bacteria have been shown to reduce interaction of pathogens with the epithelium under non-stress conditions and may have a significant effect on epithelial viability during infection; however, probiotic effect on pathogen interaction with epithelial cells under physiological stress is not known. Therefore, we investigated the influence of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactobacillus gasseri on Salmonella adhesion and Salmonella-induced cytotoxicity of Caco-2 cells subjected to thermal stress. RESULTS: Thermal stress increased the cytotoxic effect of both S. Typhimurium (P = 0.0001) and nonpathogenic E. coli K12 (P = 0.004) to Caco-2 cells, and resulted in greater susceptibility of cell monolayers to S. Typhimurium adhesion (P = 0.001). Thermal stress had no significant impact on inflammatory cytokines released by Caco-2 cells, although exposure to S. Typhimurium resulted in greater than 80% increase in production of IL-6 and IL-8. Blocking S. Typhimurium with anti-ShdA antibody prior to exposure of Salmonella decreased adhesion (P = 0.01) to non-stressed and thermal-stressed Caco-2 cells. Pre-exposure of Caco-2 cells to L. rhamnosus GG significantly reduced Salmonella-induced cytotoxicity (P = 0.001) and Salmonella adhesion (P = 0.001) to Caco-2 cells during thermal stress, while L. gasseri had no effect. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that thermal stress increases susceptibility of intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells to Salmonella adhesion, and increases the cytotoxic effect of Salmonella during infection. Use of L. rhamnosus GG as a probiotic may reduce the severity of infection during epithelial cell stress. Mechanisms by which thermal stress increases susceptibility to S. Typhimurium colonization and by which L. rhamnosus GG limits the severity of infection remain to be elucidated.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide production by Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC 533 and its role in anti-Salmonella activity.
AB  - The human intestinal isolate Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC 533 (La1) is a probiotic strain with well-documented antimicrobial properties. Previous research has identified the production of lactic acid and bacteriocins as important factors, but that other unidentified factors are also involved. We used the recently published genome sequence of L. johnsonii NCC 533 to search for novel antipathogen factors and identified three potential gene products that may catalyze the synthesis of the known antimicrobial factor hydrogen peroxide, H(2)O(2). In this work, we confirmed the ability of NCC 533 as well as eight different L. johnsonii strains and Lactobacillus gasseri to produce H(2)O(2) when resting cells were incubated in the presence of oxygen, and that culture supernatant containing NCC 533-produced H(2)O(2) was effective in killing the model pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344 in vitro.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of milkfat globule membrane fractions.
AB  - Milkfat globule membranes (MFGMs) were prepared from bovine cream according to standard procedures. These membranes and peptide hydrolysates, which were generated by proteolysis with immobilized digestive enzymes, were screened for antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica Typhimurium, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bacillus cereus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus gasseri. Assays were first performed on beef heart infusion (BHI) plates spotted with test protein-peptide fractions and then seeded with lawns of indicator cells to monitor the zone of growth inhibition. Under these experimental conditions, MFGMs were most active against Salmonella Typhimurium and P. fluorescens. However, antibacterial activity was not seen after plating on Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. We determined that the antimicrobial effects observed on BHI plates were due to the generation of H2O2 by xanthine oxidase, a major protein constituent of the MFGMs, as a result of purine catalysis. This substrate is present in BHI but lacking in LB medium. Evaluation of purified xanthine oxidase alone resulted in analogous data trends. The growth of probiotic Lactobacillus strains were affected only marginally when grown on lactobacilli deMan Rogosa Sharpe plates, suggesting the decreased sensitivity of these bacteria to H2O2. In this study, several MFGM hydrolysates exhibited variable antibacterial activity against test food pathogens on agar plates prepared with M9 minimal media, and this variation was not attributable to xanthine oxidase enzymatic activity. The probiotic microorganisms were mostly resilient to these antibacterial fractions. Bovine MFGM fractions may represent an excellent resource material from which to generate native, naturally occurring biodefensive proteins and/or peptides.
TI  - Subtractive screening for probiotic properties of lactobacillus species from the  human gastrointestinal tract in the search for new probiotics.
AB  - In the search for new probiotics, 61 Lactobacillus spp. isolates, belonging to 12 species and isolated as dominant lactic acid bacteria from the feces of healthy humans, were subjected to a subtractive system of in vitro analyses, which included desirable and undesirable traits. Twenty-four isolates were able to grow in 2% bovine bile, of which 13 grew in acidified broth at pH 3.5 in acidified cysteine-containing MRS broth. Intrinsic resistance to certain antimicrobial agents (cefoxitin, metronidazole, vancomycin) was observed in most isolates, but atypical resistances to erythromycin, clindamycin, or tetracycline were also found in 5 strains. Undesirable traits such as alpha-chymotrypsin or N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase activities were not detected, but low beta-glucuronidase and moderate beta-glucosidase activities were recorded in 2 strains. Two Lactobacillus gasseri and 2 Lactobacillus paracasei selected strains inhibited several intestinal pathogens in an agar spot test, including strains of Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus. They also adhered to human Caco-2 and HT-29 epithelial cells in a manner comparable to Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG, and were unable to degrade pig gastric mucin in a plate assay. Together, these results suggest these 4 strains to be good probiotic candidates, concluding that the subtractive screening devised in this work could be a valuable tool in large-scale surveys for probiotics.
TI  - Interference of Salmonella enteritidis and Lactobacillus spp. with IL-8 levels and transepithelial electrical resistance of enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells.
AB  - Caco-2 cells (exhibiting characteristics of mature villus enterocytes) were used  to determine bacteria (Salmonella enteritidis causing human gastroenteritis)-intestinal cell interactions. The interference of bacteria with the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of filter-grown Caco-2 cells and the production of IL-8 after exposure of the cells to S. enteritidis 857 and/or Lactobacillus strains (L. gasseri LF221 and L. rhamnosus BGT10) was evaluated. The strain 857 decreased TEER of filter-grown Caco-2 cells; in contrast, lactobacilli had a little or no effect. The effect of S. enteritidis on the TEER decreased if Caco-2 cells were pre-incubated with lactobacilli. This strain induced high levels of IL-8 (which can lead to cell damage). Compared to the IL-8 synthesis after exposure of Caco-2 cells to S. enteritidis 857, simultaneous exposure of Caco-2 cells to S. enteritidis and lactobacilli inhibited the IL-8 synthesis after short recovery periods.
TI  - Some probiotic properties of vaginal lactobacilli isolated from healthy women.
AB  - Lactobacilli have long been considered to be protective flora in the vagina. In this study, samples were taken from the lateral vaginal wall of 19 healthy women, and 58 strains of Lactobacillus spp. were isolated from 10 of these women. The identification results revealed that Lactobacillus gasseri was the predominant lactobacilli in healthy women. The amounts of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) produced by Lactobacillus spp. were determined. The vaginal pH levels induced by Lactobacillus spp. strains ranged from 1.00 to 2.15. The titratable acidity of the strains ranged from 0.27 to 1.33%. The H(2)O(2) concentration produced in the lactobacilli strains ranged between 1.01 microg/ml and 15.50 microg/ml. The antimicrobial effects of the lactobacilli against the pathogenic bacteria Escherichia coli ATCC 11230, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 2392, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 29212 and Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis RSKK 171 were also determined by the agar diffusion methods.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus species against Vibrio species.
AB  - Forty-one Lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of Vibrio. L. plantarum and L. casei were the most effective, and L. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of Vibrio species. L. gasseri and L. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while L. reuteri and L. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against Vibrio species. L. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against Vibrio species. However, none of the Lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of Salmonella enteritidis, S. typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. Inhibition of the Vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the Lactobacillus species.
