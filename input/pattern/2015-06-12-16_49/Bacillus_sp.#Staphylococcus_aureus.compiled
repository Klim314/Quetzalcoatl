TI  - Antibacterial activity of ovary extract from sea urchin Diadema setosum.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sea urchin gonad is considered as a highly prized delicacy in several  countries. It is also rich in valuable bioactive compounds including polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and beta-carotene. This study was undertaken to examine the antimicrobial properties of the ovary extract from sea urchin Diadema setosum against selected Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ovary extract was obtained using two different solvents such as methanol and chloroform. The obtained extract was used to examine its potential antimicrobial properties against the following 11 bacterial species using the disc diffusion method: Gram-negative bacteria (Salmonella typhi, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila, Acinetobacter sp, Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella pneumonia) and Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus). The activity was measured in terms of zone of inhibition (mm). RESULTS: The methanol extract exhibited a higher zone of inhibition against all the bacteria taken for examination. Whereas, the ovary extract obtained by chloroform did not show any antimicrobial activity against S. typhi, S. epidermidis, C. freundii and K. pneumonia. The results indicated that the ovary extract obtained by methanol extracts are capable of inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microbes taken for analysis. Moreover, the result indicates the presence of antimicrobial agents in sea urchin ovary. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that the ovary extract of D. setosum may be a potential source of antimicrobial agent for pathogenic microorganisms.
TI  - [Probiotic features of carotene producing strains Bacillus sp. 1.1 and B. amyloliquefaciens UCM B-5113].
AB  - Researched probiotic properties of carotinproducing strains Bacillus sp. 1.1 and  B. amyloliquefaciens UCM B-5113. It was established that Bacillus sp. 1.1 characterized by high and middle antagonistic activity against museums and actual test cultures and B. amyloliquefaciens UCM B-5113 shown middle and low activity. They grew up and formed a pigment at pH 6.0 in the presence of 0.4% bile. Bacillus sp. 1.1 and B. amyloliquefaciens UCM B-5113 were avirulent, had low antagonistic activity and characterized by susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, excluding colistin. The results suggested the possibility to create based on Bacillus sp. 1.1 and B. amyloliquefaciens UCM B-5113 probiotic preparation.
TI  - New polyphenols from a deep sea Spiromastix sp. Fungus, and their antibacterial activities.
AB  - Eleven new polyphenols namely spiromastols A-K (1-11) were isolated from the fermentation broth of a deep sea-derived fungus Spiromastix sp. MCCC 3A00308. Their structures were determined by extensive NMR data and mass spectroscopic analysis in association with chemical conversion. The structures are classified as diphenyl ethers, diphenyl esters and isocoumarin derivatives, while the n-propyl group in the analogues is rarely found in natural products. Compounds 1-3 exhibited potent inhibitory effects against a panel of bacterial strains, including Xanthomanes vesicatoria, Pseudomonas lachrymans, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Ralstonia solanacearum, Bacillus thuringensis, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 0.25 to 4 microg/mL. The structure-activity relationships are discussed, while the polychlorinated analogues 1-3 are assumed to be a promising structural model for further development as antibacterial agents.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activities of Streptomyces polymachus sp. nov. isolated from soil.
AB  - Strain T258T was isolated from the forest soil at Bongnae Falls, South Korea. The strain exhibited antimicrobial and antifungal activity against the following strains: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Paenibacillus larvae, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus niger. Growth occurred on all tested ISP media (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7), Czapek-Dox agar, potato dextrose agar, trypticase soy agar, Bennett's modified agar, and nutrient agar at 28 degrees C. Aerial spores were produced solely on ISP Medium 4; the colour of the aerial mycelia were white and the substrate mycelia were ivory. Melanin production was negative on peptone-yeast extract iron agar (ISP Medium 6). The cell-wall peptidoglycan contained LL-diaminopimelic acid, glutamic acid, alanine, and glycine. Whole-cell hydrolysates contained glucose, ribose, and galactose. The predominant menaquinones were MK-9(H6) and MK-9(H8) while the minor menaquinone was MK-10(H2). The polar lipids included diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylinositol. The major fatty acids (>10 %) were C16:0 (29.8 %), summed feature 3 (C16:1omega7c and/or C16:1omega6c) (15.1 %), anteiso-C15:0 (13.5 %), and iso-C15:0 (10.3 %). DNA-DNA similarity with other strains ranged between 37.84 +/- 1.15 % to 50.25 +/- 1.91 %. Based on these data, we suggest that strain T258T is a novel species that belong to the genus Streptomyces, for which we propose a name Streptomyces polymachus sp. nov. The type strain is T258T (=KACC 18247T=KEMB 9005-212T=NBRC 110905T).
TI  - Antimicrobial and immunomodulatory efficacy of extracellularly synthesized silver and gold nanoparticles by a novel phosphate solubilizing fungus Bipolaris tetramera.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Particulates of nanometers size have occupied a significant area in the field of medicinal and agricultural purposes due to their large surface-to-volume ratio and exceptional physicochemical, electronic and mechanical properties. Myconanotechnology, an interface between mycology and nanotechnology is budding nowadays for nanoparticle-fabrication using fungus or its metabolites. In the present study, we have isolated and characterized a novel phosphate solubilizing fungus B. tetramera KF934408 from rhizospheric soil. This phosphatase releasing fungus was subjected to extracellular synthesis of metal nanoparticles by redox reaction. RESULTS: Silver (AgNPs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were characterized by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopic analysis. The formulated AgNPs were irregular shaped with a size ranging between 54.78 nm to 73.49 nm whereas AuNPs were spherical or hexagonal, with a size of 58.4 and 261.73 nm, respectively. The nanoparticles were assessed for their antibacterial and antifungal efficacy. The results showed effective antimicrobial activity of AgNPs against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter aeroginosa and Trichoderma sp. at higher concentrations, however, AuNPs possessed only moderate antibacterial efficacy while they found no antifungal activity. Cytotoxicity analysis of nanoparticles on J774 and THP1 alpha cell lines revealed the dose dependence in case of AgNPs, while AuNPs were non-toxic at both low and high doses. Furthermore, significant elevation of intracellular ROS was observed after 4 h of incubation with both the nanoparticles. The capping of fungal proteins on the particulates might be involved in the activities demonstrated by these inert metal nanoparticles. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the findings showed that the metal nanoparticles synthesized by fungus B. tetramera could be used as an antimicrobial agents as well as cost effective and nontoxic immunomodulatory delivery vehicle.
TI  - Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis CBMDC3f with antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive foodborne pathogenic bacteria: UV-MALDI-TOF MS analysis of its bioactive compounds.
AB  - In this work a new Bacillus sp. strain, isolated from honey, was characterized phylogenetically. Its antibacterial activity against three relevant foodborne pathogenic bacteria was studied; the main bioactive metabolites were analyzed using ultraviolet matrix assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry (UV-MALDI MS). Bacillus CBMDC3f was phylogenetically characterized as Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis after rRNA analysis of the 16S subunit and the gyrA gene (access codes Genbank JX120508 and JX120516, respectively). Its antibacterial potential was evaluated against Listeria monocytogenes (9 strains), B. cereus (3 strains) and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC29213. Its cell suspension and cell-free supernatant (CFS) exerted significant anti-Listeria and anti-S. aureus activities, while the lipopeptides fraction (LF) also showed anti-B. cereus effect. The UV-MALDI-MS analysis revealed surfactin, iturin and fengycin in the CFS, whereas surfactin predominated in the LF. The CFS from CBMDC3f contained surfactin, iturin and fengycin with four, two and four homologues per family, respectively, whereas four surfactin, one iturin and one fengycin homologues were identified in the LF. For some surfactin homologues, their UV-MALDI-TOF/TOF (MS/MS; Laser Induced Decomposition method, LID) spectra were also obtained. Mass spectrometry analysis contributed with relevant information about the type of lipopeptides that Bacillus strains can synthesize. From our results, surfactin would be the main metabolite responsible for the antibacterial effect.
TI  - Functional gene-based discovery of phenazines from the actinobacteria associated  with marine sponges in the South China Sea.
AB  - Phenazines represent a large group of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds  produced by the diverse group of bacteria including actinobacteria. In this study, a total of 197 actinobacterial strains were isolated from seven different marine sponge species in the South China Sea using five different culture media. Eighty-seven morphologically different actinobacterial strains were selected and grouped into 13 genera, including Actinoalloteichus, Kocuria, Micrococcus, Micromonospora, Mycobacterium, Nocardiopsis, Prauserella, Rhodococcus, Saccharopolyspora, Salinispora, Serinicoccus, and Streptomyces by the phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene. Based on the screening of phzE genes, ten strains, including five Streptomyces, two Nocardiopsis, one Salinispora, one Micrococcus, and one Serinicoccus were found to be potential for phenazine production. The level of phzE gene expression was highly expressed in Nocardiopsis sp. 13-33-15, 13-12-13, and Serinicoccus sp. 13-12-4 on the fifth day of fermentation. Finally, 1,6-dihydroxy phenazine (1) from Nocardiopsis sp. 13-33-15 and 13-12-13, and 1,6-dimethoxy phenazine (2) from Nocardiopsis sp. 13-33-15 were isolated and identified successfully based on ESI-MS and NMR analysis. The compounds 1 and 2 showed antibacterial activity against Bacillus mycoides SJ14, Staphylococcus aureus SJ51, Escherichia coli SJ42, and Micrococcus luteus SJ47. This study suggests that the integrated approach of gene screening and chemical analysis is an effective strategy to find the target compounds and lays the basis for the production of phenazine from the sponge-associated actinobacteria.
TI  - Four new tetramic acid and one new furanone derivatives from the plant endophytic fungus Neopestalotiopsis sp.
AB  - Four new tetramic acid analogues neopestalotins A-D (1-4), one new furanone derivative neopestalotin E (6), and the known compound hymenosetin have been isolated from the solid cultures of the plant endophytic fungus Neopestalotiopsis sp. The structures of the new compounds were determined mainly by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments. The absolute configurations of 1 and 2 were assigned by circular dichroism (CD) data, whereas those of 3 and 4 were deduced by a combination of CD and heteronuclear long range coupling (HETLOC) data. Compound 2 showed modest antimicrobial activity against the Gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus col, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Crystal structure, complexation, spectroscopic characterization and antimicrobial evaluation of 3,4-dihydroxybenzylidene isonicotinyl-hydrazone.
AB  - A single crystal of 3,4-dihydroxybenzylidene isonicotinylhydrazone, HBINH, has been grown and solved by X-ray crystallography. The VO(2+), Zr(4+), Co(2+), Ni(2+), Cu(2+), Zn(2+), Cd(2+), Hg(2+) and Pd(2+) complexes of HBINH have been prepared and spectroscopically characterized. The data confirmed the formulae [Co(HBINH)(H2O)Cl]Cl.H2O, [Pd(HBINH)Cl2], [Zn(HBINH)2Cl2], [Cd(HBINH)(H2O)2Cl2].1(1/2)H2O, [(VO)2(HBINH-3H)(OH)(H2O)], [Ni2(HBINH)(H2O)6Cl2]Cl2, [Cu2(HBINH-3H)(H2O)2(OAc)].3H2O, [Zr2(HBINH-3H)Cl4]Cl, [Hg2(HBINH)Cl4] and the dimer {[Cu(HBINH)Cl]Cl}2. Most of the complexes have intense colors and high melting points and some are electrolytes in DMSO solution. The ligand behaves as a neutral bidentate in the Co(II), Cu(II), Pd(II), Zn(II) and Cd(II) complexes; dibasic tetradentate in [Ni2(HBINH)(H2O)6Cl2]Cl2 and tribasic tetradentate in [Cu2(HBINH-3H)(OAc)].5H2O, [(VO)2(HBINH-3H)(OH)(H2O)] and [Zr2(HBINH-3H)Cl4]Cl by the loss of 3H(+) due to the deprotonation of the two hydroxyl groups and the enolization of the amide (OCNH) group. A tetrahedral geometry was proposed for the Co(II), Cu(II), Zn(II) and Hg(II) complexes; square-planar for the Pd(II) complex; square-pyramid for the VO(2+) complex and octahedral for the Ni(II) and Cd(II) complexes. The complexes [Cd(HBINH)(H2O)2Cl2].1(1/2)H2O, [(VO)2(HBINH-3H)(OH)(H2O)] and [Cu2(HBINH-3H)-(H2O)2(OAc)].3H2O have activities against Bacillus sp. M3010, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Slamonella sp. PA393.
TI  - [Specific bacterial diversity in bats of different food guilds in Southern sierra Oaxaca, Mexico].
AB  - Specific bacterial diversity in bats of different food guilds in Southern sierra  Oaxaca, Mexico. Bats have different ecologic roles in variable ecosystems that have been already described. They have been linked to several zoonoses, however little is known about the relationship between bat microbiota and their diet, and studies on the bacterial ecology of the microbiota in bats are limited. To contribute with the description of this important interaction between microbiota and host, the aim of this work was to characterize the composition and bacterial diversity in the oral and anal regions of 10 species of bats, in relation to food guild. For this monthly samplings were conducted using four mist nets (19:00-24:00h) from February to October 2012; nets were reviewed every 45 minutes. Each captured organism was sampled in the oral and anal cavities with sterile swabs; these were placed in pre-enrichment media and stored at 4 degrees C. Bacterial samples were studied which through selective media, chromogenic and biochemical tests. We obtained samples from 502 frugivorous, 29 hematophagous and 11 nectivorous bats. We found a total of 26 bacterial species, with the predominant phylum Proteobacteria and the family Enterobacteriaceae. Statistically significant differences were observed between oral and anal microhabitats: frugivorous (t = -3.516, g.1 = 14.761, p = 0.003), hematophagous (t = -3.320, g.l = 19.262, p = 0.003), and nectivorous (t = -2.497, g.l = 11.933, p = 0.026), and in some guilds [frugivorous and nectivorous in the anal region (t = 2.274, g.l = 29.660, p = 0.030), hematophagous and nectivorous anal region (t = 2.077, g.l = 29.904, p = 0.049)]. It was also shown that there is bacteria specificity in some guilds such as nectivorous and frugivorous with Bacillus cereus, B. sp. X. sp., as well as, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermis, Aeromonas hydrophyla in hematophagous. Bacterial presence can be explained by the type of diet and/or by transfer of bacteria from their preys. These bacteria may be indigenous to these bats and play the role of mutual benefit, providing the host with stable growth conditions and supplemental nutrients, while the microbiota contributes to host nutrition, development of the immune system, stabilization of the microbial population and to avoid pathogens colonization. By understanding the importance of the relation- ship between host and its bacterial populations, the conservation efforts being made to protect species such as bats may be improved.
TI  - Spirotetronate antibiotics with anti-Clostridium activity from Actinomadura sp. 2EPS.
AB  - The rare actinomycetes strain 2EPS was isolated from soil and analysis of cultural, morphological characteristics, diaminopimelic acid content of its cell wall, and 16S rRNA gene sequence indicates that 2EPS belongs to genus Actinomadura. In addition, neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree also confirmed the relationships of this strain to other members of Actinomadura. A butanol extract with antibacterial activity was purified by reversed-phase chromatography to obtain three bioactive compounds, designated as compounds 1, 2 and 3. The structures of these compounds were determined using spectroscopic analysis ((1)H-NMR and (13)C-NMR) and mass spectrometric analysis (HR-TOF-MS). Compounds 1-3 were identified and found to be the same as those included in the Japanese patent number JP 09227587 for spirotetronate antibiotics and are BE-45722A (1), BE-45722B (2) and BE-45722C (3), respectively. All compounds were active against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579, and B. subtilis ATCC 6633) with low MIC values between 0.08 and 5.0 microg/ml. Moreover, both 1 and 3 also exhibited strong activity, with similar MIC values, against Clostridium perfringens S107 at 0.63 microg/ml and C. difficile 630 at 0.08 microg/ml. These results suggest the identified spirotetronate compounds may have potential in the treatment of Clostridium infections. Overall, this analysis demonstrates that rare actinomycetes are a promising source for discovery of antimicrobial compounds.
TI  - Bacillus polymachus sp. nov., with a broad range of antibacterial activity, isolated from forest topsoil samples by using a modified culture method.
AB  - A new, modified culture method that utilizes a transwell plate with a 0.4 microm  pore-size microporous membrane was developed. This system allows only trace nutrients from the soil into the liquid culture through the microporous membrane. The method is a more powerful tool for the discovery of novel species from soils than are traditional methods. Such newly identified species could potentially produce useful metabolites. A bacterial strain, T515(T), was isolated using this modified culture method. Growth of strain T515(T) occurred at pH 4-9 in a temperature range between 20 degrees C and 40 degrees C and in the presence of 0-2 % (w/v) NaCl on R2A agar. Colonies on the agar plates were tiny, white, and convex after 5 days incubation at 28 degrees C. Comparative analysis of the nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain T515(T) revealed close pairwise similarity with species of the genus Bacillus, and strain T515(T) was most closely related to Bacillus panaciterrae Gsoil 1517(T) (96.7 %) and Bacillus funiculus NAF001(T) (96.0 %). The major quinone of strain T515(T) was menaquinone-7 (MK-7) and the major fatty acids were iso-C15 : 0 (45.5 %), anteiso-C15 : 0 (23.2 %) and C16 : 0 (10.9 %). The predominant polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. Strain T515(T) was sensitive to streptomycin and tetracycline, but resistant to rifampicin (0.125 microg ml(-1)), ampicillin (0.5 microg ml(-1)) and chloramphenicol (1 microg ml(-1)). The strain showed antimicrobial activities against the six strains tested: Bacillus subtilis KEMB 51201-001, Staphylococcus aureus KEMB 4659, Pseudomonas aeruginosa KACC 10185, Staphylococcus epidermidis KACC 13234, Paenibacillus larvae KACC 14031 and Escherichia coli KEMB 212-234. Based on these results, strain T515(T) represents a novel species of the genus Bacillus with the proposed name, Bacillus polymachus sp. nov. The type strain is T515(T) ( = KEMB 9005-168(T) = KACC 18242(T) = NBRC 110614(T)).
TI  - Chemical composition of essential oil from ripe fruit of Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi and evaluation of its activity against wild strains of hospital origin.
AB  - The essential oil (EO) composition of ripe fruit of S. terebinthifolius Raddi was analyzed by GC-MS. The oil extraction yielded 6.54 +/- 1.06% (w/w). Seventeen compounds were identified, accounting for 91.15% of the total oil, where monoterpenes constituted the main chemical class (85.81%), followed by sesquiterpenes (5.34%). The major monoterpene identified was delta-3-carene (30.37%), followed by limonene (17.44%), alpha-phellandrene (12.60%) and alpha-pinene (12.59%). Trans-caryophyllene (1.77%) was the major sesquiterpene identified. The antibacterial activity of the essential oil was evaluated against wild strains of hospital origin (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp., Klebsiella oxytoca, Corynebacterium sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter sp., Enterobacter agglomerans, Bacillus sp., Nocardia sp. and Streptococcus group D). The essential oil of the ripe fruit of S. terebinthifolius Raddi has shown to be active against all tested wild strains, with minimum inhibitory concentration ranging from 3.55 mug/mL to 56.86 mug/mL. However, it has revealed some differences in susceptibility: the general, Gram-positive species showed greater sensitivity to the action of EO, which is probably due to the lower structural complexity of their cell walls.
TI  - Antibacterial and cytotoxic potential of silver nanoparticles synthesized using latex of Calotropis gigantea L.
AB  - The present study aimed to synthesis silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in a greener route using aqueous latex extract of Calotropis gigantea L. toward biomedical applications. Initially, synthesis of AgNPs was confirmed through UV-Vis spectroscopy which shows the surface plasmonic resonance peak (SPR) at 420 nm. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis provides clear evidence that protein fractions present in the latex extract act as reducing and stabilizing bio agents. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDAX) spectroscopy confirms the presence of silver as a major constituent element. X-ray diffractograms displays that the synthesized AgNPs were biphasic crystalline nature. Electron microscopic studies such as Field emission scanning electron microscopic (Fe-SEM) and Transmission electron microscope (TEM) reveals that synthesized AgNPs are spherical in shape with the size range between 5 and 30 nm. Further, crude latex aqueous extract and synthesized AgNPs were evaluated against different bacterial pathogens such as Bacillus cereus, Enterococci sp, Shigella sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Compared to the crude latex aqueous extract, biosynthesized AgNPs exhibits a remarkable antimicrobial activity. Likewise in vitro anticancer study manifests the cytotoxicity value of synthesized AgNPs against tested HeLa cells. The output of this study clearly suggesting that biosynthesized AgNPs using latex of C. gigantea can be used as promising nanomaterial for therapeutic application in context with nanodrug formulation.
TI  - Purification of a secreted lectin from Andrias davidianus skin and its antibacterial activity.
AB  - A lectin secreted from Andrias davidianus skin (ADL) was purified by affinity chromatography on porcine stomach mucin (type III) (PSM)-crosslinked albumin, followed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 and HPLC on TSK gel G3000PWXL. The purified lectin was found to be a dimeric protein, as revealed by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF analysis. SDS-PAGE showed that the ADL protein had a molecular mass of 17 kDa. ADL produced an 8.5 kDa band when examined using SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. ADL agglutinated native and trypsinized human B erythrocytes. The hemagglutination activity was inhibited by glycoproteins, such as PSM and asialo-PSM, but not by any of the monosaccharides tested. The activity was stable between 4 degrees C and 50 degrees C. Significant ADL activity was observed between pH 4-5. The lectin reaction did not depend on the presence of the divalent cation Ca2+ or Mg2+. The N-terminal ADL sequence was determined to be VGYTVGATPM. The lectin exhibited antibacterial activity, involving growth and respiration inhibition in Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Shewanella sp. Furthermore, ADL showed inhibition activity against the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These findings suggest that ADL plays an important role in the innate immunity of A. davidianus on the body surface.
TI  - Antibiotic oxylipins from Alternanthera brasiliana and its endophytic bacteria.
AB  - Bioassay-guided fractionation of Alternanthera brasiliana stem extracts resulted  in the isolation of an antibiotically active fraction. Five human pathogenic bacteria were used to guide the fractionation process for the isolation of antimicrobial compounds. Finally, 17 linoleate oxylipins were identified by LC-MS/MS and NMR spectroscopy. Five of the isolated compounds present in A. brasiliana tissues were also detected to be synthesized by endophytic bacteria of the genus Bacillus that were isolated from A. brasiliana. It is speculated that the antibiotic oxylipins from A. brasiliana might derive from bacteria and be involved in an ecological relationship between this plant and its endophytes.
TI  - Antibacterial secondary metabolites from an endophytic fungus, Eupenicillium sp.  LG41.
AB  - Two new compounds containing the decalin moiety, eupenicinicols A and B (1 and 2), two new sirenin derivatives, eupenicisirenins A and B (3 and 4), and four known compounds, (2S)-butylitaconic acid (5), (2S)-hexylitaconic acid (6), xanthomegnin (7), and viridicatumtoxin (8), were isolated from an endophytic fungus, Eupenicillium sp. LG41, harbored in the roots of the Chinese medicinal plant Xanthium sibiricum. Their structures were confirmed through combined spectroscopic analysis (NMR and HRMS(n)), and their absolute configurations were deduced by ECD calculations or optical rotation data. Since the endophytic fungus was isolated from the roots, the antibacterial efficacies of the compounds 1-6 were investigated against Bacillus subtilis and Acinetobacter sp. BD4, which typically inhabit soil, as well as the clinically important Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. (2S)-Butylitaconic acid (5) and (2S)-hexylitaconic acid (6) exhibited pronounced efficacy against Acinetobacter sp., corroborating the notion that root-endophytes provide chemical defense to the host plants. Compound 2 was highly active against the clinically relevant S. aureus. By comparing 1 with 2, it was revealed that altering the substitution at C-11 could drastically increase the antibacterial efficacy of 1. Our study reveals plausible ecological roles of the endophyte and its potential pharmaceutical use as a source of antibacterial compounds.
TI  - Wollamides: antimycobacterial cyclic hexapeptides from an Australian soil Streptomyces.
AB  - A soil Streptomyces nov. sp. (MST-115088) isolated from semiarid terrain near Wollogorang Station, Queensland, returned two known and two new examples of a rare class of cyclic hexapeptide, desotamides A and B (1 and 2) and E and F (3 and 4), respectively, together with two new d-Orn homologues, wollamides A and B (5 and 6). Structures were assigned by detailed spectroscopic and C3 Marfey's analysis. The desotamides/wollamides exhibit growth inhibitory activity against Gram-positive bacteria (IC50 0.6-7 muM) and are noncytotoxic to mammalian cells (IC50 >30 muM). The wollamides exhibit antimycobacterial activity (IC50 2.8 and 3.1 muM), including reduction in the intracellular mycobacterial survival in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages.
TI  - Microbiological quality of indoor air in university libraries.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the concentration of bacteria and fungi in the indoor environment of Jimma University libraries, so as to estimate the health hazard and to create standards for indoor air quality control. METHODS: The microbial quality of indoor air of eight libraries of Jimma University was determined. The settle plate method using open Petri-dishes containing different culture media was employed to collect sample twice daily. Isolates were identified according to standard methods. RESULTS: The concentrations of bacteria and fungi aerosols in the indoor environment of the university libraries ranged between 367-2595 CFU/m(3). According to the sanitary standards classification of European Commission, almost all the libraries indoor air of Jimma University was heavily contaminated with bacteria and fungi. In spite of their major source difference, the average fungi density found in the indoor air of libraries did appear to follow the same trend with bacterial density (P=0.001). The bacteria isolates included Micrococcus sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus sp. and Neisseria sp. while Cladosporium sp., Alternaria sp., Penicillium sp. and Aspergillus sp. were the most isolated fungi. CONCLUSIONS: The indoor air of all libraries were in the range above highly contaminated according to European Commission classification and the most isolates are considered as potential candidates involved in the establishment of sick building syndromes and often associated with clinical manifestations like allergy, rhinitis, asthma and conjunctivitis. Thus, attention must be given to control those environmental factors which favor the growth and multiplication of microbes in indoor environment of libraries to safeguard the health of users and workers.
TI  - Anti-biofilm activity of biogenic selenium nanoparticles and selenium dioxide against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the anti-biofilm activity of biologically synthesized selenium nanoparticles (Se NPs) against the biofilm produced by clinically isolated bacterial strains compared to that of selenium dioxide. Thirty strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis were isolated from various specimens of the patients hospitalized in different hospitals (Kerman, Iran). Quantification of the biofilm using microtiter plate assay method introduced 30% of S. aureus, 13% of P. aeruginosa and 17% of P. mirabilis isolates as severely adherent strains. Transmission electron micrograph (TEM) of the purified Se NPs (produced by Bacillus sp. MSh-1) showed individual and spherical nano-structure in the size range of 80-220nm. Obtained results of the biofilm formation revealed that selenium nanoparticles inhibited the biofilm of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and P. mirabilis by 42%, 34.3%, and 53.4%, respectively, compared to that of the non-treated samples. Effect of temperature and pH on the biofilm formation in the presence of Se NPs and SeO2 was also evaluated.
TI  - Novel 1,5,7-trihydroxy-3-hydroxy methyl anthraquinone isolated from terrestrial Streptomyces sp. (eri-26) with antimicrobial and molecular docking studies.
AB  - Streptomyces sp. isolate ERI-26 was obtained from the Nilgiris forest soil of Western Ghats, Tamil Nadu, India. Novel anthraquinone compound was isolated from the active fraction 5; it was identified by spectroscopical data using UV, IR, NMR and MASS. The isolated compound 1,5,7-trihydroxy-3-hydroxy methyl anthraquinone was tested against bacteria and fungi at minimum inhibitory concentration level. The compound showed significant antimicrobial activity against bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus at 125 mug/ml, Staphylococcus epidermidis at 62.5 mug/m, Bacillus subtilis at 31.25 mug/ml, fungi; Epidermophyton floccosum at 62.5 mug/ml, Aspergillus niger at 31.25 mug/ml, Aspergiller flavus at 31.25 mug/ml, Trichophyton rubrum at 62.5 mug/ml and Botrytis cinerea at 62.5 mug/ml. The isolated compound was subjected to molecular docking studies for the inhibition of TtgR, topoisomerase IV and AmpC beta-lactamase enzymes which are targets for antimicrobials. Docking studies of the compound showed low docking energy indicating its usefulness as antimicrobial agent. 1,5,7-Trihydroxy-3-hydroxy methyl anthraquinone is new, and its antimicrobial and molecular docking properties are reported for the first time.
TI  - The blow fly, Chrysomya megacephala, and the house fly, Musca domestica, as mechanical vectors of pathogenic bacteria in Northeast Thailand.
AB  - The Oriental latrine fly, Chrysomya megacephala (Fabricius) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) and the house fly, Musca domestica L., (Diptera: Muscidae) are synanthropic flies which are adapted to live in close association with human habitations, thereby making them likely mechanical vectors of several pathogens to humans. There were two main aims of this study. The first aim was to determine the prevalence of these two fly species from five types of human habitations including: fresh-food markets, garbage piles, restaurants, school cafeterias and paddy fields, in the Muang Ubon Ratchathani and Warinchamrap districts of Ubon Ratchathani province of Northeast Thailand. Flies collection were conducted monthly from September 2010-October 2011 using a reconstructable funnel trap, containing 1 day-tainted beef offal as bait. A total of 7 750 flies (6 401 C. megacephala and 1 349 M.domestica) were collected. The second aim was to examine the potential of these flies to carry pathogenic bacteria. Bacteria were isolated from 994 individual flies collected using a sweep net (555 C. megacephala and 439 M. domestica). A total of 15 bacterial genera were isolated from the external surfaces, comprising ten genera of gram-negative bacteria and five gram-positive bacteria. The most common bacteria isolated from both species were coagulase-negative staphylococci, followed by Streptococcus group D non-enterococci. Human pathogenic enteric bacteria isolated were Salmonella sp., Shigella sp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhi, Bacillus sp., and Enterococcus sp., of which S. typhi is the first report of isolation from these fly species. Other human pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Not only were the number of C. megacephala positive for bacteria significantly higher than for M. domestica, but they were also carrying ~11-12 times greater bacterial load than M. domestica. These data suggest that both fly species should be considered potential mechanical vectors of bacterial pathogens associated with human habitations year-round in this region of Northeast Thailand.
TI  - Penialidins A-C with strong antibacterial activities from Penicillium sp., an endophytic fungus harboring leaves of Garcinia nobilis.
AB  - Three new polyketides named penialidins A-C (1-3), along with one known compound, citromycetin (4), were isolated from an endophytic fungus, Penicillium sp., harbored in the leaves of the Cameroonian medicinal plant Garcinia nobilis. Their structures were elucidated by means of spectroscopic and spectrometric methods (NMR and HRMS(n)). The antibacterial efficacies of the new compounds (1-3) were tested against the clinically-important risk group 2 (RG2) bacterial strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The ecologically imposing strains of E. coli (RG1), Bacillus subtilis and Acinetobacter sp. BD4 were also included in the assay. Compound 3 exhibited pronounced activity against the clinically-relevant S. aureus as well as against B. subtilis comparable to that of the reference standard (streptomycin). Compound 2 was also highly-active against S. aureus. By comparing the structures of the three new compounds (1-3), it was revealed that altering the substitutions at C-10 and C-2 can significantly increase the antibacterial activity of 1.
TI  - Cytotoxic and Antibacterial Quinone Sesquiterpenes from a Myrothecium Fungus.
AB  - Six new quinone sesquiterpenes, myrothecols A-F (1-6), and hymenopsin B (7) were  isolated from cultures of Myrothecium sp. SC0265 by bioassay-guided fractionation. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR and MS data. The absolute configurations of the new compounds were assigned by CD/TDDFT calculations, and that of and hymenopsin B was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. Compounds 1-5 and hymenopsin demonstrated cytotoxic activity against human carcinoma A549, HeLa, and HepG2 cells. Compounds 1-5 also exhibited antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus.
TI  - Composition, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of methanol extracts of some Acinos Miller species.
AB  - GC and GC/MS analyses of the methanol extracts obtained from the aerial parts of  six Acinos Miller species from Serbia and Montenegro were performed. Seventy-four constituents, accounting for 84.9-99.0% of the total composition of the extracts, were identified. The common feature of the A. suaveolens, A. majoranifolius and A. alpinus methanol extracts was the high content of monoterpenes, while the common feature of the A. graveolens, A. arvensis and A. hungaricus methanol extracts was the prevalence of sesquiterpenes. The total flavonoids, polyphenols and tannins content, as well as antioxidant activity (FRAP and DPPH assay) of the methanolic extracts were investigated. The highest antioxidant activity was observed in the extract of A. alpinus which had high levels of all polyphenol classes examined. A disk diffusion method was used for the evaluation of the antimicrobial activities of the extracts against a panel of microorganisms (bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium pyogenes, Enterococcus sp., Micrococcus flavus, Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis and Escherichia coli; fungi: Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The preliminary bioassay results indicated that the methanol extract of A. alpinus could be a possible source of antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds.
TI  - In-vitro assessment of antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of methanol extracts and essential oil of Thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Owing to the complexity of the antioxidant materials and their mechanism of actions, it is obvious that no single testing method is capable of providing a comprehensive picture of the antioxidant profile. The essential oil of the Thymus specie may still possess other important activities in traditional medicine, it can be used in the treatment of fever and cough. This essential oil may also have an anticancer activity. METHODS: The essential oils aerial parts hydrodistilled from Thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis, were characterised by GC/MS analysis and the methanolic extracts were chemically characterized by HPLC method. The essence of thyme was evaluated for its antioxidant and antibacterial activity. RESULT: The Terpinen-4-ol are the principal class of metabolites (33.34%) among which 1.8-cineole (19.96%) and camphor (19.20%) predominate. In this study, quantitative values of antioxidant activity of crude methanolic extracts of Thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis were investigated. The essential oils was screened for their antibacterial activity against six common pathogenic microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteridis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Listeria monocytogenes) by well diffusion method and agar dilution method (MIC). All the essences were found to inhibit the growth of both gram (+) and gram (-) bacteria organisms tested. These activities were correlated with the presence of phenolic compounds in active fractions. HPLC confirmed presence of phenolic compounds in methanol extracts. CONCLUSION: Methanol extracts and essential oils from aerial parts of Thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis, were examined for their potential as antioxidants. The technique for measuring antioxidant activity, which was developed using DPPH, ABTS and beta-carotene bleaching, produced results as found in established literatures. The present results indicate clearly that methanol extracts and essential oils from Thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis possess antioxidant properties and could serve as free radical inhibitors or scavengers, acting possibly as primary antioxidants, also their essential oil have an antibacterial effect.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a novel lipopeptide from Streptomyces amritsarensis sp. nov. active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Nowadays antimicrobial lipopeptides are being widely exploited for developing potential therapeutic agents for treating bacterial infections. In the present study, we have purified and characterized an antimicrobial lipopeptide produced by Streptomyces amritsarensis sp. nov. (= MTCC 11845(T) = JCM 19660(T)). The lipopeptide was purified using silica gel chromatography, size exclusion chromatography and reverse phase- HPLC. The MS/MS analysis of the lipopeptide revealed that it has amino acid sequence as Ala-Thr-Gly-Ser-His-Gln and a long chain fatty acid tail with six times repeated the molecular mass of 161 Da which is corresponding to -C12H19. Based on the molecular mass (878.5 Da) and amino acid composition, the lipopeptide was identified as a novel lipopeptide. The MIC values of purified lipopeptide against Bacillus subtilis (MTCC 619), Staphylococcus epidermidis (MTCC 435), Mycobacterium smegmatis (MTCC 6) and clinical strain, Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were found to be 10, 15, 25 and 45 mug/ml, respectively. It was completely stable at 70 degrees C for 1 h and retained 81.8% activity after autoclaving (121 degrees C for 15 min). It did not show any change in its activity profile between pH 5.0 - 9.0 and is stable to trypsin, proteinase K and lipase enzymes. It was found to be non-mutagenic against Salmonella typhimurium (TA98) and did not show cytotoxicity when checked against Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. In addition to antibacterial activity it also exhibits biosurfactant activity.
TI  - Antibacterial Activity of Murrayaquinone A and 6-Methoxy-3,7-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-carbazole-1,4(9H)-dione.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of Murrayaquinone A (10), a naturally occurring carbazoloquinone alkaloid, and 6-methoxy-3,7-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-carbazole-1,4(9H)-dione (11), a synthetic carbazoloquinone, both obtained during the development of the synthesis of Carbazomycin G, having unique quinone moiety, was studied against Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas sp.) bacteria. Compound 10 showed antibacterial activities against both of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus whereas compound 11 indicated the activity against Staphylococcus aureus only. Both compounds 10 and 11 exhibited minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 50 mu g mL(-1) against Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activity of Haliclona sp. from the Persian Gulf, Iran.
AB  - In this study, antifungal and antibacterial activities of diethyl ether, methanol and aqueous extracts of Haliclona sp. were assessed (in vitro). The antibacterial activity of the extracts was determined by broth dilution methods against clinical Gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gram-positive bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus aureus, Bacillus subtilis spizizenii. The antifungal activity of the extracts was determined by using a broth microdilution test against clinical fungi Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus. Our results showed diethyl ether extract of Haliclona sp. was active on Gram-positive bacteria. In addition, methanol extract in comparison with diethyl ether extract had better activity against C. albicans (MIC: 0.75 mg/mL, MFC: 1.5mg/mL) and A. fumigatus (MIC: 2mg/mL, MFC: 3mg/mL). Aqueous extract had neither antifungal nor antibacterial activities. Based our results, Haliclona sp. can be considered as a source of novel antibiotic and antifungal.
TI  - Biosynthesis, characterization and antimicrobial activity of silver nanoparticles by Streptomyces sp. SS2.
AB  - In the present study the microbial biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) by secondary metabolites of Streptomyces sp. SS2 in an eco-friendly approach has been reported. The Streptomyces sp. SS2 was isolated from the soil sediment of Similipal Biosphere Reserve. The identification of this strain was determined by phenotypical characteristics (morphological and biochemical) and molecular characterization method using 16 s rDNA sequencing. The morphological study was also done by high-resolution scanning electron microscopy. The preliminary characterization of biosynthesized silver nanoparticle was carried out using UV-Vis spectrum analysis, which showed an absorption peak at 420 nm corresponding to plasmon absorption of silver. The average size and charge (zeta potential) of the particles were found to be 67.95 +/- 18.52 nm and -17.7 +/- 5.30 mV, respectively. The functional groups were identified by FTIR studies and their morphology (round and spherical shape) was determined by scanning electron microscopy. The synthesized AgNPs exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (MTCC 1089), Bacillus subtilis (MTCC 7164), Staphylococcus epidermis (MTCC 3615), Vibrio cholerae (MTCC 3904) and Staphylococcus aureus (MTCC 1144). These biotechnological approaches of synthesis of nanoparticles can direct a new path in biomaterial sciences and enrich biomedical applications.
TI  - Undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase inhibitors: antibacterial drug leads.
AB  - There is a significant need for new antibiotics due to the rise in drug resistance. Drugs such as methicillin and vancomycin target bacterial cell wall biosynthesis, but methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) have now arisen and are of major concern. Inhibitors acting on new targets in cell wall biosynthesis are thus of particular interest since they might also restore sensitivity to existing drugs, and the cis-prenyl transferase undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase (UPPS), essential for lipid I, lipid II, and thus, peptidoglycan biosynthesis, is one such target. We used 12 UPPS crystal structures to validate virtual screening models and then assayed 100 virtual hits (from 450,000 compounds) against UPPS from S. aureus and Escherichia coli. The most promising inhibitors (IC50 approximately 2 muM, Ki approximately 300 nM) had activity against MRSA, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus anthracis, and a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus sp. with MIC or IC50 values in the 0.25-4 mug/mL range. Moreover, one compound (1), a rhodanine with close structural similarity to the commercial diabetes drug epalrestat, exhibited good activity as well as a fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) of 0.1 with methicillin against the community-acquired MRSA USA300 strain, indicating strong synergism.
TI  - Poultry farm hygiene: microbiological quality assessment of drinking water used in layer chickens managed under the battery cage and deep litter systems at three poultry farms in southwestern Nigeria.
AB  - Water troughs from deep litter and caged chicken water troughs (drinkers) fixed to each of the different 3-tier cages containing layer chickens in Farms A, B and C were subjected to a 7-day study which involved the monitoring of poultry farm hygiene. Drinkers were washed before filling with water on Day 1. For Days 3, 5 and 7 water was served without prior washing. The occurrence and characterization of the bacteria isolates were investigated and data obtained were analyzed and compared. For the bacterial count on Day 1, for layer chickens on cage system, no significant differences (p > 0.05) among the farms and between the farms tier interactions. On Day 3, no significant difference (p > 0.05) among the parameters. On Day 5, there was significant difference (p<0.05) among the farms and on Day 7, there was high significant difference (p < 0.01) among the farms. On Days 5 and 7, there were no significant differences (p>0.05) among the tiers nor between the interactions of the farms and tiers. The bacterial count in water troughs of layer chickens in deep litter system, on Day 1, had no significant differences (p > 0.05) between the farms, water troughs and their interactions. On Day 3, no significant difference (p > 0.05) among the parameters. On Days 5 and 7, there were significant difference (p<0.05) and a high significant difference (p < 0.01) between the farms respectively. On Days 5 and 7, no significant differences between the water troughs and between the interaction of the farms and the water troughs. Farm A isolates contained Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermis, Klebsiella sp., Salmonella sp., Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus salivarius and Corynebacterium sp. Farm B had Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermis, Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium sp., Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis and Klebsiella sp. while for Farm C, apart from the prevalent bacteria isolates obtained in Farms A and B, additional 2 bacterial isolates, Lactobacillus salivarius and Pseudomonas aeuriginosa were found. In conclusion, water troughs when cleaned on daily basis carry minimum bacterial load. Those left for 3, 5 and 7 days uncleaned had progressively high bacterial loads, suggesting that the flock of birds and the consumers of the eggs and meat from the chickens are at risk of bacterial infection unless strict farm hygiene is ensured through regular monitoring.
TI  - Activity of Kaempferia pandurata (Roxb.) rhizome ethanol extract against MRSA, MRCNS, MSSA, Bacillus subtilis and Salmonella typhi.
AB  - Temu kunci (Kaempferia pandurata (Roxb.)) has a number of benefits and one of these is antibacterial. The rhizome is said to have antibacterial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Lactocillus sp. and Candida albicans. The aim of the study is to test the antibacterial activity of Kaempferia pandurata (Roxb.) rhizome ethanol extract on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant coagulase negative Staphylococci (MRCNS), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Bacillus subtilis and Salmonella typhi. Antimicrobial activity of the extract was assayed by the microdilution method using Mueller Hinton Broth with sterilized 96 round-bottomed microwells to determine the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) as well as to determine the time-kill activity. The MIC of the extract was 16 ppm for both Bacillus subtilis and MRSA; 8 ppm for both MSSA and Salmonella typhi and 4 ppm for MRCNS. Ethanol extract of Kaempferia pandurata (Roxb.) showed antibacterial activity against all the tested bacteria and was the most potent against MRCNS, with MIC 4 ppm. The killing profile test of the extract displayed bactericidal activity at 8-16 ppm against MRSA, MSSA, Bacillus subtilis and Salmonella typhi and bacteriostatic activity at 4 ppm towards MRCNS.
TI  - Helvolic acid, an antibacterial nortriterpenoid from a fungal endophyte, sp. of orchid endemic to Sri Lanka.
AB  - An endophytic fungus was isolated from surface sterilized leaf segments of Anoectochilus setaceus, an orchid endemic to Sri Lanka, and was identified as Xylaria sp. by morphological characters and DNA sequencing. Bioassay-guided chromatographic fractionation of the organic extract of a laboratory culture of this fungus led to the isolation of the known antibacterial helvolic acid. Helvolic acid was active against the Gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus subtilis [minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC), 2 mug mL-1] and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC, 4 mug mL-1).
TI  - [Epidemiological investigation in five dental offices of the Clinic of Dentistry, Faculty of Medicine, Palacky University, Olomouc and of the Olomouc University Hospital].
AB  - The aim of this epidemiological investigation was to determine microbial contamination of surfaces, medical devices, and equipment in five outpatient dental offices of the Clinic of Dentistry, Faculty of Medicine, Palacky University, Olomouc and of the Olomouc University Hospital. The epidemiological investigation was carried out as a one-time detection of microbial contamination from selected at risk sites on the dental unit with chair and in its immediate surroundings that had been sampled before the staff and patients arrived in the morning. The rates of culture-negative results ranged from 6.0 % in the children's dental office to 17.3 % in the dental prosthetics office. No statistically significant difference in these rates was found between different types of dental offices. The most commonly identified microorganisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci and Bacillus sp. Pseudomonas aeruginosa often reported to be the cause of hospital infection was isolated from the spit-toon drain in most of the cases. No methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was cultured from the swabs. We believe that the microorganisms isolated from the at risk sites are indoor airborne pathogens initially present in aerosols and then deposited on surfaces during the time after working hours. KEYWORDS: dental office - bioaersol - contamination of surfaces - infectious agent.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial metabolites from an endophytic Aspergillus sp. associated with Melia azedarach.
AB  - Seven known metabolites, dianhydro-aurasperone C (1), isoaurasperone A (2), fonsecinone A (3), asperpyrone A (4), asperazine (5), rubrofusarin B (6) and (R)-3-hydroxybutanonitrile (7), were isolated from the culture of Aspergillus sp. KJ-9, a fungal endophyte isolated from Melia azedarach and identified by spectroscopic methods. All isolates were evaluated in vitro against several phytopathogenic fungi (Gibberella saubinetti, Magnaporthe grisea, Botrytis cinerea, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Alternaria solani) and pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Staphyloccocus aureus and Bacillus cereus). Compounds 3 and 7 were active against almost all phytopathogenic fungi tested with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) range of 6.25-50 muM. Moreover, compound 3 was active against all pathogenic bacteria with MIC in the range of 25-100 muM. Compound 7 is a rare new natural product isolated from a natural source for the first time, and the detailed NMR data of 1 were first assigned.
TI  - Isolation and diversity of natural product biosynthetic genes of cultivable bacteria associated with marine sponge Mycale sp. from the coast of Fujian, China.
AB  - The marine sponge Mycale sp., a potential source of natural bioactive products, is widely distributed along the coast of Fujian, China. The cultivable bacterial community associated with Mycale sp., the antibacterial activities, and the PKS (polyketide synthase) and NRPS (nonribosomal peptide synthetase) gene diversity of these bacteria were investigated. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene showed that the 51 isolates from Mycale sp. belonged to Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Firmicutes. Among them, some bacteria were first isolated from marine sponge. The 20 isolates with antimicrobial activities were primarily clustered within the groups Actinobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Bacillus. Strain HNS054, which showed 99% similarity to Streptomyces labedae, exhibited the strongest antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 1430, Bacillus subtilis MTCC 441) and Vibrio species. The screening of natural product biosynthetic genes revealed that 8 Actinobacteria species with antimicrobial activities possessed PKS-KS (ketosynthase) or NRPS-A domains, and the Nocardiopsis species contained a hybrid or mixed PKS-NRPS system. The phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences indicated that the identified KS domains clustered with those from diverse bacterial groups, including Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, and Firmicutes. Most KS domain sequences had high homology (>80%) to type I KSs, but the KS domain of Nocardiopsis sp. strain HNS048 had 77% similarity to the type II KS domain of Burkholderia gladioli. The NRPS-A domains of the 8 isolates were grouped into the Gammaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes groups. The NRPS-A gene of strain HNS052, identified as Nocardiopsis cyriacigeorgica, showed only 54% similarity to Rhodococcus opacus. All results suggested that Mycale sp. harboured diverse bacteria that could contribute to the production of novel bioactive substances in the future.
TI  - Antioxidant and antimicrobial potential of the Bifurcaria bifurcata epiphytic bacteria.
AB  - Surface-associated marine bacteria are an interesting source of new secondary metabolites. The aim of this study was the isolation and identification of epiphytic bacteria from the marine brown alga, Bifurcaria bifurcata, and the evaluation of the antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of bacteria extracts. The identification of epiphytic bacteria was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Bacteria extracts were obtained with methanol and dichloromethane (1:1) extraction. The antioxidant activity of extracts was performed by quantification of total phenolic content (TPC), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). Antimicrobial activities were evaluated against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans. A total of 39 Bifurcaria bifurcata-associated bacteria were isolated and 33 were identified as Vibrio sp. (48.72%), Alteromonas sp. (12.82%), Shewanella sp. (12.26%), Serratia sp. (2.56%), Citricoccus sp. (2.56%), Cellulophaga sp. (2.56%), Ruegeria sp. (2.56%) and Staphylococcus sp. (2.56%). Six (15.38%) of the 39 bacteria Bifurcaria bifurcata-associated bacteria presented less than a 90% Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) match, and some of those could be new. The highest antioxidant activity and antimicrobial activity (against B. subtilis) was exhibited by strain 16 (Shewanella sp.). Several strains also presented high antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, mainly belonging to Alteromonas sp. and Vibrio sp. There were no positive results against fungi and Gram-negative bacteria. Bifurcaria bifurcata epiphytic bacteria were revealed to be excellent sources of natural antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds.
TI  - Genomics-guided discovery of endophenazines from Kitasatospora sp. HKI 714.
AB  - In this study we report on the genomics-guided exploration of the metabolic potential of the newly discovered strain Kitasatospora sp. HKI 714. The bioinformatics analysis of the whole genome sequence revealed the presence of a biosynthetic gene cluster presumably responsible for the biosynthesis of formerly unknown endophenazine derivatives. A 200 L cultivation combined with bioactivity-guided isolation techniques revealed four new natural products belonging to the endophenazines and the 5,10-dihydrophenazines. Detailed descriptions of their biological effects, mainly focused on antimicrobial properties against several mycobacteria, are given.
TI  - Campechic acids A and B: anti-invasive polyether polyketides from a soil-derived  Streptomyces.
AB  - Campechic acids A (1) and B (2), two new polyketides, were isolated from the culture extract of Streptomyces sp., and their structures were determined by NMR and MS spectroscopic analysis. Campechic acids are polyether-polyketides functionalized by two tetrahydrofuran rings, an enolized 1,3-diketone, and multiple methyl substitutions. Absolute configuration of nine stereogenic centers in 1, except for four chiral centers in the cyclic ether moieties, was determined by the 1H NMR anisotropy method in combination with chemical degradation. Campechic acids exhibited potent inhibitory effects on tumor cell invasion with IC50 values in the nanomolar to submicromolar range.
TI  - Modification of Fatty acids in membranes of bacteria: implication for an adaptive mechanism to the toxicity of carbon nanotubes.
AB  - We explored whether bacteria could respond adaptively to the presence of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by investigating the influence of CNTs on the viability, composition of fatty acids, and cytoplasmic membrane fluidity of bacteria in aqueous medium for 24 h exposure. The CNTs included long single-walled carbon nanotubes (L-SWCNTs), short single-walled carbon nanotubes (S-SWCNTs), short carboxyl single-walled carbon nanotubes (S-SWCNT-COOH), and aligned multiwalled carbon nanotubes (A-MWCNTs). The bacteria included three common model bacteria, Staphyloccocus aureus (Gram-positive), Bacillus subtilis (Gram-positive), and Escherichia coli (Gram-negative), and one polybrominated diphenyl ether degrading strain, Ochrobactrum sp. (Gram-negative). Generally, L-SWCNTs were the most toxic to bacteria, whereas S-SWCNT-COOH showed the mildest bacterial toxicity. Ochrobactrum sp. was more susceptible to the toxic effect of CNTs than E. coli. Compared to the control in the absence of CNTs, the viability of Ochrobactrum sp. decreased from 71.6-81.4% to 41.8-70.2%, and E. coli from 93.7-104.0% to 67.7-91.0% when CNT concentration increased from 10 to 50 mg L(-1). The cytoplasmic membrane fluidity of bacteria increased with CNT concentration, and a significant negative correlation existed between the bacterial viabilities and membrane fluidity for E. coli and Ochrobactrum sp. (p < 0.05), indicating that the increase in membrane fluidity induced by CNTs was an important factor causing the inactivation of bacteria. In the presence of CNTs, E. coli and Ochrobactrum sp. showed elevation in the level of saturated fatty acids accompanied with reduction in unsaturated fatty acids, compensating for the fluidizing effect of CNTs. This demonstrated that bacteria could modify their composition of fatty acids to adapt to the toxicity of CNTs. In contrast, S. aureus and B. subtilis exposed to CNTs increased the proportion of branched-chain fatty acids and decreased the level of straight-chain fatty acids, which was also favorable to counteract the toxic effect of CNTs. This study suggests that the bacterial tolerances to CNTs are associated with both the adaptive modification of fatty acids in the membrane and the physicochemical properties of CNTs. This is the first report about the physiologically adaptive response of bacteria to CNTs, and may help to further understand the ecotoxicological effects of CNTs.
TI  - Spiromastixones A-O, antibacterial chlorodepsidones from a deep-sea-derived Spiromastix sp. fungus.
AB  - Fifteen new depsidone-based analogues named spiromastixones A-O (1-15) were isolated from the fermentation broth of a deep-sea Spiromastix sp. fungus. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of extensive NMR and mass spectroscopic analysis in association with chemical conversion. Spiromastixones A-O are classified into two subtypes based on the orientation of ring C relative to ring A, while the n-propyl substituents on rings A and C are rarely seen in natural products. Most analogues are substituted by various numbers of chlorine atoms. All compounds exhibited significant inhibition against Gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus thuringiensis, and Bacillus subtilis with MIC values ranging from 0.125 to 8.0 mug/mL. In addition, compounds 6-10 displayed potent inhibitory effects against methicillin-resistant bacterial strains of S. aureus (MRSA) and S. epidermidis (MRSE), while 10 also inhibited the growth of the vancomycin-resistant bacteria Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium (VRE). The structure-activity relationships are discussed.
TI  - Heronamides D-F, polyketide macrolactams from the deep-sea-derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 03032.
AB  - Three new macrolactams, heronamides D-F (1-3), were isolated from the deep-sea-derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 03032 upon changing cultivation conditions. The planar structures of heronamides D-F (1-3) were elucidated by extensive MS and NMR spectroscopic analyses and comparisons with the closely related heronamides A-C. The relative configurations of 1-3 were deduced by detailed analysis of (3)JHH values and NOESY data. The absolute configurations of 1 and 2 were determined by chemical modifications and application of the modified Mosher's method. None of the compounds exhibited obvious antimicrobial or cytotoxic activities.
TI  - Multiplex PCR (polymerase chain reaction) assay for detection of E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella sp., Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio parahaemolyticus in spiked shrimps (Penaeus monodon).
AB  - The coastal aquaculture mainly shrimps constitute major export sector in Bangladesh and is increasingly shaped by international trade conditions and by national responses to those stringent quality and safety standards. PCR based validated methods for detection of major bacterial pathogens in shrimp might be very useful tool for ensuring quality and safety standards of exportable shrimps. The objective of this study was to evaluate overall performance (sensitivity and specificity) of the multiplex PCR assay for detection of Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Salmonella sp. and Escherichia coli O157:H7 from spiked shrimp samples. The targeted genes were ompW for V. cholerae, tdh for V. parahaemolyticus, sefA for Salmonella spp. and hlyEHEC for E. coli O157:H7. The genomic DNA was extracted by using standard method and amplified accordingly. Sensitivity of the assay was tested by inoculating the shrimp homogenate with viable cells of laboratory references strains (target pathogens). The genes were amplified individually both from culture homogenate and spiked samples. Twenty different uniplex and multiplex PCR assay were performed; the results showed that the sensitivity and specificity of multiplex PCR are comparable to that of the results of uniplex PCR for the samples. DNA extracted from shrimp samples spiked with non-target pathogen (Bacillus cereus, Shigella flexneri and Staphylococcus aureus) yielded negative results.
TI  - Structure-activity relationships of 3,3'-phenylmethylene-bis-4-hydroxycoumarins:  selective and potent inhibitors of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Dicoumarols and coumarin derivatives have shown a variety of pharmaceutical activities and have been found to be potent inhibitor for the NAD(P)H-dependent flavoproteins. In this report, dicoumarol and its derivatives containing the substituted benzene ring at the methylenebis position were synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, and gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli and Klebsiella sp. The results showed that the synthesized dicoumarols affect cell growth but are selective against gram-positive over gram-negative bacterial cells. However, for most derivatives, the substitution of steric bulky benzene group on the methylenebis position appears to decrease in the efficacy of antibacterial effect. This finding is roughly described by the predicted poorer docked structure of the derivatives to a homology model of S. aureus flavoprotein. 3D-QSAR study highlighted structural features around the substituted benzene ring of dicoumarols as the antibacterial activity. CoMFA and CoMSIA contour maps support the idea that steric repulsion at the para position could diminish the antibacterial activity. The results of this study provide a better understanding of the molecular basis for the antibacterial activity of dicoumarols.
TI  - Potentialities of newly isolated Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus sp for curd  preparation and a comparative study of its physico-chemical parameters with other marketed curds.
AB  - Two Bacillus sp. were isolated from the local fermented milk and identified on the basis 16S rRNA sequence profile as Bacillus subtilis AKL1 and by biochemical process as Lactobacillus acidophilus AKL2. These isolates were used as fresh inoculums for curd preparation individually and in combinations. Different physico-chemical and therapeutic properties of the newly prepared curd were examined and compared with marketed local (sweet and sour) and branded (Mother Dairy and Thackar) curds. The total hydrolyzed peptides, free amino acids, lactic acid were significantly higher, whereas, total solid, ash content, syneresis and free reducing sugar were lower in the curd prepared by a mixture of AKL1 and AKL2 (0.5:0.5, v/v). The antioxidant activity against ABTS+, DPPH8, OH* and Fe3+ were also higher in the newly formulated curd. Polyphenols (85.5 microg/g), flavonoids (12.5 microg/g) and free aromatic amino acids contents were also higher in AKL1+AKL2. All these components prevent excess protein oxidation that was revealed by SDS-PAGE. The curd also exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against some entero-pathogens like Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Shigella dysentery, Vibrio cholerae and Staphylococcus aureus. It can be concluded that the combination of these Lactobacillus sp. will be a fruitful inoculum for the preparation of curd having better health promoting effects.

CY05 and Pseudomonas putida CY06 respectively. P. protegens CY01 and P. chlororaphis CY02 have antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtillis and Staphylococcus aureus. P. chlororaphis CY02 has antagonistic activity against Pyricularia oryzae and anti-tumor cell activity against mouse melanoma B16 cells. CONCLUSION: The isolated P. chlororaphis CY02 has a significant effect on pathogenic bacteria, Pyricularia oryzae and tumor cells.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of some Euphorbia species.
AB  - In this study, the antimicrobial activities of methanolic extracts and latex of some Euphorbia species used for medical purposes in Turkey were investigated. The extracts of Euphorbia aleppica L., Euphorbia szovitsii Fisch.&Mey. var. harputensis Aznav. ex M. S. Khan, Euphorbia falcata L. sub. falcata var. falcata, Euphorbia denticulata Lam., Euphorbia macroclada Boiss., Euphorbia cheiradenia Boiss.&Hohen, Euphorbia virgata Waldst.&Kit., Euphorbia petiolata Banks&Sol. were prepared with methanol. The antimicrobial activities of these extracts were examined on test microorganisms as follows: Staphylococcus aureus COWAN 1, Bacillus megaterium DSM 32, Proteus vulgaris FMC 1, Klebsiella pneumonia FMC 5, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa DSM 50071, Candida albicans FMC 17, Candida glabrata ATCC 66032, Epidermophyton sp. and Trichophyton sp. by the disc diffusion methods and well agar method. The MIC values of extracts were determined according to the broth microdulitions method. Results indicated that extracts of Euphorbia species inhibited the growth of tested microorganisms in the different ratio. Also, the MIC values of extracts were determined as 31,2-1000 microg.
TI  - Exopolymers from Tolypothrix tenuis and three Anabaena sp. (Cyanobacteriaceae) as novel blood clotting agents for wound management.
AB  - Rapid initiation of clotting is critical to trauma patients. In the present study exopolymers (EPs) from four desert cyanobacteria including Tolypothrix tenuis and three species of Anabaena have been discovered as potential hemostatic biomaterials. The EPs showed reduction in activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT) by 16-41% and 12-65%, respectively. Besides hastening blood clotting, the EPs could absorb 7.1-25.9 g H(2)O g(-1) EP and displayed 7.1-18.1% hydrophobicity. They were noncytotoxic and biodegradable. The EP from Anabaena sp. showed strong antibacterial activity against E. coli, S. aureus and B. licheniformis. These results suggest that cyanobacteria, the microscopic phototrophs growing rapidly over simple mineral medium could prove to be a novel source of affordable hemostatic dressings for the traumatic wounds in underdeveloped and developing countries. Compositional analysis of the EPs showed them to be consisting of mainly carbohydrate (17-50%), protein (4.4-7.2%), uronic acid (4.7-9.5%) and sulphate (0.6-6.6%). Their viscometric molecular weight ranged from 539 to 3679 kDa. They were further characterized using GC-MS and FTIR.
TI  - Effects of a skin neuropeptide (substance p) on cutaneous microflora.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Skin is the largest human neuroendocrine organ and hosts the second most numerous microbial population but the interaction of skin neuropeptides with the microflora has never been investigated. We studied the effect of Substance P (SP), a peptide released by nerve endings in the skin on bacterial virulence. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Bacillus cereus, a member of the skin transient microflora, was used as a model. Exposure to SP strongly stimulated the cytotoxicity of B. cereus (+553+/-3% with SP 10(-6) M) and this effect was rapid (<5 min). Infection of keratinocytes with SP treated B. cereus led to a rise in caspase1 and morphological alterations of the actin cytoskeleton. Secretome analysis revealed that SP stimulated the release of collagenase and superoxide dismutase. Moreover, we also noted a shift in the surface polarity of the bacteria linked to a peel-off of the S-layer and the release of S-layer proteins. Meanwhile, the biofilm formation activity of B. cereus was increased. The Thermo unstable ribosomal Elongation factor (Ef-Tu) was identified as the SP binding site in B. cereus. Other Gram positive skin bacteria, namely Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis also reacted to SP by an increase of virulence. Thermal water from Uriage-les-Bains and an artificial polysaccharide (Teflose(R)) were capable to antagonize the effect of SP on bacterial virulence. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: SP is released in sweat during stress and is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of numerous skin diseases through neurogenic inflammation. Our study suggests that a direct effect of SP on the skin microbiote should be another mechanism.
TI  - Paraben resistance in bacteria from sewage treatment plant effluents in India.
AB  - Parabens, the antimicrobial preservatives used in cosmetics, food and pharmaceuticals, are often detected in the aquatic environment. Generally, sewage treatment plants (STPs) receive community sewage containing parabens, which are ultimately released into streams/rivers. In this study, bacteria in STP effluents were evaluated for their resistance to parabens. The susceptibility was in the order of Staphylococcus aureus > Bacillus sp. >Escherichia coli > Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Gram-negative bacteria showed less susceptibility than their control and Gram-positive bacteria. Further, the bacteria were more sensitive towards butyl and ethyl parabens. Interestingly, the strains showed resistance to >/=5 mg of parabens, which is equivalent to or higher than reported environmental concentrations. The increase in paraben chain length did not enhance the susceptibility in all cases and it was understood that the activity may differ for each bacterium in the environment. This is the first profile on paraben resistance in common pathogens of Indian STPs. Paraben resistance may be developed due to continuous exposure even at sub-inhibitory and/or chronic levels in the environment and this resistance may be transferred to other pathogenic bacteria in receiving waters. Thus the study demonstrates the effectiveness of the disc diffusion method in environmental bacterial resistance assessment and addresses the risk involved in the use of parabens.
TI  - Pimarane diterpenes from the Arctic fungus Eutypella sp. D-1.
AB  - Two new diterpenes, libertellenone G(1) and libertellenone H(2) were isolated from the fungus Eutypella sp. D-1 isolated from the soil of high latitude of Arctic, together with two known pimarane diterpenes (3-4). The structures of 1 and 2 were elucidated from spectroscopic data (nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrometry and infrared). These compounds were evaluated for cytotoxic activity against seven human tumor cell lines. Compound 2 showed a range of cytotoxicity between 3.31 and 44.1 muM. Compound 1 exhibited antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Chemical constituents of Aspergillus sp EJC08 isolated as endophyte from Bauhinia guianensis and their antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The present work reports the isolation of five compounds from Aspergillus sp EJC08 isolated as endophytic from Bauhinia guianensis, a tipical plant of the Amazon. The compounds ergosterol (1), ergosterol peroxide (2), mevalolactone (3), monomethylsulochrin (4) and trypacidin A (5) were isolated by chromatographic procedures and identified by spectral methods of 1D and 2D NMR and MS. Compounds 3, 4 and 5 were tested against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus and showed good activity.
TI  - New spirotetronate antibiotics, lobophorins H and I, from a South China Sea-derived Streptomyces sp. 12A35.
AB  - Strain 12A35 was isolated from a deep-sea sediment collected from the South China Sea and showed promising antibacterial activities. It was identified as Streptomyces sp. by the 16S rDNA sequence analysis. Bioassay-guided fractionation using HP20 adsorption, flash chromatography over silica gel and octadecylsilyl (ODS) and semi-preparative HPLC, led to the isolation and purification of five metabolites from the fermentation culture of 12A35. Two new spirotetronate antibiotics, lobophorins H (1) and I (2), along with three known analogues, O-beta-kijanosyl-(1-->17)-kijanolide (3), lobophorins B (4) and F (5) were characterized by 1D, 2D-NMR and MS data. These compounds exhibited significant inhibitory activities against Bacillus subtilis. Compounds 1 and 5 exhibited moderate activities against Staphylococcus aureus. In particular, the new compound lobophorin H (1) showed similar antibacterial activities against B. subtilis CMCC63501 to ampicillin.
TI  - [Expression optimization and characterization of Tenebrio molitor antimicrobiol peptides TmAMP1m in Escherichia coli].
AB  - To improve the expression level of tmAMP1m gene from Tenebrio molitor in Escherichia coli, we studied the effects of expression level and activity of the fusion protein HIS-TmAMP1m by conditions, such as culture temperature, inducing time and the final concentration of inductor Isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). We analyzed the optimum expression conditions by Tricine-SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, meanwhile, detected its antibacterial activity by using agarose cavity diffusion method. The results suggest that when inducing the recombinant plasmid with a final IPTG concentration of 0.1 mmol/L at 37 degrees C for 4 h, there was the highest expression level of fusion protein HIS-TmAMP1m in Escherichia coli. Under these conditions, the expression of fusion protein accounted for 40% of the total cell lysate with the best antibacterial activity. We purified the fusion protein HIS-TmAMPlm with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) metal-affinity chromatography matrices. Western blotting analysis indicates that the His monoclonal antibody could be specifically bound to fusion protein HIS-TmAMPlm. After expression by inducing, the fusion protein could inhibit the growth of host cell transformed by pET30a-tmAMP1m. The fusion protein HIS-TmAMP1m had better stability and remained higher antibacterial activities when incubated at 100 degrees C for 10 h, repeated freeze thawing at -20 degrees C, dissolved in strong acid and alkali, or treated by organic solvents and protease. Moreover, the minimum inhibitory concentration results demonstrated that the fusion protein HIS-TmAMP1m has a good antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus sp., Corynebacterium glutamicum, Bacillus thuringiensis, Corynebacterium sp. This study laid the foundation to promote the application of insect antimicrobial peptides and further research.
TI  - The effectiveness of photocatalytic ionisation disinfection of filter materials.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of photocatalytic ionisation as a disinfection method for filter materials contaminated by microorganisms, and to assess how air relative humidity (RH), time and microbe type influence the effectiveness of this disinfection. In the quantitative analysis of a used car air filter, bacterial contamination equalled 1.2 x 10(5) cfu/cm2, fungal contamination was 3.8 x 10(6) cfu/cm2, and the isolated microorganisms were Aspergillus niger, Bacillus megaterium, Cladosporium herbarum, Cryptococcus laurenti, Micrococcus sp., Rhodotorula glutinis and Staphylococcus cohnii. In the model experiment, three isolates (C. herbarum, R. glutinis, S. cohnii) and 3 ATCC species (A. niger, E. coli, S. aureus) were used for photocatalytic ionisation disinfection. The conditions of effective photocatalytic ionisation disinfection (R > or = 99.9%) were established as 2-3 h at RH = 77% (bacteria) and 6-24 h at RH = 53% (fungi). RH has an influence on the effectiveness of the photocatalytic disinfection process; the highest effectiveness was obtained for bacteria at RH = 77%, with results 5% higher than for RH = 49%. The studies show that the sensitivity of microorganisms to photocatalytic ionisation disinfection is ordered as follows: Gram-positive bacteria (S. cohnii, S. aureus), Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli), yeasts (R. glutinis), and moulds (C. herbarum, A. niger). Of all the mathematical models used for the description of death dynamics after photocatalytic ionisation disinfection, the Chick-Watson model is the most useful, but for more resistant microorganisms, the delayed Chick-Watson model is highly recommended. It therefore seems, that the presented disinfection method of photocatalytic ionisation can be successfully used to clean filtration materials.
TI  - Production of peptide antibiotics by Bacillus sp. GU 057 indigenously isolated from saline soil.
AB  - A total of 112 soil samples were taken from differents areas of district D.I.Khan and Kohat (KPK) Pakistan and screened for production of antibiotics against the Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus. Widest zone of inhibition (18mm) was produced by microorganism isolated from saline soil. The strain was later identified as Bacillus GU057 by standard biochemical assays. Maximum activity (18mm inhibition zone) was observed against Staphylococcus aureus after 48 hours of incubation at pH 8 and 4% concentration of glucose. The antibiotic was identified by autobiography as bacitracin. The Bacillus strain GU057 was confirmed as good peptide antibiotic producer and can effectively be indulged as biocontrol agent.
TI  - Disinfection protocols to prevent cross-contamination between dental offices and  prosthetic laboratories.
AB  - Control of cross-contamination between dental offices and prosthetic laboratories is of utmost importance to maintain the health of patients and dental office staff. The purpose of this study was to evaluate disinfection protocols, considering antimicrobial effectiveness and damage to the structures of prostheses. Solutions of 1% sodium hypochlorite, 2% chlorhexidine digluconate, 50% vinegar and sodium perborate were evaluated. Specimens were contaminated in vitro with standardized suspensions of Candida albicans, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis spores. Disinfection by immersion for 10 min was performed. Final counts of microorganisms were obtained using the plating method. Results were statistically compared by Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA and Dunn's test. The surface roughness of 40 specimens was analyzed before and after 10 disinfection cycles, and results were compared statistically using Student's t test. The solution of 50% vinegar was as effective as 1% sodium hypochlorite and 2% chlorhexidine against C. albicans, E. coli and S. mutans. The sodium perborate solution showed the lowest antimicrobial effectiveness. Superficial roughness increased after cycles in 1% sodium hypochlorite (p=0.02). Solutions of 1% sodium hypochlorite, 2% chlorhexidine and 50% vinegar were effective for the disinfection of heat-polymerized acrylic specimens. Sodium hypochlorite increased the superficial roughness.
TI  - Phylogenetic diversity and antimicrobial activity of marine bacteria associated with the soft coral Sarcophyton glaucum.
AB  - Coral reefs are the most biodiverse and biologically productive of all marine ecosystems. Corals harbor diverse and abundant prokaryotic groups. However, little is known about the diversity of coral-associated microorganisms. We used molecular techniques to identify and compare the culturable bacterial assemblages associated with the soft coral Sarcophyton glaucum from the Red sea. Different media were utilized for microbial isolation, and the phylogeny of the culturable bacteria associated with the coral was analyzed based on 16S rDNA sequencing. The coral associated bacteria were found to be representatives within the Gammaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes. Antimicrobial activities of twenty bacterial isolates were tested against four pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio fluvialis) and three fungi (Penicillium sp., Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans). A relatively high proportion of bacterial strains displayed distinct antibacterial and antifungal activities, suggesting that soft coral-associated microorganisms may aid their host in protection against marine pathogens. Members of genera Bacillus and Pseudomonas had the highest proportion of antimicrobial activity which supported the hypothesis that they might play a protective role in the coral hosts.
TI  - Cyclic dipeptides from rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode-associated Bacillus cereus have antimicrobial activities.
AB  - The cell free culture filtrate of Bacillus cereus associated with an entomopathogenic nematode, Rhabditis (Oscheius) sp. exhibited strong antimicrobial activity. The ethyl acetate extract of the bacterial culture filtrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography to obtain four bioactive compounds. The structure and absolute stereochemistry of these compounds were determined based on extensive spectroscopic analyses (FABMS, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, (1)H-(1)H COSY, (1)H-(13)C HMBC) and Marfey's method. The compounds were identified as cyclic dipeptides (CDPs): cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp), cyclo(L-Leu-L-Val), cyclo(D-Pro-D-Met), and cyclo(D-Pro-D-Phe), respectively. Compounds recorded significant antibacterial activity against all the test bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant S. aureus) except cyclo(L-Leu-L-Val). Cyclo(L-Leu-L-Val) recorded activity only against Gram positive bacteria. Best antibacterial activity was recorded by cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp) against S. aureus (4 mug/ml). The four compounds were active against all the five fungi tested (Trichophyton rubrum, Aspergillus flavus, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis and Cryptococcus neoformans) and the activity was compared with amphotericin B, the standard fungicide. The highest activity of 1 mug/ml by cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp) was recorded against T. rubrum, a human pathogen responsible for causing athlete's foot, jock itch, and ringworm. The activity of cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp) against T. rubrum, C. neoformans and C. albicans were better than amphotericin B, the standard antifungal agent. To our knowledge, this is the first report of antifungal activity of CDPs against the human pathogenic fungi T. rubrum and C. neoformans. The four CDPs are nontoxic to healthy human cell line up to 200 mug/ml. We conclude that the bacterium associated with entomopathogenic nematode is promising sources of natural antimicrobial secondary metabolites, which may receive greater benefit as potential sources of new drugs in the pharmaceutical industry.
TI  - The diversity and antimicrobial activity of Preussia sp. endophytes isolated from Australian dry rainforests.
AB  - Limited knowledge currently exists regarding species diversity and antimicrobial  activity of endophytic isolates of Preussia within Australia. This report describes endophytic Preussia species that were identified through molecular analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region. Screening for antimicrobial secondary metabolites was determined by testing crude ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extracts derived from fungal mycelia against a panel of ATCC type strains which included Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and the opportunist yeast pathogen Candida albicans. Subsequently, high-performance liquid chromatography generated fractions of bioactive EtOAc extracts which were subject to confirmatory testing using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute reference microdilution antimicrobial activity assay. A total of 18 Preussia were isolated from nine host plants with 6/18 having a <97 % sequence similarity to other known species in Genbank, suggesting that they are new species. In preliminary screening, 13/18 Preussia isolates revealed antimicrobial activity against at least one of the microbes tested, whilst 6/18 isolates, including 4/6 putative new species showed specific antimicrobial activity against MRSA and C. albicans. These results highlight the antimicrobial potential of Australian Preussia spp. and also the importance of Australian dry rainforests as an untapped repository of potentially significant bioactive compounds.
TI  - Ophiobolins P-T, five new cytotoxic and antibacterial sesterterpenes from the endolichenic fungus Ulocladium sp.
AB  - Five ophiobolane sesterterpenes, ophiobolins P-T, and three known compounds, 6-epi-21,21-O-dihydroophiobolin G, 6-epi-ophiobolin G and 6-epi-ophiobolin K, were isolated from the acetone extract of the endolichenic fungus Ulocladium sp. by using OSMAC method. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic analysis. The absolute configuration of the 18,19-diol moieties in ophiobolin Q was assigned using the Frelek's method. The cytotoxic effects on KB and HepG2 cell lines, antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacille Calmette-Guerin were evaluated for all isolated compounds. Ophiobolin T and 6-epi-ophiobolin G exhibited the most potent cytotoxic activity against HepG2 with IC(5)(0) of 0.24 and 0.37 muM, respectively. In antibacterial assay, ophiobolins P and T showed moderate antibacterial activity against B. subtilis and meticillin-resistant S. aureus. Ophiobolin T also displayed moderate antibacterial activity against the Bacille Calmette-Guerin strain.
TI  - Bioactive metabolites from an endophytic Cryptosporiopsis sp. inhabiting Clidemia hirta.
AB  - An endophytic Cryptosporiopsis sp. was isolated from Clidemia hirta and analyzed  for its secondary metabolites that lead to the isolation of three bioactive molecules. The compounds were purified from the culture broth of the fungus and their structures were determined by spectroscopic methods as (R)-5-hydroxy-2-methylchroman-4-one (1), 1-(2,6-dihydroxyphenyl)pentan-1-one (2) and (Z)-1-(2-(2-butyryl-3-hydroxyphenoxy)-6-hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxybut-2-en-1-one (3). Compound 1 exhibited significant cytotoxic activity against the human leukemia cell line, HL-60 with an IC50 of 4 mug/ml. This compound induced G2 arrest of the HL-60 cell cycle significantly. In addition, out of these compounds, 2 and 3 were active against several bacterial pathogens. Compound 2 was active against Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus with IC50 values varying from 18 to 30 mug/ml, and compound 3 displayed activity against Pseudomonas fluorescens with an IC50 value of 6 mug/ml. Compounds 2 and 3 are novel whereas compound 1 was reported earlier but the stereochemistry of its C-2 methyl is established for the first time.
TI  - New phenethylamine derivatives from Arenibacter nanhaiticus sp. nov. NH36A(T) and their antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Five new phenethylamine (PEA) derivatives (1-5) were isolated from the strain of  Arenibacter nanhaiticus sp. nov. NH36A(T) derived from the marine sediment of the South China Sea by bioassay-guided fractionation. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic methods including UV, IR, HR-MS and NMR. Interestingly, compounds 1-4 existed as enantiomers, which were resolved by chiral liquid chromatography. The resolved configuration of each enantiomer was assigned by the Marfey's method. Of these compounds, 5 showed weak antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis with MIC values of 0.50 and 0.25 mg ml(-1), respectively.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of unused, disposable non-sterile gloves on a hospital orthopaedic ward.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-sterile disposable gloves are used on large hospital wards, however their potential role as a vehicle for pathogen transmission has not been explored in this setting. AIMS: This study investigates glove use on a hospital orthopaedic ward to examine whether pathogen contamination occurs prior to contact with patients. METHOD: Glove samples were aseptically removed from boxes on a hospital orthopaedic ward on opening and days 3, 6 and 9 thereafter. Following elution of bacteria and viable counts, glove isolates were identified by standard techniques and 16s rDNA sequencing. Methicillin resistance of staphylococci was determined by disc diffusion, Epsilon tests and PCR. Gloves were inoculated to determine two isolate survival rates. RESULTS: Total bacterial counts ranged from 0 to 9.6 x 10(3) cfu/glove. Environmental bacteria, particularly Bacillus species, were present on 31/38 (81.6%) of samples. Half (19/38) the samples were contaminated with skin commensals; coagulase negative staphylococci were predominant. Enterococcus faecalis , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Pseudomonas sp. or methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus were recovered from 5/38 (13.2%) of samples. Significantly more skin commensals and pathogens were recovered from samples from days 3, 6, 9 than box-opening samples. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Klebsiella pneumoniae inoculated onto gloves remained viable for several days but counts decreased. CONCLUSION: Health care workers introduced skin commensals and pathogenic bacteria into glove boxes indicating that unused, non-sterile gloves are potential pathogen transmission vehicles in hospitals. Findings highlight adherence to handwashing guidelines, common glove retrieval practice, and glove-box design as targets for decreasing bacteria transmission via gloves on hospital wards.
TI  - Optimization of media and temperature for enhanced antimicrobial production by bacteria associated with Rhabditis sp.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Entomopathogenic nematodes, belonging to the family heterorhabditis and steinernematidae, are reported to be symbiotically associated with specific bacteria and the secondary metabolites produced by these bacteria possess antimicrobial activity. In this study, bacteria were isolated from nematodes belonging to the family rhabditidae, and the antimicrobial activity was tested against four bacteria viz. Bacillus subtilis MTCC 2756, Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 902, Escherichia coli MTCC 2622, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 2642 and five fungi viz. Aspergillus flavus MTCC 183, Candida albicans MTCC 277, Fusarium oxysporum MTCC 284, Rhizoctonia solani MTCC 4634 and Penicillium expansum MTCC 2006. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The isolated bacteria were cultured in nutrient broth (NB), Luria broth (LB) and Tryptic soya broth (TSB) at 25, 30 and 35 degrees C. Cell free culture filtrate was prepared by centrifugation and was separated into organic and aqueous fractions. Organic fraction was concentrated and tested for antimicrobial activity. RESULTS: The culture filtrate of the bacteria isolated from the entomopathogenic Rhabditis sp. was found to possess antimicrobial activity against the four bacteria and five fungi tested. The bacterium grew well in TSB, LB and NB media though in TSB yield and activity were higher. Antimicrobial activity was higher at 30 degrees C as compared with 25 or 35 degrees C. HPLC analysis indicated major differences in peak areas and retention times at different temperatures. Increased number of peaks with higher peak areas was obtained at 30 degrees C. CONCLUSION: The study suggests that the bacteria could produce more bioactive molecules effective against medically and agriculturally important bacteria and fungi depending on culture media and temperature. Modified media could yield different types of molecules effective against diseases/disorders of plant, animals and humans.
TI  - Microalgae mediated synthesis of silver nanoparticles and their antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Silver nanoparticles is known to have antimicrobial affects. Cyanobacteria isolates from muthupet mangrove includes Aphanothece sp, Oscillatoria sp, Microcoleus sp, Aphanocapsa sp, Phormidium sp, Lyngbya sp, Gleocapsa sp, Synechococcus sp, Spirulina sp with were set in compliance with their cellular mechanism of nano silver creation, and were investigated by UV-VIS spectrophotometer, Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Silver nanoparticles were spherical shaped well distributed without aggregation in solution with an average size of about 40- 80 nm. Synthesised nano silver had antibacterial production on various organisms that provoked various diseases in humans. The cellular metabolites of Microcoleus sp. only created nano silver and it enhanced the antibacterial activity against test pathogenic bacteria from MTCC (Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella typhi, Vibrio cholera, Streptococcus sp., Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli.) The antimicrobial assay was performed using 0.001 M concentration of nano silver in well diffusion method with positive control of appropriate standard antibiotic discs Cephotaxime, Ampicillin, Tetracyclin, Cephalexin etc. Synthesised silver nanoparticles acted as an effective antimicrobial agent and proved as an alternative for the development of new antimicrobial agents to combat the problem of resistance.

Napyradiomycins 2, 4, 6, and 7 exhibited moderate cytotoxicities against four human cancer cell lines SF-268, MCF-7, NCI-H460, and HepG-2 with IC(5)(0) values below 20 muM, while the IC(5)(0) values for other five napyradiomycins 1, 3, 5, 8 and 9 were above 20 muM.
TI  - Bioactive phenylalanine derivatives and cytochalasins from the soft coral-derived fungus, Aspergillus elegans.
AB  - One new phenylalanine derivative 4'-OMe-asperphenamate (1), along with one known  phenylalanine derivative (2) and two new cytochalasins, aspochalasin A1 (3) and cytochalasin Z24 (4), as well as eight known cytochalasin analogues (5-12) were isolated from the fermentation broth of Aspergillus elegans ZJ-2008010, a fungus obtained from a soft coral Sarcophyton sp. collected from the South China Sea. Their structures and the relative configurations were elucidated using comprehensive spectroscopic methods. The absolute configuration of 1 was determined by chemical synthesis and Marfey's method. All isolated metabolites (1-12) were evaluated for their antifouling and antibacterial activities. Cytochalasins 5, 6, 8 and 9 showed strong antifouling activity against the larval settlement of the barnacle Balanus amphitrite, with the EC50 values ranging from 6.2 to 37 muM. This is the first report of antifouling activity for this class of metabolites. Additionally, 8 exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, especially against four pathogenic bacteria Staphylococcus albus, S. aureus, Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus.
TI  - Efficacy of decontamination and sterilization of a single-use single-incision laparoscopic surgery port.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of decontamination and sterilization of a disposable port intended for use during single-incision laparoscopy. SAMPLE: 5 material samples obtained from each of 3 laparoscopic surgery ports. PROCEDURES: Ports were assigned to undergo decontamination and ethylene oxide sterilization without bacterial inoculation (negative control port), with bacterial inoculation (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Mycobacterium fortuitum) and without decontamination and sterilization (positive control port), or with bacterial inoculation followed by decontamination and ethylene oxide sterilization (treated port). Each port underwent testing 5 times; during each time, a sample of the foam portion of each port was obtained and bacteriologic culture testing was performed. Bacteriologic culture scores were determined for each port sample. RESULTS: None of the treated port samples had positive bacteriologic culture results. All 5 positive control port samples had positive bacteriologic culture results. One negative control port sample had positive bacteriologic culture results; a spore-forming Bacillus sp organism was cultured from that port sample, which was thought to be an environmental contaminant. Bacteriologic culture scores for the treated port samples were significantly lower than those for the positive control port samples. Bacteriologic culture scores for the treated port samples were not significantly different from those for negative control port samples. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results of this study indicated standard procedures for decontamination and sterilization of a single-use port intended for use during singleincision laparoscopic surgery were effective for elimination of inoculated bacteria. Reuse of this port may be safe for laparoscopic surgery of animals.
TI  - cgMolluscidin, a novel dibasic residue repeat rich antimicrobial peptide, purified from the gill of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas.
AB  - A 5.5 kDa antimicrobial peptide consisting of 55 amino acids, cgMolluscidin, was  purified from the acidified gill extract of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, by ion-exchange and C18 reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. By comparing the N-terminal amino acid sequences and the molecular weight of this peptide with those of other known antimicrobial peptides, it has been revealed that this peptide had no homology with any known peptides. cgMolluscidin showed potent antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus (minimal effective concentrations [MECs]; 1.3-31.3 mug/mL), and Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus ([MECs]; 0.4-2.3 mug/mL), without hemolytic activity. However, cgMolluscidin did not show any significant activity against Candida albicans. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cgMolluscidin showed no hit in public protein databases, while the nucleotide sequence had a 99% homology (E value = 0) with only the unknown ESTs sequenced by C. gigas EST project. Tissue distribution of the cgMolluscidin mRNA suggests that it is constitutively expressed as a mature form in a non-tissue-specific manner. The cgMolluscidin mRNA expression level was significantly up-regulated at 12 h (2.8-fold) post injection with Vibrio sp. This peptide is highly basic and contains several dibasic residue repeats including Lysine-Lysine or Lysine-Arginine in the sequence, but may not form an ordered structure. These results suggest that cgMolluscidin might be an oyster-specific novel antimicrobial peptide.
TI  - Microalgae associated Brevundimonas sp. MSK 4 as the nano particle synthesizing unit to produce antimicrobial silver nanoparticles.
AB  - The biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles and its antimicrobial property was studied using bacteria isolated from Spirulina products. Isolated bacteria were identified as Bacillus sp. MSK 1 (JX495945), Staphylococcus sp. MSK 2 (JX495946), Bacillus sp. MSK 3 (JX495947) and Brevundimonas sp. MSK 4 (JX495948). Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized using bacterial culture filtrate with AgNO3. The initial syntheses of Ag nanoparticles were characterized by UV-vis spectrophotometer (by measuring the color change to intense brown). Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) study showed evidence that proteins are possible reducing agents and Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) study showing the metal silver as major signal. The structure of AgNPs was determined by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Synthesized Ag nanoparticles with an average size of 40-65 nm have antimicrobial property against human pathogens like Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella typhi, Vibrio cholera, Streptococcus sp., Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Among the isolates Brevundimonas sp. MSK 4 alone showed good activity in both synthesis of AgNPs and antimicrobial activity. This work demonstrates the possible use of biological synthesized silver nanoparticles to combat the drug resistant problem.
TI  - A new antimicrobial and anticancer peptide producing by the marine deep sediment  strain "Paenibacillus profundus" sp. nov. Sl 79.
AB  - A new linear glyceryl acid derived heptapeptide (1), together with known isocoumarin antibiotic, Y-05460M-A (2), were isolated from the culture of the deep sea sediment strain SI 79 classified as "Paenibacillus profundus" sp. nov. Their structures were determined by 1D- and 2D- NMR techniques and ESI-MS/MS experiments. HPLC analysis of the Marfey derivatives in comparison to their analogs of authentic amino acids revealed that all amino acids in peptide 1, with an exception of Val, have the D-configuration. The compound 1 showed inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecium as well as cytotoxic and moderate colony growth inhibitory activity against SK-MEL-28 cell line.
TI  - Synergized antimicrobial activity of eugenol incorporated polyhydroxybutyrate films against food spoilage microorganisms in conjunction with pediocin.
AB  - Biopolymers and biopreservatives produced by microorganisms play an essential role in food technology. Polyhydroxyalkanoates and bacteriocins produced by bacteria are promising components to safeguard the environment and for food preservation applications. Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB)-based antimicrobial films were prepared incorporating eugenol, from 10 to 200 mug/g of PHB. The films were evaluated for antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens, spoilage bacteria, and fungi such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus cereus, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Penicillium sp., and Rhizopus sp. The synergistic antimicrobial activity of the films in the presence of crude pediocin was also investigated. The broth system containing pediocin (soluble form) as well as antimicrobial PHB film demonstrated an extended lag phase and a significant growth reduction at the end of 24 h against the bacteria. Crude pediocin alone could not elicit antifungal activity, while inhibition of growth and sporulation were observed in the presence of antimicrobial PHB film containing eugenol (80 mug/g) until 7 days in the case of molds, i.e., A. niger, A. flavus, Penicillium sp., and Rhizopus sp. in potato dextrose broth. In the present study, we identified that use of pediocin containing broth in conjunction with eugenol incorporated PHB film could function in synergized form, providing effective hurdle toward food contaminating microorganisms. Furthermore, tensile strength, percent crystallinity, melting point, percent elongation to break, glass transition temperature, and seal strength of the PHB film with and without eugenol incorporation were investigated. The migration of eugenol on exposure to different liquid food simulants was also analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The study is expected to provide applications for pediocin in conjunction with eugenol containing PHB film to enhance the shelf life of foods in the food industry.
TI  - Waldiomycin, a novel WalK-histidine kinase inhibitor from Streptomyces sp. MK844-mF10.
AB  - WalK, a histidine kinase, and WalR, a response regulator, make up a two-component signal transduction system that is indispensable for the cell-wall metabolism of low GC Gram-positive bacteria. WalK inhibitors are likely to show bactericidal effects against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus . We discovered a new WalK inhibitor, designated waldiomycin, by screening metabolites from actinomycetes. Waldiomycin belongs to the family of angucycline antibiotics and is structurally related to dioxamycin. Waldiomycin inhibits WalK from S. aureus and Bacillus subtilis at IC50s 8.8 and 10.2 muM, respectively, and shows antibacterial activity with MICs ranging from 4 to 8 mug ml(-1) against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and B. subtilis.
TI  - Microbiological assessment of indoor air of a teaching hospital in Nigeria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the quality of indoor air of different wards and units  of Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital, Sagamu, to ascertain their contribution to infection rate in the hospital. METHODS: The microbial quality of indoor air of nine wards/units of Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital, Sagamu, Nigeria was conducted. Sedimentation technique using open Petri-dishes containing different culture media was employed and samplings were done twice daily, one in the morning shortly after cleaning and before influx of people/patients into the wards/units and the other in the evening when a lot of activities would have taken place in these wards. Isolates were identified according to standard methods. RESULTS: Results showed that there was a statistically significant difference (chi(2) = 6.016 7) in the bacteria population of the different sampling time whereas it was not so for fungi population (chi(2) = 0.285 7). Male medical ward (MMW) and male surgical general (MSG) recorded the highest bacterial and fungal growth while the operating theatre (OT) was almost free of microbial burden. The bacteria isolates were Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella sp., Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Serratia marscences while the fungi isolates included Aspergillus flavus, Penicillium sp., Fusarium sp., Candida albicans and Alternaria sp. Staphylococcus aureus was the predominantly isolated bacterium while Penicillium sp. was the most isolated fungus. CONCLUSIONS: Though most of the microbial isolates were potential and or opportunistic pathogens, there was no correlation between the isolates in this study and the surveillance report of nosocomial infection during the period of study, hence the contribution of the indoor air cannot be established. From the reduction noticed in the morning samples, stringent measures such as proper disinfection and regular cleaning, restriction of patient relatives' movement in and out of the wards/units need to be enforced so as to improve the quality of indoor air of our hospital wards/units.
TI  - 03219A, a new Delta(8,9)-pregnene isolated from Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 03219 obtained from a South China Sea sediment.
AB  - 03219A (1), a new pregnene steroid possessing a rare Delta(8,9)-double bond in the skeleton, together with the known naphthoquinone antibiotic (+)-cryptosporin (2) have been isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 03219, which was isolated from a marine sediment collected in the South China Sea. The structure of 03219A was elucidated using a combination of NMR, MS and X-ray crystallographic methods.
TI  - Effects of various pressing programs and yields on the antioxidant activity, antimicrobial activity, phenolic content and colour of pomegranate juices.
AB  - Pomegranate juice (PJ) samples were produced with three different pressing programs: (1) 1.2-4.8 bar for 25 min, (2) 1.2-2.4 bar for 15 min and (3) 1.2-1.8 bar for 5.5 min. Respective juice yields were 39.2%, 33.2% and 27.2%. Effects of pressing pressure-time and yield on total phenolic (TP) content, condensed tannin (CT) content, monomeric anthocyanin (MA) content, antioxidant activity (AOA) and antimicrobial activity (AMA) of the samples were determined. Strong positive linear correlations were found between the pressing pressure with AOA (r=0.973) and TP content (r=0.979), while negative logarithmic correlations were found between pressing pressure with the contents of CT (r=-0.778) and MA (r=-0.955). Among 12 microorganisms tested, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus subtilis, Staphyloccocus aureus and Pseudomonas sp. were found to be sensitive to juice samples. However, increasing pressing pressure and yield did not lead to a significant change on the AMAs of the juices.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of Cichorium intybus root extract using  orthogonal matrix design.
AB  - Solvent, impregnation time, sonication repetitions, and ultrasonic power were important factors in the process of ultrasound-assisted extraction from chicory (Cichorium intybus) root, while there were no studies about optimizing these 4 factors for extract yield, total phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant, antibacterial, and antifungal activity of the extracts using orthogonal matrix design. The present research demonstrated that the solvent composition played a significant role in the improving extract yield, TPC, antioxidant, and antibacterial activities. The other 3 factors had inequable effect on different purposes, ultrasonic power could improve TPC and antioxidant activity, but long time of extraction lowered antioxidant activity. The TPC increased from 22.34 to 27.87 mg GAE (gallic acid equivalents)/100 g (dry extracts) with increasing solvent polarity. The half inhibition concentration (IC(50,) mug/mL) of the radical scavenging activity of the chicory extracts ranged from 281.00 to 983.33 mug/mL. The content of caffeoylquinic acids of root extract, which was extracted by the optimal combination was 0.104%. Several extracts displayed antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus subtilis, and Salmonella typhi, while Penicillium sp. and Aspergillus sp. resisted against all the extracts. Combination of 70% ethanol v/v, 24-h impregnation time, 3 sonication rounds, and 300-W ultrasonic input power was found to be the optimal combination for the chicory extract yield, TPC, antioxidant activity, and antibacterial activity.
TI  - Screening antimicrobial activity of various extracts of Urtica dioica.
AB  - Urtica dioica or stinging nettle is traditionally used as an herbal medicine in Western Asia. The current study represents the investigation of antimicrobial activity of U. dioica from nine crude extracts that were prepared using different organic solvents, obtained from two extraction methods: the Soxhlet extractor (Method I), which included the use of four solvents with ethyl acetate and hexane, or the sequential partitions (Method II) with a five solvent system (butanol). The antibacterial and antifungal activities of crude extracts were tested against 28 bacteria, three yeast strains and seven fungal isolates by the disc diffusion and broth dilution methods. Amoxicillin was used as positive control for bacteria strains, vancomycin for Streptococcus sp., miconazole nitrate (30 microg/mL) as positive control for fungi and yeast, and pure methanol (v/v) as negative control. The disc diffusion assay was used to determine the sensitivity of the samples, whilst the broth dilution method was used for the determination of the minimal inhibition concentration (MIC). The ethyl acetate and hexane extract from extraction method I (EA I and HE I) exhibited highest inhibition against some pathogenic bacteria such as Bacillus cereus, MRSA and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. A selection of extracts that showed some activity was further tested for the MIC and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC). MIC values of Bacillus subtilis and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) using butanol extract of extraction method II (BE II) were 8.33 and 16.33mg/mL, respectively; while the MIC value using ethyl acetate extract of extraction method II (EAE II) for Vibrio parahaemolyticus was 0.13mg/mL. Our study showed that 47.06% of extracts inhibited Gram-negative (8 out of 17), and 63.63% of extracts also inhibited Gram-positive bacteria (7 out of 11); besides, statistically the frequency of antimicrobial activity was 13.45% (35 out of 342) which in this among 21.71% belongs to antimicrobial activity extracts from extraction method I (33 out of 152 of crude extracts) and 6.82% from extraction method II (13 out of 190 of crude extracts). However, crude extracts from method I exhibited better antimicrobial activity against the Gram-positive bacteria than the Gram-negative bacteria. The positive results on medicinal plants screening for antibacterial activity constitutes primary information for further phytochemical and pharmacological studies. Therefore, the extracts could be suitable as antimicrobial agents in pharmaceutical and food industry.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities of crude plant extracts from Colombian biodiversity.
AB  - On a global scale, people have used plants to treat diseases and infections, and  this has raised interest on the plant biodiversity potencial in the search of antimicrobial principles. In this work, 75 crude n-hexanes, dichloromethane and methanol extracts from the aerial parts of 25 plants belonging to four botanical families (Asteraceae, Euphorbiaceae, Rubiaceae and Solanaceae), collected at the Natural Regional Park Ucumari (Risaralda, Colombia), were evaluated for their antibacterial and antifungal activities by the agar well diffusion method. The antibacterial activities were assayed against two Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, and three Gram-negative ones named, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In addition, the same plant extracts were tested against the yeast Candida albicans and the fungi Aspergillus fumigatus and Fusarium solani. Overall, the plant extracts examined displayed better bactericide rather than fungicide activities. In general, the best antibacterial activity was showed by the plant extracts from the Rubiaceae family, followed in order by the extracts from the Euphorbiaceae and Solanaceae ones. It is important to emphasize the great activity displayed by the methanol extract of Alchornea coelophylla (Euphorbiaceae) that inhibited four out of five bacteria tested (B. Subtilis, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and E. coli). Furthermore, the best Minimal Inhibitory Concentration for the extracts with antifungal activities were displayed by the dichloromethane extracts from Acalypha diversifolia and Euphorbia sp (Euphorbiaceae). The most susceptible fungus evaluated was F. Solani since 60% and 20% of the dichloromethane and methanol extracts evaluated inhibited the growth of this phytopathogenic fungus. The antimicrobial activity of the different plant extracts examined in this work could be related to the secondary metabolites contents and their interaction and susceptibility of pathogenic microorganism evaluated.
TI  - Gene identification and recombinant protein of a lysozyme from freshwater mussel  Cristaria plicata.
AB  - Lysozymes are important proteins to bivalve in the innate immune responses against bacterial infections, and provide nutrition as digestion enzymes. A new LYZ1 from the freshwater mussel Cristaria plicata was cloned by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and nested PCR method. The full-length cDNA sequence of CpLYZ1 was 763 bp. The cDNA contained a 5'-terminal untranslated region (UTR) of 21 bp, a 3'- terminal UTR of 259 bp with a 29 bp poly(A) tail, a tailing signal (AATAAA) and the open reading frame of 483 bp. The CpLYZ1 cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 160 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 17.8 kDa, and a theoretical isoelectric point of 6.07. The comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences with LYZs from other species showed that the enzyme belonged to i-type lysozyme. The mRNA transcript of CpLYZ1 could be detected in all the examined tissues with the highest expression level in hepatopancreas. The expression levels of CpLYZ1 in hemocytes, hepatopancreas and gill significantly increased after Aeromonas hydrophila challenge. The expression level of CpLYZ1 in hemocytes sharply decreased from 6 h to 24 h and significantly increased at 48 h, and was the highest level in hepatopancreas at 24 h, and was the maximum level in gill at 48 h. Furthermore, the recombinant CpLYZ1 was induced to be expressed as an inclusion body form by IPTG at 37 degrees C for 4 h, and then was purified by using the Ni(2+) affinity chromatography. The relative enzyme activity of the recombinant CpLYZ1 was influenced on pH and temperature. The optimal pH and temperature was 5.5 and 50 degrees C, respectively. Against Escherichia coli, A. hydrophila, Staphyloccocus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus sp. and Staphylococcus epidermidis, the recombinant CpLYZ1 had bacteriolytic activity.
TI  - Actinopyga lecanora hydrolysates as natural antibacterial agents.
AB  - Actinopyga lecanora, a type of sea cucumber commonly known as stone fish with relatively high protein content, was explored as raw material for bioactive peptides production. Six proteolytic enzymes, namely alcalase, papain, pepsin, trypsin, bromelain and flavourzyme were used to hydrolyze A. lecanora at different times and their respective degrees of hydrolysis (DH) were calculated. Subsequently, antibacterial activity of the A. lecanora hydrolysates, against some common pathogenic Gram positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas sp.) were evaluated. Papain hydrolysis showed the highest DH value (89.44%), followed by alcalase hydrolysis (83.35%). Bromelain hydrolysate after one and seven hours of hydrolysis exhibited the highest antibacterial activities against Pseudomonas sp., P. aeruginosa and E. coli at 51.85%, 30.07% and 30.45%, respectively compared to the other hydrolysates. Protein hydrolysate generated by papain after 8 h hydrolysis showed maximum antibacterial activity against S. aureus at 20.19%. The potent hydrolysates were further fractionated using RP-HPLC and antibacterial activity of the collected fractions from each hydrolysate were evaluated, wherein among them only three fractions from the bromelain hydrolysates exhibited inhibitory activities against Pseudomonas sp., P. aeruginosa and E. coli at 24%, 25.5% and 27.1%, respectively and one fraction of papain hydrolysate showed antibacterial activity of 33.1% against S. aureus. The evaluation of the relationship between DH and antibacterial activities of papain and bromelain hydrolysates revealed a meaningful correlation of four and six order functions.
TI  - Nurses' uniforms: How many bacteria do they carry after one shift?
AB  - This pilot study investigated the pathogens that nurses are potentially bringing  into the public and their home when they wear work uniforms outside of the work environment. To achieve this, sterilized uniforms were distributed to 10 nurses at a local hospital in Washington State at the beginning of their shift. Worn uniforms were collected at the end of the shifts and sent to a laboratory for analysis. Four tests were conducted: 1) a heterotrophic growth plate count, 2) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) growth, 3) vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE), and 4) identification of the heterotrophic plate counts. Each participant completed a questionnaire and a survey. The results showed that the average bacteria colony growth per square inch was 1,246 and 5,795 for day and night shift, respectively. After 48 h, MRSA positives were present on 4 of the day shift and 3 of the night shift uniforms. Additional bacteria identified include: Bacillus sp., Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Micrococcus roseus. The significant presence of bacteria on the uniforms 48 h after the shift ended necessitates further study, discussions and policy consideration regarding wearing health care uniforms outside of the work environment.
TI  - Two new alkaloids from marine sponge Callyspongia sp.
AB  - Two new alkaloids, callylactam A (1) and callyimine A (4), along with three known ones (2, 3 and 5), were isolated from the marine sponge Callyspongia sp. The structures were determined on the basis of NMR and MS analysis.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of ozonated water on the sanitization of dental instruments contaminated with E. coli, S. aureus, C. albicans, or the spores of B. atrophaeus.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ozone has been used as an alternative method for the decontamination  of water, food, equipment and instruments. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of ozonated water on the sanitization of dental instruments that were contaminated by Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and the spores of Bacillus atrophaeus. METHODS: A total of one hundred and twenty standardized samples of diamond dental burs were experimentally contaminated with E. coli (ATCC 25922), S. aureus (ATCC 6538) and C. albicans (ATCC 18804) and the spores of B. atrophaeus (ATCC 6633) for 30 min. After the contamination, the samples were exposed to ozonated water (10mg/L O(3)) for 10 or 30min. The control group was composed of samples that were exposed to distilled water for 30 min. After the exposure to the ozonated water, 0.1 mL aliquots were seeded onto BHI agar to count the colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) of E. coli, S. aureus, and B. atrophaeus. Sabouraud dextrose agar was used to count the CFU/mL of C. albicans. The results were subjected to an analysis of variance and the Tukey test. RESULTS: For all of the microorganisms studied, the ozonated water reduced the number of CFU/mL after 10 and 30 min of sanitization, and this microbial reduction was dependent on the duration of the exposure to the ozonated water. E. coli exhibited the greatest reduction in CFU/mL (2.72-3.78 log) followed by S. aureus (2.14-3.19 log), C. albicans (1.44-2.14 log) and the spores of B. atrophaeus (1.01-1.98 log). CONCLUSION: The ozonated water was effective in reducing the CFU of E. coli, S. aureus, C. albicans and B. atrophaeus spores, suggesting that ozonated water can be used for the sanitization of dental instruments.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities of polyketide metabolite from marine Streptomyces sp. AP-123 and its cytotoxic effect.
AB  - A Gram positive, filamentous, spore forming antagonistic Streptomyces sp. AP-123  derived from marine region of Andra Pradesh, India, was studied for its medical importance. Among the 210 Streptomyces strains screened at 64.3% exhibited activity against Gram positive bacteria, 48.5% showed activity towards Gram negative bacteria, 38.8% exhibited both Gram positive and negative bacteria and 80.85% strains revealed significant antifungal activity. However, primary screening revealed that Streptomyces sp. AP-123 exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against all the tested bacteria compared to other Streptomyces strains. The presence of l-diaminopimelic acid and glycine in the cell wall hydrolysates and streptomycin resistance indicated the strain belonged to Streptomyces genus. The 16S rDNA gene based phylogenetic affiliation was determined by using bioinformatic tools and it was identified as Streptomyces sp. AP-123 with 99% sequence similarity to Streptomyces flavogriseus. The antimicrobial substances were extracted by hexane and ethyl acetate from spent medium in which Streptomyces sp. AP-123 was cultivated at 30 degrees C for 5 d. The antimicrobial activity was assessed using broth micro-dilution technique. A compound was obtained by eluting the crude extract using varying concentrations of solvents followed by the chromatographic purification. Based on the IR, (13)C NMR and (1)H NMR spectral data, the compound was identified as polyketide related antibiotic. It exhibited significant antibacterial activity against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria and also showed a potent cytotoxic activity against cell lines viz. Vero (Green monkey kidney) and HEP2 (laryngeal carcinoma cells) in vitro. The lowest Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the compound against Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus were 25 and 37.5 mug mL(-1), respectively. Against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa it exhibited MIC of 50 and 37.58 mug mL(-1), respectively. However, against Candida albicans and filamentous fungus, Aspergillus niger the MIC values were 12.5 and 25 mug mL(-1), respectively. Cloning and sequence analysis of ketoacyl synthase (KS) gene revealed similarity to the type II polyketide synthase (PKS) gene of Streptomyces species.
TI  - Bacterial superinfection in zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Zoonotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ZCL) is a polymorphic disease. It is generally accepted that bacterial superinfection may play a role in the clinical appearance of the lesions and may delay or prevent the healing process. However, the pattern of bacterial pathogens involved has rarely been investigated. MATERIAL/METHODS: The aim of this study was to identify the bacterial species contaminating the suspected ZCL and their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics. Microscopic examination of stained smears and cultures were used to differentiate ZCL from non-ZCL lesions in a rural area north of Isfahan, Iran from July to December 2009. Bacteria were isolated from the lesions and identified and antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard microbiological techniques. RESULTS: The results show that 602 (68%) of 855 patients were positive for ZCL, of which 83.4% with volcano-shape, 8.8% psoriasiform, 6.6% popular form and 1.2% with other atypical forms of ZCL. The bacteria were isolated from 66.8% of ZCL (70% of volcano-shape, 60% of psoriasiform and 25% of popular form) and 64.7% of non-ZCL lesions. The most common species were Staphylococcus aureus (41.7%) and S. epidermidis (28%) followed by Bacillus sp. Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus sp., Enterobacter sp. and Pseudomonas aeroginosa. Ciprofloxacin, Erythromycin, Cefazolin and Clindamycin were the most effective antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial superinfection appears to be very common in ZCL, but its prevalence is not different from that of non-ZCL lesions and it has little effect on the clinical appearance of anthroponotic cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL). Local lesion care and management of bacterial superinfection must be considered in the treatment of ZCL.
TI  - Streptomyces ziwulingensis sp. nov., isolated from grassland soil.
AB  - A novel actinobacterium, designated strain F22(T), was isolated from grassland soil collected from the Ziwuling area on the Loess Plateau, China. The novel strain was found to have morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics typical of members of the genus Streptomyces. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain F22(T) belonged to the genus Streptomyces, being most closely related to Streptomyces resistomycificus NBRC 12814(T) (98.28 % sequence similarity), Streptomyces ciscaucasicus NBRC 12872(T) (98.14 %), Streptomyces chartreusis NBRC 12753(T) (98.14 %) and Streptomyces canus NRRL B-1989(T) (98.14 %). In DNA-DNA hybridizations and comparisons of morphological and phenotypic data, strain F22(T) could be distinguished from all of its closest phylogenetic relatives. Strain F22(T) exhibited antibacterial and antifungal activity, especially against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Cylindrocarpon destructans. Based on the DNA-DNA hybridization data and morphological, phenotypic and phylogenetic evidence, strain F22(T) represents a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces ziwulingensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is F22(T) ( = CCNWFX 0001(T) = JCM 18081(T) = ACCC41875(T)).
TI  - Gilvocarcin HE: a new polyketide glycoside from Streptomyces sp.
AB  - A new antimicrobial polyketide glycoside (1) and three known compounds, gilvocarcins H (2), V (3) and M (4) were isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of Streptomyces sp. QD01-2. The structure of (1) was established by spectroscopic analysis, X-ray single crystal diffraction and CD spectra. The new compound (1) showed potent antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans, with MIC values of 0.5-5.0 muM. Compound (1) also showed weak cytotoxicity against the MCF-7, K562 and P388 cell lines, with IC(50) values of 36, 39 and 45 muM, respectively. The results showed that the vinyl side chain helps to increase the cytotoxicity and antimicrobial activities of gilvocarcin-type glycosides. In addition, the NMR data of gilvocarcin H (2) were also reported for the first time.
TI  - [Diversity and antimicrobial activities of actinomycetes from pesticide-contaminated spots in Shandong Peninsula].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In order to study diversity and find antimicrobial activities of actinomycetes from pesticide-contaminated spots in Shandong Peninsula. METHODS: The phylogenetic analysis of 154 isolated strains was done based on 16SrDNA sequences. Antimicrobial activities of 10 non-Streptomyces strains were tested by using cylinder-plate method and hypha growth rate method. RESULTS: Among the strains, 154 strains belonged to 7 families, 8 genera: Streptomyces (87.01%), Kocuria, Microbacterium, Nocardiopsis, Knoellia, Pseudonocardia, Micromonospora, Actinoplanes. The fermentation broths of 10 non-Streptomyces strains had inhibitory actives against all tested phytopathogenic fungi (Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum, Gibberella zeae, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Colletotrichum gloesporioides) and bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtills, Bacillus cereus, Escherichai coli, Pseudomonas aeruginos) , especially Microbacterium oxydans JN853773 and Kocuria rosea JN192402 had strong inhibitory effects. CONCLUSION: Abundant diversity of actinomycetes existed in pesticide contaminated spots in Shandong Peninsula. Microbacterium oxydans JN853773 and Kocuria rosea JN192402 showed high antimicrobial activities and could be further exploited.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Pseudoalteromonas in the coral holobiont.
AB  - Corals harbor diverse and abundant prokaryotic populations. Bacterial communities residing in the coral mucus layer may be either pathogenic or symbiotic. Some species may produce antibiotics as a method of controlling populations of competing microbial species. The present study characterizes cultivable Pseudoalteromonas sp. isolated from the mucus layer of different coral species from the northern Gulf of Eilat, Red Sea, Israel. Six mucus-associated Pseudoalteromonas spp. obtained from different coral species were screened for antibacterial activity against 23 tester strains. Five of the six Pseudoalteromonas strains demonstrated extracellular antibacterial activity against Gram-positive-but not Gram-negative-tester strains. Active substances secreted into the cell-free supernatant are heat-tolerant and inhibit growth of Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and of ten endogenous Gram-positive marine bacteria isolated from corals. The Pseudoalteromonas spp. isolated from Red sea corals aligned in a phylogenetic tree with previously isolated Pseudoalteromonas spp. of marine origin that demonstrated antimicrobial activity. These results suggest that coral mucus-associated Pseudoalteromonas may play a protective role in the coral holobiont's defense against potential Gram-positive coral pathogens.
TI  - Microbiological analysis of stuffed mussels sold in the streets.
AB  - Stuffed mussel is a traditional food that sold by street venders in various countries. In the present study, samples of stuffed mussels were collected from various places in Ankara. The mussels were analyzed to show the microbiological risks for human health. Thirty samples (600 stuffed mussels in total) were collected periodically and microbiological analyses were performed by standard procedures for Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Clostridium sp. In terms of Salmonella sp., approximately 50% of samples were not suitable for consumption. Besides, in accordance with Turkish Food Codex Microbiological Criteria Announcement in terms of E. coli 30%, in terms of B. cereus 80%, in terms of S. aureus 76.6%, in terms of Clostridium perfringens 13.3% of these samples were not suitable for consumption. The aim of this study is to discuss the microbiological quality of stuffed mussels as a ready-to-eat food according to Turkish Food Codex (TFC). The result of this investigation indicates that stuffed mussels as a street food may constitute a potential health hazard, depending on contamination level and lack of sanitary practices, and therefore, handling practices should require more attention and improvement.

TI  - Antibiotic resistance and probiotic properties of dominant lactic microflora from Tungrymbai, an ethnic fermented soybean food of India.
AB  - The present investigation was conducted to assess lactic acid bacteria present in traditionally fermented food of ethnic tribes in India for probiotic properties, antibacterial activity, and antibiotic tolerance behavior. Enterococcus sp., Lactobacillus sp., and Lactococcus sp. showed antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus MTCC 430, Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus MTCC 740, and Salmonella enterica ser. paratyphi A MTCC 735. Lactococcus sp. and Lactobacillus sp. could tolerate acidic conditions (pH 2) and high bile salt concentration (4000 ppm). The lactic microflora were found to be sensitive to most common antibiotics, except for cloxacillin (5 mug), cephalexin (30 mug), and cephalothin (30 mug).
TI  - Identification of antimicrobial compound, diketopiperazines, from a Bacillus sp.  N strain associated with a rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode against major plant pathogenic fungi.
AB  - AIMS: To purify and characterize antimicrobial compounds from Bacillus sp. strain N associated with rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode (EPN). METHODS AND RESULTS: The cell-free culture filtrate of a bacterium associated with an EPN, Rhabditis (Oscheius) sp., exhibited strong antimicrobial activity. The ethyl acetate extract of the bacterial culture filtrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography to obtain three diketopiperazines (DKPs). The structure and absolute stereochemistry of this compound were determined based on extensive spectroscopic analyses (FABMS, (1) H NMR, (13) C NMR, (1) H-(1) H COSY, (1) H-(13) C HMBC) and Marfey's method. The compounds were identified as cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu), cyclo(d-Pro-l-Leu) and cyclo(d-Pro-l-Tyr), respectively. Three DKPs were active against all the five fungi tested (Aspergillus flavus, Candida albicans, Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizoctonia solani and Penicillium expansum) and are more effective than the standard fungicide bavistin. The highest activity of 4 mug ml(-1) by cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu) and cyclo(d-Pro-l-Tyr) was recorded against P. expansum, a plant pathogen responsible for causing postharvest decay of stored apples and oranges. Cyclo(d-Pro-l-Leu) recorded good antibacterial activity against all the four bacteria tested (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu) and cyclo(d-Pro-l-Tyr) recorded good activity only against Gram-positive bacteria. To our knowledge, this is the first report of antifungal activity of the DKPs against the plant pathogenic fungi F. oxysporum, R. solani and P. expansum. The production of cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu), cyclo(d-Pro-l-Leu) and cyclo-(d-Pro-l-Tyr) by a bacterium associated with EPN is also reported here for the first time. CONCLUSIONS: Isolated DKPs demonstrated high antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi, especially against plant pathogenic fungi. We conclude that the bacterium associated with EPN is a promising source of natural bioactive secondary metabolites which may receive great benefit in the field of agriculture. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study is a significant contribution to the knowledge of compounds unique from EPN bacteria as potential sources of new drugs in the agricultural and pharmacological industry.
TI  - The importance of being regular: Caenorhabditis elegans and Pristionchus pacificus defecation mutants are hypersusceptible to bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Bacterial pathogens have shaped the evolution and survival of organisms throughout history, but little is known about the evolution of virulence mechanisms and the counteracting defence strategies of host species. The nematode model organisms, Caenorhabditis elegans and Pristionchus pacificus, feed on a wealth of bacteria in their natural soil environment, some of which can cause mortality. Previously, we have shown that these nematodes differ in their susceptibility to a range of human and insect pathogenic bacteria, with P. pacificus showing extreme resistance compared with C. elegans. Here, we isolated 400 strains of Bacillus from soil samples and fed their spores to both nematodes. Spores of six Bacillus strains were found to kill C. elegans but not P. pacificus. While the majority of Bacillus strains are benign to nematodes, observed pathogenicity is restricted to either the spore or the vegetative stage. We used the rapid C. elegans killer strain (Bacillus sp. 142) to conduct a screen for hypersusceptible P. pacificus mutants. Two P. pacificus mutants with severe muscle defects and an extended defecation cycle that die rapidly on Bacillus spores were isolated. These genes were identified to be homologous to C. elegans, unc-22 and unc-13. To test whether a similar relationship between defecation and bacterial pathogenesis exists in C. elegans, we used five known defecation mutants. Quantification of the defecation cycle in mutants also revealed a severe effect on survival in C. elegans. Thus, intestinal peristalsis is critical to nematode health and contributes significantly to survival when fed Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Halogenated anthraquinones from the marine-derived fungus Aspergillus sp. SCSIO F063.
AB  - Metabolomic investigations focusing on the marine-derived fungus Aspergillus sp.  SCSIO F063 have unveiled seven new chlorinated anthraquinones (1-7) related to averantin, together with five known analogues (11-15) when the fungus was fermented using sea salt-containing potato dextrose broth. Through the addition of sodium bromide to the broth, two new brominated anthraquinones (8, 9) and one new nonhalogenated anthraquinone (10) were obtained from the fungal mycelia. Their structures were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analyses including MS and 1D and 2D NMR data. One metabolite, 6-O-methyl-7-chloroaveratin (2), displayed inhibition activity against three human tumor cell lines, SF-268, MCF-7, and NCI-H460, with IC(50) values of 7.11, 6.64, and 7.42 muM, respectively.
TI  - Paeciloside A, a new antimicrobial and cytotoxic polyketide from Paecilomyces sp. strain CAFT156.
AB  - Paeciloside A (1) and eight known compounds, acremoauxin A (2), farinosones A (3) and B (4), 1,5-dideoxy-3-C-methyl-arabitol (5), ergosterol, ergosterol peroxide, cerebroside C, and adenosine, were isolated from cultures of Paecilomyces sp. CAFT156, an endophytic fungus occurring in Enantia chlorantha Oliv (Annonaceae) leaves. The structure of the new compound 1 was elucidated using MS, UV, 1D and 2D NMR experiments, while its absolute configuration was established by subsequent single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis using copper Kalpha radiation and invariom nonspherical scattering factors. Paeciloside A (1) and compounds 2, 4, and 5 displayed inhibitory effects on two gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus at a concentration of 40 microg per paper disk and moderate cytotoxicity towards brine shrimp larvae (Artemia salina). This study presents the first report on an endophytic fungus isolated from E. chlorantha Oliv and its natural products.
TI  - Conjunctival microbial florae in patients with seriously sulfur mustard induced eye injuries.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ocular surface disorders and infections in sulfur mustard (SM) exposed patients are of particular clinical importance. The aim of the present study is to detect the conjunctival bacterial florae in patients with seriously SM induced eye injuries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Conjunctival bacterial florae of 143 seriously eye injured subjects as the study group was detected. The results were compared with 26 normal participants. Both groups were matched in age and sex. The samples were taken by sterile swab from interior fornixes of conjunctiva in both groups and were transported to microbiology laboratory by Stuart's Transport Medium. All samples were inoculated onto Blood agar, Mac Conkey agar and Chocolate agar and isolated microorganisms were identified by biochemical tests. The data were analyzed by SPSS and Man Whitney tests. RESULTS: Nineteen cases (13.39%) and none of the controls (0%) had positive culture results (p = .043). Isolated microorganisms from patients included coagulase-negative staphylococci 10 cases (52.6%), Staphylococcus aureus 5 cases (26.3%), non enterobacteriaceae gram negative bacilli 2 cases (10.5%), Penicillium spp. 2 cases (10.5%), Citrobacter sp. 1 case (5.2%), non-spore forming Gram positive bacillus 1 case (5.2%) and alpha hemolytic streptococcus 1 case (5.2%). Two patients had mixed microorganisms and other patients had just one microorganism. Most of the S. aureus isolates were sensitive to usual antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that the prevalence rate of conjunctival bacterial isolates in patients with seriously SM induced ocular injuries are higher and potentially more dangerous than normal controls.
TI  - Novel polymer anchored Cr(III) Schiff base complexes: synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial properties.
AB  - New polymer-bound Schiff bases and Cr(III) complexes have been synthesized by the reaction of 4-benzyloxybenzaldehyde, polymer-bound with 2-aminophenol, 2-amino-4-chlorophenol and 2-amino-4-methylphenol. The structure of polymeric-Schiff bases and their Cr(III) complexes have been characterized by elemental analyses, magnetic measurements, IR, UV-Vis, TG-DTA and (1)H-NMR. All these compounds have also been investigated for antibacterial activity by the well-diffusion method against Staphylococcus aureus (RSKK-07035), Shigella dysenteria type 10 (RSKK 1036), Listeria monocytogenes 4b(ATCC 19115, Escherichia coli (ATCC 1230), Salmonella typhi H (NCTC 901.8394), Staphylococcus epidermis (ATCC 12228), Brucella abortus (RSKK-03026), Micrococcs luteus (ATCC 93419, Bacillus cereus sp., Pseudomonas putida sp. and for antifungal activity against Candida albicans (Y-1200-NIH).
TI  - A novel thermotolerant and acidotolerant peptide produced by a Bacillus strain newly isolated from a fermented food (kimchi) shows activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria.
AB  - In an attempt to isolate effective antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) from a microbial source for the treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, BCP61 was purified from Bacillus sp. CS61 newly isolated from the traditional fermented food kimchi. BCP61 (ca. 1100 Da) was purified to homogeneity using sequential chromatographic steps. It was found to be stable at pH 2.0-10.0 and up to 80 degrees C. BCP61 displayed antimicrobial activity against MDR bacteria such as meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Minimal inhibitory concentrations of BCP61 for MRSA, VRSA and VRE were in the range 0.625-20mug/mL. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of BCP61 was A-I-N-X-D-A-A-Y-L, which differed from reported AMPs. The fourth unidentified amino acid was replaced and several peptides were synthesised. Among them, only cysteine replacement displayed antimicrobial activity. BCP61 from a food-borne strain may be useful in therapeutic applications.
TI  - Isolation of a bacteriocin-producing lactococcus lactis and application of its bacteriocin to manage spoilage bacteria in high-value marine fish under different storage temperatures.
AB  - The bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria have considerable potential for biopreservation. The Lactococcus lactis strain PSY2 (GenBank account no. JF703669) isolated from the surface of marine perch Perca flavescens produced antibacterial activity against pathogenic and spoilage-causing Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria viz. Arthrobacter sp., Acinetobacter sp., Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus and possessed broad inhibitory spectrum. The biopreservative efficacy of the bacteriocin PSY2 was evaluated using fillets of reef cod, Epinephelus diacanthus. The fillets (10 g) were sprayed with 2.0 ml of 1,600 AU/ml bacteriocin, wrapped and kept under different storage temperatures viz., 4, 0 and -18 degrees C. The biopreservative extended the shelf-life of fillets stored at 4 degrees C to >21 days as against <14 days observed in the untreated samples. The total count of spoilage bacteria was reduced by 2.5 logarithmic units in the treated sample during the 14th day of storage as against the control. Chemical analysis revealed a significant change (P < 0.05) in the pH value, free fatty acid (as % oleic acid), total volatile base nitrogen and total methyl amine content in the treated samples. The overall acceptability in terms of sensory attributes was significantly higher in the bacteriocin-treated samples stored for 21 days at 4 degrees C while the untreated samples became unacceptable by the 14th day. The biopreservative gave no significant effect at -18 degrees C. Thus, the bacteriocin derived from L. lactis PSY2 gave increased protection against spoilage bacteria and offers an alternative for the preservation of high-value sea foods.
TI  - Antibacterial anthraquinone derivatives from a sea anemone-derived fungus Nigrospora sp.
AB  - Chemical investigation of a marine-derived fungus Nigrospora sp., isolated from an unidentified sea anemone, yielded two new hydroanthraquinone analogues, 4a-epi-9alpha-methoxydihydrodeoxybostrycin (1) and 10-deoxybostrycin (2), together with seven known anthraquinone derivatives (3-9). The structures of the two new compounds were established through extensive NMR spectroscopy as well as a single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis using Cu Kalpha radiation. The antibacterial activities of compounds 1-9 and 10 acetyl derivatives (6a, 7a, 8a-8g, 9a) were evaluated in vitro. Compound 6a, the acetylated derivative of 6, exhibited promising activity against Bacillus cereus with an MIC value of 48.8 nM, which was stronger than that of the positive control ciprofloxacin (MIC = 1250 nM). Analysis of the antibacterial screening data for the metabolites and their acetyl derivatives revealed the key structural features required for this activity.
TI  - Characterization and antimicrobial activities of two Streptomyces isolates from soil in the periphery of Universiti Putra Malaysia.
AB  - This study was to assess the identification and antimicrobial activities of two actinomycete isolates. The two isolates designated as B8 and C2, were isolated from a patch of soil in the peripheral area of Universiti Putra Malaysia by streaking on starch casein agar after standard serial dilution procedures. Their antimicrobial activities were first evaluated against eight clinical laboratory strains namely Bacillus sp., Enterococcus sp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Pseudomonas sp., Salmonella sp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis by perpendicular streak method on Mueller Hinton and Tryptic Soy agar. In both media, a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity was observed for both isolates, with B8 against all the test bacteria and C2 against five of them (Bacillus sp., E. coli, Pseudomonas sp., S. aureus and S. epidermidis). Re-assessment against E. coli ATCC 25922 and S. aureus ATCC 25923 strains by similar method showed antibacterial activities by isolate B8 against both ATTC strains while C2 only against S. aureus ATCC 25923. Streptomyces griseus ATCC 10137 was included in the later experiment and showed antibacterial activity against both ATCC strains. Subsequently, the two isolates were identified by PCR/sequencing techniques and phylogenetic analysis to be Streptomyces species (>93% homology based on 16S rRNA and rpoB genes). Characterization on cultural characteristic and viable count at different temperatures (37 masculineC and 28 masculineC), on different microbiological media (AIA, ISP-2, MHA, NA, PDA and TSA), were performed. More morphological features were observed on ISP-2 for both isolates. A higher growth yield was also observed at 28 masculineC in all media but in comparing that between the two isolates, isolate B8 outnumbered C2 at all experimental conditions. The observed variation in cultural traits and growth yield indicate unique properties between the two antibiotic-producing isolates.
TI  - Detoxification of toxins by bacillithiol in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Bacillithiol (BSH), an alpha-anomeric glycoside of l-cysteinyl-d-glucosaminyl-l-malate, is a major low-molecular-mass thiol found in bacteria such as Bacillus sp., Staphylococcus aureus and Deinococcus radiodurans. Like other low-molecular-mass thiols such as glutathione and mycothiol, BSH is likely to be involved in protection against environmental toxins including thiol-reactive antibiotics. We report here a BSH-dependent detoxification mechanism in S. aureus. When S. aureus Newman strain was treated with monobromobimane and monochlorobimane, the cellular BSH was converted to the fluorescent S-conjugate BS-bimane. A bacillithiol conjugate amidase activity acted upon the BS-bimane to produce Cys-bimane, which was then acetylated by an N-acetyltransferase to generate N-acetyl-Cys-bimane, a mercapturic acid. An S. aureus mutant lacking BSH did not produce mercapturic acid when treated with monobromobimane and monochlorobimane, confirming the involvement of bacillithiol. Furthermore, treatment of S. aureus Newman with rifamycin, the parent compound of the first-line anti-tuberculosis drug, rifampicin, indicated that this thiol-reactive antibiotic is also detoxified in a BSH-dependent manner, since mercapturic acids of rifamycin were observed in the culture medium. These data indicate that toxins and thiol-reactive antibiotics are detoxified to less potent mercapturic acids in a BSH-dependent manner and then exported out of the cell in S. aureus.
TI  - Chromophenazines from the terrestrial Streptomyces sp. Ank 315.
AB  - The new chromophenazines A-F [9-methyl-5-(3'-methylbut-2'-enyl)-5H-benzo[a]phenazin-7-one (1a), 9-methyl-5-(3'-methylbut-2'-enyl)-7-oxo-5,7-dihydrobenzo[a]phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (1b), 5-(3'-methylbut-2'-enyl)-7-oxo-5,7-dihydrophenazine-1-carboxamide (2), 3-benzoyl-5-(3'-methylbut-2'-enyl)-5,10-dihydrophenazine-1-carboxylic acid (5a), 3,7-dibenzoyl-5-(3'-methylbut-2'-enyl)-5,10-dihydrophenazine-1-carboxylic acid (5b), and 3,7-dibenzoyl-5-(3'-methylbut-2'-enyl)-5,10-dihydrophenazine-1-carboxamide (5c)], together with phenazine-1-carboxylic acid, 1-phenazinecarboxamide, 1-phenazinol, tryptophol, and anthranilic acid, were isolated from Streptomyces sp. Ank 315. The structures of the new compounds were established on the basis of spectroscopic data, 1D NOE, 2D NMR, and ESIMS measurements and comparison with literature values.
TI  - A comparative characterization of indigenous keratinase enzymes from district Khairpur, Sindh, Pakistan.
AB  - To isolate and characterize keratinolytic fungi and bacteria from indigenous soils, a total of 80 samples were collected from Ghari Mori District. Khairpur, and these organisms were isolated using standard microbiological technique. The isolated keratinolytic microorganisms comprised: Absidia sp., Chrysosporium asperatum, Chrysosporium keratinophilum, Entomophthora coronata, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus and their keratinolytic properties were distinguished from the production of keratinase by measurement of zone of hydrolysis on skimmed milk agar (p<0.05). C.keratinophylum and B. subtilis produced largest zone among all the isolated species. The crude keratinase revealed that the optimum time for production of the enzyme was seven days, optimum temperature 30 degrees C and optimum pH 9 for C.keratinophylum but for B. subtilis, the optimum time was three days, optimum temperature 37 degrees C and optimum pH 7. The enzyme activity of C. keratinophylum and B. subtilis were determined to be 220 U/ml and 260 U/ml respectively (P<0.05).
TI  - Anti-bacterial studies on Hemigraphis colorata (Blume) H.G. Hallier and Elephantopus scaber L.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the ethanol, aqueous, chloroform, benzene, acetone and petroleum ether extracts of, Hemigraphis colorata (H. colorata) leaves and stem and Elephantopus scaber (E. scaber) leaves, root and flower for the presence of phyto-constituents and screened the anti-bacterial activity against the selected pathogens. METHODS: The fresh materials were shade dried and powdered using the tissue blender. The dried and powered materials (50 g) were extracted successively with 200 mL of aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether by using Soxhlet extractor for 8 h at a temperature not exceeding the boiling point of the solvent. Aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts were prepared from powdered materials were used for preliminary phytochemical and antimicrobial studies using standard methods. RESULTS: The crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts E. scaber leaves, flower and root and H. colorata leaves and stem demonstrated that out of (5x6x12 = 360) tests for the presence or absence of the above compounds, 188 tests gave positive results and the remaining 172 gave negative results. The results of the phytochemical screening revealed that phenol (12/12), carbohydrates (9/12), steroids (8/12), saponins and coumarins (7/12), tannins (6/12), proteins (5/12), carboxylic acid and flavonoids (4/12), xanthoproteins (3/12) and alkaloids (2/12) presence in the crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts of H. colorata leaves and stem. The crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts E. scaber leaves, flower and root displayed the presence of phenol (18/18), tannin (17/18), carbohydrates (16/18), steroids (14/18), carboxylic acid and coumarins (12/18), saponins (10/18), xanthoprotein (9/18), flavonoids (7/18), protein (4/18) and alkaloids (2/18). The root ethanolic extracts of E. scaber illustrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz., Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (24 mm), Escherichia coli (E. coli) (16 mm) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) (13 mm). The chlorofrom extracts of E. scaber showed the highest zone of inhibition against Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) (12 mm), The leaves ethanolic extracts of E. scaber demonstrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz., Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) (18 mm), Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) (17 mm), Salmonella Typhi (S. typhi) (14 mm) and Enterobacter sp. (11 mm) While the benzene extracts of H. colorata demonstrated maximum zone of inhibition against the pathogen Acinetobacter sp. (14 mm) and S. aureus (12 mm). CONCLUSIONS: It is hoped that this study would direct to the establishment of some compounds that could be used to invent new and more potent antimicrobial drugs of natural origin.
TI  - Chemical constituents of the methanolic extract of leaves of Leiothrix spiralis Ruhland and their antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Chemical fractionation of the methanolic extract of leaves of Leiothrix spiralis  Ruhland afforded the flavonoids luteolin-6-C-beta-D-glucopyranoside (1), 7-methoxyluteolin-6-C-beta-D-glucopyranoside (2), 7-methoxyluteolin-8-C-beta-D-glucopyranoside (3), 4'-methoxyluteolin-6-C-beta-D-glucopyranoside (4), and 6-hydroxy-7-methoxyluteolin (5), and the xanthones 8-carboxymethyl-1,5,6-trihydroxy-3-methoxyxanthone (6), 8-carboxy-methyl-1,3,5,6-tetrahydroxyxanthone (7). Methanolic extract, fractions, and isolated compounds of the leaves of L. spiralis were assayed against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella setubal and Helicobacter pylori) and fungi (the yeasts Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, C. krusei and C. parapsilosis). We observed the best minimum inhibitory concentration values for the methanolic extract against Candida parapsilosis, for the fraction 5 + 6 against Gram-negative bacteria E. coli and P. aeruginosa, and compound 7 against all tested Candida strains. The methanolic extract contents suggest that this species may be a promising source of compounds to produce natural phytomedicines.
TI  - Polyketides with antimicrobial activity from the solid culture of an endolichenic fungus Ulocladium sp.
AB  - Two new polyketides, 7-hydroxy-3, 5-dimethyl-isochromen-1-one (1) and 6-hydroxy-8-methoxy-3a-methyl-3a,9b-dihydro-3H-furo[3,2-c]isochromene-2,5-dione (2), along with eleven known compounds, 5'-methoxy-6-methyl-biphenyl-3,4,3'-triol (3), 7-hydroxy-3-(2-hydroxy-propyl)-5-methyl-isochromen-1-one (4), rubralactone (5), isoaltenuene (6), altenuene (7), dihydroaltenuenes A (8), altenusin (9), alterlactone (10), 6-O-methylnorlichexanthone (11), norlichexanthone (12), and griseoxanthone C (13) were isolated from the culture of the endolichenic fungus Ulocladium sp. Compound 2 was obtained as a racemate with an unprecedented chemical skeleton. The NMR data assignments for 3 and 4 were achieved for the first time. Compounds 1-13 were screened for their antimicrobial and radical scavenging activities. Compound 1 showed some antifungal activity against Candida albicans SC 5314 with IC(50) of 97.93 +/- 1.12 muM. Compounds 11-13 showed strong activity against Bacillus subtilis with IC(50) in the range of 1-5 muM. Compound 12 significantly inhibited the growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with IC(50) of 20.95 +/- 1.56 muM. Compounds 9 and 10 showed strong radical scavenging activity in comparison with vitamin C. The plausible biosynthetic pathways for compounds 1, 2, and 4-8 were discussed.
TI  - Characterization of a novel biosurfactant produced by Staphylococcus sp. strain 1E with potential application on hydrocarbon bioremediation.
AB  - A biosurfactant-producing bacterium (Staphylococcus sp. strain 1E) was isolated from an Algerian crude oil contaminated soil. Biosurfactant production was tested with different carbon sources using the surface tension measurement and the oil displacement test. Olive oil produced the highest reduction in surface tension (25.9 dynes cm(-1)). Crude oil presented the best substrate for 1E biosurfactant emulsification activity. The biosurfactant produced by strain 1E reduced the growth medium surface tension below 30 dynes cm(-1). This reduction was also obtained in cell-free filtrates. Biosurfactant produced by strain 1E showed stability in a wide range of pH (from 2 to 12), temperature (from 4 to 55 degrees C) and salinity (from 0 to 300 g l(-1)) variations. The biosurfactant produced by strain 1E belonged to lipopeptide group and also constituted an antibacterial activity againt the pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis. Phenanthrene solubility in water was enhanced by biosurfactant addition. Our results suggest that the 1E biosurfactant has interesting properties for its application in bioremediation of hydrocarbons contaminated sites.
TI  - A new sesquiterpene from endophytic fungus Aspergillus sp.
AB  - A fungal strain named YLF-14 was isolated from the leaf of Altingia yunnunensis.  Based on the sequence at the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, the strain was identified as an Aspergillus sp.. A new sesquiterpene 5beta,8abeta-dimethyl-3,4,4abeta,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalene-1,2,5alpha-trime thanol (1) and a known compound 12-N-methylcyclo-(L-tryptophyl-L-phenylalanyl) (2) were isolated from the culture of this strain. Bioassay experiments showed that the two compounds had no obvious effect on the growth of tested bacteria and nematodes.
TI  - Phytochemical constituents and antibacterial efficacy of the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum (DC.) Baker ex Heyne.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the preliminary phytochemistry and antibacterial activity of the flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum . METHODS: Phytochemical analysis was done by using the standard methods given by Harbone. The methanolic flower extract were tested against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Serratia marsecens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes by the agar disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Preliminary phytochemical screening of flower extract showed the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, tannins, xanthoproteins, carboxylic acids, coumarins and carbohydrates. The flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum showed significant activity against four gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes) and three gram negative bacteria (Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii and Serratia marsecens), out of 12 pathogenic bacteria studied. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study confirm the presence of significant antibacterial activity against human pathogens in the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum.
TI  - A newly isolated Streptomyces sp. CS392 producing three antimicrobial compounds.
AB  - With the aim of isolating new microbes capable of producing strong antimicrobial  substances, strain CS392 was screened from 700 soil isolates preserved in our laboratory. The strain was related to genus Streptomyces based on various characteristics. Three highly active antimicrobial compounds, C1, C2 and C3, produced by the strain were purified by solvent extraction followed by silica gel column chromatography. These compounds were highly active against various Gram-positive resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). Among three, C3 was the most active against MRSA and VRSA with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2 mug/ml while C2 and C3 had MIC values of 4 mug/ml for the strains. In case of Bacillus subtilis ATCC6633, C1 and C3 were more effective with MIC values of 0.5 mug/ml than C2 with MIC of 2 mug/ml. Those antibiotics were variably active (MIC of 4-32 mug/ml) against Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Mycobacterium smegmatis ATCC 9341 and VRE.
TI  - Pseudonocardians A-C, new diazaanthraquinone derivatives from a deap-sea actinomycete Pseudonocardia sp. SCSIO 01299.
AB  - Pseudonocardians A-C (2-4), three new diazaanthraquinone derivatives, along with  a previously synthesized compound deoxynyboquinone (1), were produced by the strain SCSIO 01299, a marine actinomycete member of the genus Pseudonocardia, isolated from deep-sea sediment of the South China Sea. The structures of compounds 1-4 were determined by mass spectrometry and NMR experiments ((1)H, (1)(3)C, HSQC, and HMBC). The structure of compound 1, which was obtained for the first time from a natural source, was confirmed by X-ray analysis. Compounds 1-3 exhibited potent cytotoxic activities against three tumor cell lines of SF-268, MCF-7 and NCI-H460 with IC(5)(0) values between 0.01 and 0.21 mum, and also showed antibacterial activities on Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Bacillus thuringensis SCSIO BT01, with MIC values of 1-4 mug mL(-)(1).
TI  - Diverse metabolic profiles of a Streptomyces strain isolated from a hyper-arid environment.
AB  - The metabolic profile of Streptomyces sp. strain C34, isolated from the Chilean hyper-arid Atacama Desert soil, is dependent on the culture media used for its growth. The application of an OSMAC approach on this strain using a range of cultivation media resulted in the isolation and identification of three new compounds from the rare class of 22-membered macrolactone polyketides, named chaxalactins A-C (1-3). In addition, the known compounds deferroxamine E (4), hygromycin A (5), and 5''-dihydrohygromycin A (6) were detected. The isolated compounds were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and accurate mass spectrometric analysis. Compounds 1-3 displayed strong activity against Gram-positive but weak activity Gram-negative strains tested.
TI  - Hygienic quality and antibiotic resistance profile of sliced butchery.
AB  - In order to investigate the microbiological quality of different meat products on the Greek market, 200 samples were collected from the following preparations: boiled turkey (n=50), boiled pork ham (n=50), smoked turkey (n=50) and smoked pork ham (n=50). In all cold meat preparations Clostridium perfringens vegetative and spore forms, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and other Clostridium sp lec(-), as well as Lactobacillus, Bacillus sp. and Salmonella sp. were recovered. For instance Bacillus cereus was present in 6% of the samples. L. monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli were rarely present (1-4%) while Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter lari were absent. Differences in the occurrence of S. aureus, Salmonella sp., E. coli and spore forms of C. perfringens in boiled and smoked samples, reflects either the differences in the processing of the foods or could be associated to the extensive handling by the personnel during the purchasing (storage, slicing, wrapping). Antibiotic resistance on specific antibiotics for each pathogen was also studied. A multiresistance antibiotic profile was effective for most bacterial strains, and pronounced resistance profiles were observed for the commonly used antibiotics as ampicillin, penicillin, cephalothin, streptomycin followed by ceftriaxone and gentamycin. Albeit this high observed resistance profile, the tested strains generally conserved their susceptibility to amikacin, aztreonam, chloramphenicol and tylosin conserved an almost absent resistance. Antibiotics commonly used for therapeutic purposes, as well as antibiotics added to feed stuff of animals for increasing animal flesh production should contribute to the extensive spreading of antibiotic resistance in food and the environment. Systematically monitoring of the microbiological quality of cold butchery preparations must be done, in order to preserve food quality, optimizing the processing and elaboration methods of the product and safeguard the public health.
TI  - cis-antisense RNA, another level of gene regulation in bacteria.
AB  - A substantial amount of antisense transcription is a hallmark of gene expression  in eukaryotes. However, antisense transcription was first demonstrated in bacteria almost 50 years ago. The transcriptomes of bacteria as different as Helicobacter pylori, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Sinorhizobium meliloti, Geobacter sulfurreducens, Vibrio cholerae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Pseudomonas syringae, and Staphylococcus aureus have now been reported to contain antisense RNA (asRNA) transcripts for a high percentage of genes. Bacterial asRNAs share functional similarities with trans-acting regulatory RNAs, but in addition, they use their own distinct mechanisms. Among their confirmed functional roles are transcription termination, codegradation, control of translation, transcriptional interference, and enhanced stability of their respective target transcripts. Here, we review recent publications indicating that asRNAs occur as frequently in simple unicellular bacteria as they do in higher organisms, and we provide a comprehensive overview of the experimentally confirmed characteristics of asRNA actions and intimately linked quantitative aspects. Emerging functional data suggest that asRNAs in bacteria mediate a plethora of effects and are involved in far more processes than were previously anticipated. Thus, the functional impact of asRNAs should be considered when developing new strategies against pathogenic bacteria and when optimizing bacterial strains for biotechnology.
TI  - Phytochemical analysis and antimicrobial activities of methanolic extracts of leaf, stem and root from different varieties of Labisa pumila Benth.
AB  - A local herb, Kacip Fatimah, is famous amongst Malay women for its uses in parturition; however, its phytochemical contents have not been fully documented. Therefore, a study was performed to evaluate the phenolics, flavonoids, and total saponin contents, and antibacterial and antifungal properties of the leaf, stem and root of three varieties of Labisia pumila Benth. Total saponins were found to be higher in the leaves of all three varieties, compared to the roots and stems. Leaves of var. pumila exhibited significantly higher total saponin content than var. alata and lanceolata, with values of 56.4, 43.6 and 42.3 mg diosgenin equivalent/g dry weight, respectively. HPLC analyses of phenolics and flavonoids in all three varieties revealed the presence of gallic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, and myricetin in all plant parts. Higher levels of flavonoids (rutin, quercitin, kaempferol) were observed in var. pumila compared with alata and lanceolata, whereas higher accumulation of phenolics (gallic acid, pyrogallol) was recorded in var. alata, followed by pumila and lanceolata. Antibacterial activities of leaf, stem and root extracts of all varieties determined against both Gram positive (Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis B145, Bacillus cereus B43, Staphylococcus aureus S1431) and Gram negative (Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumonia K36, Escherichia coli E256, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PI96) pathogens showed that crude methanolic extracts are active against these bacteria at low concentrations, albeit with lower antibacterial activity compared to kanamycin used as the control. Antifungal activity of methanolic extracts of all plant parts against Fusarium sp., Candida sp. and Mucor using the agar diffusion disc exhibited moderate to appreciable antifungal activities compared to streptomycin used as positive control.
TI  - Isolation of microbial pathogens of subclinical mastitis from raw sheep's milk of Epirus (Greece) and their role in its hygiene.
AB  - The natural raw milk microflora is a factor that expresses its sensorial characteristics. The microbial charge into the mammary gland of healthy animal is low and the application of right and healthy conditions during milking and cheese making procedure, prevents from contaminating as well as maintains the natural microflora in order to lend the particular characteristics of milk. The purpose of the present project was the study of the Total Viable Count (T.V.C.) and the count of total psychrotropic bacteria of raw sheep milk from Boutsiko and Karamaniko breeds, collected from healthy animals, as well as the isolation, identification and enumeration of pathogenic bacteria related with the hygiene and the quality of raw sheep milk (with a particular interest in bacteria that may cause human infection). During the experiment we examined two hundred forty (240) samples of raw sheep milk. In these samples a) Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella sp., Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens (vegetative cells and spores) and Bacillus sp. were isolated and identified b) the Total Viable Count and the total number of psychrotropic bacteria were also specified. The sampling, the preparation of samples and decimal dilutions were based on international methods. The Total viable count was determined using the standard methods of the American Public Health Association, 2002. The total number of psychrotropic bacteria was determined using APHA 1976, 1978 rules. The identification of the bacteria was carried out according to the Bergey's manual. Microscopic examination of Gram stained cells, catalase, oxidase and biochemical tests were performed when necessary to further identify. From the 240 milk samples tested, only 5% were E. coli positive, with mean counts ranged from 2 x 10(3) to 2.4 x 10(4) cfu/ml. S. aureus was isolated from 24% of the samples and the mean count per ml was ranged from <10 to 3.4 x 10(2). Meanwhile, Bacillus spp. was also detected in 29% samples. Vegetative forms and spores of C. perfringens were detected in 13% and 63% of the samples respectively. However, microbiological analyses revealed the presence of a small number of selected pathogens in milk samples such as Salmonella, which was only detected in 5% of the samples. Listeria sp., Pseudomonas sp. and Vibrio cholerae were never found. From the experimental results, the Total Viable Count from raw sheep milk samples, fulfils the microbiological criteria of EU Legislation in a percentage of approximately 97%.
TI  - [The microflora associated with anatomical embalming as a harmful factor of a working process].
AB  - The paper describes the first attempt to isolate and identify the microbiocenosis associated with the objects of a morphological laboratory that uses formalin. The study identified the following microorganisms: the bacteria Bacillus sp., Providencia alcalifaciens, and Staphylococcus aureus, the micromycetes Scopulariopsis brevicaulis, Aspergillus sp., Hormodendron sp., and the mites Dermatophagoides pterronissimus. There is experimental evidence that these organisms are resistant to formalin. The representatives of this cenosis can negatively affect the health of the workers, which requires the development of the optimal technologies of biomaterial fixation.
TI  - Microbial ecology of fish species ongrowing in Greek sea farms and their watery environment.
AB  - The present study focuses on the bacteriological profile of both watery ecosystem and fishes from different North and Central West Greek fish-farms ongrowing euryhaline fish species. The natural microflora of the fish and the water of their ongrowing units in selected farms were studied for a period of 20 months. The analyzed samples were mainly sea bream (Sparus aurata) 61.3% and sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) 24%. In most of the watery ecosystems coming from the different sampling areas, total and fecal coliforms as well as total and fecal streptococci were abundant in all water samples. Enterococcus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas were present at a level of 3 logs cfu/100 ml. The anaerobic Clostridium perfringens was found in vegetative (21.3%) and spore forms (13.3%). It is of interest to note that pathogens as Pasteurella piscicida and Vibrio anguillarum were isolated only in a small number of samples. Staphylococcus aureus was detected in 4% of the samples, other Staphylococcus sp. in 29.3%, E. coli in 30.7%, Salmonella sp. in 1.3%, Pseudomonas sp. in 13.3%, Clostridia lec(-) in 49.3%, Bacillus sp. in 38.7%, Vibrio sp. in 18.7%, Lactobacillus and Lactococcus sp. in 36% kappaalphaiota 29.3% respectively. Vegetative forms of C. perfringens were detected in 22.7%. Although, our results showed no significant correlations between the sea water and fish microflora, more focus on this bipolar interacting system should be necessary in order to avoid any possible disturbance in the balance of the healthy farming ecosystem with the host organisms.
TI  - Antitumour compounds from a saline soil isolate, Streptomyces griseoincarnatus CTF15.
AB  - A new actinomycete strain designated as Streptomyces sp. CTF15 was isolated from  a saline soil using casein-KNO(3) agar medium. The strain Streptomyces sp. CTF15 exhibited promising antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Streptomyces viridochromogens Tu57 and high cytotoxicity (91.2% mortality) against Artimia salina in biological screening. The cultivation of this strain in a 50 L lab fermenter and subsequent isolation and purification by a series of chromatographic techniques and structure elucidation by MS and NMR analysis of the active metabolites revealed that it is a highly stable producer of resistomycin (1), tetracenomycin D (2) and actinomycin D (3), even under non-optimised culture conditions. The morphological, microscopic, biochemical and physiological characterisation suggested that the strain CTF15 belongs to the genus Streptomyces. A partial 16S rRNA gene sequence (1429 bp) from the strain CTF15 was determined and found to have high identity (99%) with Streptomyces griseoincarnatus. As such, this is the first report of a strain of S. griseoincarnatus capable of producing these three bioactive compounds simultaneously.
TI  - Maklamicin, an antibacterial polyketide from an endophytic Micromonospora sp.
AB  - A new spirotetronate-class polyketide, maklamicin (1), was isolated from the culture extract of an endophytic actinomycete of the genus Micromonospora. The structure and relative configuration of 1 were elucidated by interpretation of NMR and other spectroscopic data, and the absolute configuration was determined using the modified Mosher method. Maklamicin (1) showed strong to modest antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Effectiveness of 2% peracetic acid for the disinfection of gutta-percha cones.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of 2% peracetic acid for  the disinfection of gutta-percha cones contaminated in vitro with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans and Bacillus subtilus (in spore form). Two hundred and twenty-five gutta-percha cones were contaminated with standardized suspensions of each microorganism and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The cones were divided into 10 experimental groups (n = 15), according to the microorganism tested and disinfection testing times. The disinfection procedure consisted of immersing each cone in a plastic tube containing the substance. The specimens remained in contact with the substance for 1 or 2.5 minutes. Afterwards, each cone was transferred to a 10% sodium thiosulphate solution (Na(2)S(2)O(3)) to neutralize the disinfectant. Microbial biofilms adhering to the cones were dispersed by agitation. Aliquots of 0.1 ml of the suspensions obtained were plated on Sabouraud dextrose agar, or brain and heart infusion agar, and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The results were expressed in colony forming units (CFU/ml) and the data were submitted to the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test (level of significance at 0.05). A significant reduction was observed, after 1 minute of exposure, in the test solution for C. albicans (p = 0.0190), S. aureus (p = 0.0001), S. mutans (p = 0.0001), B. subtilis (p = 0.0001), and E. coli (p = 0.0001). After 2.5 minutes of exposure, 100% of the microbial inocula were eliminated. It was concluded that the 2% peracetic acid solution was effective against the biofilms of the tested microorganisms on gutta-percha cones at 1 minute of exposure.
TI  - Scalarane sesterterpenes from the sponge Hyatella sp.
AB  - Five new sesterterpenes (7-11) along with six known compounds (1-6) were isolated from the sponge Hyatella sp., collected off the coast of Soheuksan-do, Korea. Spectroscopic analyses revealed these compounds as scalarane sesterterpenes with oxidized furan moieties (7-10) and a corresponding lactam (11). The compounds exhibited moderate cytotoxicity, antibacterial activity, and weak inhibitory activity against isocitrate lyase.
TI  - Akara Ogbomoso: microbiological examination and identification of hazards and critical control points.
AB  - Akara Ogbomoso was examined toward the establishment of hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP). The akara was produced in residential buildings with the attendant consequence of contamination. There was ample growth of aerobes, coliforms, staphylococci, Shigella and yeast/mold from the samples, water and cowpea pastes. Microbial contaminations occur through the processing, which can be corrected through education by adopting good hygienic and manufacturing practices. The critical control points were identified as frying, storage and refrying. It may be heated in the microwave for 10 s before consumption. Akara, prepared in the laboratory through the implementation of HACCP was not contaminated. Several bacterial isolates, namely; Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus sp. and Shigella sp., showed multiple resistance to antibiotics ranging from two to nine. Seven strains were not resistant to the antibiotics, while five were resistant to one type of antibiotic.
TI  - Synthesis, stereochemistry, antimicrobial evaluation and QSAR studies of 2,6-diaryltetrahydropyran-4-one thiosemicarbazones.
AB  - A series of 2,6-diaryltetrahydropyran-4-one thiosemicarbazones (11-27) were synthesized and characterized for evaluation of potential antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Bacillus subtilis and Klebsiella pneumonia and antifungal activity against Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans, Rhizopus sp., Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus flavus were evaluated. Compounds 21 and 22 showed maximum inhibition potency at low concentration (6.25 mug/ml) against P. aeruginosa. For antifungal activity, 20 and 21 were effective against C. neoformans and 22-24 against C. albicans at minimum concentration. Further, the results of QSAR studies of these synthesized compounds indicated the importance of weakly polar component of surface area, hydrophobicity and ionization potential parameters in defining their antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Phomalevones A-C: dimeric and pseudodimeric polyketides from a fungicolous Hawaiian isolate of Phoma sp. (Cucurbitariaceae).
AB  - Phomalevones A-C (1-3), three new com-pounds with bis-dihydroxanthone and bis-benzophenone systems, were isolated from cultures of a Hawaiian isolate of Phoma sp. (MYC-1734 = NRRL 39060; Cucurbitariaceae). The structures of 1-3 were determined by analysis of NMR and MS data. The absolute configurations of the sp(3) stereocenters in the monomeric unit of 1 were assigned by application of Mosher's method, and overall absolute configurations were proposed on the basis of ECD data using both computational methods and comparisons with literature data for model compounds. All three compounds showed antibacterial activity, and compounds 2 and 3 also exhibited antifungal effects.
TI  - Identification of Streptomyces sp. KH29, which produces an antibiotic substance processing an inhibitory activity against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - The Actinomycete strain KH29 is antagonistic to the multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Based on the diaminopimelic acid (DAP) type, and the morphological and physiological characteristics observed through the use of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), KH29 was confirmed as belonging to the genus Streptomyces. By way of its noted 16S rDNA nucleotide sequences, KH29 was found to have a relationship with Streptomyces cinnamonensis. The production of an antibiotic from this strain was found to be most favorable when cultured with glucose, polypeptone, and yeast extract (PY) medium for 6 days at 27 degrees C. The antibiotic produced was identified, through comparisons with reported spectral data including MS and NMR as a cyclo(L-tryptophanyl-L-tryptophanyl). Cyclo(L-Trp-L-Trp), from the PY cultures of KH29, was seen to be highly effective against 41 of 49 multidrugresistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Furthermore, cyclo(LTrp- L-Trp) had antimicrobial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus niger, and Candida albicans, However, it was ineffective against Streptomyces murinus.
TI  - The antimicrobial activities of processed Nigerian and South African black tea.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of processed Nigerian Lipton Tea and South African 5 Roses Tea, extracted using distilled water, chloroform and 70% ethanol were determined against nine (9) enteropathogenic bacteria which includes; Bacillus subtilis, Proteus sp, Enterobacter sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi A, Salmonella arizona and Staphylococcus aureus. The 2 tea bags, Nigerian Lipton tea bag and the South African 5 Roses tea bag were extracted through Solvent extraction method using 3 extraction solvents; Distilled water, Chloroform and 70% Ethanol and then inoculated onto the Mueller-Hinton agar plates containing the standard isolates at 6 different points on each plate. The zones of inhibition of the bacterial isolates produced by each of these tea - extracts were determined while meaningful antibacterial activities against five (5) of the standard isolates; Enterobacter sp., K. pneumoniae, S. paratyphi A, B. subtilis and S. aureus were observed. Lipton tea water-extract was a more effective antibacterial agent than water-extract of 5 Roses tea. While the 70% ethanol-extract of 5 Roses tea had the greatest antibacterial activity of all the different tea-extract used for the study, the chloroform-extracts of the tea bags had no antimicrobial effect on all the test organisms used.
TI  - Abyssomicin I, a modified polycyclic polyketide from Streptomyces sp. CHI39.
AB  - Abyssomicin I (1), a new modified polycyclic polyketide, was isolated from the culture extract of a soil-derived Streptomyces sp. The structure of 1 was elucidated by interpretation of NMR and other spectroscopic data. The stereochemistry of the new compound was assigned by NOE analysis, chemical derivatization, and application of the modified Mosher method. While 1 was inactive against bacteria and yeasts, the oxidized derivative 7 showed weak activities against gram-positive bacteria. Compounds 1 and 7 exhibited inhibitory effects on tumor cell invasion with IC(50) values of 11 and 0.21 muM, respectively.
TI  - Bacillus subtilis CwlP of the SP-{beta} prophage has two novel peptidoglycan hydrolase domains, muramidase and cross-linkage digesting DD-endopeptidase.
AB  - For bacteria and bacteriophages, cell wall digestion by hydrolases is a very important event. We investigated one of the proteins involved in cell wall digestion, the yomI gene product (renamed CwlP). The gene is located in the SP-beta prophage region of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome. Inspection of the Pfam database indicates that CwlP contains soluble lytic transglycosylase (SLT) and peptidase M23 domains, which are similar to Escherichia coli lytic transglycosylase Slt70, and the Staphylococcus aureus Gly-Gly endopeptidase LytM, respectively. The SLT domain of CwlP exhibits hydrolytic activity toward the B. subtilis cell wall; however, reverse phase (RP)-HPLC and mass spectrometry revealed that the CwlP-SLT domain has only muramidase activity. In addition, the peptidase M23 domain of CwlP exhibited hydrolytic activity and could cleave d-Ala-diaminopimelic acid cross-linkage, a property associated with dd-endopeptidases. Remarkably, the M23 domain of CwlP possessed a unique Zn(2+)-independent endopeptidase activity; this contrasts with all other characterized M23 peptidases (and enzymes similar to CwlP), which are Zn(2+) dependent. Both domains of CwlP could hydrolyze the peptidoglycan and cell wall of B. subtilis. However, the M23 domain digested neither the peptidoglycans nor the cell walls of S. aureus or Streptococcus thermophilus. The effect of defined point mutations in conserved amino acid residues of CwlP is also determined.
TI  - Heronapyrroles A-C: farnesylated 2-nitropyrroles from an Australian marine-derived Streptomyces sp.
AB  - Chemical analysis of a marine-derived Streptomyces sp. (CMB-M0423) isolated from  beach sand off Heron Island, Australia, yielded three new members of the rare pyrroloterpene biosynthetic structure class. Identified by detailed spectroscopic analysis as the first reported examples of naturally occurring 2-nitropyrroles, heronapyrroles A-C (1-3) displayed promising biological activity-with low to submicromolar IC(50) activity against Gram-positive bacteria but no cytotoxicity toward mammalian cell lines.
TI  - Volatile components of selected liverworts, and cytotoxic, radical scavenging and antimicrobial activities of their crude extracts.
AB  - Crude extracts of the Tahitian liverworts Mastigophora diclados and Frullania sp., the Indonesian Frullania sp., Dumortiera hirsuta and Marchantia sp., and the Japanese Porella perrottetiana were investigated chemically by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). All extracts contained various volatile sesqui- and diterpenoids and a few aromatic compounds. The Tahitian M. diclados and Frullania sp., and the Indonesian Frullania sp. exhibited cytotoxic activity against HL-60 and KB cell lines. The extracts of the Tahitian M. diclados and the Indonesian Marchantia sp. showed radical scavenging activity, whereas the crude extracts of the Tahitian M. diclados and Frullania sp., and the Indonesian Frullania and Marchantia sp. showed antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization, spectrophotometric, structural and antimicrobial studies of the newly charge transfer complex of p-phenylenediamine with pi acceptor picric acid.
AB  - Charge transfer complex (CTC) of donor, p-phenylenediamine (PPD) and acceptor, 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (picric acid) has been studied in methanol at room temperature. The CT complex was synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR spectra, 1H NMR spectroscopy and electronic absorption spectra which indicate the CT interaction associated with proton migration from the acceptor to the donor followed by hydrogen bonding via N+-Hcdots, three dots, centeredO-. The thermal stability of CT complex was studied using TGA and DTA analyses techniques. The CT complex was screened for its antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger (Laboratory isolate), Candida albicans (IQA-109) and Penicillium sp. (Laboratory isolate) and antibacterial activity against two Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA 22) and Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6051) and two Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli (K 12) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MTCC 2488). It gives good antimicrobial activity. The stoichiometry of the CT complex was found to be 1:1. The physical parameters of CT complex were evaluated by the Benesi-Hildebrand equation. On the basis of the studies, the structure of CT complex is [(PPDH)+(PA)-], and a general mechanism for its formation is proposed.
TI  - Isolation of culturable microorganisms from free-ranging bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from the southeastern United States.
AB  - Reports of diseases in marine mammals are increasing worldwide, however our understanding of the microorganisms associated with marine mammals is still limited. In this study, we cultured bacteria and fungi isolated from the upper respiratory tract (blowhole), gastric fluid and anus of 180 wild bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from two estuarine locations along the southeastern Atlantic Coast of the United States. A total of 339 and 491 isolates from Charleston, SC (CHS) and Indian River Lagoon, FL (IRL) dolphins, respectively, were cultured from gastric (70 CHS/82 IRL), fecal (141 CHS/184 IRL), and blowhole (128 CHS/225 IRL) swabs on selective media used for routine clinical microorganisms of human concern. The most frequently cultured Gram-negative bacteria from all sample and study types were Plesiomonas shigelloides, Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas fluorescens. Among the Gram-positive bacteria, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus sp., and Staphylococcus Coag. Neg were the predominant organisms. For fungi, the most abundant species were Candida glabrata, budding yeasts, and Candida tropicalis. Of concern, the MRSA strain of Staphylococcus aureus was detected in the blowhole and gastric swabs from CHS dolphins. In general, a greater prevalence of bacteria and fungi (four-fold increase) were cultured from IRL than CHS animals. Together, these culture-dependent studies, coupled to on-going culture-independent approaches, should help establish a baseline of microorganisms associated with bottlenose dolphins and aid in the identification of organisms responsible for infectious diseases(s) in these animals.
TI  - Assessment of Euphorbia hirta L. leaf, flower, stem and root extracts for their antibacterial and antifungal activity and brine shrimp lethality.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of the methanolic extracts of Euphorbia hirta L leaves, flowers, stems and roots were evaluated against some medically important bacteria and yeast using the agar disc diffusion method. Four Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus sp., Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus thuringensis), four Gram negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Salmonella typhi and P. mirabilis) and one yeast (Candida albicans) species were screened. Inhibition zones ranged between 16-29 mm. Leaves extract inhibited the growth of all tested microorganisms with large zones of inhibition, followed by that of flowers, which also inhibited all the bacteria except C. albicans. The most susceptible microbes to all extracts were S. aureus and Micrococcus sp. Root extract displayed larger inhibition zones against Gram positive bacteria than Gram negative bacteria and had larger inhibition zones compared to stem extract. The lowest MIC values were obtained with E. coli and C. albicans (3.12 mg/mL), followed by S. aureus (12.50 mg/mL) and P. mirabilis (50.00 mg/mL). All the other bacteria had MIC values of 100.00 mg/mL. Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) studies revealed that the cells exposed to leaf extract displayed a rough surface with multiple blends and invaginations which increased with increasing time of treatment, and cells exposed to leaf extract for 36 h showed the most damage, with abundant surface cracks which may be related to final cell collapse and loss of function. Time-kill assay of C. albicans indicated a primarily fungicidal effect at 1- and 2-fold MIC. E. hirta extracts had LC(50) values of 0.71, 0.66, 0.41 and 0.03 mg/mL for stems, leaves, roots and flowers, respectively against Artemia salina. Hence, these plants can be used to discover new bioactive natural products that may serve as leads in the development of new pharmaceuticals.
TI  - Diversity and antimicrobial activity of endophytic fungi associated with the alpine plant Saussurea involucrata.
AB  - Endophytic fungi are rich in species diversity and may play an important role in  the fitness of their host plants. This study investigated the diversity and antimicrobial potential of endophytic fungi obtained from Saussurea involucrata KAR. et KIR. A total of 49 endophytic fungi were isolated from S. involucrata and identified using morphological and molecular techniques. Extracts of fermentation broth from the 49 fungi were tested for antimicrobial activity against pathogenic microorganisms using the agar diffusion method. Forty-eight out of the 49 endophytic fungi were identified and grouped into 14 taxa. Cylindrocarpon sp. was the dominant species isolated from S. involucrata, followed by Phoma sp. and Fusarium sp. Among the 49 endophytic fungi, 9 root isolates having darkly pigmented, septate hyphae were identified as dark septate endophytic (DSE) fungus, and 12 fungi inhibited at least one test microorganism. Moreover, 5 strains showed a broader spectrum of antimicrobial activity and 4 strains displayed strong inhibition (+++) against pathogenic fungi. The results indicate that endophytic fungi isolated from S. involucrata are diverse in species and a potential source of antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Synthesis, solvatochromaticity and bioactivities of some transition metal complexes with 2-(R-benzylideneamino)-pyridin-3-ol Schiff base derivatives.
AB  - New four Schiff bases are prepared by condensation of 2-amino-pyridin-3-ol with 3, 4-dihydroxy-benzaldehyde (I), 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (II), 5-bromo-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (III), and 4-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde (IV). The structures of these compounds are characterized based on elemental analyses (C. H. N), IR and (1)H NMR. Also, the electronic absorption spectra are recorded in organic solvents of different polarity. The solvents are selected to be covered a wide range of parameters (refractive index, dielectric constant and hydrogen bonding capacity). The UV-vis absorption spectra of Schiff base compounds are investigated in aqueous buffer solutions of varying pH and utilized for the determination of ionization constant, pK(a) and activation free energy, DeltaG(*) of the ionization process. The biological activity against bacterial species and fungi as microorganisms representing different microbial categories such as (two Gram-negative bacteria, Eschericha coli and Agrobacterium sp.),three Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtlus and Bacillus megatherium), yeast (Candida albicans), and fungi (Aspergillus niger) were studied.
TI  - Isolation, structure determination and antibacterial activities of succinamide conjugate diacid from Acinetobacter sp. BJ-L.
AB  - Strain BJ-L was isolated from the a water sample taken from Xiao Yue River in Beijing and identified as Acinetobacter sp. BJ-L based on the study of its morphology, physiology, biochemistry and 16S rRNA gene sequence. A new antimicrobial substance was produced after the strain was incubated in potato extract medium at 15 degrees C for 72 h. The antimicrobial substance was sequentially purified by reduced pressure condensation, EtOAc extract, and silica gel column chromatography. The structure of the antimicrobial substance was elucidated as succinamide conjugate diacid (SCD) by spectroscopic data interpretation. Structure analysis indicated that SCD is a novel compound and that it could inhibit the growth of some tested bacterial strains with the MIC of 2mg/ml, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli. Moreover, no obvious toxicity has been found on cultured HUVEC cells with different concentrations of SCD at 5, 10, 15, and 20mg/ml.
TI  - Production of antimicrobial silver nanoparticles in water extracts of the fungus  Amylomyces rouxii strain KSU-09.
AB  - A fungal strain, KSU-09, isolated from the roots of date palm (Phoenix dactylifera), was identified as Amylomyces rouxii based on sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of its rRNA genes. Mycelia-free water extracts obtained from mycelium suspended in water for 72h facilitated the production of stable, predominantly monodispersed and spherical silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the size range of 5-27nm upon addition of 1mM silver nitrate, as determined by the XRD, AFM and TEM. The AgNPs exhibited antimicrobial activity against Shigella dysenteriae type I, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans and Fusarium oxysporum. Thus, the strain KSU-09 could be used for simple, non-hazardous and efficient synthesis of antimicrobial AgNPs.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of prunin, a citric flavanone glucoside, and its prunin  6''-O-lauroyl ester.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the antimicrobial potential of prunin (P), a flavanone glucoside resulting from the hydrolysis of naringin present in grapefruit, and of its prunin 6''-O-lauroyl ester (PL), synthesized by enzymatic catalysis. METHODS AND RESULTS: P and its lauroyl ester were tested against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, yeasts and moulds. P showed no inhibitory effect against the micro-organisms assayed, but stimulated growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and different Bacilllus sp. However, 150 mug ml(-1) of PL inhibited Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, many Bacillus sp., Staphylococcus aureus ATCC29213, Enterococcus avium DSMZ17511, and different Listeria monocytogenes strains. In the last case, L. monocytogenes, sensitive or bacteriocin-resistant cells, lost nearly 4-log reductions after 30 min of contact. A bactericidal mode of action was determined using both scanning and transmission electronic microscopies. CONCLUSIONS: PL could be used as a food additive, because at low concentration (150 mug ml(-1)) it exhibited antimicrobial activity against important food-borne pathogens. A bactericidal effect was also determined on L. monocytogenes sensitive and bacteriocin-resistant mutant strains. P did not show any antimicrobial property at all. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: PL is a potential antimicrobial compound with a high anti-Listeria property.
TI  - Defensin of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha): molecular structure, in vitro expression, antimicrobial activity, and potential functions.
AB  - A 409 bp full length defensin gene was cloned and sequenced based on an expressed sequence tag (EST) obtained from a normalized zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) foot cDNA library developed in our laboratory. The D. polymorpha defensin (Dpd) gene encoded a peptide with 76 amino acid residues. The mature Dpd contains 54 amino acids with a fully functional insect defensin A domain. Homologue searching against GenBank database suggested that this Dpd was phylogenetically close to defensins from a group of insects with six conserved cysteine residues. Predicted with homology-modeling method, the three-dimensional structure of Dpd also demonstrated a significant similarity with insect defensin A. The recombinant Dpd was in vitro expressed through an Escherichia coli expression system. The antimicrobial activities of the refolded recombinant Dpd were found against the growth of Morganella sp., Plesiomonas shigelloides, Edwardsiella tarda, E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus aureus (ATCC12598) with the minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) 0.35, 0.43, 1.16, 6.46, and 30.39 microM, respectively. However, with less than 50 microM no detectable inhibition activities were observed against the other four Gram-negative bacteria (Aeromonas salmonicida salmonicida, Motile Aeromonas, Flavobacterium sp., Pseudomonas fluorescens, Shewanella putrifaciens), as well as the other Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus megaterium ATCC14581, Carnobacterium maltaromaticum ATCC27865, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC19433, and Micrococcus leteus ATCC4698), and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) of Dpd in the zebra mussel suggested that the Dpd was expressed in a variety of tissues, such as foot, retractor muscle, ctenidium, mantle, hemocytes, gonad, digestive gland, and intestine. By using the quantitative PCR, the expression level of Dpd in the zebra mussel foot was the highest, followed by the muscle. By comparing the amount of Dpd transcripts in the zebra mussel foot under two different byssogenesis conditions (byssogenesis and non-byssogenesis) with qPCR, we found that the higher expression levels of Dpd were always associated with the byssogenesis status from 2 to 4 days after the start of byssogenesis. Findings of this study suggest that the expression of the Dpd gene was upregulated in vivo by byssogeneis, and by hemocytes in vitro upon stimulation with microbial antigens.
TI  - Bacteriological screening of donor human milk before and after Holder pasteurization.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In order to ascertain any bacterial contamination of donor human milk, we cultured milk samples both before and after Holder pasteurization. METHODS: During 2003, all frozen donor milk samples were thawed and aseptically placed in pools prior to pasteurization. All individual and pooled samples were cultured and incubated for 48 hours. Specific microbiologic identification of group B Streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, alpha-Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Bacillus sp. was performed. Gram-negative rods (GNRs) were subtyped but not specifically identified. Positive cultures were expressed in quantitative colony counts. RESULTS: Samples from 303 pools and 810 individual mother's donor milk were cultured. Forty-four pools (15%) represented "preterm donor milk" from milk donated by mothers who delivered prior to 36 weeks of gestation. Before pasteurization, 185 pools (62%) grew at least one lactose-fermenting GNR, and 58 pools (19%) grew a second lactose-fermenting GNR. Forty-four percent grew a non-lactose-fermenting GNR, and 20% grew an oxidase-positive GNR. The majority (87%) were colonized with Staphylococcus. Other Gram-positive organisms identified included Enterococcus (16%), alpha-Streptococcus (8%), and S. aureus (4%). Only one milk sample was positive for methicillin-resistant S. aureus. The majority of pooled milk samples grew two or more organisms. Milk from 22% of mothers did not grow detectable bacteria on routine cultures. The bacteriologic colonization profiles of milk from mothers delivering prematurely were similar to those of mothers delivering at term. After routine Holder pasteurization of donor milk, 93% of milk samples showed no growth on routine bacterial cultures. CONCLUSIONS: A wide variety of bacteria contaminate human milk from donor mothers. Most milk samples grew coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Gram-negative organisms. Although normal skin flora was cultured typically from milk samples, there were also many prepasteurization milk samples contaminated with pathogenic organisms. Holder pasteurization was, however, an effective means by which to remove any detectable bacteria from samples of donor human milk.
TI  - Leptotrichia hongkongensis sp. nov., a novel Leptotrichia species with the oral cavity as its natural reservoir.
AB  - A straight, non-sporulating, Gram-variable bacillus (HKU24(T)) was recovered from the blood culture of a patient with metastatic breast carcinoma. After repeated subculturing in BACTEC Plus Anaerobic/F blood culture broth, HKU24(T) grew on brucella agar as non-hemolytic, pinpoint colonies after 96 h of incubation at 37 degrees C in an anaerobic environment and aerobic environment with 5% CO2. Growth was enhanced with a streak of Staphylococcus aureus. HKU24(T) was non-motile and catalase-negative, but positive for alkaline phosphatase, beta-glucosidase, and alpha-glucosidase. It hydrolyzed phenylphosphonate and reduced resazurin. 16S rRNA, groEL, gyrB, recA, and rpoB sequencing showed that HKU24(T) occupies a distinct phylogenetic position among the Leptotrichia species, being most closely related to Leptotrichia trevisanii. Using HKU24(T) groEL, gyrB, recA, and rpoB gene-specific primers, fragments of these genes were amplified from one of 20 oral specimens. Based on phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, we propose a new species, Leptotrichia hongkongensis sp. nov., to describe this bacterium.
TI  - A survey of veterinary hospitals in Nigeria for the presence of some bacterial organisms of nosocomial and zoonotic potential.
AB  - This study was undertaken to determine the type and estimate the prevalence of bacterial organisms on contact surfaces of five close-to-patient facilities in three veterinary health care settings within the Sokoto metropolis of north-western Nigeria. A total of 30 samples (10 from each setting) were collected and analysed using culture, microscopy and biochemical testing. Bacterial species isolated from samples in this study included the following: Bacillus sp. (27.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.9%), Listeria sp. (13.6%), Streptococcus sp. (11.4%), Salmonella sp. (6.8%), Escherichia coli (4.5%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (4.5%), Citrobacter sp. (2.3%), Klebsiella sp. (2.3%), Lactobacillus sp. (2.3%), Micrococcus sp. (2.3%), Pasteurella sp. (2.3%), Proteus sp. (2.3%), and Yersinia sp. (2.3%). A higher percentage (64.3%) of the total bacterial isolates were zoonotic in nature and hence of public health significance. Some pathogens have the potential of nosocomial spread. In this study, we seek to establish the first evidence of bacterial presence in the major veterinary health care settings in the Sokoto region of north-western Nigeria. Of particular interest is the hypothesis, which has not previously been formally tested, that nosocomial infections are especially likely to be implicated in both animals and occupational diseases in Nigeria. It was suggested that some of these isolates were associated with the risk of nosocomial and zoonotic infections and hence draws attention to the need to rigorously employ standard veterinary precautions as part of the hospital's infection control programme in an attempt to protect both patients and staff from infections.
TI  - Identification, fermentation, and bioactivity against Xanthomonas oryzae of antimicrobial metabolites isolated from Phomopsis longicolla S1B4.
AB  - Bacterial blight, an important and potentially destructive bacterial disease in rice, is caused by Xanthomonas oryzae. Recently, this organism has developed resistance to available antibiotics, prompting scientists to find a suitable alternative. This study focused on secondary metabolites of Phomopsis longicolla to target X. oryzae. Five bioactive compounds were isolated by activity-guided fractionation from ethyl acetate extracts of mycelia and were identified by LC/MS and NMR spectroscopy as dicerandrol A, dicerandrol B, dicerandrol C, deacetylphomoxanthone B, and fusaristatin A. This is the first time fusaristatin A has been isolated from Phomopsis sp. Deacetylphomoxanthone B showed a higher antibacterial effect against X. oryzae KACC 10331 than the positive control (2,4-diacetyphloroglucinol). Dicerandrol A also showed high antimicrobial activity against Grampositive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis) and yeast (Candida albicans). In addition, high production yields of these compounds were obtained at the stationary and death phases.
TI  - Streptomyces caeruleatus sp. nov., with dark blue diffusible pigment.
AB  - An actinomycete, designated strain GIMN4.002(T), was isolated from a tomato rhizosphere soil sample in Guangzhou, China. The strain produces white aerial mycelium and dark blue diffusible pigment on Gause's synthetic agar, and microscopic observation revealed that it produces looped chains of spiny spores. Morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics of the strain are typical of the genus Streptomyces. Melanin was produced and antibacterial activity was detected against Gram-positive micro-organisms, such as Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain GIMN4.002(T) had highest similarity (99.4 %) to Streptomyces lincolnensis B91; however, DNA-DNA relatedness between strain GIMN4.002(T) and S. lincolnensis NBRC 13054(T) was only 32.17 %. Further, the morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics of strain GIMN4.002(T) are distinct from S. lincolnensis and other species of the genus Streptomyces with which this strain has high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity (98-99 %). On the basis of the physiological and molecular properties observed, it is proposed that strain GIMN4.002(T) represents a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces caeruleatus sp. nov. is proposed, with GIMN4.002(T) (=CCTCC M 208213(T) =NRRL B-24802(T)) as the type strain.
TI  - A new prenylated flavanoid with antibacterial activity from propolis collected in Egypt.
AB  - A novel prenylated flavanoid, isonymphaeol-D (1), together with two known compounds, isonymphaeol-B (2) and nymphaeol-B (3), were isolated from Egyptian propolis. The structures of the isolated compounds were determined by various spectroscopic methods. 1 exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative strains (Serratia sp., Pseudomonos sp., Escherichia coli).
TI  - The swaposin-like domain of potato aspartic protease (StAsp-PSI) exerts antimicrobial activity on plant and human pathogens.
AB  - Plant-specific insert domain (PSI) is a region of approximately 100 amino acid residues present in most plant aspartic protease (AP) precursors. PSI is not a true saposin domain; it is the exchange of the N- and C-terminal portions of the saposin like domain. Hence, PSI is called a swaposin domain. Here, we report the cloned, heterologous expression and purification of PSI from StAsp 1 (Solanum tuberosum aspartic protease 1), called StAsp-PSI. Results obtained here show that StAsp-PSI is able to kill spores of two potato pathogens in a dose-dependent manner without any deleterious effect on plant cells. As reported for StAPs (S. tuberosum aspartic proteases), the StAsp-PSI ability to kill microbial pathogens is dependent on the direct interaction of the protein with the microbial cell wall/or membrane, leading to increased permeability and lysis. Additionally, we demonstrated that, like proteins of the SAPLIP family, StAsp-PSI and StAPs are cytotoxic to Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in a dose dependent manner. The amino acid residues conserved in SP_B (pulmonary surfactant protein B) and StAsp-PSI could explain the cytotoxic activity exerted by StAsp-PSI and StAPs against Gram-positive bacteria. These results and data previously reported suggest that the presence of the PSI domain in mature StAPs could be related to their antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Modified phenazines from an Indonesian Streptomyces sp.
AB  - Fractionation of the extract from the Indonesian Streptomyces sp. ICBB8198 as directed by the antibacterial activity delivered the known phenazine antibiotics griseoluteic acid (1a) and griseolutein A (1b), as well as two new phenazine derivatives (2 and 3). In addition, the known compounds spirodionic acid, dihydrosarkomycins, and 6-ethyl-4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethyl-2H-pyran-2-one (4a), along with the new pyrone 3,6-diethyl-4-hydroxy-5-methyl-2H-pyran-2-one (4b), were isolated. We report here the isolation, structure elucidation, and antibiotic activity of the new metabolites as well as a hypothetical pathway for the formation of the new phenazine derivatives.
TI  - Walkmycin B targets WalK (YycG), a histidine kinase essential for bacterial cell  growth.
AB  - The WalK (a histidine kinase)/WalR (a response regulator, aka YycG/YycF) two-component system is indispensable in the signal transduction pathway for the cell-wall metabolism of Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. The inhibitors directed against WalK would be expected to have a bactericidal effect. After we screened 1368 culture broths of Streptomyces sp. by a differential growth assay, walkmycin A, B and C, which were produced by strain MK632-100F11, were purified using silica-gel column chromatography and HPLC. In this paper, the chemical structure of the major product (walkmycin B) was determined to be di-anthracenone (C(44)H(44)Cl(2)O(14)), which was very similar to BE40665A. MICs of walkmycin B against B. subtilis and S. aureus were 0.39 and 0.20 microg ml(-1), and IC(50) measurements against WalK were 1.6 and 5.7 microM, respectively. To clarify the affinity between WalK and walkmycin B, surface plasmon resonance was measured to obtain the equilibrium dissociation constant, K(D1), of 7.63 microM at the higher affinity site of B. subtilis WalK. These results suggest that walkmycin B inhibits WalK autophosphorylation by binding to the WalK cytoplasmic domain.
TI  - Discorhabdins from the Korean marine sponge Sceptrella sp.
AB  - Two new pyrroloiminoquinone alkaloids of the discorhabdin class, along with 12 compounds including one previously described synthetic derivative of the same and related skeletal classes, were isolated from the sponge Sceptrella sp., collected from Gageodo, Korea. The structures of these new compounds, designated as (-)-3-dihydrodiscorhabdin D (11) and (-)-discorhabdin Z (12), were determined by combined spectroscopic analyses. Compound 12 possesses an unusual hemiaminal group among the discorhabdin alkaloids. These compounds exhibited moderate to significant cytotoxicity, antibacterial activity, and inhibitory activity against sortase A.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Enterococcus Faecium Fair-E 198 against gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - This study investigated the antimicrobial activity of Enterococcus faecium FAIR-E 198 against Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. Using the critical-dilution method, the bacteriocin produced by E. faecium FAIR-E 198 inhibited all L. monocytogenes strains evaluated (1,600 to 19,200 AU mL(-1)). However, none of the B. cereus and S. aureus strains investigated were inhibited. The maximum activity of this bacteriocin (800 AU mL(-1)) was observed in MRS broth, while the activity in milk was 100 AU mL(-1). In the co-cultivation test in milk, B. cereus K1-B041 was reduced to below the detection limit (1.00 log CFU mL(-1)) after 48 h. E. faecium reduced the initial L. monocytogenes Scott A population by 1 log CFU mL(-1) after 3 h at 35 degrees C, However, the pathogen regained growth, reaching 3.68 log CFU mL(-1) after 48 h. E. faecium did not influence the growth of S. aureus ATCC 27154 during the 48 h of co-cultivation, Therefore, it can be concluded that the effectiveness of the antimicrobial activity of E. faecium FAIR-E 198 is strictly related to the species and strain of the target microorganism and to the culture medium.
TI  - Isolation and identification of microbes associated with mobile phones in Dammam  in eastern Saudi Arabia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to determine microbial contamination of mobile phones in the city of Dammam, in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia, and identify the most important microbial species associated with these phones in order to take the necessary remedial measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis of a total of 202 samples was done to identify fungal and pathogenic bacteria isolates. Sterile swabs were firmly passed on the handset, the buttons and the screens of mobile phones, then inoculated into media of bacteria and fungi. Frequency distribution of isolates were calculated. RESULTS: There were 737 isolated of the following bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria sicca, Micrococcus luteus, Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus subtilis, and Enterobacter aerogenes at the rate of 56.58, 13.57, 8.01, 7.73, 6.51, 3.66, 2.85 and 1.09% respectively. There were fungal isolates as follows: Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus niger, Cladosporium sp., Penicillium spp., Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Rhizopus stolonifer, Aspergillus ochraceus at the rate of 29.07, 26.74, 20.93, 10.47, 6.98, 2.33, 2.33, 1.16%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that all mobile phones under consideration were infected by several microbes, most of which belonged to the natural flora of the human body as well as airborne fungi and soil. This means that it is necessary to sterilize hands after contact with a phone since it is a source of disease transmission.
TI  - Alternaramide, a cyclic depsipeptide from the marine-derived fungus Alternaria sp. SF-5016.
AB  - Alternaramide (1), a cyclic pentadepsipeptide, has been isolated from an EtOAc extract of the marine-derived fungus Alternaria sp. SF-5016 by various chromatographic methods. The structure of 1 was mainly determined by analysis of the NMR spectroscopic data, along with chemical methods such as Marfey's and Mosher's methods. Alternaramide (1) showed weak antibiotic activity against Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Hymenopsins A and B and a macrophorin analogue from a fungicolous Hymenopsis sp.
AB  - Hymenopsin A (1), hymenopsin B (2), and a new macrophorin analogue, 2',3'-epoxy-13-hydroxy-4'-oxomacrophorin A (3), have been isolated from a fungicolous isolate of Hymenopsis sp. (MYC-1703; NRRL 37638). The structures and relative configurations of these compounds were assigned on the basis of 2D NMR and MS data, and the identity of 1 was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis. The absolute configuration of 2 was proposed on the basis of CD analysis using both empirical and computational methods. Compounds 2 and 3 showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis. Compound 3 was also active against Aspergillus flavus and Fusarium verticillioides.
TI  - An antimicrobial guanidine-bearing sesterterpene from the cultured cyanobacterium Scytonema sp.
AB  - Scytoscalarol (1), a antimicrobial sesterterpene bearing a guanidino group, was isolated from the cultured cyanobacterium Scytonema sp. (UTEX 1163) by bioassay-guided fractionation. The chemical structure was determined by spectroscopic analysis including MS and 1D and 2D NMR. Scytoscalarol (1) showed antimicrobial activities against Bacillus anthracis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis with MIC values in the range from 2 to 110 microM.
TI  - Assessment of microbiological quality of sachet-packaged drinking water in Western Nigeria and its public health significance.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the microbiological quality of sachet-packaged drinking water in Western Nigeria and its impact on public health. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional microbiological testing. METHODS: Ninety-two sachet-packaged water samples were analysed for microbiological and metal qualities. Total bacterial and coliform counts were determined, and the presence of Escherichia coli, an important water quality indicator, was tested. The level of conformity of the water processors with the guidelines of Nigeria's quality regulatory agency was also determined. RESULTS: Varying levels of microbial contamination were recorded in samples from the different sampling locations. The total bacteria count ranged between 2.86 and 3.45log colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. The highest coliform count recorded was 1.62log cfu/ml. Faecal coliform E. coli was detected in one sample from Oke-Iho and one sample from Okaka, representing 2.2% of total samples. Lead and manganese were not found in any of the samples. However, iron was detected and the highest iron concentration (0.10mg/l) was detected in samples from Ikorodu. The bacteria that were identified from the water samples included E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus lactis, Aeromonas sp. and Micrococcus luteum. Many of the water processors did not comply with the guidelines of the quality regulatory agency. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the sachet-packaged samples of drinking water were of poor quality. The results indicate a need for Nigeria's quality regulatory agency to take appropriate measures in safeguarding public health.
TI  - New cyclopentenones from strain Trichoderma sp. YLF-3.
AB  - Two new cyclopentenones, trichodermone A (1) and trichodermone B (2), together with a known compound, 3-(3-oxocyclopent-1-enyl) propanoic acid (3), were isolated from the strain Trichoderma sp. YLF-3. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of their spectroscopic data. All compounds were assayed for antibacterial activity. Compound 3 showed activity against Staphyloccocus aureus and Bacillus cereus.
TI  - The microbial colonisation of mobile phone used by healthcare staffs.
AB  - Mobile phones are dispensable accessories in social life and normally they are not cleaned properly. Therefore, they serve as a reservoir of bacteria and may cause nosocomial infections in hospitals. The purpose of this study was to investigate microbiological colonization of mobile phones used by healthcare staffs. The study was carried out collecting swab samples with Cary-Blair transport medium from mobile phones of attending healthcare staffs from different departments of three hospitals in March, 2008. All collected samples were inoculated in 5% sheep blood agar, eosin-methylene blue agar and Sabouraud Dextrose agar. Isolated bacteria were identified using by classic technique and Vitec2 (Biomerieux, France) full automated bacteria identification system. Growth was observed in 65 of collected 106 samples, corresponding to 61.3%. The most frequent bacteria were Staphylococcus epidermidis followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus sp., Corynebacterium sp. and Escherichia coli, respectively. In conclusion, bacteria were colonized on mobile phones frequently and mobile phones may become reservoir of microorganism for nosocomial infections.
TI  - Growth and gaseous emissions of pure and mixed small intestinal bacterial cultures: Effects of bile and vancomycin.
AB  - Simultaneous cultivations in anaerobiosis, aerobiosis and with microaerobic gas mixture were used to clarify the bile (oxgall) effects on the pure and mixed cultures of enterobacterial strains in simulations in Portable Microbe Enrichment Unit (PMEU) linked with ChemPro100i((R)) gas detector. The effects of vancomycin were evaluated in aerobic cultures. Growth and metabolic activity of cultures were also followed by measuring sugar consumption, pH alterations, and colony counts on BD CHROMagar Orientation plates. Results showed that the two fermentatively different strains of facultative anaerobes, Escherichia coli E 17 and Klebsiella mobilis ATCC 13048 grew in balance regardless of oxygen level, bile acid concentration or other components of the mixed cultures, Bacillus cereus or Staphylococcus aureus. When the evaporations of the mixed cultures of E. coli, K. mobilis and S. aureus were compared with the emissions of the corresponding pure cultures by ChemPro100i((R)) gas sensing detector, the pure cultures of bile resistant E. coli and K. mobilis produced more gaseous components than the mixed culture indicating that these organisms cooperate and use the substrate more effectively together than separately. A survey of the aseptic bacterial isolations from the bile tract in a big University Hospital, (Salzburg, Austria) during 3 years, showed that these bacterial groups dominated. Only 13.24% of the 287 patient samples were sterile, and around 180 strains of both E. coli and Klebsiella/Enterobacter groups were found amongst 973 isolates from 249 patients (together 35.57%). Enterococcus sp. accounted for 246 isolates being the largest group of strains (24.25% of all the isolates). In anaerobiosis it was shown that Klebsiella neutralized the acids produced in the mixed acid fermentation of the E. coli. The ethanol produced from both groups evaporated in the gas stream of the PMEU culturing step and its formation also removes excess acidity from the cultures. The synergistic behaviour and symbiotic function between E. coli and Klebsiella/Enterobacter strains is suggested.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ethanol extracts of seaweeds against fish bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Crude extracts were prepared using the solvent ethanol from the seaweeds viz., Gracilaria edulis, Calorpha peltada and Hydroclothres sp. and screening for their antibacterial activity against six bacterial pathogens were also carried out. The test bacterial strains were Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus. Ethanol extract of Gracilaria edulis inhibited growth of all the test organisms except Bacillus cereus and Enterobacter aerogenes. Seaweed extract of Calorpha peltada was found effective against a number of Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. Hydroclothres sp. extract inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa only out of the six tested pathogens.
TI  - Characterization of Lactobacillus spp. isolated from the feces of breast-feeding  piglets.
AB  - Lactobacillus spp., referred to as IJ-1 and IJ-2, were isolated from the feces of breast-feeding piglets and analyzed for probiotic properties. According to the analyses of 16S rDNA sequence, Lactobacillus sp. IJ-1 showed greater than 99% homology with Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 20016(T), and Lactobacillus sp. IJ-2 had greater than 99% homology with the L. gasseri ATCC 33323(T) and L. johnsonii ATCC 33200(T). The pH changes in the culture media of Lactobacillus sp. IJ-1 and Lactobacillus sp. IJ-2 were from 6.5 to 4.2 and 4.6, respectively. Their respective resistance against artificial gastric acid and artificial bile acid led to survival rates of nearly 186+/-44% and 13+/-5%. Neither strain produced the carcinogenic enzyme beta-glucuronidase. Both strains inhibited the growth of pathogenic microorganisms, such as Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19111, Salmonella enterica KCTC 12401, Salmonella enteritidis ATCC 13076, Staphylococcus aureus KCTC 3881, and Bacillus cereus 3711, within 24 h of growth.
TI  - Structure and applications of a rhamnolipid surfactant produced in soybean oil waste.
AB  - Soybean oil soapstock was utilized as an alternative carbon source for the production of rhamnolipids by Pseudomonas aeruginosa LBI strain. The chemical composition and properties of the rhamnolipid mixture obtained were determined to define its potential applications. The chemical characterization of the rhamnolipid has revealed the presence of ten different homologues. The monorhamnolipid RhaC10C1) and the dirhamnolipid Rha2C10C10 were the main components of the mixture that showed predominance of 44% and 29%, respectively, after 144-h of cultivation. The biosurfactant was able to form stable emulsions with several hydrocarbons and showed excellent emulsification for soybean oil and chicken fat (100%). The rhamnolipid removed 67% of crude oil present in sand samples and presented antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus and Mucor miehei at 64 microg/mL and inhibition of Neurospora crassa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Micrococcus luteus at 256 microg/mL. The results demonstrated that the rhamnolipid produced in soybean oil soapstock can be useful in environmental and food industry applications.
TI  - New thioureides of 2-(4-methylphenoxymethyl) benzoic acid with antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate in vitro, by means of qualitative and quantative methods, the antimicrobial activity of some new synthesized chemical compounds previously solubilized in DMF (Dimethyl formamide). The qualitative screening of the susceptibility spectra of different microbial strains versus these compounds was performed by three adaptated diffusion methods: paper filter disk impregnation with the tested substances solutions, the disposal of tested solutions in agar wells and the spotting of tested solutions on solid medium previously inoculated with microbial suspension. The quantitative assay of the antimicrobial activity was performed by broth microdilution method in 96-well microplates in order to establish the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC).The antimicrobial activity was tested against Gram-positive strains (Staphylococcus) aureus sp., Bacillus subtilis sp.), Gram-negative (Escherichia coli sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa sp., Klebsiella pneumonia sp.) and fungal strains (Candida albicans sp, Aspergillus nige rsp.). All tests were performed by comparison with the reference strains: K. pneumoniae IC 13420, E. coli IC 13529, S. aureus IC 13204, P. aeruginosa IC 13202, B. subtilis IC 12488, C. albicans IC 249, A. niger IC 13534. Our results indicated that the tested compounds exhibited specific antimicrobial activity, the highest activity being noticed against planktonic fungal cells (MIC ranging from 62.5 microg to 15.6 microg), followed by P. aeruginosa (MICs from 250 microg to 31.5 microg). Only few compounds exhibited antimicrobial activity against E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Antimicrobial activity against Gram positive bacteria was noticed for the most of the tested compounds, five of them exhibiting very low MIC values (MICs from 1000 microg to 62.5 microg).
TI  - Aureobasidin, new antifouling metabolite from marine-derived fungus Aureobasidium sp.
AB  - Two antifouling compounds, aureobasidin (1), a new ester with an unusual 4,6-dihydroxydecanoic acid residue, and (3R,5S)-3,5-dihydroxydecanoic acid (2), were isolated from the marine-derived fungus Aureobasidium sp., in addition to (5R,3Z)-5-hydroxydec-3-enoic acid (3) and (R)-3-hydroxydecanoic acid (4). The structures were unambiguously established by IR, 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic and mass spectral data. Compounds 1-3 were found to be active against Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Staphyllococcus aureus. Compound 3 showed fungistatic activity against Candida albicans.
TI  - Characterization and purification of a new bacteriocin with a broad inhibitory spectrum produced by Lactobacillus plantarum lp 31 strain isolated from dry-fermented sausage.
AB  - AIMS: Characterization and purification of a new bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum LP 31 strain, isolated from Argentinian dry-fermented sausage. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lactobacillus plantarum LP 31 strain produces an antimicrobial compound that inhibits the growth of food-borne pathogenic bacteria. It was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, was stable to heat and catalase and exhibited maximum activity in the pH range from 5.0 to 6.0. Consequently, it was characterized as a bacteriocin. It was purified by RP (reverse-phase) solid-phase extraction, gel filtration chromatography and RP-HPLC. Plantaricin produced by Lact. plantarum LP 31 is a peptide with a molecular weight of 1558.85 Da as determined by Maldi-Tof mass spectrometry and contains 14 amino acid residues. It was shown to have a bactericidal effect against Pseudomonas sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes. CONCLUSIONS: The bacteriocin produced by Lact. plantarum LP 31 may be considered as a new plantaricin according to its low molecular weight and particular amino acid composition. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: In view of the interesting inhibitory spectrum of this bacteriocin and because of its good technological properties (resistance to heat and activity at acidic pH), this bacteriocin has potential applications as a biopreservative to prevent the growth of food-borne pathogens and food spoilage bacteria in certain food products.
TI  - Nagelamides Q and R, novel dimeric bromopyrrole alkaloids from sponges Agelas sp.
AB  - Two new dimeric bromopyrrole alkaloids, nagelamides Q (1) and R (2), have been isolated from Okinawan marine sponges of the genus Agelas (SS-1134 and SS-956, respectively), and the structures and stereochemistry were elucidated from spectroscopic data. Nagelamide Q (1) is a rare dimeric bromopyrrole alkaloid possessing a pyrrolidine ring, while nagelamide R (2) is the first bromopyrrole alkaloid having an oxazoline ring. Nagelamides Q (1) and R (2) showed antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Mansoquinone: isolation and structure elucidation of new antibacterial aromatic polyketides from terrestrial Streptomyces Sp. Eg5.
AB  - The cultivation of terrestrial Streptomyces Sp. Eg5 delivered two new aromatic polyketides, 2-butyryl-1,8-dihydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone (2), or mansoquinone, and 2-acetyl-1,8-dihydroxy-3-methyl-anthra-quinone (3) along with the known 2-ethyl-1,8-dihydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone (1). The structure of mansoquinone (2) was elucidated using detailed spectral ((1)H and (13)C NMR, (1)H-(1)H COSY, HSQC, HMBC and HRMS) analysis. This is the first report of the isolation of 3 from natural source. Mansoquinone (2) exhibited moderate antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Novel natural parabens produced by a Microbulbifer bacterium in its calcareous sponge host Leuconia nivea.
AB  - A broad variety of natural parabens, including four novel structures and known ethyl and butyl parabens, were obtained from culture of a Microbulbifer sp. bacterial strain isolated from the temperate calcareous marine sponge Leuconia nivea (Grant 1826). Their structures were elucidated from spectral analysis, including mass spectrometry and 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance. Their antimicrobial activity evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus was characterized by much higher in vitro activity of these natural paraben compounds 3-9 than commercial synthetic methyl and propyl parabens, usually used as antimicrobial preservatives. Compounds 4 and 9 revealed a bacteriostatic effect and compounds 6 and 7 appeared as bactericidal compounds. Major paraben compound 6 was also active against Gram positive Bacillus sp. and Planococcus sp. sponge isolates and was detected in whole sponge extracts during all seasons, showing its persistent in situ production within the sponge. Moreover, Microbulbifer sp. bacteria were visualized in the sponge body wall using fluorescence in situ hybridization with a probe specific to L4-n2 phylotypes. Co-detection in the sponge host of both paraben metabolites and Microbulbifer sp. L4-n2 indicates, for the first time, production of natural parabens in a sponge host, which may have an ecological role as chemical mediators.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some macrophytes from Lake Manzalah (Egypt).
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of aqueous and organic solvents (chloroform, ethanol and methanol) extracts of four plants Ceratophyllum demersum L., Eichhornia crassipes, Potamogeton crispus and Potamogeton pectinatus were tested in vitro against seventeen different microorganisms including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. Nine of these identified organisms were obtained from different sources, Bacillus subtilis 1020, Bacillus cereus 1080, Staphylococcus aureus, Erwinia carotovora NCPPB 312, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Aspergillus niger, Fusarium oxysporum and Penicillium italicum. The other eight organisms were isolated from Manzalah lake water and identified using API 20E strip system (BioMereux). One hundred pathogenic bacterial isolates representing eight genera were identified to species level. These organisms are Escherichia coli (20%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14%), Salmonella colerasuis (13%), Shigella sp. (11%), Serratia liquefaciens (10%), Proteus vulgaris (9%) and Brenneria nigrifluens (7%). The extracts of all tested plants demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the used organisms. The efficiency of the extracts varied with, solvent used in the extraction as well as plant species and the part of plant used. The aqueous extract appeared to be the highly effective extract against all tested organisms especially Fusarium oxysporum causing inhibition zone 48 +/- 0.01 mm, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 59 +/- 0.02 mm and Salmonella cholerasuis 55 +/- 0.01 mm when using P. crispus, P. pectinatus and C. demersum, respectively. Ethanol extracts of C. demersum, P. crispus and E. crassipes root showed antimicrobial activities against all tested organisms except Aspergillus niger. At the same time the extract of P. pectinatus had no effect also on Fusarium oxysporum and the extract of E. crassipes leaves have no effect on Penicillium italicum. On using chloroform extracts Escherichia coli, Aspergillus niger and Penicillium italicum showed resistance. Comparing the effect of different plants extracts C. demersum appeared to be the most effective followed by P. pectinatus. Furthermore, the extracts of E. crassipes leaves being more effective than that, of its roots. Elemental analysis were also takes place in water and plant samples and the results revealed the presence of Mn and Pb in higher concentration in P. pectinatus (Mn 603 +/- 4.243 ppm and Pb 44 +/- 2.828 ppm), at the same time the highest values of Fe 1680 +/- 2.2 ppm, Zn 31.5 +/- 2.1 ppm and Cu 26.5 +/- 2.1 ppm were recorded for C. demersum. Comparing the two parts of E. crassipes (leaves and roots), the roots have the highest values of all studied metals.
TI  - Spontaneous fermentation of traditional sago starch in Papua New Guinea.
AB  - Sago starch is an important dietary carbohydrate in lowland Papua New Guinea (PNG). An investigation was conducted to determine whether microbes play a role in its preservation using traditional methods. In 12 stored sago samples collected from PNG villages, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were present (> or = 3.6 x 10(4)cfu/g) and pH ranged from 6.8 to 4.2. Acetic and propionic acids were detected in all samples, while butyric, lactic and valeric acids were present in six or more. In freshly prepared sago, held in sealed containers in the laboratory at 30 degrees C, spontaneous fermentation by endogenous microflora of sago starch was observed. This was evident by increasing concentrations of acetic, butyric and lactic acids over 4 weeks, and pH reducing from 4.9 to 3.1: both LAB and yeasts were involved. Survival of potential bacterial pathogens was monitored by seeding sago starch with approximately 10(4)/g of selected organisms. Numbers of Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus fell to < 30/g within 7 days. Salmonella sp. was present only in low numbers after 7 days (< 36/g), but Escherichia coli was still detectable after three weeks (> 10(2)/g). Fermentation appeared to increase the storability and safety of the product.
TI  - Macrolactin S, a new antibacterial agent with FabG-inhibitory activity from Bacillus sp. AT28.
AB  - In the course of screening for FabG inhibitors from microbial sources, a new 24-membered ring lactone named macrolactin S, along with the known compound macrolactin B, has been isolated from the mycelium of liquid fermentation cultures of Bacillus sp. AT28. The structure of macrolactin S was determined on the basis of MS and NMR data. Macrolactin S showed a dose-dependent inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus FabG, not inhibiting S. aureus FabI. Also macrolactin S inhibited the growth of S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Efficiency of KrCl excilamp (222 nm) for inactivation of bacteria in suspension.
AB  - AIMS: To examine the killing efficiency of UV KrCl excilamp against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Vegetative cells of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes at initial populations from 10(2) to 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU) ml(-1) were treated by KrCl excilamp in sterile Ringer's solution with and without H(2)O(2). The number of viable cells was determined using spread plating techniques and nutrient agar method with subsequent incubation at 28 degrees C or 37 degrees C for 24 h. At estimated populations of 10(2)-10(5) CFU ml(-1) E. coli O157:H7 and Staph. aureus were the most sensitive and showed 100% disinfection within 15 s (29.2 mJ cm(-2)). Bacillus subtilis was more sensitive to UV treatment than B. cereus. The UV/H(2)O(2) inactivation rate coefficients within this population range were two times higher than those observed for UV treatment alone. No effect of H(2)O(2) was observed at 10(7) CFU ml(-1) for Bacillus sp. and Strep. pyogenes. CONCLUSIONS: The narrow-band UV radiation at 222 nm was effective in the rapid disinfection of bacteria in aqueous suspensions. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: KrCl excilamps represent UV sources which can be applied for disinfection of drinking water in advanced oxidation processes.
TI  - Microbial burden of some herbal antimalarials marketed at Elele, Rivers State.
AB  - Herbal antimalarials still remain an alternative to our traditional communities who can not afford orthodox antimalarials. This study was aimed at investigating the microbial quality of six herbal antimalarials using standard microbiological methods. Of the six preparations analyzed, "schnapps", palm wine and water were the media of preparation; the water base preparations recorded higher microbial load. The mean microbial load was 159.5 x 10(5) cfu/ml and 217.4 x 10(2)cfu/ml in water and alcohol base preparations respectively. The microbial profile of the preparations showed that the schnapps base preparations were predominantly contaminated with Bacillus sp (Aerobic spore bearers) and Mucor spp. The palm wine preparation harboured Bacillus sp, yeasts and Mucor spp while the water base preparations had several isolates such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli 0157H7, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus feacalis, Serratia marcensces, Staph. aureus, Bacillus spp and Mucor spp. Conclusively, this study underlines the public health importance of these preparations given the high burden of such human pathogen as Ecoli O157H7, Ps aeruginosa, Stahp aureus, etc. in the preparations.
TI  - Phylogenetic diversity and antimicrobial activities of fungi associated with Haliclona simulans isolated from Irish coastal waters.
AB  - The diversity and antimicrobial activities of 80 fungi isolated from Haliclona simulans were assessed using different fungal media containing either agar or gellum gum. In total, 19 different genotypes were detected. These fungal isolates could be classified as members of the Agaricomycotina, Mucoromycotina, Saccharomycotina, and Pezizomycotina, although the majority of the isolates were associated with the latter class. Some of these fungal isolates showed antimicrobial inhibition of Escherichia coli, Bacillus sp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida glabrata. Fungal 18S rRNA gene sequences belonging to Eurotiales, Calosphaeriales, and Chaetothyriales were amplified from DNA and RNA extracted from this marine sponge. This study indicates that in contrast to the low diversity of fungi detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR amplification from extracts of this marine sponge, a much higher diversity of fungi could be cultured. The data suggests that some fungi live in symbiosis with H. simulans, whereas other fungi may have been ingested from the surrounding seawater.
TI  - Compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis of D-alanine, L-alanine, and valine:  application of diastereomer separation to delta15N and microbial peptidoglycan studies.
AB  - We have developed an analytical method to determine the compound-specific nitrogen isotope compositions of individual amino acid enantiomers using gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry. A novel derivatization of amino acid diastereomers by optically active (R)-(-)-2-butanol or (S)-(+)-2-butanol offers two advantages for nitrogen isotope analysis. First, chromatographic chiral separation can be achieved without the use of chiral stationary-phase columns. Second, the elution order of these compounds on the chromatogram can be switched by a designated esterification reaction. We applied the method to the compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis of D- and L-alanine in a peptidoglycan derived from the cell walls of cultured bacteria (Firmicutes and Actinobacteria; Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus staphylolyticus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, and Streptomyces sp.), natural whole bacterial cells (Bacillus subtilis var. natto), (pseudo)-peptidoglycan from archaea (Methanobacterium sp.), and cell wall from eukaryota (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). We observed statistically significant differences in nitrogen isotopic compositions; e.g., delta15N ( per thousand vs air) in Staphylococcus staphylolyticus for d-alanine (19.2 +/- 0.5 per thousand, n = 4) and L-alanine (21.3 +/- 0.8 per thousand, n = 4) and in Bacillus subtilis for D-alanine (6.2 +/- 0.2 per thousand, n = 3) and L-alanine (8.2 +/- 0.4 per thousand, n = 3). These results suggest that enzymatic reaction pathways, including the alanine racemase reaction, produce a nitrogen isotopic difference in amino acid enantiomers, resulting in 15N-depleted D-alanine. This method is expected to facilitate compound-specific nitrogen isotope studies of amino acid stereoisomers.
TI  - Bacterial contamination in drinking water: a case study in rural areas of northern Rajasthan, India.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the bacterial contaminations in drinking water samples collected form some rural habitations of northern Rajasthan, India. A total of ten bacterial species: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella sp, Proteus vulgaris, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus lactis and Micrococcus luteum were identified form drinking water samples. The bacteria belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae (coliforms) showed the maximum occurrences in water samples. The total coliforms count, i.e. TTC(m) (m = MPN index/100 ml) in drinking water samples was in the ranges of 25 TTC(m) (village Naiwala)-41 TTC(m) (village Meharwala). The data suggested that the drinking water quality deterioration in rural habitations of this region was due to poor sanitation and unawareness about personal hygienic practices. The occurrences some pathogenic bacteria in drinking water may increase the risks of water-related diseases and health problems in local residents.
TI  - The lantibiotic mersacidin is a strong inducer of the cell wall stress response of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The lantibiotic mersacidin is an antimicrobial peptide of 20 amino acids that is ribosomally produced by Bacillus sp. strain HIL Y-85,54728. Mersacidin acts by complexing the sugar phosphate head group of the peptidoglycan precursor lipid II, thereby inhibiting the transglycosylation reaction of peptidoglycan biosynthesis. RESULTS: Here, we studied the growth of Staphylococcus aureus in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of mersacidin. Transcriptional data revealed an extensive induction of the cell wall stress response, which is partly controlled by the two-component regulatory system VraSR. In contrast to other cell wall-active antibiotics such as vancomycin, very low concentrations of mersacidin (0.15xMIC) were sufficient for induction. Interestingly, the cell wall stress response was equally induced in vancomycin intermediately resistant S. aureus (VISA) and in a highly susceptible strain. Since the transcription of the VraDE ABC transporter genes was induced up to 1700-fold in our experiments, we analyzed the role of VraDE in the response to mersacidin. However, the deletion of the vraE gene did not result in an increased susceptibility to mersacidin compared to the wild type strain. Moreover, the efficacy of mersacidin was not affected by an increased cell wall thickness, which is part of the VISA-type resistance mechanism and functions by trapping the vancomycin molecules in the cell wall before they reach lipid II. Therefore, the relatively higher concentration of mersacidin at the membrane might explain why mersacidin is such a strong inducer of VraSR compared to vancomycin. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, mersacidin appears to be a strong inducer of the cell wall stress response of S. aureus at very low concentrations, which reflects its general mode of action as a cell wall-active peptide as well as its use of a unique target site on lipid II. Additionally, mersacidin does not seem to be a substrate for the resistance transporter VraDE.
TI  - Growth, encystment and survival of Acanthamoeba castellanii grazing on different  bacteria.
AB  - Free-living amoebae of the genus Acanthamoeba are widely distributed in soil and  water collections, where trophozoites (vegetative, multiplicative stages) feed mainly by phagocytosis and thus control bacterial populations in the environment. Here, we examined the growth, encystment and survival of Acanthamoeba castellanii receiving different bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus) in nonnutrient saline. All bacteria assayed induced a dose-dependent proliferative response, in most cases maximized with a bacterial dose of 1 x 10(9) mL(-1); except for M. luteus, trophozoites grew better with viable than with heat-killed bacteria. In addition, Acanthamoeba growth was improved by adding bacteria on alternate days. Single-dose experiments indicated a temporal association between the growth of trophozoite and bacterial consumption, and higher consumption of M. luteus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, bacterial species that allowed the highest trophozoite yields. Long-term Acanthamoeba-bacteria incubation revealed that encystment was significantly delayed by almost all the bacteria assayed (including S. aureus, which elicited a poor growth response) and that the presence of bacteria markedly increased cyst yield; final cyst recovery clearly depended on both the dose and the type of the bacterium given, being much higher with E. coli, M. luteus and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Production of anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus activity from Bacillus subtilis sp. strain B38 newly isolated from soil.
AB  - B38 bacterial strain, isolated from Tunisian soil showed a strong antimicrobial activity. Based on biochemical characterization and 16S rDNA sequence analysis, B38 strain was identified as Bacillus subtilis. Cell culture supernatant showed antibacterial activity against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus species and several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Antifungal activity against phytopathogenic fungi was also observed. Antibacterial activity production started at early exponential growth phase, and maximum activity was reached at the stationary phase. This antibacterial activity was neither affected by proteases, lipase, and organic solvents, nor by surfactants. It was stable over a wide pH range and still active after autoclaving at 121 degrees C during 20 min. Thin layer chromatography followed by bioautography assay allowed the detection of four active spots with R(f) values of 0.30, 0.47, 0.70, and 0.82. The single spot with R (f) 0.30 showed antifungal activity, whereas the spots with R(f) values of 0.47, 0.70, and 0.82 exhibited antibacterial activity.
TI  - Paenibacillus tyraminigenes sp. nov. isolated from Myeolchi-jeotgal, a traditional Korean salted and fermented anchovy.
AB  - A bacterial strain H3029, a gram-positive, rod-shaped, oxidase-negative, endospore-forming bacterium that characteristically produces tyramine from tyrosine, was isolated from a Myeolchi-jeotgal, a traditional Korean salted and fermented anchovy (Engraulis japonicus). The H3029 strain showed a high ability to produce 4140 microg/ml of tyramine from the culture broth containing 5000 microg/ml tyrosine. On the other hand, the strain produced a relatively low level of other putrefactive amines, at 973 microg/ml of putrescine and 147 microg/ml of cadaverine from the media, with each 5000 microg/ml of ornithine hydrochloride and lysine hydrochloride. The H3029 strain produced no detectable level of histamine (detection limit of 4 microg/ml) from the media containing 5000 microg/ml of histidine hydrochloride. Meanwhile, tyramine, the main product of the strain, showed the antimicrobial activity at the level of over 1 mg/disk against Staphylococcus aureus by agar diffusion test, and the mutagenicity in Ames test at 0.1 mg/plate using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA1535. On the basis of the polyphasic taxonomic study, the H3029(T) strain was assigned a novel species of the genus Paenibacillus as Paenibacillus tyraminigenes sp. nov. The type strain of which is strain H3029(T) (=KCTC 10694BP(T)).
TI  - [Investigation on species composition of cockroaches and bacteria-carrying on their bodies in five cities of Hainan].
AB  - "ZA-type" cages were used to capture cockroaches in 267 sites of 5 cities in Hainan. Species were identified and bacteria were isolated by routine method. 441 cockroaches were collected and identified as five species belonging to two genera, 75.3% being Periplaneta americana. More cockroaches were found in sewerage. Bacteria were detected from 82.4% of cockroaches, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp, Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella sp, Bacillus proteus and sort of mycetes. Therefore, the dominant species is Periplaneta americana in Hainan, and the high bacteria-carrying behavior of cockroaches indicates its importance in disease transmission.
TI  - Adrenal gland hemorrhage in patients with fatal bacterial infections.
AB  - A wide spectrum of adrenal gland pathology is seen during bacterial infections. Hemorrhage is particularly associated with meningococcemia, while abscesses have been described with several neonatal infections. We studied adrenal gland histopathology of 65 patients with bacterial infections documented in a variety of tissues by using immunohistochemistry. The infections diagnosed included Neisseria meningitidies, group A streptococcus, Rickettsia rickettsii, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Ehrlichia sp., Bacillus anthracis, Leptospira sp., Clostridium sp., Klebsiella sp., Legionella sp., Yersinia pestis, and Treponema pallidum. Bacteria were detected in the adrenal of 40 (61%) cases. Adrenal hemorrhage was present in 39 (60%) cases. Bacteria or bacterial antigens were observed in 31 (79%) of the cases with adrenal hemorrhage including 14 with N. meningitidis, four with R. rickettsii, four with S. pneumoniae, three with group A streptococcus, two with S. aureus, two with B. anthracis, one with T. pallidum, and one with Legionella sp. Bacterial antigens were observed in nine of 26 non-hemorrhagic adrenal glands that showed inflammatory foci (four cases), edema (two cases), congestion (two cases), or necrosis (one case). Hemorrhage is the most frequent adrenal gland pathology observed in fatal bacterial infections. Bacteria and bacterial antigens are frequently seen in adrenal glands with hemorrhage and may play a pathogenic role. Although N. meningitidis is the most frequent bacteria associated with adrenal gland pathology, a broad collection of bacteria can also cause adrenal lesions.
TI  - Effects of Rosa rugosa petals on intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The effects of pulverized petal of Rosa rugosa on the growth of 10 species of intestinal and pathogenic bacteria were investigated. Growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli was not affected by the addition of the petal in plate cultivation. However, the growth of Bacteroides vulgatus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus was completely inhibited by the addition of 0.1, 0.5, 0.1, and 0.05% (w/v) of the petal respectively. In liquid cultivation, the addition of the petal (0.5%) stimulated the growth of Bifidobacterium breve and slightly inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus salivarius. But the growth of E. coli, S. aureus, B. cereus, and Salmonella sp. was inhibited by nearly 50%. Hydrolyzable tannins isolated from R. rugosa, rugosin D, and tellimagradin II showed antibacterial activities against E. coli, S. aureus, B. cereus, and Salmonella sp., but little or no effect against Bif. breve and L. salivarius. R. rugosa petal showed selective antibacterial activities against intestinal and pathogenic bacteria, and the selectivity resembled that of prebiotics such as oligosaccharides and dietary fiber. Hydrolyzable tannins in R. rugosa, such as rugosin D and tellimagradin II, must be active constituents.
TI  - Two new members of streptothricin class antibiotics from Streptomyces qinlingensis sp. nov.
AB  - Four streptothricin-group antibiotics (1~4) were isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces qinlingensis sp. nov. Along with the known antibiotics streptothricins F (1) and D (3), two new members of this class (2, 4) were identified as 12-carbamoyl derivatives of 1 and 3, respectively, mainly by analysis of the IR, HR-MS and NMR spectral data. The antibacterial activities of 1~4 against Escherichia coli (MICs 3.1, 25.0, 3.1 and 12.5 microg/ml), Bacillus subtilis (MICs 6.3, 25.0, 3.1 and 50 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (MICs 12.5, >100.0, 6.3, >100.0 microg/ml), Bacillus cereus (MICs 25.0, 50.0, 25.0 and 50.0 microg/ml) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MICs 50.0, >100.0, 50.0, >100.0 microg/ml) were assayed by micro-broth dilution. The results based on MIC data indicated that 2 and 4 exhibited significantly less potent antibacterial activities when compared to that of 1 and 3.
TI  - Purification of a lectin from Eugenia uniflora L. seeds and its potential antibacterial activity.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this work was to analyse the antimicrobial properties of a purified lectin from Eugenia uniflora L. seeds. METHODS AND RESULTS: The E. uniflora lectin (EuniSL) was isolated from the seed extract and purified by ion-exchange chromatography in DEAE-Sephadex with a purification factor of 11.68. The purified lectin showed a single band on denaturing electrophoresis, with a molecular mass of 67 kDa. EuniSL agglutinated rabbit and human erythrocytes with a higher specificity for rabbit erythrocytes. The haemagglutination was not inhibited by the tested carbohydrates but glycoproteins exerted a strong inhibitory action. The lectin proved to be thermo resistant with the highest stability at pH 6.5 and divalent ions did not affect its activity. EuniSL demonstrated a remarkable nonselective antibacterial activity. EuniSL strongly inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella sp. with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1.5 microg ml(-1), and moderately inhibited the growth of Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus sp. and Escherichia coli with a MIC of 16.5 microg ml(-1). CONCLUSIONS: EuniSL was found to be effective against bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The strong antibacterial activity of the studied lectin indicates a high potential for clinical microbiology and therapeutic applications.
TI  - Biological activity of phenylpropionic acid isolated from a terrestrial Streptomycetes.
AB  - The strain ANU 6277 was isolated from laterite soil and identified as Streptomyces sp. closely related to Streptomyces albidoflavus cluster by 16S rRNA analysis. The cultural, morphological and physiological characters of the strain were recorded. The strain exhibited resistance to chloramphenicol, penicillin and streptomycin. It had the ability to produce enzymes such as amylase and chitinase. A bioactive compound was isolated from the strain at stationary phase of culture and identified as 3-phenylpropionic acid (3-PPA) by FT-IR, EI-MS, 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectral studies. It exhibited antimicrobial activity against different bacteria like Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. flourescens, Staphylococcus aureus and some fungi including Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, Candida albicans, Fusarium oxysporum, F. udum and Penicillium citrinum. The antifungal activity of 3-PPA of the strain was evaluated in in vivo and in vitro conditions against Fusarium udum causing wilt disease in pigeon pea. The compound 3-PPA is an effective antifungal agent when compared to tricyclozole (fungicide) to control wilt caused by F. udum, but it exhibited less antifungal activity than carbendazim.
TI  - Studies on terpenoids produced by actinomycetes: oxaloterpins A, B, C, D, and E,  diterpenes from Streptomyces sp. KO-3988.
AB  - Following screening for terpenoids produced by Streptomyces sp. KO-3988, five new diterpenes named oxaloterpins A (1), B (2), C (3), D (4), and E (5) together with the known viguiepinone (6) were isolated from culture broth, and their structures were established on the basis of extensive NMR and MS analyses. The absolute configuration of oxaloterpin A was determined by the modified Mosher's method as 3 R, 5 S, 8 S, 10 R, 13 S.
TI  - Bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances from Campylobacter spp.
AB  - Twenty-five Campylobacter isolates were screened for production of antimicrobial  substances using a deferred antagonism assay. Sixteen isolates showed activity against either Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis or Candida albicans. The inhibitory activity was sensitive to treatment with pronase E, trypsin and pepsin, suggesting that the antimicrobial compound(s) are proteinaceous. Activity spectra of isolates included S. aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus sp., Bacillus subtilis, a drug-resistant clinical isolate of S. aureus and one isolate of C. albicans. Producing isolates showed cross-immunity and inhibitory activity was only observed on solid media. The findings of this study suggest that Campylobacter produces proteinaceous inhibitory substances.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of two antitumour agents and ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and the acetate form of its copper(II) chelate.
AB  - Some copper chelates have potent antitumour activity, and in some cases also the  free ligands have activity in vivo. Yet, little is known about their antimicrobial properties. Copper(II) chelates of the thiosemicarbazones of a-N-heterocyclic carboxaldehydes constitute one important group of such agents, also their ligands having marked antitumour activity. Both the ligands and chelates inhibit ribonucleotide reductase. Some ligands have been or are under clinical trials as antineoplastic agents. I report here a study on the antimicrobial properties of the prototype compounds of this group, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and its copper(II) chelate. They were tested against nine microbes, including bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus lactis), yeasts (Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and one mold (Aspergillus niger). Two clinical isolates of Bacillus sp. and one reference strain were also studied. Both the ligand and the chelate had marked activity. The ligand displayed considerable activity against all bacteria except for S. lactis, and its activity against E. coli and P. aeruginosa was that high that practical applications might be considued. It was highly active against A. niger and moderately active against C. albicans. The chelate was highly active against S. epidermidis and S. cerevisiae. Both compounds inhibited the clinical isolates markedly. Since some related ligands have been or are in clinical trials on humans or are entering them, their route to clinical use, also as antimicrobials, might be much more straightforward than that of substances, whose toxicity in humans is wholly unexplored.
TI  - Molecular characterization of antimicrobial compound produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus AA11.
AB  - Approximately 63 strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus were isolated from Egyptian home-made cheese and examined for production of antagonism. Only eight strains demonstrated inhibitory activity against spoilage microorganisms (i.e. Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus) and pathogens (i.e. E. coli, Salmonella sp. and Shigella sp.). Lactobacillus acidophilus AA11 produced higher antimicrobial activity with a wide range of inhibition. The agent AA11 was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and retained full activity after 30 min at 100 degrees C. Activity against sensitive cells was bactericidal but not bacteriolytic. The compound was produced during growth phase and could be extracted from the culture supernatant fluids with n-butanol. 12% SDS-PAGE analysis of 40% ammonium sulphate precipitated agent showed two peptides with molecular weights of approximately 36 kDa and approximately 29 kDa. No plasmid was identified in Lactobacillus acidophilus AA11 indicating that the genes encoding the inhibitory agent were located on the chromosome. These characteristics identify the inhibitory substance as a bacteriocin, designated acidocin AA11 and confer the agent an application potential as a biopreservative.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and the major components of the essential oil of Plectranthus cylindraceus.
AB  - AIMS: The traditional uses of the aerial parts of fresh Plectranthus cylindraceus by the Dhofaris in Oman were investigated on the basis of antimicrobial properties and composition of its herb oil. METHODS AND RESULTS: The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of the herb oil of P. cylindraceus against human pathogenic bacteria and yeast were assessed using the broth microdilution method, and the percentage growth inhibition of fungi was determined according to the poisoned food technique. The oil exhibited good activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Candida albicans with MIC values in the range of 7.8-62.5 microg ml(-1) and also inhibited the growth of Microsporum canis, Microsporum gypseum, Trichophyton rubrum, Alternaria alternata, Bipolaris sp., Curvularia lunata, Fusarium oxysporum and Stemphylium solani for about a week at 250 microg ml(-1). The two most abundant components of the oil were identified as carvacrol (46.8%) and alpha-terpinolene (18.2%) based on gas chromatography-mass spectra (GC-MS) and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The oil has a pleasant odour and showed broad spectrum antimicrobial activity. Such bioactivity could be attributed in part to carvacrol. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study has demonstrated the broad spectrum antimicrobial activity of the herb oil of P. cylindraceus as well as the organic composition of this plant extract. This study provides scientific insight into the ancient practice of utilizing P. cylindraceus as a fragrant disinfectant.
TI  - Macrolactins O-R, glycosylated 24-membered lactones from Bacillus sp. AH159-1.
AB  - In the course of screening for inhibitors of Staphylococcus aureus peptide deformylase, four new glycosylated macrolactin compounds, macrolactins O ( 1), P ( 2), Q ( 3), and R ( 4), along with the known macrolactins B ( 5) and C ( 6), have been isolated from the liquid cultures of Bacillus sp. AH159-1. The structures of compounds 1- 4 were assigned on the basis of MS and NMR data. They inhibited S. aureus peptide deformylase and also showed antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - [Studies on purification and properties of antagonistic protein from bacteria SS02 of Paenibacillus daejeonensis].
AB  - The antifungal, anti-bacterical, anti-brine shrimp activities of SD22 isolated from Paenibacillus daejeonensis Bacteria SS02 were studied. The separation steps included ultracentrifugation, ultrafiltration and (NH4)2SO4 fractional precipitation, further purification was performed by SephadexG-75 and DEAE-32 chromatography. Its molecular weight determined by SDS-PAGE was 56.0 kD and its isoelectfic point was 6.4. SD22 was thermostable to some extent and stable to ultraviolet, but sensitive to some of the enzyme. SD22 could kill most pathogens from propagation, such as Rhizoctonia cerealis, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum Physalospora piricala, Trichodema viride, Gliocladium viride, Curvularia leaf spot, Fusarium sp, Fusarium head blight, Beauveria Bassiana, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis , Candidal vaginitis, Fusarium oxysporum Schl. emend. Sayder & Hansem et al. The results will be helpful to find out a novel antifungal protein.
TI  - Flavonoids of Lonchocarpus montanus A.M.G. Azevedo and biological activity.
AB  - The analysis of root extracts from Lonchocarpus montanus A.M.G. Azevedo resulted  in the isolation of twenty three compounds chiefly flavonoids of which five (four flavonoids and one benzophenone) are described for the first time. The molecular structures of the new compounds (1-5) were determined through spectral analysis (UV, IR, MS and NMR) as being: 2'-hydroxy-8-(alpha,alpha-dimethylallyl)-2", 2"-dimethylpyrano-(5",6":3',4')-dibenzoylmethane (1), 2'-methoxy-8-(alpha,alpha-dimethylallyl)-2", 2"-dimethylpyrano-(5",6":3',4')-dibenzoylmethane (2), 4'-methoxy-2",2"-dimethylpyrano-(5",6":8,7)-flavone (3), 2"-(1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl)-furano-(4",5":8,7)-flavone (4) and [2'-methoxy-furano-(4",5":3',4')-phenyl]-phenylmethanone (5). Additionally, fifteen fatty acids were detected through GC-MS analysis of the corresponding methyl esters [(CH3)2CH(CH2)8COOH and CH3(CH2)nCOOH (n = 6, 12-24)]. Quantitative RP-HPLC showed that the most abundant flavonoids in the petroleum ether and dichloromethane extracts were pongamol (19%) and lanceolatine B (8.0%), respectively. In the bioautography assay, the extracts, pongamol (9), lanceolatine B (10), isolonchocarpin (14), derriobtusone A (17) and medicarpine (18) were active against Staphylococcus aureus whereas 9 also against Bacillus subtilis and Cladosporium cladosporioides. Compound 1, 2",2"-dimethylpyrano-(5",6":8,7)-flavone (11) and furano-(1200,1300:7,8)- 4'-methoxy flavone (12) were active against Fusarium oxysporium whereas 11 also against Rhizopus orizae. The extracts, compounds 9, 10, 17 and (E)-7-O-methoxypongamol (23) displayed high toxicity in the brine shrimp lethality assay.
TI  - Walnut (Juglans regia L.) leaves: phenolic compounds, antibacterial activity and  antioxidant potential of different cultivars.
AB  - Different cultivars of walnut (Juglans regia L.) leaves (Cv. Lara, Franquette, Mayette, Marbot, Mellanaise and Parisienne) grown in Portugal, were investigated in what concerns phenolic compounds and antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. Phenolics analysis was performed by reversed-phase HPLC/DAD and 10 compounds were identified and quantified: 3- and 5-caffeoylquinic acids, 3- and 4-p-coumaroylquinic acids, p-coumaric acid, quercetin 3-galactoside, quercetin 3-pentoside derivative, quercetin 3-arabinoside, quercetin 3-xyloside and quercetin 3-rhamnoside. The antimicrobial capacity was screened against Gram positive (Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and fungi (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans). Walnut leaves selectively inhibited the growth of Gram positive bacteria, being B. cereus the most susceptible one (MIC 0.1mg/mL). Gram negative bacteria and fungi were resistant to the extracts at 100mg/mL. Lara walnut leaves were also submitted to antibacterial assays using 18 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus sp. Antioxidant activity was accessed by the reducing power assay, the scavenging effect on DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radicals and beta-carotene linoleate model system. In a general way, all of the studied walnut leaves cultivars presented high antioxidant activity (EC(50) values lower than 1mg/mL), being Cv. Lara the most effective one.
TI  - Application of real-time quantitative PCR for the detection of selected bacterial pathogens during municipal wastewater treatment.
AB  - Bacteria were detected at five stages of municipal wastewater treatment using TaqMan(R) real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Thirteen probe and primer sets were tested for diverse pathogens that may be present in wastewater, including Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Helicobacter pylori, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp., and Staphylococcus aureus. The sensitivity of the assay was 100 fg of genomic DNA (=22 gene copies), based on a standard curve generated using A. hydrophila purified DNA. Samples from five stages of wastewater treatment were collected, including raw wastewater, primary effluents, mixed liquor, waste activated sludge and final effluents. In duplicate samples, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, C. perfringens and E. faecalis were detected throughout the wastewater process, and their numbers decreased by 3.52-3.98, 4.23-4.33, 3.15-3.39, and 3.24 orders of magnitude respectively, between the raw wastewater and final effluent stage. This qPCR method was effective for the detection of pathogens in wastewater and confirmed that the risk of exposure to pathogens in the wastewater discharge was well within the Environment Canada guidelines.
TI  - A detailed analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA gene segments for the diagnosis of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes contain nine "hypervariable regions" (V1-V9) that demonstrate considerable sequence diversity among different bacteria. Species-specific sequences within a given hypervariable region constitute useful targets for diagnostic assays and other scientific investigations. No single region can differentiate among all bacteria; therefore, systematic studies that compare the relative advantage of each region for specific diagnostic goals are needed. We characterized V1-V8 in 110 different bacterial species including common blood borne pathogens, CDC-defined select agents and environmental microflora. Sequence similarity dendrograms were created for hypervariable regions V1-V8, and for selected combinations of regions or short segments within individual hypervariable regions that might be appropriate for DNA probing and real-time PCR. We determined that V1 best differentiated among Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus sp. V2 and V3 were most suitable for distinguishing all bacterial species to the genus level except for closely related enterobacteriaceae. V2 best distinguished among Mycobacterium species and V3 among Haemophilus species. The 58 nucleotides-long V6 could distinguish among most bacterial species except enterobacteriaceae. V6 was also noteworthy for being able to differentiate among all CDC-defined select agents including Bacillus anthracis, which differed from B. cereus by a single polymorphism. V4, V5, V7 and V8 were less useful targets for genus or species-specific probes. The hypervariable sequence-specific dendrograms and the "MEGALIGN" files provided online will be highly useful tools for designing specific probes and primers for molecular assays to detect pathogenic bacteria, including select agents.
TI  - Chromosomal-gene-mediated inhibition of intestinal and foodborne pathogens by Lactobacillus acidophilus AA11.
AB  - Approximately 63 strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus were isolated from Egyptian home-made cheese and examined for production of antagonism.

TI  - Superficial corneal foreign body: laboratory and epidemiologic aspects.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine by bacterioscopy and culture the microorganisms carried by  corneal foreign body and their sensitivity to antibiotics by antibiotic sensitivity test. METHODS: A prospective study was carried out and information was collected on 101 patients who presented with corneal foreign body at the Sao Paulo Hospital Eye Emergency Service. Prior to any treatment, a sample of the ipsilateral inferior conjunctival fornix and the foreign body were collected and immersed in thioglycolate broth. Samples were sown on solid culture media including blood, chocolate and Sabouraud agar. Bacterioscopic examination using Gram and Giemsa staining and sensitivity test were performed. Positive foreign body culture results were compared to ipsilateral conjunctival fornix culture to exclude possible normal flora growth. RESULTS: Approximately 92% of patients were males with a mean age of 35 years and in 62.4% (95% confidence interval: 52.2-71.8%) had the right eye was affected. Foreign body positive cultures were achieved in 32.7% (95% confidence interval: 23.7-42.7%) of the cases. The microorganisms isolated from the foreign body culture were identified as: Streptococcus, alpha-hemolytic (n=4), Staphylococcus aureus (n=4), Staphylococcus, coagulase-negative (n=4), Corynebacterium xerosis (n=3), unidentified Gram-positive bacillus (n=2), Moraxella sp (n=1), Serratia sp (n=1), Acynetobacter sp (n=1). The microbial sensitivity test showed that 95% of the cases were sensitive to chloramphenicol and 90% were sensitive to ciprofloxacin, these being antibiotics used in our routine service. CONCLUSION: Superficial corneal foreign body acts as important contaminant vector and the great majority of isolated bacteria were sensitive to the antibiotic prophylaxis used in the treatment.
TI  - [New container of sample: role in the reduction of bacterial contamination of standard platelet units].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of unstable blood products constitutes today  the most frequent infectious risk transmitted by blood transfusion. Platelet concentrates are often incrimineted. As responsible germs are in general of cutaneous origin, a sample procedure with diversion of the first 20 ml during blood donation is studied. The aim of this study is to evaluate the results of this technique on bacterial contamination rate of standard platelet units prepared at the regional blood transfusion center in Casablanca. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A comparative study of two types of sample pockets is made: 500 Standard Platelet concentrates (CPS) are prepared after collection using standard triple bags (Baxter) (group 1) and 560 pockets of CPS were prepared after collection using triple bags with Sample Diversion Pouch sampling system for elimination of the first 20 ml of donation (Macopharma and Terumo) (group 2). The skin was disinfected in two times with alcohol 70%. The bacteriological study was made in the two groups at the third day of conservation. RESULTS: Six CPS of group 1 were contaminated, of which five were staphylococci coagulase negative and one bacillus sp. Six CPS of group 2 were contaminated, of which five were staphylococci coagulase negative and one staphylococcus aureus. The bacteria isolated were those of cutaneous flora at 100%. Diversion of first 20 ml of blood donation results in a 16.6% reduction in bacterial contamination of CPS (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: The non-significant reduction in the prevalence of the bacterial infection of CP formulates the problem of the indication of the sampling devices with derivation of first 20 ml during blood collection.
TI  - Kolokosides A-D: triterpenoid glycosides from a Hawaiian isolate of Xylaria sp.
AB  - Four new triterpenoid glycosides, kolokosides A-D (1-4), along with the known compound 19,20-epoxycytochalasin N, were isolated from cultures of a Hawaiian wood-decay fungus (Xylaria sp.). The structures and relative configurations of 1-4 were determined primarily by analysis of NMR data, and the absolute configuration of 1 was assigned by application of the exciton chirality method. Compound 1 exhibited activity against Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the broad bean extracts on resistant bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of four different extracts (ethanol, methanol, distilled water and 2-Methylbutan-1-01) obtained from different parts of broad bean (Vicia faba L.) such as flowers, leaves, seeds and seed hulls and were tested against Bacillus subtilis, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella peneumoniua, Shigella sp. and Micrococcus pyogenes. Better antimicrobial activity was observed with the leaves of broad bean sterile distilled water extract with a zone of inhibition in between 13-32 mm. Flower and seed hull showed by Escherichia coli, Shigella sp., Bacillus subtilis, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus pyogenes a zone of inhibition in between 15-29 and 14-19 mm, respectively. Leaves, seed hulls and flowers of broad bean with ethanol extract showed by Escherichia coli a zone of inhibition in between 25-34, 15-17 and 15 mm, respectively. Flower with ethanol extract had a zone of inhibition in between 15-16 mm by Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus pyogenes, respectively. Different parts of Broad Bean with methanol and 2-Methylbutan-l-01 extract did not shown any antimicrobial affects.
TI  - Chilling and cultivar type affect the diversity of bacterial endophytes colonizing sweet pepper (Capsicum anuum L.).
AB  - A climate chamber experiment was conducted to assay the effect of low temperatures (chilling) on the diversity of bacteria colonizing the endospheres of two thermophilic sweet pepper (Capsicum anuum L.) cultivars, Milder Spiral and Ziegenhorn Bello. Structural diversity was analyzed by 16S rRNA-based terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis and by the generation of 16S rRNA gene libraries to determine dominant community members in T-RFLP profiles. Cultivable community members colonizing lines Milder Spiral and Ziegenhorn Bello were identified by 16S rRNA gene analysis. T-RFLP profiles and 16S rRNA gene libraries revealed a high heterogeneity of community composition due to chilling and suggested further the existence of cultivar-specific communities. The majority of isolates obtained from the cultivar Milder Spiral were assigned as high-G+C Gram-positive bacteria (Microbacterium sp., Micrococcus sp., Rhodococcus sp.) and Firmicutes (Staphylococcus sp.). Of the isolated endophytes obtained from cultivar Zeigenhorn Bello, 93% were affiliated with Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus sp. (Firmicutes). The experimental set-up was suited to demonstrate that chilling and cultivar type can influence the diversity of bacterial endophytes colonizing sweet pepper. We propose additional chilling experiments to investigate the effect of chilling on functional, plant-beneficial abilities of bacterial endophytes associated with low-temperature-sensitive crops, such as sweet pepper.
TI  - The smr gene resides on a novel plasmid pSP187 identified in a Staphylococcus pasteuri isolate recovered from unpasteurized milk.
AB  - This work describes a novel plasmid pSP187 (5550 bp) carrying the small multidrug resistance determinant smr encoding resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs). pSP187 was identified in a Staphylococcus pasteuri isolate recovered from bulk milk in a dairy cattle herd in Norway. Sequence analysis revealed 6 putative ORFs in addition to the smr gene within a cassette with identical genetic organization to that found in the pSK41-like Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pTZ22. A protein homology search suggested the gene product of ORF7 to be a putative replication initiation protein, while ORF2 was predicted to encode a protein homologous to members of FtsK/SpoIIIE cell division-DNA segregation protein families. Sequence similarities to some initiator proteins of rolling circle replicons (RCR) indicated that pSP187 uses a RCR mode of replication, supported by the detection of intermediate ssDNA using S1 nuclease treatment and hybridization analysis. Interestingly, a 30-bp sequence found upstream from ORF7 showed high similarity to other dyad symmetry motifs proposed as putative double-strand origins of replication in the plasmids pGI3 (Bacillus thuringiensis), pSTK1 (Bacillus stearothermophilus), and pER1-2 (Streptococcus thermophilus). IN CONCLUSION: The novel smr-containing plasmid pSP187 is the first member of RCR group VI to be identified in a Staphylococcus sp.
TI  - Purification and characterization of Heteroscorpine-1 (HS-1) toxin from Heterometrus laoticus scorpion venom.
AB  - Crude venom from Thai giant scorpion, Heterometrus laoticus, most commonly found  in the northeastern area of Thailand, was evaluated for PD50 (paralytic dose 50) activities from abdominal injection to cricket (Gryllus sp.) and activities against various kinds of microorganisms. It exhibited good results in disc diffusion assay for Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. After purification, toxin showed acceptable results for PD50 determination in entrapped cricket as well as inhibitory activity against B. subtilis, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa with activities over 300 times higher than that of the crude venom. The purified fraction was showed to contain a single band in SDS-PAGE. MALDI-TOF-MS/MS analysis showed one peak of major protein with 8293Da. Partial amino acid sequence show high homology to Scorpine-a polypeptide toxin family with potassium channel blocking and defensin activity. The novel toxin was named "Heteroscorpine-1" (HS-1) as the first Scorpine from genus Heterometrus. After full length determination by PCR, HS-1 gene was found to be composed of two exons, separated by an intron. Deduction revealed 95 amino acid residues with 19 residues as the leading sequence. It showed about 80% similarity to Panscorpine and Opiscorpine.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some ethnomedicinal plants used by Paliyar tribe from Tamil Nadu, India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial activity of 18 ethnomedicinal plant extracts were evaluated against nine bacterial strains (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Ervinia sp, Proteus vulgaris) and one fungal strain (Candida albicans). The collected ethnomedicinal plants were used in folk medicine in the treatment of skin diseases, venereal diseases, respiratory problems and nervous disorders. METHODS: Plants were collected from Palni hills of Southern Western Ghats and the ethnobotanical data were gathered from traditional healers who inhabit the study area. The hexane and methanol extracts were obtained by cold percolation method and the antimicrobial activity was found using paper disc diffusion method. All microorganisms were obtained from Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India. RESULTS: The results indicated that out of 18 plants, 10 plants exhibited antimicrobial activity against one or more of the tested microorganisms at three different concentrations of 1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg/disc. Among the plants tested, Acalypha fruticosa, Peltophorum pterocarpum, Toddalia asiatica,Cassia auriculata, Punica granatum and Syzygium lineare were most active. The highest antifungal activity was exhibited by methanol extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum and Punica granatum against Candida albicans. CONCLUSION: This study evaluated the antimicrobial activity of the some ethnomedicinal plants used in folkloric medicine. Compared to hexane extract, methanol extract showed significant activity against tested organisms. This study also showed that Toddalia asiatica, Syzygium lineare, Acalypha fruticosa and Peltophorum pterocarpum could be potential sources of new antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Screening for anti-infective properties of several medicinal plants of the Mauritians flora.
AB  - Several plants of the Mauritian flora alleged to possess anti-infective properties were studied against different strains of pathogenic bacteria and fungi. The grounded dried plant materials were extracted with different extractants and screened for anti-microbial activity using the disk diffusion and the micro-dilution techniques. Preliminary screening revealed that the methanol extracts were most active. Salmonella enteritidis, Enterobacter cloacae and Bacillus subtilis were the three test organisms, which were found to be susceptible to all the crude methanolic extracts of the different plants investigated (100% susceptibility), followed by Escherichia coli (57.1%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (57.1%), and Staphylococcus aureus (28.6%). The lowest minimum inhibitory concentration recorded for the different crude methanol extracts against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis and the mould fungus Candida albicans were 500, 1000, 125, 250, 1000 and 125 micro g/ml, respectively. Bioautography using Cladosporium cucumerinum revealed that dichloromethane (DCM) extracts had the highest activity against the phytopathogenic fungus. It was also noted that the DCM extracts of Michelia champaca and Antidesma madagascariense yielded the maximum number of growth inhibiting compounds against Cladosporium cucumerinum. Activity of the different crude extracts was also investigated against several phytopathogenic filamentous fungi, Colletotrichum glocosporoides, Rhizoctonia solani, Sclerotinia sclerotium, Guignardia sp. and Fusarium oxysporum. It was found that crude hexane extracts as well as crude DCM extracts exhibited marked activity against several strains of fungi, especially Colletotrichum glocosporoides, Sclerotinia sclerotium and Guignardia sp.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of some unsymmetrical diorganyltellurium(IV) dichlorides.
AB  - Six unsymmetrical diorganyltellurium(IV) dichlorides RR'TeCl2 (where R= phenacyl-, 1-naphthacyl-, and styrylacyl- and R' = p-methoxyphenyl, p-hydroxyphenyl-, and 3-methyl-4-hydoxyphenyl-) were tested for their antibacterial activity against gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Salmonella sp.) bacteria. Antibacterial activity was measured by disk diffusion method. Inhibition zones demonstrated that all the compounds showed good activity against gram-negative strains. Phenacyl (3-methyl-4-hydroxyphenyl) tellurium(IV) dichloride and naphthacyl (3-methyl-4-hydroxyphenyl) tellurium(IV) dichloride showed significant activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative strains. Among the tested compounds, the former exhibited maximum activity against gram-positive bacteria, while the latter against all the bacteria under study and styrylacyl (p-methoxyphenyl) tellurium(IV) dichloride against all the three gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Immunohistochemical evidence of Clostridium sp, Staphylococcus aureus, and group  A Streptococcus in severe soft tissue infections related to injection drug use.
AB  - Severe soft tissue infections are caused by either single or multiple microorganisms. We performed a retrospective immunohistochemical (IHC) study on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded soft tissue samples from 20 injection drug users who were part of a cluster of severe illness and death after skin and soft tissue infections in Scotland and Ireland in 2000. The IHC assays used antibodies against Clostridium sp, Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococci, and Bacillus anthracis. Intact bacilli and granular Clostridium antigen staining in areas with necrosis, edema, and inflammation were observed in skin, fascia, or muscle samples of 12 (60%) patients. A variety of clostridia were isolated from affected soft tissues in 10 IHC-positive cases. Staphylococcus aureus antigens were observed in 3 cases including 1 where S aureus was isolated, 1 with negative cultures, and 1 where mixed cultures were obtained. Group A streptococcal antigens were observed in 1 case in which Streptococcus pyogenes and S aureus were isolated. By using IHC, we detected different bacteria in archival soft tissue samples from patients with severe skin and soft tissue infections. Immunohistochemical assays can be of great diagnostic value, particularly for bacteria such as Clostridium sp, which are difficult to isolate because of their anaerobic fastidious growth requirements.
TI  - A comparative study on the effect of plant extracts with the antibiotics on organisms of hospital origin.
AB  - Thirty five plants belonging to twenty families were studied for their antimicrobial activity. Among the plants tested, 43 % showed antimicrobial activity. Fifteen plants belonging to 10 families exhibited activity against gram positive bacteria and gram negative bacteria. Four plants namely Azadirachta indica, Garadenia jasminoides, Magnifera indica, and Wrightia tinctora showed an appreciable activity against the gram positive bacteria and seven plants against gram negative organisms. Leaf extract of Tabermontana coronaria showed a maximum zone of inhibition (24 mm) against Staphylococcus aureus and the leaf extract of Sida cordifolia showed a maximum zone (20 mm) against Corynebacteriun diphtheriae. Mentha piperanta gave a maximum zone size against E,coli (22 mm) and Vibrio cholerae (20mm). The inhibitory percentage of the leaf extracts against various pathogens were observed to be Staphylococcus aureus (40%), E.coli (28%), Shigella sp (25%), Salmonella sp (22%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis (20%), Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus vulgaris (17%), Vibrio cholera (14%) and Corynebacterium diphtheriae (11%). The results suggested that the leaf extracts of various plants has significant antibacterial activity against the tested microorganisms. The present study is done to compare the activity of the plant extracts with the activity of currently used antibiotics against the selected organisms.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activities of Mexican tarragon (Tagetes lucida).
AB  - Mexican tarragon (Tagetes lucida Cv. Asteraceae: Campanulatae) is an important, nutritious plant and an effective herbal medicine. Seven coumarins, 7,8-dihydroxycoumarin (4), umbelliferone (7-hydroxycoumarin) (5), scoparone (6,7-dimethoxycoumarin) (7), esculetin (6,7-dihydroxycoumarin) (11), 6-hydroxy-7-methoxycoumarin (12), herniarin (7-methoxycoumarin) (13), and scopoletin (6-methoxy-7-hydroxycoumarin) (14), and three flavonoids, patuletin (18), quercetin (19), and quercetagetin (20), were isolated from CH2Cl2 and MeOH extracts from aerial parts of T. lucida. In addition, 6,7-diacetoxy coumarin (15), 6-methoxy-7-acetylcoumarin (16), and 6-acetoxy-7-methoxycoumarin (17) derivatives were synthesized. 8-Methoxypsoralen (1), 8-acetyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (2), 7,8-dihydroxy-6-meth-oxycoumarin (3), 6,7-dimethoxy-4-methylcoumarin (6), 5,7-dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (8), 4-hydroxycoumarin (9), 4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethylcoumarin (10), naringenin (21), glycoside-7-rhamnonaringin (22), and rutin (23) were commercially obtained (Sigma-Aldrich). All of these compounds and extracts (M1 and M2) were assayed against bacteria and fungi. The antibacterial activity was determined on Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella sp., Shigella boydii, Shigella sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterolitica, Vibrio cholerae (three El Tor strains, CDC-V12, clinic case, and INDRE-206, were obtained from contaminated water), and V. cholerae (NO-O1). The evaluated fungi were Aspergillus niger, Penicillium notatum, Fusarium moniliforme, Fusarium sporotrichum, Rhizoctonia solani, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The most active compounds against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria were the dihydroxylated coumarins 3 and 4. In addition, 2-4, 6, 7, and 11 showed an interesting activity against V. cholerae, a key bacterium in the contaminated water; 2-4 were the most active. Coumarins were the most effective compounds against Gram-negative bacteria. The extract MeOH/CH2Cl2 (1: 4) M2 at 0.4 microg/disk inhibited the growth of E. coli and P. mirabilis (40%), K. pneumoniae (31.1%), Salmonella sp. (35.5%), and Shigella sp. (0%) at 72 h of culture. The dimethoxy compounds 6 and 7 showed a strong activity against fungal strains, especially T. mentagrophytes and R. solani (100% of inhibition at 125.0 and 250.0 microg/mL, respectively).
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of saponins from Medicago sp.: structure-activity relationship.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of saponins from Medicago sativa, M. arborea and M. arabica against a selection of medically important yeasts, Gram-positive and -negative bacteria was investigated. Structure-activity growth inhibitory effects of related prosapogenins and sapogenins are also described. Increasing antibiotic activity was observed going from the saponin extracts to the sapogenin samples, suggesting that the sugar moiety is not important for the antimicrobial efficacy. Activity was especially high against Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis) with M. arabica being the species showing a broader spectrum of action. Discrete antifungal activity was also observed, mainly against Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The observed antimicrobial properties of M. sativa and M. arborea were related to the content of medicagenic acid, while hederagenin seems to contribute to the bioactivity of M. arabica total sapogenins.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activities of Araucaria araucana (Mol.) K. Koch heartwood lignans.
AB  - Five lignans (secoisolariciresinol, pinoresinol, eudesmin, lariciresinol, and lariciresinol-4-methyl ether) were isolated from an MeOH extract from Araucaria araucana (Mol.) K. Koch wood for the first time in this species and their structures determined with spectroscopic methods. The antimicrobial activities of these compounds were determined for the bacteria Citrobacter sp., Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and for the white rooting and staining fungi Mucor miehei, Paecilomyces variotii, Ceratocystis pilifera, Trametes versicolor, and Penicillium notatum, and in addition, the MeOH extract was evaluated against Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, Fusarium moniliforme, F. sporotrichum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The most sensitive bacteria against pinoresinol were the Gram-positive. However, secoisolariciresinol exhibited a significant antifungal activity on fungi of white rooting and wood staining and this compound completely inhibited the mycelial growth of T. versicolor and C. pilifera at 300 and 400 microg per disc, respectively, whereas pinoresinol showed a moderate inhibitory activity. On the other hand, the MeOH extract had the highest activity against rooting and staining and pathogenic fungi as well as T. versicolor, Fusarium spp. and Trichophyton mentagrophytes, inhibiting completely the growth at 400 microg per disc.
TI  - Detection and identification of intestinal pathogenic bacteria by hybridization to oligonucleotide microarrays.
AB  - AIM: To detect the common intestinal pathogenic bacteria quickly and accurately.  METHODS: A rapid (<3 h) experimental procedure was set up based upon the gene chip technology. Target genes were amplified and hybridized by oligonucleotide microarrays. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy strains of bacteria in pure culture belonging to 11 genera were successfully discriminated under comparatively same conditions, and a series of specific hybridization maps corresponding to each kind of bacteria were obtained. When this method was applied to 26 divided cultures, 25 (96.2%) were identified. CONCLUSION: Salmonella sp., Escherichia coli, Shigella sp., Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus sp., Bacillus cereus, Vibrio cholerae, Enterococcus faecalis, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter jejuni can be detected and identified by our microarrays. The accuracy, range, and discrimination power of this assay can be continually improved by adding further oligonucleotides to the arrays without any significant increase of complexity or cost.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Arctium lappa constituents against microorganisms commonly found in endodontic infections.
AB  - This study evaluated in vitro the antimicrobial activity of rough extracts from leaves of Arctium lappa and their phases. The following microorganisms, commonly found in the oral cavity, specifically in endodontic infections, were used: Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis and Candida albicans. The agar-diffusion method allowed detection of the hexanic phase as an inhibitor of microbial growth. Bioautographic assays identified antimicrobial substances in the extract. The results showed the existence, in the rough hexanic phase and in its fractions, of constituents that have retention factors (Rf) in three distinct zones, thereby suggesting the presence of active constituents with chemical structures of different polarities that exhibited specificity against the target microorganisms. It may be concluded that the Arctium lappa constituents exhibited a great microbial inhibition potential against the tested endodontic pathogens.
TI  - Differential activity of a lectin from Solieria filiformis against human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - A lectin isolated from the red alga Solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). The lectin (500 microg/mL) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species Bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species Serratia marcescens, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus sp, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/mL but the lectin (10-1000 microg/mL) had no effect on the growth of the gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and B. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. The purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. It is possible that the interaction of S. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. Growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium B. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/mL. The stimulation of the growth of B. cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/mL), its hapten. Thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. The present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.
TI  - Cultivation of entomopathogenic fungi for the search of antibacterial compounds.
AB  - Entomopathogenic fungi are a rich source of natural bioactive compounds. To establish cultivation conditions which facilitate the production of bioactive compounds and to select good genera among entomopathogenic fungi as the producer, 47 typical entomopathogenic fungi were tested for their ability to produce antibiotic activity. Thirty-eight strains (81%) and 30 strains (64%) of these fungi produced either anti-Bacillus compounds or anti-Staphylococcus compounds, respectively, indicating that the majority of the entomopathogenic fungi tested possessed the ability to produce antibacterial compounds. Using 9 representative strains (Aschersonia sp. HF724, Beauveria bassiana HF338, Cordyceps ramosopulvinata HF746, Metarhizium anisopliae HF293, Metarhizium flavoviride HF698, Nomuraea rileyi HF588, Paecilomyces fumosoroseus HF254, Paecilomyces tenuipes HF419, and Verticillium lecanii HF238), the cultivation conditions in liquid medium were surveyed with respect to the cultivation procedure and medium composition, particularly in terms of the presence or absence of insect-derived materials. At 26 degrees C, M. anisopliae HF293, N. rileyi HF588, and V. lecanii HF238 strains produced clear antibiotic activity against Bacillus and Saccharomyces, but only in the presence of insect-derived materials, suggesting that the production of antibacterial/antifungal compounds by entomopathogenic fungi is triggered by the presence of insect-derived materials.
TI  - Purification, bacteriolytic activity, and specificity of beta-lytic protease from Lysobacter sp. IB-9374.
AB  - Lysobacter sp. IB-9374, which was isolated from soil as a high lysyl endopeptidase-producing strain (Chohnanet al., FEMS Microbiol. Lett., 213, 13-20, 2002), was found to produce a beta-lytic protease capable of lysing gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Microccocuseus, and Bacillus subtilis. The Lysobacter strain secreted the beta-lytic protease into the culture medium at a 2.4-fold higher level than Achromobacter lyticus. The enzyme was highly purified through a series of six steps with a high yield. The enzyme was strongly inhibited by tetraethylene-pentamine and 1,10-phenanthroline. The purified enzyme lysed more efficiently almost all the gram-positive bacteria tested than lysozyme, lysostaphin, and mutanolysin. The enzyme was very similar to Achromobacter beta-lytic protease containing one zinc atom in terms of amino acid composition and N-terminal sequence. The nucleotide sequence revealed that the mature enzyme was composed of 179 amino acid residues with additional 198 amino acids at the amino-terminal end of the enzyme. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mature enzyme coincided with that of the Achromobacter enzyme, although the prepro-region showed a 41% sequence identity with the counterpart. These results indicate that Lysobacter sp. is a useful strain for an efficient large-scale preparation of beta-lytic protease capable of lysing bacteria.
TI  - [Etiology of community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompetent adults].
AB  - In an ideal clinical setting, empiric antimicrobial treatment prescribed in adult community acquired pneumonia (CAP) should be based on national etiological surveillance and in vitro susceptibility assays. Available information about etiology in ambulatory patients and intensive care unit (ICU) patients is scarce, compared to information obtained in hospitalized patients. In studies designed to explore the etiology of pneumonia, no microorganism is detected in 40-50% of patients, a fact that represents limited yields in diagnostic methods. In all settings, Streptococcus pneumoniae is the main respiratory pathogen recovered in adults CAP, being responsible of about 16% of cases among ambulatory patients and about 22% of those admitted to hospital and ICU. About one third of cases are caused by a small group of microorganisms: Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, respiratory viruses, Staphylococcus aureus, gramnegative bacillus, Legionella sp; each one is isolated in less than 10% of cases. In general, microorganism distribution varies scarcely in the following attending settings: ambulatory patients, common wards and ICU. An exception is represented by a higher frequency of gram negative bacillus, S. aureus and Legionella sp in ICU, and of C. pneumoniae in the ambulatory setting. In Chile, CAP etiology in hospitalized adult patients is similar to foreign reports; no systematic information has been collected about the etiology in neither ambulatory patients nor in severe CAP.
TI  - Characterization of a 3944 Da bacteriocin, produced by Enterococcus mundtii ST15, with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain ST15, isolated from soy beans, and identified as Enterococcus mundtii, produces a 3944 Da bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of Lactobacillus sakei, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Acinetobacter baumanii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus caprinus. Bacteriocin ST15 is inactivated by proteinase K, pronase, pepsin, protease and Triton X-114, but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, Triton X-100, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea and EDTA. No change in activity was recorded after 2 h at pH values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100 degrees C for 90 min. Activity was, however, lost after treatment at 121 degrees C for 20 min. The mode of activity is bactericidal. The highest level of activity (51200 AU ml(-1)) was recorded when cells were grown in MRS broth, pH 6.5. Bacteriocin ST15 differs from other broad-spectrum bacteriocins described for Enterococcus spp. by being active against Gram-negative bacteria and by being smaller.
TI  - Phenatic acids A and B, new potentiators of antifungal miconazole activity produced by Streptomyces sp. K03-0132.
AB  - Two new phenols, designated phenatic acids A and B, were isolated along with known actiphenol, from the culture of Streptomyces sp. K03-0132 by solvent extraction, silica gel column chromatography and HPLC. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analyses including mainly various NMR experiments. They have a common 1-hydroxy 2, 4-dimethyl benzene ring. These compounds potentiate miconazole activity against Candida albicans. Phenatic acid B also showed moderate antimicrobial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis and Acholeplasma laidlawii.
TI  - Pollution status of swimming pools in south-south zone of south-eastern Nigeria using microbiological and physicochemical indices.
AB  - Microbiological and physicochemical characteristics of swimming pools in South Eastern states of Nigeria (Akwa Ibom and Cross River) were investigated. The bacterial isolates included Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. Others were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus epidermidis, while fungal isolates were Penicillium sp, Rhizopus sp, Aspergillus versicolor Fusarium sp, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Mucor sp, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Absidia sp. The total viable count of microorganims in Ibeno (B) and Uyo (E) swimming pools were 6 x 10(6) cfu/ml and for Calabar (H) swimming pool, 3.3 x 10(7) cfu/ml. The total coliform counts were 10(6) cfu/100 ml for Calabar (G) swimming pools and 2 x 10(7) cfu/100 ml for Calabar (H) swimming pools while the fungal count ranged from 5 x 10(6) cfu/ml to 3 x 10(7) cfu/ml. Physical and chemical parameters known to be hazardous to health were also identified. The presence of high levels of coliform and fecal coliform bacteria (E. coli) revelaed that the swimming pools have not met the World Health Organization (WHO) standard for recreational waters. The swimming pools constitute a serious public health hazard.
TI  - Characterization and antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin 217 produced by natural isolate Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei BGBUK2-16.
AB  - The strain Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei BGBUK2-16. which was isolated from traditionally homemade white-pickled cheese, produces bacteriocin 217 (Bac217; approximately 7 kDa). The onset of Bac217 biosynthesis was observed in the logarithmic phase of growth, and the production plateau was reached after 9 or 12 h of incubation at 37 and 30 degrees C, respectively, when culture entered the early stationary phase. Biochemical characterization showed that Bac217 retained antimicrobial activity within the range of pH 3 to 12 or after treatment at 100 degrees C for 15 min. Bac217 antimicrobial activity also remained unchanged after storage at 4 degrees C for 6 months or -20 degrees C for up to 12 months. However, Bac217 activity was completely lost after treatment with different proteolytic enzymes. BGBUK2-16 contains only one plasmid about 80 kb in size. Plasmid curing indicated that genes coding for Bac217 synthesis and immunity seem to be located on this plasmid. Bac217 exhibited antimicrobial activity against some pathogenic bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. Interestingly, Bac217 showed activity against Salmonella sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC27853. The inhibitory effect of BGBUK2-16 on the growth of S. aureus in mixed culture was observed. S. aureus treatment with Bac217 led to a considerable decrease (CFU/ml) within a short period of time. The mode of Bac217 action on S. aureus was identified as bactericidal. It should be noted that the strain BGBUK2-16 was shown to be resistant to bacteriocin nisin, which is otherwise widely used as a food additive for fermented dairy products.
TI  - New luffariellolide derivatives from the Indonesian sponge Acanthodendrilla sp.
AB  - Investigation of the Indonesian sponge Acanthodendrilla sp. afforded five new luffariellolide-related sesterterpenes, acantholides A-E (1-5), in addition to luffariellolide and its 25-O-methyl and 25-O-ethyl derivatives. All structures were unambiguously established by 1D and 2D NMR and MS spectroscopy. Acantholide D and E are derivatives comprising the 1-acetylcyclopentan-5-ol moiety, which are new variants of the C(14)-C(20) segment for this type of linear sesterterpenes. Luffariellolide and its 25-O-methyl congener as well as acantholide E (5) were cytotoxic against the mouse lymphoma L5187Y cell line. Acantholide B (2), luffariellolide, and its 25-O-methyl congener were active against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli, the yeast Candida albicans, and the plant pathogenic fungus Cladosporium herbarum.
TI  - [Microbiological quality of minimally processed vegetable salads].
AB  - The microbiological condition of minimally processed vegetable salads (7-days durability) purchased in the retail network of Szczecin has been assessed. The study included 14 kinds of salads manufactured by two producers. The total count of mesophilic aerobic bacteria and their spores, aid-forming bacteria (lactobacilli), titre of coliforms, occurrence of pathogenic bacteria and counts of moulds and yeast were determined. No pathogenic bacteria (Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Proteus) was detected in all salads. However contamination by saprophytic microorganisms was high in salads of both producers. Total count of mesophilic aerobic bacteria was higher than recommended level (> 10(5) cfu/g) in majority of salads. The high quantities of yeast (> 10(3) jtk/g) and lactobacilli (10(3)-10(5) fu/g) were also stated. The titre of coliforms was reduced (down to 0.01-0.0001 g). The count of moulds did not exceed 100 cfu/g in a most of samples. Moulds occurring in tested samples were represented mainly by Penicillium sp.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - Quinazolin-4-one derivatives from Streptomyces isolates.
AB  - From the ethyl acetate extract of the strain Streptomyces sp. isolate GW23/1540,  besides 16 known products, several 1H-quinazolin-4-one derivatives were isolated. (SR)-2-(1-Hydroxyethyl)-2-methyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-quinazolin-4-one (4) and (RR)-2-(1-hydroxyethyl)-2-methyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-quinazolin-4-one (5) are new natural products. 2-Methyl-3H-quinazolin-4-one (2) and 1H-quinazoline-2,4-dione (3) are known from other bacteria and plants, respectively. From another Streptomyces sp., GW2/577, 5-methyl-1H-quinazoline-2,4-dione (6) was isolated and the structure proven by comparison with the isomeric 7. The new natural products showed no activity against the microalgae Chlorella vulgaris, Chlorella sorokiniana, and Scenedesmus subspicatus, the fungus Mucor miehei, the yeast Candida albicans, and the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Streptomyces viridochromogenes.
TI  - [Organic extracts with antimicrobian activity from Penicillium sp. (Moniliales) isolated from the sponge Ircinia felix (Porifera: Demospongiae)].
AB  - This research expresses the potential of the bacterial activity present in the organic extracts obtained from Penicillium sp., isolated from the esponge Irciniafelix. This activity was evaluated through agar diffusion test and Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC). The susceptibility trials of organic fractions were carried out against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Bacillus cereus and B. subtilis. The use of the chromatographic techniques (CLV and TLC), permitted to obtain bioactive organic extracts of different polarities, of which only the EtOAc and MeOH fractions inhibited the growth of the bacteria used. Of the EtOAc fractionation, only fraction number 3 EtOAc/Hex presented greatest activity against the Gram-positive bacteria. Number 1 EtOAc/Hex fraction increased its activity against S. aureus (24 mm) and S. epidermidis (25 mm), which can be explained by the loss of possible antagonistic effect during the fractionation process. The CMI trials were carried out for the EtOAc number I subfraction against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, B. cereus and B. subtilis, wich was clinical interest, and shows the potential of this organic extract as antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Biochemical characterization of Bacillus subtilis type II isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase, and phylogenetic distribution of isoprenoid biosynthesis pathways.
AB  - An open reading frame (Acc. no. P50740) on the Bacillus subtilis chromosome extending from bp 184,997-186,043 with similarity to the idi-2 gene of Streptomyces sp. CL190 specifying type II isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase was expressed in a recombinant Escherichia coli strain. The recombinant protein with a subunit mass of 39 kDa was purified to apparent homogeneity by column chromatography. The protein was shown to catalyse the conversion of dimethylallyl diphosphate into isopentenyl diphosphate and vice versa at rates of 0.23 and 0.63 micromol.mg(-1).min(-1), respectively, as diagnosed by 1H spectroscopy. FMN and divalent cations are required for catalytic activity; the highest rates were found with Ca2+. NADPH is required under aerobic but not under anaerobic assay conditions. The enzyme is related to a widespread family of (S)-alpha-hydroxyacid oxidizing enzymes including flavocytochrome b2 and L-lactate dehydrogenase and was shown to catalyse the formation of [2,3-13C2]lactate from [2,3-13C2]pyruvate, albeit at a low rate of 1 nmol.mg(-1).min(-1). Putative genes specifying type II isopentenyl diphosphate isomerases were found in the genomes of Archaea and of certain eubacteria but not in the genomes of fungi, animals and plants. The analysis of the occurrence of idi-1 and idi-2 genes in conjunction with the mevalonate and nonmevalonate pathway in 283 completed and unfinished prokaryotic genomes revealed 10 different classes. Type II isomerase is essential in some important human pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis where it may represent a novel target for anti-infective therapy.
TI  - Heterologous gene expression in Thermus thermophilus: beta-galactosidase, dibenzothiophene monooxygenase, PNB carboxy esterase, 2-aminobiphenyl-2,3-diol dioxygenase, and chloramphenicol acetyl transferase.
AB  - Enzymes from thermophiles are preferred for industrial applications because they  generally show improved tolerance to temperature, pressure, solvents, and pH as compared with enzymes from mesophiles. However, nearly all thermostable enzymes used in industrial applications or available commercially are produced as recombinant enzymes in mesophiles, typically Escherichia coli. The development of high-temperature bioprocesses, particularly those involving cofactor-requiring enzymes and/or multi-step enzymatic pathways, requires a thermophilic host. The extreme thermophile most amenable to genetic manipulation is Thermus thermophilus, but the study of expression of heterologous genes in T. thermophilus is in its infancy. While several heterologous genes have previously been expressed in T. thermophilus, the data reported here include the first examples of the functional expression of a gene from an archaeal hyperthermophile ( bglA from Pyrococcus woesei), a cofactor-requiring enzyme ( dszC from Rhodococcus erythropolis IGTS8), and a two-component enzyme ( carBa and carBb from Sphingomonas sp. GTIN11). A thermostable derivative of pnbA from Bacillus subtilis was also expressed, further expanding the list of genes from heterologous hosts that have been expressed in T. thermophilus.
TI  - The antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito Aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of Gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  - Previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against Gram- Escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against Gram+ Micrococcus sp., is melanization. We examined the immune responses mounted by Aedes aegypti towards Gram- Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium, and Gram+ Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial Gram type and pathogenicity. These data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to the immune response against prokaryotes.
TI  - Rugulotrosins A and B: Two new antibacterial metabolites from an Australian isolate of a Penicillium sp.
AB  - Two new antibacterial agents, rugulotrosin A (1) and B (2), were obtained from cultures of a Penicillium sp. isolated from soil samples acquired near Sussex Inlet, New South Wales, Australia. Rugulotrosin A (1) is a chiral symmetric dimer, and its relative stereostructure was determined by spectroscopic and X-ray crystallographic analysis. Rugulotrosin B (2) is a chiral asymmetric dimer isomeric with 1. Its structure was determined by spectroscopic analysis with comparison to the co-metabolite 1 and previously reported fungal metabolites. Both rugulotrosins A and B displayed significant antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, while rugulotrosin A was also strongly active against Enterococcus faecalis and B. cereus.
TI  - New sesterterpenes from the Antarctic sponge Suberites sp.
AB  - Suberitenones C and D and suberiphenol, three new sesterterpenes of the suberitane class, were isolated from the sponge Suberites sp. collected from Antarctica. The structures of these compounds were determined on the basis of combined spectral and chemical analyses.
TI  - A global approach to identify novel broad-spectrum antibacterial targets among proteins of unknown function.
AB  - Attempted allelic replacement of 144 Streptococcus pneumoniae open reading frames of previously uncharacterized function led to the identification of 36 genes essential for growth under laboratory conditions. Of these, 14 genes (obg, spoIIIJ2, trmU, yacA, yacM, ydiC, ydiE, yjbN, yneS, yphC, ysxC, ytaG, yloI and yxeH4) were also essential in Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae or Escherichia coli, 2 genes (yrrK and ydiB) were only essential in H. influenzae as well as S. pneumoniae and 8 genes were necessary for growth of S.pneumoniae and S. aureus and did not have a homolog in H. influenzae(murD2, ykqC, ylqF, yqeH, ytgP, yybQ) or were not essential in that organism (yqeL, yhcT). The proteins encoded by these genes could represent good targets for novel antibiotics covering different therapeutic profiles. The putative functions of some of these essential proteins, inferred by bioinformatic analysis, are presented. Four mutants, with deletions of loci not essential for in vitro growth, were found to be severely attenuated in a murine respiratory tract infection model, suggesting that not all targets for antibacterial therapeutics are revealed by simple in vitro essentiality testing. The results of our experiments together with those collated from previously reported studies including Bacillus subtilis, E. coli and Mycoplasma sp. demonstrate that gene conservation amongst bacteria does not necessarily indicate that essentiality in one organism can be extrapolated to others. Moreover, this study demonstrates that different experimental procedures can produce apparently contradictory results.
TI  - New nitrogenous Germacranes from a Thai marine sponge, Axinyssa n. sp.
AB  - Two new germacrane sesquiterpenes, including (1Z,4Z)-7alphaH-11-aminogermacra-1(10),4-diene (1) and N,N'-11-bis[(1Z,4Z)-7alphaH-germacra-1(10),4-dienyl]urea (2), were isolated from a Thai marine sponge Axinyssan. sp. collected from the Andaman Sea. The structure elucidations of 1 and 2 were accomplished by means of 1D and 2D NMR, MS, and IR spectroscopy. Only 1 exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Candida albicans.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal activity of Syzygium jambolanum seeds.
AB  - The water and methanolic extracts of Syzygium jambolanum seeds were examined for  antibacterial and antifungal activity in vitro using the disc diffusion method, minimum inhibitory concentration, minimum bactericidal concentration and minimum fungicidal concentration. Activity against gram positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus), gram negative bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli) and fungal strains (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, Rhizopus sp., Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Microsporum gypseum) is discussed.
TI  - Interactions between penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) and two novel classes of  PBP inhibitors, arylalkylidene rhodanines and arylalkylidene iminothiazolidin-4-ones.
AB  - Several non-beta-lactam compounds were active against various gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. The MICs of arylalkylidene rhodanines and arylalkylidene iminothiazolidin-4-ones were lower than those of ampicillin and cefotaxime for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus MI339 and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium EF12. Several compounds were found to inhibit the cell wall synthesis of S. aureus and the last two steps of peptidoglycan biosynthesis catalyzed by ether-treated cells of Escherichia coli or cell wall membrane preparations of Bacillus megaterium. The effects of the arylalkylidene rhodanines and arylalkylidene iminothiazolidin-4-one derivatives on E. coli PBP 3 and PBP 5, Streptococcus pneumoniae PBP 2xS (PBP 2x from a penicillin-sensitive strain) and PBP 2xR (PBP 2x from a penicillin-resistant strain), low-affinity PBP 2a of S. aureus, and the Actinomadura sp. strain R39 and Streptomyces sp. strain R61 DD-peptidases were studied. Some of the compounds exhibited inhibitory activities in the 10 to 100 microM concentration range. The inhibition of PBP 2xS by several of them appeared to be noncompetitive. The dissociation constant for the best inhibitor (Ki = 10 microM) was not influenced by the presence of the substrate.
TI  - [Microbiological quality of muesli samples purchased in retail network].
AB  - The estimation of microbiological quality of muesli samples was the aim of this investigation. The study included 40 samples which represented various consignments of muesli, produced in 2002 year. Total number of aerobic mesophilic bacteria, yeasts and moulds, and also occurrence of pathogenic bacteria, coliforms and enterococci were determined. The systematic units of muesli fungal flora have been identified. It was stated that microbiological quality of all tested muesli was good. No pathogenic bacteria (Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus) was detected and also coliforms and enterococci titre was correct (> 0.1 g). A majority of samples characterized low contamination levels of mesophilic aerobic bacteria and fungi, and their total number did not exceed, suitably 10(3) and 10(2) cfu/g. The mesophilic aerobic bacteria were mainly represented by vegetative forms. The average share of these bacteria spores in total number of bacteria received 30%. The Aspergillus sp. and Penicillium sp. were regular elements of muesli fungal flora.
TI  - Reconfirmation of antimicrobial activity in the coelomic fluid of the earthworm Eisenia fetida andrei by colorimetric assay.
AB  - A novel tetrazolium salt, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulphophenyl)-2H-tet razolium (MTS) was used in the assessment of antimicrobial activity in earthworm in the presence of phenazine methosulphate (PMS) as an electron coupling reagent. This activity was purified from the coelomic fluid of the earthworm (ECF), Eisenia fetida andrei (Oligochaeta, Lumbricidae, annelids) using a series of column chromatography techniques and was tested against three Gram-negative strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila and three Gram-positive strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus megaterium, Arthrobacter sp., respectively. Only the pigment-free eluate of coelomic fluid of the earthworm (ECFPE) showed activity against B. megaterium amongst three isolated active fractions. The anion (DEAE-52) exchange effluent of the ECFPE was reported to have the strongest activity against P. aeruginosa amongst the three active fractions. The 20% acetonitrile eluate (AE) by Sep-Pak C18 cartridge was also tested and showed fair resistance against E. coli, P. aeruginosa and Arthrobacter sp., respectively.
TI  - Evaluation of preservative systems in a sunscreen formula by linear regression method.
AB  - A sunscreen formula with eight different preservative systems was evaluated by linear regression, pharmacopeial, and the CTFA (Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association) methods. The preparations were tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Burkholderia cepacia, Shewanella putrefaciens, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus sp. The linear regression method proved to be useful in the selection of the most effective preservative system used in cosmetic formulation.
TI  - Eudistomins W and X, two new beta-carbolines from the micronesian tunicate Eudistoma sp.
AB  - Chemical investigation of the Micronesian ascidian Eudistoma sp. afforded two new eudistomin congeners, which were designated eudistomins W (1) and X (2). The structures of the new compounds were unambiguously established on the basis of NMR spectroscopic ((1)H, (13)C, COSY, (1)H detected direct, and long-range (13)C-(1)H correlations) and mass spectrometric (EI and ESIMS) data. Compound 2 exhibited antibiotic activity toward Bacillus subtilis, Staphyloccocus aureus, and Escherichia coli and was also found to be fungicidal against Candida albicans in an agar diffusion assay. Compound 1 was selectively active against C. albicans but showed no antibacterial activity.
TI  - Effects of ozone treatment on cell growth and ultrastructural changes in bacteria.
AB  - Ozone appeared to inhibit growth and caused the death of gram negative and gram positive tested bacteria: Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis. Bacterial cultures at 10(3), 10(4), 10(5), 10(6), and 10(7) cfu/ml dilution were exposed to 0.167/mg/min/L of ozone at different time intervals (0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 min). Cell viability was observed in all types of tested bacteria at 10(3), 10(4), 10(3) cfu/ml within 30 min after ozone exposure. However, cell inactivation was not significantly observed at concentrations of 10(6), 10(7) cfu/ml even after an exposure of 150 min. Ultrastructural changes of treated bacteria showed deformation, rough damage and surface destruction revealed by scanning electron microscopy. Some bacterial cells showed collapsed and shrunken patterns within 60 min and severe rupture and cellular lysis after 90 min of ozone treatment. This study supports the proposed mechanism of the bacteria inactivation by ozone that caused cell membrane destruction and finally lysis reaction. Thus, the precaution of using ozone as a biocide should be used to address appropriate concentrations of bacterial contamination in water.
TI  - Meroterpenes from Penicillium sp found in association with Melia azedarach.
AB  - A Penicillium sp was isolated from the root bark of Melia azedarach and cultivated over sterilized rice. After chromatographic procedures, two meroterpenes, named preaustinoid A and B, were obtained in addition to the known alkaloid verruculogen. Their structures were identified by extensive spectroscopic studies, and they exhibited moderate bacteriostatic effects on Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus sp.
TI  - Limnazine, the first bacterial azine derivative from Bacillus sp. GW90a.
AB  - A novel dimeric azine derivative designated as limnazine (1) has been isolated from the culture broth of an aquatic Bacillus sp. strain GW90a. The structure has been elucidated, on the basis of spectral data, as N,N'-bis(2,2,6-trimethylchroman-4-ylidene)azine and was additionally confirmed by synthesis. Limnazine (1) is inactive against algae, fungi, and bacteria.
TI  - Pharacine, a natural p-cyclophane and other indole derivatives from Cytophaga sp. strain AM13.1.
AB  - From the ethyl acetate extract of the bacterial strain Cytophaga sp. AM13.1, among many known compounds, the new natural products 2,5-bis(3-indolylmethyl)pyrazine (2) and a highly symmetrical p-cyclophane named pharacine (5) were identified. In addition, tryptamine isovalerate (1) and p-hydroxyphenylacetamide (4), known as plant metabolites, were isolated and characterized from a microorganism for the first time. The new natural products showed no activity against three microalgae, the fungus Mucor miehei, the yeast Candida albicans, and the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillussubtilis, Escherichia coli, and Streptomyces viridochromogenes.
TI  - Screening of eight alkaloids and ten flavonoids isolated from four species of the genus Boronia (Rutaceae) for antimicrobial activities against seventeen clinical microbial strains.
AB  - Eight alkaloids and ten flavonoids isolated from four species of Boronia of the Rutaceae were screened against 17 clinical microbial strains. Of the test compounds, three acridone and one quinolone alkaloids and eight flavonoids were reported as novel natural products. Screening was carried out by the standard disc diffusion method. Of the tested compounds, six alkaloids and seven flavonoids including the novel products were active against six clinical strains. The active compounds showed mild to moderate activities against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Sarcina lutea, exterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi and Klebsiella sp. Of the active flavonoids, some exhibited fairly significant activity towards Staphylococcus aureus, Sarcina lutea, Salmonella typhi and Klebsiella sp. The flavonoids were observed to have higher spectrum and magnitude of activity than those of the alkaloids. A standard ampicillin disc was used to compare the results.
TI  - New estimation methods of bacterial concentration by measuring ATP changes during incubation.
AB  - New estimation methods of bacterial cell concentration in samples by measurement  of the increase in bacterial adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) content during incubation using a conventional firefly luminometer were established. When an Escherichia coli cell suspension was incubated in nutrient broth, the increase in the ATP content of the suspension during the incubation period followed a sigmoidal curve. The increase ratio of the ATP content of the suspension at a given period of incubation (5 hours in this study) to the initial ATP content was greater at higher initial cell concentrations. With this relationship, the initial cell concentration of a test suspension could be predicted from the measured ratio; this was called the end point method. On the other hand, the lag period in the ATP increase curve was longer at lower initial cell concentrations. A highly linear relationship was observed between the lag period and the logarithm of the initial cell concentrations. Based on this relationship, a delay method was developed for prediction. The two relationships were also observed for bacterial suspensions of Klebsiella sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Pseudomonas sp. These results suggested that the two methods have the potential to estimate the bacterial cell concentration of a sample suspension.
TI  - Chemical constituents and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Lantana  xenica.
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the chemical composition of Lantana xenica essential oil and its antimicrobial activity. The oil from the aerial parts of Lantana xenica Mold. (Verbenacea) was obtained by steam distillation and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The major constituent of the oil was (E)-caryophyllene (35.2 %), with minor amounts of gamma-cadinene (13.3 %), alpha-pinene (9.3 %), ocimene (9.2 %) and germacrene D (6.6 %). The antimicrobial assays showed that the essential oil of L. xenica inhibited the growth of Bacillus cereus and Proteus mirabilis and both bacteria were inhibited by (E)-caryophyllene, the major component of the oil. Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus showed a lower inhibition. The bacteria Micrococcus luteus, Klebsiella sp., Escherichia coli and the yeast Candida albicans were insensitive to both the oil and (E)-caryophyllene.
TI  - Munumbicins, wide-spectrum antibiotics produced by Streptomyces NRRL 30562, endophytic on Kennedia nigriscans.
AB  - Munumbicins A, B, C and D are newly described antibiotics with a wide spectrum of activity against many human as well as plant pathogenic fungi and bacteria, and a Plasmodium sp. These compounds were obtained from Streptomyces NRRL 3052, which is endophytic in the medicinal plant snakevine (Kennedia nigriscans), native to the Northern Territory of Australia. This endophyte was cultured, the broth was extracted with an organic solvent and the contents of the residue were purified by bioassay-guided HPLC. The major components were four functionalized peptides with masses of 1269.6, 1298.5, 1312.5 and 1326.5 Da. Numerous other related compounds possessing bioactivity, with differing masses, were also present in the culture broth extract in lower quantities. With few exceptions, the peptide portion of each component contained only the common amino acids threonine, aspartic acid (or asparagine), glutamic acid (or glutamine), valine and proline, in varying ratios. The munumbicins possessed widely differing biological activities depending upon the target organism. For instance, munumbicin B had an MIC of 2.5 microg x ml(-1) against a methicillin-resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus, whereas munumbicin A was not active against this organism. In general, the munumbicins demonstrated activity against Gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus anthracis and multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, the most impressive biological activity of any of the munumbicins was that of munumbicin D against the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum, having an IC(50) of 4.5+/-0.07 ng x ml(-1). This report also describes the potential of the munumbicins in medicine and agriculture.
TI  - Genetic characterization of the fusidic acid and cadmium resistance determinants  of Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pUB101.
AB  - We report the cloning of the fusidic acid and cadmium resistance determinants from Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pUB101. The pUB101 fusidic acid resistance determinant was located on a 2.9 kb HindIII fragment. Sequencing of this fragment revealed three putative open reading frames (ORFs) of 213 (far1), 152 (orf152) and 170 amino acids (orf170), which are flanked by the right-hand end of insertion sequence IS431/257 (IS431/257RH) and a partial ORF. Far1 and Orf152 demonstrated homology with a chromosomally encoded fibronectin-binding protein of Listeria monocytogenes and the putative protein YosT, found on the SP beta c2 prophage of Bacillus subtilis, respectively. Transformation of S. aureus with a construct containing a 949 bp far1-specific amplicon led to the isolation of a fusidic acid-resistant transformant, thereby identifying the pUB101 fusidic acid resistance structural gene. Between orf152 and far1 we identified a unique 113 bp symmetrical element and other repeat elements that may be involved with the control of orf152 and/or far1 expression. Hybridization of Southern blots revealed that far1 was not located on the chromosome or plasmid content of a limited number of Australian, UK and Hong Kong fusidic acid-resistant isolates. The pUB101 cadmium resistance determinant was located on a 3.6 kb HindIII fragment that carried a cadDX operon, remnants of two putative plasmid replication protein genes and IS431/257RH. Sequence analysis also demonstrated the presence of a single-stranded origin of replication, normally found on rolling circle replicating plasmids, within the putative promoter region of the cadDX operon.
TI  - The activity of p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus ducreyi, and other microorganisms.
AB  - p-Methoxybenzylisothiocyanate was isolated from Lepidium bonariense and found to  be responsible for the plants antimicrobial and STD activity. MIC determinations were conducted for p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate on Haemophilus ducreyi, Neisseria gonorrheae, Candida albicans, Bacillus subtilus, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Psuedomanas aeruginosa. An in vitro cellular toxicity assay showed that at 100 microM (17,9 microg/mL) p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate is not toxic to living cells.
TI  - Biologically active polyketide metabolites from an undetermined fungicolous hyphomycete resembling Cladosporium.
AB  - Eight new polyketide-derived metabolites [cladoacetals A and B (1 and 2), 3-(2-formyl-3-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid (3), 3-deoxyisoochracinic acid (4), isoochracinol (5), 7-hydroxy-3-(2,3-dihydroxybutyl)-1(3H)-isobenzofuranone (6), (+)-cyclosordariolone (10), and altersolanol J (11)] and six known metabolites [two isomeric 1-(1,3-dihydro-4-hydroxy-1-isobenzofuranyl)butan-2,3-diols (7a/b), 7-hydroxy-1(3H)-isobenzofuranone (8), isoochracinic acid (9), altersolanol A (12), and macrosporin (13)] have been isolated from solid-substrate fermentation cultures of an undetermined fungicolous isolate (NRRL 29097) that resembles Cladosporium sp. All structures were assigned primarily by analysis of 1D and/or 2D NMR data. Five of the compounds showed antibacterial activity.
TI  - Antifungal garcinia acid esters from the fruits of Garcinia atroviridis.
AB  - Two new garcinia acid derivatives, 2-(butoxycarbonylmethyl)-3-butoxycarbonyl-2-hydroxy-3-propanolide and 1',1"-dibutyl methyl hydroxycitrate, were isolated from the fruits of Garcinia atroviridis guided by TLC bioautography against the fungus Cladosporium herbarum. The structures of these compounds were established by spectral analysis. The former compound represents a unique beta-lactone structure and the latter compound is most likely an artefact of garcinia acid (= hydroxycitric acid). Both compounds showed selective antifungal activity comparable to that of cycloheximide (MID: 0.5 microg/spot) only against C herbarum at the MIDs of 0.4 and 0.8 microg/spot but were inactive against bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli), other fungi (Alternaria sp., Fusarium moniliforme and Aspergillus ochraceous) including the yeast Candida albicans.
TI  - CAY-I, a fungicidal saponin from Capsicum sp. fruit.
AB  - Saponins are steroidal or terpenoid-based glycosides with surface active properties. A steroidal saponin, CAY-1, with a molecular weight of 1243.35 Da, was isolated and purified to homogeneity from commercially available dry, ground fruit of Capsicum frutescens. CAY-1 was shown to be a potent fungicide for the germinating conidia of Aspergillus flavus, A. fumigatus, A. parasiticus and A. niger with species-dependent LD90 values between 3 and 20 microM. Activity against some Aspergillus species was affected by the test medium used. In vitro assays, CAY-1 was effective against Pneumocystis carinii (IC50): 9.5 microM) and Candida albicans (IC90: 6.2 microM). CAY-1 had no effect on the viability of the nongerminating conidia of the two filamentous fungi, P. carinii and C. albicans, nor on the conidial type of Fusarium oxysporum. It was ineffective against the bacteria Enterobacter agglomerans, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. CAY-1 was not cytotoxic to A 549 lung carcinoma cells or HeLa cells at effective fungicidal concentrations. The results indicate that CAY-1 is an effective fungicide for Aspergillus species, C. albicans and P. carinii at concentrations below the threshold for mammalian cell toxicity.
TI  - Multibranched polyunsaturated and very-long-chain fatty acids of freshwater Israeli sponges.
AB  - Very-long-chain and multibranched polyunsaturated fatty acids of three freshwater sponges, Ephydatia syriaca, Nudospongilla sp., and Cortispongilla barroisi, were studied by silver TLC, GC-MS, UV, IR, HRMS, and NMR methods. One hundred and eighty-five conventional fatty acids were identified by GC-MS, out of which five were new multibranched polyunsaturated fatty acids. The freshwater sponges belonging to the family Spongillidae (class Demospongia) were shown to contain novel di-, tri-, and tetramethyl substituted dienoic, tetraenoic, and hexaenoic fatty acids. The compounds gave positive results in a brine shrimp toxicity assay.
TI  - Stethoscope: a friend or an enemy?
AB  - CONTEXT: The stethoscope is a universal tool in the hospital that is in direct contact with many patients and can therefore be a vector in the dissemination of bacterial infections. OBJECTIVE: To research the presence of bacteria, fungi and yeast on the stethoscope diaphragm and the resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial drugs. DESIGN: Descriptive, prospective, non-controlled. SETTING: A tertiary care hospital. SAMPLE: Samples were taken randomly from 300 stethoscopes employed by medical staff (medical residents, medical students, nurses and nursing school students) and other sectors of the hospital. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: Three hundred stethoscope diaphragms used in several sectors of the hospital facilities by medical doctors (63 samples), medical residents (54 samples), medical students (106 samples), nursing school students (33 samples) and specific sectors (36 samples) were analyzed. Material was collected randomly. It was collected with the aid of a sterile swab moistened in physiological solution, inoculated into Brain Heart Infusion media and incubated in an oven for 24 to 48 hours. After this period, the samples were inoculated into blood agar, MacConkey agar and Sabouraud media and identified by Gram staining and biochemical assays. An assay to test bacteria sensitivity to antibiotics was also carried out by the Kirby-Bauer method. RESULTS: Eighty-seven percent of the analyzed stethoscopes were contaminated. Gram-positive cocci, yeasts, fungi and Gram-positive and negative bacilli were isolated. There was no significant association between the most predominant microorganisms and professional category. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus negative coagulase and Bacillus were significantly more frequent in relation to the presence of more than one microorganism on the stethoscope diaphragm. CONCLUSION: Stethoscopes presented a high rate of contamination and their use without precautions can spread nosocomial infections.
TI  - Pibocin B, the first N-O-methylindole marine alkaloid, a metabolite from the Far-Eastern ascidian Eudistoma species.
AB  - Pibocin B (2), the first representative of marine alkaloids with a unique structural feature, an N-O-methylindole group, was isolated from the Far-Eastern ascidian Eudistoma sp. Its structure has been established as (8 beta)-2-bromo-N-O-methyl-6,8-dimethylergoline on the basis of NMR data, FAB and MALDI-TOF MS, and chemical correlations. Pibocin B showed moderate cytotoxic activity against mouse Ehrlich carcinoma cells.
TI  - Molecular cloning and expression of Mn(2+)-dependent sphingomyelinase/hemolysin of an aquatic bacterium, Pseudomonas sp. strain TK4.
AB  - We report here the molecular cloning and expression of a hemolytic sphingomyelinase from an aquatic bacterium, Pseudomonas sp. strain TK4. The sphingomyelinase gene was found to consist of 1,548 nucleotides encoding 516 amino acid residues. The recombinant 57.7-kDa enzyme hydrolyzed sphingomyelin but not phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, or phosphatidylethanolamine, indicating that the enzyme is a sphingomyelin-specific sphingomyelinase C. The hydrolysis of sphingomyelin by the enzyme was found to be most efficient at pH 8.0 and activated by Mn(2+). The enzyme shows quite a broad specificity, i.e., it hydrolyzed 4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD)-sphingomyelin with short-chain fatty acids and NBD-sphingosylphosphorylcholine, the latter being completely resistant to hydrolysis by any sphingomyelinase reported so far. Significant sequence similarities were found in sphingomyelinases from Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria ivanovii, and Leptospira interrogans, as well as a hypothetical protein encoded in Chromobacterium violaceum, although the first three lacked one-third of the sequence corresponding to that from the C terminus of the TK4 enzyme. Interestingly, the deletion mutant of strain TK4 lacking 186 amino acids at the C-terminal end hydrolyzed sphingomyelin, whereas it lost all hemolytic activity, indicating that the C-terminal region of the TK4 enzyme is indispensable for the hemolytic activity.
TI  - Evaluation of extracts of the root of Landolphia owerrience for antibacterial activity.
AB  - Ethanolic and aqueous (cold and hot) extracts of Landolphia owerrience root parts (whole-root, root-bark and root-wood) were tested for activity against ten bacterial strains using agar-well diffusion and macro-broth dilution methods, respectively. The ethanolic extracts of the whole-root and root-wood were active against 100 and 80% of the test organisms, respectively. Ethanolic and aqueous extracts of the root-bark were moderately active while the aqueous (cold and hot) extracts of the root-wood exhibited little or no activity. Out of the nine extracts prepared, 66.7% were active against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600, 55.6% variously against each of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145 and local clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi, 44.4% against Proteus sp., 33.3% against Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6051 and 22.2% against E. coli ATCC 11775. The agar-well-determined MIC values for the ethanolic whole-root extract (0.78-50 mg/ml) were higher (indicating lower activity) than the corresponding macro-broth-determined values (0.39-50 mg/ml) probably because of slow diffusion rates of the active constituents of the extract in agar. On the other hand, the differences could be due to the effects of DMSO used to dissolve the ethanolic extracts in the agar-well diffusion tests. Similar discrepancies in the MIC values detectable with the two test methods were apparent in the root-wood extract and the control drug, Gentamycin, except that in the latter the agar-well-determined MIC values (0.125-8.0 microg/ml) were lower than the macro-broth-determined values (0.125-64 microg/ml). The strong activity of the ethanolic extracts against known etiologic agents of diseases traditionally treated with L. owerrience root of similar preparations provides scientific justification for the use of the herb in ethnomedical practice in Nigeria.
TI  - Characteristics of surfactant protein A and D binding to lipoteichoic acid and peptidoglycan, 2 major cell wall components of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Infection with gram-positive bacteria is a major cause of pneumonia. Surfactant proteins A (SP-A) and D (SP-D) are thought to play an important role in the innate immunity of the lung. Both proteins can bind to gram-positive bacteria. Until now, it was not known with which surface component(s) of gram-positive bacteria SP-A and SP-D interact. Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and peptidoglycan (PepG) are components of the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria. By use of a solid phase-based binding assay, LTA of Bacillus subtilis was shown to be bound by SP-D but not by SP-A. Unmodified PepG of Staphylococcus aureus was bound by SP-D. SP-D binding to both LTA and PepG was calcium dependent and carbohydrate inhibitable. These results indicate that SP-D interacts with gram-positive bacteria via binding to the cell wall components LTA and PepG and that the carbohydrate recognition domain is responsible for this binding.
TI  - Cedarmycins A and B, new antimicrobial antibiotics from Streptomyces sp. TP-A0456.
AB  - Two novel butyrolactone antibiotics, cedarmycins A and B, were isolated from the  cultured broth of the actinomycete Streptomyces sp. TP-A0456. The new compounds were purified by HP-20 resin, silica gel, ODS column chromatographies and preparative HPLC, consecutively. The structure of cedarmycin was determined by spectroscopic methods as an alpha,beta-unsaturated butyrolactone with a fatty acid side chain. These compounds showed antibiotic activity against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria and yeasts. Among the tested organisms, cedarmycins potently inhibited the growth of Candida glabrata IFO 0622 with the MIC of 0.4 microg/ml, comparable to that of amphotericin B.
TI  - Class II broad-spectrum mercury resistance transposons in Gram-positive bacteria  from natural environments.
AB  - We have studied the mechanisms of the horizontal dissemination of a broad-spectrum mercury resistance determinant among Bacillus and related species. This mer determinant was first described in Bacillus cereus RC607 from Boston Harbor, USA, and was then found in various Bacillus and related species in Japan, Russia and England. We have shown that the mer determinant can either be located at the chromosome, or on a plasmid in the Bacillus species, and is carried by class II mercury resistance transposons: Tn5084 from B. cereus RC607 and B. cereus VKM684 (ATCC10702) and Tn5085 from Exiguobacterium sp. TC38-2b. Tn5085 is identical in nucleotide sequence to TnMERI1, the only other known mer transposon from Bacillus species, but it does not contain an intron like TnMERI1. Tn5085 is functionally active in Escherichia coli. Tn5083, which we have isolated from B. megaterium MK64-1, contains an RC607-like mer determinant, that has lost some mercury resistance genes and possesses a merA gene which is a novel sequence variant that has not been previously described. Tn5083 and Tn5084 are recombinants, and are comprised of fragments from several transposons including Tn5085, and a relative of a putative transposon from B. firmus (which contains similar genes to the cadmium resistance operon of Staphylococcus aureus), as well as others. The sequence data showed evidence for recombination both between transposition genes and between mer determinants.
TI  - Bogorol A produced in culture by a marine Bacillus sp. reveals a novel template for cationic peptide antibiotics.
AB  - [figure: see text] Bogorol A (1), a novel peptide antibiotic active against MRSA  and VRE, has been isolated from cultures of a marine Bacillus sp. collected in Papua New Guinea. The structure of bogorol A was elucidated by a combination of spectroscopic analyses and chemical degradation. Bogorol A illustrates a new structural template for "cationic peptide antibiotics".
TI  - 16S rDNA-based identification of bacteria from conjunctival swabs by PCR and DGGE fingerprinting.
AB  - PURPOSE: Establishment of a new molecular biology technique for the identification of multiple bacteria from the ocular environment, which can be applied supplementarily to cultivation in cases of severe bacterial infections. METHODS: From 60 human conjunctivae (29 with purulent and 31 with nonpurulent conjunctivitis), swabs were taken and DNA was extracted. Fragments of 200 bp, spanning the V3 region of the eubacterial 16S rDNA, were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). For phylogenetic identification, DGGE bands were excised and directly sequenced, or 16S rDNA clone libraries were constructed and clones were screened by DGGE. Sequences were compared with sequences of known bacteria listed in the EMBL database. Furthermore, the results were compared with results obtained from conventional cultivation. RESULTS: 16S rDNA could be amplified from 25 of 29 investigated swabs taken from purulent conjunctivitis eyes and from 2 of 31 investigated swabs taken from nonpurulent conjunctivitis eyes. Sixteen samples showed monomicrobial and 11 samples showed polymicrobial infections. The following genera (n is number of samples) were detected: Staphylococcus (n = 8), Corynebacterium (n = 7), Propionibacterium (n = 7), Streptococcus (n = 6), Bacillus (n = 2), Acinetobacter (n = 3), Pseudomonas (n = 3), Proteus (n = 1), and Brevundimonas (n = 1). Four sequences could not be identified to the genus level. They had highest sequence similarities both to sequences of Pantoea and Enterobacter (n = 1), Kingella and Neisseria (n = 1), Serratia and Aranicola (n = 1), and Leuconostoc and Weissella (n = 2), respectively. Culture was only positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9), Corynebacteria (n = 3), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), Streptococcus sp. (n = 1), Proteus sp. (n = 1), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1). In total, 45% of the 60 analyzed conjunctival swabs were PCR positive, whereas only 22% were culture positive. No sample positive by culture gave negative results by PCR. CONCLUSIONS: 16S rDNA sequence analyses and DGGE fingerprinting are appropriate methods for the detection and identification of monomicrobial as well as polymicrobial ocular infections of bacteria that might not be detected by conventional cultivation.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of human organ-cultured corneas.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to detect and identify bacterial contaminants  in human corneoscleral tissue after organ culture storage. METHODS: Seventy-two corneoscleral rims and corneal buttons trephined from organ cultured corneoscleral discs using aseptic technique and 45 organ-cultured donor corneoscleral rims postpenetrating keratoplasty) were subjected to a mechanical extraction technique using a Stomacher laboratory blender. As a control, 28 of the corneoscleral rims and buttons were halved; one half of each corneoscleral rim and button was decontaminated in formalin for 48 hours before thorough washing in balanced salt solution. Corneal specimens, culture medium, and transport (5% dextran) medium were cultured in brain-heart infusion broth at 37 degrees C for 5 days. Bacterial isolates were identified after culture of turbid enrichment broth. RESULTS: Bacterial contamination was demonstrated in 29% (21 of 72) of the corneoscleral rims and 15% (11 of 72) of the corneal buttons that were trephined aseptically from corneoscleral discs and in 29% (13 of 45) of postkeratoplasty corneoscleral rims. Bacterial contaminants were not isolated from controls. Isolated microorganisms included coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, Pseudomonas sp, and Bacillus sp. A correlation was not demonstrated between contamination and cause of death, death to enucleation, death to culture time, or time in culture. Postkeratoplasty endophthalmitis was not evident in the patients who had received corneal buttons from those corneoscleral discs that had contaminated corneoscleral rims. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial contamination exists in corneoscleral tissue after organ culture storage. The difference in distribution of bacteria and percentage of contamination between the peripheral and central corneas causes us to question the value of routine postpenetrating keratoplasty corneoscleral rim cultures.
TI  - rho is not essential for viability or virulence in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - We have identified the gene for transcription termination factor Rho in Staphylococcus aureus. Deletion of rho in S. aureus reveals that it is not essential for viability or virulence. We also searched the available bacterial genomic sequences for homologs of Rho and found that it is broadly distributed and highly conserved. Exceptions include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803, all of which appear not to possess a Rho homolog. Complementation studies indicate that S. aureus Rho possesses the same activity as Escherichia coli Rho and that the Rho inhibitor bicyclomycin is active against S. aureus Rho. Our results explain the lack of activity of bicyclomycin against many gram-positive bacteria and raise the possibility that the essentiality of rho may be the exception rather than the rule.
TI  - Bioactivity studies of extracts from Tridax procumbens.
AB  - An updated review on the biological activity of Tridax procumbens is presented. A detailed biological screening comprised of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, yeasts and fungi using crude extracts of this plant was undertaken. The n-hexane extract of the flowers showed activity against Escherichia coli. The same extract of the whole aerial parts was active against Mycobacterium smegmatis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella group C and Salmonella paratyphi. The ethyl-acetate extract of the flowers was active against Bacillus cereus and Klebsiella sp. The aerial parts extract also showed activity only against Mycobacterium smegmatis and Staphylococcus aureus, while the aqueous extract showed no antimicrobial activity. None of the tested extracts was active against the yeasts, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis and Rhodotorula rubra; or the fungi: Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Mucor sp. and Trichophyton rubrum.
TI  - Antimicrobial and phytochemical studies on 45 Indian medicinal plants against multi-drug resistant human pathogens.
AB  - Ethanolic extracts of 45 Indian medicinal plants traditionally used in medicine were studied for their antimicrobial activity against certain drug-resistant bacteria and a yeast Candida albicans of clinical origin. Of these, 40 plant extracts showed varied levels of antimicrobial activity against one or more test bacteria. Anticandidal activity was detected in 24 plant extracts. Overall, broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity was observed in 12 plants (L. inermis, Eucalyptus sp., H. antidysentrica, H. indicus, C. equistifolia. T. belerica, T. chebula, E. officinalis, C. sinensis, S. aromaticum and P. granatum). No correlation was observed between susceptibility of test strains with plant extracts and antibiotic resistance behaviour of the microbial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella paratyphi, Shigella dysenteriae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans). Qualitative phytochemical tests, thin layer chromatography and TLC-bioautography of certain active extracts demonstrated the presence of common phytocompounds in the plant extracts including phenols, tannins and flavonoids as major active constituents.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of new adamantane derivatives II.
AB  - A series of new derivatives of adamantane was synthesised. The new compound 4-(adamant-1-ylethylenoxycarbonyl)phthalanhydride obtained from 1-adamantaneethanol and trimellitic anhydride chloride, as well as 4-(adamant-1-ylmethylenoxycarbonyl)phthalanhydride, appeared very useful for preparation of a number of N-substituted phthalimides. Antimicrobial activity of newly obtained derivatives such as, for example, 4-(adamant-1-ylethylenoxycarbonyl)-N-(L-phenylalanyl)phthalimide or 4-(adamant-1-ylmethylenoxycarbonyl)-N-(L-leucyl)-phthalimide was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus sp., Micrococcus flavus and Enterococcus faecium. The minimal inhibitory concentrations for these compounds against Bacillus cereus were 15 and 8 microg/ml, respectively.
TI  - The Na+/H+ antiporter of alkaliphilic Bacillus sp.
AB  - The Na+/H+ antiporter, which appears to predominantly contribute to the alkaliphily of Bacillus halodurans C-125, was studied in an alkali-sensitive mutant of this strain and a transformant with restored alkaliphily. The alkali-sensitive mutant, strain 38154, which has lost the ability to grow above pH 9.5, was found to lack electrogenic Na+/H+ antiport activity driven by deltapsi (membrane potential, interior negative), and it showed defective regulation of intracellular pH under alkaline conditions. On the other hand, a transformant carrying a 2.0-kb DNA fragment from the parental genome that complemented this defect was able to maintain an intracellular pH lower than that of the external milieu, and it was found to have recovered the Na+/H+ antiport activity driven by deltapsi. Sequence analyses found that a 5.1-kb DNA region contained four open reading frames (ORF-1 to ORF-4). Direct sequencing of the corresponding region in mutant 38154 revealed a G-to-A substitution, which resulted in an amino acid substitution from Gly-393 to Arg in the putative ORF-1 product. It has been recently found that a region homologous to the DNA fragment responsible for the alkaliphily of strain C-125 exists in the genomes of Bacillus subtilis, Sinorhizobium (Rhizobium) meliloti, and Staphylococcus aureus. These homologues are present as a cluster of seven ORFs in each case. The shaA gene product of B. subtilis shows significant similarity to the ORF-1 product of strain C-125. Disruption of the shaA gene resulted in a decrease in Na+/H+ antiport activity, and growth of the shaA-disrupted strain was impaired when the external Na+ concentration was increased. We conclude that the shaA gene encodes a Na+/H+ antiporter, which plays an important role in extrusion of cytotoxic Na+.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of new adamantane derivatives I.
AB  - A series of fourteen derivatives of adamantane was synthesised. The new compound  4-(adamant-1-ylmethoxycarbonyl)phthalanhydride obtained from 1-adamantane-methanol and trimellitic anhydride chloride appeared very useful for preparation of a number of N-substituted phthalimides. Antimicrobial activity of the newly obtained derivatives such as, for example, 4-(adamant-1-ylmethoxycarbonyl)-N-(5-carboxypentamethylene)p hthalimide or 4-(adamant-1-ylmethoxycarbonyl)-N-(L-alanyl)phthalimide was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus sp., Micrococcus flavus and Enterococcus faecium. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for these compounds against S. aureus were 0.022 and 0.05 microg/ml, respectively.
TI  - New macrolactins from a marine Bacillus sp. Sc026.
AB  - Bioassay-guided fractionation of the EtOAc extract of a marine Bacillus sp. Sc026 culture broth has led to the isolation of the known compound, macrolactin F (1), together with two new compounds, 7-O-succinyl macrolactin F (2) and 7-O-succinyl macrolactin A (3). The chemical structures of 1-3 were elucidated on the basis of spectral data analyses and literature data comparison. Compounds 1-3 exhibited antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of toys in neonatal intensive care cots.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the bacteria and fungi contaminating toys in neonatal  intensive care unit (NICU) cots, the colonization rates, and factors that influence them. METHODS: A cross-sectional, longitudinal bacteriologic survey of all toys in the cots of infants in an NICU. All the toys in an infant's cot were cultured weekly for 4 weeks. Data were collected on the infant's postnatal age, the type of cot, whether humidity was added, characteristics of the toy, and any infant infections. RESULTS: Over the 4-week period, there were 86 cultures from 34 toys of 19 infants. Bacteria were grown from 84/86 (98%): 84 of the cultures grew coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, 50 Micrococcus sp, 21 Bacillus sp, 13 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 12 diphtheroids, 4 group B streptococcus, 3 S aureus, 3 nonhemolytic streptococci, 3 group D streptococci, 4 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, and 2 coliforms. None grew fungi. The colonization rate did not differ with cot type, presence of humidity, size of the toy, toy fiber length, or the fluffiness score. Eight (42%) of the infants had positive blood culture results and 5/8 of the isolates (63%) were of the same type as that colonizing their corresponding toy. IMPLICATIONS: With time, all the toys in NICU cots became colonized with bacteria. Many were potentially pathogenic. Toys may be reservoirs for potential infantile nosocomial sepsis. infant, newborn, toys, infection, neonatal intensive care.
TI  - Stresgenin B, an inhibitor of heat-induced heat shock protein gene expression, produced by Streptomyces sp. AS-9.
AB  - Stresgenin B was isolated as an inhibitor of heat-induced heat shock protein (HSP) gene expression from a culture broth of Streptomyces sp. AS-9 by silica gel chromatography and HPLC. The molecular formula of the novel compound was determined as C11H13NO5 by high resolution FAB-MS analysis, and the structure was determined by UV, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, HMQC, HMBC, and NOESY spectra. Stresgenin B inhibited heat-induced luciferase reporter-gene expression directed by the human hsp70B promoter in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells at concentrations lower than the concentrations for inhibition of dexamethasone-induced luciferase reporter-gene expression directed by the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-LTR promoter. The inhibition of heat-induced reporter gene expression was evident even when cells were exposed to stresgenin B only during heat stress treatment. Moreover, the compound inhibited heat-induced syntheses of hsp72/73, hsp90, and hsp110 and thereby suppressed the induction of thermotolerance. Stresgenin B showed moderate cytotoxic activities against several neoplastic cell lines and also showed antibacterial activities against Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus strains.
TI  - Bacterial interdigital scaly erythema (Kitamura): a possible new clinical entity.
AB  - Four patients with scaly erythema on their finger webs and sides of their fingers during summer are described. These patients were working in either butcher's shops or a sushi bar, where they handled raw meat, chicken or fish for many hours. The eruptions first appeared as scaly erythema, sometimes accompanied by small pustules, on the second, third and fourth finger webs, and later the erythema extended to the sides of the fingers and palms. Maceration and/or shallow erosion sometimes appeared on the finger webs. Symptoms were usually mild; the patients complained of slight itching, irritation or pain. Direct examination of specimens stained with Parker blue-black ink containing KOH revealed scales containing bacterial granules or filaments. Several species of bacteria were cultured including Corynebacterium sp. Fungus was not detected in either KOH specimens or in cultures. The lesions responded rapidly to topical or oral antibiotics; however, they recurred frequently during hot and humid weather. Hitherto a similar condition has not been described and is possibly a new clinical entity.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Orobanche cernua extract.
AB  - The effect of the parasitic plant Orobanche cernua extract was evaluated on 5 different Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Dilution experiments show that the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC; microgram/ml) of the extract was as follows: Staphylococcus aureus-1526.5; Streptococcus sp.-3125; Streptococcus pyogenes-25,000 and both for Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli-50,000 micrograms/ml. Data indicated that the MIC of 3125 micrograms/ml is equal to cefotaxime (30 micrograms) and tobromycin (10 micrograms) activity against Streptococcus sp. and S. aureus, respectively; 25,000 and 50,000 micrograms/ml is equal to cefotaxime (30 micrograms) activity against S. pyogenes and B. cereus, respectively, and 50,000 micrograms/ml is equal to nalidixic acid (30 micrograms) activity against E. coli. It can be concluded that the O. cernua extract displays remarkable activity against some Gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus and Staphylococcus.
TI  - Chemical composition and biological activity of extracts from arrabidaea bilabiata.
AB  - Consumption of Arrabidaea bilabiata fresh leaves produces a paraplegic syndrome in cattle. For isolation of the active principle, isopropanol and methanol extracts were prepared from the aerial parts of the plant; these were administered to Sprague-Dawley rats at doses of 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/kg, orally, to determine the presence of substances affecting spontaneous motor activity. The isopropanol extract produced significant increases of long-pause and short-pause movements (112 and 54%, respectively). The methanol extract tended to increase motor activity, but the effect did not reach statistical significance. Chemical and spectroscopic analysis of the isopropanol extract showed allantoin was the major constituent. It was administered to rats, at doses of 1.2, 12, and 120 mg/kg. A complex dose-response curve was observed, but at the highest dose, there was a 52% increase in the number of long-pause movements. It was inferred that allantoin and the constituents of the alcholic extracts might not be responsible for the paraplegic synndrome in cattle. The alteration of cattle motor activity could be caused by other non-alcoholic constituents. Additionally, extracts were assayed for in vitro activity against Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumonae , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Staphylococcus aureus , Bacillus sp. and Candida albicans . All microbial strains were found to be resistant to the extracts with the exception of C. albicans , suggesting a possible antifungal activity.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of tea as affected by the degree of fermentation and manufacturing season.
AB  - Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Salmonella sp. and Staphylococcus aureus were used to test the antimicrobial activity of tea flush extract and extracts of various tea products. Among the six test organisms, P. fluorescens was the most sensitive to the extracts, while B. subtilis was the least sensitive. In general, antimicrobial activity decreased when the extents of tea fermentation increased. The antimicrobial activities of tea flush extract and extracts of tea products with different extents of fermentation varied with test organisms. Tea flush and Green tea, the unfermented tea, exerted the strongest antimicrobial activity followed by the partially fermented tea products such as Longjing, Tieh-Kuan-Ying, Paochung, and Oolong teas. On the other hand, Black tea, the completely fermented tea, showed the least antimicrobial activity. It was also noted that extracts of Oolong tea prepared in summer exhibited the strongest antimicrobial activity, followed by those prepared in spring, winter and fall.
TI  - Inhibitory activity of Paenibacillus polymyxa SCE2 against human pathogenic micro-organisms.
AB  - Paenibacillus polymyxa strain SCE2 was shown to inhibit the growth of different potential human pathogenic bacterial strains and fungi in vitro. To determine the genetic characterization of this antimicrobial substance, strain SCE2 was transformed with plasmid pTV32(Ts), a delivery vector for Tn917-lac. After transposition, four mutants were shown to have lost their capability to inhibit Micrococcus sp. and Staphylococcus aureus RN450, but they continued to inhibit the growth of Corynebacterium fimi NCTC7547 and Escherichia coli HB101. Hybridization experiments using the DNA of the four mutants digested with different endonucleases and pTV32(Ts) as a probe showed that the place of insertion of Tn917-lac in the chromosome was the same in mutants 4 and 36 and in mutants 31 and 59, but different between these pairs. It is thought possible that more than one antimicrobial substance is being produced by strain SCE2.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Wedelia trilobata crude extracts.
AB  - A biological screening of activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, yeasts, and fungi of crude extracts from Wedelia trilobata is reported. The n-hexane extract showed antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis (Gram-positive bacteria); along with Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella group C, Salmonella paratyphi, and Shigella sonnei (Gram-negative bacteria). The ethyl acetate extract was active only against Salmonella group C; and the aqueous extract was inactive against the tested bacteria. None of the tested extracts showed biological activity against the yeasts (Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Rhodotorula rubra) or the fungi (Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Mucor sp., Trichophyton rubrum).
TI  - Conjugative mobilization of the rolling-circle plasmid pIP823 from Listeria monocytogenes BM4293 among gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - We determined the sequence and genetic organization of plasmid pIP823, which contains the dfrD gene; dfrD confers high-level trimethoprim resistance to Listeria monocytogenes BM4293 by synthesis of dihydrofolate reductase type S2. pIP823 possessed all the features of the pUB110/pC194 plasmid family, whose members replicate by the rolling-circle mechanism. The rep gene encoded a protein identical to RepU, the protein required for initiation of the replication of plasmids pTB913 from a thermophilic Bacillus sp. and pUB110 from Staphylococcus aureus. The mob gene encoded a protein with a high degree of amino acid identity with the Mob proteins involved in conjugative mobilization and interplasmidic recombination of pTB913 and pUB110. The host range of pIP823 was broad and included L. monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli. In all these species, pIP823 replicated by generating single-stranded DNA and was stable. Conjugative mobilization of pIP823 was obtained by self-transferable plasmids between L. monocytogenes and E. faecalis, between L. monocytogenes and E. coli, and between strains of E. coli, and by the streptococcal conjugative transposon Tn1545 from L. monocytogenes to E. faecalis, and from L. monocytogenes and E. faecalis to E. coli. These data indicate that the gene flux observed in nature from gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria can occur by conjugative mobilization. Our results suggest that dissemination of trimethoprim resistance in Listeria spp. and acquisition of other antibiotic resistance determinants in this species can be anticipated.
TI  - The biological activity of selected cyclic dipeptides.
AB  - Cyclic dipeptides are widely used as models for larger peptides because of their  simplicity and limited conformational freedom. Some cyclic dipeptides have been shown to be antiviral, antibiotic and anti-tumour. The aim of this study was to determine the biological activity of four cyclic dipeptides synthesized in this laboratory: cyclo(L-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl), cyclo(L-tyrosyl-L-prolyl), cyclo(L-tryptophanyl-L-prolyl) and cyclo(L-tryptophanyl-L-tryptophanyl). The enhancement or inhibition of calcium channels in ventricular myocytes from rats and delayed-rectifier potassium channels in ventricular myocytes from guinea-pigs were determined by use of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The induction of differentiation in HT-29 cells was assessed by assaying for an increase in the expression of alkaline phosphatase. Antibiotic properties against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilus and Streptococcus sp. were determined by use of the Kirby-Bauer disc-diffusion assay. Results from these assays indicate that the cyclic dipeptides have biological activity in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Three of the dipeptides block cation channels in ventricular myocytes and all increase the expression of alkaline phosphatase. All the dipeptides have concentration-dependent antibacterial properties. These results suggest that with increased solubility the cyclic dipeptides might have potential as muscle relaxants, anti-tumour compounds and antibiotics.
TI  - Bacterial infection and endotoxin in female reproductive tract in rats: correlation with the developmental status of preimplantation embryos.
AB  - During mammalian preimplantation development, a substantial numbers of embryos are believed to be lost for reasons that are unclear. Using female rats, we investigated whether the developmental status of embryos is influenced by bacterial infection and endotoxin in the reproductive tract. From the vagina of cycling rats (n = 11), 21 bacterial isolates were identified; they were Streptococcus faecalis (S. faecalis; 38%), Escherichia coli (E. coli; 19%), Acinetobactor calcoaceticus (A. calcoaceticus; 14%), and coagulase negative staphylococcus (14%), Micrococcus sp. (5%), Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis; 5%) and Proteus vulgaris (P. vulgaris; 5%). From the vagina of day 4 pregnant rats (n = 12), 26 isolates were identified; they were S. faecalis (23%), A. calcoaceticus (23%), E. coli (15%), Micrococcus sp. (15%), B. subtilis (8%), P. vulgaris (4%), Staphylococcus aureus (4%), beta-hemolytic streptococcus (4%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%). Gram negative bacteria found in the vagina of cycling and day 4 pregnant rats were 38% and 46%, respectively. In both, bacterial load was 10(3)-10(5) colony forming units and there was no association with the abnormality of the recovered embryos. However, in two day 4 pregnant animals, pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and beta-hemolytic streptococcus) were isolated and embryos recovered from them were degenerated and deformed. The vagina of day 9 pregnant animals (n = 7) were, however, sterile. Consistently, in all animals, the upper reproductive tract (uterus and oviduct) was devoid of any bacteria and no anaerobic bacteria were isolated from any part of the tract. The levels of endotoxin in the vagina of cycling and day 4 pregnant rats were 1.35 +/- 0.1 and 1.17 +/- 0.1 endotoxin units (EU), respectively. It was undetectable in the oviduct and uterus of all animals (n = 5) except one which showed high levels of endotoxin in uterus (4.5 EU) and oviduct (2.2 EU) and the animal also produced degenerated and deformed embryos. These results indicate that common bacterial flora of vagina may not affect embryo development and the presence of pathogenic bacteria in the vagina and/or endotoxin in reproductive tract could be detrimental to viability of gametes and preimplantation embryos in rats.
TI  - Mutations in Bartonella bacilliformis gyrB confer resistance to coumermycin A1.
AB  - This study describes the first isolation and characterization of spontaneous mutants conferring natural resistance to an antibiotic for any Bartonella species. The Bartonella bacilliformis gyrB gene, which encodes the B subunit of DNA gyrase, was cloned and sequenced. The gyrB open reading frame (ORF) is 2,079 bp and encodes a deduced amino acid sequence of 692 residues, corresponding to a predicted protein of approximately 77.5 kDa. Sequence alignment indicates that B. bacilliformis GyrB is most similar to the GyrB protein from Bacillus subtilis (40.1% amino acid sequence identity) and that it contains the longest N-terminal tail (52 residues) of any GyrB characterized to date. The cloned B. bacilliformis gyrB was expressed in an Escherichia coli S30 cell extract and was able to functionally complement a temperature-sensitive E. coli Cour gyrB mutant (strain N4177). We isolated and characterized spontaneous mutants of B. bacilliformis resistant to coumermycin A1, an antibiotic that targets GyrB. Sequence analysis of gyrB from 12 Cour mutants of B. bacilliformis identified single nucleotide transitions at three separate loci in the ORF. The predicted amino acid substitutions resulting from these transitions are Gly to Ser at position 124 (Gly124-->Ser), Arg184-->Gln, and Thr214-->Ala or Thr214-->Ile, which are analogous to mutated residues found in previously characterized resistant gyrB genes from Borrelia burgdorferi, E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Haloferax sp. The Cour mutants are three to five times more resistant to coumermycin A1 than the wild-type parental strain.
TI  - MJ347-81F4 A & B, novel antibiotics from Amycolatopsis sp.: taxonomic characteristics, fermentation, and antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Strain MJ347-81F4 has been found to produce two new cyclic thiazolyl peptide antibiotics, components A and B. Taxonomic studies including morphological and physiological characteristics and chemical analysis of whole cells of the producing strain revealed this microorganism to belong to genus Amycolatopsis, and so we designated the strain Amycolatopsis sp. MJ347-81F4. After 10 to 12 days of fermentation, most of the antibacterial activity was present mainly in the mycelial cake and reached its maximum level. In comparison with reference compounds, A as the major component showed excellent in vitro activity against gram-positive bacteria including highly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecalis with MICs in the range of concentration of 0.006 to to approximately 0.1 microg/ml. The results on the antimicrobial activity against thiazolyl peptide-resistant mutants of Bacillus subtilis NRRL B-558 indicated that the possible molecular target of MJ347-81F4 component A might be the 50S subunits of the ribosome, the inactivation of which would inhibit protein synthesis.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of two bacteriocins of Lactobacillus acidophilus LF221.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus LF221 produced bacteriocin-like activity against different bacteria including some pathogenic and food-spoilage species. Besides some lactic acid bacteria, the following species were inhibited: Bacillus cereus, Clostridium sp., Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus D. L. acidophilus LF221 produced at least two bacteriocins, acidocin LF221 A and acidocin LF221 B, which were purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction and reverse-phase FPLC. The antibacterial substances were heat-stable, sensitive to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, pepsin, pronase, proteinase K) and migrated as 3500- to 5000-Da proteins on sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The sequences of 46 amino-terminal amino acid residues of peptide A and 35 of peptide B were determined. Among the residues identified, no modified amino acids were found. No significant homology was found between the amino acid sequences of acidocin LF221 A and other bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria and 26% homology was found between acidocin LF221 B and brevicin 27. L. acidophilus LF221 may be of interest as a probiotic strain because of its human origin and inhibition of pathogenic bacteria, especially clostridium difficile.
TI  - Studying the effect of temperature on microbial growth using multiplicative model.
AB  - The specific growth rates of Brochothrix thermosphacta, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens at various temperatures were taken from the Food MicroModel database, and the data sets of specific growth rate versus temperature were fitted using the multiplicative model (r = a Td, r = specific growth rate; T = temperature; a, d = regression parameters). The exponential d-value derived from microbial growth at suboptimum temperatures reflected the effectiveness of temperature in enhancing growth. A microorganism with a large d-value exhibited a large increment of growth rate as temperature increased. The d-value of a microorganism was related to the temperature range for growth. The temperature range for the growth of psychrotrophs was usually narrow for B. thermosphacta and Y. enterocolitica; hence the d-values of these two psychrotrophs were close to 1 whereas d-values of mesophiles, such as B. cereus, E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., and S. aureus, were 2.31-2.90, and the d-value of C. perfringens, a thermophile, was 3.29. The values of parameter a of the model were affected by extra salt added into cultures. For all the strains mentioned above, the a-values decreased when the cultures contained higher levels of salt. The lowering of the a-value implied that the influence of temperature on the growth rate in the model was reduced. The change of the d-value was dependent on the capability of the microorganism to overcome the obstacle to growth and was affected by the composition of the nutrients and by inhibitory factors in the culture. The influence of environmental factors on the d-value was also found in Chinese sausages. The d-value of a dominant spoilage strain of Enterococcus sp. derived from sausages was 0.833 whereas the d-value derived from MRS cultures was 2.36. In refrigerated foods which usually contained some preservatives and were stored at low temperature, the d-value of psychrotrophic spoilage bacteria was around 1. In this case, the linear model could be a reasonable choice for predicting the proliferation of spoilage bacteria.
TI  - Expression and purification of epidermal cell differentiation inhibitor (EDIN) from Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - The expression of staphylococcal epidermal cell differentiation inhibitor (EDIN), an ADP-ribosyltransferase targeting the small GTP-binding protein rho p21, was examined using Bacillus subtilis. A recombinant plasmid, containing B. licheniformis alpha-amylase promoter flanking either a beta-glucanase or a B. cereus sphingomyelinase signal sequence, and a DNA fragment corresponding to mature EDIN were constructed and used to transform B. subtilis KN2. Transformants were designated ED7 and ED8, respectively. ED7 extracellularly produced recombinant protein, which was purified to homogeneity through column chromatography using SP-Toyopearl 650 cation-exchange gel and the HA1000 hydroxyapatite HPLC column. ED8 did not grow in broth culture. Biochemical and biological studies of purified protein revealed that ED7 produced a correctly processed recombinant EDIN, indistinguishable from natural EDIN.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive Streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain PonSSII.
AB  - An antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive Streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain PonSSII has been isolated and partially characterized. The antibiotic is produced throughout culture growth, with maximum amounts accumulating in the broth when the culture is in the early stationary phase of growth. The activity declines within about 30 h after the culture enters stationary phase. Purification techniques included chromatography on Amberlite XAD-2, DEAE Sephadex and SP Sephadex in addition to C18 HPLC with an average yield of 75%. This antibiotic only inhibits pathogenic strains of S. scabies that cause scab disease on potato and other tuberous vegetables and does not affect S. griseus, S. venezuelae, Actinomyces bovis, Nocardia asteroides, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli. The antibiotic has a molecular weight of 500 or less, and is stable for weeks at acidic pH but is very labile at alkaline pH conditions.
TI  - Bacterial flavohaemoglobins: a consensus sequence and identification of a discrete enterobacterial group and of further bacterial globins.
AB  - The amino acid sequences of haemoglobin-like proteins from the bacteria Alcaligenes eutrophus, Bacillus subtilis, Erwinia chrysanthemi, Escherichia coli, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vitreoscilla sp. and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae were studied. Phylogenies based on distance and parsimony analysis showed that the eubacterial group can be easily distinguished from the other haemoglobin-like proteins. The construction of a consensus bacterial flavohaemoglobin based on the alignment of six bacterial and one yeast globins allowed the design of consensus primers to search for haemoglobin-like genes in other bacteria. PCR products of the expected size were found in Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Rhizobium leguminosarum, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Expression of small RNAs by Bacillus sp. strain PS3 and B. subtilis cells during  sporulation.
AB  - A small RNA sequence identified in an rRNA-tRNA cluster from the thermophilic Bacillus sp. strain PS3 was examined. An oligonucleotide probe specific for the RNA bound to multiple restriction fragments in Bacillus sp. strain PS3 DNA, thus several copies of this sequence occur in its genome. Similar findings were observed using DNA from B. subtilis, B. stearothermophilus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Thermus thermophilus. This sequence apparently is widespread in the eubacteria. Northern analysis of RNA from sporulating Bacillus sp. strain PS3 and B. subtilis cells revealed RNA species homologous to the probe in both bacteria. Expression of the small RNA in B. subtilis depended on sigma H.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of food-related Penicillium sp. against pathogenic bacteria in laboratory media and a cheese model system.
AB  - Food-related Penicillium species (n = 34) and Geotrichum candidum (n = 11) grown  on Czapek Dox and brie agar were tested for their ability to suppress growth of pathogenic bacteria. Ten out of 13 P. camemberti showed antagonistic activity while the other species did not interact significantly with the bacterial growth. The order of inhibition was: Gram-negative bacteria and Bacillus cereus > Listeria monocytogenes, Lactococcus sp. > Micrococcus sp. whereas Lactobacillus sp., Staphylococcus aureus and some Micrococcus sp. were unaffected. When Salmonella typhimurium was inoculated together with P. camemberti P25 in brie agar, bacterial growth was inhibited during the first 6 d of incubation whereafter growth started. The inhibition of L. monocytogenes was similar but less pronounced. The antimicrobial activity produced by P. camemberti P25 and L84 was enhanced with increasing amount of sucrose in the medium. The activity was increased at low pH and destroyed at pH above 8. It was detectable at 15 degrees C but not at 37 degrees C indicating that volatile metabolites might be involved. No significant accumulation of organic acids and no secondary metabolites such as mycotoxins were detected. HSGC-MS analysis indicated that acetaldehyde, benzaldehyde, 3-methylbutanal and 1-octen-3-ol were produced by P. camemberti during the period when inhibitory activity was observed. Pure acetaldehyde and benzaldehyde were shown to be inhibitory to L. monocytogenes and Salm. typhimurium when grown at 15 degrees C and pH 5.5 and 7.0.
TI  - Selective killing of human monocytes and cytokine release provoked by sphingomyelinase (beta-toxin) of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The best-known activity of Staphylococcus aureus sphingomyelinase C, alias beta-toxin, is as a hemolysin that provokes hot-cold lysis of erythrocytes which contain substantial amounts of sphingomyelin in the plasma membrane. Sheep erythrocytes are most susceptible, and we found that one hemolytic unit, representing the toxin concentration that elicits 50% hemolysis of 2.5 X 10(8) erythrocytes per ml, corresponds to 0.05 enzyme units or to approximately 0.25 microg of sphingomyelinase per ml. The cytotoxic action of beta-toxin on nucleated cells has not been described in any detail before, and the present investigation was undertaken to fill this information gap. We now identify beta-toxin as a remarkably potent monocytocidal agent. At a concentration of 0.001 U/ml, corresponding to approximately 5 ng/ml, beta-toxin killed over 50% of human monocytes (10(6) cells per ml) within 60 min. By contrast, 1 to 5 microg of beta-toxin per ml had no cytocidal effects on human granulocytes, fibroblasts, lymphocytes, or erythrocytes. A selective monocytocidal action was also observed with sphingomyelinase C from Bacillus cereus and a Streptomyces sp., whereas phospholipase A2 and phospholipase D at 100 U/ml were without effect. Monocytes succumbing to the action of beta-toxin processed and released interleukin-1beta, soluble interleukin-6 receptor, and soluble CD14 into the supernatant. Thus, monocyte killing by beta-toxin is associated with cytokine-related events that are important for the initiation and progression of infectious disease. These findings uncover a potentially important role for sphingomyelinase as a determinant of microbial pathogenicity.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of autologous bone marrow during processing.
AB  - As part of an audit of the processing of autologous bone marrow, we found that marrow was often contaminated with organisms potentially pathogenic to neutropenic recipients. One of 14 marrows studied was found to be contaminated before the processing stage and five others became contaminated during processing. The organisms isolated at these stages were Propionibacterium sp., coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus and coryneforms, suggesting that the skin was the likely source of contamination. Five out of the 11 marrows returned to patients were found to be contaminated after thawing. Two of these were marrows previously shown to be contaminated with coagulase-negative staphylococci before freezing, and from these coagulase-negative staphylococci were isolated again, in one case the strains were indistinguishable. New organisms isolated after thawing included Bacillus sp. and Corynebacterium sporogenes suggesting contamination from the environment. No infections attributable to these organisms were demonstrated in any of the patients studied.
TI  - Influence of fowl uropygial gland and its secretory lipid components on growth of skin surface bacteria of fowl.
AB  - Bacterial species, which occur on the breast skin surface of adult (1 year old) white leghorn fowl with intact uropygial gland, were identified as : Staphylococcus epidermidis, Sarcina lutea, Streptomyces sp. and a facultative diphtheroid belonging to the genus Corynebacterium; S. epidermidis being the most predominant one. Two species of bacteria, namely, Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus sp. were shown to colonize the skin surface after 60 days of captivity. Extirpation of uropygial gland caused severe depletion of population of S. epidermidis, Streptomyces sp. and diphtheroid. The effect was more conspicuous after 60 days compared to that after 30 days of the gland removal. On the skin surface of glandless fowls the population of S. aureus increased significantly and a new form identified as anthracoid bacillus became the most predominant species after 60 days. Addition of total lipids from the free-flowing fowl uropygial secretion, as 0.2% suspension, to trypticase soya broth cultures of individual bacteria of fowl skin surface encouraged strongly the growth of S. epidermidis, Streptomyces sp. and Proteus sp. but suppressed the population of the anthracoid. When identical amount of diester wax or wax alcohol of the secretion was supplemented to the culture, more or less similar result was obtained. Wax alcohol also had a mild inhibitory effect on Streptomyces sp. Wax acids, added to the culture (0.2%) suppressed population of all the bacterial forms except Proteus sp., while the hydrocarbon fraction, which also contained some amount of squalene, produce an opposite effect.
TI  - Assessment of Difco ESP 384 blood culture system by terminal subcultures: failure to detect Cryptococcus neoformans in clinical specimens.
AB  - Terminal subcultures were performed on 1,162 5-day negative blood culture sets which had been monitored by the Difco ESP 384, a continuous-monitor blood culture system. Of these, 16 (1.4%) had growth upon terminal subculture. The isolates not detected by the Difco ESP 384 were Cryptococcus neoformans (eight isolates), Candida albicans (one isolate), Staphylococcus aureus (two isolates) coagulase-negative staphylococcus (three isolates), Bacillus sp. (one isolate), and Corynebacterium sp. (one isolate). Acridine orange staining was performed on 200 randomly selected negative blood culture sets from the study group. Of these, two sets were positive and grew out C. neoformans, as did the terminal subculture. A review of patient's medical records indicated that many of these false-negative isolates were clinically insignificant. The Difco ESP 384 failed to detect 1.4% of the isolates in this study, 50% of which were C. neoformans, indicating a deficiency in the detection mechanism of the system. Further studies demonstrated that while these isolates (C. neoformans) grew in the Difco media, the system did not detect this growth when the standard 5-day protocol was used.
TI  - Antibiotic GE37468 A: a new inhibitor of bacterial protein synthesis. I. Isolation and characterization.
AB  - GE37468 A is a new thiazolyl peptide antibiotic obtained by fermentation of Streptomyces sp. strain ATCC 55365. It inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by acting on elongation factor Tu and is structurally and functionally related to the GE2270 class of EF-Tu inhibitors. It is active in vitro against Gram-positive bacteria and Bacteroides fragilis, and protects mice against Staphylococcus aureus infection.
TI  - Microbial keratitis in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Posterior segment complications of systemic infection with the human  immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are well recognized. The anterior segment complications often are, however, overlooked. The author treated 20 episodes of nonherpetic infectious keratitis in 17 eyes of 13 patients infected with HIV who presented between August 1990 and May 1994. METHODS: Review of records. RESULTS: Nine patients were women, and four were men. Mean age was 35.2 years. The keratitis was bilateral in four patients, polymicrobial in four, and recurrent in two. The most common infecting organism was Candida albicans (5 eyes), a rare cause of keratitis in immunocompetent individuals. Other organisms included Staphylococcus aureus in four eyes, Staphylococcus epidermidis in four, Bacillus sp in two, and one each Pseudomonas aeruginosa, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus, Micrococcus sp, and Capnocytophaga sp. Seven eyes retained 20/30 or better visual acuity after treatment, eight had visual acuity of 20/50 or worse, and two were eviscerated. Classic predisposing factors for infectious keratitis were found in only two patients and included contact lens wear and atopy in one patient each. Twelve patients had a history of intravenous drug abuse. CONCLUSION: Infectious keratitis should be recognized as a complication of systemic HIV infection, especially in the context of drug abuse. The prognosis for recovery of vision in these patients often is poor.
TI  - Adherence of bacteria to intraocular lenses: a prospective study.
AB  - AIMS: The study was designed to investigate the bacterial flora of the operating  field during routine cataract surgery and the source of intraocular lens contamination during the surgery. METHODS: The normal flora of the external eye and fornices of 17 patients undergoing selective cataract surgery was determined preoperatively. Swabs taken from the eyelid surface and lashes showed coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) in 90%, Propionibacterium acnes in 62%, Corynebacterium sp in 18%, and Peptostreptococcus in 3% of the patients. The lower fornices of 70% had CNS, 47% P acnes, 6% Staphylococcus aureus, 6% Corynebacterium sp, and 6% Candida. RESULTS: A sterile PMMA intraocular lens was touched on the upper bulbar conjunctiva immediately before the surgery. Eighty two per cent of lenses grew CNS, 18% P acnes, 18% Bacillus sp, 12% S aureus, and 6% Corynebacterium sp. A second sterile PMMA intraocular lens was left on the drape and near the eye during surgery. Forty seven per cent of these cultured CNS, 12% Corynebacterium sp, and 6% Bacillus sp. A high count of bacteria in the operating field, especially CNS and P acnes can contribute to postoperative inflammation and endophthalmitis. CONCLUSION: Special measures are needed before and during the surgery to reduce the chance of intraocular inoculation of these bacteria. Use of proper culture media and techniques are necessary to identify these organisms, especially anaerobes, in postoperative inflammation.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of a non-radioactive gene probe for the detection of C.perfringens alpha toxin.
AB  - The synthesis and evaluation of a non-radioactive hybridization probe is described, specific detecting the Clostridium perfringens alphatoxin gene (plc) by colony blot hybridization assay. A vector free digoxigenin-dUTP-labelled probe was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the cloned plc gene of C.perfringens strain ATCC 13124. In a colony blot hybridization assay 296 strains of C.perfringens were tested for plc. None of the strains failed in hybridization. Presence of plc was even demonstrated in C.perfringens strains reported to lack lecithinase activity. Specificity of the probe was shown with various strains of other bacterial species. None different Clostridia sp. tested, e.g. C.bifermentans, C.tertium, C.novyi, C.chauvoei, C.sporogenes, C.difficile, C.putrifucum, C.sordellii, C.botulinum, C. septicum and C.histolyticum, hybridized with the plc specific probe. Strains expressing an enzymatically related phospholipase like Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus gave also negative results. Comparing the results of conventionally used egg yolk turbidity assay and those gained with DNA hybridization, the plc probe proved to be a much more sensitive and specific diagnostic tool for the detection of C.perfringens plc.
TI  - Prevalence of bacterial otitis media in primary school children in Enugu Surburb, Enugu state, Nigeria.
AB  - Out of a total school population of 3,070 pupils examined for discharging ear due to bacterial etiology, 44 (1.4%) had discharging ear. Forty eight species of bacteria belonging to 5 genera were isolated. These included, Staphylococcus aureus, 16 isolates; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 10; escherichia coli, 11; Proteus species, 7; Bacillus sp. 4. The highest prevalence of infection (3.0%) was recorded in central school Akwuke, Awkunanaw. Analysis of the data showed that infection rate was highest among the 6-9 year old age group (61%) and lowest among the 15 years and above age group (5%). Boys recorded a higher prevalence of infection (55%) than girls (45%). However the difference was not statistically significant (x = 2.08, p > 0.01). All the organisms isolated were sensitive to genticin but resistant to other commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - Mode of action of the lantibiotic mersacidin: inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis via a novel mechanism?
AB  - Mersacidin is an antibiotic peptide produced by Bacillus sp. strain HIL Y-85,54728 that belongs to the group of lantibiotics. Its activity in vivo against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains compares with that of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin (S. Chatterjee, D. K. Chatterjee, R. H. Jani, J. Blumbach, B. N. Ganguli, N. Klesel, M. Limbert, and G. Seibert, J. Antibiot. 45:839-845, 1992). Incubation of Staphylococcus simulans 22 with mersacidin resulted in the cessation of growth and slow lysis. Biosyntheses of DNA, RNA, and protein were not affected, whereas incorporation of glucose and D-alanine was inhibited and a regular reduction in the level of cell wall thickness was observed. Thus, unlike type A lantibiotics, mersacidin does not form pores in the cytoplasmic membrane but rather inhibits cell wall biosynthesis. Comparison with tunicamycin-treated cells indicated that peptidoglycan rather than teichoic acid metabolism is primarily affected. Mersacidin caused the excretion of a putative cell wall precursor into the culture supernatant. The formation of polymeric peptidoglycan was effectively inhibited in an in vitro assay, probably on the level of transglycosylation. In contrast to vancomycin, the activity of mersacidin was not antagonized by the tripeptide diacetyl-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala, indicating that on the molecular level its mode of action differs from those of glycopeptide antibiotics. These data together with electron microscopy suggest that mersacidin acts on a novel target, which opens new perspectives for the treatment of methicillin-resistant S. aureus.
TI  - Oceanapamine, a sesquiterpene alkaloid from the Philippine sponge Oceanapia sp.
AB  - The major metabolite of the Philippine sponge Oceanapia sp. is the antimicrobial  alkaloid oceanapamine [1], which was isolated as a trifluoroacetate salt. The structure and the absolute configuration of oceanapamine, which consists of a monocyclic sesquiterpene attached to a histamine residue, were elucidated by interpretation of spectroscopic data.
TI  - Survival and growth of selected pathogens in fermented kocho (Ensete ventricosum).
AB  - A study was conducted to investigate the antagonistic potential of fermented kocho, aqueous extract of fermented kocho and spent media from lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from it on Salmonella sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella sp, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus. Fermented kocho (pH 4.3) inhibited growth of the test bacteria soon after their introduction into the food. The spent media from all of the four LAB, isolated from fermented kocho, namely Pediococcus sp, Leuconostoc sp, Lactobacillus sp and Streptococcus sp prevented the survival and growth of the test bacteria. The spent medium from Streptococcus sp showed the best antagonistic effect amongst all the LAB isolates. In all cases the inhibitory effects were independent of pH.
TI  - Plasmids designed to alter the antibiotic resistance expressed by insertion mutations in Bacillus subtilis, through in vivo recombination.
AB  - Numerous insertion mutations conferring resistance to antibiotics are available in Bacillus subtilis. However, many of them have been constructed in vitro by inserting genes from the Staphylococcus aureus plasmids, pC194 or pE194, conferring resistance to chloramphenicol (Cm) or erythromycin (Er). Others are insertions of the Enterococcus faecalis Tn917 transposon conferring resistance to Er. This paucity of resistance markers has been limiting the possibilities of constructing and studying mutants carrying two or more of these mutations in the past. We constructed plasmids which can be used to change the antibiotic resistance expressed by preexisting chromosomal insertions, through transformation and homologous recombination. These vectors replace the pre-existing resistance to Cm or Er with new resistances to neomycin (Nm), phleomycin (Pm), spectinomycin (Sp) or tetracycline (Tc).
TI  - The femC locus of Staphylococcus aureus required for methicillin resistance includes the glutamine synthetase operon.
AB  - Tn551 insertional inactivation of femC is known to reduce methicillin resistance  levels in methicillin-resistant and -susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. By use of cotransductional crosses, femC was mapped close to thrB on the SmaI-A fragment of the S. aureus NCTC 8325 chromosome. The Tn551 insertion femC::omega 2005 was found to interrupt an open reading frame coding for a putative protein of 121 amino acids which is highly similar to the glutamine synthetase repressors (GlnR) of Bacillus spp. Downstream of femC, an open reading frame highly similar to Bacillus sp. glutamine synthetases (GlnA) was found. Northern (RNA) blots probed with putative glnR or glnA fragments revealed that 1.7- and 1.9-kb transcripts characteristic of wild-type cells were replaced by less abundant 7.0- and 7.2-kb transcripts in the femC::omega 2005 mutant. Total glutamine synthetase activity was also decreased in the mutant strain; the addition of glutamine to defined media restored the wild-type methicillin resistance phenotype of the femC mutant. This result suggests that the omega 2005 insertion in glnR has a polar effect on glnA and that glnR and glnA are transcribed together as an operon. These results suggest that the loss of wild-type levels of glutamine synthetase and the consequent decrease in glutamine availability cause a decreased level of methicillin resistance.
TI  - Low surface tension calcium hydroxide solution is an effective antiseptic.
AB  - The antimicrobial effects of a saturated calcium hydroxide solution, and in combination with 10% and 20% detergent, were evaluated on Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Neisseria sp., diphtheroid, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus sp., Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis and Candida albicans. The saturated calcium hydroxide solution was effective against only four of the 11 microorganisms studied over a 60-min exposure time. The calcium hydroxide solutions containing detergent killed all 11 test organisms over a 30-min exposure time. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0.01). No statistically significant difference in antimicrobial action was found between the 10% and 20% detergent calcium hydroxide solutions (P > 0.01). However, the low surface tension (46.5 x 10(-3) Nm-1) and high pH (10.8) of the calcium hydroxide solution with 20% detergent establish it as the more effective solution.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of a quick drying rubbing type povidone-iodine alcoholic disinfectant solution.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of a quick drying rubbing type disinfectant (HAD Hand Wash) composed of a povidone-iodine (PVP-I) and ethanol were evaluated in the disinfection of transient skin flora on fingers of 30 medical staff of our department. Three millilitres of HAD solution was rubbed onto the hands for three minutes several times a day over a four week period. Bacteriological effects were evaluated twice, on the first day and after four weeks, by the palm stamp method. The rate of colonies sterilized (bacterial reduction rate) after the use of HAD Hand Wash was 86.9 +/- 21.2% (mean +/- SD) on the first measurement, and 91.5% +/- 12.8% at four weeks. Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated most frequently and this was eradicated in 83.3% of subjects, the bacterial reduction rate 99.7%. Staphylococcus aureus was originally isolated in 14 subjects and was eradicated in 13; the bacterial colony reduction rate was 99.9% showing high antiseptic efficacy. Although the bacterial reduction rate for Bacillus sp. was a rather low, 75.8-100%, this result was not considered problematic from the clinical standpoint. There were no side effects like chapping in spite of an average 104 applications of HAD Hand Wash during the 4-week test period. From these results, HAD Hand Wash was considered highly effective and safe.
TI  - A study of five bacteriophages of the Myoviridae family which replicate on different gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - A comparative study is reported on five phages of the Myoviridae family which propagate on Bacillus subtilis, B. thuringiensis, Enterococcus sp., Lactobacillus plantarum, or Staphylococcus aureus. The phages are morphologically identical and characterized by isometric heads with conspicuous capsomers and by contractile tails with complex base plates. The phages show similar protein profiles, but vary considerably in burst size. Phage DNAs are about 95-166 kb in size and are unrelated by DNA-DNA hybridization and restriction endonuclease analysis. Therefore the phages are unrelated at species level. Implications of these data for our understanding of the development of phage species are discussed.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of new heterocyclic structures: [1,3]thiazino[2,3-i]purine, thiazolo[3,2-c] [1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-e]pyrimidine and [1,2,3]triazolo [4', 5': 4,5] pyrimido[6,1-b][1,3]thiazine.
AB  - Some derivatives of thiazolo[3,2-c]pyrimidine, pyrimido[6,1-b][1,3]thiazine, thiazolo[2,3-i]purine, [1,3]thiazino[2,3-i]purine, thiazolo[3,2-c][1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-e]pyrimidine and [1,2,3]triazolo[4',5':4,5]pyrimido[6,1-b][1,3]thiazine were prepared. The compounds were tested for antimicrobial and antimycotic activity on a number of strains, namely, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Sarcina lutea, Candida albicans, Aspergillus sp., and for antiviral activity on Herpes simplex virus, Type 1 (HSV-1), Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Coxsackievirus B5 (CoxB5). The compounds proved to be devoid of activity against viruses, mycetes and gram-negative bacteria, while some of them exhibited a modest activity against gram-positive bacterial strains.
TI  - DNA sequence and analysis of a cryptic 4.2-kb plasmid from the filamentous cyanobacterium, Plectonema sp. strain PCC 6402.
AB  - The 4194-bp plasmid, pRF1, from Plectonema sp. Strain PCC 6402 was completely sequenced and analyzed. Seven potential open reading frames were identified. The predicted amino acid sequence of open reading frame C (ORF C) had identities of 34, 29, and 25% with Rep B from the Staphylococcus aureus plasmid, pUB110; Rep from the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens plasmid, pFTB14; and protein A from the S. aureus plasmid, pC194, respectively. A 75-amino-acid region conserved in these proteins (Rep B, Rep, and protein A) also was highly conserved in ORF C with identities of 45, 37, and 40%, respectively. Significantly, 16 of the 21 amino acids conserved in Rep B, Rep, and protein A were found at the same positions in ORF C. This ORF may encode a replication protein that includes a region conserved in some eubacteria. Additional structural features include a 425-bp region that contains palindromes, tandem repeats, and short direct repeats which may correspond to the origin of replication. An 18-bp inverted repeat was located between two open reading frames, A and G.
TI  - New bioactive metabolites from a freshwater isolate of the fungus Kirschsteiniothelia sp.
AB  - The new cytotoxic naphthoquinone dimer kirschsteinin [5], two new chlorinated diphenyl ethers 8 and 9, three known naphthoquinone derivatives 1, 2, and 7, a monoacetyl derivative of 2, and the (-)-enantiomer of O-methylasparvenone [4], have been isolated from a previously undescribed species of Kirschsteiniothelia. The structures of these compounds were assigned primarily by nmr studies and by spectral comparisons.
TI  - Isolation and amino acid sequence of a glutamic acid specific endopeptidase from  Bacillus licheniformis.
AB  - An endopeptidase cleaving specifically at the carboxyl side of acidic amino acid  residues, preferentially at glutamic acid, has been isolated from a commercial extract obtained by fermentation with Bacillus licheniformis. Using ion-exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography on bacitracin-Sepharose, it was possible, from 100 ml commercial extract, to isolate 100 mg homogeneous enzyme in a yield of 50%. It is the first description of a large-scale isolation of a Glu/Asp-specific enzyme. The preparation was essentially free of contaminating activities. The isolated enzyme consists of one peptide chain of 222 amino acid residues and has a calculated molecular mass of 23,589 Da. The determined amino acid sequence shows similarity to the Glu/Asp-specific enzymes previously isolated from Staphylococcus aureus V8, Actinomyces sp. and Streptomyces thermovulgaris. The substrate preference of the enzyme has been investigated. Although non-specific cleavages were observed after prolonged hydrolysis at high enzyme concentrations the enzyme appears to be essentially specific for Glu-Xaa and Asp-Xaa, with strong preference for the former. The isolated enzyme exhibits a bell-shaped pH/activity profile with an optimum at pH 7.5-8.0. The activity is adversely affected by high ionic strength and beneficially affected by the inclusion of calcium ions in the assay medium. The enzyme is completely inhibited by diisopropylfluorophosphate, suggesting that it is a serine endopeptidase. It is partially inhibited by EDTA.
TI  - Comparison of the sequences of class A beta-lactamases and of the secondary structure elements of penicillin-recognizing proteins.
AB  - The sequences of class A beta-lactamases were compared. Four main groups of enzymes were distinguished: those from the gram-negative organisms and bacilli and two distinct groups of Streptomyces spp. The Staphylococcus aureus PC1 enzyme, although somewhat closer to the enzyme from the Bacillus group, did not belong to any of the groups of beta-lactamases. The similarities between the secondary structure elements of these enzymes and those of the class C beta-lactamases and of the Streptomyces sp. strain R61 DD-peptidase were also analyzed and tentatively extended to the class D beta-lactamases. A unified nomenclature of secondary structure elements is proposed for all the penicillin-recognizing enzymes.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of pyrimido[2,1-b][1,3]thiazine, [1,3]thiazino[3,2-a]purine and [1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-d][1,3]thiazino[3,2-a]pyrimidine derivatives and thiazole analogues.
AB  - Some series of thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidine, pyrimido[2,1-b] [1,3]thiazine, thiazolo[3,2-a]purine, [1,3]thiazino[3,2-a]purine, thiazolo[3,2-a][1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidine and [1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-d][1,3]thiazino[3,2-a]pyrimidine derivatives, variously functionalized, were prepared. The compounds were tested for antimicrobial and antimycotic activity on a number of strains, namely: E. coli, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp., Staphylococcus aureus, S. faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Sarcina lutea, Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, Aspergillus sp., and for antiviral activity on Herpes simplex virus Type 1, Vesicular stomatitis virus and Coxsackievirus B5. The compounds proved to be devoid of activity against viruses and gram-negative bacteria, while some of them exhibited modest activity against gram-positive bacterial strains.
TI  - The effect of physical and microbiological factors on food container leakage.
AB  - The effect of physical and microbiological factors on food container leakage was  investigated in a container leakage model system (CLMS). The leakage of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Staphylococcus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Bacillus sp., a coryneform, Staph. aureus, and two biotest organisms (Enterobacter cloacae NC1B 8151 and Ent. aerogenes MB31) was studied. The rate of bacterial leakage (log10 cells/channel/s) was greater in the presence of a partial vacuum of 51-305 mm Hg than at atmospheric pressure. Fluid flow (ml) through leakage channels was increased by the application of vacuum. Leakage varied with vacuum, bacterial morphology, cell concentration, leakage channel size (0.78-120 micron 2) and channel shape (straight or convoluted). The number of leaked cells was not proportional to vacuum or channel size. The effect of channel shape varied with bacterial species. Increased container medium viscosity decreased bacterial leakage. Fluid flow through leakage channels was generally reduced by the most viscous solution. Cells from biofilms and monolayers of Ac. calcoaceticus or Staph. aureus attached to nylon (Hyfax) or stainless steel surfaces underwent leakage. Mixed bacterial populations had characteristic leakage rates against vacuum different from the leakage pattern of individual species in the population. The composition of the leaked population was different from the original inoculum. The results indicated that container leakage is a complex process involving a range of interdependent factors.
TI  - Lactobacillus hilgardii plasmid pLAB1000 consists of two functional cassettes commonly found in other gram-positive organisms.
AB  - A Lactobacillus hilgardii plasmid, pLAB1000, was studied to understand the organization of autonomous replicons from lactobacilli. Two cassettes could be identified. First, the replication region consisted of a sequence coding for a replication protein (Rep) and its corresponding target site, similar to those from plasmids pUB110, pC194 (Staphylococcus aureus), pFTB14, pBAA1 (Bacillus sp.), and pLP1 (Lactobacillus sp.). Sequence analysis indicated the possible synthesis of an antisense RNA that might regulate Rep production. The results also suggested that pLAB1000 replicates via a single-stranded DNA intermediate, and a putative lagging-strand initiation site was found that had similarities to those of alpha 3, St-1, and G4 isometric bacteriophages. The second cassette of pLAB1000 consisted of a sequence coding for a putative mobilization protein (Mob) and its corresponding RSA site. This cassette was similar to those found in pT181, pUB110, pE194 (S. aureus), and pG12 (Bacillus sp.), and it was found to be conserved among different Lactobacillus plasmid replicons. The origin and evolution of these functional cassettes are also discussed.
TI  - Bacteriological study of extracted IUCDs.

TI  - AT2433-A1, AT2433-A2, AT2433-B1, and AT2433-B2 novel antitumor antibiotic compounds produced by Actinomadura melliaura. Taxonomy, fermentation, isolation and biological properties.
AB  - Compounds AT2433-A1 (A1), AT2433-A2 (A2), AT2433-B1 (B1), and AT2433-B2 (B2) were isolated from the cultured broth of Actinomadura melliaura sp. nov. (SCC 1655). Structurally these materials are closely related to rebeccamycin (1), an indolocarbazole antitumor antibiotic. A1, A2, B1, and B2 were active against Staphylococcus aureus A9537, Streptococcus faecalis A20688, Streptococcus faecium (ATCC 9790), Micrococcus lutea (ATCC 9341), Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6633). A1 and B1 were active against P388 leukemia in mice.
TI  - Detection of bacterial cell wall hydrolases after denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  - Cell walls from various Gram-positive bacteria were incorporated at a concentration of 0.2% (w/v) into polyacrylamide gels as a substrate for detection of cell wall hydrolases. Bacterial extracts from crude cell wall preparations were denatured with sodium dodecyl sulfate and 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in gels containing bacterial cell walls. After renaturation in the presence of purified and buffered 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, cell wall hydrolases were visualized as clear lytic zones against the opaque cell wall background. One to fifteen bands with lytic activity could be detected, depending on bacterial extracts and on the nature of the cell walls incorporated into gels. Crude cell wall extracts were the best source of cell wall hydrolases from various Gram-positive bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens (15 bands), Micrococcus luteus (1 band), Bacillus megaterium (4 bands), Bacillus sp. (6 bands), B. cereus (3 bands), B. subtilis (7 bands), Staphylococcus aureus (13 bands), Streptococcus faecalis (3 bands), and Strep. pyogenes (5 bands). Molecular masses of cell wall hydrolases ranged from 17 to 114.6 kDa. Lytic activities against cell walls of Corynebacterium sepedonicum (Clavibacter michiganense pv. sepedonicum) could be shown with the cell wall extracts of Strep. pyogenes (45.7 kDa), Strep. faecalis (67 kDa), B. megaterium (67 kDa), and Staph. aureus (67 kDa).
TI  - [A sarcoma-static new species of Pseudomonas, Pseudomonas jinanensis sp. nov].
AB  - A strain of Gram negative bacteria was isolated from the surface soil of Wuying Hill at Jinan, Shandong province with Gause's medium in 1973. It is a strain of antagonistic bacteria for hysterocervicoma, hepatoma and melanoma of mice screened from 2100 strains of bacteria. It is also antagonistic to Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus. It is a Gram negative bacterium with lophotrichous polar flagella. Straight rods in shape or with a little slightly curved rods, 0.5-0.6 X 1-2 microns, randomly arranged, poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate granules are accumulated in cells after 2-5 days cultivation. Water green soluble pigment and green fluorescent pigment are produced. Respiratory metabolism, chemoorganotroph, many carbon-containing organic compounds can be used as carbon sources, such as glucose, trehalose, ethanol, cellulobiose, fucose, arginine and betaine, but propionic acid or tartaric acid is not utilized. Inorganic nitrogen containing compounds can be used ae the sole source of nitrogen. No growth factor is necessary for growth. Gelatin is hydrolyzed. Starch and cellulose are not hydrolyzed. Nitrate is not reduced. Arginine dihydrolase is produced. Levan is produced from sucrose. Growth occurs from 7 degrees C to 37 degrees C and from pH 5.65-8.40. No growth occurs at 40 degrees C and at pH value below 4.86. It can not grow autotrophically with hydrogen. Its G + C contents in DNA is 58.1 mol%. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments reveals a relatedness value of 58.6% between this strain and Ps. fluorescens. The above evidence shows that this strain differs from all species known in Pseudomonas, such as Pseudomonas fluorescens group. Pseudomonas caryophylli, Pseudomonas cepacia, Pseudomonas marginata, Pseudomonas acidovorans, Pseudomonas testosteroni and Pseudomonas delafieldii.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Screening of isoquinoline alkaloids and their derivatives for antibacterial and antifungal activities.
AB  - A screening test of antimicrobial activities for some of the isoquinoline alkaloids and their first and second Hofmann elimination products was conducted in this study. Results showed that (+)-actinodaphnine (1), (+)-N-Me-actinodaphnine (2), (+)-anonaine (17), (-)-xylopine (19) and (-)-N-Me-xylopine MeI (20), had the strongest inhibitory activities against three G(+) bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus sp. and Staphylococcus aureus) MIC greater than or equal to 50 micrograms/ml). Whereas anhydroushinsunine (34), anhydroushinsunine MeI (35), ushinsunine isomethine (38), dicentrine methine (23), roemerine methine (26), dicentrine bismethine (29) and O-Me-armepavine methine (48) also had antibacterial effects against these same three G(+) bacteria (MIC = 50-300 micrograms/ml). However, only (+)-actinodaphnine (1) and roemerine methine (26) showed weak effects against two G(-) bacteria (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia) (MIC = 300 micrograms/ml). (+)-Actinodaphnine(1), (+)-N-Me-actinodaphnine (2), (+)-anonaine (17), anhydroushinsunine (34), anhydroushinsunine MeI (35), ushinsunine isomethine (38), O-Me-armepavine methine (48) and O,O-di-Et-N-Me-coclaurine methine (49) had potent antifungal activities against Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and other Candida species (MIC = 62.5-1000 micrograms/ml).
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of a chromosomal mercury resistance determinant from a Bacillus sp. with broad-spectrum mercury resistance.
AB  - A 13.5-kilobase HindIII fragment, bearing an intact mercury resistance (mer) operon, was isolated from chromosomal DNA of broad-spectrum mercury-resistant Bacillus sp. strain RC607 by using as a probe a clone containing the mercury reductase (merA) gene. The new clone, pYW33, expressed broad-spectrum mercury resistance both in Escherichia coli and in Bacillus subtilis, but only in B. subtilis was the mercuric reductase activity inducible. Sequencing of a 1.8-kilobase mercury hypersensitivity-producing fragment revealed four open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 may code for a regulatory protein (MerR). ORF2 and ORF4 were associated with cellular transport function and the hypersensitivity phenotype. DNA fragments encompassing the merA and the merB genes were sequenced. The predicted Bacillus sp. strain RC607 MerA (mercuric reductase) and MerB (organomercurial lyase) were similar to those predicted from Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pI258 (67 and 73% amino acid identities, respectively); however, only 40% of the amino acid residues of RC607 MerA were identical to those of the mercuric reductase from gram-negative bacteria. A 69-kilodalton polypeptide was isolated and identified as the merA gene product by examination of its amino-terminal sequence.
TI  - Some factors affecting isolation of Clostridium tetani from human and animal stools.
AB  - Clostridium tetani was isolated from human and animal stools at the following rates [95% confidence interval (CI)]: Human, 0% (1.5-0); horse, 1% (5-0); cow in cowshed, 4% (10-1); cow in pasture, 8.3% (17-1), calf in pasture, 0% (7-0); dog, 2% (11-0) and sheep in pasture, 25% (44-14). Quantification of C. tetani in 16 animal stools positive for the bacillus was impossible in most cases, as the number of tetanus bacilli present was not large enough for this purpose. Contaminating anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria in human and animal stools, i.e., C. perfringens and Streptococcus sp., Group G, inhibited isolation of C. tetani from these materials, particularly at the step of isolation employing its swarming character.
TI  - Origin of organisms infecting ventricular shunts.
AB  - Results of skin cultures obtained before 413 of 505 operations for cerebrospinal  fluid-diverting ventricular shunt placement or revision in a pediatric population from April 1980 to May 1983 are analyzed and compared to results of cultures from 20 subsequent shunt infections. Sensitivities to 11 different antibiotics were determined for each isolate cultured. The total operative infection rate was 20 of 505 (4%). Gram-negative bacilli alone accounted for 3 of 20 (15%) shunt infections. One gram-negative bacillus/Staphylococcus aureus infection occurred. Factors predisposing for gram-negative bacillus shunt infection were found in all 4 cases. The majority of shunt infections were caused by typical resident skin organisms: Staphylococcus epidermidis alone, 9/20 (45%); Staphylococcus aureus alone, 4/20 (20%); Corynebacterium sp., 1/20 (5%); alpha-Streptococcus with S. epidermidis, 1/20 (5%); and Micrococcus with S. epidermidis, 1/20 (5%). Only 4 (20%) of the 20 shunt infections were due to organisms identical to those originally grown from the skin. Another 4 (20%) seemed to be infected with a strain of organism different from that initially recovered from the skin. The remaining skin organism shunt infections may or may not have come from the patient's skin. The data suggest that not all skin organism shunt infections arise from contamination by resident skin bacteria at the incision sites at the time of operation. Alternate sources for the infecting organisms are discussed. The antibiotic sensitivity data on skin isolates and shunt isolates suggest that vancomycin is the antibiotic best suited for prophylaxis against shunt infection at our institution.
TI  - Evaluation of three disinfectants after in-use stress.
AB  - Solutions of 2.0% and 3.4% glutaraldehyde, and of 0.5% phenate with 0.18% glutaraldehyde were stressed with a microbial and organic soil load for the periods advocated by the respective manufacturers. The disinfecting efficacy of the stressed solutions was challenged with Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Mycobacterium bovis (BCG), a water Mycobacterium sp. and Candida albicans. The three disinfectants were active against the fast-growing bacteria in appropriate dilutions; lesser dilutions of the glutaraldehyde solutions killed the mycobacteria and the yeast, while stressed phenate with glutaraldehyde did not. One hour exposure of the stressed disinfectants failed to kill the spore preparations while reducing the number of survivors.
TI  - Antibiotic activity of the pyrenocines.
AB  - Pyrenocine A, a phytotoxin produced by Pyrenochaeta terrestris (Hansen) Gorenz, Walker and Larson, possesses general antibiotic activity against plants, fungi, and bacteria. Effective doses for 50% inhibition (ED50s) are 4 micrograms/mL for onion seedling elongation; 14, 20, 20, and 25 micrograms/mL for the germination of asexual spores of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cepae, Fusarium solani f. sp. pisi, Mucor hiemalis, and Rhizopus stolonifer, respectively. Pyrenocine A also inhibits the linear mycelial growth of both P. terrestris and F. oxysporum with ED50s calculated as 77 and 54 micrograms/mL, respectively. Gram-positive bacteria are more susceptible to pyrenocine A than Gram-negative bacteria. ED50s are estimated as 30, 45, and 200 micrograms/mL for the inhibition of growth of Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli, respectively, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to those concentrations tested. Pyrenocine A acts primarily as a biostatic rather than a biocidal agent with all organisms tested showing some degree of recovery when released from pyrenocine A. Pyrenocines B and C show little antibiotic activity in the bioassays performed.
TI  - The nosocomial colonization of T. Bear.
AB  - A national effort to reduce nosocomial infections includes a program developed at the National Institutes of Health to encourage handwashing in hospitals and day care centers. The program promotes a symbolic teddy bear (T. Bear) with slogans to remind hospital personnel and patients to practice handwashing. One of the items used is a stuffed toy T. Bear to be dispensed to the hospitalized child. Considering the manner in which children handle stuffed toys, we suspected the T. Bear might serve as a "fomite" for transmission of nosocomial microbes. A prospective study of 39 sterilized T. Bears revealed that all became colonized with bacteria, fungi, or both within 1 week of hospitalization. Hospital acquired organisms cultured from the T. Bear included Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, alpha streptococci, Corynebacterium acnes, Micrococcus sp, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Bacillus sp, and species of Candida, Cryptococcus, Trichosporon, Aspergillus and others. Concomitant cultures of the patients revealed similar isolates. Although the T. Bear handwashing campaign should not be discredited, the promotional toy may pose an unnecessary expense and hazard and should not be used in hospitals or day care centers.
TI  - [Aerobic bacterial flora of the nasal cavity of rabbits].
AB  - On the basis of bacteriological examinations carried out in April 1984 on 60 intranasal swabs, aerobic respiratory microbes were studied in rabbits. Differences in flora between animals with and without respiratory diseases were studied. Fourteen bacterial species were identified with no difference due to the pathological status. They were: Bordetella bronchiseptica, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus sp., Branhamella catarrhalis, Micrococcus sp., Enterobacter agglomerans, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas paucimobilis, Pseudomonas diminuta, Alcaligenes faecalis and Escherichia coli. However, young weaned rabbits were more often Pasteurella carriers than adult females in maternity. The usefulness of performing only Pasteurella and Bordetella cultures in rabbits is questionable as is use of vaccines in order to prevent bacterial respiratory syndrome. It is emphasised that myxomatosis should be pursued in the investigation of respiratory infections in rabbit.
TI  - A note on antibiotic resistance in the bacterial flora of raw sewage and sewage-polluted River Tigris in Mosul, Iraq.
AB  - Polluted water samples collected from the River Tigris in the vicinity of a raw sewage outfall were examined for the incidence of antibiotic resistance among coliform bacteria on three occasions during 1983. Eighty percent or more of the coliform bacteria were resistant to one or more antibiotics. At the same time, raw sewage samples were examined for the incidence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas spp. and Staphylococcus spp. were selected for sensitivity testing. Collectively, more than 90% of the 480 strains of the three organisms were resistant to one or more antibiotics. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ampicillin for twenty-nine strains including coliforms, E. coli, Klebsiella sp., Serratia sp., Ps. aeruginosa, Pseudomonas sp., Micrococcus sp., Staph. aureus, Streptococcus faecalis and Bacillus sp. from raw sewage and polluted River Tigris water was determined and that for Ps. aeruginosa was 250 micrograms/ml. The high incidence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in natural waters could be related to the widespread use of antibiotics in this locality.
TI  - Bacterial flora of airline headset devices.
AB  - External otitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus was observed in two patients after they wore airline headset devices. The bacterial flora of 40 headset devices was evaluated. Bacteria were recovered from all headsets, and the number of organisms ranged from 10 to 1,200 (mean 138 +/- 246 organisms per headset). The predominant organisms recovered were S. aureus (in 12 headsets), Bacillus sp. and S. epidermidis (ten headsets each), alpha-hemolytic streptococci (in eight) and Corynebacterium sp. (in six). The effect of wearing a sterile headset for an hour was investigated using 20 volunteers. After wearing the headsets, an increase of at least two log10 colony-forming units was observed in 11 (55 per cent) of the volunteers, a decrease was observed in one (5 per cent), and no significant change in the bacterial flora was noticed in eight (40 per cent). The study demonstrates the presence of potential pathogens in headset devices and the increase in the number of endogenous flora in individuals who wear these devices.
TI  - Effect of saccharin on growth and acid production of glucose-grown pathogenic and oral bacteria.
AB  - Growth and acid production of glucose-grown Gram-positive and Gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02 to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. All Gram-positive rods, i.e. Actinomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bacillus subtilis and Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and Gram-positive cocci, i.e. Streptococcus spp, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. While Gram-negative cocci, i.e. Veillonella sp and Neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, Gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and Acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. Saccharin caused a significant reduction in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.
TI  - Minimum bacterial density for bacteriophage replication: implications for significance of bacteriophages in natural ecosystems.
AB  - Bacteriophage 80 alpha did not increase in number in cultures containing less than about 1.0 X 10(4) to 1.5 X 10(4) CFU of Staphylococcus aureus per ml, but bacteriophage replication did occur when the number of bacteria exceeded this density, either initially or as a result of host cell multiplication. The minimum density of an asporogenous strain of Bacillus subtilis required for an increase in the number of bacteriophage SP beta cI was about 3 X 10(4) CFU/ml. The threshold density of Escherichia coli for the multiplication of bacteriophage T4 was about 7 X 10(3) CFU/ml. In the presence of montmorillonite, bacteriophage T4 did not increase in number until the E. coli population exceeded 10(4) CFU/ml. The mineralization of glucose was not affected in E. coli cultures inoculated with a low number of bacteriophage T4, but it could not be detected in cultures inoculated with a large number of phage. The numbers of bacteriophage T4 and a bacteriophage that lyses Pseudomonas putida declined rapidly after being added to lake water or sewage. We suggest that bacteriophages do not affect the number or activity of bacteria in environments where the density of the host species is below the host cell threshold of about 10(4) CFU/ml.
TI  - Role of resistance to starvation in bacterial survival in sewage and lake water.
AB  - A study was conducted to determine the significance of starvation resistance to the ability of a species to survive in sewage and lake water. Tests were conducted for periods of up to 14 days. Rhizobium meliloti and one fluorescent and one nonfluorescent strain of Pseudomonas were resistant to starvation because their population sizes did not fall appreciably in buffer and sterile lake water, and the first two maintained high numbers after being added to sterile sewage. Cell densities of these bacterial species dropped slowly in nonsterile sewage, and more cells of these three organisms than of the other test organisms remained in nonsterile lake water. Rhizobium leguminosarum was moderately resistant to starvation because its numbers fell slowly in buffer and sterile lake water and did not change appreciably in sterile sewage. The abundance of Micrococcus flavus added to buffer and sterile lake water did not change, but the density of M. flavus declined in nonsterile lake water. The abundance of R. leguminosarum fell in nonsterile lake water and nonsterile sewage. Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, an asporogenous strain of Bacillus subtilis, and Streptococcus sp. were susceptible to starvation because their populations were markedly reduced in buffer. Populations of the last three species declined rapidly in nonsterile and sterile samples of lake water and sewage. S. faecalis declined rapidly when added to nonsterile lake water and sewage and sterile lake water but not when added to sterile sewage, the persistence in the last instance probably being associated with the availability of organic nutrients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - DC-52, a novel antitumor antibiotic. 1. Taxonomy, fermentation and biological activity.
AB  - A novel antitumor antibiotic, DC-52 was found in the culture broths of Actinomycete DO-52. The producing organism was subsequently determined to be a new species and named Streptomyces melanovinaceus nov. sp. For the production of the antibiotic, soluble starch served as a good carbon source and soybean meal was a good nitrogen source tested. The antibiotic DC-52 is active against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae, but not active against most Gram-negative bacteria. The antibiotic is also active against mouse leukemia P388.
TI  - Isolations of aerobic bacteria from wild desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni and O. c. mexicana) in Arizona.
AB  - Nasal, pharyngeal, cervical and vaginal swab specimens were obtained from 74 desert bighorn sheep for the purpose of investigating the normal aerobic bacterial flora of wild sheep. A total of 281 isolates was obtained and identified by standard microbiologic tests. One hundred seven of these isolates were gram positive and included Bacillus sp. (36%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8%), S. aureus (4%), Corynebacterium sp. (diphtheroids, 4%), and Streptococcus sp. (48%). gram negative isolates totaled 174 and included Neisseria sp. (18%), Citrobacter sp. (3%), Enterobacter sp. (2%), Escherichia coli (2%), Proteus sp. (2%) and non-fermentative bacilli (NFB) (73%). Of the NFB isolates, Pseudomonas sp. (25%), Acinetobacter sp. (18%), Moraxella sp. (15%) were identified.
TI  - Microbiological sampling of towels: comparison of 7 methods.
AB  - Pull-out roller towels were infected with bacteria and examined with 5 non-destructive methods. In addition to three traditional methods, the agar contact method (A), the swab method (S) and the tape method (T), two lesser known methods have been applied: the rinsing box method (R), new developed in the laboratory, and the filter method (F). In the first (R), the towel is fixed between the lid and the cup of a metal box containing a rinsing liquid; shaking the box completes the test. In the second (F) the liquid is forced through the towel by vacuum. In both experiments the rinsing liquid is tested for contamination. Destructive methods, mainly with a peristaltic blender ("stomacher") (P) or rotary mixer (M), were used as reference for calculating ratios of recovery. With the methods A, S and T, a low ratio of recovery, resp. 5, 10 and 2%, was obtained for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. With method R, ratios for the two species were 60-90%, and also for a Micrococcus species and for spores of Bacillus subtilis. With method F the ratio for E. coli and Micrococcus sp. was even slightly higher than 100%. Recovery with method M was about the same as with P. It is concluded that the rinsing box method as well as the filter method are well suited to the purpose of microbiologically testing towels; the lower recovery of the first is compensated by its simplicity.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in tonsils of children with recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  - Tonsils were obtained from 50 children suffering from recurrent tonsillitis. Patients' ages ranged from 2.5 to 17 years (mean 6 years); 29 were males and 21 females. The tonsils were sectioned in half after heat searing of the surface and the core material was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora was obtained in all patients, yielding an average of 7.8 isolates (4.1 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes) per specimen. There were 207 anaerobes isolated. The predominant isolates were 101 Bacteroides sp (including 10 B fragilis group, and 47 B melaninogenicus group), 29 Fusobacterium sp, 34 Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (25 Peptococcus sp and 9 Peptostreptococcus sp) and 16 Veillonella sp. There were 185 aerobic isolates. The predominant isolates were 41 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 24 Staphylococcus aureus, 19 beta-hemolytic streptococci (11 group A, 4 group B, and 2 each group C and F), 14 Haemophilus sp (including 12 H influenzae type B) and 5 H parainfluenzae. Beta-lactamase production was noted in 56 isolates recovered from 37 tonsils. These were all isolates of S aureus (24) and B fragilis (10), 15 of 47 B melaninogenicus (32%), 5 of the 12 B oralis (42%), and 2 of 12 H influenzae type B (17%). Our findings indicate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic nature of deep tonsillar flora in children with recurrent tonsillitis, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in 74% of the patients.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of burns in children.
AB  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of burn sites in 180 children were monitored. Specimens were obtained twice a week; each patient had between one and 21 cultures taken (mean 2.4). A total of 392 specimens were collected over 2 years, of which 319 were positive. Aerobic bacteria alone were present in 225 specimens (71%) and anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 26 (8%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were present in 68 burn specimens (21%). A total of 580 isolates (448 aerobes and 132 anaerobes) were recovered, accounting for 1.8 isolates per specimen (1.4 aerobes and 0.4 anaerobes). The predominant aerobic isolates were S. epidermidis, S. aureus, alpha hemolytic streptococcus, Pseudomonas sp., and Group D streptococcus. The predominant anaerobic isolates were: P. acnes, anaerobic Gram-positive cocci, and Bacteroides sp. Blood cultures were drawn from 45 children: four showed bacterial growth of one of each of the following isolates: S. aureus, E. coli, Peptococcus asaccharolyticus, and B. fragilis. The numbers of isolates per specimen were higher in the oral and anal area (3.2 and 2.8) than in the extremities and trunk (1.8 and 0.9). Gram-negative enteric rods and Group D streptococci were more frequently recovered from the anal area. S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and P. acnes were more frequently recovered from extremities. Bacteroides sp. and Fusobacterium nucleatum were more frequently recovered from the anal and oral areas. All children were treated with local application of silver sulfadiazine, and antimicrobial therapy was used in 128 children. Statistical analysis showed no correlation between the bacteria isolated and use of antimicrobial agents. These data suggest a role for anaerobic bacteria in the colonization of burns in children, especially in burns of the anal and oral areas.
TI  - The site of inhibition of cell wall synthesis by 3-amino-3-deoxy-D-glucose in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The inhibition of growth and cell wall synthesis by 3-amino-3-deoxy-D-glucose (3-AG), which is known to be one of the constituents of the kanamycin molecule and a metabolite of Bacillus sp., was almost completely overcome by glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine in Staphylococcus aureus but scarcely affected by D-glucose and D-fructose. The antibiotic did not inhibit the incorporation of [14C]glucosamine and [3H]N-acetylglucosamine into the acid-insoluble fraction, but rather enhanced the incorporation of [14C]glucosamine. On the other hand, it inhibited the incorporation of D-[14C]fructose into the cell wall fraction but hardly affected the incorporation of D-[14C]fructose into the acid-insoluble fraction in the presence of pencillin G. Based on these results, it is suggested that the site of primary action of 3-AG is the formation of glucosamine-6-phosphate from D-fructose-6-phosphate, which is catalyzed by glucosamine synthetase [EC 2.6.1.16].
TI  - Controlled cell disruption: a comparison of the forces required to disrupt different micro-organisms.
AB  - A cell disrupter has been developed which can measure the forces required to disrupt both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. It operates a continuous process and will disrupt both large and small volumes. Shear forces are set up when a suspension under laminar flow conditions is released under high pressure through a short orifice. If the applied pressure is altered, the shear forces are simultaneously changed so that the amount of cell disruption can be compared under different known and repeatable conditions. The disrupter is now manufactured and supplied by Stansted Fluid Power Limited, Stansted, England. Phase-contrast microscopy has shown that the disrupter will break a variety of organisms including Chlorella, Aspergillus fumigatis, Fusarium sp., Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei, Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium perfringens, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus zooepidermicus and Staphylococcus aureus. The cells are not all broken at one pressure but a certain pressure must be applied before disruption starts which will then increase rapidly as the applied pressure is increased. The applied pressure required to disrupt half the population in a culture is different from one species to another, rods being disrupted more easily than spheres. The case of disruption seems to be related to the shape and chemical composition of the cell wall. Furthermore, the disrupting process, in an unsynchronized culture is not random and may be related to the statistical size distribution of the cells.
TI  - Bacterial contamination in a modern operating suite. 4. Bacterial contamination of clothes worn in the suite.
AB  - Clean clothes in the staff dressing rooms were heavily contaminated with bacteria, mainly Bacillus sp., but Staphylococcus aureus were found on 14% and Clostridium sp. on 10% of the garments examined. A comparison of the occurrence of Staph. aureus on shirts worn by staff in wards and operating departments showed ward shirts to be contaminated more heavily and with more strains. Examination of sterile gowns worn by surgeons showed that 70% were contaminated with Staph. aureus after operation. Of the strains isolated 31% were identical with those carried by the surgeon or by the patient operated on, but for the remainder no source could be found.
TI  - Aerobic bacterial flora of oral and nasal fluids of canines with reference to bacteria associated with bites.
AB  - Oral and nasal fluids of 50 dogs were examined to determine the prevalence of aerobic bacteria frequently associated with animal bite wounds. The most frequently isolated microorganisms included: IIj, EF-4, Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, group D streptococci, Corynebacterium sp., Enterobacteria, Neisseria sp., Moraxella sp., and Bacillus sp. Other species and genera were infrequently recovered and may represent transient flora. The high incidence of IIj, EF-4, P. multocida, and S. aureus, all known human pathogens, suggests that they should be considered as probably contaminants in bite wounds.
TI  - Studies on bacterial cell wall inhibitors. III. 3-amino-3-deoxy-D-glucose, an inhibitor of bacterial cell wall synthesis.
AB  - It was shown that 3-amino-3-deoxy-D-glucose, one of the constituents of the kanamycin molecule and a metabolite of Bacillus sp., inhibits the bacterial synthesis of cell wall. The antibiotic (100 microgram/ml) significantly inhibits the growth of Staphylococcus aureus FDA 209P as well as the incorporation of DL-[14C]alanine into the acid-insoluble macromolecular fraction of its growing cells in the presence of chloramphenicol (100 microgram/ml). In contrast, the antibiotic does not affect the incorporation of [3H]thymidine, [3H]uridine and L-[14C]leucine. The other constituents of kanamycin, 6-amino-6-deoxy-D-glucose and deoxystreptamine do not inhibit the synthesis of bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan.
TI  - Bacteremia after upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.
AB  - During 24 months, 200 upper gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed on 193 patients. Blood cultures were obtained before and five and 30 minutes after the procedure using thiol (50 ml) and trypticase soy broth (100 ml) media. The mean endoscopic time was 34 minutes. Sixteen patients developed bacteremia (8%). Twelve groups of microorganisms were detected in positive blood cultures: Streptococcus (5 species), Lactobacillus sp, Veillonella alcalescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staph epidermidis, Propioni-bacterium acnes, Corynebacterium acnes, and Bacillus subtilis. Seven patients had positive blood cultures at five and 30 minutes, eight at five minutes, and one at 30 minutes only. There was no clear correlation of bacteremia with the age or previous history of the patient, biopsy, active bleeding, endoscopic time, or findings. A follow-up study of all patients for six months to two years indicated no complications related to endoscopy and/or bacteremia.
TI  - In vitro synthesis of the unit that links teichoic acid to peptidoglycan.
AB  - The role of cytidine diphosphate (CDP)-glycerol in gram-positive bacteria whose walls lack poly(glycerol phosphate) was investigated. Membrane preparations from Staphylococcus aureus H, Bacillus subtilis W23, and Micrococcus sp. 2102 catalyzed the incorporation of glycerol phosphate residues from radioactive CDP-glycerol into a water-soluble polymer. In toluenized cells of Micrococcus sp. 2102, some of this product became linked to the wall. In each case, maximum incorporation of glycerol phosphate residues required the presence of the nucleotide precursors of wall teichoic acid and of uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine. In membrane preparations capable of synthesizing peptidoglycan, vancomycin caused a decrease in the incorporation of isotope from CDP-glycerol into polymer. Synthesis of the poly (glycerol phosphate) unit thus depended at an early stage on the concomitant synthesis of wall teichoic acid and later on the synthesis of peptidoglycan. It is concluded that CDP-glycerol is the biosynthetic precursor of the tri(glycerol phosphate) linkage unit between teichoic acid and peptidoglycan that has recently been characterized in S. aureus H.
TI  - Mode of action of glycine on the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan.
AB  - The mechanism of glycine action in growth inhibition was studied on eight different species of bacteria of various genera representing the four most common peptidoglycan types. To inhibit the growth of the different organisms to 80%, glycine concentrations from 0.05 to 1.33 M had to be applied. The inhibited cells showed morphological aberrations. It has been demonstrated that glycine is incorporated into the nucleotide-activated peptidoglycan precursors. The amount of incorporated glycine was equivalent to the decrease in the amount of alanine. With one exception glycine is also incorporated into the peptidoglycan. Studies on the primary structure of both the peptidoglycan precursors and the corresponding peptidoglycan have revealed that glycine can replace l-alanine in position 1 and d-alanine residues in positions 4 and 5 of the peptide subunit. Replacement of l-alanine in position 1 of the peptide subunit together with an accumulation of uridine diphosphate-muramic acid (UDP-MurNAc), indicating an inhibition of the UDP-MurNAc:l-Ala ligase, has been found in three bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus cellobiosus and L. plantarum). However, discrimination against precursors with glycine in position 1 in peptidoglycan synthesis has been observed only in S. aureus. Replacement of d-alanine residues was most common. It occurred in the peptidoglycan with one exception in all strains studied. In Corynebacterium sp., C. callunae, L. plantarum, and L. cellobiosus most of the d-alanine replacing glycine occurs C-terminal in position 4, and in C. insidiosum and S. aureus glycine is found C-terminal in position 5. It is suggested that the modified peptidoglycan precursors are accumulated by being poor substrates for some of the enzymes involved in peptidoglycan synthesis. Two mechanisms leading to a more loosely cross-linked peptidoglycan and to morphological changes of the cells are considered. First, the accumulation of glycine-containing precursors may lead to a disrupture of the normal balance between peptidoglycan synthesis and controlled enzymatic hydrolysis during growth. Second, the modified glycine-containing precursors may be incorporated. Since these are poor substrates in the transpeptidation reaction, a high percentage of muropeptides remains uncross-linked. The second mechanism may be the more significant in most cases.
TI  - Bactericidal properties of the concentrated artificial kidney bath solution.
AB  - This study was undertaken to investigate the ability of a 30 times concentrated dialysate fluid to support or inhibit growth of bacteria, and to evaluate its shelf life. The solution was inoculated with the following organisms in the logarithmic-growth phase: Escherichia coli, coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus, enteric Streptococcus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Klebsiella-Aerobacter sp., Proteus sp., and Bacillus subtilis. Inoculated concentrate held at 37 C showed an exponential decrease in organisms for all species except B. subtilis, with no organisms recoverable at 24 hr. To determine the effects of temperature, solution inoculated with E. coli and S. aureus was kept at 4 and 20 C. Lesser rates of bacterial decline were found at the lower temperatures, with some organisms surviving for 146 hr at 4 C. For the evaluation of shelf life, 2 liters of the solution was kept at room temperature in screw-cap bottles for 8 months; no bacterial growth occurred. The self-sterilizing property of this solution is important practically, since it removes another source of contamination from patients with reduced resistance to infection due to chronic renal disease or immunosuppressive therapy for renal homotransplantation.
TI  - Repression of Staphylococcus aureus by food bacteria. II. Causes of inhibition.
AB  - Two food bacteria, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas sp. CS-1, inhibited an enterotoxigenic strain of Staphylococcus aureus, apparently by out-competing it for nutrients. Five others, Bacillus cereus, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli H-52, Aerobacter aerogenes, and Achromobacter sp., inhibited by means of antibiotic substances which were Seitz-filterable, dialyzable, and stable at 90 C for 10 min. Inhibition was not caused by changes in pH, oxidation-reduction potential, or production of peroxide or fatty acids. The concentrated antibiotic material from E. coli H-52 contained amino acids but not peptides and was especially effective against staphylococci and micrococci.
