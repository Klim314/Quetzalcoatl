TI  == effect of in-feed administration and withdrawal of tylosin phosphate on antibiotic resistance in enterococci isolated from feedlot steers.
AB  == tylosin phosphate is a macrolide commonly administered to cattle in north america for the control of liver abscesses. this study investigated the effect of in-feed administration of tylosin phosphate to cattle at subtherapeutic levels and its subsequent withdrawal on macrolide resistance using enterococci as an indicator bacterium. fecal samples were collected from steers that received no antibiotics  and steers administered tylosin phosphate (11 ppm) in-feed for 197 days and withdrawn 28 days before slaughter. enterococcus species isolated from fecal samples were identified through sequencing the groes-el intergenic spacer region  and subject to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, identification of resistance determinants and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiling. tylosin increased (p < 0.05) the proportion of ery(r) and tyl(r) enterococci within the population. just prior to its removal, the proportion of ery(r) and tyl(r) resistant enterococci began decreasing and continued to decrease after tylosin was withdrawn from the diet until there was no difference (p > 0.05) between treatments on d 225. this suggests that antibiotic withdrawal prior to slaughter  contributes to a reduction in the proportion of macrolide resistant enterococci entering the food chain. among the 504 enterococci isolates characterized, enterococcus hirae was found to predominate (n = 431), followed by enterococcus villorum (n = 32), enterococcus faecium (n = 21), enterococcus durans (n = 7), enterococcus casseliflavus (n = 4), enterococcus mundtii (n = 4), enterococcus gallinarum (n = 3), enterococcus faecalis (n = 1), and enterococcus thailandicus  (n = 1). the diversity of enterococci was greater in steers at arrival than at exit from the feedlot. erythromycin resistant isolates harbored the erm(b) and/or msrc gene. similar pfge profiles of ery(r) e. hirae pre- and post-antibiotic treatment suggest that increased abundance of ery(r) enterococci after administration of tylosin phosphate reflects selection for strains that were already present within the gastrointestinal tract of cattle at arrival.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance profile of enterococcus species isolated from intestinal tracts of hospitalized patients in jimma, ethiopia.
AB  == background: multi-drug-resistant enterococci colonizing the intestinal tract of hospitalized patients are the major source of infection as well as nosocomial spread. despite worldwide increasing rate of multidrug resistant enterococci colonization and infection among hospitalized patients, there is scarcity of data from resource limited setting. the present study aimed at determining the antimicrobial resistance profile of enterococcus species from intestinal tracts of hospitalized patients in jimma, ethiopia. methods: the study was conducted among hospitalized patients at jimma university specialized hospital, from january to july 2013. fecal samples were collected and processed for bacterial isolation and susceptibility testing to antimicrobial agents. stool samples were  inoculated onto enterococcus selective media (bile esculin azide agar plate) with and without 6 microg/ml of vancomycin. the isolates were identified to genus and  species level by cultural characteristics, gram's stain, catalase test, growth in 6.5% nacl broth, growth at 45 degrees c, motility test and by using api 20 streptococcus system. sensitivity testing was done using kirby-bauer disk diffusion method. minimum inhibitory concentrations for vancomycin were determined using e-test strips. result: overall, enterococci were isolated from 114 (76%) of the study subjects. the isolates were enterococcus faecium (35.1%) followed by enterococcus faecalis (29.8%), enterococcus gallinarum (17.5%), enterococcus casseliflavus (8.8%) and enterococcus durans (8.8%). among 114 tested enterococci isolates, 41 (36%) were resistant to ampicillin, 62 (54.4%) to streptomycin and 39 (34.2%) to gentamycin. other alternative antibiotics to treat mixed nosocomial infection caused by enterococci also showed high rate of resistance in vitro: ciprofloxacin (50% of resistance), norfloxacin (49.1%), erythromycin (63.2%), tetracycline (64.9%), chloramphenicol (34.2%), and nitrofrantoin (32.4%). multiple drug resistance was observed among 89.5% of e. faecium and e. faecalis. vancomycin resistant enterococci were observed in 5% of  e. faecium isolates. conclusion: this study reveals high rate of fecal colonization by multidrug-resistant enterococci and prevalence of vancomycin resistance strains. thus periodic surveillance of antibacterial susceptibilities  is recommended to detect emerging resistance and to prevent the spread of antibacterial-resistant strains.

TI  == diversity of enterococcal species and characterization of high-level aminoglycoside resistant enterococci of samples of wastewater and surface water in tunisia.
AB  == one hundred-fourteen samples of wastewater (n=64) and surface-water (n=50) were inoculated in slanetz-bartley agar plates supplemented or not with gentamicin (sb-gen and sb plates, respectively) for enterococci recovery. enterococci were obtained from 75% of tested samples in sb media (72% in wastewater; 78% in surface-water), and 85 enterococcal isolates (one/positive-sample) were obtained. enterococcus faecium was the most prevalent species (63.5%), followed by enterococcus faecalis (20%), enterococcus hirae (9.4%), enterococcus casseliflavus (4.7%), and enterococcus gallinarum/enterococcus durans (2.4%). antibiotic resistance detected among these enterococci was as follows [percentage/detected gene (number isolates)]: kanamycin [29%/aph(3')-iiia (n=22)], streptomycin [8%/ant(6)-ia (n=4)], erythromycin [44%/erm(b) (n=34)], tetracycline [18%/tet(m) (n=6)/tet(m)-tet(l) (n=9)], chloramphenicol [2%/cat(a) (n=1)], ciprofloxacin [7%] and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [94%]. high-level-gentamicin resistant (hlr-g) enterococci were recovered from 15 samples in sb-gen or sb plates [12/64 samples of wastewater (19%) and 3/50 samples of surface-water (6%)]; hlr-g isolates were identified as e. faecium (n=7), e. faecalis (n=6), and e. casseliflavus (n=2). these hlr-g enterococci carried the aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia and erm(b) genes, in addition to aph(3')-iiia  (n=10), ant(6)-ia (n=9), tet(m) (n=13), tet(l) (n=8) and cat(a) genes (n=2). three hlr-g enterococci carried the esp virulence gene. sequence-types detected among hlr-g enterococci were as follows: e. faecalis (st480, st314, st202, st55,  and the new ones st531 and st532) and e. faecium (st327, st12, st296, and the new ones st985 and st986). thirty-two different pfge patterns were detected among 36  high-level-aminoglycoside-resistant enterococci recovered in water samples. diverse genetic lineages of hlr-g enterococci were detected in wastewater and surface-water in tunisia. water can represent an important source for the dissemination of these antibiotic resistant microorganisms to other environments.

TI  == prevalence, antimicrobial resistance and genetic lineages of enterococcus spp from vegetable food, soil and irrigation water in farm environments in tunisia.
AB  == background: the objective was to determine the species, clonal diversity, antibiotic resistance and virulence in enterococci of different environments. seventy-one samples of farm origin (34 of food-vegetables, 27 of soil and 10 of irrigation water), and 19 samples of vegetables of 5 markets were inoculated in slanetz-bartley agar plates supplemented or not with gentamicin (sb-gen and sb plates, respectively) for enterococci recovery. results: enterococci were obtained from 72.2% of tested samples in sb media (food-vegetables from farm, 88.2%; soil and irrigation water, 51%; food-vegetables from market, 84.2%), and 65 enterococcal isolates were obtained. e. faecium was the most prevalent species (52.3%), followed by e. hirae (35.4%), e. faecalis (6.15%), and e. casseliflavus  (6.15%). antibiotic resistance detected among these enterococci were [percentage/detected gene]: ciprofloxacin [60%], erythromycin [18.4%/erm(b)], tetracycline [15.4%/tet(m)-tet(l)], kanamycin [15.4%/aph(3')-iii], chloramphenicol [7.7%], streptomycin [3%/ant(6)], vancomycin [6.15%/vanc2)], and  teicoplanin and ampicillin [0%]. high-level-gentamicin resistant (hlr-g) enterococci were detected in sb-gen plates in 14 of 90 tested samples (15.5%), and 15 isolates were characterized: 10 e. faecalis, 4 e. faecium and 1 e. hirae.  all hlr-g enterococci carried the aac(6')-aph(2"), erm(b) and tet(m) genes, among other resistance genes. the hlr-g isolates showed high genetic diversity (10 different pfge-profiles), and were ascribed to the sequence-types: e. faecalis (st2, st16, st28, and the new st528); e. faecium (st56, st885, and st886). conclusion: food-vegetables at the farm or market setting are frequently contaminated by hlr-g enterococci and these microorganisms could reach the human  intestine through the food chain, if hygienic conditions are not followed.

TI  == occurrence and antimicrobial resistance of enterococci isolated from organic and  conventional retail chicken.
AB  == antibiotic-resistant bacteria existing in agricultural environments may be transferred to humans through food consumption or more multifaceted environmental paths of exposure. notably, enterococcal infections are becoming more challenging to treat as their resistance to antibiotics intensifies. in this study, the prevalence and antibiotic resistance profiles of enterococci in organic and conventional chicken from retail stores were analyzed. of the total 343 retail chicken samples evaluated, 282 (82.2%) were contaminated with enterococcus spp. the prevalence was higher in organic chicken (62.5%) than conventional chicken (37.5%). enterococcus isolates were submitted to susceptibility tests against 12  antimicrobial agents. among the isolates tested, streptomycin had the highest frequencies of resistance (69.1 and 100%) followed by erythromycin (38.5 and 80.0%), penicillin (14.1 and 88.5%), and kanamycin (11.3 and 76.9%) for organic and conventional isolates, respectively. chloramphenicol had the lowest frequency (0.0 and 6.6%, respectively). the predominant species in raw chicken was e. faecium (27.3%), followed by e. gallinarum (6.0%), e. casseliflavus (2.1%), and e. durans (1.4%). these species were also found to be resistant to three or more  antibiotics. the data indicated that antibiotic-resistant enterococci isolates were found in chicken whether it was organic or conventional. however, enterococci isolates that were resistant to antibiotics were less common in organic chicken (31.0%) when compared with those isolated from conventional chicken (43.6%). the results of this study suggest that raw retail organic and conventional chickens could be a source of antibiotic-resistant enterococci.

TI  == detection of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis st6-vanb2 and e. faecium  st915-vana in faecal samples of wild rattus rattus in spain.
AB  == the detection of vancomycin-resistant-enterococci (vre) among wild animals represents a worrisome public health concern. the objectives of the study were to determine the possible presence of vre in faecal samples of wild small mammals in spain, to characterize the vancomycin resistance mechanisms and genetic lineages  of recovered isolates and to know the diversity of enterococcal species in these  animals. a total of 155 faecal samples from small mammals were inoculated in slanetz-bartley agar supplemented or not with vancomycin (van-sb/sb plates). the  antimicrobial susceptibility profile to 12 antimicrobials and the presence of 20  antimicrobial resistance genes was analyzed. the structure of tn1546 and the presence of gele, cyla, asa, esp and hyl genes was studied. multilocus-sequence-typing (mlst) technique was also performed. vre isolates were recovered in van-sb plates in 11 samples. two samples contained vanb2-positive e. faecalis isolates of lineage st6, which showed a multiresistance phenotype and harboured the virulence genes gele and asa. one sample contained a vancomycin-resistant e. faecium isolate of the new lineage st915, with the vana gene included into tn1546 (truncated with is1542 and is1216 elements). the vanb2  and vana isolates were obtained from rattus rattus. the remaining eight vre-positive samples contained species with intrinsic vancomycin-resistance mechanisms: e. casseliflavus (n=5) and e. gallinarum (n=3). one hundred and forty-seven vancomycin-susceptible-enterococcal isolates were obtained in sb plates, and e. faecalis and e. faecium were the most frequent detected species. this is the first report of vanb2-containing enterococci in wild animals.

TI  == modified 16s-23s rrna intergenic region restriction endonuclease analysis for species identification of enterococcus strains isolated from pigs, compared with  identification using classical methods and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == fast and reliable identification of bacteria to at least the species level is currently the basis for correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment of infections. this is particularly important in the case of bacteria of the genus enterococcus, whose resistance profile is often correlated with their species (e.g. resistance to vancomycin). in this study, we evaluated restriction endonuclease analysis of the 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic transcribed spacer (its) region for species identification of enterococcus. the utility of the method was compared with that of phenotypic methods [biochemical profile evaluation and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms)]. identification was based on 21 enterococcus reference strains, of the species e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. hirae, e. durans, e. casseliflavus, e. gallinarum, e. avium, e. cecorum and e. columbae, and 47 enterococcus field strains isolated from pigs. restriction endonuclease analysis  of the its-pcr product using hinfi, rsai and mboi, in the order specified, enabled species differentiation of the enterococcus reference and field strains,  and in the case of the latter, the results of species identification were identical (47/47) to those obtained by maldi-tof ms. moreover, as a result of digestion with mboi, a unique restriction profile was also obtained for the strains (3/3) identified by maldi-tof ms as e. thailandicus. in our opinion, restriction endonuclease analysis of the 16s-23s rrna gene its region of enterococcus may be a simple and relatively fast (less than 4 h) alternative method for identifying the species occurring most frequently in humans and animals.

TI  == identification of enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis as vanc-type vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) from sewage and river water in the provincial city of miyazaki, japan.
AB  == as a first step for assessing the risk to human health posed by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) in the aquatic environment, we screened sewage and urban river water samples from miyazaki, japan for vre. because vancomycin-resistant organisms are not as prevalent in sewage and river water as  vancomycin-susceptible organisms, the samples were screened by minimum inhibitory concentration test using the vancomycin-supplemented membrane-enterococcus indoxyl-beta-d-glucoside (mei) agar. the isolates, presumed to be enterococci, were identified using 16s rrna sequencing analysis. the percentages of vre isolates screened using 4 mug ml(-1) vancomycin-supplemented mei agar from sewage and urban river water samples were 12% and 24%, respectively. the vancomycin-resistant genes vanc1 and vanc2/3 were detected in the isolates from both samples by pcr analysis. all enterococci isolates containing vanc1, which is a specific gene for vanc-type of vre, were identified as enterococcus casseliflavus/gallinarum. further, 92% enterococci isolates containing vanc2/3 were identified as e. casseliflavus/gallinarum, the remaining isolates containing vanc2/3 were e. faecium (4%) and e. faecalis (4%). thereafter, the distribution of e. faecium and e. faecalis, which are the major types of enterococci in humans containing vanc2/3, was observed in the water samples collected.

TI  == enterococcus--virulence and susceptibility to photodynamic therapy of clinical isolates from lower silesia, poland.
AB  == background: a collection of 400 enterococcal isolates from clinical samples of hospitalized patients were studied for their virulence traits according to the isolation site. formation of biofilm and production of dnase, hemolysin, lipase,  and gelatinase were characterized. biofilms of selected strains were examined for their susceptibility to antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt). methods: all strains were tested for biofilm production by microtiter method and the activity  of hemolysin, gelatinase, lipase, and dnase by plate method with an adequate substrate. photodynamic therapy with photolon and red laser light was performed towards 48 h biofilms of eight representative strains. the viability of biofilms  was tested by the bactlight assay and visualized under a fluorescent microscope.  results: among the 400 isolates, 69.8% strains of enterococcus faecalis, 30% of enterococcus faecium, and 0.2% of enterococcus casseliflavus were identified. in  vitro, production of biofilm was found in 65.7% of enterococci. biofilm-positive  strains were isolated from urinary tract infections (81%), wound infections (71%), respiratory tract infections (62%), and gastrointestinal tract (47%) (colonization). hemolysin activity was observed in 28.5%, gelatinase in 24.5%, lipase in 23%, and dnase in 3.5% of all, mostly biofilm-positive, isolates. photodynamic therapy with photolon efficiently reduced the enterococcal biofilms. conclusions: the study demonstrated the high prevalence of biofilm-producing clinical enterococci, their virulence potential being higher than for biofilm-negative strains, and the susceptibility to apdt of mature biofilms produced by strains, regardless of their species and site of isolation.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococcal species isolated from antibiotic-treated dogs and cats.
AB  == in this study, we examined the antimicrobial susceptibility of the enterococci isolated from dogs and cats in japan during 2011-2012. fecal samples were collected from 84 dogs and 16 cats that underwent antibiotic treatment. enterococci were detected in 70 of 84 dogs (83.3%) and 7 of 16 cats (43.8%). the  most prevalent enterococcus species was enterococcus faecalis (64.9%); enterococcus faecium and enterococcus durans were also isolated from 14 of 77 (18.2%) and 5 of 77 (6.5%) of these animals, respectively. the most active resistance was observed for erythromycin (44.2%) and oxytetracycline (44.2%), and there was considerable resistance to lincomycin (41.6%), gentamicin (31.2%) and kanamycin (31.2%). compared with the results of a similar study conducted in 2006 and 2007, enterococci susceptibility to enrofloxacin and ampicillin had significantly increased. enterococcus gallinarum harboring vanc1 and enterococcus casseliflavus harboring vanc2/3 were isolated from 4 of 77 enterococcal isolates. however, no enterococcal isolates were resistant to vancomycin. multidrug resistance was found for as few as two and as many as nine antimicrobials regardless of the class. these results demonstrate that dogs and cats treated with antibiotics are commonly colonized with antimicrobial-resistant enterococci.

TI  == maldi-tof identification of the human gut microbiome in people with and without diarrhea in senegal.
AB  == background: in africa, there are several problems with the specific identification of bacteria. recently, maldi-tof mass spectrometry has become a powerful tool for the routine microbial identification in many clinical laboratories. methodology/principal findings: this study was conducted using feces from 347 individuals (162 with diarrhea and 185 without diarrhea) sampled in health centers in dakar, senegal. feces were transported from dakar to marseille, france, where they were cultured using different culture conditions. the isolated colonies were identified using maldi-tof. if a colony was unidentified, 16s rrna sequencing was performed. overall, 2,753 isolates were tested, allowing for the identification of 189 bacteria from 5 phyla, including 2 previously unknown species, 11 species not previously reported in the human gut,  10 species not previously reported in humans, and 3 fungi. 2,718 bacterial isolates (98.8%) out of 2,750 yielded an accurate identification using mass spectrometry, as did the 3 candida albicans isolates. thirty-two bacterial isolates not identified by maldi-tof (1.2%) were identified by sequencing, allowing for the identification of 2 new species. the number of bacterial species per fecal sample was significantly higher among patients without diarrhea (8.6+/-3) than in those with diarrhea (7.3+/-3.4; p = 0.0003). a modification of  the gut microbiota was observed between the two groups. in individuals with diarrhea, major commensal bacterial species such as e. coli were significantly decreased (85% versus 64%), as were several enterococcus spp. (e. faecium and e.  casseliflavus) and anaerobes, such as bacteroides spp. (b. uniformis and b. vulgatus) and clostridium spp. (c. bifermentans, c. orbiscindens, c. perfringens, and c. symbosium). conversely, several bacillus spp. (b. licheniformis, b. mojavensis, and b. pumilus) were significantly more frequent among patients with  diarrhea. conclusions/significance: maldi-tof is a potentially powerful tool for  routine bacterial identification in africa, allowing for a quick identification of bacterial species.

TI  == prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of enterococcus species: a hospital-based study in china.
AB  == objective: to investigate the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of enterococcus species isolated from a university hospital, and explore the mechanisms underlying the antimicrobial resistance, so as to provide clinical evidence for the inappropriate clinical use of antimicrobial agents and the control and prevention of enterococcal infections. methods: a total of 1,157 enterococcal strains isolated from various clinical specimens from january 2010 to december 2012 in the general hospital of ningxia medical university were identified to species level with a vitek-2 compact fully automated microbiological system, and the antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococcus species was determined using the kirby-bauer disc diffusion method. the multiple-drug resistant enterococcal isolates were screened from the clinical isolates of enterococcus species from the burns department. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of enterococcus species to the three fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin was determined with the agar dilution method, and the changes in the mic of enterococcus species to the three fluoroquinolones following reserpine treatment  were evaluated. the beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, tetracycline, macrolide, glycopeptide resistance genes and the efflux pump emea genes were detected in the enterococcal isolates using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay. results: the 1,157 clinical isolates of enterococcus species included 679 e. faecium isolates  (58.7%), 382 e. faecalis isolates (33%), 26 e. casseliflavus isolates (2.2%), 24  e. avium isolates (2.1%), and 46 isolates of other enterococcus species (4%). the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance varied significantly between e. faecium and e. faecalis, and </= 1.1% of these two enterococcus species were found to be  resistant to vancomycin, teicoplanin or linezolid. in addition, the enterococcus  species isolated from different departments of the hospital exhibited various resistances to the same antimicrobial agent, while reserpine treatment reduced the resistance of enterococcus species to ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin. the beta-lactamase gene tem, aminoglycoside-modifying-enzyme genes  aac(6')-aph(2"), aph(3')-iii, ant(6)-i and ant(2")-i, tetracycline resistance gene tetm, erythromycin resistance gene ermb, vancomycin resistance gene vana and the enterococcal multidrug resistance efflux emea gene were detected in 77%, 62%, 26%, 13%, 36%, 31%, 66%, 5% and 55% of the 100 multiple-drug resistant enterococcal isolates. conclusions: similar to previous findings, e. faecium and  e. faecalis are predominant conditionally pathogenic bacteria that cause hospital-acquired infections that can cause urinary and respiratory system infections. multiple and high-level antimicrobial resistance is highly prevalent  in the hospital isolates of enterococcus species. reserpine treatment inhibits the active efflux of enterococcus species to ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin in vitro and reduces the mic of enterococcus species to these three  fluoroquinolones. the presence of the enterococcal multidrug resistance efflux emea gene is associated with the resistance to antibiotics in enterococcus species. the monitoring of the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of enterococcus species is of great significance to guide the control and prevention of enterococcal infections.

TI  == enterococcal disease, epidemiology, and implications for treatment
AB  == during the past few decades, enterococci have emerged as important healthcare-associated pathogens (arias & murray, 2012; austin, bonten, weinstein, slaughter, & anderson, 1999; boyce, et al., 1994; benenson, et al., 2009; goossens, 1998; handwerger, et al., 1993). the continuing progress of modern medical care toward more intensive and invasive medical therapies for human disease has undoubtedly contributed to the increased prevalence of these remarkable opportunistic pathogens. this trend has also been attributed to the increasing antibiotic resistance among clinical isolates of enterococci. the rapid spread of enterococci with resistance to vancomycin (vre) has been of particular concern. many healthcare-associated strains that are resistant to vancomycin also show resistance to penicillin, as well as high-level resistance (hlr) to aminoglycosides. finally, as has historically been the case with enterococci, resistance is emerging to newer agents used to treat vre infections, such as linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, and daptomycin (chow, donahedian, & zervos, 1997; herrero, issa, & patel, 2002; sabol, patterson, lewis ii, aaron, cadena, & jorgensen, 2005). over the past two decades, enterococcus faecium has emerged as a leading cause of multidrug-resistant enterococcal infection in the united states (hidron, et al., 2008). e. faecium is intrinsically more antibiotic-resistant than e. faecalis, with more than half of its pathogenic isolates expressing resistance to vancomycin, ampicillin, and high-levels of aminoglycosides. treating infections caused by this species can be difficult, and the magnitude of the problem is vast. approximately 40% of medical intensive care units in a recent national healthcare safety network report found that the majority of device-associated infections (namely, infections due to central lines, urinary drainage catheters, and ventilators) were due to vancomycin- and ampicillin-resistant e. faecium (80% and 90.4%, respectively) (hidron, et al., 2008). although they were often resistant to high-level aminoglycosides and some  macrolides, healthcare-associated infections in these units due to e. faecalis remained largely susceptible to vancomycin and ampicillin (93.1% and 96.2%, respectively) for reasons that are not entirely known. other enterococcal species are rarer causes of human infection, including e. durans, e. avium, e. casseliflavus, e. hirae, e. gallinarum, e. raffinosus, and e. muntdii (gordon, et al., 1992). in the following sections, the common human infections caused by enterococci are briefly described. the epidemiology of antibiotic-resistant enterococci in healthcare settings is summarized, including the role of colonization pressure and host factors on the emergence of vre in clinical settings. finally, the current challenges facing clinicians who treat antibiotic-resistant enterococcal infections are reviewed.

AB  == enterococci are found in high concentrations in human feces, usually between 104  and 106 bacteria per gram wet weight (layton, walters, lam, & boehm, 2010; slanetz & bartley, 1957; zubrzycki & spaulding, 1962); see also enterococcus diversity, origins in nature, and gut colonization). although enterococci usually represent less than 1% of the flora (tendolkar, baghdayan, & shankar, 2003), they are usually present in the fecal consortium, but are outnumbered by other bacteria, including escherichia coli, clostridia, and the bacteroidales (zubrzycki & spaulding, 1962). due to their ubiquity in human feces and persistence in the environment, enterococci have been adopted as indicators of human fecal pollution in water. more recently, their densities on human hands have been used as indicators of hand hygiene. the use of enterococci as indicators of human fecal pollution or contamination can be problematic, however, because enterococci are also found in animal feces (harwood, whitlock, & withington, 2000; layton, walters, lam, & boehm, 2010), in soils (byappanahalli & fujioka, 2004; goto & yan, 2011), and on plants (byappanahalli, shively, nevers,  sadowsky, & whitman, 2003; imamura, thompson, boehm, & jay, 2011; muller, ulrich, ott, & muller, 2001). although there is debate about the extent to which this happens in nature, there is evidence that enterococci are capable of replicating  in extra-enteric environments, such as on beach sands (bahirathan, puente, & seyfried, 1998; zubrzycki & spaulding, 1962) and in water containing kelp (byappanahalli, shively, nevers, sadowsky, & whitman, 2003; imamura, thompson, boehm, & jay, 2011) and plankton (mote, turner, & lipp, 2012). identification of  human-specific enterococcal species or genotypes could aid in the discrimination  of human fecal contamination from other environmental sources of the organisms. some data suggest that enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis may be more prevalent in human feces than other enterococcal species, while enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus mundtii may be more abundant in environmental reservoirs (such as on plants) than other species (bahirathan, puente, & seyfried, 1998; ferguson, moore, getrich, & zhowandai, 2005; wheeler, hartel, godfrey, hill, & segars, 2002). however, a number of species of enterococcus have been isolated from human feces (layton, walters, lam, & boehm, 2010); enterococcus diversity, origins in nature, and gut colonization), so it will be difficult to derive a single host-specific indicator. it has been suggested that  e. faecium that contains the enterococcal surface protein (esp) gene may be human-specific (scott, jenkins, lukasik, & rose, 2005), but esp-containing e. faecium can also be found in select animal hosts (layton, walters, & boehm, 2009; whitman, przybyla-kelly, shively, & byappanahalli, 2007). fecal enterococci from  the gi tract consortia of healthy humans are generally not virulent. nevertheless, multidrug-resistant enterococcus strains have emerged as leading causes of hospital-acquired infections (tendolkar, baghdayan, & shankar, 2003). vancomycin-resistant enterococci are particularly important pathogens (willems, et al., 2005), as are esp-containing e. faecalis (shankar, baghdayan, huycke, lindahl, & gilmore, 1999) and e. faecium (willems, et al., 2001), as well as other types of e. faecalis and e. faecium (wisplinghoff, bischoff, tallent, seifert, wenzel, & edmond, 2004). it is estimated that there are 800,000 cases of enterococcal infection in the us each year, adding $500,000,000 to annual healthcare costs (tendolkar, baghdayan, & shankar, 2003). therefore, the presence of enterococci in the environment and on hands may have important direct health implications.

TI  == drug-resistant and hospital-associated enterococcus faecium from wastewater, riverine estuary and anthropogenically impacted marine catchment basin.
AB  == background: enterococci, ubiquitous colonizers of humans and other animals, play  an increasingly important role in health-care associated infections (hais). it is believed that the recent evolution of two clinically relevant species, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium occurred in a big part in a hospital environment, leading to formation of high-risk enterococcal clonal complexes (hireccs), which combine multidrug resistance with increased pathogenicity and epidemicity. the aim of this study was to establish the species composition in wastewater, its marine recipient as well as a river estuary and to investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility of collected isolates. molecular methods were additionally applied to test the presence of hirrecc-related e. faecium. results: two wastewater treatment plants (wwtps), their marine outfalls  and vistula river that influence significantly the quality of waters in gulf of gdansk were sampled to investigate the presence of enterococcus spp. four-hundred-twenty-eight isolates were obtained, including e. faecium (244 isolates, 57.0%), e. hirae (113 isolates, 26.4%) and e. faecalis (63 isolates, 14.7%); other species (e. gallinarum/casseliflavus, e. durans and e. avium) accounted for 1.9%. antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed the presence of isolates resistant to erythromycin, tetracycline, amipicillin, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides (high-level resistance), especially among e. faecium, where such isolates were usually characterized by multilocus sequence types associated  with nosocomial lineages 17, 18 and 78 of this species representing hirecc, formerly called cc17. these isolates not only carried several resistance determinants but were also enriched in genes encoding pathogenicity factors (esp, pili) and genes associated with mobile genetic elements (mge), a feature also typical for nosocomial hirecc. conclusions: our data show that wwtps constitute an important source of enterococcal strains carrying antimicrobial resistance determinants, often associated with the presence of mge, for the recipient water  environment, thus increasing a pool of such genes for other organisms. the presence of hireccs in wastewaters and marine/river environment may indicate that adaptations gained in hospitals may be also beneficial for survival of such clones in other settings. there is an obvious need to monitor the release and spread of such strains in order to elucidate better ways to curb their dissemination.

TI  == significance and survival of enterococci during the house fly development.
AB  == house flies are among the most important nonbiting insect pests of medical and veterinary importance. larvae develop in decaying organic substrates and their survival strictly depends on an active microbial community. house flies have been implicated in the ecology and transmission of enterococci, including multi-antibiotic-resistant and virulent strains of enterococcus faecalis. in this study, eight american type culture collection type strains of enterococci including enterococcus avium, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus durans, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcusfaecalis, and enterococcusfaecium were evaluated for their significance in the development of house flies from eggs to adults in bacterial feeding assays. furthermore, the bacterial colonization of the gut of teneral flies as well as the importance of several virulence traits of e. faecalis in larval mortality was assessed. overall survival of house flies (egg to adult) was significantly higher when grown with typically nonpathogenic enterococcal species such as e. hirae (76.0% survival), e. durans (64.0%), and e. avium (64.0%) compared with that with clinically important species e. faecalis (24.0%) and e. faecium (36.0%). however, no significant differences in survival of house fly larvae were detected when grown with e. faecalis strains carrying various virulence traits, including isogenic mutants of the human clinical isolate e. faecalis v583 with in-frame deletions of gelatinase, serine protease, and capsular polysaccharide serotype c. enterococci were commonly detected in fly puparia (range: 75-100%; concentration: 103-105 cfu/puparium);however, the prevalence of enterococci in teneral flies varied greatly: from 25.0 (e. casseliflavus) to 89.5% (e. hirae). in conclusion, depending on the species, enterococci variably support house fly larval development and colonize the gut of teneral adults. the human pathogenic species, e. faecalis and e. faecium, poorly  support larval development and are likely acquired in nature by adult flies during feeding. house fly larvae do not appear to be a suitable model organism for assessment of enterococcal virulence traits.

TI  == vana-containing e. faecium isolates of clonal complex cc17 in clinical and environmental samples in a tunisian hospital.
AB  == twenty-eight vancomycin (va)-resistant enterococci isolated from different patients (n = 16) and also from the environment (n = 12) were recovered in a tunisian military hospital during 2012-2013. the mechanisms of resistance to va and to other antibiotics as well as the presence of esp and hyl virulence genes were determined in these isolates by pcr, being their clonal relationship analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). va resistance mechanisms detected were as follows (species-patient/environment): vana (enterococcus faecium, 13/5), vanc1 (enterococcus gallinarum, 3/0), and vanc2 (enterococcus casseliflavus, 0/7). most of the va-resistant enterococci presented a multiresistance phenotype and harbored different resistance genes (erm(b), tet(m), tet(l), ant(6)-ia, aac(6')-aph(2"), aph(3')-iiia, and cata). the pfge revealed the presence of 3 clones (a, b, c) and 1 closely related pattern (a1) among the 13 vana-containing e. faecium isolates of patients showing 11 of them the a-a1 patterns. the clone a was also detected in all 5 environmental vana-containing e. faecium isolates. strains did not contain esp or hyl virulence genes. multilocus sequence typing was performed in 4 e. faecium isolates representative of the 4 detected pulsotypes (a, a1, b, and c), and 2 different sequence types were identified (st18 and st80), both of them included in clonal complex cc17. these strains contained the is16 element and showed ampicillin and  ciprofloxacin resistance. va resistance could be an emerging problem in tunisia,  and this is one of the first cases described so far in this country.

TI  == prevalence of enterococcus species and their virulence genes in fresh water prior to and after storm events.
AB  == enterococcus spp. isolates (n = 286) collected from six surface water bodies in subtropical brisbane, australia, prior to and after storm events, were identified to species level and tested for the presence of seven clinically important virulence genes (vgs). enterococcus faecalis (48%), enterococcus faecium (14%), enterococcus mundtii (13%), and enterococcus casseliflavus (13%) were frequently  detected at all sites. the frequency of e. faecium occurrence increased from 6% in the dry period to 18% after the wet period. the endocarditis antigen (efaa), gelatinase (gele), collagen-binding protein (ace), and aggregation substance (asa1) were detected in 61%, 43%, 43%, and 23% of enterococcus isolates, respectively. the chances of occurrence of ace, gele, efaa, and asa1 genes in e.  faecalis were found to be much higher compared to the other enterococcus spp. the observed odds ratio of occurrence of ace and gele genes in e. faecalis was much higher at 7.96 and 6.40 times, respectively. the hyl gene was 3.84 times more likely to be detected in e. casseliflavus. the presence of multiple vgs in most of the e. faecalis isolates underscores the importance of e. faecalis as a reservoir of vgs in the fresh water aquatic environment. consequently, if contaminated surface water is to be used for production of potable and nonpotable water some degree of treatment depending upon intended use such as detention in basins prior to use or chlorination is required.

TI  == animal rennets as sources of dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the microbial composition of artisan and industrial animal rennet pastes was studied by using both culture-dependent and -independent approaches. pyrosequencing targeting the 16s rrna gene allowed to identify 361 operational taxonomic units (otus) to the genus/species level. among lactic acid bacteria (lab), streptococcus thermophilus and some lactobacilli, mainly lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus reuteri, were the most abundant species, with differences among the samples. twelve groups of microorganisms were targeted by viable plate counts revealing a dominance of mesophilic cocci. all rennets were able to acidify ultrahigh-temperature-processed (uht) milk as shown by ph and total titratable acidity (tta). presumptive lab isolated at the highest dilutions of acidified milks were phenotypically characterized, grouped, differentiated at  the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis, and subjected to 16s rrna gene sequencing. only 18 strains were clearly identified at the species level, as enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii, and streptococcus thermophilus, while the other strains, all belonging to the genus enterococcus, could not be allotted into any previously described species. the phylogenetic analysis showed that these strains might represent different unknown species. all strains were evaluated for their dairy technological performances. all isolates produced diacetyl, and 10 of them produced a rapid ph drop in milk,  but only 3 isolates were also autolytic. this work showed that animal rennet pastes can be sources of lab, mainly enterococci, that might contribute to the microbial diversity associated with dairy productions.

TI  == antibiotic resistance, virulence determinants and production of biogenic amines among enterococci from ovine, feline, canine, porcine and human milk.
AB  == background: recent studies have shown that mammalian milk represents a continuous supply of commensal bacteria, including enterococci. the objectives of this study were to evaluate the presence of enterococci in milk of different species and to  screen them for several genetic and phenotypic traits of clinical significance among enterococci. results: samples were obtained from, at least, nine porcine, canine, ovine, feline and human healthy hosts. enterococci could be isolated, at  a concentration of 1.00 x 10(2) -1.16 x 10(3) cfu/ml, from all the porcine samples and, also from 85, 50, 25 and 25% of the human, canine, feline and ovine  ones, respectively. they were identified as enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus durans.  among the 120 initial enterococcal isolates, 36 were selected on the basis of their different pfge profiles and further characterized. mlst analysis revealed a wide diversity of sts among the e. faecalis and e. faecium strains, including some frequently associated to hospital infections and novel sts. all the e. faecalis strains possessed some of the potential virulence determinants (cad, ccf, cob, cpd, efaa(fs), agg2, gele, cyla, esp(fs)) assayed while the e. faecium  ones only harboured the efaa(fm) gene. all the tested strains were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin, and produced tyramine. their susceptibility to the rest of the antimicrobials and their ability to produce other biogenic amines varied depending on the strain. enterococci strains isolated from porcine samples showed the widest spectrum of antibiotic resistance. conclusions: enterococci isolated from milk of different mammals showed a great genetic diversity. the wide distribution of virulence genes and/or antibiotic resistance among the e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates indicates that they can constitute a reservoir of such traits and a risk to animal and human health.

TI  == genetic characterization of antibiotic resistance and virulence factors in enterococcus spp. from japanese retail ready-to-eat raw fish.
AB  == little information is available on the diversity and distribution of resistance and virulence factors in enterococci isolated from retail fish. in this study, 200 samples of retail ready-to-eat raw fish (sashimi) collected from the japanese prefecture of hiroshima were analyzed for incidence of enterococcus spp. we recovered 96 enterococcal isolates from 90 (45%, 90/200) samples. fifty-six strains were identified at the species level: e. faecalis (n = 31), e. faecium (n = 7), e. casseliflavus (n = 7), e. gallinarum (n = 3), e. phoeniculicola (n = 4), e. raffinosus (n = 2), e. saccharolyticus (n = 1), and e. gilvus (n = 1). twenty-five (26%, 25/96) strains carried antibiotic resistance genes. these included the tet(m), tet(l), tet(k), erm(b), msr(a/b), aph(3'), and blaz genes, which were detected in 12.5%, 9.3%, 2%, 14.5%, 1%, 1%, and 2% of isolates, respectively. the virulence genes gele and asa1 were detected in 31 and 24 e. faecalis strains, respectively. both genes were detected in one e. faecium strain. in conclusion, this is the first study to underscore the importance of sashimi as not only a reservoir of enterococcus spp. carrying resistance and virulence genes, but also a reservoir for unusual enterococcus spp.

TI  == microbiological quality of ready-to-eat salads: an underestimated vehicle of bacteria and clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes.
AB  == the increase demand for fresh vegetables is causing an expansion of the market for minimally processed vegetables along with new recognized food safety problems. to gain further insight on this topic we analyzed the microbiological quality of portuguese ready-to-eat salads (rts) and their role in the spread of bacteria carrying acquired antibiotic resistance genes, food products scarcely considered in surveillance studies. a total of 50 rts (7 brands; split or mixed leaves, carrot, corn) were collected in 5 national supermarket chains in porto region (2010). they were tested for aerobic mesophilic counts, coliforms and escherichia coli counts as well as for the presence of salmonella and listeria monocytogenes. samples were also plated in different selective media with/without antibiotics before and after enrichment. the e. coli, other coliforms and enterococcus recovered were characterized for antibiotic resistance profiles and  clonality with phenotypic and genetic approaches. a high number of rts presented  poor microbiological quality (86%--aerobic mesophilic counts, 74%--coliforms, 4%--e. coli), despite the absence of screened pathogens. in addition, a high diversity of bacteria (species and clones) and antibiotic resistance backgrounds  (phenotypes and genotypes) were observed, mostly with enrichment and antibiotic selective media. e. coli was detected in 13 samples (n=78; all types and 4 brands; phylogenetic groups a, b1 and d; none stec) with resistance to tetracycline [72%; tet(a) and/or tet(b)], streptomycin (58%; aada and/or stra-strb), sulfamethoxazole (50%; sul1 and/or sul2), trimethoprim (50%; dfra1 or dfra12), ampicillin (49%; blatem), nalidixic acid (36%), ciprofloxacin (5%) or chloramphenicol (3%; cata). e. coli clones, including the widespread group d/st69, were detected in different samples from the same brand or different brands pointing out to a potential cross-contamination. other clinically relevant resistance genes were detected in 2 raoultella terrigena carrying a bla(shv-2) and 1 citrobacter freundii isolate with a qnrb9 gene. among enterococcus (n=108;  35 samples; enterococcus casseliflavus--40, enterococcus faecalis--20, enterococcus faecium--18, enterococcus hirae--9, enterococcus gallinarum--5, and  enterococcus spp.--16) resistance was detected for tetracyclines [6%; tet(m) and/or tet(l)], erythromycin [3%; erm(b)], nitrofurantoin (1%) or ciprofloxacin (1%). the present study places ready-to-eat salads within the spectrum of ecological niches that may be vehicles for antibiotic resistance bacteria/genes with clinical interest (e.g. e. coli-d-st69; bla(shv-2)) and these findings are worthy of attention as their spread to humans by ingestion cannot be dismissed.

AB  == antibiotic-resistant enterococci are important opportunistic pathogens and have been recovered from retail tomatoes. however, it is unclear where and how tomatoes are contaminated along the farm-to-fork continuum. specifically, the degree of pre-harvest contamination with enterococci is unknown. we evaluated the prevalence, diversity and antimicrobial susceptibilities of enterococci collected from tomato farms in the mid-atlantic united states. tomatoes, leaves, groundwater, pond water, irrigation ditch water, and soil were sampled and tested for enterococci using standard methods. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was  performed using the sensititre microbroth dilution system. enterococcus faecalis  isolates were characterized using amplified fragment length polymorphism to assess dispersal potential. enterococci (n = 307) occurred in all habitats and colonization of tomatoes was common. seven species were identified: enterococcus  casseliflavus, e. faecalis, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avis, enterococcus hirae and enterococcus raffinosus. e. casseliflavus predominated in soil and on tomatoes and leaves, and e. faecalis predominated in pond water. on plants, distance from the ground influenced presence of enterococci. e. faecalis from samples within a farm were more closely related than those from samples between farms. resistance to rifampicin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin was prevalent. consumption of raw tomatoes as a potential exposure risk for antibiotic-resistant enterococcus spp. deserves further attention.

TI  == comparison of enterococcus species diversity in marine water and wastewater using enterolert and epa method 1600.
AB  == epa method 1600 and enterolert are used interchangeably to measure enterococcus for fecal contamination of public beaches, but the methods occasionally produce different results. here we assess whether these differences are attributable to the selectivity for certain species within the enterococcus group. both methods were used to obtain 1279 isolates from 17 environmental samples, including influent and effluent of four wastewater treatment plants, ambient marine water from seven different beaches, and freshwater urban runoff from two stream systems. the isolates were identified to species level. detection of non-enterococcus species was slightly higher using enterolert (8.4%) than for epa method 1600 (5.1%). e. faecalis and e. faecium, commonly associated with human fecal waste, were predominant in wastewater; however, enterolert had greater selectivity for e. faecalis, which was also shown using a laboratory-created sample. the same species selectivity was not observed for most beach water and urban runoff samples. these samples had relatively higher proportions of plant associated species, e. casseliflavus (18.5%) and e. mundtii (5.7%), compared to wastewater, suggesting environmental inputs to beaches and runoff. the potential  for species selectivity among water testing methods should be considered when assessing the sanitary quality of beaches so that public health warnings are based on indicators representative of fecal sources.

TI  == [comparison of phoenix automated system, api id 32 strep system and lightcycler enterococcus mgrade system in the identification of clinical enterococcus isolates].
AB  == enterococci which are part of the commensal flora of the human gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts, are increasing in importance as the cause of hospital-acquired infections. identification of enterococcus spp. at the species  level is of great importance, for appropriate treatment of patients, infection control and to supply epidemiological data. conventional methods for the identification of enterococcus isolates at species level is difficult and time consuming. correct identification of enterococcus isolates in clinical microbiology laboratory by conventional methods is replaced by semi-automated or  automated identification and molecular methods. the aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of phoenix automated system (bd diagnostic systems, usa), api rapid id 32 strep system (biomerieux, france) and enterococcus mgrade lightcycler kit (roche molecular biochemicals, germany) used in real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr), for the species level identification of enterococcus strains isolated from clinical specimens. a total of 90 vancomycin susceptible enterococci isolated from different patients were identified by all of the three commercial systems, together with conventional methods. of the strains, 59 were identified as e.faecalis, 28 were e.faecium, and one of each as  e.raffinosus, e.hirae and e.casseliflavus with conventional methods. one e.faecalis strain identified by the conventional system was identified as e.faecium by phoenix system and one e.faecium strain as e.durans. one e.raffinosus strain identifed by the conventional method was identified as e.avium by api. conventionally identified four e.faecalis strains were determined to be e.faecium by rt-pcr and one e.faecium, one e.raffinosus and one e.casseliflavus as e.faecalis. accordingly, the consistency of phoenix, api rapid id 32 strep and lightcycler enterococcus mgrade systems with the conventional methods were detected as 97.8% (88/90), 98.9% (89/90), and 92.2% (83/90), respectively. in conclusion, all of those three commercial assays are appropriate methods to be used for the identification of enterococci at the species level in  the routine clinical microbiology laboratories, due to their high compliance with the conventional method, and their ability to yield the results at the same day.

AB  == little is known about the impacts of fecal polluted urban runoff inputs on the structure of enterococci communities in estuarine waters. this study employed a 23s rrna gene-based polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay with newly designed genus-specific primers, ent127f-ent907r, to determine the possible impacts of hurricane katrina floodwaters via the 17th street canal discharge on the community structure of enterococci in lake pontchartrain. a total of 94 phylotypes were identified through the restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) screening of 494 clones while only 8 phylotypes occurred among 88 cultivated isolates. sequence analyses of representative phylotypes and their temporal and spatial distribution in the lake and the canal indicated the katrina floodwater input introduced a large portion of enterococcus flavescens, enterococcus casseliflavus, and enterococcus dispar into the lake; typical fecal  groups enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus hirae, and enterococcus mundtii were detected primarily in the floodwater-impacted waters. this study provides a global picture of enterococci in estuarine waters impacted  by hurricane katrina-derived urban runoff. it also demonstrates the culture-independent pcr approach using 23s rrna gene as a molecular marker could  be a good alternative in ecological studies of enterococci in natural environments to overcome the limitation of conventional cultivation methods.

TI  == environmental contamination by dog&#8217;s faeces: a public health problem?
AB  == the risk to public health from the large number of dog stools present on streets  of urban areas is cause for concern. dog faeces may be a serious hazard because they may contain microorganisms that are both pathogenic to humans and resistant  to several classes of antibiotics. the aim of this study was to evaluate the potential for zoonotic infections and for the presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in canine faeces which contaminates the urban environment. a total of 418 canine faecal samples were collected from streets in seven areas of bari, southern italy. we have isolated multi-drug resistant enterococci and meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus from these dog faecal samples. the presence of the resistant bacteria in an urban environment may represent a public health hazard which requires control measures by competent authorities. no salmonella, yersinia or campylobacter species were isolated. giardia cysts were detected in 1.9% of the samples. the predominant enterococcus species were e. faecium (61.6%), e. gallinarum (23.3%) and e. casseliflavus (5.5%). other species, including e. faecalis were also isolated. these strains were resistant to clindamycin (86.3%), tetracycline (65.7%), erythromycin (60.27%) and ampicillin (47.9%). high-level aminoglycoside resistance (hlar) was found in 65.7% of enterococci. resistance to three or more antibiotics and six or more antibiotics were observed in 67.12% and 38.4% of enterococcus spp., respectively. resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin was not detected in any of the enterococcus spp. isolated. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 0.7% of the faecal samples. canine faeces left on the streets may represent a risk factor for transmission of microorganisms and a reservoir of multidrug- resistant bacteria thus contributing to the spread of resistance genes into an urban area.

TI  == assessment of safe enterococci as bioprotective cultures in low-acid fermented sausages combined with high hydrostatic pressure.
AB  == three bacteriocinogenic, non-aminogenic and non-virulent enterococcus strains (enterococcus faecium ctc8005, enterococcus devriesei ctc8006 and enterococcus casseliflavus ctc8003) were used as starter cultures in low-acid fermented sausages to assess their competitiveness and their bioprotective potential against listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus. the inoculated strains  were successfully monitored by rapd-pcr. all the strains were able to grow, survive and dominate the endogenous enterococci population and avoided the growth of enterobacteriaceae. e. devriesei ctc8006 and e. faecium ctc8005 particularly inhibited the growth of l. monocytogenes during the whole ripening process. s. aureus was not affected by the inoculated bacteriocinogenic enterococci strains.  the application of high hydrostatic pressure (hhp) treatment (600 mpa for 5 min)  at the end of ripening (day 21) produced an immediate reduction in the counts of  enterobacteriaceae to levels <1 log cfu/g and promoted a decrease of 1-log unit in the counts of s. aureus. e. faecium ctc8005, which reduced the counts of l. monocytogenes ca. 2 log cfu/g immediately after stuffing and in combination with  hhp treatment promoted a further reduction of 1 log cfu/g in the pathogen counts. the combination of e. faecium ctc8005 and hhp was the most efficient antilisterial approach.

TI  == development of quantitative pcr assays targeting the 16s rrna genes of enterococcus spp. and their application to the identification of enterococcus species in environmental samples.
AB  == the detection of environmental enterococci has been determined primarily by using culture-based techniques that might exclude some enterococcal species as well as  those that are nonculturable. to address this, the relative abundances of enterococci were examined by challenging fecal and water samples against a currently available genus-specific assay (entero1). to determine the diversity of enterococcal species, 16s rrna gene-based group-specific quantitative pcr (qpcr)  assays were developed and evaluated against eight of the most common environmental enterococcal species. partial 16s rrna gene sequences of 439 presumptive environmental enterococcal strains were analyzed to study further the diversity of enterococci and to confirm the specificities of group-specific assays. the group-specific qpcr assays showed relatively high amplification rates with targeted species (>98%), although some assays cross-amplified with nontargeted species (1.3 to 6.5%). the results with the group-specific assays also showed that different enterococcal species co-occurred in most fecal samples. the most abundant enterococci in water and fecal samples were enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, although we identified more water isolates as enterococcus casseliflavus than as any of the other species. the prevalence of the entero1 marker was in agreement with the combined number of positive signals determined by the group-specific assays in most fecal samples, except in gull feces. on the other hand, the number of group-specific assay signals was lower in all water samples tested, suggesting that other enterococcal species are present in these samples. while the results highlight the value of genus- and group-specific assays for detecting the major enterococcal groups in environmental water samples, additional studies are needed to determine further the diversity, distributions, and relative abundances of all enterococcal species found in water.

TI  == screening fecal enterococci from greek healthy infants for susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == enterococci are among the first lactic acid bacteria to colonize the neonatal gastrointestinal tract, but they are also characterized as significant nosocomial pathogens. the aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of antibiotic resistance in enterococci isolated from neonates' gut microbiota as well as the presence of genetic determinants encoding for certain antibiotic resistance traits. a total of 263 fecal samples derived from 97 infants were collected on day 4, 30, and 90 after delivery. enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently identified species (54.6%) followed by e. faecium, while e. casseliflavus/e. flavescens and e. gallinarum were also traced. the isolates were examined for their resistance to 12 antibiotics. rifampicin resistance was the highest observed (53.2%), followed by resistance to tetracycline (42.0%), erythromycin (35.7%), and vancomycin (11.2%). multiresistant strains were highly prevalent. only intrinsic vancomycin resistance (vanc1 and vanc2/c3) was traced. the ermb gene was detected in 49 out of 96 erythromycin-resistant isolates, while tet genes were detected in 51 out of 113 tetracycline-resistant strains, with tet(l)  being the most frequently observed. in conclusion, antibiotic-resistant enterococci are already established in the fecal microbiota of healthy neonates,  from the first days of an infant's life.

TI  == enterococcus in wound infections: virulence and antimicrobial resistance.
AB  == enterococci, a complex group of facultative pathogens have become increasingly isolated in various hospital settings. they are considerable frequently cultured  from traumatic and surgical wounds. we investigated 57 strains of the species e.  faecalis, e. faecium and e. casseliflavus isolated from infected wounds. their ability to produce virulence factors and their sensitivity to antibiotics were evaluated using phenotypic and genotyping methods. in the phenotype studies, significant portion of the isolates produced biofilm (66.7%) and gelatinase (36.8%). nearly 30% of the strains expressed hemolytic properties. only a few produced dnase (15.8%) and lipase (7.0%). the genes esp, gele, cyla, cylb, cylm and agg were detected in most of the isolates (38.6-87.7%). all the isolated enterococci were susceptible to vancomycin and were characterized by their low resistance to antibiotics, except aminoglycosides (hlr).

TI  == evaluation of species-specific pcr, bruker ms, vitek ms and the vitek 2 system for the identification of clinical enterococcus isolates.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the performance of species-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr), matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) and phenotypic identification systems for the identification of enterococcus species. a total of 132 clinical isolates were investigated by the following: (1) a multiplex real-time pcr assay targeting ddl enterococcus faecium, ddl enterococcus faecalis, vanc1 and vanc2/c3 genes, and a high-resolution melting (hrm) analysis of the groesl gene for the differentiation of enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum; (2) bruker ms; (3) vitek ms; and (4) the vitek 2 system. 16s rrna gene sequencing was used as a reference method in the study. the 132 isolates were identified as 32 e. faecalis, 63 e. faecium, 16  e. casseliflavus and 21 e. gallinarum. the multiplex pcr, bruker ms and vitek ms  were able to identify all the isolates correctly at the species level. the vitek  2 system could identify 131/132 (99.2 %) and 121/132 (91.7 %) of the isolates at  the genus and species levels, respectively. the hrm-groesl assay identified all (21/21) e. gallinarum isolates and 81.3 % (13/16) of the e. casseliflavus isolates. the pcr methods described in the present study are effective in identifying the enterococcal species. maldi-tof ms is a rapid, reliable and cost-effective identification technique for enterococci. the vitek 2 system is less efficient at detecting non-faecalis and non-faecium enterococcus species.

TI  == speciation and frequency of virulence genes of enterococcus spp. isolated from rainwater tank samples in southeast queensland, australia.
AB  == in this study, 212 enterococcus isolates from 23 rainwater tank samples in southeast queensland (seq), australia were identified to the species level. the isolates were also tested for the presence of 6 virulence genes associated with enterococcus related infections. among the 23 rainwater tank samples, 20 (90%), 10 (44%), 7 (30%), 5 (22%), 4 (17%), 2 (9%), and 1 (4%) samples yielded e. faecalis, e. mundtii, e. casseliflavus, e. faecium, e. hirae, e. avium, and e. durans, respectively. among the 6 virulence genes tested, gele and efaa were most prevalent, detected in 19 (83%) and 18 (78%) of 23 rainwater tank samples, respectively. virulence gene ace was also detected in 14 (61%) rainwater tank samples followed by as, esp (e. faecalis variant), and cyla genes which were detected in 3 (13%), 2 (9%), and 1 (4%) samples, respectively. in all, 120 (57%)  enterococcus isolates from 20 rainwater tank samples harbored virulence genes. among these tank water samples, enterococcus spp. from 5 (25%) samples harbored a single virulence gene and 15 (75%) samples were harboring two or more virulence genes. the significance of these strains in terms of health implications remains  to be assessed. the potential sources of these strains need to be identified for  the improved management of captured rainwater quality. finally, it is recommended that enterococcus spp. should be used as an additional fecal indicator bacterium  in conjunction with e. coli for the microbiological assessment of rainwater tanks.

TI  == antibiotic-resistant enterococci in seawater and sediments from a coastal fish farm.
AB  == the aim of this study was to detect and characterize antibiotic-resistant enterococci in seawater and sediment from a mediterranean aquaculture site where  no antibiotics are used. colonies (650) grown on slanetz-bartley (sb) agar were amplified on antibiotic-supplemented sb, and erythromycin (ery), tetracycline (tet), and ampicillin (amp) mics were determined. of 75 resistant isolates (17 to tet, 5 to ery, and 45 to amp), 5 enterococcus faecalis, 25 e. faecium, 5 e. casseliflavus, 1 e. gallinarum, 1 e. durans, and 23 enterococcus spp. were identified by genus- and species-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr). tet(m), tet(o), tet(l), tet(k), erm(b), erm(a), erm(c), mef, msr, blaz, and int(tn916) were sought by pcr, including an improved multiplex pcr assay targeting tet(m), tet(l), and erm(b). tet(m) was the most frequent tet resistance gene; msr(c) was the sole ery resistance gene detected. blaz was found in 29/45 amp-resistant isolates; however, no beta-lactamase production was detected. antibiotic-resistant enterococci were recovered 2 km off the coast despite the absence of selective pressure exerted by antibiotic use. the occurrence of resistant strains in the absence of the tested genes may indicate the presence of less common resistance determinants. this first evidence of resistant enterococci at a mediterranean aquaculture site suggests the existence of a marine reservoir  of antibiotic resistances potentially transmissible to virulent strains that could be affected by mariculture in an antibiotic-independent manner.

TI  == comparative genomics of enterococci: variation in enterococcus faecalis, clade structure in e. faecium, and defining characteristics of e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus.
AB  == the enterococci are gram-positive lactic acid bacteria that inhabit the gastrointestinal tracts of diverse hosts. however, enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis have emerged as leading causes of multidrug-resistant hospital-acquired  infections. the mechanism by which a well-adapted commensal evolved into a hospital pathogen is poorly understood. in this study, we examined high-quality draft genome data for evidence of key events in the evolution of the leading causes of enterococcal infections, including e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. casseliflavus, and e. gallinarum. we characterized two clades within what is currently classified as e. faecium and identified traits characteristic of each,  including variation in operons for cell wall carbohydrate and putative capsule biosynthesis. we examined the extent of recombination between the two e. faecium  clades and identified two strains with mosaic genomes. we determined the underlying genetics for the defining characteristics of the motile enterococci e. casseliflavus and e. gallinarum. further, we identified species-specific traits that could be used to advance the detection of medically relevant enterococci and their identification to the species level.

TI  == diurnal variation in enterococcus species composition in polluted ocean water and a potential role for the enterococcal carotenoid in protection against photoinactivation.
AB  == enterococcus species composition was determined each hour for 72 h at a polluted  marine beach in avalon, santa catalina island, ca. species composition during the day was significantly different from that at night, based on an analysis of similarity. enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis were more prevalent at night than during the day, while e. hirae and other enterococcus species were more prevalent during the day than the night. enterococcus spp. containing a yellow pigment were more common during the day than the night, suggesting that the pigmented phenotype may offer a competitive advantage under sunlit conditions. a  laboratory microcosm experiment established that the pigmented e. casseliflavus isolate and a pigmented e. faecalis isolate recovered from the field site decay slower than a nonpigmented e. faecalis isolate in a solar simulator in simulated, clear seawater. this further supports the idea that the yellow carotenoid pigment in enterococcus provides protection under sunlit conditions. the findings are in  accordance with previous work with other carotenoid-containing nonphotosynthetic  and photosynthetic bacteria that suggests that the carotenoid is able to quench reactive oxygen species capable of causing photoinactivation and photostress. the results suggest that using enterococcal species composition as a microbial source tracking tool may be hindered by the differential environmental persistence of pigmented and nonpigmented enterococci.

TI  == bacteriophage lysis of enterococcus host strains: a tool for microbial source tracking?
AB  == this paper describes the isolation of enterococcus host strains, for potential use as simple bacteriophage (phage)-based microbial source tracking (mst) tools.  presumptive enterococcus host strains were isolated from cattle feces, raw municipal wastewater, agricultural runoff, and waters impacted by farms or wastewater treatment works (wwtw) in southern england, united kingdom (uk). all enterococcal host strains (n = 390) were first screened for their ability to detect phage in samples of raw municipal wastewater and fecal material from cattle, pigs, and sheep. host strains that detected phage (n = 147) were ranked according to both their specificity to a particular fecal source and also the number of phages (expressed as plaque-forming units, pfu) that they detected per  milliliter of sample. host strains that demonstrated host specificity and which detected phages at levels greater than 100 pfu/ml (n = 29) were further tested using additional fecal samples of human and nonhuman origin. the specificity and  sensitivity of the enterococcal host strains were found to vary, ranging from 44  to 100% and from 17 to 83%, respectively. most notably, seven strains exhibited 100% specificity to either cattle, human, or pig samples. isolates exhibiting specificity to cattle were identified as belonging to the species enterococcus casseliflavus , enterococcus mundtii , or enterococcus gallinarum , while human and pig isolates were members of either enterococcus faecium or enterococcus faecalis . the high specificity of phages infecting enterococcus hosts and the simplicity and relatively low cost of the approach collectively indicate a strong potential for using this method as a tool in mst.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in faecal microbiota of greek healthy infants.
AB  == increasing use of antibiotics for the treatment of infectious diseases and also for non-therapeutic reasons (agriculture, animal husbandry and aquaculture) has led to the increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance and the ineffectiveness  of antimicrobial treatment. commensal intestinal bacteria are very often exposed  to the selective pressure of antimicrobial agents and may constitute a reservoir  of antibiotic resistance determinants that can be transferred to pathogens. the present study aimed to investigate the antibiotic susceptibility profile and the  presence of selected resistance genes in cocci isolated from the faecal microbiota of 35 healthy, full-term infants at 4, 30 and 90 days after delivery.  a total of 148 gram-positive, catalase-negative cocci were isolated and tested for susceptibility to 12 different antibiotics by disk-diffusion technique. multiplex pcr analysis was performed for the identification of enterococcus spp.  isolates and the simultaneous detection of vancomycin-resistance genes. pcr-based methodology was used also for identification of tetracycline and erythromycin resistance determinants. identification results indicated e. faecalis as the predominant species (81 strains), followed by e. faecium, e. casseliflavus/e. flavescens and e. gallinarum. high prevalence of resistance to tetracycline (39.9%), erythromycin (35.1%), vancomycin (19.6%) and to nucleic acid synthesis inhibitors was detected. pcr data revealed 24 out of 52 erythromycin-resistant isolates carrying the ermb gene and 32 out of 59 tetracycline-resistant strains carrying tet genes, with tet(l) determinant being the most frequently detected. only intrinsic vancomycin resistance (vanc1 and vanc2/c3) was reported among tested isolates. in conclusion, erythromycin and tetracycline acquired resistant  traits are widespread among faecal cocci isolates from greek, healthy infants under no apparent antimicrobial selective pressure.

AB  == the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk has been recently described in staphylococcus aureus, but so far has not been found in other bacteria. a total of 166 enterococci of different species (e. faecium, e. faecalis, e. hirae, e. durans, e. gallinarum, and e. casseliflavus) and origins (food, clinical diseases in humans, healthy humans or animals, and sewage) were studied for their susceptibility to trimethoprim as determined by agar dilution (european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing) and the presence of (a) the dfrk gene and its genetic environment and (b) other dfr genes. the dfrk gene was detected in 49% of the enterococci (64% and 42% of isolates with minimum inhibitory concentrations of >/=2 mg/l or </=1 mg/l, respectively). the tet(l)-dfrk linkage  was detected in 21% of dfrk-positive enterococci. the chromosomal location of the dfrk gene was identified in one e. faecium isolate in which the dfrk was not linked to tet(l) gene but was part of a tn559 element, which was integrated in the chromosomal radc gene. this tn559 element was also found in 14 additional isolates. all combinations of dfr genes were detected among the isolates tested (dfrk, dfrg, dfrf, dfrk+dfrg, dfrk+dfrf, dfrf+dfrg, and dfrf+dfrg+dfrk). the gene dfrk gene was found together with other dfr genes in 58% of the tested enterococci. this study suggested an exchange of the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk between enterococci and staphylococci, as previously observed for the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrg.

TI  == clinico-epidemiological profile and high-level aminoglycoside resistance in enterococcal septicemia from a tertiary care hospital in east delhi.
AB  == background: emergence of high-level aminoglycoside and glycopeptide resistance has significantly contributed to the mortality, particularly in serious enterococcal infections. objectives: this study was aimed to determine the prevalence of high-level gentamicin resistance (hlgr), high-level streptomycin resistance (hlsr) and vancomycin resistance in enterococcal isolates recovered from patients with bacteremia. materials and methods: a total of 110 blood culture isolates of enterococci were recovered from septicemic patients. routine  antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed and screening for ampilcillin, high-level aminoglycoside resistance (hlar) and high-level vancomycin resistance  was done by agar screen method. results: out of 110 isolates, enterococcus faecium accounted for 53% of these isolates, followed by enterococcus fecalis (33%), enterococcus casseliflavus (8%), enterococcus raffinosus (4%) and enterococcus dispar (2%). resistance to ampicillin, hlgr, hlsr and hlar was detected in 58%, 62%, 58% and 54% of the isolates, respectively. no isolate was resistant to vancomycin. conclusion: this study illustrates the high prevalence of hlar in enterococci from patients with septicemia in our region, which emphasizes the need to predict synergy between beta-lactams and aminoglycosides for management of enterococcal infections.

TI  == prevalence of vanc vancomycin-resistant enterococci in the teaching hospitals of  the university of debrecen, hungary.
AB  == vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) are common nosocomial pathogens; however,  until now they have been rarely encountered in hungary. in the present study, we  investigated the prevalence of vre in the teaching hospitals of the university of debrecen. of 7,271 enterococcus-containing clinical samples collected between 2004 and 2009, we identified 16 vre. species-specific polymerase chain reaction was used to detect enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus casseliflavus, and enterococcus gallinarum. multiplex polymerase chain reaction was performed to identify the vancomycin resistance genes: vana, vanb, vanc1/c2,  vand, vane, and vang. restriction digestion with sali and hindiii was introduced  to differentiate the vanc1 and vanc2 genes from each other. genetic relationships between the strains were investigated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. overall, we identified the vanc1 resistance gene in 14 e. gallinarum and the vanc2 resistance gene in two e. casseliflavus strains. except for two samples, the isolates had different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis types, suggesting sporadic emergence of the resistant bacteria. in addition, antibiotic resistance  profile was determined by e-test. three e. gallinarum strains proved to be resistant to gentamicin because of the presence of the aaca-aphd gene. although the prevalence of vre in debrecen is rather low, the appearance of multiple resistances is of concern.

TI  == characterization of the mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance in vancomycin-resistant enterococci of different origins.
AB  == the mutations in gyra and parc genes were analyzed in 22 vancomycin-resistant enterococci of different origins and species, which had varying susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (minimum inhibitory concentration, mic: 0.5- >256 mg/l). all vana or vanb2-containing strains with ciprofloxacin mic of >32 mg/l presented amino acid changes in gyra protein (s83i, s83y, s83r or s83i-e87g) with/without changes in parc protein (s80i or s80r or s80l). strains with lower ciprofloxacin mics presented the gyra and parc wild type. one vana-containing enterococcus durans strain with a ciprofloxacin mic of 64 mg/l presented the s83i and s80i changes in gyra and parc proteins, respectively. two vanb2 enterococcus faecium strains were typed by multi-locus-sequencetyping and both were ascribed to the cc17 clonal complex with two sequence-types (st78 and st17-like). all seven vancomycin-resistant and ciprofloxacin-resistant e. faecium strains showed ampicillin resistance (mic 32-256 mg/l), identifying the following amino acid changes in pbp5 protein: q461k, v462k, h470q, m485a, n496k, a499t, e525d, n546t,  a558t, g582s, k632q, p642l, e629v and p667s, together with a serine insertion at  position 466 . the 12 enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus isolates included in the study exhibited an mic for ciprofloxacin in the range 0.5-16 mg/l and no amino acid changes were identified in gyra or parc proteins. specific mutations in gyra and parc genes are associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in e. faecium and e. durans of different origins.

TI  == species distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococci isolated from broilers infected experimentally with eimeria spp and fed with diets containing different supplements.
AB  == resistant bacteria in animal can be spread to environment and to humans. poultry  feed and infections caused by eimeria spp. are important factors in determining the intestinal microbial communities. the aim of this study was to verify the prevalence of species and antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococcus isolated from broilers fed with different supplements and infected experimentally with eimeria spp. broilers were divided in eight groups, fed with diets supplemented with a combination of antimicrobial, ionophore-coccidiostatics, probiotic, essential oil. at 14 days old all birds, except the control, received a solution  containing oocysts of eimeria spp. samples of cloacal swabs from broilers were collected. a total of 240 enterococcus sp. strains were isolated, confirmed genus by pcr, classified as species, tested for antimicrobial susceptibility and screened by pcr for the presence of tet(l), tet(m) and erm(b) genes. the overall  distribution of species isolated from fecal samples was e. faecalis (40%), followed by e. casseliflavus/e. gallinarum (10.8%), e. mundtii (10.8%), e. faecium (10.8%), e. columbae (5.8%) and e. gallinarum (4.2%). changes in the composition or frequency of enterococcus species were observed in all dietary supplementation. antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed resistance phenotypes  a range of antibiotics, especially used in humans such as, streptomycin, penicillin, rifampicin and vancomycin. there was no correlation between different supplementation for broilers and antimicrobial resistance and the presence of tet(m), tet(l) and erm(b) genes. dietary supplementation had effect on the enterococcus sp. colonization, but did not have significant effect on the phenotype and genotype of antimicrobial resistance in enterococci.

TI  == bacteriophage-mediated transduction of antibiotic resistance in enterococci.
AB  == aims: temperate bacteriophages are bacterial viruses that transfer genetic information between bacteria. this phenomenon is known as transduction, and it is important in acquisition of bacterial virulence genes and antimicrobial resistance determinants. the aim of this study was to demonstrate the role of bacteriophages in gene transfer (antibiotic resistance) in enterococci. methods and results: three bacteriophages from environmental samples isolated on pig host strains of enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus faecalis were evaluated in transduction experiments. antibiotic resistance was transferred from ent. gallinarum to ent. faecalis (tetracycline resistance) and from ent. faecalis to enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae/durans and enterococcus casseliflavus (gentamicin resistance). conclusions: bacteriophages play a role in transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants in enterococci. significance and impact of the study: this study confirms previous suggestions on transduction in enterococci, in particular on interspecies transduction. interspecies transduction is significant because it widens the range of recipients involved in antimicrobial resistance transfer.

TI  == development of a dna microarray for enterococcal species, virulence, and antibiotic resistance gene determinations among isolates from poultry.
AB  == a dna microarray (enteroarray) was designed with probes targeting four species-specific taxonomic identifiers to discriminate among 18 different enterococcal species, while other probes were designed to identify 18 virulence factors and 174 antibiotic resistance genes. in total, 262 genes were utilized for rapid species identification of enterococcal isolates, while characterizing their virulence potential through the simultaneous identification of endogenous antibiotic resistance and virulence genes. enterococcal isolates from broiler chicken farms were initially identified by using the api 20 strep system, and the results were compared to those obtained with the taxonomic genes atpa, reca, phes, and ddl represented on our microarray. among the 171 isolates studied, five different enterococcal species were identified by using the api 20 strep system:  enterococcus faecium, e. faecalis, e. durans, e. gallinarum, and e. avium. the enteroarray detected the same species as api 20 strep, as well as two more: e. casseliflavus and e. hirae. species comparisons resulted in 15% (27 isolates) disagreement between the two methods among the five api 20 strep identifiable species and 24% (42 isolates) disagreement when considering the seven enteroarray identified species. the species specificity of key antibiotic and virulence genes identified by the enteroarray were consistent with the literature adding further  robustness to the redundant taxonomic probe data. sequencing of the cpn60 gene further confirmed the complete accuracy of the microarray results. the new enteroarray should prove to be a useful tool to accurately genotype strains of enterococci and assess their virulence potential.

TI  == insects in confined swine operations carry a large antibiotic resistant and potentially virulent enterococcal community.
AB  == background: extensive use of antibiotics as growth promoters in the livestock industry constitutes strong selection pressure for evolution and selection of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains. unfortunately, the microbial ecology and  spread of these bacteria in the agricultural, urban, and suburban environments are poorly understood. insects such as house flies (musca domestica) and german cockroaches (blattella germanica) can move freely between animal waste and food and may play a significant role in the dissemination of antibiotic resistant bacteria within and between animal production farms and from farms to residential settings. results: enterococci from the digestive tract of house flies (n = 162), and feces of german cockroaches (n = 83) and pigs (n = 119), collected from two commercial swine farms were isolated, quantified, identified, and screened for antibiotic resistance and virulence. the majority of samples (93.7%) were positive for enterococci with concentrations 4.2 +/- 0.7 x 10(4) cfu/house fly, 5.5 +/- 1.1 x 10(6) cfu/g of cockroach feces, and 3.2 +/- 0.8 x 10(5) cfu/g of pig feces. among all the identified isolates (n = 639) enterococcus faecalis was  the most common (55.5%), followed by e. hirae (24.9%), e. faecium (12.8%), and e. casseliflavus (6.7%). e. faecalis was most prevalent in house flies and cockroaches, and e. hirae was most common in pig feces. our data showed that multi-drug (mainly tetracycline and erythromycin) resistant enterococci were common from all three sources and frequently carried antibiotic resistance genes  including tet(m) and erm(b) and tn916/1545 transposon family. e. faecalis frequently harbored virulence factors gele, esp, and asa1. pfge analysis of selected e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates demonstrated that cockroaches and house flies shared some of the same enterococcal clones that were detected in the swine manure indicating that insects acquired enterococci from swine manure. conclusions: this study shows that house flies and german cockroaches in the confined swine production environment likely serve as vectors and/or reservoirs of antibiotic resistant and potentially virulent enterococci and consequently may play an important role in animal and public health.

TI  == virulence factors in enterococci from partridges (alectoris rufa) representing a  food safety problem.
AB  == forty-three enterococcus isolates recovered from fecal samples of partridges, during the partridge hunting season, were studied for gelatinase and beta-hemolysis activities. the presence of fsr-gele genes and the cyl operon was  studied by polymerase chain reaction and correlated with gelatinase and beta-hemolysis production, respectively. in addition, genes encoding additional virulence factors (cpd, hyl, agg, esp, and ace) was also analyzed in all enterococci. most of our enterococcus faecalis isolates showed gelatinase activity (10 of 15 isolates), and this activity was not present in the other enterococcal species. all enterococci that showed gelatinase activity harbored the gele and fsr genes. a large proportion of our isolates harbored genes of the  cyl operon (19 of 43 isolates), although only 1 isolate contained the five cyl tested genes (e. faecalis), being the only one that expressed beta-hemolysis. from the additional virulence factors (cpd, hyl, agg, esp, and ace), at least one virulence gene was detected in 13 of the 15 e. faecalis isolates, with cpd being  the most frequently detected gene (9 isolates), followed by agg (5 isolates) and  ace (4 isolates) genes. these virulence genes were not detected in the other enterococcal species with the exception of one e. faecium and e. casseliflavus isolate that harbored the hyl and cpd genes, respectively. moreover, the esp gene was not detected in any of our isolates. in conclusion, this study showed the presence of virulence factors in enterococci of partridges and the possible transmission to humans through the food chain.

TI  == characterization of antibiotic resistant enterococci isolated from untreated waters for human consumption in portugal.
AB  == untreated drinking water is frequently overlooked as a source of antibiotic resistance in developed countries. to gain further insight on this topic, we isolated the indicator bacteria enterococcus spp. from water samples collected in wells, fountains and natural springs supplying different communities across portugal, and characterized their antibiotic resistance profile with both phenotypic and genetic approaches. we found various rates of resistance to seven  antibiotic families. over 50% of the isolates were resistant to at least ciprofloxacin, tetracyclines or quinupristin-dalfopristin and 57% were multidrug  resistant to >/=3 antibiotics from different families. multiple enterococcal species (e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. hirae, e. casseliflavus and other enterococcus spp) from different water samples harbored genes encoding resistance to tetracyclines, erythromycin or gentamicin [tet(m)-46%, tet(l)-14%, tet(s)-5%,  erm(b)-22%, aac(6 )-ie-aph(2'')-12%] and putative virulence factors [gel-28%, asa1-16%]. the present study positions untreated drinking water within the spectrum of ecological niches that may be reservoirs of or vehicles for antibiotic resistant enterococci/genes. these findings are worthy of attention as spread of antibiotic resistant enterococci to humans and animals through water ingestion cannot be dismissed.

AB  == enterococcus isolates (1500) obtained from the feces of 48 humans, 209 domesticated food animals, and 155 wild geese in south korea were characterized with respect to species status by pcr analyses and resistance to antibiotics. of  the 1500 strains examined, the majority (n=577) were enterococcus faecalis from 224 (54.4%) of the samples feces, while 299 were of e. faecium from 125 of the samples (30.3%), 224 were e. hirae from 101 (24.5%) of the samples, 94 were e. casseliflavus from 43 (10.4%) of the samples, and one was e. gallinarum. while 305 isolated from 125 (30.3%) of the samples were unidentified species. approximately 15, 60, 50, 55, 3, and 40% of samples obtained from beef cattle, chickens, ducks, swine, wild geese, and humans, respectively, yielded enterococcus isolates that were resistant to high-levels of aminoglycosides (i.e., of gentamicin, kanamycin, and streptomycin, minimum inhibitory concentrations were >1000 mg/l). the 180 enterococcus isolates that showed high levels of resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics (hlar) were screened for virulence genes encoding for aggregation substance (agg), cytolysin activator (cyla), gelatinase (gele) and surface protein (esp). of those, the gele gene was  found most frequently in chickens and ducks of the hlar isolates, while 56 e. faecalis and 13 e. faecium hlar were gelatinase positive and showed hemolysin activity. multiple antibiotic resistant enterococcus isolates carrying virulence  genes were most frequently isolated from poultry and swine, and were mostly e. faecalis or e. faecium. these findings suggest that restriction of the use of antibiotics in food animal operations in south korea, especially those involved in poultry and swine production would be desirable.

TI  == antimicrobial and heavy metal resistance in commensal enterococci isolated from pigs.
AB  == antibiotic resistance in animal isolates of enterococci is of public health concern because of the risk of transfer of antibiotic resistance isolates or resistance determinants to consumers via the food chain. in this study, phenotypic and genotypic resistance in 192 pig isolates of enterococci to ampicillin, avilamycin, avoparcin, bacitracin, flavophospholipol, gentamicin, narasin, tetracycline, tiamulin, tylosin, vancomycin, virginiamycin, copper and zinc were investigated by susceptibility test and molecular methods. resistance rates varied between the species but all isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, avilamycin, avoparcin, gentamicin and narasin but resistant to tetracycline and tylosin and intermediately resistant to copper. only enterococcus gallinarum and  enterococcus casseliflavus were resistant to vancomycin and virginiamycin resistance was present in less than half the enterococcus faecium isolates. zinc  resistance was largely confined to enterococcus faecalis but bacitracin resistance was uncommon in e. faecalis in comparison with the other species. tiamulin resistance was common in all species except e. casseliflavus. resistance to flavophospholipol was detected in most e. faecium isolates and in a high proportion of e. gallinarum, e. casseliflavus and e. hirae/durans but was only found in one isolate of e. faecalis. no teto, rplc, rpld, vana, vanb, vata and vatd genes were found. the presence of ermb, tetl, tetm, tcrb, aac6-aph2, tetk, tets, vanc1, vanc2, lsaa, lsab and vate varied between the species and largely corresponded to the susceptibility phenotype. the findings show that resistance to antibiotics of high clinical significance for nosocomial enterococcus infections is absent, whereas antimicrobial resistance was detected for some other antibiotics including bacitracin, flavophospholipol, tetracycline, tiamulin, tylosin and virginiamycin.

TI  == ccrabent serine recombinase genes are widely distributed in the enterococcus faecium and enterococcus casseliflavus species groups and are expressed in e. faecium.
AB  == the presence, distribution and expression of cassette chromosome recombinase (ccr) genes, which are homologous to the staphylococcal ccrab genes and are designated ccrab(ent) genes, were examined in enterococcal isolates (n=421) representing 13 different species. a total of 118 (28 %) isolates were positive for ccrab(ent) genes by pcr, and a number of these were confirmed by southern hybridization with a ccra(ent) probe (n=76) and partial dna sequencing of ccra(ent) and ccrb(ent) genes (n=38). ccrab(ent) genes were present in enterococcus faecium (58/216, 27 %), enterococcus durans (31/38, 82 %), enterococcus hirae (27/52, 50 %), enterococcus casseliflavus (1/4, 25 %) and enterococcus gallinarum (1/2, 50 %). in the eight other species tested, including enterococcus faecalis (n=94), ccrab(ent) genes were not found. thirty-eight sequenced ccrab(ent) genes from five different enterococcal species showed 94-100 % nucleotide sequence identity and linkage pcrs showed heterogeneity in the ccrab(ent) flanking chromosomal genes. expression analysis of ccrab(ent) genes from the e. faecium do strain showed constitutive expression as a bicistronic mrna. the ccrab(ent) mrna levels were lower during log phase than stationary phase in relation to total mrna. multilocus sequence typing was performed on 39 isolates. ccrab(ent) genes were detected in both hospital-related (10/29, 34 %) and non-hospital (4/10, 40 %) strains of e. faecium. various sequence types were  represented by both ccrab(ent) positive and negative isolates, suggesting acquisition or loss of ccrab(ent) in e. faecium. in summary, ccrab(ent) genes, potentially involved in genome plasticity, are expressed in e. faecium and are widely distributed in the e. faecium and e. casseliflavus species groups.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of fecal indicators in municipal wastewater treatment plant.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance of fecal coliforms (n = 153) and enterococci (n = 199) isolates was investigated in municipal wastewater treatment plant (wwtp) based on activated sludge system. the number of fecal indicators (in influent and effluent as well as in the aeration chamber and in return activated sludge mixture) was determined using selective media. susceptibility of selected strains was tested against 19 (aminoglycosides, aztreonam, carbapenems, cephalosporins, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors, fluoroquinolones, penicillines, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) and 17 (high-level aminoglycosides, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, fluoroquinolones, glycopeptides, linezolid, lincosamides, nitrofuration, streptogramins, tetracycline) antimicrobial agents respectively. among enterococci the predominant species were enterococcus faecium (60.8%) and enterococcus faecalis (22.1%), while remaining isolates belonged to enterococcus hirae (12.1%), enterococcus casseliflavus/gallinarum (4.5%), and enterococcus durans (0.5%). resistance to nitrofuration and erythromycin was common among enterococci (53% and 44%, respectively), and followed by resistance to ciprofloxacin (29%) and tetracycline (20%). the resistance phenotypes related to glycopeptides (up to 3.2%) and high-level aminoglycosides (up to 5.4%) were also observed. most frequently, among escherichia coli isolates the resistance patterns were found for ampicillin (34%), piperacillin (24%) and tetracycline (23%). extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing e. coli was detected once, in the aeration chamber. in the study the applied wastewater treatment processes considerably reduced the number of fecal indicators. nevertheless their number in the wwtp effluent was higher than 10(4) cfu per 100 ml and periodically contained 90% of bacteria with antimicrobial resistance patterns. the positive selection of isolates with antimicrobial resistance patterns was observed during the treatment processes. substantial concern should be paid to the isolates resistant to 3 or more chemical classes of antimicrobials (mar). in treated wastewater mar e. coli  and mar enterococci constituted respectively 9% and 29% of tested isolates.

TI  == the importance of sediment and submerged aquatic vegetation as potential habitats for persistent strains of enterococci in a subtropical watershed.
AB  == recent evidence of extended survival of fecal indicator bacteria in sediments and submerged aquatic vegetation (sav) has raised concerns about using indicator bacteria to reliably detect fecal contamination. we monitored enterococci densities and population structure in water, sediment and sav simultaneously at sites across a subtropical watershed (tampa bay, fl, usa) over one year to determine the extent to which each matrix serves as a potential reservoir of enterococci. sav harbored significantly higher mean densities of enterococci than sediments, which harbored higher densities than water. mean enterococci densities were also greater at sites located further upstream in the watershed. the population structure assessed by box-pcr genotyping was relatively dissimilar in  each sample, although some similarities among samples suggested grouping by location. strain diversity ranged from very high to negligible, with lowest overall diversity in lake samples taken during the summer. several strains were highly abundant and cosmopolitan (found across sites, seasons, and matrices) and  were identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing as the enterococcus species casseliflavus, faecalis, faecium, hirae, and mundtii. the proportional dominance  of certain strains suggests the existence of persistent and possibly naturalized  indicator bacteria populations that are not directly related to pollution events.

AB  == marine recreational beaches are monitored for fecal contamination by enterococcus spp. (ent) counts. although different ent species in the environment tend to thrive in and originate from distinct hosts, the current monitoring method does not differentiate among species. time-consuming isolation-based species identification precludes routine analysis of environmental ent communities. therefore, an isolation-independent dna fingerprinting method was developed to characterize environmental ent communities using dna length polymorphism of the spacer region between the groes and groel genes common to most ent species. capillary electrophoresis resulted in distinct peak sizes of pcr products that carried polymorphic groesl spacers (300-335 bp in length) among 8 different ent species (enterococcus avium, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, and enterococcus faecalis). distortions in true species ratios observed in electropherograms were caused by pcr biases arising in a mixed ent community dna template. e. faecalis was overestimated and e. avium and e. faecium were underestimated compared to the original species ratios in the mixed community. the pcr product bias was constant between species, so good approximation of the species ratio in ent communities is possible. in environmental samples, a high percentage of e. faecalis (96%) together with high total ent counts were observed in samples collected from a sewer line and from several sites in a storm drain system where sewage leaks were suspected. in contrast, samples with <400 cfu 100  ml-1 ent were either dominated by e. mundtii or had 4 or more ent species. the latter ent community profiles are considered to be signatures of enterococci rarely associated with animals with low or of non-fecal origin.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in faecal bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococcus spp.) in feral pigeons.
AB  == aims: to determine the presence of antibiotic-resistant faecal escherichia coli and enterococcus spp. in feral pigeons (columba livia forma domestica) in the czech republic. methods and results: cloacal swabs of feral pigeons collected in  the city of brno in 2006 were cultivated for antibiotic-resistant e. coli. resistance genes, class 1 and 2 integrons, and gene cassettes were detected in resistant isolates by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the samples were also cultivated for enterococci. species status of enterococci isolates was determined using repetitive extragenic palindromic-pcr. resistance genes were detected in resistant enterococci by pcr. e. coli isolates were found in 203 of 247 pigeon samples. antibiotic resistance was recorded in three (1.5%, n(e. coli) =203) isolates. using agar containing ciprofloxacin, 12 (5%, n(samples) =247) e. coli strains resistant to ciprofloxacin were isolated. no esbl-producing e. coli isolates were detected. a total of 143 enterococci were isolated: ent. faecalis (36 isolates), ent. faecium (27), ent. durans (19), ent. hirae (17), ent. mundtii (17), ent. gallinarum (12), ent. casseliflavus (12) and ent. columbae (3). resistance to one to four antibiotics was detected in 45 (31%) isolates. resistances were determined by tetk, tetl, tetm, teto, aac(6')aph(2''), ant(4')-ia, aph(3')-iiia, ermb, pbp5, vana and vanc1 genes. conclusions: antibiotic-resistant e. coli and enterococcus spp. occurred in feral pigeons in various prevalences. significance and impact of the study: feral pigeon should be considered a risk species for spreading in the environment antimicrobial resistant e. coli and enterococci.

TI  == detection of human intestinal catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci by rrna-targeted reverse transcription-pcr.
AB  == an analytical system based on rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) for enumeration of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci was established. subgroup- or species-specific primer sets targeting 16s or 23s rrna  from enterococcus, streptococcus, and lactococcus were newly developed. the rt-qpcr method using these primers together with the previously reported primer sets specific for the enterococcus genus, the streptococcus genus, and several streptococcus species was found to be able to quantify the target populations with detection limits of 10(3) to 10(4) cells per gram feces, which was more than 100 times as sensitive as the qpcr method (10(6) to 10(8) cells per gram feces).  the rt-qpcr analysis of fecal samples from 24 healthy adult volunteers using the  genus-specific primer sets revealed that enterococcus and streptococcus were present as intestinal commensals at population levels of log(10) 6.2 +/- 1.4 and  7.5 +/- 0.9 per gram feces (mean +/- standard deviation [sd]), respectively. detailed investigation using species- or subgroup-specific primer sets revealed that the volunteers harbored unique enterococcus species, including the e. avium  subgroup, the e. faecium subgroup, e. faecalis, the e. casseliflavus subgroup, and e. caccae, while the dominant human intestinal streptococcus species was found to be s. salivarius. various lactococcus species, such as l. lactis subsp.  lactis or l. lactis subsp. cremoris, l. garvieae, l. piscium, and l. plantarum, were also detected but at a lower population level (log(10) 4.6 +/- 1.2 per gram  feces) and prevalence (33%). these results suggest that the rt-qpcr method enables the accurate and sensitive enumeration of human intestinal subdominant but still important populations, such as gram-positive cocci.

TI  == [detection of vancomycin-resistant enterococci using multiplex real-time pcr assay and melting curve analysis].
AB  == background: we developed and evaluated the utility of a multiplex real-time pcr assay that uses melting curve analysis and allows simultaneous identification of  vancomycin-resistant genotypes and clinically relevant enterococci. methods: the  specificity of the assay was tested using 4 reference strains of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and 2 reference strains of vancomycin-susceptible enterococci. ninety-three clinical isolates of enterococci with different glycopeptide-resistant phenotypes were genotyped and identified using a multiplex real-time pcr assay and melting curve analysis. results: representative melting curves were obtained for enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, vana-containing e. faecium, vanb-containing e. faecalis, enterococcus gallinarum, and enterococcus casseliflavus. phenotypic and genotypic analysis of the isolates revealed same results for 82 enterococcal isolates, while in 4 isolates, the glycopeptide-resistant phenotypes were inconsistent with the glycopeptide-resistant genotypes and in the 4 other isolates, species could not be accurately identified. three isolates with mixed strains, which were detected by the pcr assay, could not be correctly identified using phenotypic methods. conclusions: vre genotyping and identification of clinically relevant enterococci were rapidly and correctly performed using multiplex real-time pcr assay and melting curve analysis.

TI  == bacteremia caused by non-faecalis and non-faecium enterococcus species at a medical center in taiwan, 2000 to 2008.
AB  == summary objectives: human infections due to non-faecalis and non-faecium enterococcus species are emerging but data on the characteristics of these infections are limited. methods: we retrospectively reviewed the computerized database of the bacteriology laboratory at national taiwan university hospital from january 2000 through december 2008 to identify patients with non-faecalis and non-faecium enterococcal bacteremia. results: enterococcal bacteremia was diagnosed in 1887 patients during the study period and was caused by non-faecalis and non-faecium enterococci in 182 (9.6%) of these patients. the causative organisms included enterococcus casseliflavus (n = 59, 3.1%), enterococcus gallinarum (n = 58, 3.0%), enterococcus avium (n = 45, 2.4%), enterococcus hirae  (n = 9, 0.5%), enterococcus raffinosus (n = 9, 0.5%), enterococcus durans (n = 2, 0.1%), enterococcus cecorum (n = 2, 0.1%), and enterococcus canintestini (n = 1,  0.5%). a commercially-available phenotypic identification system misidentified six isolates based upon sequence analysis of 16s and groesl genes. among the 182  patients, 74 (40.7%) had catheter-associated bloodstream infection and 69 (37.9%) presented with biliary tract infection. healthcare-associated enterococcal bacteremia comprised 99 (54.4%) episodes and a polymicrobial etiology was found in 106 (58.2%) episodes. the clinical manifestations varied between the infecting enterococcus species. multivariate logistic regression showed that immunocompromised status is the only risk factor for the all cause mortality. conclusions: non-faecalis and non-faecium enterococcus species can cause protean  manifestations which vary with the infecting enterococcus species. misidentification of unusual enterococcal species might occur by the commercial identification methods and accurate identification with molecular methods is required.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal italian goat cheese.
AB  == the lactic acid bacteria community in traditional goat cheese produced in three dairies in valsesia (piemonte, italy) was studied at different steps of the manufacturing process. these cheeses were produced from raw milk without starter  bacteria, and no protocol was followed during the manufacturing process. three hundred thirty-two isolates were characterized and grouped by results of both morphophysiological tests and random amplification of polymorphic dna plus pcr analysis. bacteria were identified by partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. lactococci were the dominant lactic acid bacteria in raw milk. their initial numbers ranged from 5 to 7 log cfu ml(-1). their levels increased during manufacturing and decreased during ripening. the growth trend for enterococci was comparable to that of lactococci, although enterococci counts were lower. lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, lactococcus garviae, and enterococcus faecalis were the most frequently isolated species during goat cheese manufacturing, whereas the highest numbers of enterococcus (e. faecium, e. durans, e. gilvus, and e. casseliflavus) were isolated with the greatest frequency from ripened cheese samples. occasionally, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc lactis, and lactobacillus paraplantarum also were isolated.

TI  == characterization of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus isolates from broilers in selangor, malaysia.
AB  == vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) is an emerging nosocomial pathogen in humans. the use of antibiotics in human therapy and in the production of food animals has been incriminated in the emergence of this organism. the present study describes the distribution of vre species, the vancomycin-resistant genes detected, the vancomycin resistance pattern observed, and the genetic diversity of the isolates found in live broiler chickens in malaysia. overall 140 vre were  isolated with species comprising enterococcus faecalis (48%), enterococcus faecium (25.7%), enterococcus gallinarum (12.1%), enterococcus casseliflavus (1.4%) and other enterococcus species (12.8%). vancomycin resistance gene vana and intrinsic genes vanc1 and vanc2/3 were detected in the study population. vana was detected in 15 (63.9%) of e. faecium, 23 (22.4%) of e. faecalis and in 3 (17.6%) e. gallinarum isolates. e-test was conducted on randomly selected 41 of the isolates and the minimum inhibition concentration (mic) of vancomycin for five (11.9%) of tested isolates is more than 256 mug/ml. genotypic analysis using random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) showed genetic diversity within the enterococcus species.

TI  == prevalence and antibiotic resistance profiles of enterococcus species in chicken  at slaughter level; absence of vana and vanb genes in e. faecalis and e. faecium.
AB  == the prevalence of enterococci in neck skin samples of poultry from ankara region  in turkey was investigated and their antibiotic resistance patterns were determined. in the study, 83 of 106 analyzed neck skin samples were positive for  enterococcus, with e. faecium as the most prevalent species (48%) followed by e.  durans (23%) and e. faecalis (19%). lower numbers were detected for e. gallinarum, e. hirae, e. mundtii and e. casseliflavus. using the disc diffusion method, it was established that over 90% of e. faecium and e. faecalis isolates were high-level resistant against erythromycin and tetracycline. four e. faecium  isolates were additionally resistant to chloramphenicol, gentamicin and streptomycin, though they were susceptible to penicillin g. the most frequently observed multiple resistance in e. faecium (25%) was against erythromycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and streptomycin. of the e. faecalis isolates, 44%  were multiple resistant to erythromycin, tetracycline and streptomycin. vancomycin resistance could not be demonstrated phenotypically and vana or vanb genes were not detected by multiplex pcr in any of the isolates. nevertheless, the observed resistance patterns are of concern for public health.

AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) cross-transmission between two patient groups (long-term dialysis and kidney transplant patients). molecular typing, by  automated ribotyping with the riboprinter microbial characterization system (qualicon, usa), was used to analyze vre isolates from 31 fecal samples of 320 dialysis patients and 38 fecal samples of 280 kidney transplant patients. clonal  spread of e. faecalis and e. casseliflavus was observed intragroup, but not between the two groups of patients. in turn, transmission of e. gallinarum and e. faecium between the groups was suggested by the finding of vancomycin-resistant isolates belonging to the same ribogroup in both dialysis and transplant patients. the fact that these patients were colonized by vre from the same ribogroup in the same health care facility provides evidence for cross-transmission and supports the adoption of stringent infection control measures to prevent dissemination of these bacteria.

AB  == the goal of this study was to assess the presence of enterococci species presenting van-mediated glycopeptide resistance in french cattle. fecal samples were collected from healthy and sick animals, and enterococci were screened for vancomycin resistance. vancomycin resistance was principally encountered in enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus strains. however, glycopeptide resistance was detected in three different species of enterococci (e. faecalis, e. faecium, and e. casseliflavus). molecular characterization of the genetic support proved that they all presented the prototypic vana element. interestingly, the e. casseliflavus strain displayed a remarkable vanb phenotype/vana-vanc genotype. transferability, associated resistances, and factors of vana cotransfer were sought. this study proved that acquired vana genes can still be detected in food-producing animals more than a decade after the avoparcin ban. indeed, calves, which are recurrently exposed to antibiotics in france, may allow the re-emergence of glycopeptide resistance through coselection factors, and this might potentially be concerning for human health.

TI  == enterococcus faecalis with the gelatinase phenotype regulated by the fsr operon and with biofilm-forming capacity are common in the agricultural environment.
AB  == the prevalence of gelatinase activity and biofilm formation among environmental enterococci was assessed. in total, 396 enterococcal isolates from swine and cattle faeces and house flies from a cattle farm were screened for gelatinase activity. the most prevalent phenotype on todd-hewitt agar with 1.5% skim milk was the weak protease (wp) (72.2% of isolates), followed by the strong protease (sp) 18.7%, and no protease (np) (9.1%). the majority of wp isolates was represented by enterococcus hirae (56.9%), followed by enterococcus faecium (25.9%), enterococcus casseliflavus (10.4%), enterococcus gallinarum (5.2%) and enterococcus saccharolyticus (1.7%). all wp isolates were negative for gele (gelatinase) and spre (serine protease) as well as the fsrabdc operon that regulates the two proteases, and only four isolates (7.0%) formed biofilms in vitro. all sp isolates were enterococcus faecalis positive for the fsrabdc, gele, spre genes and the majority (91.2%) formed a biofilm. diversity of np isolates was relatively evenly distributed among e. hirae, e. faecium, e. casseliflavus, e. gallinarum, enterococcus durans, e. saccharolyticus and enterococcus mundtii.  all np isolates were negative for the fsr operon and only four e. hirae (11.1%) formed a biofilm. of further interest was the loss of the gelatinase phenotype (18.9% of isolates) from sp isolates after 4 month storage at 4-8 degrees c and several passages of subculture. results of reverse transcription pcr analysis indicated that mrna was produced for all the genes in the frs operon and sequencing of the gele gene did not reveal any significant mutations. however, gelatinase was not detectable by western blot analysis. our study shows that e. faecalis with the complete fsr operon and the potential to form a biofilm are relatively common in the agricultural environment and may represent a source/reservoir of clinically relevant strains. in addition, many environmental  enterococci, especially e. hirae, produce an unknown wp that can hydrolyse casein but does not contribute to biofilm formation. the stability of the gelatinase phenotype in e. faecalis and its regulation will require additional studies.

AB  == aims: this study aimed to analyse the diversity of the vanb gene cluster in enterococcal species isolated from sewage treatment plants (stp) in tehran, iran. methods and results: the enterococcal isolates were collected from three sewage treatment plants in tehran, iran, during 2005. a total of 203 enterococcal isolates, collected over six rounds of sampling from three stps were tested for the presence of vanb gene. long-pcr showed that amongst the isolates, three enterococcus faecium, one enterococcus gallinarum and one enterococcus casseliflavus harboured the complete vanb gene cluster. restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) of the vanb1 gene cluster (5900 bp) from the isolates  showed an identical pattern to a standard strain of enterococcus faecalis (v583). none of the isolates were able to transfer the vanb gene in conjugation experiments. different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns were obtained for the three e. faecium isolates with vanb gene clusters. conclusions: our results indicated that the dissemination of vanb is not widespread in tehran. although only a few vanb positive isolates were detected, vanb was found in several enterococcal species. significance and impact of the study: in view of the lack of information on vanb resistance genes and their diversity in iran, knowledge of the global dissemination of vanb genes in enterococcus spp. is noteworthy.

TI  == identification and tracing of enterococcus spp. by rapd-pcr in traditional fermented sausages and meat environment.
AB  == aims: four local small-scale factories were studied to determine the sources of enterococci in traditional fermented sausages. methods and results: different points during the production of a traditional fermented sausage type (fuet) were  evaluated. randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr was used to type 596 enterococcus isolates from the final products, the initial meat batter, the casing, the workers' hands and the equipment. species-specific pcr-multiplex and  the partial sequencing of atpa gene and 16s rrna gene sequencing allowed the identification of the isolates: enterococcus faecalis (31.4%), enterococcus faecium (30.7%), enterococcus sanguinicola (14.9%), enterococcus devriesei (9.7%), enterococcus malodoratus (7.2%), enterococcus gilvus (1.0%), enterococcus gallinarum (1.3%), enterococcus casseliflavus (3.4%), enterococcus hermanniensis  (0.2%), and enterococcus durans (0.2%). a total of 92 different rapd-pcr profiles were distributed among the different factories and samples evaluated. most of the genotypes found in fuet samples were traced back to their source. conclusions: the major sources of enterococci in the traditional fermented sausages studied were mainly the equipment followed by the raw ingredients, although a low proportion was traced back to human origin. significance and impact of the study: this work contributes to determine the source of enterococcal contamination in fermented sausages and also to the knowledge of the meat environment.

TI  == assessment of environmental enterococci: bacterial antagonism, pathogenic capacity and antibiotic resistance.
AB  == the properties of 166 environmental strains belonging to the seven enterococcal species were studied. enterococci originated mainly from surface- and waste-waters. they were screened for the presence of enterocins, virulence factors, and antibiotic resistance. the presence of different enterocin genes (enta, entb, entp, ent31, entl50ab) was frequently observed in our enterococcal isolates, 109 strains contained at least one enterocin gene. the distribution of  enterocin genes varied according to the species, the genes were present mainly in e. hirae and e. faecium. by enterocin spot assay, 10 isolates inhibited the growth of listeria strains. to evaluate the pathogenic ability of isolates, the distribution of selected virulence genes (cyla, gele and esp) was investigated, eleven strains were positive in some of these genes, five of them belonged to e.  faecalis. regarding the antibiotic resistance of isolates, only two strains were  multiresistant and two strains (e. hirae and e. casseliflavus) were resistant to  vancomycin.

TI  == prevalence and characterization of enterococcus spp. isolated from brazilian foods.
AB  == enterococci can be used in the food industry as starter or probiotic cultures. however, enterococci are also implicated in severe multi-resistant nosocomial infections. in this study, the prevalence of enterococci in selected brazilian foodstuffs (raw and pasteurized milk, meat products, cheeses and vegetables) was  evaluated. phenotypic and pcr protocols were used for species identification. tests for production of gelatinase, haemolysin, bacteriocin and bile salt hydrolysis were done with all enterococci isolates, whereas molecular determination of virulence markers (genes esp, gel, ace, as, efaa, hyl and cyla)  and antibiotic resistance was checked only for enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis isolates. the antibiotic-resistant isolates were assayed for biofilm formation and adhesion to mammalian cells. from the 120 food samples  analyzed, 52.5% were positive for enterococci, meat and cheese being the most contaminated. e. faecium was the predominant species, followed by e. faecalis, e. casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum. phenotypic tests indicated that 67.7%  of isolates hydrolyzed bile salts, 15.2% produced bacteriocin, 12.0% were beta-hemolytic and 18.2% produced gelatinase. antibiotic resistance (gentamicin,  tetracycline and erythromycin) and genes encoding for virulence traits were more  frequent in e. faecalis than in e. faecium. three e. faecium isolates were resistant to vancomycin. among antibiotic-resistant isolates, 72.4% of e. faecalis were able to form biofilm and 13.8% to adhere to caco-2 cells. antibiotic-resistant e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates were grouped by rapd-pcr and a scattered distribution was noted, indicating that resistance was not related to a particular clone. the spread of virulence/resistance traits in isolates of the two species and different rapd-types suggest the pathogenic potential of both species. by contrast, the recovery of bacteriocinogenic e. faecium isolates with no virulence traits suggests their potential for biotechnological applications. in conclusion, our results showed that enterococci from brazilian foods present important dualist aspects for food safety.

TI  == species distribution and antimicrobial resistance of enterococci isolated from surface and ocean water.
AB  == aims: the species identification and antimicrobial resistance profiles were determined for enterococci isolated from southern california surface and ocean waters. methods and results: species identification was determined for 1413 presumptive enterococcus isolates from urban runoff, bay, ocean and sewage water  samples. the most frequently isolated species were enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus mundtii. all five of these species were isolated from ocean and bay  water with a frequency ranging from 7% to 36%. enterococcus casseliflavus was the most frequently isolated species in urban runoff making up 36-65% of isolates while e. faecium was the most frequently isolated species in sewage making up 53-78% of isolates. the similar distribution of species in urban runoff and receiving water suggests that urban runoff may be the source of enterococcus. no  vancomycin or high level gentamycin resistance was detected in e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates. conclusions: enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, e. casseliflavus and e. mundtii are the most commonly isolated enterococcus species  from urban runoff and receiving waters in southern california. significance and impact of the study: determination of the enterococcus species isolated from receiving waters and potential pollution sources may assist in determining the sources of pollution.

TI  == antibiotic resistance of enterococci in american bison (bison bison) from a nature preserve compared to that of enterococci in pastured cattle.
AB  == enterococci isolated from a bison population on a native tall-grass prairie preserve in kansas were characterized and compared to enterococci isolated from pastured cattle. the species diversity was dominated by enterococcus casseliflavus in bison (62.4%), while enterococcus hirae was the most common isolate from cattle (39.7%). enterococcus faecalis was the second most common species isolated from bison (16%). in cattle, e. faecalis and enterococcus faecium were isolated at lower percentages (3.2% and 1.6%, respectively). no resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, or high levels of vancomycin was detected from either source. tetracycline and erythromycin resistance phenotypes, encoded by teto and ermb, respectively, were common in cattle isolates (42.9% and 12.7%, respectively). a significant percentage of bison isolates (8% and 4%, respectively) were also resistant to these two antibiotics. the tetracycline resistance genes from both bison and cattle isolates resided on mobile genetic elements and showed a transfer frequency of 10(-6) per donor, whereas erythromycin resistance was not transferable. resistance to ciprofloxacin was found to be higher in enterococci from bison (14.4%) than in enterococci isolated from cattle (9.5%). the bison population can serve as a sentinel population for studying the spread and origin of antibiotic resistance.

TI  == genomic typing of enterococci isolated from bovine mammary glands and environmental sources.
AB  == enterococcal isolates (n = 102) from various sources of bovine origin on 1 farm were characterized using pulsed field gel electrophoresis analysis of smai restriction patterns. isolates originated from feed samples (n = 6), bedding samples (n = 15), and bovine quarter-milk samples (n = 81). isolates collected from milk samples included those from high-somatic cell count cows (n = 42), postpartum milk samples (n = 16), and clinical mastitis samples (n = 23). species evaluated included enterococcus faecium (n = 68), enterococcus casseliflavus (n = 29), and enterococcus faecalis (n = 5). a total of 20 clusters representing 44 isolates were detected when a similarity cut-off level of 75% was applied to interpret the pulsed field gel electrophoresis results. fifteen of the clusters contained only isolates from milk samples. four clusters contained isolates from  bedding and milk samples. one cluster contained only isolates from feed samples.  clusters comprised of a single species represented 17 of the 20 total clusters. these results suggest enterococci from bovine origin were genetically diverse, whereas a limited number of isolates from various sources appeared to cluster together.

TI  == comparative analysis of genetic diversity and incidence of virulence factors and  antibiotic resistance among enterococcal populations from raw fruit and vegetable foods, water and soil, and clinical samples.
AB  == a comparative study was carried out among enterococci isolated from fruits and vegetable foods, water and soil, and clinical samples. results indicate strong differences in the numbers of enterococcal species found in different environments as well as their abundance. while enterococcus faecalis was clearly  the predominant species in clinical samples, enterococcus faecium predominated in vegetables, and it slightly outnumbered e. faecalis in water samples. other species (enterococcus hirae, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus durans, enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus) were found more frequently in vegetables, water, and specially in soil. isolates from vegetable foods showed a lower incidence of antibiotic resistance compared to clinical isolates for most antimicrobials tested, especially erythromycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gentamicin and streptomycin for e.  faecalis, and quinupristin/dalfopristin, ampicillin, penicillin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, rifampicin, choramphenicol, gentamicin and nitrofurantoin for e. faecium. e. faecium isolates from vegetable foods and water showed an average lower number of antibiotic resistance traits (2.95 and 3.09 traits for vegetable  and water isolates, respectively) compared to clinical samples (7.5 traits). multi-resistant strains were also frequent among clinical e. faecalis isolates (5.46 traits on average). none of e. faecalis or e. faecium isolates from vegetable foods, water and soil showed beta-haemolytic activity, while 25.64% of  clinical e. faecalis did. a 51.28% of e. faecalis clinical isolates tested positive for the cyla, cylb, cylm set of genes, while some or all of these genes  were missing in the rest of isolates. in clinical e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates, the genetic determinants for the enterococcal surface protein gene (esp), the collagen adhesin gene (ace) and the sex pheromone gene ccf (as well as cob in e. faecalis) showed a clearly higher incidence compared to isolates from other sources. e. faecalis isolates from vegetable foods and water had much lower average numbers of virulence genetic determinants per strain (4.23 and 4.0, respectively) compared to clinical isolates (8.71). similarly, among e. faecium the lowest average number of traits per strain occurred in vegetable food isolates (1.72) followed by water (3.9) and clinical isolates (4.73). length heterogeneity (lh)-pcr typing with espf-acef-ccff and espf-ccff primers revealed  genomic groups that clearly differentiated clinical isolates from those of vegetable foods, water and soil (except for two clinical isolates). the large differences found in the incidence of antibiotic resistance and virulence factors and in the genetic fingerprints determined by lh-pcr suggest a clear separation of hospital-adapted populations of enterococci from those found in open environments.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance profiles of enterococci isolated from poultry meat and pasteurized milk in rio de janeiro, brazil.
AB  == the enterococci are important nosocomial pathogens with a remarkable capacity of  expressing resistance to several antimicrobial agents. their ubiquitous nature and resistance to adverse environmental conditions take account for their ability to colonize different habitats and for their potential for easy spreading through the food chain. in the present study we evaluated the distribution of species and antimicrobial susceptibility among enterococcal isolates recovered from food obtained in retail stores in rio de janeiro, brazil. the following species were identified among 167 isolates obtained from poultry meat and 127 from pasteurized milk: enterococcus faecalis (62.6%), e. casseliflavus (17.3%), e. durans (6.5%),  e. gallinarum (3.0%), e. gilvus (2.4%), e. faecium (2.0%), e. hirae (1.4%), and e. sulfureus (1.0%). the overall percentages of antimicrobial resistant isolates  were: 31.2 % to tetracycline, 23.8% to erythromycin, 11.3% to streptomycin, 4.3%  to chloramphenicol, 3.9% to gentamicin, 1.4% to norfloxacin, 1.1% to imipenem, 0.7% to ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, and penicillin, and 0.4% to ampicillin. intermediate resistance was detected in frequencies varying from 0.5% for linezolid to 58.2% for erythromycin. none of the isolates showed resistance to glycopeptides. high-level resistance to aminoglycosides was observed in 13.1% of  the isolates. multiresistance was observed in e. faecalis, e. casseliflavus, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. durans and e. gilvus.

TI  == biogenic amine-forming microbial communities in cheese.
AB  == the aim of this study was to screen two cheese starter cultures and cheese-borne  microbial communities with the potential to produce biogenic amines in cheese during ripening. bacteria of the genera enterococcus and lactobacillus and coliform bacteria were isolated from dutch-type semi-hard cheese at the beginning of the ripening period. statistically significant counts of bacterial isolates were screened for the presence of specific dna sequences coding for tyrosine decarboxylase (tyrdc) and histidine decarboxylase (hdc) enzymes. the pcr analysis of dna from 14 enterococcus and 3 lactobacillus isolates confirmed the presence of the targetted dna sequences. simultaneously, 13 tyrdc- and 3 hdc-positive isolates were grown in decarboxylase screening medium and this was followed by hplc analysis of the produced tyramine and histamine. conventional and molecular  taxonomic analyses of the above-mentioned isolates identified the following species: enterococcus durans (7 strains), enterococcus faecalis (3 strains), enterococcus faecium (1 strain), enterococcus casseliflavus (3 strains), lactobacillus curvatus (1 strain), lactobacillus lactis (1 strain) and lactobacillus helveticus (1 strain). all of the above enterococcus and two of the lactobacillus strains originated from contaminating microbial communities. the l. helveticus strain, which was tyrosine decarboxylase-positive and exhibited tyramine production, originated from starter culture 1 used for cheese production. comparison of partial tyrdc sequences of positive enterococcus isolates revealed 89% sequence similarity, and that of hdc-positive lactobacillus isolates revealed 99% sequence similarity.

TI  == assessment of safety of enterococci isolated throughout traditional terrincho cheesemaking: virulence factors and antibiotic susceptibility.
AB  == enterococci account for an important fraction of the adventitious microflora of traditional cheeses manufactured in mediterranean countries from small ruminants' raw milk and play an important role in the development of suitable organoleptic characteristics of the final product. it has been suggested that animals used for food or animals that supply edible products are a reservoir of antibiotic-resistant enterococci. the main purpose of this research effort was thus to identify, to the species level, a total of 73 enterococci with high tolerance to acidic ph and bile salts (as prevailing environmental conditions in  the first portion of the gastrointestinal tract), which were previously isolated  from the milk feedstock to the final product of terrincho cheesemaking, and to determine their profiles of antibiotic susceptibility, coupled with the occurrence of specific virulence factors (especially in those that might eventually be claimed to exhibit suitable probiotic and technological performances). isolates, identified by both api 20 strep and pcr methods, were found to belong to the following enterococcus species: e. casseliflavus, e. durans, e. faecalis, e. faecium, and e. gallinarum. susceptibility of those isolates was observed to most antibiotics tested, whereas none harbored aminoglycoside resistance genes. pcr screenings for cytolysin genes (cyll(l), cyll(s), cylm, cylb, and cyla), surface adhesin genes (efaa(fs), efaa(fm), and esp), the aggregation protein gene (agg), and the extracellular metalloendopeptidase gene (gele) were performed. all isolates proved negative for cyll(l), cylm, cylb, and agg genes. both e. faecalis strains were positive for the cell wall-associated protein esp and the cell wall adhesin efaa(fs), whereas  the cell wall adhesin efaa(fm) was detected in 11 of the 12 e. faecium strains. only one strain possessed the cyll(s) determinant, and another possessed the cyla gene. incidence of virulence determinants was thus very low; hence, the enterococcal adventitious microflora tested is essentially safe.

TI  == high prevalence of tetracycline resistance in enterococcus isolates from broilers carrying the erm(b) gene.
AB  == a total of 73 isolates of enterococcus spp. carrying the erm(b) gene were obtained from cloacal swabs of broiler chickens derived from 13 different farms in belgium. the erm(b) gene encodes resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin b antibiotics (mls(b)). the isolates belonged to eight different species: enterococcus avium (eight isolates), enterococcus casseliflavus (11 isolates), enterococcus cecorum (eight isolates), enterococcus durans (seven isolates), enterococcus faecalis (10 isolates), enterococcus faecium (17 isolates), enterococcus gallinarum (seven isolates) and enterococcus hirae (five  isolates). acquired resistance to tetracycline was detected in 68 of the isolates, and in 62 of these it was associated with the presence of the resistance genes tet(l), tet(m), tet(o) or tet(s). in three e. faecium isolates that were phenotypically susceptible to tetracycline, tet(l) or tet(m) was present. the transposon integrase gene (int gene) of the tn916/tn1545 transposon  family was detected in 18 of the 54 isolates that contained the tet(m) gene. it was concluded that acquired resistance to tetracycline antibiotics is often present in enterococci from poultry carrying the erm(b) gene. the use of tetracyclines in poultry may therefore co-select for resistance to mls(b) antibiotics, which may be important as alternative therapy for enterococcal infections in humans.

TI  == enterococcal colonization of infants in a neonatal intensive care unit: associated predictors, risk factors and seasonal patterns.
AB  == background: during and shortly after birth, newborn infants are colonized with enterococci. this study analyzes predictors for early enterococcal colonization of infants in a neonatal intensive care unit and describes risk factors associated with multidrugresistant enterococci colonization and its seasonal patterns. methods: over a 12-month period, we performed a prospective epidemiological study in 274 infants admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit.  on the first day of life, we compared infants with enterococcal isolates detected in meconium or body cultures to those without. we then tested the association of  enterococcal colonization with peripartal predictors/risk factors by using bivariate and multivariate statistical methods. results: twenty-three percent of  the infants were colonized with enterococci. the three most common enterococcal species were e. faecium (48% of isolates), e. casseliflavus (25%) and e. faecalis (13%). fifty-seven percent of the enterococci found were resistant to three of five antibiotic classes, but no vancomycin-resistant isolates were observed. during winter/spring months, the number of enterococci and multidrug-resistant enterococci were higher than in summer/fall months (p = 0.002 and p < 0.0001, respectively). with respect to enterococcal colonization on the first day of life, predictors were prematurity (p = 0.043) and low birth weight (p = 0.011). with respect to colonization with multidrug-resistant enterococci, risk factors were prematurity (p = 0.0006), low birth weight (p < 0.0001) and prepartal antibiotic treatment (p = 0.019). using logistic regression, we determined that gestational age was the only parameter significantly correlated with multidrug-resistant enterococci colonization. no infection with enterococci or multidrugresistant enterococci in the infants was detected. the outcome of infants with and without enterococcal colonization was the same with respect to death, necrotizing enterocolitis, intracerebral hemorrhage and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. conclusion: in neonatal intensive care units, an infant's susceptibility to early colonization with enterococci in general, and his or her  risk for colonization with multidrug-resistant enterococci in particular, is increased in preterm newborns, especially during the winter/spring months. the prepartal use of antibiotics with no known activity against enterococci appears to increase the risk for colonization with multidrug-resistant enterococci.

AB  == the influx of enterococcal antibiotic resistance (ar) and virulence genes from ready-to-eat food (rtef) to the human digestive tract was assessed. three rtefs (chicken salad, chicken burger, and carrot cake) were sampled from five fast-food restaurants five times in summer (su) and winter (wi). the prevalence of enterococci was significantly higher in su (92.0% of salad samples and 64.0% of burger samples) than in wi (64.0% of salad samples and 24.0% of burger samples).  the overall concentrations of enterococci during the two seasons were similar ( approximately 10(3) cfu/g); the most prevalent were enterococcus casseliflavus (41.5% of isolates) and enterococcus hirae (41.5%) in wi and enterococcus faecium (36.8%), e. casseliflavus (27.6%), and enterococcus faecalis (22.4%) in su. resistance in wi was detected primarily to tetracycline (50.8%), ciprofloxacin (13.8%), and erythromycin (4.6%). su isolates were resistant mainly to tetracycline (22.8%), erythromycin (22.1%), and kanamycin (13.0%). the most common tet gene was tet(m) (35.4% of wi isolates and 11.9% of su isolates). the prevalence of virulence genes (gele, asa1, cyla, and esp) and marker genes for clinical isolates (ef_0573, ef_0592, ef_0605, ef_1420, ef_2144, and pathogenicity island ef_0050) was low (< or =12.3%). genotyping of e. faecalis and e. faecium using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed that the food contamination likely originated from various sources and that it was not clonal. our conservative estimate (single ar gene copy per cell) for the influx of tet genes  alone to the human digestive tract is 3.8 x 10(5) per meal (chicken salad). this  ar gene influx is frequent because rtefs are commonly consumed and that may play  a role in the acquisition of ar determinants in the human digestive tract.

TI  == [vancomycin and high-level aminoglycoside resistant enterococcus carriage and the risk factors related to resistance in hospitalized patients].
AB  == the aims of this study were to detect the prevalence of fecal vancomycin resistant enterococcus (vre) colonization with high-level resistance to aminoglycoside and other antibiotics and, the risk factors related to resistance  in hospitalized patients in duzce medical faculty hospital, turkey. a total of 105 patients (61 from internal medicine, 44 from surgery clinics; 54.3% female, mean age: 47.2 +/- 24.54 years) were included to the study and a single stool sample was collected from each of the patients. specimens were cultivated in enterococcus selective media (biomerieux, france), and the isolates were identified by conventional microbiological methods together with the api 20 strep test. beta-lactamase activities of the isolates were tested with nitrocefin disk, and antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by the disk diffusion method. enterococcus spp. were isolated from 81 (77%) of the patients' samples and 60.5%  were identified as e. faecium, 13.6% as e. faecalis, 11.1% as e. gallinarum, 7.4% as e. durans, 2.5% as e. raffinosus, 2.5% as e. mundtii, 1.2% as e. casseliflavus, and 1.2% as e. avium. high-level streptomycin and gentamicin resistance rates were found in 19.8% and 9.9% of the isolates, respectively. the  resistance rates for the other antibiotics were found as follows; 18.5% to ampicillin, 27.2% to penicilin, 34.6% to nitrofurantoin, 65.4% to norfloxacin, and 70.4% to both tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. no vancomycin resistance was detected, and none of the enterococci had beta-lactamase activity. long hospitalization period, antibiotic usage and experience of intra-abdominal operation were found as the significant risk factors for colonization of the resistant bacteria. our results demonstrated that there was no fecal vre carriage in our hospital during the study period, however, it was concluded that the screening tests should be done periodically in order to detect resistant strains  as soon as possible.

TI  == prevalence, identification and distribution of various species of enterococci isolated from clinical specimens with special reference to urinary tract infection in catheterized patients.
AB  == various clinical specimens were processed to find the prevalence rate of enterococci and to identify the species of clinical isolates of enterococci. screening of various clinical specimens revealed that enterococci were prevalent  in 22.19% of the total specimens, with foley's catheters and burn wounds to be the major site of isolation. high rate of colonization was noted as opposed to infection. conventional test scheme proposed by facklam and collins were successfully used to speciate enterococcal strains. seven species of enterococci  were identified in the study from a set of 202 cultures, with e.faecalis (49.50%) and e. faecium (35.64%) predominating. e. avium (9.40%), e. hirae (2.47%), e. raffinosus (1.98%) and one isolate each of e.gallinarum and e. casseliflavus were the other members of enterococcus species identified. urinary tract infection (uti) by enterococci due to catherisation was found in 8.92% of the patients and  is probably the result of high rate of colonization of foley's catheters and use  of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

TI  == epidemiology and molecular characterization of vancomycin resistant enterococci isolates in india.
AB  == little attention has been paid to the problem of the spread of vancomycin resistant enterococci (vre) in india. between august 2002 to march 2003, faecal and urine samples of patients from various wards of the postgraduate institute of medical education and research, chandigarh, india, were screened for vancomycin resistance. 36 vre were isolated (18 enterococcus gallinarum, 9 e. casseliflavus, 7 e. faecium and 2 e. faecalis). these isolates were characterized as low-, moderate- and high-level resistant strains by phenotypic as well as genotypic methods such as minimum inhibitory concentration determination, polymerase chain  reaction assays, sequencing of pcr products and multiple sequence alignment of van genes. correlations established between these results and the vancomycin resistance markers were designated as vana (783 bp), vanb (635 bp), vanc1 (822 bp) and vanc2 (484 bp) according to the findings of earlier workers as well as comparison with existing databases. prolonged hospital stay and vancomycin were important risk factors for both vre uti and colonization. renal dialysis, renal failure, prior aminoglycoside and third generation cephalosporin were the other significant factors for vre uti. the study also highlights the importance of screening for vre in clinical samples and recommends the institution of control measures to prevent the further spread of vre.

TI  == prevalence of streptogramin resistance in enterococci from animals: identification of vatd from animal sources in the usa.
AB  == there is considerable debate over the contribution of virginiamycin use in animals to quinupristin/dalfopristin (q/d) resistance in humans. in this study, the prevalence and mechanisms of streptogramin resistance in enterococci from animals and the environment were investigated. from 2000-2004, enterococci from samples were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. q/d-resistant isolates (minimum inhibitory concentration >or=4 microg/ml) were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using primers for streptogramin resistance genes (ermb, msrc, vatd and vate). from the analysis, 1029/6227 (17%) q/d-resistant non-enterococcus faecalis enterococci were identified. the majority of q/d-resistant isolates were enterococcus hirae (n=349; 34%), enterococcus casseliflavus (n=271; 26%) and enterococcus faecium (n=259; 25%). using pcr, 55.5% (n=571) were positive for ermb, 3% (n=34) for msrc, 2% (n=20) for vate and  0.3% (n=3) for vatd; 39% (n=401) were negative for all four genes. the vatd-positive samples comprised two e. faecium from chicken and one e. hirae from swine. the nucleotide sequence of vatd from the three isolates was 100% homologous to published vatd sequences. these data indicate that q/d resistance among enterococci from animals remains low despite the long history of virginiamycin use. to date, this is the first report of vatd from enterococci in  animals in the usa.

TI  == molecular identification and diversity of enterococci isolated from slovak bryndza cheese.
AB  == three hundred and eight presumed enterococcal isolates were recovered from bryndza, a soft sheep milk cheese. the cheese samples were obtained from five different commercial distributors in slovakia and were taken at three different seasonal intervals. all isolates were identified to the species level using genotypic tools. species-specific pcr using ddl genes highlighted the predominance of enterococcus faecium (176 isolates) and assigned 50 isolates to the species enterococcus faecalis. the remaining 82 isolates were classified using repetitive element sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with primer (gtg)(5)-(gtg)(5)-pcr, in combination with phenylalanyl-trna synthase gene (phes) sequence analysis and by whole-cell protein analysis (sds-page). these strains were identified as enterococcus durans (59 strains), enterococcus italicus (8 strains), enterococcus casseliflavus (3 strains), enterococcus gallinarum (3 strains), enterococcus hirae (1 strain), and 8 strains were members of the species lactococcus lactis. of the seven enterococcal species isolated, three of them, e. durans, e. faecalis and e. faecium were present in all samples  studied, with e. faecium as the predominant one. the precise identification of enterococci in bryndza cheese is an essential step in the process of evaluation of their functional properties which will be further studied and assessed.

TI  == use of the phoenix automated system for identification of streptococcus and enterococcus spp.
AB  == the phoenix system (becton dickinson diagnostic systems, sparks, md) was evaluated for identification (id) to the species level of streptococci and enterococci. two hundred clinical isolates were investigated: beta-hemolytic streptococci (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae organisms (n = 46), viridans group streptococci (n = 31), enterococcus faecium (n = 36), enterococcus faecalis (n = 25), and other catalase-negative cocci (n = 12). the api system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) was used as a comparator. molecular methods (sequencing of 16s rrna and zwf and gki genes and ddl gene amplification) were used to investigate discordant results. upon resolution of discrepancies, correct species id was achieved by the phoenix system for 121/129 (93.8%) streptococci and 63/70  (90.0%) enterococci. excellent results were obtained for s. pneumoniae (45/45) and beta-hemolytic streptococci (49/50). with regard to viridans streptococci, the accuracy of the phoenix system was 83.9%. among the latter organisms, the best performance was obtained with isolates of the streptococcus sanguinis group  and streptococcus anginosus group; problems were instead encountered with the streptococcus mitis group. four e. faecium and three e. faecalis isolates were misidentified as enterococcus casseliflavus/enterococcus gallinarum or enterococcus durans. thus, these isolates were identified only at the genus level. compared with commercially available systems, the phoenix system appears a reliable diagnostic tool for identifying clinically relevant streptococci and enterococci. the smic/id-2 panel proved particularly effective for beta-hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci.

AB  == the presented study aims at analyzing an increasing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) isolated from various kinds of clinical material obtained from patients in the department of hemato-oncology (dho), university hospital in olomouc, czech republic. between january 1 and march 31, 2005, enterococci were isolated by standard microbiological procedures using both clinical material obtained from hospitalized patients and samples from the department environment. resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin was determined by a standardized microdilution method. phenotype determination of resistance to  vancomycin was verified by pcr detection of vana and vanb genes. in vana enterococcus faecium, macrorestriction analysis was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. during the monitored period, a total of 128 enterococcus sp. strains were isolated, of which 38 (30 %) isolates from 22 different patients were determined as vre. dominating were enterococcus faecium vana (63 %) and enterococcus casseliflavus vanc (16 %) strains. at the same time, one enterococcus faecium vana strain was acquired from a bed-side table used by a patient in whom a similar strain had been isolated repeatedly from various clinical materials including a rectal swab taken in 2004. based on the macrorestriction analysis of genome dna in 24 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium vana strains isolated from the patients' clinical material, one strain from the bed-side table surface and one strain isolated from stools in 2004, 8 unique restriction profiles with similarity ranging from 90 % to 100 % were identified, which could be classified into 3 clonal types. thus, we can assume not only the endogenous origin of the vre in hemato-oncological patients and their potential selection caused by therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics but also the ability of the strains to survive in a hospital setting and, subsequently, to be spread clonally by various vectors.

TI  == assessment of two commercial susceptibility test methods for determination of daptomycin mics.
AB  == daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic with activity against several important gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including drug-resistant staphylococci and enterococci. because the mechanism of action of daptomycin is calcium-dependent depolarization of the cell membrane, susceptibility testing requires medium supplemented with a physiological level of calcium. this study assessed two food  and drug administration-cleared commercial test devices for determination of daptomycin mics, etest and justone. a collection of 220 selected isolates, including staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, e. avium, e. durans, e. casseliflavus, and e. gallinarum, were tested by both methods. included in the collection were 22 s. aureus and 14  enterococcus sp. isolates that were recovered from patients and were nonsusceptible on the basis of the daptomycin mics. as the reference method for comparison, all isolates were tested by the clinical and laboratory standards institute broth microdilution method incorporating cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth with 50 microg/ml calcium. daptomycin mics agreed, within 1 twofold dilution, for 97% of the isolates by etest and for 100% by justone. however, daptomycin mics determined by etest were 1 dilution lower than the reference mics for 65% of the enterococcus sp. isolates tested. this resulted in 28.5% very major (vm) errors (4/14) with enterococci (all e. faecium) but none (0/22) with staphylococci. use of justone yielded mics that were 1 dilution lower than the reference mics for 69% of the staphylococci and 25% of the enterococci. this resulted in 13.6% vm errors (3/22) with staphylococci and 14.3% vm errors (2/14)  with enterococci. the manufacturer-recommended justone inoculum preparation resulted in mean colony counts of only 5 x 10(4) to 1 x 10(5) cfu/ml in the wells of the strip. increasing the inoculum to 3 x 10(5) to 4 x 10(5) cfu/ml eliminated two of five vm errors upon retesting. no major interpretive errors occurred with  either device. in summary, daptomycin mics generated by the etest or justone method generally agreed within 1 dilution of the reference daptomycin mics. however, both devices produced slightly lower mics that resulted in some vm errors.

TI  == ecology of antibiotic resistance genes: characterization of enterococci from houseflies collected in food settings.
AB  == in this project, enterococci from the digestive tracts of 260 houseflies (musca domestica l.) collected from five restaurants were characterized. houseflies frequently (97% of the flies were positive) carried enterococci (mean, 3.1 x 10(3) cfu/fly). using multiplex pcr, 205 of 355 randomly selected enterococcal isolates were identified and characterized. the majority of these isolates were enterococcus faecalis (88.2%); in addition, 6.8% were e. faecium, and 4.9% were e. casseliflavus. e. faecalis isolates were phenotypically resistant to tetracycline (66.3%), erythromycin (23.8%), streptomycin (11.6%), ciprofloxacin (9.9%), and kanamycin (8.3%). tetracycline resistance in e. faecalis was encoded  by tet(m) (65.8%), tet(o) (1.7%), and tet(w) (0.8%). the majority (78.3%) of the  erythromycin-resistant e. faecalis isolates carried erm(b). the conjugative transposon tn916 and members of the tn916/tn1545 family were detected in 30.2% and 34.6% of the identified isolates, respectively. e. faecalis carried virulence genes, including a gelatinase gene (gele; 70.7%), an aggregation substance gene (asa1; 33.2%), an enterococcus surface protein gene (esp; 8.8%), and a cytolysin  gene (cyla; 8.8%). phenotypic assays showed that 91.4% of the isolates with the gele gene were gelatinolytic and that 46.7% of the isolates with the asa1 gene aggregated. all isolates with the cyla gene were hemolytic on human blood. this study showed that houseflies in food-handling and -serving facilities carry antibiotic-resistant and potentially virulent enterococci that have the capacity  for horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes to other bacteria.

AB  == in the present study, a total of 455 enterococcal isolates, recovered from patients living in the city of porto alegre, state of rio grande do sul, brazil,  during the period from july 1996 to june 1997, were identified to the species level by conventional biochemical and microbiological tests, and assayed for their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. the genetic diversity of antimicrobial resistant strains was evaluated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) analysis of smai restricted chromosomal dna. the most frequent species was enterococcus faecalis (92.8%). other species identified were: e. faecium (2.9%),  e. gallinarum (1.5%), e. avium (1.1%), e. hirae (0.7%), e. casseliflavus (0.4%),  e. durans (0.4%) and e. raffinosus (0.2%). the overall prevalence of isolates with high-level resistance (hlr) to aminoglycosides was 37.8%. hlr to gentamicin  was found in 24.8%. no strains with acquired resistance to vancomycin were found. pfge analysis showed the predominance of clonal group a, comprising strains isolated from different clinical specimens obtained from patients in three hospitals. these results suggest intra and inter-hospital dissemination of one predominant clonal group of e. faecalis isolates with hlr to gentamicin in the hospitals included in this study.

TI  == clinical glycopeptide-resistant enterococci isolated from patients after solid organ transplantation.
AB  == the aim of this study was to confirm the identification and resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin of nosocomial enterococcal strains using molecular biology methods. glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (gre) strains were isolated from clinical specimens of hospitalized patients. bacterial identification was performed in an automatic atb expression system (biomerieux sa). susceptibility to glycopeptides was determined by the disc diffusion method and etest (ab biodisk, sweden). we performed polymerase chain reactions (pcr) for enterococcus  faecium and e. faecalis identification and van genes detection. fifteen gre strains were cultured over 2 years (2003-2004). fourteen isolates were highly resistant to vancomycin (mic range, 128->256 mg/l) and teicoplanin (mic range, 32->256 mg/l). twelve strains harbored van a gene (van a phenotype). seven isolates were identified as e. faecium and seven as e. faecalis by the multiplex-pcr method. one strain-e. casseliflavus-showed low resistance to vancomycin (mic 8 mg/l) with retained susceptibility to teicoplanin (mic 4 mg/l). it harbored the van c2/c3 gene and was identified as the van c2/c3 phenotype. gre strains were more often isolated from hospitalized patients in poland. constant monitoring by reliable microbiological methods has become necessary to prevent the spread of these strains in the hospital environment.

TI  == risk factors and outcomes associated with non-enterococcus faecalis, non-enterococcus faecium enterococcal bacteremia.
AB  == objectives: to compare risk factors, clinical features, and outcomes in patients  with enterococcus avium, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus durans, enterococcus gallinarum, and enterococcus mundtii bacteremia (cases) with those in patients with enterococcus faecalis bacteremia (controls). design: a retrospective case-control study. setting: a 725-bed, university-affiliated, academic medical center. patients: the clinical microbiology database at northwestern memorial hospital from january 1994 to may 2003 was searched to identify cases; each case was matched to one control on the basis of date of admission. results: thirty-three cases were identified and matched with 33 controls. the mean duration of hospital stay was longer (29.7 vs 17.2 days; p = .03) and the mean time to acquisition of bacteremia was greater (16.5 vs 6.3 days; p = .003) for cases than controls. cases were more likely to have underlying hematologic malignancies (p < .001), to have been treated with corticosteroids (p = .02), and to be neutropenic (p = .003). controls were more likely to have an indwelling bladder catheter (p = .01), and cases were more likely to have the gastrointestinal tract as a source of infection (p = .007) and to have concurrent cholangitis (p = .002). there were no differences in severity  of illness or in mortality rates. conclusions: compared with patients with e. faecalis bacteremia, patients with non-e. faecalis, non-enterococcus faecium enterococcal bacteremia were more likely to have a hematologic malignancy, prior  treatment with corticosteroids, neutropenia, and cholangitis; longer duration of  hospital stay was also identified as a clinical feature. however, non-e. faecalis, non-e. faecium species are not associated with any differences in mortality.

TI  == partial characterization of enterocin mr99 from a corn silage isolate of enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == aims: to assess the inhibitory activity on gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of several species of enterococci recovered from a natural corn silage.  methods and results: the inhibitory activity of strains of enterococcus faecalis  (58), enterococcus faecium (35), enterococcus gallinarum (3) and enterococcus casseliflavus (4) were studied employing indicator strains from various sources (clinical, food and atcc). enterococcus faecalis mr99, the only strain with inhibitory activity, inhibited other enterococci, listeria spp., staphylococcus aureus, clostridium spp., bacillus spp., escherichia coli, shigella sonnei and shigella flexneri. the bacterium contained only one conjugative pheromone-responsive plasmid. the partially chromatography-purified mr99 enterocin (ppe) had a molecular weight of approx. 5000 da and a pi of 6.2, was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and could be extracted in benzene and butanol. it appeared stable to adjustment of ph 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0 and was resistant to heat. inactivation was at 15 min at 121 degrees c. enterocin mr99 was bactericidal on strains of listeria monocytogenes, staph. aureus, and bovine  mastitis agents, it was bacteriostatic on e. coli. although enterocins mr99 and as48 have inhibitory activity on gram-negative bacilli, pcr studies demonstrated  a lack of relationship between them. conclusions: the active component had a protein nature, was resistant to heat and presented a wide inhibitory spectrum. significance and impact of the study: the biological properties of ent. faecalis  mr99 suggest that this strain merits further investigations so it can be applied  in human and veterinary health programmes.

TI  == validation of vitek 2 version 4.01 software for detection, identification, and classification of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci.
AB  == we evaluated the ability of the new vitek 2 version 4.01 software to identify and detect glycopeptide-resistant enterococci compared to that of the reference broth microdilution method and to classify them into the vana, vanb, vanc1, and vanc2 genotypes. moreover, the accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility testing with agents with improved potencies against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci was determined. a total of 121 enterococci were investigated. the new vitek 2 software was able to identify 114 (94.2%) enterococcal strains correctly to the species level and to classify 119 (98.3%) enterococci correctly to the glycopeptide resistance genotype level. one enterococcus casseliflavus strain and six enterococcus faecium vana strains with low-level resistance to vancomycin were identified with low discrimination, requiring additional tests. one of the vana strains was misclassified as the vanb type, and one glycopeptide-susceptible e. facium wild type was misclassified as the vana type. the overall essential agreements for antimicrobial susceptibility testing results were 94.2% for vancomycin, 95.9% for teicoplanin, 100% for quinupristin-dalfopristin and moxifloxacin, and 97.5% for linezolid. the rates of minor errors were 9% for teicoplanin and 5% for the other antibiotic agents. the identification and susceptibility data were produced within 4 h to 6 h 30 min and 8 h 15 min to 12 h 15 min. in conclusion, use of vitek 2 version 4.01 software appears to be a reliable method for the identification and detection of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci as well as an improvement over the use of the former vitek 2 database. however, a significant reduction in the detection time would be desirable.

TI  == microbiological study of lactic acid fermentation of caper berries by molecular and culture-dependent methods.
AB  == fermentation of capers (the fruits of capparis sp.) was studied by molecular and  culture-independent methods. a lactic acid fermentation occurred following immersion of caper berries in water, resulting in fast acidification and development of the organoleptic properties typical of this fermented food. a collection of 133 isolates obtained at different times of fermentation was reduced to 75 after randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis. isolates were identified by pcr or 16s rrna gene sequencing as lactobacillus plantarum (37 isolates), lactobacillus paraplantarum (1 isolate), lactobacillus pentosus (5 isolates), lactobacillus brevis (9 isolates), lactobacillus fermentum (6 isolates), pediococcus pentosaceus (14 isolates), pediococcus acidilactici (1  isolate), and enterococcus faecium (2 isolates). cluster analysis of rapd-pcr patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among lactobacilli (with four major  groups and five subgroups), while pediococci clustered in two closely related groups. a culture-independent analysis of fermentation samples by temporal temperature gradient electrophoresis (ttge) also indicated that l. plantarum is the predominant species in this fermentation, in agreement with culture-dependent results. the distribution of l. brevis and l. fermentum in samples was also determined by ttge, but identification of pediococcus at the species level was not possible. ttge also allowed a more precise estimation of the distribution of  e. faecium, and the detection of enterococcus casseliflavus (which was not revealed by the culture-dependent analysis). results from this study indicate that complementary data from molecular and culture-dependent analysis provide a more accurate determination of the microbial community dynamics during caper fermentation.

TI  == occurrence of antibiotic resistant enterococci in clinical specimens from a pediatric hospital.
AB  == enterococcal infection has become a major clinical problem and e. faecalis and e. faecium are the most frequently isolated species. however, the isolation of other species (e. casseliflavus, e. gallinarum, e. durans) from clinical materials was  reported recently. the aim of this study was to evaluate drug resistance of 97 species of enterococci isolated from clinical specimens of upper silesian health  center of child and mother in katowice. each strain was tested for susceptibility to vancomycin, teicoplanin, aminoglycosides (gentamycin and streptomycin) and synercid (quinupristine/ dalfopristine) by the e-test method. fifty three percent of studied enterococci demonstrated high level aminoglycoside resistance (hlar) (mic > 1024 microg/ml). sixty three strains of e. faecalis were sensitive to vancomycin (mic 1-4 microg/ml), but 5 strains demonstrated low sensitivity (3 strains with mic = 6 microg/ml and 2 strains with mic = 24 microg/ml). all studied enterococci were sensitive to teicoplanin (mic < 2 microg/ml). a high percentage of e. faecium (70%) resistant to synercid was demonstrated (mic = 2-24 microg/ml). infection control and monitoring of antibiotic sensitivity among isolated hospital strains may prevent the transmission of resistant strains in a  pediatric hospital.

TI  == detection of a novel aph(2") allele (aph[2"]-ie) conferring high-level gentamicin resistance and a spectinomycin resistance gene ant(9)-ia (aad 9) in clinical isolates of enterococci.
AB  == aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (ames) are major factors that confer aminoglycoside resistance to enterococci. in an epidemiologic study on distribution of 12 ame genes in 534 recent clinical strains isolated from a japanese hospital, two uncommon ame genes, ant(9)-ia and a novel aph(2") allele,  aph(2")-ie, were detected. ant(9)-ia had been reported only in staphylococcus aureus and encodes spectinomycin adenylyltransferase ant(9)-i, which confers resistance to spectinomycin. the ant(9)-ia gene was detected in three strains, a  single strain each of enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and e. avium. nucleotide sequences of ant(9)-ia from these three enterococcal species were identical to that reported for s. aureus and considered to be located on tn 554. the new aph(2") allele, designated aph(2")-ie, was identified in three e. faecium strains. the aph(2")-ie allele was genetically close to aph(2")-id reported in e. casseliflavus (93.7% amino acid sequence identity; 96.3% similarity), while distant from aph(2")-ia, aph(2")-ib, or aph(2")-ic (26.3-29.5% amino acid sequence identity). sequence divergence between aph(2")-id and aph(2")-ie was mostly located in amino-terminal half. in contrast, sequences corresponding to the three motifs required for aminoglycoside phosphotransferase were conserved except for a single amino acid. three e. faecium strains having aph(2")-ie showed high-level resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin, but not to kanamycin, dibekacin, and tobramycin, unlike enzyme specificity described for aph(2")-id in  e. casseliflavus. such a difference in resistance phenotype was suggested to be related to amino acid sequence divergence between aph(2")-id and aph(2")-ie.

TI  == virulence of enterococcus isolates collected in lower silesia (poland).
AB  == 148 enterococcal strains: e.faecalis (108), e.faecium (35), e.gallinarum (3), e.casseliflavus (1) and e.durans (1) from various clinical specimens were investigated for their ability to adhere to caco-2 and hep-2 cell lines, and also for the presence of the esp gene, biofilm formation, production of haemolysins, dnase and lipase. several types of enterococcal adhesion to both cell lines were  noted. an aggregative adherence was the most frequent among e.faecalis and e.faecium isolates. other species presented various adhesive types. the occurrence of virulence factors in the whole group of strains was as follows: esp gene in 53.4%, biofilm in 45.3%, haemolysins in 15.5%, dnase in 12.2% and lipase  in 33.1% of enterococcal isolates. it appears that the adherence of the enterococci studied was not significantly associated with the presence of virulence factors.

TI  == enumeration and speciation of enterococci found in marine and intertidal sediments and coastal water in southern california.
AB  == aims: to determine the levels and species distribution of enterococci in intertidal and marine sediments and coastal waters at two beaches frequently in violation of bacterial water standards. methods and results: faecal indicator bacteria were extracted from sediment and enumerated using membrane filtration. high levels of enterococci were detected in intertidal sediments in a seasonal river and near a storm drain outlet. low levels were found in marine sediments at 10 m depths and in surf zone sand. bacterial isolates presumptively identified as enterococcus on mei media were speciated. the predominant species found in both water and sediment included enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus mundtii. a number of isolates (11-26%) from regulatory water samples presumptively identified as enterococci on mei media were subsequently identified as species other than enterococcus. at both study sites, the distribution of species present in water was comparable with those in sediments and the distribution of species was similar in water samples passing and exceeding bacterial indicator standards. conclusions: high levels of enterococcus in intertidal sediments indicate retention and possible regrowth in this environment. significance and impact of the study: resuspension of enterococci that are persistent in sediments may cause beach water quality failures and calls into question the specificity of this indicator for determining recent faecal contamination.

TI  == [vca agar (biomerieux) for selective isolation of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) from fecal specimens].
AB  == screening for vancomycin resistant enterococci (vre) is recommended for preventing nosocomial infections with vre. the aim of this study was to assess the performance of vca3 agar (biomerieux) in vre isolation from fecal specimens.  220 specimens were cultured on vca3 agar, which contains vancomycin and in parallel, on cap agar (oxoid), which is vancomycin-free. 36 vancomycin resistant  enterococci were isolated: 24 isolates of enterococcus faecium expressed a high-level resistance to vancomycin and 12 isolates of e. gallinarum/casseliflavus exhibited resistance at low-level. the sensitivity of vca3 appeared greater than that of cap for vre isolation: 92% (22/24) vs 79% (19/24) for e. faecium (ns, p>0.05) ; 83% (10/12) vs 50% (6/12) for e. gallinarum/casselliflavus (ns, p>0.05). as expected, initial cultures of multiple gram positive organisms were far more frequent on cap agar than on vca3 agar. the isolation rate of vancomycin susceptible gram positive strains was impressively lower on vca3 medium than on cap medium. vca3 agar avoided therefore additional subcultures, useless identification and susceptibility tests. in conclusion, vca3 medium could be useful for the direct, rapid and selective isolation of vre from  fecal specimens.

TI  == prevalence and molecular epidemiology of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) strains isolated from animals and humans in korea.
AB  == background: to assess the possibility of vre transmission from animals to humans, we studied the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) in farm animals, raw chicken meat, and healthy people. we then determined the molecular relatedness of vre isolates between animals and humans in korea. methods: we aimed to isolate vre from 150 enterococci specimens of farm animals, 15 raw chicken meat samples, and stools from 200 healthy people. species differentiation was done with conventional biochemical tests. vancomycin resistance genotyping was done by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). using the agar dilution method, antimicrobial susceptibility was tested for 8 antimicrobials and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) was done to evaluate the molecular relatedness of vre isolates. results: the prevalence of vre was 14.7% (22/150) in farm animal specimens, 1% (2/200) in healthy people, and 60% (9/15) in raw chicken meat. of 22 animal vre isolates, 1 vana e. faecium, 15 vanc1 e. gallinarum, and 6 vanc2 e. casseliflavus were identified. all of the 9 vre from raw chicken meat and all of  the 20 clinical vre strains were vana e. faecium. however, in healthy people, only 2 vanc2 e. casseliflavus were isolated. these showed low-level resistance to vancomycin and susceptibility to teicoplanin. however, 9 vre strains from raw chicken meat had high-level resistance to vancomycin (mic(50,90): >128 microg/ml), teicoplanin (mic(50,90): >128 microg/ml), ampicillin (mic(50,90): >128 nicrog/ml), erythromycin (mic(50.90): >128 microg/ml), and tetracycline (mic(50/90): 128/>128 microg/ml). conclusion: this study demonstrated little evidence of vre colonization in healthy people despite high recovery of vre among raw chicken meat. it is suggested that there is little evidence of vre transmission from animals to healthy people. however, we assumed that there exists the possibility of vre contamination during the processing of chicken meat.

TI  == contribution of enterococci to the spread of antibiotic resistance in the production chain of swine meat commodities.
AB  == thirty-six samples, including fecal specimens, dry feedstuffs, raw and processed  pork meat products, and dry fermented sausages, were collected from two production chains of swine meat commodities and analyzed for the presence of 11 antibiotic resistance (ar) genes. specific pcr assays carried out on dna extracted directly from the samples revealed a high incidence of the genes tet(k) (80.5%), ermb (66.7%), and tet(m) (66.7%). feces and feedstuffs gave the largest  number of positive amplifications. to elucidate the contribution of enterococci to the occurrence and spread of ar, 146 resistant enterococci were isolated, and  their identity, genetic fingerprints, and ar gene profiles were determined by means of molecular techniques. enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium were the predominant isolated species (43.8 and 38.4%, respectively); other enterococcus species identified were e. durans (8.9%), e. hirae (2.7%), e. gallinarum (2.1%), e. mundtii (2.1%), and e. casseliflavus (2.1%). a number of isolates displayed a complex ar gene profile comprising up to four different resistance determinants. the genes tet(m) and ermb were highly diffused, being present in 86.9 and 84.9%, respectively, of the isolates. the application of amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting was particularly valuable to monitor the resistant enterococcal isolates along the production chain and to  individuate steps in which contamination might occur. in fact, isolates of e. faecalis and e. faecium showing the same amplified fragment length polymorphism profile and ar gene pattern were detected in samples taken at different steps of  the food chain suggesting three cases of bacterial clonal spread.

TI  == genetic diversity and safety aspects of enterococci from slightly fermented sausages.
AB  == aims: to determine the biodiversity of enterococci from slightly fermented sausages (chorizo and fuet) at species and strain level by molecular typing, while considering their safety aspects. methods and results: species-specific pcr and partial sequencing of 16s rrna and soda genes were used to identify enterococcal population. enterococcus faecium was the most frequently isolated species followed by e. faecalis, e. hirae and e. durans. randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr revealed species-specific clusters and allowed strain  typing. sixty strains of 106 isolates exhibited different rapd profiles indicating a high genetic variability. all the e. faecalis strains carried virulence genes (efaafs, esp, agg and gele) and all e. faecium isolates carried efaafm gene. enterococcus faecalis showed higher antibiotic resistance than the other species. only one e. faecium strain showed vana genotype (high-level resistance to glycopeptides) and e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus/flavescens isolates showed vanc1 and vanc2/c3 genotypes (low-level resistance only to vancomycin) respectively. conclusions: e. faecalis has been mainly associated with virulence factors and antimicrobial multi-resistance and, although potential risk for human health is low, the presence of this species in slightly fermented  sausages should be avoided to obtain high quality products. significance and impact of the study: the enterococcal population of slightly fermented sausages has been thoroughly characterized. several relevant safety aspects have been revealed.

TI  == emergence of unusual species of enterococci causing infections, south india.
AB  == background: enterococci tend to be one of the leading causes of nosocomial infections, with e. faecalis and e. faecium accounting up to 90% of the clinical  isolates. nevertheless, the incidence of other species of enterococci from clinical sources shows an alarming increase with the properties of intrinsic resistance to several antibiotics including beta-lactams and glycopeptides. thus  proper identification of enterococci to species level is quintessential for management and prevention of these bacteria in any healthcare facility. hence this work was undertaken to study the prevalence of unusual species of enterococci causing human infections, in a tertiary care hospital in south india. methods: the study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in south india from  july 2001 to june 2003. isolates of enterococci were collected from various clinical specimens and speciated using extensive phenotypic and physiological tests. antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed and interpreted as per nccls guidelines. whole cell protein (wcp) fingerprinting of enterococci were done for species validation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) and analyzed computationally. results: our study showed the prevalence of unusual (non-faecalis and non-faecium enterococci) and atypical (biochemical variant) species of enterococci as 19% (46 isolates) and 5% (12 isolates) respectively. the 7 unusual species (46 isolates) isolated and confirmed by phenotypic characterization includes: 15 e. gallinarum (6.2%), 10 e. avium (4.1%), 6 e. raffinosus (2.5%), 6 e. hirae (2.5%), 4 e. mundtii (1.7%), 3 e. casseliflavus-including the two atypical isolates (1.2%) and 2 e. durans (0.8%). the 12 atypical enterococcal species (5%) that showed aberrant sugar reactions in conventional phenotyping were confirmed as e. faecalis, e. faecium and e. casseliflavus respectively by wcp fingerprinting. the antimicrobial susceptibility testing depicted the emergence of high-level aminoglycoside and beta-lactam resistance among different species apart from intrinsic vancomycin resistance by some species, while all the species tested were susceptible for linezolid and teicoplanin. conclusion: our study reveals the emergence of multi-drug resistance among unusual species of enterococci posing a serious therapeutic challenge. precise identification of enterococci to species level enables us to access the species-specific antimicrobial resistance characteristics, apart from knowing the epidemiological pattern and their clinical significance in human infections.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of enterococcus sp. isolated from the intestinal tract of patients from a university hospital in brazil.
AB  == this study reports the results about antimicrobial resistance of enterococcus spp. isolated from intestinal tract of patients from a university hospital in brazil. the identification of strains at species level was performed by conventional biochemical tests, api 20 strep (biomerieux), and polymerase chain reaction assay. the species distribution was e. faecium (34%), followed by e. faecalis (33%), e. gallinarum (23.7%), e. casseliflavus (5.2%), e. avium (1%), and e. hirae (1%). intrinsic resistance to vancomycin characterized by presence of vanc genes was found in e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus. the high prevalence of vanc phenotype enterococci is very important because these species  have been reported as causing a wide variety of infections. vancomycin-resistant  e. faecium or e. faecalis were not found and no one isolate of these species was  a beta-lactamase producer. thirteen clinical isolates of enterococci (13.4%) showed multiresistance patterns, which were defined by resistance to three classes of antibiotics plus resistance to at least one aminoglycoside (gentamicin and/or streptomycin). the resistance to several antimicrobials shown by enterococcal strains obtained in this study is of concern because of the decrease in the therapeutic options for treatment of infections caused by enterococci.

AB  == we determined the groesl sequences (groes, groel, and the intergenic spacer) of 10 clinically relevant enterococcus species and evaluated the feasibility of identifying enterococcus species on the basis of these sequences. seven common clinical enterococcus species, e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. casseliflavus, e. gallinarum, e. avium, e. raffinosus, and e. hirae, and three less common enterococcus species, e. cecorum, e. durans, and e. mundtii, were examined in this study. we found that the groes genes of these enterococcal species are identical in length (285 nucleotides) and contain an unusual putative start codon, gtg. the lengths and sequences of the intergenic regions (spacers between  the groes and groel genes) are quite variable (17 to 57 bp in length) among enterococcus species but are conserved in strains within each species, with only  a few exceptions. considerable variation of groes or groel sequences was also observed. the evolutionary trees of groes or groel sequences revealed similarities among enterococcus species. however, the overall intraspecies variation of groes was less than that of groel. the high interspecies variation and low intraspecies variation indicate that the groes and spacer sequences are more useful than groel for identification of clinically relevant enterococcus species. the sequences of these two genetic traits, groes and spacer, can be determined by a single pcr and direct sequencing and may provide important information for the differentiation of closely related species of enterococcus.

TI  == enterococci spp. isolated from cuba: species frequency of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility profile.
AB  == this study investigated the species distribution and antimicrobial resistance among 99 enterococci isolated from hospitalized patients in 12 hospitals in cuba  from october 2000 to september 2001. species identification was performed by wider automatic system (francisco soria melguizo, madrid, spain), and the susceptibility testing was performed by disk diffusion, agar dilution, and e-test methods. enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent (85%) species, followed by  e. faecium (10%), e. gallinarum (2%), e. casseliflavus (2%), and e. durans-hirae  (1%). a higher percentage of resistance to ampicillin (50%), fosfomycin (40%), ciprofloxacin (30%), norfloxacin (20%), and tetracycline (90%) was detected in e. faecium isolates, whereas e. faecalis strains showed higher rates of resistance to erythromycin (52.4%), chloramphenicol (34.5%), rifampicin (62.5%), moxifloxacin (3%), and nitrofurantoin (2.4%). resistance to glycopeptide was detected in e. faecalis (1.2%) and e. faecium (10%). thirty-one e. faecalis (37%) and 3 e. faecium (30%) showed a high-level resistance to gentamicin. the results  of this work will be very helpful to guide empirical antimicrobial therapy and the implementation of infection control measures in cuban hospitals.

TI  == drug resistance in fecal enterococci in hong kong.
AB  == our purpose was to estimate the rate of carriage of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) in hospitalized patients in a district hospital and in healthy  subjects in the community in hong kong. rectal swabs were collected from all patients admitted to the intensive care unit, and stool specimens were collected  from all patients presenting with suspected antibiotic-associated diarrhea over a 2-month period. stool specimens were also collected from healthy subjects in the  community. specimens were enriched and cultured on selective media for the isolation of enterococci. all isolates were identified, and their minimum inhibitory concentration for vancomycin was determined. susceptibility to other antibiotics was investigated. samples yielded 125 isolates of enterococci, the majority of isolates being enterococcus faecalis (75) and e. faecium (35). nine of 11 strains of e. gallinarum and 2 of 2 strains of e. casseliflavus isolated from hospitalized patients were intermediately resistant to vancomycin, but no strains highly resistant to vancomycin were isolated. resistance to other drugs,  including the fluoroquinolones, was present, and a high-level resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin was found in 37% and 46% of strains, respectively. colonization with vre remains low in hong kong. this result is supported by the low level of isolation of vre from infections in the region and may be attributable to low levels of vancomycin use. high-level aminoglycoside resistance and fluoroquinolone resistance are common, and continued monitoring for vre is suggested.

TI  == vancomycin resistance, esp, and strain relatedness: a 1-year study of enterococcal bacteremia.
AB  == the prevalence of esp, a gene associated with infection-derived and outbreak strains, in enterococcal blood isolates from 2002 was determined. fifty-five of 137 (40.1%) enterococcus faecalis isolates, 30 of 58 (51.7%) e. faecium isolates, 1 of 1 e. raffinosus isolate, 0 of 4 e. gallinarum isolates, and 0 of 1 e. casseliflavus isolate were positive. esp wasn't associated with vancomycin resistance (vr) or clinical service. vr e. faecium isolates were less genetically diverse than vancomycin-susceptible strains. a large cluster of vr isolates, belonging to esp-positive e. faecium, was revealed. these data support the hypothesis that esp and vr may contribute to dissemination of particular clones.

TI  == emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in a tertiary hospital in crete, greece: a cluster of cases and prevalence study on intestinal colonisation.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of five consecutive cases of infection with vancomycin-resistant  enterococci (vre) and the prevalence of faecal carriage of vre among patients admitted to a 700-bed university hospital where no vre had been isolated previously. in a 2-month period, five consecutive patients infected with vre were detected. three vanb+ enterococcus faecium isolates were obtained from three patients, while two vana+ e. faecium isolates, one vana+ enterococcus faecalis isolate and one vanc1+ enterococcus gallinarum isolate were obtained from the other two patients. of 218 faecal specimens from all hospital wards, 41 (18.8%) were found to contain vre. forty-two isolates of vre were obtained, comprising one (2%) e. faecalis, 11 (27%) e. faecium, 24 (57%) e. gallinarum and six (14%) enterococcus casseliflavus/flavescens. four isolates carried the vana gene, eight carried vanb, 24 carried vanc1, and six carried vanc2/c3. use of glycopeptides, the presence of central venous catheters and renal dialysis all correlated with vre colonisation. the prevalence rates were among the highest reported in the literature.

TI  == [antibiotic susceptibility analysis of enterococcus spp. isolated from urine].
AB  == recently increase of enterococcal infections has been observed. these bacteria, mainly enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium are members of the normal flora of gastrointestinal tract but also are typical opportunistic pathogens. enterococci are characterized by natural resistance to numerous antibiotics (among them cephalosporins), and also by easy acquired resistance to antibiotics. infections caused by multiresistant strains are difficult in treatment, chronic,  recurrent and sometimes fatal are described. enterococcal infections are caused often by e. faecalis, rarely by e. faecium. in the last years other species of enterococci have been isolated from different clinical materials (e. casseliflavus, e. avium, e. durans, e. gallinarum). the aim of this study was to  analyze the antibiotics susceptibility of enterococcus spp. isolated from urine of children with urinary tract infection (uti), hospitalized in the upper silesian health center of child and mother or treated ambulatory. susceptibility  of the 130 strains of e. faecalis and 41 e. faecium to: penicillin, tetracycline, high level of aminoglycoside (gentamycin 120 microg and streptomycin 300 microg), glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin), ciprofloxacin and nitrofurantoin was  estimated. all isolated strains of e. faecalis (100%) were sensitive to glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin) and to nitrofurantoin, 96% strains were sensitive to penicillin, 43% to ciprofloxacin and 28% to tetracycline. all strains of e. faecium were sensitive to glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin), 32% strains were sensitive to penicillin, 19% to tetracycline 14% to ciprofloxacin and 50% to nitrofurantoin. twenty two strains of e. faecalis (17%) and twelve strains of e. faecium (29%) were demonstrated high level resistance to aminoglycosides (hlar). among hlar strains of enterococci, were observed strains of high level resistance only to streptomycin, high level resistance only to gentamycin and high level resistance to both aminoglycosides.  the hlar strains of e. faecalis and e. faecium were also resistant to other antibiotics: penicillin, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. the most frequent cause  of child urinary tract infection was e. faecalis, with high sensitivity to penicillins, glycopeptides and nitrofurantoin. the increased role of e. faecium and other strains of enterococci also has been shown. these species demonstrated  sensitivity to glycopeptides, but resistance to other antibiotics, routinely used for treatment of uti as well as to nitrofurantoin.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococcus strains isolated from poultry faeces.
AB  == we have investigated the resistance of enterococcus isolated from poultry faeces  to antibiotics commonly used as therapy of enterococcal infections. identification was made by the method of facklam and collins. minimal inhibitory  concentrations of penicillin, ampicillin, vancomycin and teicoplanin were determined and high level aminoglycoside resistance was investigated. genes codifying high level aminoglycoside resistance (hlar) were determined by pcr. fifty five enterococcus strains were isolated (63.6% e. faecalis, 12.7% e. mundtii, 9.1% e. faecium, 7.3% e. casseliflavus, 3.7% e. durans and 3.6% e. hirae). none of the strains were resistant to van, tec, p or am. hlar was found in 34.5% of strains for sm, 27.3% for km and 7.3% for gm. the gene for the bifunctional enzyme was found only in one strain, that showed hlar to gm and km.  fourteen strains harboured the gene aph(3')-iii, being 11 resistant to km and str, and three resistant to gm, km and str. the remaining six strains showed hlar to str, but were negative for the three genes tested by pcr. the gene ant(4'4") was not detected in any of the strains. no unexpected vancomycin resistance was detected. the resistance rates among poultry strains were lower than those found  among human strains isolated from hospital patients in recent canary studies.

TI  == molecular epidemiology and antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococci recovered  from brazilian intensive care units.
AB  == we studied the antimicrobial resistance and the molecular epidemiology of 99 enterococcal surveillance isolates from two hospitals of brasilia, brazil. conventional biochemical tests were used to identify the enterococcal species and the disk diffusion method was used to determine their resistance profiles. enterococcus faecalis (76%) and e. faecium (9%) were the most prevalent species.  no enterococci showed the vana or vanb vancomycin resistance phenotypes or genotypes. only the intrinsically resistant species e. gallinarum (n=2) and e. casseliflavus (n=3) harbored the vancomycin-resistance genes vanc1 and vanc2/3, respectively. we found e. faecalis isolates with high-level resistance to gentamicin (22%) and streptomycin (8%) and both e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates with resistance to more than two antimicrobials (84% and 67%, respectively). nine e. faecalis isolates (12%) were resistant to ampicillin; the  minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values were 16 microg/ml (n=6) and 32 microg/ml (n=3). among these ampicillin-resistant e. faecalis, seven were also resistant to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, rifampin, penicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and erythromycin. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis classified those  isolates in three different genotypes, suggesting dissemination of genetically related ampicillin-resistant e. faecalis strains among different patients.

TI  == proficiency of determination of vancomycin susceptibility in enterococci by clinical laboratories in taiwan.
AB  == eighty clinical microbiology laboratories in taiwan were evaluated for proficiency in the determination of vancomycin susceptibility of enterococci. each laboratory was given 1 vancomycin-sensitive isolate and 3 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) isolates to determine the levels of vancomycin resistance. among a total of 240 tests performed, 153 (63.8%) correctly determined the levels of vancomycin resistance of the survey isolates.  seventy eight (98%) of the 80 laboratories accurately identified the high level of vancomycin resistant isolates [enterococcus faecalis; minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) >256 microg/ml]. seventy two laboratories (90%) correctly determined the level of vancomycin resistance of another vre with a vancomycin mic of 64 microg/ml. only 3 of the 80 laboratories correctly determined the intermediate-level vancomycin resistant isolates (enterococcus casseliflavus; mic = 8 microg/ml). eight laboratories reported the vancomycin-susceptible isolate as being vancomycin-resistant or of intermediate susceptibility. this survey demonstrated that clinical microbiology laboratories in taiwan are proficient in  detecting high-level but not low-level vre, suggesting a need to improve their proficiency in vre detection.

TI  == evaluation of the prevalence and risk factors for colonization by vancomycin-resistant enterococcus among patients on dialysis.
AB  == background: vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) has been reported among long-term dialysis patients, although risk factors for vre colonization are not well defined. this study aims to appraise the prevalence and risk factors for vre colonization among patients on long-term dialysis therapy, as well as the mechanisms for dissemination of vancomycin resistance. methods: this is a cross-sectional survey of 320 patients on long-term dialysis therapy at 2 hospitals of the federal university of sao paulo from june 2001 to march 2003. fecal samples were collected from each patient once a week for 1 month. samples with positive test results for vre were submitted to molecular typing through automated ribotyping. results: vre prevalence was 14.4%. there were significant associations between vre and dialysis type (hemodialysis, p = 0.04), number of hospitalizations (p = 0.03), low hemoglobin level (p = 0.03), and leukocytosis (p = 0.05). among samples with vre (n = 56), 25% were enterococcus faecium; 10.7%, enterococcus casseliflavus; 57.1%, enterococcus gallinarum; and 3.6%, enterococcus faecalis. all samples isolated were sensitive to teicoplanin, except for e faecium samples, which were strongly resistant, although 9 of 14 patients with this isolate presented the same ribogroup (111-s-4). typing of 6 samples from 8 dialysis patients with e gallinarum was performed, showing a predominant ribogroup (112-s-4). conclusion: hospital environment, hemodialysis, anemia, and  leukocytosis appear to be associated with vre colonization. these results suggest that dissemination of these bacteria among patients on long-term dialysis therapy may be taking place.

AB  == this study investigated the distribution of genes for aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (ame) and the genetic relatedness of high-level aminoglycoside-resistant  enterococci isolated in kuwait hospitals. a total of 117 enterococci, consisting  of 109 enterococcus faecalis, seven enterococcus faecium, and one enterococcus casseliflavus were studied. the mics of gentamicin, kanamycin, amikacin, tobramycin, and streptomycin were determined by agar dilution and the genes encoding the aac(6')- aph(2"), ant(4'), aph(3'), aph (2")-ib, aph (2")-ic, aph (2")-id, and ant(6) enzymes were amplified by pcr. they were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). filter mating was used to transfer gentamicin resistance determinants. they were all resistant to kanamycin (mic 2000 mg/l). fifty-five isolates were resistant to gentamicin (mic 500 mg/l), 72 were resistant to tobramycin (mic 64 mg/l), 115 were resistant to amikacin (mic 64 mg/l), and 97 were resistant to streptomycin (mic 1000 mg/l). the aac(6')-ie-aph(2")-ia was detected in all isolates with gentamicin mic 500 mg/l and in 15 isolates with gentamicin mic 256 mg/l. the aph(3')-iiia gene was detected in 101 isolates, whereas the ant(6')-ia gene was detected in 85 of the 97 streptomycin-resistant isolates with mic 1000 mg/l. the aac(6')-ii gene was detected only in the seven e. faecium isolates. none of them contained ant(4')-ia, aph(2")-ib, aph(2")-ic and aph(2")-id. pfge revealed heterogeneous patterns with no dominant clone. the results demonstrated that ame are common in  aminoglycoside-resistant enterococci isolated in kuwait. however, the absence of  a dominant clone suggests that they acquired high-level aminoglycoside independently.

AB  == objectives: study possible links between vancomycin-resistant enterococci strains isolated from human stool samples and from pork or poultry food products. methods: one hundred and eleven vancomycin-resistant enterococci strains (15 vana and 96 vanc) were isolated from human stool samples and from pork or poultry food products. characterization of the tn1546-like element of the 15 vana strains was  realized by restriction analysis of pcr products and polymorphism study. the 96 strains of vanc phenotype (75 enterococcus gallinarum and 21 enterococcus casseliflavus) were analysed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). results: in the study described here, polymorphism of the tn1546-like element enabled the  establishment of five groups. groups iii, iv and v were found only in human strains. groups i and ii were found to occur in strains isolated from humans and  from food, suggesting a possible transfer of the tn1546-like element. the isolates from group i harboured the whole tn1546 element. in group ii, the five strains possessed a novel tn1546-like element, characterized by a single-nucleotide difference in the vanx gene and a deletion upstream from the nucleotide 164. analysis by pfge of the 75 e. gallinarum strains revealed 20 different patterns. one pattern was shared by isolates from pork food and human samples. none of the 21 e. casseliflavus strains tested was found to share similar pfge patterns. conclusions: results tend to support the possible transfer of the tn1546-like element between strains of vana phenotype. concerning vanc phenotype strains, the transfer was not demonstrated.

TI  == prevalence and molecular characterization of tetracycline resistance in enterococcus isolates from food.
AB  == in the present study, a collection of 187 enterococcus food isolates mainly originating from european cheeses were studied for the phenotypic and genotypic assessment of tetracycline (tc) resistance. a total of 45 isolates (24%) encompassing the species enterococcus faecalis (n = 33), e. durans (n = 7), e. faecium (n = 3), e. casseliflavus (n = 1), and e. gallinarum (n = 1) displayed phenotypic resistance to tc with mic ranges of 16 to 256 microg/ml. eight of these strains exhibited multiresistance to tc, erythromycin, and chloramphenicol. by pcr detection, tc resistance could be linked to the presence of the tet(m) (n  = 43), tet(l) (n = 16), and tet(s) (n = 1) genes. in 15 isolates, including all of those for which the mic was 256 micro g/ml, both tet(m) and tet(l) were found. furthermore, all tet(m)-containing enterococci also harbored a member of the tn916-tn1545 conjugative transposon family, of which 12 erythromycin-resistant isolates also contained the erm(b) gene. filter mating experiments revealed that  10 e. faecalis isolates, 3 e. durans isolates, and 1 e. faecium isolate could transfer either tet(m), tet(l), or both of these genes to e. faecalis recipient strain jh2-2. in most cases in which only tet(m) was transferred, no detectable plasmids were acquired by jh2-2 but instead all transconjugants contained a member of the tn916-tn1545 family. sequencing analysis of pcr amplicons and evolutionary modeling showed that a subset of the transferable tet(m) genes belonged to four sequence homology groups (shgs) showing an internal homology of  > or = 99.6%. two of these shgs contained tet(m) mosaic structures previously found in tn916 elements and on lactobacillus and neisseria plasmids, respectively, whereas the other two shgs probably represent new phylogenetic lineages of this gene.

AB  == the occurrence, structure, and mobility of tn1546-like elements were studied in environmental vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) isolated from municipal sewage, activated sludge, pharmaceutical waste derived from antibiotic production, seawater, blue mussels, and soil. of 200 presumptive vre isolates tested, 71 (35%) harbored vana. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis allowed the detection of 26 subtypes, which were identified as enterococcus faecium (n =  13), e. casseliflavus (n = 6), e. mundtii (n = 3), e. faecalis (n = 3), and e. durans (n = 1) by phenotypic tests and 16s ribosomal dna sequencing. long pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism (l-pcr-rflp) analysis of tn1546-like elements and pcr analysis of internal regions revealed the presence of seven groups among the 29 strains studied. the most common group (group 1) corresponded to the structure of tn1546 in the prototype strain e. faecium bm4147. two novel l-pcr-rflp patterns (groups 3 and 4) were found for e. casseliflavus strains. indistinguishable tn1546-like elements occurred in vre strains belonging to different species or originating from different sources. interspecies plasmid-mediated transfer of vancomycin resistance to e. faecium bm4105 was demonstrated for e. faecalis, e. mundtii, and e. durans. this study indicates that vre, including species other than e. faecium and e. faecalis, are widespread in nature and in environments that are not exposed to vancomycin selection and not heavily contaminated with feces, such as seawater, blue mussels, and nonagricultural soil. tn1546-like elements can readily transfer between enterococci of different species and ecological origins, therefore raising questions about the origin of these transposable elements and their possible transfer between environmental and clinical settings.

AB  == the use of avoparcin as a growth promoter is considered to have selected for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). in costa rica, the use of avoparcin for poultry and swine was intensive until the product was withdrawn from the market in 2000. we evaluated the presence of vre in poultry, swine, and cattle fecal samples obtained during 1998 and 1999. a total of 185 vre isolates were recovered from 116 out of 893 samples. enterococcus faecium was the most frequently isolated species (50.8%), being predominant among poultry (71.6%) and swine (37.7%) isolates, but it was not recovered from the bovine samples. the second-most-frequently-isolated species from poultry and swine, respectively, were e. durans (23.2%) and e. faecalis (21.7%). e. casseliflavus was the only species obtained from bovine samples, but it was not found among the avian isolates. an evident predominance of the vana determinant among vancomycin-resistant enterococcal species from poultry and swine, but not from cattle, was observed and was similar to the situation in european countries before avoparcin was forbidden. the diversity of the vana determinant in the isolates was assessed by detection of the is1251 insertion in the vansh intergenic region and of the is1476 insertion in the vanxy intergenic region. however, in none of the 154 vana+ isolates recovered in this study were those insertions detected.

TI  == in vitro activity of daptomycin against vancomycin-resistant enterococci of various van types and comparison of susceptibility testing methods.
AB  == the increasing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (vre) infections and the limited number of antimicrobial agents for their treatment emphasize a need for new, more effective agents. in this study, the in vitro activity of daptomycin was determined against a collection of 156 vre from seven different institutions. van types were characterized by pcr, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was performed to exclude isolates with >85% relatedness by dendrogram. included were 126 enterococcus faecium (109 vana, 17 vanb) isolates,  5 enterococcus faecalis (3 vana, 2 vanb) isolates, 2 enterococcus avium (vana) isolates, 1 enterococcus durans (vana) isolate, 10 enterococcus gallinarum (vanc1) isolates, and 12 enterococcus casseliflavus (vanc2) isolates. mics of daptomycin and five additional agents were determined by the nccls broth microdilution method with mueller-hinton (mh) broth containing supplemental calcium. mics were also determined using two investigational e-test strip formulations, and disk diffusion testing was performed by the standard nccls method. the mic of daptomycin at which 50% of the isolates tested were inhibited  for this isolate collection was 4 microg/ml, and the mic at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited was 8 microg/ml. two isolates of vana e. faecium were resistant to linezolid, and one isolate was resistant to quinupristin-dalfopristin. mics of daptomycin determined by the e test with and without added calcium varied by 8- to 16-fold, and disk diffusion zones varied by 3 to 6 mm according to the calcium content of the commercial mh agar lots used in the study. this study has shown daptomycin to have good activity against a diverse collection of contemporary vre isolates. however, improved standardization of the calcium content of mh agar will be important for reliable  testing of daptomycin by clinical laboratories using either the e test or disk diffusion methods.

TI  == species distribution and antibiotic resistance patterns of enterococci isolated from food of animal origin in germany.
AB  == presently, enterococci take the third place of bacterial pathogens associated with nosocomial infections, after staphylococci and escherichia coli. especially, the resistances of enterococci to several available antibiotics are threatening.  we attempted to determine which species of enterococci could be found in food of  animal origin and their significance according to their antibiotic resistances for human beings. from november 2000 to may 2002 we investigated 155 samples of food of animal origin bought in retail outlets in germany: 27 samples of sausages, 19 of ham, 83 of minced meat, 26 of cheese. from these food samples we  isolated 416 enterococcal strains. the most frequent species was enterococcus faecalis (299 strains); furthermore, we found enterococcus faecium (54 strains),  enterococcus durans together with enterococcus hirae (24 strains), enterococcus casseliflavus (22 strains), enterococcus avium (9 strains) and enterococcus gallinarum (8 strains). we focused on the resistance patterns of 118 selected e.  faecium and e. faecalis strains to 13 antimicrobial active agents (ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, avilamycin, chloramphenicol, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, flavomycin, gentamicin, penicillin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, teicoplanin, tetracycline and vancomycin). from the clinical point of view, the situation of antibiotic resistance to the examined antimicrobial agents seemed to be favourable. the investigated strains were sensitive to ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. these antibiotics are, in combination with an aminoglycoside, for example gentamicin, agents of choice for the treatment of enterococcal infections in human medicine. only one e. faecium strain was resistant to penicillin, while all strains were sensitive to the glycopeptide antibiotics, vancomycin and teicoplanin. resistances found against the antibiotics, tetracycline, quinupristin/dalfopristin and erythromycin, are causes for concern.

TI  == species identification and detection of vancomycin resistance genes in enterococci of animal origin by multiplex pcr.
AB  == a multiplex pcr assay for the differentiation of species and detection of vancomycin (van) resistance genes in enterococci was established. three hundred sixty-seven enterococcal strains isolated from food were selected from a sample collection and were examined with regards to the existence of four vancomycin resistance genes (vana, vanb, vanc1 and vanc2) and to species differentiation (e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. casseliflavus and e. gallinarum) by multiplex pcr. apart from unambiguous results for the majority of strains, the e. faecium specific primers used here, showed weak points in the specificity and sensitivity, respectively. despite these rare instances, we succeeded in optimising the multiplex pcr assay by variation of annealing temperature and primer combination. the assay presented here, with its optimised parameters, is therefore suitable for routine use and because of time and material saving, it is an alternative and rapid method in comparison to conventional tests.

TI  == taxonomy, ecology and antibiotic resistance of enterococci from food and the gastro-intestinal tract.
AB  == apart from genotypic identification methods, there is a need for reliable conventional phenotypic identification schemes for simple and rapid determination of enterococcal species in food or in the gastro-intestinal tract (git). only a limited number of enterococcal species is of importance for the ecology of the git or the food microflora, including e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. durans/hirae, e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus. after genus identification the differentiation within these species can include, e.g. mannitol and arabinose fermentation and growth at 50 degrees c. widely used commercial identification systems may fail to precisely identify rare species. ecological aspects should also be taken into account. in the human git e. faecium is the most common species whereas in most animal species e. faecalis is at least present in the same amount. especially in foods of animal origin (cheese, pork meat, beef, poultry meat) also e. faecalis is very frequent. this is of special interest as glycopeptide resistance is most often found in human clinical e. faecium strains  as well as in e. faecium from the environment or animal samples and less frequent in e. faecalis strains. eu experts propose as safety criteria for probiotics in feed additives the exclusion of resistances or the lack of transferability. this  proposal can also be applied to enterococci in foods. specific resistances must be excluded, but transferability or acquisition of resistance (e.g. vancomycin) cannot be excluded per se. however, technologically used strains should differ from clinical strains concerning their resistance patterns and transfer rates.

TI  == susceptibility of gram-positive bacteria from icu patients in uk hospitals to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == microbiologists in 25 sentinel laboratories were each asked to refer up to 100 clinically-significant gram-positive bacteria isolated from consecutive intensive care unit (icu) patients. a total of 1595 isolates were collected from patients in 23 hospitals; these included staphylococcus aureus (47.6%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (30.6%), enterococci (14.3%), pneumococci (2.8%) and other streptococci (3.5%). a few coryneforms, other bacilli and a nocardia sp. were also collected. rates of oxacillin resistance among s. aureus and cns isolates were 59.3 and 78.5%, respectively. vancomycin-resistant s. aureus were not detected, although two isolates (0.3%) were resistant to teicoplanin [minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) 8 mg/l]. in contrast, 13.7% of cns were teicoplanin resistant (mics 8-32 mg/l) and 1.2% were resistant to vancomycin. among the enterococci, 72.5% were enterococcus faecalis and 24.5% were enterococcus faecium, the remainder including isolates of enterococcus casseliflavus or enterococcus gallinarum. eighteen percent of e. faecium isolates were vancomycin-resistant, compared with only 3% of e. faecalis isolates. rates of high-level gentamicin resistance in e. faecalis and e. faecium were 40 and 25%, respectively. nine percent of pneumococci and streptococci were resistant to penicillin, with 7 and 11%, respectively, resistant to erythromycin. none of the  isolates showed resistance to linezolid, with the mics for the entire study population falling in the range of 0.5-4 mg/l.

TI  == species composition and antimicrobial resistance genes of enterococcus spp, isolated from integrated and traditional fish farms in thailand.
AB  == integrated fish farming uses the manure from animal husbandry as fertilisers in the fish ponds. a total of 410 enterococcal isolates, from integrated and traditional fish farms in thailand, were collected to assess whether the input of manure from chickens receiving feed containing growth promoters and antimicrobial treatments influenced the species composition and the bacterial antimicrobial resistance in the fish pond environment. enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis were the predominate species isolated from the integrated farms, whereas e. casseliflavus and e. mundtii isolates were most prevalent in traditional farms. enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium demonstrated the highest prevalence of resistance, whereas e. mundtii isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobials tested. all the enterococci species isolated from the integrated farms, generally demonstrated higher resistance phenotypes to the tested antimicrobials compared with the same species from traditional farms. the erm(b) and tet(m) genes, associated with resistance to erythromycin and tetracycline, respectively, were found in 87% of the erythromycin-resistant and 95% of the oxytetracycline-resistant enterococci isolates respectively. these results suggest that the species composition and antimicrobial resistance of enterococci  in tropical aquatic environments are influenced by faecal and antimicrobial pollution.

TI  == phenotypes and genotypes of vancomycin-resistant enterococci isolated during long-term follow-up in a patient with recurrent bacteremia and colonization.
AB  == twenty-seven isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were obtained at monthly intervals from a bed-ridden man with hypoxic encephalopathy. during the 28-month period of the patient's hospitalization, 3 episodes of bacteremia and one episode of catheter-related infection caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci occurred. rectal swabs showed colonization of vancomycin-resistant enterococci for more than 2 years. three months after termination of antimicrobial therapy, the rectal colonization for vancomycin-resistant enterococci was eradicated. four species (enterococcus faecium, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus casseliflavus) were identified among the 27 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus isolates. three non-clonal related patterns were found among 17 strains of e. faecium by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. all of the 3 e. faecalis isolates were of the vanb phenotype, but of the vana genotype. linezolid had the most potent in vitro  activity against these vancomycin-resistant enterococcus isolates, with minimum inhibitory concentrations >2 microg/ml. eighty-five percent of these vancomycin-resistant enterococcus isolates were susceptible to tetracycline and 66% were susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. although a high genetic correlation of e. faecium was identified in the patient with prolonged hospitalization, the isolation of 3 genetically unrelated colonized isolates suggested a lack of correlation between infection and colonization. precautions against resistant organisms, adapted antibiotic policies, and elimination of patient carriage are useful for controlling the spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci.

TI  == effect of raw-milk cheese consumption on the enterococcal flora of human feces.
AB  == enterococci are one of the major facultative anaerobic bacterial groups that reside in the human gastrointestinal tract. in the present study, the composition of the enterococcal fecal flora in three healthy humans was analyzed before, during, and after the daily consumption of approximately 125 g of a raw-milk cheddar-type cheese containing 3.2 x 10(4) enterococci/g of cheese. enterococcal  counts ranged between 1.4 x 10(2) and 2.5 x 10(8) cfu/g of feces and differed from subject to subject and from week to week. the cheese contained mainly enterococcus casseliflavus and a small population of enterococcus faecalis. clonal relationships were determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. before  and after consumption of the cheese, samples from humans contained mainly enterococcus faecium, with some of the clones being resident. during consumption  of the cheese, one particular transient clone of e. faecalis, clone fs2, which was present in small numbers in the cheese, largely dominated the feces. two clones of e. casseliflavus from the cheese were also found in the feces of one of the subjects during cheese consumption. these results suggest that a clone need not be present in a food in high numbers to establish itself in the intestine.

TI  == characterization of tn1546 in vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium isolated  from canine urinary tract infections: evidence of gene exchange between human and animal enterococci.
AB  == thirty-five enterococcal isolates were recovered from dogs diagnosed with urinary tract infections at the michigan state university veterinary teaching hospital over a 2-year period (1996 to 1998). isolated species included enterococcus faecium (n = 13), enterococcus faecalis (n = 7), enterococcus gallinarum (n = 11), and enterococcus casseliflavus (n = 4). antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed several different resistance phenotypes, with the majority of the enterococcal isolates exhibiting resistance to three or more antibiotics. one e.  faecium isolate, cvm1869, displayed high-level resistance to vancomycin (mic > 32 micro g/ml) and gentamicin (mic > 2,048 micro g/ml). molecular analysis of this isolate revealed the presence of tn1546 (vana), responsible for high-level vancomycin resistance, and tn5281 carrying aac6'-aph2", conferring high-level aminoglycoside resistance. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that cvm1869 was a canine e. faecium clone that had acquired tn1546, perhaps from a human vancomycin-resistant e. faecium. transposons tn5281 and tn1546 were located on two different conjugative plasmids. sequence analysis revealed that in tn1546, orf1 had an 889-bp deletion and an is1216v insertion at the 5' end and an is1251 insertion between vans and vanh. to date, this particular form of tn1546 has only been described in human clinical vancomycin-resistant enterococcus isolates unique to the united states. additionally, this is the first report of a vancomycin-resistant e. faecium isolated from a companion animal in the united states.

TI  == source of enterococci in a farmhouse raw-milk cheese.
AB  == enterococci are widely distributed in raw-milk cheeses and are generally thought  to positively affect flavor development. their natural habitats are the human and animal intestinal tracts, but they are also found in soil, on plants, and in the  intestines of insects and birds. the source of enterococci in raw-milk cheese is  unknown. in the present study, an epidemiological approach with pulsed-field gel  electrophoresis (pfge) was used to type 646 enterococcus strains which were isolated from a cheddar-type cheese, the milk it was made from, the feces of cows and humans associated with the cheese-making unit, and the environment, including the milking equipment, the water used on the farm, and the cows' teats. nine different pfge patterns, three of enterococcus casseliflavus, five of enterococcus faecalis, and one of enterococcus durans, were found. the same three clones, one of e. faecalis and two of e. casseliflavus, dominated almost all of the milk, cheese, and human fecal samples. the two e. casseliflavus clones were also found in the bulk tank and the milking machine even after chlorination, suggesting that a niche where enterococci could grow was present and that contamination with enterococci begins with the milking equipment. it is likely but unproven that the enterococci present in the human feces are due to consumption of the cheese. cow feces were not considered the source of enterococci in the cheese, as enterococcus faecium and streptococcus bovis, which largely dominated the cows' intestinal tracts, were not found in either the milk  or the cheese.

AB  == objective: to determine exactly how german and austrian routine laboratories perform tests for the identification of enterococci and determination of their glycopoptide resistance. methods: six enterococcal test strains with different types of glycopeptide resistance (enterococcus faecium, vana; e. faecalis, vana;  e. faecium, vanb; e. faecalis, vanb; e. gallinarum, vanc1; e. casseliflavus, vanc2) were sent as anonymous isolates to 73 clinical microbiology laboratories (65 in germany; eight in austria). the participating laboratories had to identify the strains up to the species level and to determine their antibiotic susceptibilities to the glycopeptides vancomycin and teicoplanin by the test method(s) that are used daily in the corresponding laboratories. results: the analysis of the results received from 62 laboratories (56 from germany, six from  austria) demonstrated that the most used routine method in susceptibility testing was the agar diffusion test, followed by the etest, and the microbroth dilution procedure. the majority of participants had no difficulties in susceptibility testing with the vana-type strains. however, the agar diffusion test was often not able to recognize clearly the vanb and vanc strains; some problems also arose with vanb isolates in the etest. with the microbroth dilution method, the corresponding type of glycopeptide resistance was correctly determined in the majority of enterococcal test strains. difficulties also arose in identification, especially with the vanc strains (e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus), which were often falsely identified as e. faecium. the reasons for these errors are obviously based on the lack of important tests (such as motility and presence of  a yellow pigment) in some commercially available identification test kits.

TI  == composition of enterococcal and streptococcal flora from pigeon intestines.
AB  == aims: to identify the streptococcal and enterococcal components of the microflora from pigeon intestines to species level by tdna-intergenic polymerase chain reaction. methods and results: gram-positive coccal strains were isolated from the intestines or faeces of 50 different pigeons, all from different lofts, on columbia cna blood agar. sodium azide-sensitive enterococci were found to constitute the major coccal members of the intestinal flora of pigeons. forty-two of 69 isolates were identified as enterococcus columbae (84% of animals tested positive), while e. cecorum was encountered in 28% of all animals (14 isolates).  minor species (less than 10% of pigeons positive) were e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. casseliflavus, streptococcus alactolyticus and strep. gallolyticus. contrary to the species description of e. columbae and e. cecorum,  some of the strains were found to be motile. certain other minor differences with the species description of e. columbae are also indicated. conclusions: enterococcus columbae is the major gram-positive facultatively anaerobic component of the pigeon intestinal flora. certain phenotypic characteristics differ from the original species description. the potentially pathogenic strep. gallolyticus is a minor component of the microflora. enterococcus faecium and e.  faecalis are rare in pigeons. significance and impact of the study: the enterococcal and streptococcal flora of pigeons is composed of mainly host-specific bacteria. these are not likely to act as zoonotic pathogens nor as  carriers of antibiotic resistance determinants possibly spreading to humans.

TI  == enterococcal diversity in the environment of an irish cheddar-type cheesemaking factory.
AB  == enterococci are natural residents of human and animal intestinal tracts and grow  to high levels in a variety of artisanal cheeses. the aim of this study was to determine the diversity of enterococci in a farmhouse raw-milk cheese production  unit. putative enterococci were isolated from the faeces of all the cows and all  the people associated with the cheesemaking, from the milk and cheese during manufacture and ripening and from the environment in three separate trials. almost 1400 isolates were screened using a genus-specific primer. the results indicated that all the human, milk, curd and cheese isolates but only 33.7%, 6.7% and 4.4% of the bovine isolates from the three trials, respectively, were members of the genus enterococcus. rapd-pcr was used to type the enterococcal isolates. in general, only e. faecium was found in the bovine faeces while e. casseliflavus dominated the human faeces, milk and cheese followed by lower numbers of e. faecalis. environmental sampling of the water in the milking parlour and rinses of the cows' teats, the bulk-milk storage tank and the milking machine corroborated these results as e. casseliflavus and e. faecalis were the only enterococcus species found in these samples. the putative vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre), isolated in trial 1, were shown to be pediococcus spp. by genotypic and phenotypic analysis.

TI  == the duel study: a multi-center in vitro evaluation of linezolid compared with other antibiotics in the netherlands.
AB  == objective: to evaluate bacterial susceptibility to linezolid in the netherlands in comparison with other antibiotics. methods: bacterial strains were isolated between september 1999 and january 2000 from patients presumed to require antibiotic treatment. the in vitro activity of 1226 strains from 34 participating laboratories was tested against linezolid, vancomycin, teicoplanin, oxacillin, penicillin, erythromycin, ampicillin and other antibiotics against enterococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) were obtained with the e test on mueller-hinton agar: every laboratory included control strains. for vancomycin and teicoplanin only, brain-heart infusion agar and an inoculum of 2.0 mcfarland  was used for staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci to support a better growth and clear recognition of hetero-resistant  colonies. results: the values of mic90 for linezolid were 1.5, 0.75, 0.75 and 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci, respectively. six enterococcal strains with decreased susceptibility against vancomycin or teicoplanin were identified as enterococcus  faecium, e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus (two strains each) and they were found to harbor vana, vanc1 and vanc2/3 genes, respectively. nine per cent of streptococcus pneumoniae (an increase from 1% 4 years ago) showed decreased susceptibility to erythromycin, of both the ermb and mefe type; there was no cross-resistance with linezolid. twelve coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains were resistant to teicoplanin. conclusion: linezolid is a promising drug in the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive cocci. cross-resistance with other antibiotics tested was not found.

TI  == [epidemiological study on vancomycin-resistant enterococci from fecal samples in  the east area of japan].
AB  == recently, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) have become important nosocomial pathogens in the world. in japan, the vre-infection was first reported in 1996. however, an epidemiological study on vre has not been aggressively done in japan. we conducted a survey study to explore the incidence and antimicrobial susceptibility of vancomycin-resistant enterococci isolated from fecal samples at 45 hospitals in the east area of japan (kanto, koshinetsu, tohoku, and hokkaido)  during june 1998 to march 1999. the enterococcosel agar containing vanocomycin (bbl) was used for screening vre from fecal samples in each hospital. the susceptibilities of the isolates to 8 antimicrobials were determined by the broth microdilution method and the definitions of resistance were based on current standards of the nccls standards. the vre genotypes (vana, vanb, vanc1, and van c2/3) were confirmed by amplifying the respective genes by pcr. eight hundred and ninety four strains of enterococci were tested by the microtiter plates hybridization method (wakunaga seiyaku, japan). one thousand five hundred eighty  three strains of enterococci were collected from 6,914 patients in 45 hospitals.  these strains included 72 (4.5%) strains enterococcus faecalis, 33 (2.1%) strains enterococcus faecium, 17 (1.1%) strains enterococcus avium, 1,040 (65.7%) strains enterococcus gallinarum, 386 (24.4%) strains enterococcus cassliflavus, and 35 (2.2%) strains enterococcus flavescens. these strains of vancomycin-resistant e.  faecalis were isolated from 3 patients, two of these 3 strains had van a gene and other one had van b gene. those 3 strains were in the kanto area, and 2 of 3 strains were in tokyo, generally, though van a type vre was highly resistaant to  both vancomycin and teicoplanin. in our study, two strains of van a type e. faecalis were highly resistant to vancomycin (mics > 128 micrograms/ml) and susceptible to teicoplanin with mics 4 micrograms/ml. those two strains were different in susceptibilities of minocycline and ofloxacin. the result of the analysis of pfge had also different patterns. vanb type e. fecalis was highly resistant to vancomycin and susceptible to teicoplanin (mics 0.25 microgram/ml).  for ampicillin and imipenem, 3 strains of e. faecalis were susceptible (mic < or  = 1 microgram/ml). one of 562 strains of e. gallinarum had vanb and vanc1 genes and was moderately resistant to vancomycin and susceptible to teicoplanin. all strains of e. casseliflavus and e. flavescens had vanc2/c3 gene only. all strains of e. faecium and e. avium did not detect van genes. from this result, it was supposed that vre were very rare in the east of japan.

TI  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of gram-positive aerobic clinical  isolates. mics were determined by an agar dilution method on mueller-hinton agar  (nccls/eucast) and on isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/l free calcium (bsac). both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. daptomycin mics for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/l. for 99 of the 100 enterococci (enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/l. for all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin mics were 0.016- 0.25 mg/l; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/l. for miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including lactobacillus spp., lactococcus spp., leuconostoc spp., pediococcus spp. and isolates of enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin mics were 0.03-2 mg/l; mics for the seven isolates of listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/l. there was little difference between the results on mueller-hinton agar and  on supplemented isotonic agar the discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented isotonic agar. daptomycin was active (mics < or = 2 mg/l) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of e. faecium and l. monocytogenes (mics = 4 mg/l). our results indicate that daptomycin mics are independent of methicillin and vancomycin mics.

TI  == identification of plant-associated enterococci.
AB  == aims: enterococcus isolates from forage grass were subjected to taxonomical investigations and tested for antibiotic resistance. methods and results: the identification procedure included phenotypic characterizations, restriction analyses of polymerase chain reaction-amplified 16s rdna, whole-cell protein profile analyses and 16s rdna sequence analyses. agar diffusion tests were performed to detect antibiotic resistance. conclusion: the isolates were identified as belonging to the species enterococcus faecium, ent. mundtii, ent. casseliflavus, ent. faecalis and ent. sulfureus. however, the majority of isolates differed distinctly in their restriction patterns from those of known species. they formed a group of a homogeneous 16s rdna genotype (vi). the 16s rdna sequence of a representative isolate revealed the closest relationship to the species ent. faecalis (similarity of 97.4%). all isolates were sensitive to vancomycin, but almost all were resistant to gentamycin and streptomycin. significance and impact of the study: the taxonomical investigations suggest that the isolates of the 16s rdna genotype vi represent a new plant-associated enterococcus species.

TI  == population dynamics and antagonistic potential of enterococci colonizing the phyllosphere of grasses.
AB  == aims: to investigate the spatial and temporal dynamics of enterococci colonizing  forage grass and their ability to produce bacteriocins. methods and results: enterococci could be detected on above-ground plant parts throughout the growing  season, with high continuity but low cell numbers (2.60 x 101-6.16 x 104 cfu g-1  fresh matter). a total of 750 strains were isolated and identified by their whole-cell protein patterns as enterococcus faecalis (7.9%), ent. mundtii (7.9%), ent. casseliflavus (5.5%), ent. faecium (5.2%) and ent. sulfureus (0.1%). the vast majority of the strains (69.7%) formed a homogeneous 16s rdna genotype that  differed from those of known enterococci. a screening for antagonistic activity using an agar spot test revealed that 18.4% of all isolates were potential antagonists. partially-purified proteins extracted from cell-free culture supernatant fluids of various species were characterized as ph- and heat-stable bacteriocins active against a wide range of lactic acid bacteria, clostridia and  listeria. the producing strains were antagonistically active even on 'phylloplane agar' at temperatures between 4 and 37 degrees c. conclusion: enterococci are a common part of the epiphytic microflora of grasses, displaying probably some antagonistic activity. significance and impact of the study: the results provide  new information on the distribution, species diversity and antagonistic potential of enterococci in the phyllosphere.

AB  == based on partial sequence analysis of pcr-amplified 16s rdna variable v6 regions  of 14 enterococcal type strains, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus avium, enterococcus raffinosus and enterococcus saccharolyticus showed characteristic sequence motifs which made it  possible to separate them into six individual species lines. furthermore, two species cluster groups could be identified, including (i) enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus malodoratus, and (ii) enterococcus casseliflavus/enterococcus flavescens, enterococcus pseudoavium, enterococcus dispar and enterococcus sulfureus. there were identical dna sequences in the v6 region within each group. temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (ttge) of the pcr products from 16 type strains, 12 enterococcal  reference strains and 8 clinical isolates revealed that a single nucleotide divergence in dna sequences was sufficient for separation, identification and division of the studied enterococcal strains into corresponding ttge profiles. it was concluded that partial dna sequence analysis and ttge profiling of pcr-amplified 16s rdna variable v6 regions provide useful tools for the identification of clinically important enterococcus spp.

TI  == gastrointestinal colonisation of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus in a singapore teaching hospital.
AB  == vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) has become an important nosocomial pathogen in many countries but is still rare in singapore. a study was conducted  from january to march 1997 at a 900-bed teaching hospital to determine the prevalence of intestinal colonisation of vre in the patient population. a total of 299 consecutive stool specimens received by the microbiology laboratory for routine testing were plated onto two different selective media for comparison. vre isolated were phenotypically characterised using minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) to vancomycin and teicoplanin and then typed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) with smal digestion of dna. vre were detected in the stool of 35 patients (12.3%). this group consisted of four isolates with vanb (one enterococcus faecalis and three e. faecium) and 31 isolates with vanc (30 e. casseliflavus and one e. gallinarum). two patients (0.7%) carried isolates (both vanb) with high level resistance to vancomycin (mic > or = 256 microg/ml) while the rest had isolates of low level resistance (mic =  8 microg/ml). except for isolates from the same patients, pfge patterns were diverse, suggesting that the vre isolates were genotypically different and possibly introduced from many sources. this study demonstrates that vre colonisation is not uncommon in the singapore patient population.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance from enterococci in a pediatric hospital. plasmids in enterococcus faecalis isolates with high-level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance.
AB  == background: enterococcus spp. is an important nosocomial and community-acquired pathogen. recent studies have documented the increasing importance of this pathogen in children, particularly in the hospital setting. our objective in this study was to report the frequency of antimicrobial resistance in enterococci and  to determine the characteristics of high-level gentamicin resistance (hlgr) plasmids in enterococcus faecalis clinical isolates. methods: two hundred eighty-nine enterococcal isolates were collected during an 18-month period from a tertiary-care pediatric hospital in mexico city. isolates were screened for antibiotic resistance, including hlgr. high-level, gentamicin-resistant e. faecalis strains were selected for pulsed-field electrophoresis (pfge) typing and plasmid analysis. transferability of resistance markers was carried out using filter matings. results: seventy-six percent of isolates were e. faecalis, 10% were e. avium, 5.2% e. faecium, 5.2% e. raffinossus, 1.38% e. malodoratus, 0.6% e. hirae, and 0.6% e. casseliflavus. antimicrobial resistance was ampicillin and  penicillin 29%, imipenem 17%, and vancomycin 3%, hlgr 5%. the following 15 high-level, gentamicin-resistant isolates were identified: six e. faecalis; four  e. avium; three e. faecium, and two e. casseliflavus. five of the six e. faecalis isolates were different by pfge and transferred gentamicin and streptomycin resistance on filter membranes. transfer frequencies ranged from 8.2 x 10(-4) to  6.92 x 10(-5) transconjugants/recipient cell. the plasmid content of donors and transconjugants were homogeneous (one plasmid of 47 kb). conclusions: in this pediatric hospital, antimicrobial resistance in enterococcus spp. is common. frequency of high-level, gentamicin-resistant strains is low. mechanism of hlgr appears to be due to a single plasmid dissemination.

TI  == occurrence of the vana and vanc2/c3 genes in enterococcus species isolated from poultry sources in malaysia.
AB  == enterococcus species isolated from poultry sources were characterized for their resistance to antibiotics, plasmid content, presence of van genes and their diversity by randomly amplified polymorphic dna-polymerase chain reaction (rapd-pcr). the results showed that all isolates were multi-resistance to the antibiotics tested. ampicillin (15/70) followed by chloramphenicol (37/70) were the most active antibiotics tested against the enterococcus spp. isolates, while  the overall resistant rates against the other antibiotics were between 64.3% to 100%. all vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis, e. durans, e. hirae and e. faecium isolates tested by the disk diffusion assay were positive in pcr detection for presence of vana gene. all e. casseliflavus isolates were positive for vanc2/c3 gene. however, none of the enterococcus spp. isolates were positive for vanb and  vanc1 genes. plasmids ranging in sizes between 1.1 to ca. 35.8 mda were detected  in 38/70 of the enterococcus isolates. when the genetic relationship among all isolates of the individual species were tested by rapd-pcr, genetic differences detected suggested a high genetic polymorphisms of isolates in each individual species. our results indicates that further epidemiological studies are necessary to elucidate the role of food animals as reservoir of vre and the public health significance of infections caused by enterococcus spp.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility and species identification for clinical isolates of  enterococci.
AB  == in order to describe the susceptibility patterns and determine the identities of  enterococcus spp. isolated at a regional teaching hospital in taichung during the period from june through november 1998, 96 clinical isolates of enterococci were  collected for further analysis. major sources of these isolates included urine, wound, and pus. species identification was performed using the api 20 strep system and supplemental tests. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of six antimicrobial agents were determined by e-test for each isolate. disk diffusion tests were also performed and the results were compared with those reported by the clinical laboratory. because gentamicin susceptibility tests showed inconsistent results in many isolates, mic determinations by the microbroth dilution method were also performed for these isolates. all isolates were tested for beta-lactamase production using the chromogenic method. the results showed that enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently encountered species (86.5%), followed by enterococcus faecium (7.3%), enterococcus avium (5.2%) and enterococcus casseliflavus (1.0%). the mic90 of ampicillin, penicillin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin for total isolates were 1, 3, 2, 0.25, 1, and more than 1024 microg/ml, respectively. all isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin. the same rate of resistance (3.1%) was found to penicillin, ampicillin and ciprofloxacin in all isolates. there were 50 (52%) and 48 (50%) isolates with high level streptomycin  and gentamicin resistance, respectively. the mic90 of ampicillin and penicillin for e. faecium were significantly higher than those for other species (96 and > 256 vs. < or = 1 and < or = 3 microg/ml, respectively); in fact, ampicillin or penicillin-resistance was only found in e. faecium. no organism was found to produce beta-lactamase. there were 29 isolates showing discrepant results between the study findings and clinical laboratory report for gentamicin susceptibility.  most isolates (27/ 29) reported as susceptible to gentamicin by the clinical laboratory showed a high level gentamicin resistance by mic determinations. the inconsistent results may be due to discrepancy in interpretations for heterogeneous resistance, bias in selecting colonies for the disk diffusion test, or variation in the quality of mueller-hinton agar used. the results suggest that any pure isolates growing some colonies within the inhibition zone should be considered as gentamicin resistant even if the zone diameter is equal or greater  than the susceptible breakpoint. in order to obtain accurate results, the gentamicin mic should be determined by the dilution method for enterococcal isolates that yield intermediate inhibition zones or zones just above the susceptible limit.

(< or = 11 mm, resistant; > or = 18 mm, susceptible), 5% of the vancomycin-resistant strains tested would have been considered fosfomycin resistant. minimal inhibitory concentrations of most vancomycin-resistant isolates were in the intermediate sensitivity range, yielding an mic50 of 32 mg/l and an mic90 of 64 mg/l. moreover the majority of inhibitory zone sizes by the disc diffusion method (din 58940) corresponded to intermediate susceptibility. these results suggest that fosfomycin at a high dosage and possibly used in combination with other drugs could be a potentially useful drug for the treatment of infections caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci.

TI  == evidence for horizontal gene transfer in evolution of elongation factor tu in enterococci.
AB  == the elongation factor tu, encoded by tuf genes, is a gtp binding protein that plays a central role in protein synthesis. one to three tuf genes per genome are  present, depending on the bacterial species. most low-g+c-content gram-positive bacteria carry only one tuf gene. we have designed degenerate pcr primers derived from consensus sequences of the tuf gene to amplify partial tuf sequences from 17 enterococcal species and other phylogenetically related species. the amplified dna fragments were sequenced either by direct sequencing or by sequencing cloned  inserts containing putative amplicons. two different tuf genes (tufa and tufb) were found in 11 enterococcal species, including enterococcus avium, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus dispar, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus malodoratus, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus pseudoavium, and enterococcus raffinosus. for  the other six enterococcal species (enterococcus cecorum, enterococcus columbae,  enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus sulfureus, enterococcus saccharolyticus, and  enterococcus solitarius), only the tufa gene was present. based on 16s rrna gene  sequence analysis, the 11 species having two tuf genes all have a common ancestor, while the six species having only one copy diverged from the enterococcal lineage before that common ancestor. the presence of one or two copies of the tuf gene in enterococci was confirmed by southern hybridization. phylogenetic analysis of tuf sequences demonstrated that the enterococcal tufa gene branches with the bacillus, listeria, and staphylococcus genera, while the enterococcal tufb gene clusters with the genera streptococcus and lactococcus. primary structure analysis showed that four amino acid residues encoded within the sequenced regions are conserved and unique to the enterococcal tufb genes and the tuf genes of streptococci and lactococcus lactis. the data suggest that an ancestral streptococcus or a streptococcus-related species may have horizontally  transferred a tuf gene to the common ancestor of the 11 enterococcal species which now carry two tuf genes.

AB  == the highly conserved central loop of domain v of 23s rna (nucleotides 2042 to 2628; escherichia coli numbering) is implicated in peptidyltransferase activity and represents one of the target sites for macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b antibiotics. dna encoding domain v (590 bp) of several species of enterococcus was amplified by pcr. twenty enterococcal isolates were tested, including enterococcus faecium (six isolates), enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus avium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus casseliflavus (two isolates of each), and enterococcus raffinosus, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus malodoratus, and enterococcus hirae (one isolate of each).  for all isolates, species identification by biochemical testing was corroborated  by 16s rrna gene sequencing. the sequence of domain v of the 23s rrna gene from e. faecium and e. faecalis differed from those of all other enterococci. the domain v sequences of e. durans and e. hirae were identical. this was also true for e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus. e. avium differed from e. casseliflavus by 23 bases, from e. durans by 16 bases, and from e. malodoratus by 2 bases. e. avium differed from e. raffinosus by one base. despite the fact that domain v is  considered to be highly conserved, substantial differences were identified between several enterococcal species.

TI  == identification of enterococcus species and phenotypically similar lactococcus and vagococcus species by reverse checkerboard hybridization to chaperonin 60 gene sequences.
AB  == data from four recent studies (s. h. goh et al., j. clin. microbiol. 36:2164-2166, 1998; s. h. goh et al., j. clin. microbiol. 34:818-823, 1996; s. h. goh et al., j. clin. microbiol. 35:3116-3121, 1997; a. y. c. kwok et al., int. j. syst. bacteriol. 49:1181-1192, 1999) suggest that an approximately 600-bp region  of the chaperonin 60 (cpn60) gene, amplified by pcr with a single pair of degenerate primers, has utility as a potentially universal target for bacterial identification (id). this cpn60 gene id method correctly identified isolates representative of numerous staphylococcal species and streptococcus iniae, a human and animal pathogen. we report herein that this method enabled us to distinguish clearly between 17 enterococcus species (enterococcus asini, enterococcus rattus, enterococcus dispar, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus durans, enterococcus cecorum, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus malodoratus, enterococcus raffinosus, enterococcus avium, enterococcus pseudoavium, enterococcus new sp. strain facklam, and enterococcus saccharolyticus), and vagococcus fluvialis, lactococcus lactis, and lactococcus garvieae. from 123 blind-tested samples, only two discrepancies were observed between the facklam and collins phenotyping method (r. r. facklam and m. d. collins, j. clin. microbiol. 27:731-734, 1989) and the cpn60 id method. in each case, the discrepancies were resolved in favor of the cpn60 id method. the species distributions of the 123 blind-tested isolates were enterococcus new sp.  strain facklam (atcc 700913), 3; e. asini, 1; e. rattus, 4; e. dispar, 2; e. gallinarum, 20; e. hirae, 9; e. durans, 9; e. faecalis, 12; e. mundtii, 3; e. casseliflavus, 8; e. faecium, 25; e. malodoratus, 3; e. raffinosus, 8; e. avium,  4; e. pseudoavium, 1; an unknown enterococcus clinical isolate, sp. strain r871;  vagococcus fluvialis, 4; lactococcus garvieae, 3; lactococcus lactis, 3; leuconostoc sp., 1; and pediococcus sp., 1. the cpn60 gene id method, coupled with reverse checkerboard hybridization, is an effective method for the identification of enterococcus and related organisms.

TI  == random amplification of polymorphic dna versus pulsed field gel electrophoresis of smai dna macrorestriction fragments for typing strains of vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == genetic typing of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) can be performed using a variety of methods, but comparative analyses of the quality of these methods are  still relatively scarce. we here compare random amplification of polymorphic dna  (rapd) analysis with pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge) of dna macrorestriction fragments as examples of two of the recent and well-accepted molecular typing methods. for the latter method, empirical guidelines for the interpretation of the dna fingerprints have been proposed in the international literature. based on our experimental analyses, we define similar criteria for rapd fingerprinting. a collection of 100 strains of vre, comprising enterococcus  faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus avium, enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus, was assembled. fifty isolates were dutch, another 50  were isolated in the uk. strains were selected on the basis of previously determined putative identity, close relatedness or uniqueness. the strains were analysed using well-standardised rapd and pfge protocols. resulting fingerprints  were interpreted with computerised methods involving band positioning and we show that typing of vre by pfge and rapd generates highly congruent dna fingerprint clustering. when the proposed international criteria for interpretation of pfge fingerprints were applied in our case, 86% pfge homology as discriminating value  between close relatedness and uniqueness, a 75% homology cut-off for the comparison of the rapd-generated dna fingerprints revealed essentially identical  strain clusters. as a spin-off it is revealed that strains from the different species can be efficiently discriminated, that strains from the uk and the netherlands form separate clusters and that strains from veterinary origin can be identified separately as well.

TI  == identification of enterococci at the species level by sequencing of the genes for d-alanine:d-alanine ligases.
AB  == a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate oligodeoxyribonucleotides allowed characterization of a fragment internal to the ddl genes encoding d-alanine:d-alanine ligases in enterococcus columbae, e. durans, e. malodoratus,  e. mundtii, e. raffinosus, e. seriolicida, e. solitarius, and e. sulfureus. phylogenetic analysis of the sequence of the amplification products and of those  already obtained from e. aviuni, e. casseliflavus, e. cecorum, e. dispar, e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. flavescens, e. gallinarurm, e. hirae, e. pseudoavium, and e. saccharolvticus yielded an evolutionary tree with a topology similar to that based on 16s rrna sequences. partial sequencing of the ddl gene can therefore be used for genotypic identification of enterococcus spp.

TI  == cost-effective algorithm for detection and identification of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in surveillance cultures.
AB  == a study was undertaken to develop an easy-to-use and cost-effective algorithm for the detection and identification of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) in surveillance cultures, because the incidence of vre outbreaks in institutions across canada has made continuous surveillance a necessity. enterococcus faecium  and enterococcus faecalis carry transferable resistance genes and hence are a problem for infection control. in laboratory surveillance, however, enterococcus  gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus, which exhibit low-level nontransferable resistance, are also encountered and often create confusion in identification. included in this study were a total of 218 strains of enterococci and other streptococci isolated from surveillance cultures. conventional methods  were used to determine their biochemical activities, and speciation was attempted in 121 strains using a rapid multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method that utilized primers for the vana, b, c1, c2/c3 and ddl genes. the results indicated that by using only a few tests (gram stain, pyrrolidonyl arylamidase activity, motility, xylose and methyl-alpha-d-glucopyranoside utilization), enterococcus faecium/faecalis strains could be accurately differentiated from enterococcus gallinarum/casseliflavus strains. for the 121 strains on which pcr was performed, there was a 100% correlation with the biochemical identification,  with the added advantage that the presence of van genes could be determined at the same time. the cost of identification using minimal biochemical testing and pcr was less than that of identification using automated systems or a battery of  conventional biochemical methods. the algorithm presented here may be used in the microbiology laboratory.

AB  == susceptibility to quinupristin/dalfopristin and other antibiotics was studied for clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) referred by uk hospitals between january 1997 and june 1999. single isolates of vre from 858 patients in 136 hospitals were received, of which 76% were enterococcus faecium and 21% were enterococcus faecalis, the remainder comprising minor species. most  isolates were multi-resistant. after allowing for the effect of blood, which raised the mics of quinupristin/dalfopristin four-fold, 98.3% of e. faecalis isolates and all the enterococcus avium, enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum appeared resistant to quinupristin/dalfopristin, whereas  98.8% of the e. faecium isolates and the single enterococcus raffinosus isolate were susceptible.

TI  == evaluation of a new system, vitek 2, for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of enterococci.
AB  == we evaluated the new automated vitek 2 system (biomerieux) for the identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of enterococci. the results obtained with the vitek 2 system were compared to those obtained by reference methods: standard identification by the scheme of facklam and sahm [r. r. facklam and d. f. sahm, p. 308-314, in p. r. murray et al., ed., manual of clinical microbiology, 6th ed., 1995] and with the api 20 strep system and, for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, broth microdilution and agar dilution methods by the procedures of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the presence of vana and vanb genes was determined by pcr. a total of  150 clinical isolates were studied, corresponding to 60 enterococcus faecalis, 55 enterococcus faecium, 26 enterococcus gallinarum, 5 enterococcus avium, 2 enterococcus durans, and 2 enterococcus raffinosus isolates. among those isolates, 131 (87%) were correctly identified to the species level with the vitek 2 system. approximately half of the misidentifications were for e. faecium with low-level resistance to vancomycin, identified as e. gallinarum or e. casseliflavus; however, a motility test solved the discrepancies and increased the agreement to 94%. among the strains studied, 66% were vancomycin resistant (57 vana, 16 vanb, and 26 vanc strains), 23% were ampicillin resistant (mics, >/=16 microgram/ml), 31% were high-level gentamicin resistant, and 45% were high-level streptomycin resistant. percentages of agreement for susceptibility and resistance to ampicillin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin and for high-level gentamicin resistance and high-level streptomycin resistance were 93, 95, 97, 97, and 96%, respectively. the accuracy of identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of enterococci with the vitek 2 system, together with the  significant reduction in handling time, will have a positive impact on the work flow of the clinical microbiology laboratory.

TI  == [drug resistance of 100 clinical strains of enterococcus spp].
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the drug susceptibility of 100 enterococcus spp. strains isolated from patients hospitalized in state clinical hospital no 1  in warsaw. all strains were identified (api 20 strep) and their susceptibility to antibiotics was tested (atb strep) in automatic atb system. additionally, pyrase  activity, beta-lactamase production (in nitrocefin test), mics for vancomycin and teicoplanin (e test), hlar--high level aminoglycoside resistance and susceptibility to vancomycin, teicoplanin, piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam (disc diffusion method) were determined. e. faecalis atcc 29212 was used as the control strain. fifty e. faecalis, 45 e. faecium, 2 e. casseliflavus, 2 e. durans and 1 e. avium strain were cultured. all strains were  pyrase-positive and beta-lactamase-negative. ten isolates demonstrated intermediate susceptibility to vancomycin (6--e. faecalis and 4--e. faecium). one e. faecalis strain was intermediately susceptible to both glycopeptides. one e. casseliflavus strain showed low-level resistance to vancomycin, but this strain was susceptible to teicoplanin--phenotype van c. hlar strains were found among 31 e. faecalis and 40 e. faecium strains. 48 e. faecalis strains were susceptible to piperacillin and 49 to piperacillin/tazobactam. whereas, 41 e. faecium were resistant to both these drugs. thirty six per cent of isolates were resistant to  penicillin and ampicillin, 73% to erythromycin, 87% to tetracycline, 89% to lincomycin and 56% to nitrofurantoin. some discrepancies were noticed between the results of different methods applied for susceptibility testing--atb system, e test and disc diffusion. these discrepancies concerned hlar detection and susceptibility to glycopeptides determination. the best methods were: disc-diffusion for hlar detection and e test for determination of resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin. increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents is observed in clinical enterococcus spp. isolates cultured in our laboratory, especially in e. faecium strains. it is necessary to control the dissemination of multiresistant enterococcus spp. strains in hospital wards.

TI  == eradication of vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium from a paediatric oncology unit and prevalence of colonization in hospitalized and community-based  children.
AB  == we previously reported an outbreak of vancomycin resistant enterococci (vre) in a paediatric oncology unit in december 1995 which was associated with widespread environmental contamination of the unit with vre. we undertook this study to evaluate the effectiveness of the infection control policy instituted subsequent  to the outbreak and to investigate the underlying prevalence of vre colonization  in hospitalized, outpatient and community-based children. we sought to establish  the molecular similarity of vre isolates from the study. stool specimens were obtained from outpatients at risk of vre, hospital inpatients and from healthy community-based children. vre colonization was eradicated from the inpatient unit within 11 months, but in outpatients, 16 months after the outbreak, 4 of 137 (2.9 %) attending oncology outpatients, 5 of 65 (7.7%) with cystic fibrosis and 1 of 12 (8.3 %) with liver disease were found to be colonized with vre. the isolates were all enterococcus faecium, van a phenotype except one e. casseliflavus of the van c phenotype. all were unique in smai dna macrorestriction patterns with the exception of two isolates, which were similar to the original outbreak strain and three further isolates of a single strain but which differed from the outbreak strain. of 315 hospital inpatients, 2.5 % were colonized with vre of the van c resistance phenotype but vre was not detected in 116 healthy, community-based children. we conclude that effective strategies can successfully control spread of vre but despite a low prevalence of vre colonization in hospital patients and  in community-based children, outbreaks can occur when infection control practices are not optimal. continued vigilance to detect vre and limit spread within hospitals is therefore necessary.

TI  == comparison of phenotypic methods to identify enterococci intrinsically resistant  to vancomycin (vanc vre).
AB  == clinical laboratories must be able to differentiate between enterococci possessing acquired resistance to vancomycin (vana and vanb genotypes) from those that are inherently resistant (vanc1 and vanc2/c3 genotypes). we compared several routine phenotypic tests to determine the species identity of clinical isolates of enterococci and a pcr assay for the van ligase genes was used to confirm identification of vanc vre. the vitek gram positive identification card identified 53/60 (88%) enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium isolates and 81/141 (57%) vanc vre without additional testing. another 32 of the vanc vre required additional testing (e.g., motility and pigmentation) for correct identification.  however, 7 of these 32 vanc vre were nonmotile. the rapid id 32 strep strips identified 50/60 (83%) e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates and 102/141 (72%) vanc vre. all e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates were nonmotile and did not acidify 1% methyl-alpha-d-glucopyranoside (mgp). only 93/115 (81%) e. gallinarum and 21/26 (81%) e. casseliflavus/e. flavescens were motile but all 141 vanc vre acidified mgp. mgp acidification can accurately differentiate vanc vre from e. faecalis and e. faecium. because some vanc vre isolates are nonmotile, mgp acidification is preferred as a simple and less costly test for identification of these isolates.

TI  == prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in fecal samples from hospitalized patients and nonhospitalized controls in a cattle-rearing area of france.
AB  == vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) have emerged as nosocomial pathogens over  the last decade, but little is known about their epidemiology. we report on the prevalence of vre fecal colonization on the basis of a prospective study among patients hospitalized in a hematology intensive care unit and among nonhospitalized subjects living in the local community. a total of 243 rectal swabs from hematology patients and 169 stool samples from the control group were  inoculated onto bile-esculin agar plates with and without 6 mg of vancomycin per  liter and into an enrichment bile-esculin broth supplemented with 4 mg of vancomycin per liter. a total of 37% of the hospitalized patients and 11.8% of the subjects from the community were found to be vre carriers. a total of 65 vre  strains were isolated: 12 (18.5%) e. faecium, 46 (70.7%) e. gallinarum, and 7 (10.8%) e. casseliflavus strains. no e. faecalis strains were detected. all the e. faecium strains were of the vana genotype. molecular typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed a different pattern for each vana vre strain that originated from an individual subject. to our knowledge, this is the first study  to be carried out in a cattle-rearing region of france. it reports a higher vre prevalence than that reported in previous european or u.s. studies. a partial explanation is the use of an enrichment broth step which enabled detection of strains which would otherwise have been missed, but the fact that subjects and patients were recruited from a predominantly agricultural area where vancomycin-related antibiotics have recently been used in animal husbandry could  also contribute to the high levels of vre in patients and subjects alike.

TI  == emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci at a university hospital in taiwan: persistence of multiple species and multiple clones.
AB  == objectives: to describe the epidemiology of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) in a university hospital in taipei, taiwan. design: retrospective review over a 27-month period, from march 1996 to may 1998. setting: a tertiary-care teaching hospital in taiwan. participants: patients with vre isolated from any body site. methods: patients were identified through hospital microbiology and infection control records. patient charts were reviewed for clinical and epidemiology data, including age, gender, previous hospital admissions, underlying diseases, types of infection, and recent antibiotic use. vre isolates  were characterized by their typical biochemical reactions, cellular fatty acid profiles, and the presence of van genes. antibiotypes using the e-test and randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) patterns of these isolates were used to determine the clonality. results: twenty-five isolates of vre recovered from 12 patients were identified. one patient with a perianal abscess had 12 isolates of  vre (4 enterococcus faecalis, 7 enterococcus faecium, and 1 enterococcus casseliflavus) recovered from perianal lesions. among 3 patients who were hospitalized in the same room, 1 had a community-acquired cellulitis over the left leg caused by e. faecalis, and the other 2 patients both had anal colonization with 2 isolates of e. faecalis. the other 8 patients had 1 e. faecalis isolate each from various clinical specimens. all isolates possessed vana resistance phenotype and vana genes. different antibiotypes and rapd patterns of the isolates from different patients excluded the possibility of nosocomial spread at the hospital. conclusions: multiple species of vre (e. faecalis, e. faecium, and e. casseliflavus) and multiple clones of e. faecium could colonize or infect hospitalized patients. in addition, clones of vre can persist long-term in patients' lower gastrointestinal tracts. these results extend our knowledge of the coexistence and the persistence of multiple species and multiple clones of vre in hospitalized patients.

AB  == traditional manufacture of bread from maize has been noted to play important roles from both economic and social standpoints; however, enforcement of increasingly strict hygiene standards requires thorough knowledge of the adventitious microbiota of the departing dough. to this goal, sourdough as well as maize and rye flours from several geographic locations and in two different periods within the agricultural year were assayed for their microbiota in sequential steps of quantification and identification. more than 400 strains were isolated and taxonomic differentiation between them was via biomerieux api galleries (375 of which were successfully identified) following preliminary biochemical and morphological screening. the dominant groups were yeasts and lactic acid bacteria (lab). the most frequently isolated yeasts were saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida pelliculosa. the most frequently isolated lab were (heterofermentative) leuconostoc spp. and (homofermentative) lactobacillus spp.; l. brevis, l. curvatus, and l. lactis ssp. lactis were the dominant species for the lactobacillus genera; lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis for lactococci; enterococcus casseliflavus, e. durans, and e. faecium for enterococci; and streptococcus constellantus and s. equinus for streptococci.

AB  == we isolated 1487 enterococcus species from 1200 stool specimens collected from high-risk patients in 12 canadian tertiary care hospitals between october 1995 and november 1996. the composition of the 1487 isolates was 601 vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus faecalis (40.4%), 667 vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus faecium (44.9%), 18 vancomycin-resistant (nine isolates mic 8-16 micrograms/ml; nine isolates mic > or = 32 micrograms/ml) e. faecium (vref) (1.2%), 95 vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus gallinarum (6.4%), 29 vancomycin-resistant (all mics 8-16 micrograms/ml) e. gallinarum (2.0%), and 77 vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus casseliflavus (5.2%). nine of the 18 vref isolates collected possessed the vana genotype and were from three patients at one hospital. two other vref isolates, of the vanb genotype, were from a single patient at a second hospital, and the remaining seven isolates, also all of the vanb genotype, were from five patients at a third hospital. all vref were ampicillin resistant (mic > or = 16 micrograms/ml), streptomycin resistant (mic > 1000 micrograms/ml), and ciprofloxacin resistant (mic > or = 4 micrograms/ml). ten of the 18 vref were also resistant to gentamicin (mic > 500 micrograms/ml), while all 18 isolates had quinupristin/dalfopristin mics < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. in conclusion, high-risk patients in tertiary care canadian hospitals are rarely  colonized (9/1200 patients, 0.75%) with vref in their lower gastrointestinal tract. these findings correlate well with the lack of reported vref infection in  high-risk patients in canadian hospitals. quinupristin/dalfopristin demonstrated  excellent in vitro activity against vref and other non-faecalis species of enterococcus, many of which also possessed high-level ampicillin, and/or high-level aminoglycoside, and/or ciprofloxacin resistance.

AB  == enterococci are becoming major nosocomial pathogens, and increasing resistance to vancomycin has been well documented. conventional identification methods, which are based on culturing, require 2 to 3 days to provide results. pcr has provided  a means for the culture-independent detection of enterococci in a variety of clinical specimens and is capable of yielding results in just a few hours. however, all pcr-based assays developed so far are species specific only for clinically important enterococci. we have developed a pcr-based assay which allows the detection of enterococci at the genus level by targeting the tuf gene, which encodes elongation factor ef-tu. initially, we compared the nucleotide sequences of the tuf gene from several bacterial species (available in public databases) and designed degenerate pcr primers derived from conserved regions. these primers were used to amplify a target region of 803 bp from four enterococcal species (enterococcus avium, e. faecalis, e. faecium, and e. gallinarum). subsequently, the complete nucleotide sequences of these amplicons were determined. the analysis of a multiple alignment of these sequences revealed regions conserved among enterococci but distinct from those of other bacteria. pcr primers complementary to these regions allowed amplification of genomic dnas  from 14 of 15 species of enterococci tested (e. solitarius dna could not be amplified). there was no amplification with a majority of 79 nonenterococcal bacterial species, except for 2 abiotrophia species and several listeria species. furthermore, this assay efficiently amplified all 159 clinical isolates of enterococci tested (61 e. faecium, 77 e. faecalis, 9 e. gallinarum, and 12 e. casseliflavus isolates). interestingly, the preliminary sequence comparison of the amplicons for four enterococcal species demonstrated that there were some sequence variations which may be used to generate species-specific internal probes. in conclusion, this rapid pcr-based assay is capable of detecting all clinically important enterococci and has potential for use in clinical microbiology laboratories.

TI  == vancomycin-resistant enterococci isolates from the rumen content of deer.
AB  == the total enumeration of enterococci from the rumen content of deer, their species determination, resistance to antibiotics with the predominant importance  of vancomycin resistance, and their metabolic properties, were examined. enterococci (2.0 x 10(2) cfu per ml) encountered from the rumen of deer were phenotypically allotted to the species enterococcus casseliflavus (26.6%), e. gallinarum (26.6%) and e. faecium (6.6%). the other isolates were not phenotypically specified. although the resistance to the other antibiotics was recorded, the emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in a high percentage  (60%) was revealed. the majority of strains (80%) were multiresistant with the predominant resistance shown by vancomycin. these strains produced lactic acid in the range from 0.258 mol l-1 up to 0.489 mol l-1, and most of the isolates (53.3%) manifested medium urease activity. vancomycin-resistant enterococci were  selected for other studies such as plasmid determination and bacteriocin production, and to assess their value as indicators of faecal contamination.

TI  == comparison of direct and enrichment methods for the selective isolation of vancomycin-resistant enterococci from feces of pigs and poultry.
AB  == isolation results of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) of fecal samples from pigs and broiler and layer chickens obtained with two vancomycin-supplemented enrichment media, kanamycin aesculin azide (kaa) broth and enterococcosel (ecc) broth, and three isolation media, kaa agar, ecc agar, and slanetz and bartley (sl) agar, were compared. direct isolation on vancomycin-containing agar plates was not efficient in swine and layer chickens, which had only low numbers of vre. in broilers chickens, the vre content of the samples was high, and sl as well as  ecc were found to perform better than kaa agar. the same three agar media were used as selective plating media after 1 and 2 days incubation of the samples in kaa and ecc enrichment broths. sensitivities of the 12 different enrichment-plate combinations tested ranged from 0 to 81% in layer chickens and from 5 to 44% in samples from pigs. in the high prevalence type of samples from broilers, sensitivities still varied substantially from 52 to 78%. incubating vancomycin-containing enrichment broths for 2 days compared with 1 day was favorable for the isolation of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, e. gallinarum, and e. casseliflavus but not for e. faecium and e. hirae/e. durans. ecc broth and ecc plates yielded the highest number of e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus. in layer as well as in broiler chickens, ecc broth incubated for 2 days and plated on ecc agar was the most sensitive method. in pigs, however, kaa  broth incubated for 2 days and plated on ecc medium yielded the highest number of vre.

TI  == cloning of insertion sequence is1485 from enterococcus species.
AB  == we have cloned and identified an insertion sequence, is1485, that was present in  several members of the genus enterococcus. is1485 exists in varying copy numbers  with at least 12 copies in e. durans (atcc 11576), 3 copies in e. faecium (atcc 19434), and one copy each in e. faecalis (atcc 19433) and e. avium (atcc 14024).  it was also detected in clinical strains of e. gallinarum, e. casseliflavus, and  e. saccharolyticus. is1485 is 1366 bp in length, it has imperfect terminal inverted repeats with 25 of the terminal 39 residues matched, and it contains three open reading frames exceeding 50 codons, designated orfa, orfb, and orfc. the largest, orfb, was located 36 bp downstream and in the -1 reading frame relative to orfa; orfc is oriented in the opposite direction and overlaps orfa. the genetic organization of is1485 resembles that of members of the is3 family of transposable elements. sequence homology exists with several members of the is3 family especially with is199 from streptococcus mutans.

TI  == identification of clinically isolated vancomycin-resistant enterococci: comparison of api and bbl crystal systems.
AB  == twenty-eight phenotypically separate strains of clinically isolated vancomycin-resistant enterococci have been investigated with two api identification kit systems (20 strep and rapid id 32 strep) and two bbl crystal kits (gram positive and rapid gram positive). all strains were identified as enterococcus faecium by a reference laboratory. the rapid id 32 kit positively identified 15 of 28 strains (54%), but only two (7%) were identified correctly: 11 were identified as 'doubtful' or 'to genus level' and two gave 'unacceptable'  profiles. the api 20 strep kit identified 27 strains (96%), but only 16 (57%) were identified correctly as e. faecium. the rapid id 32 kit erred by either positively misidentifying vancomycin-resistant e. faecium as e. casseliflavus or  e. gallinarum, or indicated that this was the most likely identification, while the api 20 strep kit more commonly produced a misidentification as e. casseliflavus. the crystal gram positive and rapid gram positive kits correctly identified 26 (93%) and 27 (96%) of the strains, respectively.

TI  == practical approach to the identification of clinically relevant enterococcus species.
AB  == enterococci have become important nosocomial pathogens, with enterococcus faecalis and then enterococcus faecium predominating. because of the emergence of glycopeptide (vancomycin and teicoplanin) resistance in enterococci, laboratories have been required to screen for resistant strains and to identify them to the species level. this has resulted in the need for accurate identification of species less commonly associated with clinical infections, such as enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum, which are inherently resistant to the  glycopeptides. studies evaluating commonly used commercial identification systems, have found error rates for enterococcal species identification of 2-21%  for e. faecalis, 5-9% for e. faecium, and 14-79% for other species. reporting errors may have adverse effects on the management of clinical infections, as well as in the control of multidrug-resistant strain outbreaks. the purpose of this document is to present a simplified approach to the identification of enterococcus species that uses a combination of rapid, readily available, and inexpensive tests.

TI  == [susceptibilities of enterococcus faecium, prsp and mrsa to rp59500 and their correlations with those to other drugs].
AB  == investigations on emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref) which has recently been attracting attention, especially in the western countries, have been conducted in japan. a total of 1,239 isolates of e. faecium  were collected from 19 institutions during the period of april 1995 and june 1996, in the purpose of evaluating susceptibilities to variety of antimicrobial agents, including rp59500 and vancomycin (vcm), and detecting vancomycin-resistant genes (van genes). susceptibilities of penicillin-resistant  streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp) and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) were also studied. as a result, 2 isolates of e. faecium were found to be  moderately resistant to vcm showing mic of 8 micrograms/ml though the final identification in species level and the detection of van genes by pcr method have not been completed. on the other hand there detected no mrsa nor prsp showing moderately resistant or resistant to vcm. it was concluded that rp59500 and vcm possessed favorable activity against clinically isolated e. faecium, prsp and mrsa. among other species of enterococci, moderately resistant strains to vcm showing mic of 8 micrograms/ml were detected; 10 isolates of e. gallinarum, 4 of  e. casseliflavus and 2 of e. flavescens. in those isolates, vanc1 and vanc2 were  detected by pcr, and vanb was also detected in a isolates of e. gallinarum simultaneously.

TI  == comparison of direct plating and broth enrichment culture for the detection of intestinal colonization by glycopeptide-resistant enterococci among hospitalized  patients.
AB  == the results of prevalence studies on glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (gre) in  the intestine may be influenced by the detection methods applied. in most studies different media, different concentrations of antibiotics, and different methods are used, and these differences result in differences in recovery rates. in this  cross-sectional study on the carrier state of gre among patients at the university hospital antwerp, antwerp, belgium, performed on 21 may 1996, direct plating and broth enrichment were compared by using the same media. stool samples (n = 213) or rectal swabs (n = 122) were plated directly on enterococcosel agar (biomerieux) and after enrichment in enterococcosel broth. the prevalence of gre  was 12.8%. direct plating recovered 53.4% of the gre isolates, and broth enrichment recovered an additional 46.5% of them; in the latter test the isolates were thus present at less than 10(3) cfu per g of feces. the prevalence of gre among dialysis patients was higher than among the other patients, but the difference was not significant (p = 0.06), possibly as a result of the small numbers of dialysis patients examined. the gre species isolated included 19 e. gallinarum (44.2%), 13 e. faecium (30.2%), 6 e. faecalis (13.9%), and 5 e. casseliflavus (11.6%) isolates. all e. faecalis and e. faecium strains isolated carried the vana gene, and e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus carried the vanc1 and vanc2 gene, respectively. the majority of isolates were polyclonal. our data  indicate that the rate of detection of gre from both stool samples and rectal swabs is significantly increased with enrichment cultures.

TI  == comparison of simple and rapid methods for identifying enterococci intrinsically  resistant to vancomycin.
AB  == three different methodologies, reduction of litmus milk (lm) and acidification of arabinose (ara), acidification of methyl-alpha-d-glucopyranoside (mgp), and rapid motility (rm), for differentiating isolates of enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum (intrinsically vancomycin-resistant enterococci [ivre]) from enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium were evaluated. all 33 isolates of e. faecalis tested reduced lm within 4 h and were negative in all other tests, while the 53 isolates of e. faecium were ara positive only. in contrast, 45 of 46 (98%) ivre isolates examined (26 e. casseliflavus and 20 e. gallinarum isolates) acidified mgp, 41 of 46 (89%) were lm and ara positive, and  45 of 46 (98%) were rm positive. acidification of mgp was therefore the single most useful test for differentiating ivre from vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and e. faecalis; however, a combination of lm-ara and rm testing enabled the correct designation of organisms without the need for overnight incubation.

TI  == heterogeneity of resistance elements in clinical isolates of enterococci with high-level gentamicin resistance.
AB  == high-level resistance (minimum inhibitory concentration, mic > 1,000 micrograms/ml) to gentamicin (hlgr) in enterococci is common in taiwan. in this study, we investigated the distribution of gentamicin resistance elements in enterococci isolated at national taiwan university hospital in a 1-year period, and also examined the transfer and the genetic variability of the resistance elements of different isolates. among 109 isolates tested, 43 (39%) hlgr isolates were identified. hlgr was most common in enterococcus faecium isolates (7/15, 47%), followed by enterococcus faecalis (34/80, 43%), enterococcus avium (1/5, 20%), and enterococcus casseliflavus (1/9, 11%). to understand the mechanism of resistance transfer, four isolates of e. faecalis and five isolates of e. faecium showing hlgr were studied. transfer of resistance markers to a plasmid-free recipient strain of e. faecalis jh2-7 was observed, with transfer frequencies ranging from 10(-2) to 10(-8). all of the transconjugants contained plasmids, with sizes ranging from 45 kb to larger than 70 kb. at least three plasmid patterns were observed on digestion with haeiii. hybridization with a probe specific for the aac6'aph2" gentamicin resistance gene confirmed that all of these hlgr isolates carried a gm(r) determinant, though the hybridization patterns of the plasmids from e. faecalis and e. faecium were different. although many similarities exist among enterococcal gm(r) determinants, the results suggest heterogeneity may occur in the flanking regions of resistance elements.

TI  == the effect of ph on the inhibition of bacterial growth by physiological concentrations of butyric acid: implications for neonates fed on suckled milk.
AB  == butyric acid is released from milk by pre-intestinal lipases during suckling. it  is also known to inhibit bacterial growth. to investigate whether butyric acid may be a significant factor in controlling bacterial growth in the stomach of pre-weaned animals, the ability of butyric acid to inhibit growth of selected bacteria was tested over physiological ranges of ph and butyric acid concentrations. six enteric and environmental strains of bacteria were used: two  strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus casseliflavus. at ph 4.5 and 5.0, the growth of all organisms was significantly inhibited in the presence of butyrate,  and in some cases growth was completely arrested. at ph 6.0, butyric acid did not affect bacterial growth until the concentration reached 40 mm. the maximum concentration of butyric acid available in cow's milk after incubation with pre-gastric lipase is approximately 16 mm, which would be sufficient to prevent growth of the organisms tested at ph values occurring in the stomach. therefore,  butyric acid inhibition of bacterial growth may explain in part, the role of pre-intestinal lipases in young animals' natural defenses against bacteria in ingested food prior to weaning.

TI  == effect of vancomycin on intestinal flora of patients who previously received antimicrobial therapy.
AB  == to evaluate the ecological disturbances of peroral vancomycin administration following cephalosporin administration, 20 healthy volunteers received cefuroxime axetil tablets (250 mg) perorally twice a day for 1 week, and 10 of these volunteers subsequently received vancomycin capsules (125 mg) perorally four times daily for 7 days. the concentration of vancomycin in feces after 1 week of  vancomycin administration was high (mean +/- sd, 520 +/- 197 mg/kg), which correlated with the ecological disturbances noted in the vancomycin recipients. vancomycin administration resulted in a rapid decrease in the numbers of intestinal enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus durans (p < or = .05), while there was a significant emergence of motile enterococci with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin (enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus; minimum inhibitory concentration, 4-16 mg/l) (p < or  = .01). because of vancomycin administration, there was also a significant overgrowth of vancomycin-resistant pediococcus species and lactobacilli as well as of klebsiella species, citrobacter species, and enterobacter species (p < or = .01). the numbers of bifidobacteria and bacteroides species were significantly reduced during vancomycin administration. none of the enterococcal strains carried vana or vanb. twenty-two of the 27 motile enterococci carried the vanc-1  gene specific for e. gallinarum, whereas five strains carried the vanc-2(c-3) gene, thus implicating that they were e. casseliflavus or enterococcus flavescens.

AB  == surveillance cultures for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and subsequent characterization of the isolates can be extremely burdensome and difficult. therefore, efficient and reliable schemes for the characterization of surveillance isolates are needed. in this study, a commercial agar (bile esculin  azide agar with 6 microg of vancomycin per ml [beaa]; remel, lenexa, kans.) was used in the initial screening step to establish relatively rapid (i.e., in < or = 24 h from the time of isolation) phenotype-based and pcr-based schemes for the detection and characterization of vre. the phenotype-based scheme included gram staining of growth on beaa and subculture of cocci on sheep blood agar plates for vancomycin disk diffusion and pyrazinamidase (pyr) testing. for the pcr scheme, inocula for van gene detection were taken directly from the beaa plates. the phenotypic approach was applied to 378 surveillance cultures that yielded growth  on beaa. gram staining quickly eliminated gram-positive bacilli from further testing, and a negative pyr test classified 25 additional isolates as probable pediococci. a positive pyr test reliably identified 121 single-patient vre isolates that included 83 enterococcus faecium, 33 e. gallinarum, and 5 e. casseliflavus strains. the vancomycin inhibition zone size clearly distinguished  vana and vanb strains from vanc strains within 24 h of beaa isolation. all vana and vanb strains failed to produce zones of >6 mm, while only one vanc strain produced a zone of < 15 mm. challenging this phenotypic scheme with 47 stock vre  isolates produced similar findings. in direct pcr analyses, false-negative vana and vanb results occurred with 12% of the specimens. many of the false-negative reactions also failed to produce an internal control product, which underscores the need for including control primers when a pcr scheme is used. in summary, the phenotype- and the pcr-based schemes provide efficient methods for characterizing vre within 24 h of isolation.

TI  == surveillance for antimicrobial resistance in enterococci.
AB  == aim: to describe antimicrobial resistance patterns of enterococcus species in auckland. background: antimicrobial resistant enterococci have emerged as major nosocomial pathogens in overseas hospitals. it is recommended that hospitals perform periodic surveys to determine local enterococcal resistance patterns. methods: enterococcal isolates from four patient groups were tested: group i were recovered from routine clinical specimens; group ii were stool isolates from patients at risk of having vancomycin resistant enterococci, eg, intensive care unit patients, patients receiving vancomycin, and immunocompromised patients receiving antibiotics; group iii were enterococci from stool specimens sent for clostridium difficile toxin testing; group iv were isolates from stool specimens  submitted to a community laboratory for enteric pathogen testing. all enterococci isolated were tested for the presence of beta-lactamase, susceptibility to amoxycillin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, and for high level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance. results: there were 121 group i enterococcal isolates. 628 stool specimens were cultured. enterococci were isolated from: 76/148 (51%) group ii specimens; 166/279 (60%) group iii specimens; and 70/201 (35%) of group  iv specimens. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on 433 isolates; 74% were e faecalis, 12% e faecium, 6% e gallinarum/casseliflavus group and 8% other enterococcal species. no isolate produced beta-lactamase. all e faecalis were susceptible to amoxycillin. two e faecium and one enterococcus species were  resistant to amoxycillin (mics all 16 mg/l). all isolates were susceptible to teicoplanin. fourteen e gallinarum/casseliflavus group isolates had intermediate  susceptibility to vancomycin (mics of 8 mg/l). one e faecium had intermediate susceptibility to vancomycin (mic 8 mg/l). high level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance occurred in 64 (15%) and 50 (12%) isolates respectively. conclusion: vancomycin resistance is rare and is essentially restricted to species that are rarely clinical pathogens, i.e., e casseliflavus and e gallinarum. our results have established the local susceptibility profile for enterococcal isolates. this allows comparison with other locations and the detection of emerging trends of resistance.

TI  == [vancomycin resistant enterococci in austria].
AB  == this study reports pheno- and genotypical analysis of 9 isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and 5 vancomycin-sensitive enterococci (vse) in austria: 5 e, faecium isolates of 4 patients (the sole patients demonstrating vre at the university hospital of innsbruck in 1994 and 1995), 3 glycopeptide-sensitive isolates collected in innsbruck in february 1996 for epidemiological analysis, and 6 enterococcus isolates from the university hospitals of vienna and graz. the pheno- and genotypical analyses of all glycopeptide highly resistant e. faecium and e. faecalis isolates indicated the presence of vana type resistance. one e. casseliflavus strain with intrinsic vanc-1 resistance showed a characteristic constitutive low-level resistance to vancomycin and susceptibility to teicoplanin. genotyping with macro-restriction analysis demonstrated that 3 vre isolates of the 5 e. faecium specimens were identical; the same applied to 2 vse isolates. the two patients with vre had been cared for at the same time in a surgical icu and likewise, the two patients with  vse were simultaneously treated at a neurological icu. the genotyping of e. faecalis strains showed that two strains of the three vre isolates exhibited identical patterns. epidemiological investigation did not reveal a mode of transmission for this cluster. two of the 8 patients with vre died within 60 days after isolation of the bacteria; the doctors in charge did not consider that the  enterococci had been the cause of death. the results of our study indicate that oral vancomycin administration to humans is a primary cause of vre in austrian hospitals. in austria approximately 66 kg vancomycin, 20% of it given orally, are administered to patients per year. approx. 18-20 tons avotan (active ingredient avoparcin-10%)/year were used in austria; as of april 1, 1997 the use of this animal foodstuff supplement is prohibited by the european commission.

TI  == species identification of enterococci via intergenic ribosomal pcr.
AB  == accurate species identification of enterococci has become important with the wide prevalence of acquired vancomycin resistance and the presence of less epidemiologically important, inherently vancomycin-resistant enterococci. using a collection of enterococcal strains, we found that pcr amplification of the intergenic spacer (its-pcr) between the 16s and 23s rrna genes can produce amplicon profiles characteristic of the enterococcus examined. the species examined were group i enterococci (enterococcus avium, enterococcus raffinosus, enterococcus malodoratus, and enterococcus pseudoavium), group ii enterococci (enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus mundtii, and enterococcus gallinarum), and group iii enterococci (enterococcus durans and enterococcus hirae). the enterococcal species in group i, as well as e. faecalis and two strains of e. hirae, were similar and therefore had to be differentiated from each other by sau3a restriction digests. this produced patterns characteristic of each of these species. the remaining group ii and group iii enterococcal species produced amplicons characteristic of a particular species except e. gallinarum. the pcr products from e. gallinarum displayed strain-to-strain heterogeneity in the number and size of amplicons. to  further test the utility of this technique, 11 phenotypically aberrant strains which had been assigned species identification based on facklam and collins-type  strain reactions (r.r. facklam and m.d. collins, j. clin. microbiol. 27:731-734,  1989) were subjected to its-pcr. its-pcr of the phenotypically aberrant strains identified six strains with reactions consistent with those of type strains. however, five strains were characterized as follows: two strains originally identified as e. mundtii were identified by its-pcr as e. casseliflavus, one strain originally identified as e. raffinosus was identified by its-pcr as e. durans, one strain originally identified as e. hirae was identified by its-pcr as e. faecium [corrected]. we conclude that amplification of the intergenic 23s and  16s rrna gene regions of enterococci provides a reliable technique for species identification of enterococci.

TI  == colonization by vancomycin-resistant enterococci of the intestinal tract of patients in intensive care units from french general hospitals.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the prevalence of fecal carriage of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) by patients hospitalized in intensive care units from 24 french general hospitals. methods: rectal swabs were obtained from 647 patients hospitalized in intensive care units during the month of june 1994 and plated on  agar medium selective for vancomycin-resistant enterococci. the glycopeptide resistance phenotypes and genotypes of the enterococci detected were characterized. results: thirty-two of 647 patients (4.9%) carried vre. thirteen strains (2%) were identified as enterococcus faecium and 19 (2.9%) as enterococcus gallinarum or enterococcus casseliflavus. none of these strains was  highly resistant to gentamicin. the e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus strains contained the vanc1 and vanc2 genes, respectively. the e. faecium strains were highly resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin and carried the vana gene. no infection due to vre was observed during the study period. pulsed-field gel analysis of total dna following digestion with smai or kspi from 13 vana-type e.  faecium strains revealed intra- and inter-hospital strain heterogeneity. however, the finding of isolates with indistinguishable pulsed-field types within the same ward and in two medical centers suggests patient-to-patient transmission or a common source. four e. faecium strains were isolated within 48 h after admission  of patients. conclusions: these results indicate that vre form part of the normal flora of patients and that, despite the actual scarcity of infections due to vre, there is a potential risk for dissemination of these strains in french hospitals.

TI  == evaluation of arbitrarily primed pcr analysis and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of large genomic dna fragments for identification of enterococci  important in human medicine.
AB  == the increasing problems encountered with enterococcal nosocomial infections and the intrinsic and acquired resistance of the enterococci to different antimicrobial compounds highlight the need for a rapid identification technique.  enterococcus faecalis is readily identified by biochemical tests, but species differentiation within the enterococcus faecium and enterococcus gallinarum species groups is less well established. in the present study, 66 strains representing the most prevalent human enterococci were used to develop a pcr-based species-specific identification protocol. whole-cell protein analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used as a reference method for species identification. in addition, the genomic smai macro-restriction fragment distribution of all of the strains was examined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). oligonucleotide d11344-primed pcr was as discriminative as whole-cell protein analysis and resulted in more easily interpreted band patterns. this pcr-based technique allowed identification of clinical isolates by visual examination of the dna profiles obtained. the inability of both methods to discriminate between enterococcus casseliflavus and  enterococcus flavescens brought into question the species status of e. flavescens. pfge did not result in species-discriminative dna bands or band patterns, but proved to be superior for interpretation of interstrain relationships.

TI  == multiplex pcr detection of vana, vanb, vanc-1, and vanc-2/3 genes in enterococci.
AB  == vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) are increasingly isolated from clinical specimens. one hundred clinical isolates of enterococci (e. casseliflavus/e. flavescens [n = 10], e. faecalis [n = 34], e. faecium [n = 43], e. avium [n = 1], e. gallinarum [n = 11], and e. raffinosus [n = 1]) were examined for the presence of vana, vanb, vanc-1, and vanc-2/3 genes by a single multiplex pcr performed directly with colonies from blood agar plates. six previously characterized vre strains which carry either vana, vanb, vanc-1, or vanc-2 genes were used as controls. to discriminate among van genes, the pcr amplicons were digested with mspi and were electrophoresed on agarose gels. because of significant sequence homology between vanc-2 and vanc-3 genes, this assay is unable to discriminate these genes from each other; therefore, these are referred to as vanc-2/3 genes.  pcr products were detected in 63 of the 100 clinical isolates. the restriction fragment length patterns were consistent with vana for 10 strains, vanb for 30 strains, vanc-1 for 12 strains, vanc-2 for 6 strains, and vana and vanc-1 for 1 strain. the vancomycin mics for the isolates with restriction fragment length patterns consistent with vana and vanb were all > and = 64 micrograms/ml. the vancomycin mics for the isolates with restriction fragment length patterns consistent with vanc-1 or vanc-2 were 4 to 8 micrograms/ml. the vancomycin mics for the isolates from which no pcr amplicons were produced were 2 to 4 micrograms/ml. a pcr product was produced in four isolates (vancomycin mics, 4 to > 256 micrograms/ml) with restriction fragment length patterns differing from those for the control vana, vanb, vanc-1, and vanc-2 isolates. dna sequencing of  these amplicons revealed that two of the four isolates had nucleic acid sequences which were closely related to the published sequence for the vanb gene and two had nucleic acid sequences which were closely related to the published sequence for the vanc-2 and vanc-3 genes. multiplex pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism appears to be a useful and convenient method for rapidly detecting and discriminating genotypes for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. in the clinical laboratory. in instances in which unusual restriction fragment patterns  of pcr amplicons occur, dna sequencing can be performed to discriminate van genotypes.

TI  == distribution and characterization of enterococcus species in municipal sewages.
AB  == the occurrence, distribution and characterization of enterococci in municipal sewages from two geographically different regional sewage treatment plants in east slovakia was studied. the total counts of enterococci in samples varied from 10(4) to 10(6) cfu/ml. the vast majority of the strains identified were enterococcus faecium (50%), with e. gallinarum (25.5%) and e. casseliflavus (10.1%). the species which accounted for 14.4% of the cultures were not specified. lactic acid production from twenty isolates ranged from 0.085 mol l-1  to 0.914 mol l-1. urease activity ranged from 1.21 nkat ml-1 to 10.49 nkat ml-1.  the strains were resistant to at least one (except for vancomycin) and at most to six antibiotics tested. the majority of isolates were biresistant. although nine  strains were without bacteriocin production, the other strains inhibited the growth of enterococcal as well as staphylococcal isolates. e. faecium al 40 produced bacteriocin which inhibited the growth of all indicators reaching 12 mm  zones of inhibition. e. faecium was the most prevalent species in all samples, but the source position of isolates as well as the sewage composition did not affect enterococcal distribution. the ability of isolates to produce bacteriocin  indicates their possible use in biotechnological environmental processes.

TI  == pseudo-outbreak of enterococcus durans infections and colonization associated with introduction of an automated identification system software update.
AB  == enterococci are an important cause of hospital-acquired infections. since 1989, there has been an increase in the number of nosocomial enterococcal infections caused by strains resistant to vancomycin in the united states. although many enterococcal species can colonize humans, only enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, e. raffinosus, and e. casseliflavus have been implicated in clusters of infection. in january 1996, the centers for disease control and prevention received a report of an outbreak of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in which 31  of 84 (36.9%) isolates were identified as e. durans. twenty-nine isolates identified as e. durans were identified to the species level after the introduction of an automated identification system software update (vitek gram-positive identification card, version r09.1) for the identification of species of gram-positive organisms. when seven isolates initially reported as e.  durans were identified to the species level by alternate methods, they were found to be e. faecium. subsequently, isolates identified as e. durans by the automated system were reidentified by using a rapid streptococcus test, and no further enterococcal isolate has been confirmed as e. durans. automated microbial analysis is a potential source of error that is not easily recognized. when laboratory findings are discordant with expected clinical or epidemiologic patterns, confirmatory testing by alternate methods should be performed.

AB  == certain derivatives of the glycopeptide antibiotic ly264826 with n-alkyl-linked substitutions on the epivancosamine sugar are active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci. six compounds representing our most active series were evaluated for activity against antibiotic-resistant, gram-positive pathogens. for enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis resistant to both vancomycin  and teicoplanin, the mics of the six semisynthetic compounds for 90% of the strains tested were 1 to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 2,048 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 256 micrograms/ml for ly264826. for e. faecium and e. faecalis resistant to vancomycin but not teicoplanin, the mics were 0.016 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 64 to 1,024 micrograms/ml for vancomycin. the compounds were highly active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and against e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus and showed some activity against isolates of highly vancomycin-resistant leuconostocs and pediococci. the mics for 90% of the strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus tested were typically 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 microgram/ml for vancomycin. against methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis mics ranged from 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 to 4 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 4 to 16 micrograms/ml for teicoplanin. the spectrum of these new compounds included activity against teicoplanin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci. the compounds exhibited exceptional potency against pathogenic streptococci, with mics of < or = 0.008 microgram/ml against streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant isolates. in in vivo studies with a mouse infection model, the median effective doses against a challenge by s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, or s. pyogenes were typically 4 to 20 times lower than those of vancomycin. overall, these new glycopeptides, such as ly307599 and ly333328, show promise for use as agents against resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.

AB  == recently, in escherichia coli was cloned a sau3ai 3.4-kb fragment containing the  gene encoding for penicillin-binding protein 5 (pbp5) of enterococcus faecalis. the structural gene for the pbp of e. faecalis and the flanking regions were entirely sequenced (c. signoretto, m. boaretti, and p. canepari, fems microbiol.  lett. 123:99-106, 1994). when the entire cloned e. faecalis dna insert, labeled with digoxigenin, was used as a probe to detect a homology gene in enterococci, it was observed that only dnas of all the e. faecalis strains reacted to the probe. the same results were obtained when a hindiii fragment of 0.35 kb from the entire insert of 3.4 kb was used. in this study we tested a total of 62 clinically isolated enterococcal strains, belonging to the species e. faecalis (36 strains), e. faecium (13), e. gallinarum (6), e. bovis (2) e. avium (3), e. hirae (1), and e. casseliflavus (1). the results indicate that both the entire segment and the hindiii fragment may be useful for preparing a species-specific probe for rapid identification of e. faecalis species.

TI  == unorthodox antibiotic combinations including ciprofloxacin against high-level gentamicin resistant enterococci.
AB  == development of high-level gentamicin resistance among enterococci represents a serious therapeutic problem as it precludes synergy between aminoglycosides and cell-wall active agents. as part of a search for active antibiotic combinations against enterococci with high-level gentamicin resistance, we tested by the time  kill curve method the efficacy of ciprofloxacin combined with ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, vancomycin or teicoplanin against ten isolates of enterococcus faecium, three of enterococcus casseliflavus and 13 of enterococcus  faecalis that exhibited a mic of gentamicin > or = 2000 mg/l. most of the e. faecium were also resistant to ampicillin and to ciprofloxacin. the combination of ciprofloxacin with ampicillin was bactericidal against five of seven e. faecium strains that exhibited a ciprofloxacin mic < or = 4 mg/l, but was inactive against the three e. faecium that were highly resistant to ciprofloxacin. this combination was also bactericidal against the e. casseliflavus and all the e. faecalis strains. the combination of ciprofloxacin with trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole was bactericidal against five of the seven e. faecium and seven of the nine e. faecalis strains with a ciprofloxacin mic < or = 4 mg/l. no bactericidal activity of this combination was seen against the enterococci that were highly resistant to either ciprofloxacin or to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. the combination of ciprofloxacin with glycopeptides was inactive against e. faecium and e. casseliflavus and against e. faecalis, it was either ineffective or antagonistic; in only one case it was bactericidal. five strains of e. faecium were resistant to all antibiotic combinations tested.

TI  == species identification and antibiotic susceptibility of enterococci isolated from clinical specimens of hospitalized patients.
AB  == over a 4-month period, a total of 315 enterococci were isolated from various clinical specimens of hospitalized patients. by applying an array of biochemical  tests, all strains were accurately identified to the species level, and their susceptibilities to clinically relevant antibiotics were determined by a standardized agar dilution technique. e. faecalis and e. faecium accounted for 87.3% and 9.2% of isolates, respectively. e. avium (1%), e. gallinarum (1%), e. durans (0.6%), e. hirae (0.6%), and e. casseliflavus (0.3%) isolates were also identified. eleven strains of e. faecium and 1 e. hirae isolate were resistant to ampicillin, but none of the isolates produced beta-lactamase. twenty-three e. faecium and 3 e. faecalis strains as well as 1 e. hirae isolate revealed imipenem resistance. a total of 25.4% enterococci (60 e. faecalis and 19 e. faecium isolates, 1 e. hirae strain) were erythromycin-resistant. twelve strains (11 e. faecium and 1 e. avium) exhibited ciprofloxacin resistance. high-level resistance to streptomycin was found in 58 (21.1%) e. faecalis, 9 (31%) e. faecium, and both e. hirae strains, whereas high-level gentamicin resistance (hlgr) was exclusively seen in the species e. faecalis (11.6% of isolates belonging to this species). a  simple agar screening test containing 500 micrograms of gentamicin per ml proved  to be highly reliable for detection of hlgr. the structural gene coding for hlgr  was specifically amplified by the polymerase chain reaction in all isolates showing this resistance trait. moreover, the gene was specifically detected by a  nonradioactively labelled oligonucleotide probe in colony blot hybridization assays, indicating the potential application of these molecular approaches as a diagnostic tool.

AB  == forty-eight clinical isolates identified as either enterococcus faecium or enterococcus faecalis with the microscan system (dade international, microscan inc., west sacramento, calif.) were further characterized by two supplementary biochemical tests (pigment production and motility). twenty isolates (42%), all initially identified as e. faecium, were motile. of these 20, 8 isolates (17%) produced yellow pigment and were identified as enterococcus casseliflavus and the remaining 12 (25%) were nonpigmented and were identified as enterococcus gallinarum. identical identification results were obtained when pcr amplification of regions of the vanc gene was used as a technique for differentiating these organisms. the results of this study indicate that motility and pigment production tests together with commercial test systems are sufficient for reliable identifications of e. faecium, e. casseliflavus, and e. gallinarum.

AB  == objective: a clinical, microbiological, and molecular analysis to identify the source of a cluster of pseudoinfections. designs: retrospective analysis of the cases, prospective epidemiologic survey, and laboratory investigation. molecular  analysis of the isolates was performed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). setting: a tertiary veterans affairs medical center. patients: three patients admitted over a 2-week period with musculoskeletal complaints had one or more joint fluid specimens submitted for culture. in each case, anaerobic chopped meat-glucose broth (cmgb) tubes yielded one or more organisms not typically associated with septic arthritis (enterobacter cloacae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia hermannii, and pseudomonas diminuti). the first three organisms were isolated from specimens from multiple patients. two patients had multiple positive cultures; for two patients, separate cultures yielded additional organisms on solid media. results: laboratory investigation yielded an isolate of e faecium from 1 of 30 sham-inoculated cmgb tubes. pfge analysis demonstrated that a single strain of e  cloacae was isolated from four cmgb tubes representing all three patients, and a  single strain of e faecium was isolated from cmgb tubes representing two patients and the sham-inoculated tube. conclusions: the application of molecular typing clearly demonstrated clonality among the isolates and indicated that a common source of contamination, most likely the cmgb tubes, was responsible for these cases.

TI  == high-level gentamicin resistance among enterococci.
AB  == the bi-functional enzyme 6'-aminoglycoside acetyltransferase (aac-6')-2" aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (aph-2"), which is encoded by the 2 kb fused gene aaca-aphd, mediates gentamicin resistance in enterococcus faecalis. this gene is associated with the composite transposon tn5281 that shares extensive homology with transposons tn4001 and tn4031 found in staphylococci. typically these transposons are characterized by the resistance gene being flanked by 1.35  kb insertion sequences (is256). the resistance gene (aaca-aphd) appears identical among all e. faecalis studied, but restriction enzyme analysis indicates notable  heterogeneity within the flanking regions. various combinations of is256-like and is257-like elements, or portions thereof, have been described in different resistant isolates. as gentamicin resistance has been described in other enterococcal species (e. faecium, e. avium, e. gallinarum, e. raffinosus, e. casseliflavus) homology with the resistance gene of e. faecalis has largely been  maintained, but more extensive variations in the flanking sequences have been noted. although many similarities exist among enterococcal gentamicin resistance  determinants, heterogeneity in the flanking regions indicates that measurable divergence exists among these determinants. this divergence may be of value in characterizing the mechanisms and natural course of gentamicin resistance dissemination which now includes staphylococci, enterococci and streptococci.

TI  == detection of glycopeptide resistance genotypes and identification to the species  level of clinically relevant enterococci by pcr.
AB  == a pcr assay that allows simultaneous detection of glycopeptide resistance genotypes and identification to the species level of clinically relevant enterococci (enterococcus faecium, e. faecalis, e. gallinarum, and e. casseliflavus) was developed. this assay was based on specific amplification of internal fragments of genes encoding d-alanine:d-alanine ligases and related glycopeptide resistance proteins. the specificity of the assay was tested on 5 well-characterized glycopeptide-resistant strains and on 15 susceptible enterococcal type strains. clinical isolates of enterococci that could not be identified to the species level by conventional methods were identified by the pcr test. this assay offers a specific and rapid alternative to antibiotic susceptibility tests, in particular for detection of low-level vancomycin resistance.

TI  == dna hybridization and contour-clamped homogeneous electric field electrophoresis  for identification of enterococci to the species level.
AB  == in this study, 113 enterococcus faecium, 37 enterococcus faecalis, 24 enterococcus gallinarum, 15 enterococcus raffinosus, and 13 enterococcus casseliflavus clinical isolates and american type culture collection (atcc) strains were evaluated by contour-clamped homogeneous electric field electrophoresis. thirty-one of the e. faecium, 22 of the e. faecalis, 24 of the e. gallinarum, 15 of the e. raffinosus, and 13 of the e. casseliflavus isolates were also evaluated by dna-dna hybridization. genomic dnas from type strains e. faecalis atcc 19433, e. faecium atcc 19434, e. gallinarum atcc 49573, e. raffinosus atcc 49427, and e. casseliflavus atcc 25788 were labeled with biotin for use as probes. e. faecalis differed from all other species in always having a largest fragment of > 400 kb. e. gallinarum was different from all other species  in having all smai fragments of < 200 kb. biotin-labeled probes showed a high degree of hybridization with genomic dna from the same species and a low degree of hybridization when hybridized to genomic dna from different species for all isolates tested except for four isolates identified as e. faecium by conventional biochemical methods. the dna from these four isolates hybridized strongly to dna  from e. gallinarum atcc 49573 and weakly to e. faecium atcc 19434 dna and had all smai fragments of < 200 kb in size. these data suggest that these isolates are nonmotile e. gallinarum. dna from each atcc type strain hybridized strongly with  itself and had only a low degree of hybridization with dna from other atcc type strains tested. these results suggest that contour-clamped homogeneous electric field electrophoresis patterns and dna-dna hybridization with biotin-labeled probes may be of use for species differentiation of some enterococci.

TI  == resistance of enterococcus faecium to neutrophil-mediated phagocytosis.
AB  == during a previous study of the opsonic requirements for neutrophil (polymorphonuclear leukocyte [pmn])-mediated killing of enterococci, we identified two strains of enterococcus faecium (tx0015 and tx0016) that were resistant to pmn-mediated killing. to better define the mechanism of this resistance, we examined phagocytosis with a fluorescence assay and found that tx0016 was completely resistant to phagocytosis by pmns; this finding was confirmed by electron microscopy. examination of multiple strains of enterococci  revealed that all 20 strains of enterococcus faecalis tested were readily phagocytosed (mean, 18 intracellular organisms per pmn; range, 7 to 28). in contrast, only 13 (50%) of 26 strains of e. faecium tested were susceptible to phagocytosis (> or = 7 organisms per pmn); the other 13 strains showed < or = 3 organisms per pmn. enterococcus casseliflavus atcc 25788 and one strain of enterococcus hirae were also resistant to phagocytosis, while two strains of enterococcus durans, enterococcus mundtii atcc 43186, and one strain each of enterococcus raffinosus and enterococcus solitarius were readily phagocytosed. exposure of e. faecium tx0016 to sodium periodate, but not to the protease trypsin or pronase or to phospholipase c, eliminated resistance to phagocytosis.  sialic acid, a common periodate-sensitive structure used by microorganisms to resist opsonization, could not be demonstrated in e. faecium tx0016 by the thiobarbituric acid method, nor was phagocytosis of tx0016 altered by neuraminidase treatment. this study suggests that there is a difference in susceptibility to phagocytosis by pmns between different species of enterococci and that a carbohydrate-containing moiety which is not sialic acid may be involved in the resistance of e. faecium tx0016 to phagocytosis.

AB  == we examined 105 clinical isolates of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci collected from 31 u.s. hospitals in 14 states during may 1988 to july 1992. the isolates included 82 enterococcus faecium, 8 e. faecalis, 6 enterococcus spp., 5 e. gallinarum, 3 e. casseliflavus, and 1 e. raffinosus. the isolates were categorized into the following four phenotypes of glycopeptide resistance on the  basis of their mic patterns: (i) 70 vana (vancomycin [vm] mic, > or = 64 micrograms/ml; teicoplanin [tei] mic, 16 to > or = 128 micrograms/ml), (ii) 26 vanb (vm mic, 16 to 1,024 micrograms/ml; tei mic, < or = 2 micrograms/ml), (iii)  5 vanc (vm mic, 4 to 16 micrograms/ml; tei mic, < or = 2 micrograms/ml) in e. gallinarum, and (iv) 3 e. casseliflavus and 1 e. raffinosus isolates for which vm mics were 4 to 16 micrograms/ml and tei mics were < or = 1 micrograms/ml were called unclassified. of the 101 isolates with the vana, vanb, and vanc phenotypes, 99 were confirmed by production of a specific 1,030-, 433-, or 796-bp polymerase chain reaction product, respectively, and hybridization with the respective gene probe. the vana gene was also detected in the e. raffinosus isolate for which the vm mic was 16 micrograms/ml and the tei mic was 1 microgram/ml. the vana gene was located on either a 34- or a 60-kb plasmid in all of the u.s. isolates examined. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis demonstrated both intrahospital and interhospital diversity among vmr enterococci in the united states and was more useful than plasmid analysis for epidemiologic studies.

TI  == presumptive fecal streptococci in environmental samples characterized by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  == the use of fecal streptococci as fecal indicators requires better knowledge of the ecology of these bacteria. we isolated 371 presumptive fecal streptococci from environmental samples--domestic wastewater, forest industry wastewater, contaminated surface and seawater, well water, cow dung, bird droppings, and pristine waters--and clustered them according to their protein profiles in one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. some clusters could be tentatively identified with the help of reference strains. samples from each environment had a typical composition of streptococcus types. enterococcus faecalis was present, but not as a dominating enterococcal species, in samples in which fecal contamination was probable. enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus hirae, and enterococcus mundtii had protein profiles that were difficult to distinguish from each other.  these bacteria were found in a variety of samples. enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum had identical protein profiles. on the basis of the maximum temperatures for growth and pigment production, isolates of this protein  profile group common in forest industry wastewaters were identified as e. casseliflavus. lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis was also found in this environment. nearly all strains from pristine waters belonged to protein profile  groups which could not be identified with the aid of known aerococcus, enterococcus, lactococcus, or streptococcus strains. the maximum temperatures for growth and the results of fatty acid analysis were in general agreement within each protein profile group.

TI  == the vanb gene confers various levels of self-transferable resistance to vancomycin in enterococci.
AB  == thirty-nine strains of enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis resistant to vancomycin and susceptible to teicoplanin on disk susceptibility testing (phenotypic class b) were isolated in 15 hospitals in europe and the united states. the mics of vancomycin for these strains ranged from 4 to 1024 micrograms/ml. part of the vancomycin resistance gene vanb from e. faecalis v583  hybridized with a single but variably sized hindiii-kpni fragment of total dna from all 39 strains. this indicates that a single class of resistance determinants accounts for the vanb phenotype. no hybridization was detected with  dna from intrinsically resistant enterococcus gallinarum or enterococcus casseliflavus. hybridization with dna from enterococcal strains susceptible to or with acquired resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin was not observed. the genes conferring resistance to vancomycin were self-transferable to other enterococcus strains in 14 of the 39 strains. it thus appears that vanb confers various levels of conjugative vancomycin resistance in enterococci.

AB  == since 1988, when the first vancomycin-resistant enterococcus was described, several descriptions of failures of disk diffusion breakpoints to detect low-level vancomycin resistance (mics, 8 to 32 micrograms/ml) have been published. a four-laboratory collaborative study was undertaken to establish more accurate breakpoints for the disk test. mueller-hinton agar was used to perform dilution testing (in three laboratories) and disk diffusion testing (in all laboratories). results were determined at 18, 24, and 48 h, and zones of inhibition were read using both transmitted and reflected light. one hundred organisms (35 enterococcus faecalis, 55 e. faecium, and 10 e. gallinarum or e. casseliflavus isolates) were selected to represent vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant phenotypes. interlaboratory agreement of agar dilution mics was better at 24 h (91 to 94% within +/- 1 dilution) than at 18 h (76% within +/- 1 dilution). therefore, 24-h agar dilution mic results were used as the reference.  for disk diffusion, it was critical to note the presence of a haze or colonies inside the zone when interpreting the test, since this correlated better with the results of the agar dilution test. the presence of a haze or inner colonies was best detected by reading the zones with transmitted light and incubating the plates for a full 24 h. when plotted against 24-h agar dilution mics, breakpoints of </= 14 mm (resistant), 15 to 16 mm (intermediate), and >/= 17 mm (susceptible) resulted in 58 minor errors (14.5% of total values) and 5 very major errors (2.2% of resistant values or 1.3% of total values). no major errors were seen. results  of repeat testing using a common lot of mueller-hinton agar showed 52 minor errors (13.3%) and 4 major errors (4.2% of susceptible values of 1.0% pf total values) but no very major errors. it is recommended that any haze or colonies within the zone be taken into account when determining zones of inhibition and that an mic test be performed for strains with intermediate zones if vancomycin is being considered for treatment.

TI  == detection of high-level aminoglycoside resistance in enterococci other than enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == the ability of six screening methods to detect high-level aminoglycoside resistance in enterococcal species other than enterococcus faecalis was investigated. the 85 enterococcus isolates, which included 55 e. faecium, 11 e. gallinarum, 9 e. casseliflavus, 5 e. raffinosus, 4 e. avium, and 1 e. mundtii, were tested by using aminoglycoside-supplemented brain heart infusion agar (bhi), remel ef synergy quad plates, high-content aminoglycoside diffusion disks, standard (prepared in-house) microdilution panels, pasco mic gram positive microdilution panels, and vitek gps-ta cards. when tested on bhi, 32 and 35 strains showed resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin, respectively. resistance profiles obtained with remel ef synergy quad plates were in complete agreement with those obtained on bhi. however, growth on mueller-hinton agar-based plates was not as heavy. some isolates showed only weak growth and required 48 h for resistance to become evident, especially with swab inoculation  of quadrants containing 2,000 micrograms of gentamicin per ml. profiles obtained  by use of the agar-based screens were used as the basis for evaluating the other  methods. disk diffusion showed complete agreement. no false resistance occurred by either microdilution method, but 48 h of incubation was needed for detection of some gentamicin-resistant isolates, and 14% of the streptomycin-resistant strains were not detected by standard microdilution. the vitek gps-ta card detected 81 and 100% of the gentamicin- and streptomycin-resistant isolates, respectively. in general, most methods used to detect high-level aminoglycoside resistance in e. faecalis appear to be reliable for the testing of the other enterococcal species. however, further investigations with a greater number of resistant e. raffinosus, e. avium, and e. mundtii isolates, when they are available, will be useful for establishing the full range of enterococci that can reliably be tested by the various methods.

TI  == recovery of vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci from pediatric liver transplant recipients.
AB  == between november 1988 and october 1989, 49 first-time pediatric liver transplant  recipients at the children's hospital of pittsburgh were prospectively monitored  for the presence of stool colonization and the development of disease caused by vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci (vrgpc). quantitative stool culturing was done on a weekly basis, and cultures were planted onto a selective medium for vrgpc. isolates for which the mic was greater than or equal to 8 were considered  resistant to vancomycin. patients were monitored clinically for the development of infection, and their charts were systematically reviewed for the use of antibiotics. eighty-six isolates were recovered from 36 of the 49 patients. enterococcal species were isolated from 31 patients and included enterococcus gallinarum (n = 28), e. casseliflavus (n = 14), e. faecium (n = 9), e. faecalis (n = 2), e. mundtii (n = 2), and e. durans (n = 1). stool colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci was noted to increase steadily during the first  month after transplantation. only 9 of 31 patients demonstrated clearance of these organisms in serial repeat cultures. additional isolates of vrgpc included  lactobacillus confusus (n = 13), lactobacillus spp. (n = 12), and pediococcus pentosaceus (n = 4). infection due to vrgpc developed in three patients: a urinary tract infection in two and peritonitis in one. e. faecium was the pathogen in each of these cases. the ranges of mics of vancomycin were 8 to 32 micrograms/ml for all enterococcal isolates and greater than 128 micrograms/ml for lactobacillus and pediococcus isolates. all lactobacillus and pediococcus isolates were resistant to teicoplanin, although they were susceptible to daptomycin. all other isolates were susceptible to both teicoplanin and daptomycin. this study demonstrates that stool colonization with vrgpc may be a common and early finding among pediatric liver transplant recipients. however, infection appears to be uncommon.

AB  == isolates of group d streptococci from above and below a sewer outfall and a series of clinical isolates have been speciated to sub-species level. from below  the sewer outfall, streptococcus faecalis var. faecalis predominates whereas above the outfall, s. faecium var. casseliflavus predominates. s. faecalis var. faecalis, s. faecalis var. liquefaciens and s. faecalis var. zymogenes were the predominant sub-species in the clinical isolates where s. faecium var. casseliflavus was virtually absent. s. faecalis var. liquefaciens and s. faecalis var. zymogenes were uncommon in the environmental isolates. s. faecium and s. durans were more abundant in the environmental than in the clinical isolates. the use of group d streptococci as indicators of faecal pollution would seem more suited to higher, rather than lower, levels of pollution. a statistically significant increase in resistance to antibiotics (ampicillin, penicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline) was seen in isolates from below the outfall compared with those from above and a further significant increase was seen in the clinical isolates compared with the former. resistance to tetracycline was most common and ampicillin was the only antibiotic tested to  which no resistance was detected. multiple antibiotic resistance was rare in the  environmental isolates. even in moderately polluted water, there is not a large pool of antibiotic resistance.

TI  == taxonomic studies on some group d streptococci.
AB  == biochemical, menaquinone, fatty acid and dna analyses were conducted on a number  of streptococci of serological group d. the results indicate that s. faecalis, s. faeclum, s. casseliflavus and taxa previously designated 's. avium', 's. durans'  and "s. faecalis var. malodoratus' are distinct species. strains previously labelled 's. faecium var. mobilis' were shown to be identical with s. casseliflavus. the results also indicate that some group d streptococci recently  isolated from chickens constitute a new species.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of streptococcus.
AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. the major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (s. faecalis, s. faecium, 's. avium' and a proposed new species 's. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (s. bovis, s. equinus, s. salivarius, 's. casseliflavus', s. mutans, s. raffinolactis and an unidentified oral group i); (c) lactic species group (s. lactis including s. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (s. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (s. mitis, s. sanguis, a proposed new species 's. oralis' and 's. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. equi, 's. equisimilis' including 's. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of lancefield group b strains of human origin);  (g) parapyogenic species group (s. uberis, 's. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of lancefield groups r, s and t). species of aerococcus, gemella, leuconostoc and pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.

TI  == the distribution of isoprenoid quinones in streptococci of serological groups d and n.
AB  == the isoprenoid quinone contents of streptococci of serological groups d and n were investigated. streptococcus faecalis, s. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens and s. faecalis subsp. zymogenes strains contained demethylmenaquinones with nine isoprene units as their major isoprenologues. menaquinones with eight isoprene units predominated in s. faecium subsp. casseliflavus and s. faecium subsp. mobilis whereas menaquinones with nine isoprene units constituted the major components in strains of s. cremoris, s. cremoris subsp. alactosus, s. lactis and s. lactis subsp. diacetylactis. strains of s. avium, s. bovis, s. durans, s. equinus, s. faecium, s. raffinolactis and s. suis contained neither menaquinones  nor ubiquinones. the isoprenoid quinone data correlate well with other kinds of data on these organisms and are of value in the classification of these bacteria.

TI  == distribution of group d streptococci in rivers and streams.
AB  == a study was undertaken to determine sources of bacteriological contamination of rivers as well as the ecology of faecal streptococci in natural and contaminated  waters. media used to characterize and speciate group d streptococci were also evaluated using isolates from the water and sediment. due to the low concentrations of faecal coliforms (fc) and faecal streptococci (fs) in river water samples, the fc/fs ratio was shown to be of little value in determining sources of contamination. high concentrations of fc and fs from sediment samples  gave more credible fc/fs ratios. the actual distribution of group d streptococcal species in rivers and streams was also shown. high concentrations of all division ii species (s. faecium, s. faecium var. casseliflavus, and s. faecium var. durans) were found in the water and sediment samples, with s. faecium var. durans comprising 50% of the total number of isolates. low concentrations of division i  group d streptococci (s. faecalis and varieties) were found, while only one isolation of division iii group d streptococci (s. bovis and s. equinus) was made.

TI  == differentiation of some enterococci by gas chromatography.
AB  == relative fatty acid compositions of 37 enterococci were examined by gas chromatography. streptococcus faecalis, s. faecium, and s. faecium var. durans yielded similar fatty acid patterns. strains of s. faecium var. casseliflavus, and a motile yellow-pigmented streptococcus, contained very low levels of c(19:0) cyclopropane fatty acid and four unidentified components, compared to the other strains of enterococci examined. there were no significant differences in the fatty acid patterns of enterococci grouped according to plant, animal, or human source.

TI  == enterococci in insects.
AB  == enterococci were obtained from 213 of 403 insects cultured during a 14-month period, in numbers from 10(3) to 3 x 10(7)/g of insect. insects were taken only from nonurban, wild, and cultivated fields and woods. in species of insects carrying them, enterococci were not always present in every individual cultured,  and often more than one species of enterococcus occurred within a species. enterococci were obtained from certain insects taken in the field during the dormant season, suggesting their role as overwintering agents. they were generally present in species feeding on nectar, succulent plant parts, and on and ir forest litter, but not from insects feeding on less succulent leaves and stems. streptococcus faecalis was recovered from 32%, streptococcus faecium from  22.4%, and streptococcus faecium var. casseliflavus from 43.5% of members of the  37 taxa of insects. s. faecalis and s. faecium var. casseliflavus exhibit a high  percent of conformity to the properties published for them. the heterogeneity in  properties of s. faecium is similar to that found for the species taken from plants. many fail to grow in broth at 45 c or in broth containing 6.5% nacl; 50%  of the cultures ferment both melezitose and melibiose, and a few ferment neither  sugar. the remainder ferment melibiose only. failure to reduce methylene blue in  milk by s. faecalis and s. faecium is correlated with the inability to ferment lactose. more than 93% of the cultures of s. faecalis digest casein in milk from  the top downward, following the production of a soft, flowing curd. because this  property is not characteristic of s. faecalis taken from humans, the reaction in  litmus milk is suggested as a means of differentiation between cultures of remote and innocent origin in nature and recent, human pollution.
