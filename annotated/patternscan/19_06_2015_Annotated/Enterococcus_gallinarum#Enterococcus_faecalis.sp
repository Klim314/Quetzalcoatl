TI  == effect of in-feed administration and withdrawal of tylosin phosphate on antibiotic resistance in enterococci isolated from feedlot steers.
AB  == tylosin phosphate is a macrolide commonly administered to cattle in north america for the control of liver abscesses. this study investigated the effect of in-feed administration of tylosin phosphate to cattle at subtherapeutic levels and its subsequent withdrawal on macrolide resistance using enterococci as an indicator bacterium. fecal samples were collected from steers that received no antibiotics  and steers administered tylosin phosphate (11 ppm) in-feed for 197 days and withdrawn 28 days before slaughter. enterococcus species isolated from fecal samples were identified through sequencing the groes-el intergenic spacer region  and subject to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, identification of resistance determinants and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiling. tylosin increased (p < 0.05) the proportion of ery(r) and tyl(r) enterococci within the population. just prior to its removal, the proportion of ery(r) and tyl(r) resistant enterococci began decreasing and continued to decrease after tylosin was withdrawn from the diet until there was no difference (p > 0.05) between treatments on d 225. this suggests that antibiotic withdrawal prior to slaughter  contributes to a reduction in the proportion of macrolide resistant enterococci entering the food chain. among the 504 enterococci isolates characterized, enterococcus hirae was found to predominate (n = 431), followed by enterococcus villorum (n = 32), enterococcus faecium (n = 21), enterococcus durans (n = 7), enterococcus casseliflavus (n = 4), enterococcus mundtii (n = 4), enterococcus gallinarum (n = 3), enterococcus faecalis (n = 1), and enterococcus thailandicus  (n = 1). the diversity of enterococci was greater in steers at arrival than at exit from the feedlot. erythromycin resistant isolates harbored the erm(b) and/or msrc gene. similar pfge profiles of ery(r) e. hirae pre- and post-antibiotic treatment suggest that increased abundance of ery(r) enterococci after administration of tylosin phosphate reflects selection for strains that were already present within the gastrointestinal tract of cattle at arrival.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance profile of enterococcus species isolated from intestinal tracts of hospitalized patients in jimma, ethiopia.
AB  == background: multi-drug-resistant enterococci colonizing the intestinal tract of hospitalized patients are the major source of infection as well as nosocomial spread. despite worldwide increasing rate of multidrug resistant enterococci colonization and infection among hospitalized patients, there is scarcity of data from resource limited setting. the present study aimed at determining the antimicrobial resistance profile of enterococcus species from intestinal tracts of hospitalized patients in jimma, ethiopia. methods: the study was conducted among hospitalized patients at jimma university specialized hospital, from january to july 2013. fecal samples were collected and processed for bacterial isolation and susceptibility testing to antimicrobial agents. stool samples were  inoculated onto enterococcus selective media (bile esculin azide agar plate) with and without 6 microg/ml of vancomycin. the isolates were identified to genus and  species level by cultural characteristics, gram's stain, catalase test, growth in 6.5% nacl broth, growth at 45 degrees c, motility test and by using api 20 streptococcus system. sensitivity testing was done using kirby-bauer disk diffusion method. minimum inhibitory concentrations for vancomycin were determined using e-test strips. result: overall, enterococci were isolated from 114 (76%) of the study subjects. the isolates were enterococcus faecium (35.1%) followed by enterococcus faecalis (29.8%), enterococcus gallinarum (17.5%), enterococcus casseliflavus (8.8%) and enterococcus durans (8.8%). among 114 tested enterococci isolates, 41 (36%) were resistant to ampicillin, 62 (54.4%) to streptomycin and 39 (34.2%) to gentamycin. other alternative antibiotics to treat mixed nosocomial infection caused by enterococci also showed high rate of resistance in vitro: ciprofloxacin (50% of resistance), norfloxacin (49.1%), erythromycin (63.2%), tetracycline (64.9%), chloramphenicol (34.2%), and nitrofrantoin (32.4%). multiple drug resistance was observed among 89.5% of e. faecium and e. faecalis. vancomycin resistant enterococci were observed in 5% of  e. faecium isolates. conclusion: this study reveals high rate of fecal colonization by multidrug-resistant enterococci and prevalence of vancomycin resistance strains. thus periodic surveillance of antibacterial susceptibilities  is recommended to detect emerging resistance and to prevent the spread of antibacterial-resistant strains.

TI  == diversity of enterococcal species and characterization of high-level aminoglycoside resistant enterococci of samples of wastewater and surface water in tunisia.
AB  == one hundred-fourteen samples of wastewater (n=64) and surface-water (n=50) were inoculated in slanetz-bartley agar plates supplemented or not with gentamicin (sb-gen and sb plates, respectively) for enterococci recovery. enterococci were obtained from 75% of tested samples in sb media (72% in wastewater; 78% in surface-water), and 85 enterococcal isolates (one/positive-sample) were obtained. enterococcus faecium was the most prevalent species (63.5%), followed by enterococcus faecalis (20%), enterococcus hirae (9.4%), enterococcus casseliflavus (4.7%), and enterococcus gallinarum/enterococcus durans (2.4%). antibiotic resistance detected among these enterococci was as follows [percentage/detected gene (number isolates)]: kanamycin [29%/aph(3')-iiia (n=22)], streptomycin [8%/ant(6)-ia (n=4)], erythromycin [44%/erm(b) (n=34)], tetracycline [18%/tet(m) (n=6)/tet(m)-tet(l) (n=9)], chloramphenicol [2%/cat(a) (n=1)], ciprofloxacin [7%] and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [94%]. high-level-gentamicin resistant (hlr-g) enterococci were recovered from 15 samples in sb-gen or sb plates [12/64 samples of wastewater (19%) and 3/50 samples of surface-water (6%)]; hlr-g isolates were identified as e. faecium (n=7), e. faecalis (n=6), and e. casseliflavus (n=2). these hlr-g enterococci carried the aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia and erm(b) genes, in addition to aph(3')-iiia  (n=10), ant(6)-ia (n=9), tet(m) (n=13), tet(l) (n=8) and cat(a) genes (n=2). three hlr-g enterococci carried the esp virulence gene. sequence-types detected among hlr-g enterococci were as follows: e. faecalis (st480, st314, st202, st55,  and the new ones st531 and st532) and e. faecium (st327, st12, st296, and the new ones st985 and st986). thirty-two different pfge patterns were detected among 36  high-level-aminoglycoside-resistant enterococci recovered in water samples. diverse genetic lineages of hlr-g enterococci were detected in wastewater and surface-water in tunisia. water can represent an important source for the dissemination of these antibiotic resistant microorganisms to other environments.

TI  == characterization of an enterococcus gallinarum carrying dual vana and vanb cassette.
AB  == the ability of vancomycin resistance determinants to be horizontally transferred  within enterococci species is a concern. identification and characterization of vancomycin resistant enterococci (vre) in a clinical isolate has a significant impact on infection control practices. in this study, we describe a clinical isolate of e. gallinarum exhibiting high level resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin. genetic characterization of this isolate showed the presence of vana and vanb genes in addition to naturally carrying vanc gene. vana was identified on pa6981, a 35,608-bp circular plasmid with significant homology to plasmid ps177. vanb operon was integrated into the bacterial chromosome and showed high level of homology to previously reported tn1549 and tn5382. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of e. gallinarum carrying both vana and vanb  operons, indicating the importance of identifying vancomycin resistance mechanism in non- e. faecium and -e. faecalis enterococcal species.

TI  == detection of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis st6-vanb2 and e. faecium  st915-vana in faecal samples of wild rattus rattus in spain.
AB  == the detection of vancomycin-resistant-enterococci (vre) among wild animals represents a worrisome public health concern. the objectives of the study were to determine the possible presence of vre in faecal samples of wild small mammals in spain, to characterize the vancomycin resistance mechanisms and genetic lineages  of recovered isolates and to know the diversity of enterococcal species in these  animals. a total of 155 faecal samples from small mammals were inoculated in slanetz-bartley agar supplemented or not with vancomycin (van-sb/sb plates). the  antimicrobial susceptibility profile to 12 antimicrobials and the presence of 20  antimicrobial resistance genes was analyzed. the structure of tn1546 and the presence of gele, cyla, asa, esp and hyl genes was studied. multilocus-sequence-typing (mlst) technique was also performed. vre isolates were recovered in van-sb plates in 11 samples. two samples contained vanb2-positive e. faecalis isolates of lineage st6, which showed a multiresistance phenotype and harboured the virulence genes gele and asa. one sample contained a vancomycin-resistant e. faecium isolate of the new lineage st915, with the vana gene included into tn1546 (truncated with is1542 and is1216 elements). the vanb2  and vana isolates were obtained from rattus rattus. the remaining eight vre-positive samples contained species with intrinsic vancomycin-resistance mechanisms: e. casseliflavus (n=5) and e. gallinarum (n=3). one hundred and forty-seven vancomycin-susceptible-enterococcal isolates were obtained in sb plates, and e. faecalis and e. faecium were the most frequent detected species. this is the first report of vanb2-containing enterococci in wild animals.

TI  == modified 16s-23s rrna intergenic region restriction endonuclease analysis for species identification of enterococcus strains isolated from pigs, compared with  identification using classical methods and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == fast and reliable identification of bacteria to at least the species level is currently the basis for correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment of infections. this is particularly important in the case of bacteria of the genus enterococcus, whose resistance profile is often correlated with their species (e.g. resistance to vancomycin). in this study, we evaluated restriction endonuclease analysis of the 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic transcribed spacer (its) region for species identification of enterococcus. the utility of the method was compared with that of phenotypic methods [biochemical profile evaluation and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms)]. identification was based on 21 enterococcus reference strains, of the species e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. hirae, e. durans, e. casseliflavus, e. gallinarum, e. avium, e. cecorum and e. columbae, and 47 enterococcus field strains isolated from pigs. restriction endonuclease analysis  of the its-pcr product using hinfi, rsai and mboi, in the order specified, enabled species differentiation of the enterococcus reference and field strains,  and in the case of the latter, the results of species identification were identical (47/47) to those obtained by maldi-tof ms. moreover, as a result of digestion with mboi, a unique restriction profile was also obtained for the strains (3/3) identified by maldi-tof ms as e. thailandicus. in our opinion, restriction endonuclease analysis of the 16s-23s rrna gene its region of enterococcus may be a simple and relatively fast (less than 4 h) alternative method for identifying the species occurring most frequently in humans and animals.

TI  == identification of enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis as vanc-type vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) from sewage and river water in the provincial city of miyazaki, japan.
AB  == as a first step for assessing the risk to human health posed by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) in the aquatic environment, we screened sewage and urban river water samples from miyazaki, japan for vre. because vancomycin-resistant organisms are not as prevalent in sewage and river water as  vancomycin-susceptible organisms, the samples were screened by minimum inhibitory concentration test using the vancomycin-supplemented membrane-enterococcus indoxyl-beta-d-glucoside (mei) agar. the isolates, presumed to be enterococci, were identified using 16s rrna sequencing analysis. the percentages of vre isolates screened using 4 mug ml(-1) vancomycin-supplemented mei agar from sewage and urban river water samples were 12% and 24%, respectively. the vancomycin-resistant genes vanc1 and vanc2/3 were detected in the isolates from both samples by pcr analysis. all enterococci isolates containing vanc1, which is a specific gene for vanc-type of vre, were identified as enterococcus casseliflavus/gallinarum. further, 92% enterococci isolates containing vanc2/3 were identified as e. casseliflavus/gallinarum, the remaining isolates containing vanc2/3 were e. faecium (4%) and e. faecalis (4%). thereafter, the distribution of e. faecium and e. faecalis, which are the major types of enterococci in humans containing vanc2/3, was observed in the water samples collected.

TI  == the first report of the vanc(1) gene in enterococcus faecium isolated from a human clinical specimen.
AB  == the vanc(1) gene, which is chromosomally located, confers resistance to vancomycin and serves as a species marker for enterococcus gallinarum. enterococcus faecium tj4031 was isolated from a blood culture and harbours the vanc(1)gene. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays were performed to detect vanxyc and vantc genes. only the vanxyc gene was found in the e. faecium tj4031 isolate. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of vancomycin and teicoplanin were 2 microg/ml and 1 microg/ml, respectively. real-time reverse transcription-pcr results revealed that the vanc(1) and vanxyc genes were not expressed. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and southern hybridisation results showed that the vanc(1) gene was encoded in the chromosome. e. faecalis isolated from animals has been reported to harbour vanc(1)gene. however, this study is the first to report the presence of the vanc(1)gene in e. faecium of human origin. additionally, our research showed the vanc(1)gene cannot serve as a species-specific gene of e. gallinarum and that it is able to be transferred between bacteria. although the resistance marker is not expressed in the strain,  our results showed that e. faecium could acquire the vanc(1)gene from different species.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococcal species isolated from antibiotic-treated dogs and cats.
AB  == in this study, we examined the antimicrobial susceptibility of the enterococci isolated from dogs and cats in japan during 2011-2012. fecal samples were collected from 84 dogs and 16 cats that underwent antibiotic treatment. enterococci were detected in 70 of 84 dogs (83.3%) and 7 of 16 cats (43.8%). the  most prevalent enterococcus species was enterococcus faecalis (64.9%); enterococcus faecium and enterococcus durans were also isolated from 14 of 77 (18.2%) and 5 of 77 (6.5%) of these animals, respectively. the most active resistance was observed for erythromycin (44.2%) and oxytetracycline (44.2%), and there was considerable resistance to lincomycin (41.6%), gentamicin (31.2%) and kanamycin (31.2%). compared with the results of a similar study conducted in 2006 and 2007, enterococci susceptibility to enrofloxacin and ampicillin had significantly increased. enterococcus gallinarum harboring vanc1 and enterococcus casseliflavus harboring vanc2/3 were isolated from 4 of 77 enterococcal isolates. however, no enterococcal isolates were resistant to vancomycin. multidrug resistance was found for as few as two and as many as nine antimicrobials regardless of the class. these results demonstrate that dogs and cats treated with antibiotics are commonly colonized with antimicrobial-resistant enterococci.

TI  == high level aminoglycoside resistance and distribution of aminoglycoside resistant genes among clinical isolates of enterococcus species in chennai, india.
AB  == enterococci are nosocomial pathogen with multiple-drug resistance by intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. aminoglycosides along with cell wall inhibitors are given clinically for treating enterococcal infections. 178 enterococcal isolates  were analyzed in this study. e. faecalis is identified to be the predominant enterococcus species, along with e. faecium, e. avium, e. hirae, e. durans, e. dispar and e. gallinarum. high level aminoglycoside resistance (hlar) by mic for  gentamicin (gm), streptomycin (sm) and both (gm + sm) antibiotics was found to be 42.7%, 29.8%, and 21.9%, respectively. detection of aminoglycoside modifying enzyme encoding genes (ame) in enterococci was identified by multiplex pcr for aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia; aph(2'')-ib; aph(2'')-ic; aph(2'')-id and aph(3')-iiia genes. 38.2% isolates carried aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia gene and 40.4% isolates carried aph(3')-iiia gene. aph(2'')-ib; aph(2'')-ic; aph(2'')-id were not detected among our study isolates. aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia and aph(3')-iiia genes  were also observed in hlar e. durans, e. avium, e. hirae, and e. gallinarum isolates. this indicates that high level aminoglycoside resistance genes are widely disseminated among isolates of enterococci from chennai.

TI  == enterococcal disease, epidemiology, and implications for treatment
AB  == during the past few decades, enterococci have emerged as important healthcare-associated pathogens (arias & murray, 2012; austin, bonten, weinstein, slaughter, & anderson, 1999; boyce, et al., 1994; benenson, et al., 2009; goossens, 1998; handwerger, et al., 1993). the continuing progress of modern medical care toward more intensive and invasive medical therapies for human disease has undoubtedly contributed to the increased prevalence of these remarkable opportunistic pathogens. this trend has also been attributed to the increasing antibiotic resistance among clinical isolates of enterococci. the rapid spread of enterococci with resistance to vancomycin (vre) has been of particular concern. many healthcare-associated strains that are resistant to vancomycin also show resistance to penicillin, as well as high-level resistance (hlr) to aminoglycosides. finally, as has historically been the case with enterococci, resistance is emerging to newer agents used to treat vre infections, such as linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, and daptomycin (chow, donahedian, & zervos, 1997; herrero, issa, & patel, 2002; sabol, patterson, lewis ii, aaron, cadena, & jorgensen, 2005). over the past two decades, enterococcus faecium has emerged as a leading cause of multidrug-resistant enterococcal infection in the united states (hidron, et al., 2008). e. faecium is intrinsically more antibiotic-resistant than e. faecalis, with more than half of its pathogenic isolates expressing resistance to vancomycin, ampicillin, and high-levels of aminoglycosides. treating infections caused by this species can be difficult, and the magnitude of the problem is vast. approximately 40% of medical intensive care units in a recent national healthcare safety network report found that the majority of device-associated infections (namely, infections due to central lines, urinary drainage catheters, and ventilators) were due to vancomycin- and ampicillin-resistant e. faecium (80% and 90.4%, respectively) (hidron, et al., 2008). although they were often resistant to high-level aminoglycosides and some  macrolides, healthcare-associated infections in these units due to e. faecalis remained largely susceptible to vancomycin and ampicillin (93.1% and 96.2%, respectively) for reasons that are not entirely known. other enterococcal species are rarer causes of human infection, including e. durans, e. avium, e. casseliflavus, e. hirae, e. gallinarum, e. raffinosus, and e. muntdii (gordon, et al., 1992). in the following sections, the common human infections caused by enterococci are briefly described. the epidemiology of antibiotic-resistant enterococci in healthcare settings is summarized, including the role of colonization pressure and host factors on the emergence of vre in clinical settings. finally, the current challenges facing clinicians who treat antibiotic-resistant enterococcal infections are reviewed.

TI  == drug-resistant and hospital-associated enterococcus faecium from wastewater, riverine estuary and anthropogenically impacted marine catchment basin.
AB  == background: enterococci, ubiquitous colonizers of humans and other animals, play  an increasingly important role in health-care associated infections (hais). it is believed that the recent evolution of two clinically relevant species, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium occurred in a big part in a hospital environment, leading to formation of high-risk enterococcal clonal complexes (hireccs), which combine multidrug resistance with increased pathogenicity and epidemicity. the aim of this study was to establish the species composition in wastewater, its marine recipient as well as a river estuary and to investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility of collected isolates. molecular methods were additionally applied to test the presence of hirrecc-related e. faecium. results: two wastewater treatment plants (wwtps), their marine outfalls  and vistula river that influence significantly the quality of waters in gulf of gdansk were sampled to investigate the presence of enterococcus spp. four-hundred-twenty-eight isolates were obtained, including e. faecium (244 isolates, 57.0%), e. hirae (113 isolates, 26.4%) and e. faecalis (63 isolates, 14.7%); other species (e. gallinarum/casseliflavus, e. durans and e. avium) accounted for 1.9%. antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed the presence of isolates resistant to erythromycin, tetracycline, amipicillin, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides (high-level resistance), especially among e. faecium, where such isolates were usually characterized by multilocus sequence types associated  with nosocomial lineages 17, 18 and 78 of this species representing hirecc, formerly called cc17. these isolates not only carried several resistance determinants but were also enriched in genes encoding pathogenicity factors (esp, pili) and genes associated with mobile genetic elements (mge), a feature also typical for nosocomial hirecc. conclusions: our data show that wwtps constitute an important source of enterococcal strains carrying antimicrobial resistance determinants, often associated with the presence of mge, for the recipient water  environment, thus increasing a pool of such genes for other organisms. the presence of hireccs in wastewaters and marine/river environment may indicate that adaptations gained in hospitals may be also beneficial for survival of such clones in other settings. there is an obvious need to monitor the release and spread of such strains in order to elucidate better ways to curb their dissemination.

TI  == significance and survival of enterococci during the house fly development.
AB  == house flies are among the most important nonbiting insect pests of medical and veterinary importance. larvae develop in decaying organic substrates and their survival strictly depends on an active microbial community. house flies have been implicated in the ecology and transmission of enterococci, including multi-antibiotic-resistant and virulent strains of enterococcus faecalis. in this study, eight american type culture collection type strains of enterococci including enterococcus avium, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus durans, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcusfaecalis, and enterococcusfaecium were evaluated for their significance in the development of house flies from eggs to adults in bacterial feeding assays. furthermore, the bacterial colonization of the gut of teneral flies as well as the importance of several virulence traits of e. faecalis in larval mortality was assessed. overall survival of house flies (egg to adult) was significantly higher when grown with typically nonpathogenic enterococcal species such as e. hirae (76.0% survival), e. durans (64.0%), and e. avium (64.0%) compared with that with clinically important species e. faecalis (24.0%) and e. faecium (36.0%). however, no significant differences in survival of house fly larvae were detected when grown with e. faecalis strains carrying various virulence traits, including isogenic mutants of the human clinical isolate e. faecalis v583 with in-frame deletions of gelatinase, serine protease, and capsular polysaccharide serotype c. enterococci were commonly detected in fly puparia (range: 75-100%; concentration: 103-105 cfu/puparium);however, the prevalence of enterococci in teneral flies varied greatly: from 25.0 (e. casseliflavus) to 89.5% (e. hirae). in conclusion, depending on the species, enterococci variably support house fly larval development and colonize the gut of teneral adults. the human pathogenic species, e. faecalis and e. faecium, poorly  support larval development and are likely acquired in nature by adult flies during feeding. house fly larvae do not appear to be a suitable model organism for assessment of enterococcal virulence traits.

TI  == incidence of virulence factors in enterococci from raw and fermented meat and biofilm forming capacity at 25 degrees c and 37 degrees c.
AB  == twenty-nine enterococcus strains from raw and fermented meat products were screened for the presence of virulence genes, including those for aggregation substances (asa1 and asa373), cytolysin activator (cyla), collagen binding protein (ace), endocarditis antigen (efaa), enterococcal surface protein (esp) and gelatinase (gele). virulence gene occurrence, expression of gelatinase and pheromone aggregation was greater in enterococcus faecalis than in enterococcus faecium strains. all e. faecalis and 54% of e. faecium were positive for at least one or more virulence gene. the only strain of enterococcus gallinarum tested also contained virulence genes. the effect of different growth temperatures (25 and 37 degrees c) on biofilm formation using polystyrene plates was also assessed. strong biofilm formation occurred at lower than optimum temperature in  all three species of enterococci. neither esp nor gele was necessary for biofilm  formation and this relationship was species rather than strain specific. this study emphasizes the importance of enterococci as a reservoir of virulence genes  and the potential for their genetic transfer to human strains following consumption of uncooked or undercooked contaminated meat.

TI  == genetic characterization of antibiotic resistance and virulence factors in enterococcus spp. from japanese retail ready-to-eat raw fish.
AB  == little information is available on the diversity and distribution of resistance and virulence factors in enterococci isolated from retail fish. in this study, 200 samples of retail ready-to-eat raw fish (sashimi) collected from the japanese prefecture of hiroshima were analyzed for incidence of enterococcus spp. we recovered 96 enterococcal isolates from 90 (45%, 90/200) samples. fifty-six strains were identified at the species level: e. faecalis (n = 31), e. faecium (n = 7), e. casseliflavus (n = 7), e. gallinarum (n = 3), e. phoeniculicola (n = 4), e. raffinosus (n = 2), e. saccharolyticus (n = 1), and e. gilvus (n = 1). twenty-five (26%, 25/96) strains carried antibiotic resistance genes. these included the tet(m), tet(l), tet(k), erm(b), msr(a/b), aph(3'), and blaz genes, which were detected in 12.5%, 9.3%, 2%, 14.5%, 1%, 1%, and 2% of isolates, respectively. the virulence genes gele and asa1 were detected in 31 and 24 e. faecalis strains, respectively. both genes were detected in one e. faecium strain. in conclusion, this is the first study to underscore the importance of sashimi as not only a reservoir of enterococcus spp. carrying resistance and virulence genes, but also a reservoir for unusual enterococcus spp.

TI  == vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) consist mainly of enterococcus faecalis and e faecium, the latter mostly hospital-acquired. in addition, e gallinarum and e casseliflavus are intrinsically vancomycin-resistant and are community-acquired. vre have become common in many hospitals throughout the world and, once established, are very difficult to eradicate. vre are difficult to treat; therefore, infection control measures in hospitals are of prime importance in preventing the establishment of these pathogens. most severe vre infections will need combination therapy because many of the effective antimicrobial agents, when used alone, have only a bacteriostatic effect.

AB  == the increase demand for fresh vegetables is causing an expansion of the market for minimally processed vegetables along with new recognized food safety problems. to gain further insight on this topic we analyzed the microbiological quality of portuguese ready-to-eat salads (rts) and their role in the spread of bacteria carrying acquired antibiotic resistance genes, food products scarcely considered in surveillance studies. a total of 50 rts (7 brands; split or mixed leaves, carrot, corn) were collected in 5 national supermarket chains in porto region (2010). they were tested for aerobic mesophilic counts, coliforms and escherichia coli counts as well as for the presence of salmonella and listeria monocytogenes. samples were also plated in different selective media with/without antibiotics before and after enrichment. the e. coli, other coliforms and enterococcus recovered were characterized for antibiotic resistance profiles and  clonality with phenotypic and genetic approaches. a high number of rts presented  poor microbiological quality (86%--aerobic mesophilic counts, 74%--coliforms, 4%--e. coli), despite the absence of screened pathogens. in addition, a high diversity of bacteria (species and clones) and antibiotic resistance backgrounds  (phenotypes and genotypes) were observed, mostly with enrichment and antibiotic selective media. e. coli was detected in 13 samples (n=78; all types and 4 brands; phylogenetic groups a, b1 and d; none stec) with resistance to tetracycline [72%; tet(a) and/or tet(b)], streptomycin (58%; aada and/or stra-strb), sulfamethoxazole (50%; sul1 and/or sul2), trimethoprim (50%; dfra1 or dfra12), ampicillin (49%; blatem), nalidixic acid (36%), ciprofloxacin (5%) or chloramphenicol (3%; cata). e. coli clones, including the widespread group d/st69, were detected in different samples from the same brand or different brands pointing out to a potential cross-contamination. other clinically relevant resistance genes were detected in 2 raoultella terrigena carrying a bla(shv-2) and 1 citrobacter freundii isolate with a qnrb9 gene. among enterococcus (n=108;  35 samples; enterococcus casseliflavus--40, enterococcus faecalis--20, enterococcus faecium--18, enterococcus hirae--9, enterococcus gallinarum--5, and  enterococcus spp.--16) resistance was detected for tetracyclines [6%; tet(m) and/or tet(l)], erythromycin [3%; erm(b)], nitrofurantoin (1%) or ciprofloxacin (1%). the present study places ready-to-eat salads within the spectrum of ecological niches that may be vehicles for antibiotic resistance bacteria/genes with clinical interest (e.g. e. coli-d-st69; bla(shv-2)) and these findings are worthy of attention as their spread to humans by ingestion cannot be dismissed.

TI  == diversity, distribution and antibiotic resistance of enterococcus spp. recovered  from tomatoes, leaves, water and soil on u.s. mid-atlantic farms.
AB  == antibiotic-resistant enterococci are important opportunistic pathogens and have been recovered from retail tomatoes. however, it is unclear where and how tomatoes are contaminated along the farm-to-fork continuum. specifically, the degree of pre-harvest contamination with enterococci is unknown. we evaluated the prevalence, diversity and antimicrobial susceptibilities of enterococci collected from tomato farms in the mid-atlantic united states. tomatoes, leaves, groundwater, pond water, irrigation ditch water, and soil were sampled and tested for enterococci using standard methods. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was  performed using the sensititre microbroth dilution system. enterococcus faecalis  isolates were characterized using amplified fragment length polymorphism to assess dispersal potential. enterococci (n = 307) occurred in all habitats and colonization of tomatoes was common. seven species were identified: enterococcus  casseliflavus, e. faecalis, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avis, enterococcus hirae and enterococcus raffinosus. e. casseliflavus predominated in soil and on tomatoes and leaves, and e. faecalis predominated in pond water. on plants, distance from the ground influenced presence of enterococci. e. faecalis from samples within a farm were more closely related than those from samples between farms. resistance to rifampicin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin was prevalent. consumption of raw tomatoes as a potential exposure risk for antibiotic-resistant enterococcus spp. deserves further attention.

TI  == detection of vanc1 gene transcription in vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == here we report the presence and expression levels of the vanc1 and vanc(2/3) genes in vancomycin-susceptible strains of enterococcus faecalis. the vanc1 and vanc(2/3) genes were located in the plasmid dna and on the chromosome, respectively. specific mrna of the vanc1 gene was detected in one of these strains. additionally, analysis of the vanc gene sequences showed that these genes are related to the vanc genes of enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus. the presence of vanc genes is useful for the identification of e.  gallinarum and e. casseliflavus. moreover, this is the first report of vanc mrna  in e. faecalis.

TI  == the functional vangcd cluster of clostridium difficile does not confer vancomycin resistance.
AB  == vangcd, a cryptic gene cluster highly homologous to the vang gene cluster of enterococcus faecalis is largely spread in clostridium difficile. since emergence of vancomycin resistance would have dramatic clinical consequences, we have evaluated the capacity of the vangcd cluster to confer resistance. we showed that expression of vangcd is inducible by vancomycin and that vangcd , vanxycd and vantcd are functional, exhibiting d-ala : d-ser ligase, d,d-dipeptidase and d-ser racemase activities respectively. in other bacteria, these enzymes are sufficient to promote vancomycin resistance. trans-complementation of c. difficile with the  vanc resistance operon of enterococcus gallinarum faintly impacted the mic of vancomycin, but did not promote vancomycin resistance in c. difficile. sublethal  concentration of vancomycin led to production of udp-murnac-pentapeptide[d-ser],  suggesting that the vangcd gene cluster is able to modify the peptidoglycan precursors. our results indicated amidation of udp-murnac-tetrapeptide, udp-murnac-pentapeptide[d-ala] and udp-murnac-pentapeptide[d-ser]. this modification is passed on the mature peptidoglycan where a muropeptide tetra-tetra is amidated on the meso-diaminopimelic acid. taken together, our results suggest that the vangcd gene cluster is functional and is prevented from  promoting vancomycin resistance in c. difficile.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of enterococcus species from meat and fermented meat products isolated by a pcr-based rapid screening method.
AB  == enterococci are predominantly found in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals, but species commonly resident on vegetation are known. their presence in large numbers in foods may indicate a lapse in sanitation and their ability to serve as a genetic reservoir of transferable antibiotic resistance is of concern. conventional culture methods for identification of enterococci are slow and sometimes give false results because of the biochemical diversity of the organisms in this genus. this work reports the development of a pcr-based assay to detect enterococci at the genus level by targeting a 16s rrna sequence. published 16s rrna sequences were aligned and used to design genus specific primers (entf and entr). the primers were able to amplify a 678 bp target region  from enterococcus faecalis atcc 7080 and 20 other strains of enterococci from 11  different species, but there was no amplification by 32 species from closely related genera (pediococcus, lactobacillus, streptococcus and listeria) or species of escherichia coli and salmonella. the pcr positive samples were plated, screened by a colony patch technique and their identities were confirmed by api 20 strep panels and sequencing. when dry fermented sausage and ham as well as fresh meat batter for dry cured sausage manufacture were tested for enterococci by the method, 29 enterococcus strains (15 e. faecalis, 13 e. faecium, and one e. gallinarum) were identified. when susceptibility of these enterococci to 12 antibiotics was tested, the highest incidence of resistance was to clindamycin (89.6%), followed by tetracycline hydrochloride (65.5%), tylosin (62%), erythromycin (45%), streptomycin and neomycin (17%), chloramphenicol (10.3%), penicillin (10.3%), ciprofloxacin (10.3%) and gentamicin (3.4%). none was resistant to the clinically important drugs vancomycin or ampicillin. most strains (27/29) were resistant to more than one antibiotic while 17 of 29 strains were resistant to three to 8 antibiotics. the molecular method developed was validated for speciation of enterococci and was useful in assessing uncooked processed meat products as a reservoir for multi-drug resistant enterococcus species.

TI  == the effects of bee pollen extracts on the broiler chicken's gastrointestinal microflora.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bee pollen ethanolic extracts on the in vivo gastrointestinal tract microflora colonization of broiler chickens. a completely randomized experiment based on six treatments (different concentrations of bee pollen - 0, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 45 g kg(-1) diet) was used during 7 weeks. the highest count of faecal enterococci was found in the experimental group with the addition of 15 g of pollen (8.85 +/- 0.87 log cfu g(-1)) per 1 kg of feed mixture. the highest count of lactobacilli was detected in the experimental group with 35 g of pollen per 1 kg of feed mixture and the highest number of the enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in the control group (8.43 +/- 0.15 log cfu g(-1)). moreover, the maldi tof ms biotyper identified the following genera: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella  oxytoca, as well as lactobacillus acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. fermentum and l.  salivarius from the lactobacilli group and enterococcus avium, e. casseliflavus,  e. cecorum, e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. hirae and e. malodoratus from the enterococci group. additionally, the in vitro antimicrobial activities of pollen against five bacteria species isolated from gastrointestinal tracts of  chickens were tested. the best antimicrobial effect of the pollen extract was detected against k. oxytoca.

AB  == the prevalence of antibiotic resistance and the implicated mechanisms of resistance were evaluated in enterococcus spp. and escherichia coli, isolated from a total of 250 faecal samples of echinoderms collected from azorean waters (portugal). a total of 144 enterococci (120 enterococcus faecium, 14 e. hirae, 8  e. faecalis, 2 e. gallinarum) and 10 e. coli were recovered. high percentages of  resistance in enterococci were found for erythromycin, ampicillin, tetracyclin and ciprofloxacin. the erm(a) or erm(b), tet(m) and/or tet(l), vat(d), aac(6')-aph(2'') and aph(3')-iiia genes were found in isolates resistant to erythromycin, tetracycline, quinupristin/dalfopristin, high-level gentamicin and  high-level kanamycin, respectively. resistance in e. coli isolates was detected for streptomycin, amikacin, tetracycline and tobramycin. the aada gene was found  in streptomycin-resistant isolates and tet(a)+tet(b) genes in tetracycline-resistant isolates. the data recovered are essential to improve knowledge about the dissemination of resistant strains through marine ecosystems  and the possible implications involved in transferring these resistances either to other animals or to humans.

TI  == glucose triggers atp secretion from bacteria in a growth-phase-dependent manner.
AB  == atp modulates immune cell functions, and atp derived from gut commensal bacteria  promotes the differentiation of t helper 17 (th17) cells in the intestinal lamina propria. we recently reported that enterococcus gallinarum, isolated from mice and humans, secretes atp. we have since found and characterized several atp-secreting bacteria. of the tested enterococci, enterococcus mundtii secreted  the greatest amount of atp (>2 mum/10(8) cells) after overnight culture. glucose, not amino acids and vitamins, was essential for atp secretion from e. mundtii. analyses of energy-deprived cells demonstrated that glycolysis is the most important pathway for bacterial atp secretion. furthermore, exponential-phase e.  mundtii and enterococcus faecalis cells secrete atp more efficiently than stationary-phase cells. other bacteria, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus, also secrete atp in exponential but  not stationary phase. these results suggest that various gut bacteria, including  commensals and pathogens, might secrete atp at any growth phase and modulate immune cell function.

TI  == environmental contamination by dog&#8217;s faeces: a public health problem?
AB  == the risk to public health from the large number of dog stools present on streets  of urban areas is cause for concern. dog faeces may be a serious hazard because they may contain microorganisms that are both pathogenic to humans and resistant  to several classes of antibiotics. the aim of this study was to evaluate the potential for zoonotic infections and for the presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in canine faeces which contaminates the urban environment. a total of 418 canine faecal samples were collected from streets in seven areas of bari, southern italy. we have isolated multi-drug resistant enterococci and meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus from these dog faecal samples. the presence of the resistant bacteria in an urban environment may represent a public health hazard which requires control measures by competent authorities. no salmonella, yersinia or campylobacter species were isolated. giardia cysts were detected in 1.9% of the samples. the predominant enterococcus species were e. faecium (61.6%), e. gallinarum (23.3%) and e. casseliflavus (5.5%). other species, including e. faecalis were also isolated. these strains were resistant to clindamycin (86.3%), tetracycline (65.7%), erythromycin (60.27%) and ampicillin (47.9%). high-level aminoglycoside resistance (hlar) was found in 65.7% of enterococci. resistance to three or more antibiotics and six or more antibiotics were observed in 67.12% and 38.4% of enterococcus spp., respectively. resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin was not detected in any of the enterococcus spp. isolated. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 0.7% of the faecal samples. canine faeces left on the streets may represent a risk factor for transmission of microorganisms and a reservoir of multidrug- resistant bacteria thus contributing to the spread of resistance genes into an urban area.

TI  == the effect of glyphosate on potential pathogens and beneficial members of poultry microbiota in vitro.
AB  == the use of glyphosate modifies the environment which stresses the living microorganisms. the aim of the present study was to determine the real impact of  glyphosate on potential pathogens and beneficial members of poultry microbiota in vitro. the presented results evidence that the highly pathogenic bacteria as salmonella entritidis, salmonella gallinarum, salmonella typhimurium, clostridium perfringens and clostridium botulinum are highly resistant to glyphosate. however, most of beneficial bacteria as enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, bacillus badius, bifidobacterium adolescentis and lactobacillus spp. were found to be moderate to highly susceptible. also campylobacter spp. were found to be susceptible to glyphosate. a reduction of beneficial bacteria in the  gastrointestinal tract microbiota by ingestion of glyphosate could disturb the normal gut bacterial community. also, the toxicity of glyphosate to the most prevalent enterococcus spp. could be a significant predisposing factor that is associated with the increase in c. botulinum-mediated diseases by suppressing the antagonistic effect of these bacteria on clostridia.

TI  == vancomycin-resistant enterococci in rooks (corvus frugilegus) wintering throughout europe.
AB  == this study's aims were to assess the prevalence of, and to characterize, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) from rooks (corvus frugilegus) wintering in europe during 2010/2011. faeces samples were cultivated selectively for vre and characterized. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing (mlst) were used to examine epidemiologic relationships of vana-containing vre. the vana-carrying vre were tested in vitro for mobility of vancomycin resistance traits. vre were found in 62 (6%) of 1073 rook samples. enterococcal species diversity comprised enterococcus gallinarum (48 isolates), followed by e. faecium (9) and e. faecalis (5). eight vre harboured the vana and ermb genes. seven vana-carrying vre originated from the czech republic and one from germany.  all vana-carrying vre were identified as e. faecium. based on mlst analysis, six  vana-positive isolates were grouped as st92 type, one isolate belonged to st121,  and the remaining one was described as a novel type st671. seven out of eight isolates were able to transfer the vancomycin resistance trait via filter mating  with a transfer rate of 8.95 +/- 3.25 x 10(-7) transconjugants per donor. in conclusion, wintering rooks in some european countries may disseminate clinically important enterococci and pose a risk for environmental contamination.

TI  == screening fecal enterococci from greek healthy infants for susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == enterococci are among the first lactic acid bacteria to colonize the neonatal gastrointestinal tract, but they are also characterized as significant nosocomial pathogens. the aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of antibiotic resistance in enterococci isolated from neonates' gut microbiota as well as the presence of genetic determinants encoding for certain antibiotic resistance traits. a total of 263 fecal samples derived from 97 infants were collected on day 4, 30, and 90 after delivery. enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently identified species (54.6%) followed by e. faecium, while e. casseliflavus/e. flavescens and e. gallinarum were also traced. the isolates were examined for their resistance to 12 antibiotics. rifampicin resistance was the highest observed (53.2%), followed by resistance to tetracycline (42.0%), erythromycin (35.7%), and vancomycin (11.2%). multiresistant strains were highly prevalent. only intrinsic vancomycin resistance (vanc1 and vanc2/c3) was traced. the ermb gene was detected in 49 out of 96 erythromycin-resistant isolates, while tet genes were detected in 51 out of 113 tetracycline-resistant strains, with tet(l)  being the most frequently observed. in conclusion, antibiotic-resistant enterococci are already established in the fecal microbiota of healthy neonates,  from the first days of an infant's life.

AB  == the aim of this study was to detect and characterize antibiotic-resistant enterococci in seawater and sediment from a mediterranean aquaculture site where  no antibiotics are used. colonies (650) grown on slanetz-bartley (sb) agar were amplified on antibiotic-supplemented sb, and erythromycin (ery), tetracycline (tet), and ampicillin (amp) mics were determined. of 75 resistant isolates (17 to tet, 5 to ery, and 45 to amp), 5 enterococcus faecalis, 25 e. faecium, 5 e. casseliflavus, 1 e. gallinarum, 1 e. durans, and 23 enterococcus spp. were identified by genus- and species-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr). tet(m), tet(o), tet(l), tet(k), erm(b), erm(a), erm(c), mef, msr, blaz, and int(tn916) were sought by pcr, including an improved multiplex pcr assay targeting tet(m), tet(l), and erm(b). tet(m) was the most frequent tet resistance gene; msr(c) was the sole ery resistance gene detected. blaz was found in 29/45 amp-resistant isolates; however, no beta-lactamase production was detected. antibiotic-resistant enterococci were recovered 2 km off the coast despite the absence of selective pressure exerted by antibiotic use. the occurrence of resistant strains in the absence of the tested genes may indicate the presence of less common resistance determinants. this first evidence of resistant enterococci at a mediterranean aquaculture site suggests the existence of a marine reservoir  of antibiotic resistances potentially transmissible to virulent strains that could be affected by mariculture in an antibiotic-independent manner.

TI  == presence of the resistance genes vanc1 and pbp5 in phenotypically vancomycin and  ampicillin susceptible enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == ampicillin and vancomycin are important antibiotics for the therapy of enterococcus faecalis infections. the ampicillin resistance gene pbp5 is intrinsic in enterococcus faecium. the vanc1 gene confers resistance to vancomycin and serves as a species marker for enterococcus gallinarum. both genes are chromosomally located. resistance to ampicillin and vancomycin was determined in 484 e. faecalis of human and porcine origin by microdilution. since e. faecalis are highly skilled to acquire resistance genes, all strains were investigated for the presence of pbp5 (and, in positive strains, for the penicillin-binding protein synthesis repressor gene psr) and vanc1 (and, in positive strains, for vanxyc and vant) by using polymerase chain reaction (pcr).  one porcine and one human isolate were phenotypically resistant to ampicillin; no strain was vancomycin resistant. four e. faecalis (3/1 of porcine/human origin) carried pbp5 (mic=1 mg/l), and four porcine strains were vanc1 positive (minimum  inhibitory concentration [mic]=1 mg/l). real-time reverse transcriptase (rt)-pcr  revealed that the genes were not expressed. the psr gene was absent in the four pbp5-positive strains; the vanxyc gene was absent in the four vanc1-positive strains. however, vant of the vanc gene cluster was detected in two vanc1-positive strains. to our knowledge, this is the first report on the presence of pbp5, identical with the "e. faecium pbp5 gene," and of vanc1/vant in e. faecalis. even if resistance is not expressed in these strains, this study shows that e. faecalis have a strong ability to acquire resistance genes-and potentially to spread them to other bacteria. therefore, close monitoring of this species should be continued.

TI  == multi-drug-resistant enterococcus spp. as a cause of non-responsive septic synovitis in three horses.
AB  == case history: three thoroughbred horses, a 6-week-old filly (case 1), a 15-year-old broodmare (case 2) and a yearling filly (case 3), sustained synovial  sepsis secondary to trauma. clinical findings: case 1 presented with a heel bulb  laceration communicating with the distal interphalangeal joint. arthroscopic lavage was performed and treatment commenced using systemic and local broad spectrum antimicrobial drugs. a pure growth of multi-drug-resistant (mdr) enterococcus gallinarum was cultured from samples of synovium and joint fluid. antimicrobial treatment was changed according to the susceptibility results. response to treatment was poor and despite repeat arthroscopic lavage and intra-osseous regional perfusion of antimicrobials the filly was subject to euthanasia 24 days after the initial injury. post-mortem examination confirmed septic synovitis, cartilage degeneration and osteomyelitis. case 2 sustained a full thickness wound to the carpus which was sharply debrided and closed. the wound dehisced with effusion within the tendon sheath. drainage was established and treatment included systemic broad spectrum antimicrobials, topical lavage with povodine-iodine and manuka honey infusion. a mixed infection including mdr enterococcus faecalis was cultured from the synovial fluid. antebrachiocarpal joint effusion developed 21 days after initial injury and joint sepsis was confirmed. arthroscopic lavage and tendon sheath debridement were performed, followed by treatment with systemic and local antimicrobials. the mare improved and was discharged. three months later lameness recurred and corticosteroids were administered intra-articularly. the mare became non-weight bearing lame and was subject to euthanasia. post-mortem examination confirmed joint sepsis of the antebrachiocarpal and intercarpal joint. case 3 presented with a complete articular open fracture of the tibial crest. under general anaesthesia the fracture was stabilised and the wounds debrided and closed. systemic broad-spectrum antimicrobials were administered. six days later the wound dehisced and a bone fragment was removed. three weeks post-surgery the wound deteriorated with a purulent discharge. culture of the discharge revealed a mixed bacterial infection, including a mdr enterococcus faecalis. femoropatellar joint  involvement was confirmed, and treatment included joint lavage, local and systemic antibiosis, and manuka honey instilled into the wound. the filly initially improved, and then deteriorated such that euthanasia was performed. diagnosis: all three cases had synovial sepsis with mdr enterococcus spp. clinical relevance: increased awareness of mdr pathogens in equine wound infections is essential. prompt diagnostic testing, appropriate therapy, infection control strategies and on-going monitoring and management are vital to  limit the clinical impact of these organisms.

TI  == prevalence and antimicrobial resistance pattern of multidrug-resistant enterococci isolated from clinical specimens.
AB  == purpose: vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) pose an emerging problem in hospitals worldwide. the present study was undertaken to determine the occurrence, species prevalence, antibacterial resistance, and phenotypic and genetic characteristics of vre isolated in riyadh hospitals, ksa. materials and methods: two hundred and six isolates of enterococcal species were obtained from  clinical samples. the antibiotic susceptibility of isolates and minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) tests for vancomycin and teicoplanin were determined. molecular typing of vre isolates was carried out by using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and the resistance genotype was determined by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: vre accounted for 3.9% of the isolates  and were detected mostly in urine, wound and blood specimens isolated from icu, internal medicine and surgical wards. all strains were identified to species level and were found to consist of e. faecalis (69.2%), e. faecium (11.3%), e. avium (2.1%), e. hirae (0.8%), e. casseliflavus (1.3%) and e. gallinarum (1.3%) species. according to the susceptibility data obtained, 8 (3.9%) out of 206 isolates were found to be vre (mics > 32 mug/ml). the vana, vanb and vanc gene fragments of e. faecalis, e. faecium and e. gallinarum were amplified from isolates and were detected. pfge patterns of the vre isolates revealed homogenous patterns with dominant clone suggesting that the strains intrinsic resistance is  independent. conclusions: this study shows an emergence of vre along with increased rate of multidrug-resistant enterococci in the area of the study. regular surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities should be done regularly and the risk factors should be determined.

TI  == comparative genomics of enterococci: variation in enterococcus faecalis, clade structure in e. faecium, and defining characteristics of e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus.
AB  == the enterococci are gram-positive lactic acid bacteria that inhabit the gastrointestinal tracts of diverse hosts. however, enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis have emerged as leading causes of multidrug-resistant hospital-acquired  infections. the mechanism by which a well-adapted commensal evolved into a hospital pathogen is poorly understood. in this study, we examined high-quality draft genome data for evidence of key events in the evolution of the leading causes of enterococcal infections, including e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. casseliflavus, and e. gallinarum. we characterized two clades within what is currently classified as e. faecium and identified traits characteristic of each,  including variation in operons for cell wall carbohydrate and putative capsule biosynthesis. we examined the extent of recombination between the two e. faecium  clades and identified two strains with mosaic genomes. we determined the underlying genetics for the defining characteristics of the motile enterococci e. casseliflavus and e. gallinarum. further, we identified species-specific traits that could be used to advance the detection of medically relevant enterococci and their identification to the species level.

TI  == bacteriophage lysis of enterococcus host strains: a tool for microbial source tracking?
AB  == this paper describes the isolation of enterococcus host strains, for potential use as simple bacteriophage (phage)-based microbial source tracking (mst) tools.  presumptive enterococcus host strains were isolated from cattle feces, raw municipal wastewater, agricultural runoff, and waters impacted by farms or wastewater treatment works (wwtw) in southern england, united kingdom (uk). all enterococcal host strains (n = 390) were first screened for their ability to detect phage in samples of raw municipal wastewater and fecal material from cattle, pigs, and sheep. host strains that detected phage (n = 147) were ranked according to both their specificity to a particular fecal source and also the number of phages (expressed as plaque-forming units, pfu) that they detected per  milliliter of sample. host strains that demonstrated host specificity and which detected phages at levels greater than 100 pfu/ml (n = 29) were further tested using additional fecal samples of human and nonhuman origin. the specificity and  sensitivity of the enterococcal host strains were found to vary, ranging from 44  to 100% and from 17 to 83%, respectively. most notably, seven strains exhibited 100% specificity to either cattle, human, or pig samples. isolates exhibiting specificity to cattle were identified as belonging to the species enterococcus casseliflavus , enterococcus mundtii , or enterococcus gallinarum , while human and pig isolates were members of either enterococcus faecium or enterococcus faecalis . the high specificity of phages infecting enterococcus hosts and the simplicity and relatively low cost of the approach collectively indicate a strong potential for using this method as a tool in mst.

TI  == [the relationship between antibiotic resistance and virulence factors in urinary  enterococcus isolates].
AB  == increasing multidrug resistance in nosocomial enterococcus strains from all over  the world recently enhances the need for further investigation of enterococci, especially their virulence factors. there are still many lacking parts about virulence factors of clinical enterococcus isolates. in this study, it was aimed  to investigate the antibiotic resistance and the presence of potential virulence  factors of 91 enterococcus strains (59 e.faecalis, 31 e.faecium and 1 e.gallinarum) isolated from urine cultures of inpatients between january 2008-june 2010 in our hospital and also to evaluate whether a correlation existed between antibiotic resistance and potential virulence factors. the genes which encoded virulence factors of enterococci; aggregation substance (as), enterococcal surface protein (esp) and hyaluronidase (hyl) (asa1, esp, hyl respectively) were studied by molecular methods and haemolysin production and gelatinase activity were studied by phenotypic methods. vancomycin resistant strains were checked for the presence of vana and vanb genes. eight (25.8%) e.faecium isolates were found glycopeptide resistant. in seven of these isolates  resistance type was vana and in one it was neither vana nor vanb. high-level gentamicin and high-level streptomycin resistance rates were 74.2% and 61.3% in e.faecium strains and were 22% ve 27.1% in e.faecalis strains, respectively. beta-lactamase production and linezolid resistance were not detected in any of the strains. e.faecium isolates were more resistant (p< 0.001-0.013) than e.faecalis isolates to all tested antibiotics except tetracycline, minocycline, doxycycline and streptogramin (p< 0.001). hyl gene positivity (p< 0.001) was found higher in e.faecium isolates whereas esp (p= 0.003) and asa1 (p< 0.001) gene positivity, haemolysin production (p=0.014) and gelatinase activity (p= 0.029) were higher in e.faecalis isolates. as and esp were the most frequent virulence factors, with the rates of 26.7% and 25.6%, respectively. there were 32 (35.6%) strains without any of the investigated virulence factors. we have also detected that asa1 gene positive e.faecalis isolates were more resistant to ciprofloxacin (p= 0.001), norfloxacin (p= 0.006) and levofloxacin (p= 0.001) than asa1 gene negative isolates; esp gene positive e.faecalis isolates were more resistant to doxycycline (p= 0.043) than esp gene negative isolates and hyl gene  positive e.faecium isolates were more resistant to nitrofurantoine (p= 0.011) than hyl gene negative isolates. this was the first clinical sample originated study, investigating the corelation between antibiotic resistance and virulence factors in urinary enterococcus isolates in turkey.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in faecal microbiota of greek healthy infants.
AB  == increasing use of antibiotics for the treatment of infectious diseases and also for non-therapeutic reasons (agriculture, animal husbandry and aquaculture) has led to the increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance and the ineffectiveness  of antimicrobial treatment. commensal intestinal bacteria are very often exposed  to the selective pressure of antimicrobial agents and may constitute a reservoir  of antibiotic resistance determinants that can be transferred to pathogens. the present study aimed to investigate the antibiotic susceptibility profile and the  presence of selected resistance genes in cocci isolated from the faecal microbiota of 35 healthy, full-term infants at 4, 30 and 90 days after delivery.  a total of 148 gram-positive, catalase-negative cocci were isolated and tested for susceptibility to 12 different antibiotics by disk-diffusion technique. multiplex pcr analysis was performed for the identification of enterococcus spp.  isolates and the simultaneous detection of vancomycin-resistance genes. pcr-based methodology was used also for identification of tetracycline and erythromycin resistance determinants. identification results indicated e. faecalis as the predominant species (81 strains), followed by e. faecium, e. casseliflavus/e. flavescens and e. gallinarum. high prevalence of resistance to tetracycline (39.9%), erythromycin (35.1%), vancomycin (19.6%) and to nucleic acid synthesis inhibitors was detected. pcr data revealed 24 out of 52 erythromycin-resistant isolates carrying the ermb gene and 32 out of 59 tetracycline-resistant strains carrying tet genes, with tet(l) determinant being the most frequently detected. only intrinsic vancomycin resistance (vanc1 and vanc2/c3) was reported among tested isolates. in conclusion, erythromycin and tetracycline acquired resistant  traits are widespread among faecal cocci isolates from greek, healthy infants under no apparent antimicrobial selective pressure.

TI  == first detection of the staphylococcal trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk and the dfrk-carrying transposon tn559 in enterococci.
AB  == the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk has been recently described in staphylococcus aureus, but so far has not been found in other bacteria. a total of 166 enterococci of different species (e. faecium, e. faecalis, e. hirae, e. durans, e. gallinarum, and e. casseliflavus) and origins (food, clinical diseases in humans, healthy humans or animals, and sewage) were studied for their susceptibility to trimethoprim as determined by agar dilution (european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing) and the presence of (a) the dfrk gene and its genetic environment and (b) other dfr genes. the dfrk gene was detected in 49% of the enterococci (64% and 42% of isolates with minimum inhibitory concentrations of >/=2 mg/l or </=1 mg/l, respectively). the tet(l)-dfrk linkage  was detected in 21% of dfrk-positive enterococci. the chromosomal location of the dfrk gene was identified in one e. faecium isolate in which the dfrk was not linked to tet(l) gene but was part of a tn559 element, which was integrated in the chromosomal radc gene. this tn559 element was also found in 14 additional isolates. all combinations of dfr genes were detected among the isolates tested (dfrk, dfrg, dfrf, dfrk+dfrg, dfrk+dfrf, dfrf+dfrg, and dfrf+dfrg+dfrk). the gene dfrk gene was found together with other dfr genes in 58% of the tested enterococci. this study suggested an exchange of the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk between enterococci and staphylococci, as previously observed for the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrg.

TI  == non-susceptibility to tigecycline in enterococci from hospitalised patients, food products and community sources.
AB  == in this study, the in vitro activity of tigecycline against 1140 enterococci collected from humans, food products, animals and the environment in portugal (1996-2008) was analysed. ten isolates (seven enterococcus faecalis and three enterococcus spp.) non-susceptible to tigecycline (minimum inhibitory concentrations of 0.5-1.0 mg/l), which were also resistant to tetracycline and minocycline, were mostly observed in samples collected before the introduction of tigecycline in the therapeutic arsenal. the e. faecalis isolates were recovered from hospitalised patients (n=2; st319/cc2 and st34), healthy humans (n=2; st21/cc21), chicken meat (n=1; st260) as well as from two swine samples. the remaining isolates were also recovered from chicken meat (n=1; enterococcus gallinarum) and swine (n=2; enterococcus hirae and enterococcus spp.). recovery of enterococcal isolates with reduced susceptibility to tigecycline amongst different reservoirs, including animals for food consumption, suggests that selection of tigecycline-resistant isolates by antibiotics other than tigecycline might occur in non-clinical settings.

AB  == vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) are common nosocomial pathogens; however,  until now they have been rarely encountered in hungary. in the present study, we  investigated the prevalence of vre in the teaching hospitals of the university of debrecen. of 7,271 enterococcus-containing clinical samples collected between 2004 and 2009, we identified 16 vre. species-specific polymerase chain reaction was used to detect enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus casseliflavus, and enterococcus gallinarum. multiplex polymerase chain reaction was performed to identify the vancomycin resistance genes: vana, vanb, vanc1/c2,  vand, vane, and vang. restriction digestion with sali and hindiii was introduced  to differentiate the vanc1 and vanc2 genes from each other. genetic relationships between the strains were investigated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. overall, we identified the vanc1 resistance gene in 14 e. gallinarum and the vanc2 resistance gene in two e. casseliflavus strains. except for two samples, the isolates had different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis types, suggesting sporadic emergence of the resistant bacteria. in addition, antibiotic resistance  profile was determined by e-test. three e. gallinarum strains proved to be resistant to gentamicin because of the presence of the aaca-aphd gene. although the prevalence of vre in debrecen is rather low, the appearance of multiple resistances is of concern.

AB  == enterococci are a frequent cause of a variety of human infections, the most common being urinary tract infection followed by bacteraemia, meningitis and endocarditis from hospitalized patients. objective: the study and monitoring of antibiotic resistance of enterococci strains isolated and confirmed in 2009. materials and methods: identification of 30 strains received in 2009 was based on phenotypic characteristics (microscopy, culture and biochemical characters); antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed according to clsi standards 2009  by diffusion test and mic by agar dilution and e-test. result: the strains belonged to the following species: e. faecalis (18), e. faecium (6), e. gallinarum (5), and e. durans (1), and were isolated from: blood cultures, urine, pus-wound, cerebrospinal fluid (csf) and catheter. antibiotic susceptibility testing showed susceptibility to different antibiotics depending on the species and also on the type of clinical samples. conclusions: due to the small number of strains, no resistance phenotypes could be determined. as emergence of antibiotic resistant enterococci is well known, continuous surveillance of antibiotic susceptibility and molecular study of this issue are required.

TI  == species distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococci isolated from broilers infected experimentally with eimeria spp and fed with diets containing different supplements.
AB  == resistant bacteria in animal can be spread to environment and to humans. poultry  feed and infections caused by eimeria spp. are important factors in determining the intestinal microbial communities. the aim of this study was to verify the prevalence of species and antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococcus isolated from broilers fed with different supplements and infected experimentally with eimeria spp. broilers were divided in eight groups, fed with diets supplemented with a combination of antimicrobial, ionophore-coccidiostatics, probiotic, essential oil. at 14 days old all birds, except the control, received a solution  containing oocysts of eimeria spp. samples of cloacal swabs from broilers were collected. a total of 240 enterococcus sp. strains were isolated, confirmed genus by pcr, classified as species, tested for antimicrobial susceptibility and screened by pcr for the presence of tet(l), tet(m) and erm(b) genes. the overall  distribution of species isolated from fecal samples was e. faecalis (40%), followed by e. casseliflavus/e. gallinarum (10.8%), e. mundtii (10.8%), e. faecium (10.8%), e. columbae (5.8%) and e. gallinarum (4.2%). changes in the composition or frequency of enterococcus species were observed in all dietary supplementation. antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed resistance phenotypes  a range of antibiotics, especially used in humans such as, streptomycin, penicillin, rifampicin and vancomycin. there was no correlation between different supplementation for broilers and antimicrobial resistance and the presence of tet(m), tet(l) and erm(b) genes. dietary supplementation had effect on the enterococcus sp. colonization, but did not have significant effect on the phenotype and genotype of antimicrobial resistance in enterococci.

TI  == bacteriophage-mediated transduction of antibiotic resistance in enterococci.
AB  == aims: temperate bacteriophages are bacterial viruses that transfer genetic information between bacteria. this phenomenon is known as transduction, and it is important in acquisition of bacterial virulence genes and antimicrobial resistance determinants. the aim of this study was to demonstrate the role of bacteriophages in gene transfer (antibiotic resistance) in enterococci. methods and results: three bacteriophages from environmental samples isolated on pig host strains of enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus faecalis were evaluated in transduction experiments. antibiotic resistance was transferred from ent. gallinarum to ent. faecalis (tetracycline resistance) and from ent. faecalis to enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae/durans and enterococcus casseliflavus (gentamicin resistance). conclusions: bacteriophages play a role in transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants in enterococci. significance and impact of the study: this study confirms previous suggestions on transduction in enterococci, in particular on interspecies transduction. interspecies transduction is significant because it widens the range of recipients involved in antimicrobial resistance transfer.

TI  == development of a dna microarray for enterococcal species, virulence, and antibiotic resistance gene determinations among isolates from poultry.
AB  == a dna microarray (enteroarray) was designed with probes targeting four species-specific taxonomic identifiers to discriminate among 18 different enterococcal species, while other probes were designed to identify 18 virulence factors and 174 antibiotic resistance genes. in total, 262 genes were utilized for rapid species identification of enterococcal isolates, while characterizing their virulence potential through the simultaneous identification of endogenous antibiotic resistance and virulence genes. enterococcal isolates from broiler chicken farms were initially identified by using the api 20 strep system, and the results were compared to those obtained with the taxonomic genes atpa, reca, phes, and ddl represented on our microarray. among the 171 isolates studied, five different enterococcal species were identified by using the api 20 strep system:  enterococcus faecium, e. faecalis, e. durans, e. gallinarum, and e. avium. the enteroarray detected the same species as api 20 strep, as well as two more: e. casseliflavus and e. hirae. species comparisons resulted in 15% (27 isolates) disagreement between the two methods among the five api 20 strep identifiable species and 24% (42 isolates) disagreement when considering the seven enteroarray identified species. the species specificity of key antibiotic and virulence genes identified by the enteroarray were consistent with the literature adding further  robustness to the redundant taxonomic probe data. sequencing of the cpn60 gene further confirmed the complete accuracy of the microarray results. the new enteroarray should prove to be a useful tool to accurately genotype strains of enterococci and assess their virulence potential.

AB  == forty-eight isolates resistant to at least two antibiotics were selected from 53  antibiotic-resistant enterococci from chicken and pig meat and faeces and analysed for specific resistance determinants. of the 48 multidrug-resistant (mdr) strains, 31 were resistant to two antibiotics (29 to erythromycin and tetracycline, 1 to erythromycin and vancomycin, 1 to vancomycin and tetracycline), 14 to three (erythromycin, tetracycline and vancomycin or ampicillin) and 3 to four (erythromycin, vancomycin, ampicillin and gentamicin).  erm(b), tet(m), vana and aac (6')-ie aph (2'')-ia were the antibiotic resistance  genes most frequently detected. all 48 mdr enterococci were susceptible to linezolid and daptomycin. enterococcus faecalis (16), enterococcus faecium (8), enterococcus mundtii (2) and enterococcus gallinarum (1) were identified in meat, and e. faecium (13) and enterococcus durans (13) in faeces. clonal spread was not detected, suggesting a large role of gene transfer in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance. conjugative transfer of resistance genes was more successful when donors were enterococcal strains isolated from faeces; co-transfer of vana and erm(b) to a human e. faecium occurred from both e. faecium and e. durans pig faecal strains. these data show that multidrug resistance can be found in food and animal species other than e. faecium and e. faecalis, and that these species can efficiently transfer antibiotic resistance to human strains in inter-specific matings. in particular, the occurrence of mdr  e. durans in the animal reservoir could have a role in the emergence of human enterococcal infections difficult to eradicate with antibiotics.

AB  == enterococcus isolates (1500) obtained from the feces of 48 humans, 209 domesticated food animals, and 155 wild geese in south korea were characterized with respect to species status by pcr analyses and resistance to antibiotics. of  the 1500 strains examined, the majority (n=577) were enterococcus faecalis from 224 (54.4%) of the samples feces, while 299 were of e. faecium from 125 of the samples (30.3%), 224 were e. hirae from 101 (24.5%) of the samples, 94 were e. casseliflavus from 43 (10.4%) of the samples, and one was e. gallinarum. while 305 isolated from 125 (30.3%) of the samples were unidentified species. approximately 15, 60, 50, 55, 3, and 40% of samples obtained from beef cattle, chickens, ducks, swine, wild geese, and humans, respectively, yielded enterococcus isolates that were resistant to high-levels of aminoglycosides (i.e., of gentamicin, kanamycin, and streptomycin, minimum inhibitory concentrations were >1000 mg/l). the 180 enterococcus isolates that showed high levels of resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics (hlar) were screened for virulence genes encoding for aggregation substance (agg), cytolysin activator (cyla), gelatinase (gele) and surface protein (esp). of those, the gele gene was  found most frequently in chickens and ducks of the hlar isolates, while 56 e. faecalis and 13 e. faecium hlar were gelatinase positive and showed hemolysin activity. multiple antibiotic resistant enterococcus isolates carrying virulence  genes were most frequently isolated from poultry and swine, and were mostly e. faecalis or e. faecium. these findings suggest that restriction of the use of antibiotics in food animal operations in south korea, especially those involved in poultry and swine production would be desirable.

AB  == enterococci are now frequent causative agents of nosocomial infections. in this study, we analyzed the frequency and distribution of antibiotic resistance and virulence genotypes of enterococcus isolates from broiler chickens. fecal and cecal samples from nine commercial poultry farms were collected to quantify total enterococci. sixty-nine presumptive enterococci were isolated and identified by api 20 strep, and their susceptibilities to antibiotics were determined. genotypes were assessed through the use of a novel dna microarray carrying 70 taxonomic, 17 virulence, and 174 antibiotic resistance gene probes. total enterococcal counts were different from farm to farm and between sample sources (p < 0.01). fifty-one (74%) of the isolates were identified as e. faecium, whereas nine (13%), seven (10%), and two (3%) isolates were identified as e. hirae, e. faecalis, and e. gallinarum, respectively. multiple-antibiotic resistance was evident in e. faecium and e. faecalis isolates. the most common multiple-antibiotic resistance phenotype was bac ery tyl lin str gen tet cip. genes conferring resistance to aminoglycoside (aac, aaca-aphd, aadb, apha, sat4), macrolide (erma, ermb, ermam, msrc), tetracycline (tetl, tetm, teto), streptogramin (satg_vate8), bacitracin (bcrr), and lincosamide (linb) antibiotics were detected in corresponding phenotypes. a range of 9 to 12 different virulence genes was found in e. faecalis, including ace, agg, agrb(efs) (agrb gene of e. faecalis), cad1, the cam373 and ccf10 genes, cob, cpd1, cylab, efaa(efs), and gele. all seven e. faecalis isolates were found to carry the gele gene and to hydrolize gelatin and bile salts. results from this study showed the presence of  enterococci of public and environmental health concerns in broiler chicken farms  and demonstrated the utility of a microarray to quickly and reliably analyze resistance and virulence genotypes of enterococcus spp.

AB  == antibiotic resistance in animal isolates of enterococci is of public health concern because of the risk of transfer of antibiotic resistance isolates or resistance determinants to consumers via the food chain. in this study, phenotypic and genotypic resistance in 192 pig isolates of enterococci to ampicillin, avilamycin, avoparcin, bacitracin, flavophospholipol, gentamicin, narasin, tetracycline, tiamulin, tylosin, vancomycin, virginiamycin, copper and zinc were investigated by susceptibility test and molecular methods. resistance rates varied between the species but all isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, avilamycin, avoparcin, gentamicin and narasin but resistant to tetracycline and tylosin and intermediately resistant to copper. only enterococcus gallinarum and  enterococcus casseliflavus were resistant to vancomycin and virginiamycin resistance was present in less than half the enterococcus faecium isolates. zinc  resistance was largely confined to enterococcus faecalis but bacitracin resistance was uncommon in e. faecalis in comparison with the other species. tiamulin resistance was common in all species except e. casseliflavus. resistance to flavophospholipol was detected in most e. faecium isolates and in a high proportion of e. gallinarum, e. casseliflavus and e. hirae/durans but was only found in one isolate of e. faecalis. no teto, rplc, rpld, vana, vanb, vata and vatd genes were found. the presence of ermb, tetl, tetm, tcrb, aac6-aph2, tetk, tets, vanc1, vanc2, lsaa, lsab and vate varied between the species and largely corresponded to the susceptibility phenotype. the findings show that resistance to antibiotics of high clinical significance for nosocomial enterococcus infections is absent, whereas antimicrobial resistance was detected for some other antibiotics including bacitracin, flavophospholipol, tetracycline, tiamulin, tylosin and virginiamycin.

TI  == ccrabent serine recombinase genes are widely distributed in the enterococcus faecium and enterococcus casseliflavus species groups and are expressed in e. faecium.
AB  == the presence, distribution and expression of cassette chromosome recombinase (ccr) genes, which are homologous to the staphylococcal ccrab genes and are designated ccrab(ent) genes, were examined in enterococcal isolates (n=421) representing 13 different species. a total of 118 (28 %) isolates were positive for ccrab(ent) genes by pcr, and a number of these were confirmed by southern hybridization with a ccra(ent) probe (n=76) and partial dna sequencing of ccra(ent) and ccrb(ent) genes (n=38). ccrab(ent) genes were present in enterococcus faecium (58/216, 27 %), enterococcus durans (31/38, 82 %), enterococcus hirae (27/52, 50 %), enterococcus casseliflavus (1/4, 25 %) and enterococcus gallinarum (1/2, 50 %). in the eight other species tested, including enterococcus faecalis (n=94), ccrab(ent) genes were not found. thirty-eight sequenced ccrab(ent) genes from five different enterococcal species showed 94-100 % nucleotide sequence identity and linkage pcrs showed heterogeneity in the ccrab(ent) flanking chromosomal genes. expression analysis of ccrab(ent) genes from the e. faecium do strain showed constitutive expression as a bicistronic mrna. the ccrab(ent) mrna levels were lower during log phase than stationary phase in relation to total mrna. multilocus sequence typing was performed on 39 isolates. ccrab(ent) genes were detected in both hospital-related (10/29, 34 %) and non-hospital (4/10, 40 %) strains of e. faecium. various sequence types were  represented by both ccrab(ent) positive and negative isolates, suggesting acquisition or loss of ccrab(ent) in e. faecium. in summary, ccrab(ent) genes, potentially involved in genome plasticity, are expressed in e. faecium and are widely distributed in the e. faecium and e. casseliflavus species groups.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of fecal indicators in municipal wastewater treatment plant.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance of fecal coliforms (n = 153) and enterococci (n = 199) isolates was investigated in municipal wastewater treatment plant (wwtp) based on activated sludge system. the number of fecal indicators (in influent and effluent as well as in the aeration chamber and in return activated sludge mixture) was determined using selective media. susceptibility of selected strains was tested against 19 (aminoglycosides, aztreonam, carbapenems, cephalosporins, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors, fluoroquinolones, penicillines, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) and 17 (high-level aminoglycosides, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, fluoroquinolones, glycopeptides, linezolid, lincosamides, nitrofuration, streptogramins, tetracycline) antimicrobial agents respectively. among enterococci the predominant species were enterococcus faecium (60.8%) and enterococcus faecalis (22.1%), while remaining isolates belonged to enterococcus hirae (12.1%), enterococcus casseliflavus/gallinarum (4.5%), and enterococcus durans (0.5%). resistance to nitrofuration and erythromycin was common among enterococci (53% and 44%, respectively), and followed by resistance to ciprofloxacin (29%) and tetracycline (20%). the resistance phenotypes related to glycopeptides (up to 3.2%) and high-level aminoglycosides (up to 5.4%) were also observed. most frequently, among escherichia coli isolates the resistance patterns were found for ampicillin (34%), piperacillin (24%) and tetracycline (23%). extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing e. coli was detected once, in the aeration chamber. in the study the applied wastewater treatment processes considerably reduced the number of fecal indicators. nevertheless their number in the wwtp effluent was higher than 10(4) cfu per 100 ml and periodically contained 90% of bacteria with antimicrobial resistance patterns. the positive selection of isolates with antimicrobial resistance patterns was observed during the treatment processes. substantial concern should be paid to the isolates resistant to 3 or more chemical classes of antimicrobials (mar). in treated wastewater mar e. coli  and mar enterococci constituted respectively 9% and 29% of tested isolates.

TI  == stored-product insects carry antibiotic-resistant and potentially virulent enterococci.
AB  == a total of 154 enterococcal isolates from 95 stored-product insects collected from a feed mill, a grain storage silo, and a retail store were isolated and identified to the species level using pcr. enterococcus casseliflavus represented 51% of the total isolates, followed by enterococcus gallinarum (24%), enterococcus faecium (14%), enterococcus faecalis (7%), and enterococcus hirae (5%). many isolates were resistant to tetracycline (48%), followed by streptomycin (21%), erythromycin (14%), kanamycin (13%), ciprofloxacin (12%), ampicillin (4%), and chloramphenicol (<1%). enterococci carried genes coding for  virulence factors, including the gelatinase gene gele (26% of isolates), an enterococcal surface protein gene esp (1%), and the cytolysin gene cyla (2%). an  aggregation substance (asa1) gene was detected in six out of 10 e. faecalis isolates and five of these were positive for the aggregation substance. enterococci were positive for hemolytic (57% of isolates) and gelatinolytic (23%) activity. the filter-mating assay showed that the tetracycline resistance gene, tetm, was transferable among e. faecalis by conjugation. these data demonstrated  that stored-product insects can serve as potential vectors in disseminating antibiotic-resistant and potentially virulent enterococci.

TI  == identification and antimicrobial resistance of enterococcus spp. isolated from surface water.
AB  == in the study species distributions and antimicrobial resistance profiles were determined among riverine enterococcus spp. susceptibility of the isolates was tested against: ampicillin, imipenem, teicoplanin, vancomycin, erythromycin, linezolid, fosfomycin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, tetracycline, high levels of gentamicin and streptomycin. the enterococci were detected in all  of the analyzed water samples, periodically exceeding the mandatory standards of  the eu bathing water directive. isolates were predominantly e. faecium (68.6%) and e. faecalis (21.6%) strains. the remaining isolates belonged to e. casseliflavus/gallinarum (5.2%), e. hirae (3.9%), and e. durans (0.7%). of enterococci strains, 27% were susceptible to all tested antimicrobial agents and  as much as 9% were classified as multiple-antibiotic-resistant (mar). resistance  to erythromycin was common in all investigated areas (55%), followed by resistance to ciprofloxacin (22%) and tetracycline (14%). the resistance phenotypes related to glycopeptides and high-level aminoglycosides were also observed. relatively low frequency of ampicillin resistance was found among studied strains, in contrast to the frequent use of this antimicrobial agent in poland. according to the obtained results the enterococcus should be regarded as  an important genus, according to its potential contribution to dissemination of antimicrobial resistance in the water environment.

TI  == enterococcus species composition determined by capillary electrophoresis of the groesl gene spacer region dna.
AB  == marine recreational beaches are monitored for fecal contamination by enterococcus spp. (ent) counts. although different ent species in the environment tend to thrive in and originate from distinct hosts, the current monitoring method does not differentiate among species. time-consuming isolation-based species identification precludes routine analysis of environmental ent communities. therefore, an isolation-independent dna fingerprinting method was developed to characterize environmental ent communities using dna length polymorphism of the spacer region between the groes and groel genes common to most ent species. capillary electrophoresis resulted in distinct peak sizes of pcr products that carried polymorphic groesl spacers (300-335 bp in length) among 8 different ent species (enterococcus avium, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, and enterococcus faecalis). distortions in true species ratios observed in electropherograms were caused by pcr biases arising in a mixed ent community dna template. e. faecalis was overestimated and e. avium and e. faecium were underestimated compared to the original species ratios in the mixed community. the pcr product bias was constant between species, so good approximation of the species ratio in ent communities is possible. in environmental samples, a high percentage of e. faecalis (96%) together with high total ent counts were observed in samples collected from a sewer line and from several sites in a storm drain system where sewage leaks were suspected. in contrast, samples with <400 cfu 100  ml-1 ent were either dominated by e. mundtii or had 4 or more ent species. the latter ent community profiles are considered to be signatures of enterococci rarely associated with animals with low or of non-fecal origin.

TI  == [detection of vancomycin-resistant enterococci using multiplex real-time pcr assay and melting curve analysis].
AB  == background: we developed and evaluated the utility of a multiplex real-time pcr assay that uses melting curve analysis and allows simultaneous identification of  vancomycin-resistant genotypes and clinically relevant enterococci. methods: the  specificity of the assay was tested using 4 reference strains of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and 2 reference strains of vancomycin-susceptible enterococci. ninety-three clinical isolates of enterococci with different glycopeptide-resistant phenotypes were genotyped and identified using a multiplex real-time pcr assay and melting curve analysis. results: representative melting curves were obtained for enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, vana-containing e. faecium, vanb-containing e. faecalis, enterococcus gallinarum, and enterococcus casseliflavus. phenotypic and genotypic analysis of the isolates revealed same results for 82 enterococcal isolates, while in 4 isolates, the glycopeptide-resistant phenotypes were inconsistent with the glycopeptide-resistant genotypes and in the 4 other isolates, species could not be accurately identified. three isolates with mixed strains, which were detected by the pcr assay, could not be correctly identified using phenotypic methods. conclusions: vre genotyping and identification of clinically relevant enterococci were rapidly and correctly performed using multiplex real-time pcr assay and melting curve analysis.

TI  == bacteremia caused by non-faecalis and non-faecium enterococcus species at a medical center in taiwan, 2000 to 2008.
AB  == summary objectives: human infections due to non-faecalis and non-faecium enterococcus species are emerging but data on the characteristics of these infections are limited. methods: we retrospectively reviewed the computerized database of the bacteriology laboratory at national taiwan university hospital from january 2000 through december 2008 to identify patients with non-faecalis and non-faecium enterococcal bacteremia. results: enterococcal bacteremia was diagnosed in 1887 patients during the study period and was caused by non-faecalis and non-faecium enterococci in 182 (9.6%) of these patients. the causative organisms included enterococcus casseliflavus (n = 59, 3.1%), enterococcus gallinarum (n = 58, 3.0%), enterococcus avium (n = 45, 2.4%), enterococcus hirae  (n = 9, 0.5%), enterococcus raffinosus (n = 9, 0.5%), enterococcus durans (n = 2, 0.1%), enterococcus cecorum (n = 2, 0.1%), and enterococcus canintestini (n = 1,  0.5%). a commercially-available phenotypic identification system misidentified six isolates based upon sequence analysis of 16s and groesl genes. among the 182  patients, 74 (40.7%) had catheter-associated bloodstream infection and 69 (37.9%) presented with biliary tract infection. healthcare-associated enterococcal bacteremia comprised 99 (54.4%) episodes and a polymicrobial etiology was found in 106 (58.2%) episodes. the clinical manifestations varied between the infecting enterococcus species. multivariate logistic regression showed that immunocompromised status is the only risk factor for the all cause mortality. conclusions: non-faecalis and non-faecium enterococcus species can cause protean  manifestations which vary with the infecting enterococcus species. misidentification of unusual enterococcal species might occur by the commercial identification methods and accurate identification with molecular methods is required.

TI  == prevalence and antibiotic resistance profiles of enterococcus species in chicken  at slaughter level; absence of vana and vanb genes in e. faecalis and e. faecium.
AB  == the prevalence of enterococci in neck skin samples of poultry from ankara region  in turkey was investigated and their antibiotic resistance patterns were determined. in the study, 83 of 106 analyzed neck skin samples were positive for  enterococcus, with e. faecium as the most prevalent species (48%) followed by e.  durans (23%) and e. faecalis (19%). lower numbers were detected for e. gallinarum, e. hirae, e. mundtii and e. casseliflavus. using the disc diffusion method, it was established that over 90% of e. faecium and e. faecalis isolates were high-level resistant against erythromycin and tetracycline. four e. faecium  isolates were additionally resistant to chloramphenicol, gentamicin and streptomycin, though they were susceptible to penicillin g. the most frequently observed multiple resistance in e. faecium (25%) was against erythromycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and streptomycin. of the e. faecalis isolates, 44%  were multiple resistant to erythromycin, tetracycline and streptomycin. vancomycin resistance could not be demonstrated phenotypically and vana or vanb genes were not detected by multiplex pcr in any of the isolates. nevertheless, the observed resistance patterns are of concern for public health.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of enterococci isolated from mastitic bovine milk samples in korea.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial resistance of various species of enterococci isolated from mastitic bovine milk samples. a total of 105 enterococci isolates were examined: enterococcus faecalis (n = 47), enterococcus  faecium (n = 39), enterococcus gallinarum (n = 6), enterococcus avium (n = 6), enterococcus hirae (n = 5) and enterococcus durans (n = 2). all the isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin and vancomycin, and only a single e. hirae  isolate was resistant to ampicillin. in general, the most frequently observed resistance among the enterococcal isolates was to tetracycline (69.5%), followed  by penicillin (64.7%), erythromycin (57.1%) and cephalothin (44.7%). a similar antimicrobial resistance pattern was observed among individual species except e.  durans, which exhibited only tetracycline resistance. resistance observed among isolates of e. hirae and e. gallinarum was almost as high as e. faecium and e. faecalis. of 105 isolates, only six (5.7%) strains of e. faecium were susceptible to all the antimicrobials tested and about 52% (55/105) showed resistance to more than three antimicrobials. the most common multiple resistance pattern was penicillin, tetracycline and erythromycin, which was observed in 32 of 105 (30.4%) isolates. this study demonstrates that enterococcal isolates belonging to minor species showed antimicrobial resistance rates as high as those of e. faecium and e. faecalis, and that monitoring of antimicrobial resistance should not be restricted only to those two major species.

AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) cross-transmission between two patient groups (long-term dialysis and kidney transplant patients). molecular typing, by  automated ribotyping with the riboprinter microbial characterization system (qualicon, usa), was used to analyze vre isolates from 31 fecal samples of 320 dialysis patients and 38 fecal samples of 280 kidney transplant patients. clonal  spread of e. faecalis and e. casseliflavus was observed intragroup, but not between the two groups of patients. in turn, transmission of e. gallinarum and e. faecium between the groups was suggested by the finding of vancomycin-resistant isolates belonging to the same ribogroup in both dialysis and transplant patients. the fact that these patients were colonized by vre from the same ribogroup in the same health care facility provides evidence for cross-transmission and supports the adoption of stringent infection control measures to prevent dissemination of these bacteria.

AB  == the goal of this study was to assess the presence of enterococci species presenting van-mediated glycopeptide resistance in french cattle. fecal samples were collected from healthy and sick animals, and enterococci were screened for vancomycin resistance. vancomycin resistance was principally encountered in enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus strains. however, glycopeptide resistance was detected in three different species of enterococci (e. faecalis, e. faecium, and e. casseliflavus). molecular characterization of the genetic support proved that they all presented the prototypic vana element. interestingly, the e. casseliflavus strain displayed a remarkable vanb phenotype/vana-vanc genotype. transferability, associated resistances, and factors of vana cotransfer were sought. this study proved that acquired vana genes can still be detected in food-producing animals more than a decade after the avoparcin ban. indeed, calves, which are recurrently exposed to antibiotics in france, may allow the re-emergence of glycopeptide resistance through coselection factors, and this might potentially be concerning for human health.

AB  == staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus are the leading causative agents of indwelling medical device infections because of their ability to form biofilms on artificial surfaces. here we describe the antibiofilm activity of a class of small molecules, the aryl rhodanines, which specifically inhibit biofilm formation of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and e. gallinarum but not the gram-negative species pseudomonas aeruginosa or escherichia coli. the aryl rhodanines do not exhibit antibacterial activity against any of the bacterial strains tested and are not cytotoxic against hela cells. preliminary mechanism-of-action studies revealed that the aryl rhodanines  specifically inhibit the early stages of biofilm development by preventing attachment of the bacteria to surfaces.

AB  == proteolytic cleavage of hemagglutinin is required for cell entry by receptor-mediated endocytosis and plays a key role in pathogenicity of the influenza virus. despite several studies describing relationships between bacterial proteases and influenza a viral activation in mammals, very little is known about the role of the normal bacterial flora of birds on hemagglutinin activation. we examined the indigenous intestinal microflora of 100 mixed-sex, 27-d-old ross chickens from a commercial poultry facility for protease-secreting  bacteria. protease-secreting bacteria were isolated from 82 of 100 chickens with  50 birds exhibiting 2 or more protease-secreting bacterial species. a total of 20 protease-secreting bacterial species were identified: 17 gram-positive cocci, 2 gram-positive rods, and 1 gram-negative rod. enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus  gallinarum, and proteus mirabilis were the most frequently observed protease-secreting bacterial species. the presence of proteolytic bacteria in the intestinal tract of poultry in this study suggests the possibility of yet-to-be-described role(s) in cleavage of hemagglutinin that may alter the pathogenicity of avian influenza viruses.

TI  == prevalence and antibiotic-resistance characteristics of enterococcus spp. isolated from free-living and captive raptors in central illinois.
AB  == due to their predatory nature, raptor species may serve as important indicators of environmental contamination with antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. raptors prey on small rodents and birds that have diverse habitat ranges, including urban and rural environments, and their intestinal microflora can reflect that of the animals on which they feed. enterococcus spp. were selected as target organisms because they have been isolated from the avian gastrointestinal tract, can be conferred by prey items, and because they are capable of multiple resistance patterns. they are also a concerning source of human antimicrobial resistance. in this study fecal cultures were obtained from 15 may 2004 to 31 august 2004, from  21 free-living raptors and four captive raptors. enterococcus was isolated from 21 (84%) of the 25 birds, and 54 isolates were chosen for further study based upon unique colony morphology. the most common isolate recovered was enterococcus faecalis (95%, 95% confidence interval [ci]: 89-100). one bird in the study was determined to have enterococcus gallinarum. two distinct ribotypes of e. faecalis were identified, one with unique bands at 11 and 13 kb and the other with unique  bands at 14 and 20 kb. both ribotypes were found in free-living and captive birds. the enterococcus isolates in this study demonstrated a variety of antimicrobial-resistance characteristics, including almost complete resistance to amikacin, first-generation cephalosporins, spectinomycin, and sulphadimethoxime.  isolates demonstrated variable resistance to chloramphenicol, gentamicin, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, and ticarcillin. no phenotypically vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis isolates were recovered from any of the raptors; three isolates had intermediate level susceptibility. a significantly higher number of isolates collected from captive birds demonstrated resistance to chloramphenicol than those obtained from free-living birds. this trend was not duplicated with any of the remaining 18 antimicrobial drugs tested. the results of this study suggest that raptors in central illinois are coming into contact with antimicrobials, prey exposed to antimicrobials, or bacteria that are capable of transferring resistance genes. further study is needed to determine the source of antimicrobial-resistant enterococcus in free-living raptors but the limited data reflecting few differences between birds with and without antimicrobial exposure suggests that treatment and release of treated wild raptors is not contributing significantly to antimicrobial resistance in the environment.

TI  == vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. in marine environments from the west coast of the usa.
AB  == aims: the aim of the study was to determine if vancomycin-resistant enterococcus  spp. [vre] carrying vana and/or vanb genes were present in public marine beaches  and a fishing pier [2001-2003, 2008] from washington and california [2008]. methods: pcr assays for the vana and/or vanb genes with verification by dna-dna hybridization of the pcr products were used. positive isolates were speciated using the bd bbl crystal identification and/or by sequencing the 16s ribosomal region. results: eighteen (8%) of 227 isolates including enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus casseliflavus/gallinarum and a staphylococcus  epidermidis carrying vana and/or vanb genes, from four of six washington and one  of two california sites, were identified. selected vre and the s. epidermidis were able to transfer their van genes to an e. faecalis recipient at frequencies  ranging from 1.9 x 10(-6) to 6.7 x 10(-9). conclusions: vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. was isolated from five of the seven sites suggesting that other north america public beaches could be the reservoirs for vre and should be assessed. significance & impact of the study: this is the first report of isolation and characterization of vre strains (and a vanb staphylococcus sp.) from north american environmental sources suggesting that public beaches may be a reservoir for possible transmission of vre to beach visitors.

TI  == enterococcus faecalis with the gelatinase phenotype regulated by the fsr operon and with biofilm-forming capacity are common in the agricultural environment.
AB  == the prevalence of gelatinase activity and biofilm formation among environmental enterococci was assessed. in total, 396 enterococcal isolates from swine and cattle faeces and house flies from a cattle farm were screened for gelatinase activity. the most prevalent phenotype on todd-hewitt agar with 1.5% skim milk was the weak protease (wp) (72.2% of isolates), followed by the strong protease (sp) 18.7%, and no protease (np) (9.1%). the majority of wp isolates was represented by enterococcus hirae (56.9%), followed by enterococcus faecium (25.9%), enterococcus casseliflavus (10.4%), enterococcus gallinarum (5.2%) and enterococcus saccharolyticus (1.7%). all wp isolates were negative for gele (gelatinase) and spre (serine protease) as well as the fsrabdc operon that regulates the two proteases, and only four isolates (7.0%) formed biofilms in vitro. all sp isolates were enterococcus faecalis positive for the fsrabdc, gele, spre genes and the majority (91.2%) formed a biofilm. diversity of np isolates was relatively evenly distributed among e. hirae, e. faecium, e. casseliflavus, e. gallinarum, enterococcus durans, e. saccharolyticus and enterococcus mundtii.  all np isolates were negative for the fsr operon and only four e. hirae (11.1%) formed a biofilm. of further interest was the loss of the gelatinase phenotype (18.9% of isolates) from sp isolates after 4 month storage at 4-8 degrees c and several passages of subculture. results of reverse transcription pcr analysis indicated that mrna was produced for all the genes in the frs operon and sequencing of the gele gene did not reveal any significant mutations. however, gelatinase was not detectable by western blot analysis. our study shows that e. faecalis with the complete fsr operon and the potential to form a biofilm are relatively common in the agricultural environment and may represent a source/reservoir of clinically relevant strains. in addition, many environmental  enterococci, especially e. hirae, produce an unknown wp that can hydrolyse casein but does not contribute to biofilm formation. the stability of the gelatinase phenotype in e. faecalis and its regulation will require additional studies.

TI  == the homogeneity of vanb gene cluster among enterococcal isolates in iran.
AB  == aims: this study aimed to analyse the diversity of the vanb gene cluster in enterococcal species isolated from sewage treatment plants (stp) in tehran, iran. methods and results: the enterococcal isolates were collected from three sewage treatment plants in tehran, iran, during 2005. a total of 203 enterococcal isolates, collected over six rounds of sampling from three stps were tested for the presence of vanb gene. long-pcr showed that amongst the isolates, three enterococcus faecium, one enterococcus gallinarum and one enterococcus casseliflavus harboured the complete vanb gene cluster. restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) of the vanb1 gene cluster (5900 bp) from the isolates  showed an identical pattern to a standard strain of enterococcus faecalis (v583). none of the isolates were able to transfer the vanb gene in conjugation experiments. different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns were obtained for the three e. faecium isolates with vanb gene clusters. conclusions: our results indicated that the dissemination of vanb is not widespread in tehran. although only a few vanb positive isolates were detected, vanb was found in several enterococcal species. significance and impact of the study: in view of the lack of information on vanb resistance genes and their diversity in iran, knowledge of the global dissemination of vanb genes in enterococcus spp. is noteworthy.

TI  == identification and tracing of enterococcus spp. by rapd-pcr in traditional fermented sausages and meat environment.
AB  == aims: four local small-scale factories were studied to determine the sources of enterococci in traditional fermented sausages. methods and results: different points during the production of a traditional fermented sausage type (fuet) were  evaluated. randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr was used to type 596 enterococcus isolates from the final products, the initial meat batter, the casing, the workers' hands and the equipment. species-specific pcr-multiplex and  the partial sequencing of atpa gene and 16s rrna gene sequencing allowed the identification of the isolates: enterococcus faecalis (31.4%), enterococcus faecium (30.7%), enterococcus sanguinicola (14.9%), enterococcus devriesei (9.7%), enterococcus malodoratus (7.2%), enterococcus gilvus (1.0%), enterococcus gallinarum (1.3%), enterococcus casseliflavus (3.4%), enterococcus hermanniensis  (0.2%), and enterococcus durans (0.2%). a total of 92 different rapd-pcr profiles were distributed among the different factories and samples evaluated. most of the genotypes found in fuet samples were traced back to their source. conclusions: the major sources of enterococci in the traditional fermented sausages studied were mainly the equipment followed by the raw ingredients, although a low proportion was traced back to human origin. significance and impact of the study: this work contributes to determine the source of enterococcal contamination in fermented sausages and also to the knowledge of the meat environment.

TI  == nosocomial outbreak of enteroccocus gallinarum: untaming of rare species of enterococci.
AB  == an unusual increase in infections caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococcus gallinarum (vreg) was identified in may 2004, in a colombian tertiary care teaching hospital. a case-control study was subsequently designed to identify risk factors associated with the development of infections due to these organisms. all vreg isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, vancomycin resistance gene detection and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) typing. additionally, the presence of genes associated with an acquired pathogenicity island of e. faecalis and a hyl-like gene of e. faecium was assessed by hybridisation assays. eleven cases of vreg were identified between may through june 2004. vreg was isolated from blood (n=4), surgical secretions (n=4), paranasal sinus secretion (n=1), lung abscess (n=1) and urine (n=1). infections with vreg were associated with mucositis, hospitalisation in the haematology ward and surgical unit, length of hospital stay prior to culture and invasive procedures within 30 days prior to the culture. logistic regression found that female sex and hospitalisation in the surgical unit were independent factors for vreg infection. all isolates were identified as e. gallinarum, harboured the vanc1 gene and exhibited indistinguishable restriction patterns by pfge. virulence-associated genes were not detected. this is the first documented hospital-wide outbreak of vreg and highlights the fact that uncommon species of enterococci are capable of nosocomial dissemination.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria in two flemish artisan raw milk gouda-type cheeses.
AB  == pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) was used to study the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in two flemish artisan raw milk gouda-type cheeses. in parallel, conventional culturing was performed. isolates were identified using (gtg)(5)-pcr and sequence analysis of 16s rrna and phes genes. discriminant analysis revealed some differences in overall lab diversity between the two batches and between the two cheeses. within each batch, the diversity of 8- and 12-week-old cheeses was relatively similar. conventional isolation mainly revealed the presence of lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus  plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus rhamnosus and pediococcus pentosaceus. pcr-dgge revealed the presence of three species of which no isolates were recovered, i.e. enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus parabuchneri and lactobacillus gallinarum. conversely, not all isolated bacteria were detected by  pcr-dgge. we recommend the integrated use of culture-dependent and -independent approaches to maximally encompass the taxonomic spectrum of lab occurring in gouda-type and other cheeses.

TI  == prevalence and characterization of enterococcus spp. isolated from brazilian foods.
AB  == enterococci can be used in the food industry as starter or probiotic cultures. however, enterococci are also implicated in severe multi-resistant nosocomial infections. in this study, the prevalence of enterococci in selected brazilian foodstuffs (raw and pasteurized milk, meat products, cheeses and vegetables) was  evaluated. phenotypic and pcr protocols were used for species identification. tests for production of gelatinase, haemolysin, bacteriocin and bile salt hydrolysis were done with all enterococci isolates, whereas molecular determination of virulence markers (genes esp, gel, ace, as, efaa, hyl and cyla)  and antibiotic resistance was checked only for enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis isolates. the antibiotic-resistant isolates were assayed for biofilm formation and adhesion to mammalian cells. from the 120 food samples  analyzed, 52.5% were positive for enterococci, meat and cheese being the most contaminated. e. faecium was the predominant species, followed by e. faecalis, e. casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum. phenotypic tests indicated that 67.7%  of isolates hydrolyzed bile salts, 15.2% produced bacteriocin, 12.0% were beta-hemolytic and 18.2% produced gelatinase. antibiotic resistance (gentamicin,  tetracycline and erythromycin) and genes encoding for virulence traits were more  frequent in e. faecalis than in e. faecium. three e. faecium isolates were resistant to vancomycin. among antibiotic-resistant isolates, 72.4% of e. faecalis were able to form biofilm and 13.8% to adhere to caco-2 cells. antibiotic-resistant e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates were grouped by rapd-pcr and a scattered distribution was noted, indicating that resistance was not related to a particular clone. the spread of virulence/resistance traits in isolates of the two species and different rapd-types suggest the pathogenic potential of both species. by contrast, the recovery of bacteriocinogenic e. faecium isolates with no virulence traits suggests their potential for biotechnological applications. in conclusion, our results showed that enterococci from brazilian foods present important dualist aspects for food safety.

TI  == potential of houseflies to contaminate ready-to-eat food with antibiotic-resistant enterococci.
AB  == it was shown previously that houseflies in fast-food restaurants commonly carry antibiotic-resistant and potentially virulent enterococci. in this study, the potential of field-collected houseflies to contaminate ready-to-eat (rte) food with enterococci was assessed by laboratory bioassays. houseflies were collected  with a sweep net in a cattle feedlot and exposed in groups of 5, 10, 20, and 40 to a beef patty (from an rte hamburger) for 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, and 24 h. the exposure of rte food to flies resulted in 100% contamination with enterococci in all bioassays, regardless of the number of houseflies and the length of exposure time. in addition, with the increasing number of houseflies as well as with the increasing time exposure, the concentration of enterococci in rte food increased. even a short time exposure (0.5 h) resulted in food contamination, ranging from 3.1 x 10(3) cfu/g (5 houseflies) to 8.4 x 10(4) cfu/g (40 houseflies). the analysis of 23 randomly selected enterococcal isolates from rte food after the fly exposure revealed a single species, enterococcus faecalis. in contrast, four  enterococcus species, including e. faecalis (57.1%), e. gallinarum (19.1%), e. hirae (14.3%), and e. faecium (9.5%), represented 21 randomly selected and identified isolates from houseflies. phenotypic screening showed that e. faecalis isolates from rte food were resistant to ciprofloxacin (17.4%), tetracycline (13.0%), erythromycin (13.0%), and chloramphenicol (4.3%). this study demonstrates a great potential of houseflies from a cattle feedlot to contaminate rte food with enterococci in a short time.

TI  == a "retrocidal" plasmid in enterococcus faecalis: passage and protection.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis mc4 harbors a 130 kb conjugative, pheromone (ccf10)-responding plasmid, pams1, conferring chloramphenicol, streptomycin and tetracycline resistances. a plasmid-borne class iia bacteriocin (mc4-1) determinant and cognate immunity gene were present, but not expressed in mc4. however, pams1 transfer to e. faecalis jh2-2 (but not to the non-isogenic og1ss)  generated the surprising ability to express bacteriocin activity against the plasmid donor, mc4. the bacteriocin target spectrum includes e. faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus hirae, and listeria monocytogenes. those donors unable to express bacteriocin or immunity could protect themselves from the "retrocidal" behavior of transconjugants by a switch  to bacteriocin resistance at a frequency of approximately 10(-3). reversion to sensitivity occurred at a relatively high frequency, suggestive of involvement of a phase variation event. these observations concerning a conjugative plasmid with novel "retrocidal" properties, coupled with a defense mechanism independent of plasmid-borne immunity functions, may relate to phenomena exploiting regulatory features with broader ecological and evolutionary implications.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility and distribution of antimicrobial-resistance genes among enterococcus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus isolates recovered from  poultry litter.
AB  == data on the prevalence of antimicrobial resistant enterococci and staphylococci from the poultry production environment are sparse in the united states. this information is needed for science-based risk assessments of antimicrobial use in  animal husbandry and potential public-health consequences. in this study, we assessed the susceptibility of staphylococci and enterococci isolated from poultry litter, recovered from 24 farms across georgia, to several antimicrobials of veterinary and human health importance. among the 90 enterococcus isolates recovered, e. hirae (46%) was the most frequently encountered species, followed by e. faecium (27%), e. gallinarum (12%), and e. faecalis (10%). antimicrobial resistance was most often observed to tetracycline (96%), followed by clindamycin (90%), quinupristin-dalfopristin (62%), penicillin (53%), erythromycin (50%), nitrofurantoin (49%), and clarithromycin (48%). among the 110 staphylococci isolates recovered, only coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) were identified with the predominant staphylococcus species being s. sciuri (38%), s. lentus (21%), s. xylosus (14%) and s. simulans (12%). resistance was less-frequently observed among the staphylococcus isolates for the majority of antimicrobials tested, as compared with enterococcus isolates, and was primarily limited to clarithromycin (71%), erythromycin (71%), clindamycin (48%), and tetracycline (38%). multidrug resistance (mdr) phenotypes were prevalent in both enterococcus  and staphylococcus; however, enterococcus exhibited a statistically significant difference in the median number of antimicrobials to which resistance was observed (median = 5.0) compared with staphylococcus species (median = 3.0). because resistance to several of these antimicrobials in gram-positive bacteria may be attributed to the shuttling of common drug-resistance genes, we also determined which common antimicrobial-resistance genes were present in both enterococci and staphylococci. the antimicrobial resistance genes vat(d) and erm(b) were present in enterococci, vgab in staphylococci, and mobile genetic elements tn916 and pheromone-inducible plasmids were only identified in enterococci. these data suggest that the disparity in antimicrobial-resistance phenotypes and genotypes between enterococci and staphylococci isolated from the  same environment is, in part, because of barriers preventing exchange of mobile dna elements.

TI  == comparative analysis of genetic diversity and incidence of virulence factors and  antibiotic resistance among enterococcal populations from raw fruit and vegetable foods, water and soil, and clinical samples.
AB  == a comparative study was carried out among enterococci isolated from fruits and vegetable foods, water and soil, and clinical samples. results indicate strong differences in the numbers of enterococcal species found in different environments as well as their abundance. while enterococcus faecalis was clearly  the predominant species in clinical samples, enterococcus faecium predominated in vegetables, and it slightly outnumbered e. faecalis in water samples. other species (enterococcus hirae, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus durans, enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus) were found more frequently in vegetables, water, and specially in soil. isolates from vegetable foods showed a lower incidence of antibiotic resistance compared to clinical isolates for most antimicrobials tested, especially erythromycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gentamicin and streptomycin for e.  faecalis, and quinupristin/dalfopristin, ampicillin, penicillin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, rifampicin, choramphenicol, gentamicin and nitrofurantoin for e. faecium. e. faecium isolates from vegetable foods and water showed an average lower number of antibiotic resistance traits (2.95 and 3.09 traits for vegetable  and water isolates, respectively) compared to clinical samples (7.5 traits). multi-resistant strains were also frequent among clinical e. faecalis isolates (5.46 traits on average). none of e. faecalis or e. faecium isolates from vegetable foods, water and soil showed beta-haemolytic activity, while 25.64% of  clinical e. faecalis did. a 51.28% of e. faecalis clinical isolates tested positive for the cyla, cylb, cylm set of genes, while some or all of these genes  were missing in the rest of isolates. in clinical e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates, the genetic determinants for the enterococcal surface protein gene (esp), the collagen adhesin gene (ace) and the sex pheromone gene ccf (as well as cob in e. faecalis) showed a clearly higher incidence compared to isolates from other sources. e. faecalis isolates from vegetable foods and water had much lower average numbers of virulence genetic determinants per strain (4.23 and 4.0, respectively) compared to clinical isolates (8.71). similarly, among e. faecium the lowest average number of traits per strain occurred in vegetable food isolates (1.72) followed by water (3.9) and clinical isolates (4.73). length heterogeneity (lh)-pcr typing with espf-acef-ccff and espf-ccff primers revealed  genomic groups that clearly differentiated clinical isolates from those of vegetable foods, water and soil (except for two clinical isolates). the large differences found in the incidence of antibiotic resistance and virulence factors and in the genetic fingerprints determined by lh-pcr suggest a clear separation of hospital-adapted populations of enterococci from those found in open environments.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance profiles of enterococci isolated from poultry meat and pasteurized milk in rio de janeiro, brazil.
AB  == the enterococci are important nosocomial pathogens with a remarkable capacity of  expressing resistance to several antimicrobial agents. their ubiquitous nature and resistance to adverse environmental conditions take account for their ability to colonize different habitats and for their potential for easy spreading through the food chain. in the present study we evaluated the distribution of species and antimicrobial susceptibility among enterococcal isolates recovered from food obtained in retail stores in rio de janeiro, brazil. the following species were identified among 167 isolates obtained from poultry meat and 127 from pasteurized milk: enterococcus faecalis (62.6%), e. casseliflavus (17.3%), e. durans (6.5%),  e. gallinarum (3.0%), e. gilvus (2.4%), e. faecium (2.0%), e. hirae (1.4%), and e. sulfureus (1.0%). the overall percentages of antimicrobial resistant isolates  were: 31.2 % to tetracycline, 23.8% to erythromycin, 11.3% to streptomycin, 4.3%  to chloramphenicol, 3.9% to gentamicin, 1.4% to norfloxacin, 1.1% to imipenem, 0.7% to ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, and penicillin, and 0.4% to ampicillin. intermediate resistance was detected in frequencies varying from 0.5% for linezolid to 58.2% for erythromycin. none of the isolates showed resistance to glycopeptides. high-level resistance to aminoglycosides was observed in 13.1% of  the isolates. multiresistance was observed in e. faecalis, e. casseliflavus, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. durans and e. gilvus.

AB  == the aim of the work was the evaluation of different pcr-based methods to found an appropriate identification and typing strategy for environmental enterococci. environmental enterococci were isolated mainly from surface- and waste-waters. species identification was provided by combination of phenotypic (micronaut system, merlin) and molecular detection methods (fluorescent its-pcr, ddl-pcr, rep-pcr, aflp). very similar results were observed among molecular methods, however several discrepancies were recognized during comparison of molecular and  biochemical identification. seven enterococcal species (e. faecium, e. hirae, e.  casseliflavus, e. mundtii, e. faecalis, e. durans and e. gallinarum) were identified within 166 environmental isolates. the results obtained in this work attest the importance of pcr-based methods for identification and typing of environmental enterococci. the fluorescent its-pcr (fits-pcr) showed the best results in order to identify the enterococci strains, the method used the automated capillary electrophoresis to separate the pcr products in a very rapid  and precise way. the aflp method was suitable to identify and characterize the isolates, while the rep-pcr can be used for species identification.

TI  == [a 6-year study of glycopeptides-resistant enterococci in 3 intensive care units  of the university hospital of montpellier].
AB  == aim of the study: the aim of this study was to evaluate the rate of glycopeptides-resistant enterococci (gre) fecal carriage (species and resistance  determinants). strains isolated between 1999 and 2005 during systematic screening for multiresistant bacteria in patients hospitalized in 3 intensive care units (icu) of the university hospital of montpellier were studied. methods: the systematic screening was weekly performed. rectal swabs were cultured on d-coccosel agar medium containing 4 mg/l vancomycin and mics for vancomycin and teicoplanin were determined by e-test. strains were subjected to both phenotypic  and genotypic identification and vana, vanb and vanc genes were detected by pcr.  results: we analyzed 13003 samples for 5113 patients. among them, 401 (7.84%) patients were gre carriers with 280 enterococcus gallinarum (vanc(1)), 102 enterococcus casseliflavus-flavescens (vanc(2)-c(3)), 5 enterococcus faecalis (3  vana, 2 vanb), and 14 enterococcus faecium (10 vana, 4 vanb). a unique case of cross contamination between two patients was observed. during the same time, only one strain of gre was isolated during an infectious process in another unit. carriage rate of e. faecium and e. faecalis vana or vanb was 0.37%: 68.4, 21 and  10.6% in the gastrointestinal, in the polyvalent and the respiratory icu, respectively. conclusion: our results were in agreement with national data showing a relatively low gre fecal carriage rate in icus, e. faecium vana being the mainly encountered gre. since 2004, gre detection is increasingly reported in france and an emerging e. faecium vana clone has been identified during outbreaks. in contrast, only one e. faecium vanb strain has been isolated in our  institution since this date and a unique strain of e. faecalis vana was isolated  during an infectious process since 1999. these data underlined the efficacy of transmission prevention measures established when gre are identified.

TI  == assessment of safety of enterococci isolated throughout traditional terrincho cheesemaking: virulence factors and antibiotic susceptibility.
AB  == enterococci account for an important fraction of the adventitious microflora of traditional cheeses manufactured in mediterranean countries from small ruminants' raw milk and play an important role in the development of suitable organoleptic characteristics of the final product. it has been suggested that animals used for food or animals that supply edible products are a reservoir of antibiotic-resistant enterococci. the main purpose of this research effort was thus to identify, to the species level, a total of 73 enterococci with high tolerance to acidic ph and bile salts (as prevailing environmental conditions in  the first portion of the gastrointestinal tract), which were previously isolated  from the milk feedstock to the final product of terrincho cheesemaking, and to determine their profiles of antibiotic susceptibility, coupled with the occurrence of specific virulence factors (especially in those that might eventually be claimed to exhibit suitable probiotic and technological performances). isolates, identified by both api 20 strep and pcr methods, were found to belong to the following enterococcus species: e. casseliflavus, e. durans, e. faecalis, e. faecium, and e. gallinarum. susceptibility of those isolates was observed to most antibiotics tested, whereas none harbored aminoglycoside resistance genes. pcr screenings for cytolysin genes (cyll(l), cyll(s), cylm, cylb, and cyla), surface adhesin genes (efaa(fs), efaa(fm), and esp), the aggregation protein gene (agg), and the extracellular metalloendopeptidase gene (gele) were performed. all isolates proved negative for cyll(l), cylm, cylb, and agg genes. both e. faecalis strains were positive for the cell wall-associated protein esp and the cell wall adhesin efaa(fs), whereas  the cell wall adhesin efaa(fm) was detected in 11 of the 12 e. faecium strains. only one strain possessed the cyll(s) determinant, and another possessed the cyla gene. incidence of virulence determinants was thus very low; hence, the enterococcal adventitious microflora tested is essentially safe.

TI  == high prevalence of tetracycline resistance in enterococcus isolates from broilers carrying the erm(b) gene.
AB  == a total of 73 isolates of enterococcus spp. carrying the erm(b) gene were obtained from cloacal swabs of broiler chickens derived from 13 different farms in belgium. the erm(b) gene encodes resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin b antibiotics (mls(b)). the isolates belonged to eight different species: enterococcus avium (eight isolates), enterococcus casseliflavus (11 isolates), enterococcus cecorum (eight isolates), enterococcus durans (seven isolates), enterococcus faecalis (10 isolates), enterococcus faecium (17 isolates), enterococcus gallinarum (seven isolates) and enterococcus hirae (five  isolates). acquired resistance to tetracycline was detected in 68 of the isolates, and in 62 of these it was associated with the presence of the resistance genes tet(l), tet(m), tet(o) or tet(s). in three e. faecium isolates that were phenotypically susceptible to tetracycline, tet(l) or tet(m) was present. the transposon integrase gene (int gene) of the tn916/tn1545 transposon  family was detected in 18 of the 54 isolates that contained the tet(m) gene. it was concluded that acquired resistance to tetracycline antibiotics is often present in enterococci from poultry carrying the erm(b) gene. the use of tetracyclines in poultry may therefore co-select for resistance to mls(b) antibiotics, which may be important as alternative therapy for enterococcal infections in humans.

TI  == gram-positive bloodstream infections in liver transplant recipients: incidence, risk factors, and impact on survival.
AB  == the objective of the study was to assess the incidence, risk factors, and survival of gram-positive bloodstream infections (gp-bsi(s)) among liver transplant recipients during the first year after transplantation. between october 2000 and september 2006, 42 episodes of gp-bsi(s) occurred in 205 patients with an overall incidence of 0.20 episodes/patient. coagulase-negative staphylococci were detected in 45.2% of cases, enterococcus species in 42.9% (e faecalis, eight; e faecium, seven; e avium, two; e gallinarum, one) and staphylococcus aureus in 11.9%. retransplantation was the only independent risk factor for gp-bsi (odds ratio [or], 0.253; 95% confidence interval (ci), 0.089 to 0.715; p = .009). thirty-day mortality rate was 28.5% and s aureus infections were related to a poorer outcome. it is noteworthy that all the isolates of s aureus were methicillin-resistant. ampicillin was inactive against all the strains of e faecium and 50% of e avium isolates, but active against all e faecalis and e gallinarum strains. all the isolates were glycopeptide-susceptible. no significant differences in mortality rate were observed in relation to sex, etiologies of end-stage liver disease, cytomegalovirus infection/reinfection, type of donor, rejection, or retransplantation. gp-bsi, the only independent risk factor for death (or, 0.262; 95% ci, 0.106 to 0.643; p = .003), reduced the survival rate by 26% in the first  year posttransplant. in conclusion, gp-bsi(s) impact significantly on morbidity and mortality posttransplant, particularly among retransplantations. control measures are required to reduce the incidence of gp-bsi(s) in liver transplant recipients. these findings must be considered when empirical antimicrobial therapy is indicated while awaiting blood-culture results.

TI  == [vancomycin and high-level aminoglycoside resistant enterococcus carriage and the risk factors related to resistance in hospitalized patients].
AB  == the aims of this study were to detect the prevalence of fecal vancomycin resistant enterococcus (vre) colonization with high-level resistance to aminoglycoside and other antibiotics and, the risk factors related to resistance  in hospitalized patients in duzce medical faculty hospital, turkey. a total of 105 patients (61 from internal medicine, 44 from surgery clinics; 54.3% female, mean age: 47.2 +/- 24.54 years) were included to the study and a single stool sample was collected from each of the patients. specimens were cultivated in enterococcus selective media (biomerieux, france), and the isolates were identified by conventional microbiological methods together with the api 20 strep test. beta-lactamase activities of the isolates were tested with nitrocefin disk, and antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by the disk diffusion method. enterococcus spp. were isolated from 81 (77%) of the patients' samples and 60.5%  were identified as e. faecium, 13.6% as e. faecalis, 11.1% as e. gallinarum, 7.4% as e. durans, 2.5% as e. raffinosus, 2.5% as e. mundtii, 1.2% as e. casseliflavus, and 1.2% as e. avium. high-level streptomycin and gentamicin resistance rates were found in 19.8% and 9.9% of the isolates, respectively. the  resistance rates for the other antibiotics were found as follows; 18.5% to ampicillin, 27.2% to penicilin, 34.6% to nitrofurantoin, 65.4% to norfloxacin, and 70.4% to both tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. no vancomycin resistance was detected, and none of the enterococci had beta-lactamase activity. long hospitalization period, antibiotic usage and experience of intra-abdominal operation were found as the significant risk factors for colonization of the resistant bacteria. our results demonstrated that there was no fecal vre carriage in our hospital during the study period, however, it was concluded that the screening tests should be done periodically in order to detect resistant strains  as soon as possible.

TI  == prevalence, identification and distribution of various species of enterococci isolated from clinical specimens with special reference to urinary tract infection in catheterized patients.
AB  == various clinical specimens were processed to find the prevalence rate of enterococci and to identify the species of clinical isolates of enterococci. screening of various clinical specimens revealed that enterococci were prevalent  in 22.19% of the total specimens, with foley's catheters and burn wounds to be the major site of isolation. high rate of colonization was noted as opposed to infection. conventional test scheme proposed by facklam and collins were successfully used to speciate enterococcal strains. seven species of enterococci  were identified in the study from a set of 202 cultures, with e.faecalis (49.50%) and e. faecium (35.64%) predominating. e. avium (9.40%), e. hirae (2.47%), e. raffinosus (1.98%) and one isolate each of e.gallinarum and e. casseliflavus were the other members of enterococcus species identified. urinary tract infection (uti) by enterococci due to catherisation was found in 8.92% of the patients and  is probably the result of high rate of colonization of foley's catheters and use  of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

TI  == epidemiology and molecular characterization of vancomycin resistant enterococci isolates in india.
AB  == little attention has been paid to the problem of the spread of vancomycin resistant enterococci (vre) in india. between august 2002 to march 2003, faecal and urine samples of patients from various wards of the postgraduate institute of medical education and research, chandigarh, india, were screened for vancomycin resistance. 36 vre were isolated (18 enterococcus gallinarum, 9 e. casseliflavus, 7 e. faecium and 2 e. faecalis). these isolates were characterized as low-, moderate- and high-level resistant strains by phenotypic as well as genotypic methods such as minimum inhibitory concentration determination, polymerase chain  reaction assays, sequencing of pcr products and multiple sequence alignment of van genes. correlations established between these results and the vancomycin resistance markers were designated as vana (783 bp), vanb (635 bp), vanc1 (822 bp) and vanc2 (484 bp) according to the findings of earlier workers as well as comparison with existing databases. prolonged hospital stay and vancomycin were important risk factors for both vre uti and colonization. renal dialysis, renal failure, prior aminoglycoside and third generation cephalosporin were the other significant factors for vre uti. the study also highlights the importance of screening for vre in clinical samples and recommends the institution of control measures to prevent the further spread of vre.

TI  == molecular identification and diversity of enterococci isolated from slovak bryndza cheese.
AB  == three hundred and eight presumed enterococcal isolates were recovered from bryndza, a soft sheep milk cheese. the cheese samples were obtained from five different commercial distributors in slovakia and were taken at three different seasonal intervals. all isolates were identified to the species level using genotypic tools. species-specific pcr using ddl genes highlighted the predominance of enterococcus faecium (176 isolates) and assigned 50 isolates to the species enterococcus faecalis. the remaining 82 isolates were classified using repetitive element sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with primer (gtg)(5)-(gtg)(5)-pcr, in combination with phenylalanyl-trna synthase gene (phes) sequence analysis and by whole-cell protein analysis (sds-page). these strains were identified as enterococcus durans (59 strains), enterococcus italicus (8 strains), enterococcus casseliflavus (3 strains), enterococcus gallinarum (3 strains), enterococcus hirae (1 strain), and 8 strains were members of the species lactococcus lactis. of the seven enterococcal species isolated, three of them, e. durans, e. faecalis and e. faecium were present in all samples  studied, with e. faecium as the predominant one. the precise identification of enterococci in bryndza cheese is an essential step in the process of evaluation of their functional properties which will be further studied and assessed.

AB  == the phoenix system (becton dickinson diagnostic systems, sparks, md) was evaluated for identification (id) to the species level of streptococci and enterococci. two hundred clinical isolates were investigated: beta-hemolytic streptococci (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae organisms (n = 46), viridans group streptococci (n = 31), enterococcus faecium (n = 36), enterococcus faecalis (n = 25), and other catalase-negative cocci (n = 12). the api system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) was used as a comparator. molecular methods (sequencing of 16s rrna and zwf and gki genes and ddl gene amplification) were used to investigate discordant results. upon resolution of discrepancies, correct species id was achieved by the phoenix system for 121/129 (93.8%) streptococci and 63/70  (90.0%) enterococci. excellent results were obtained for s. pneumoniae (45/45) and beta-hemolytic streptococci (49/50). with regard to viridans streptococci, the accuracy of the phoenix system was 83.9%. among the latter organisms, the best performance was obtained with isolates of the streptococcus sanguinis group  and streptococcus anginosus group; problems were instead encountered with the streptococcus mitis group. four e. faecium and three e. faecalis isolates were misidentified as enterococcus casseliflavus/enterococcus gallinarum or enterococcus durans. thus, these isolates were identified only at the genus level. compared with commercially available systems, the phoenix system appears a reliable diagnostic tool for identifying clinically relevant streptococci and enterococci. the smic/id-2 panel proved particularly effective for beta-hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci.

TI  == assessment of two commercial susceptibility test methods for determination of daptomycin mics.
AB  == daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic with activity against several important gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including drug-resistant staphylococci and enterococci. because the mechanism of action of daptomycin is calcium-dependent depolarization of the cell membrane, susceptibility testing requires medium supplemented with a physiological level of calcium. this study assessed two food  and drug administration-cleared commercial test devices for determination of daptomycin mics, etest and justone. a collection of 220 selected isolates, including staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, e. avium, e. durans, e. casseliflavus, and e. gallinarum, were tested by both methods. included in the collection were 22 s. aureus and 14  enterococcus sp. isolates that were recovered from patients and were nonsusceptible on the basis of the daptomycin mics. as the reference method for comparison, all isolates were tested by the clinical and laboratory standards institute broth microdilution method incorporating cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth with 50 microg/ml calcium. daptomycin mics agreed, within 1 twofold dilution, for 97% of the isolates by etest and for 100% by justone. however, daptomycin mics determined by etest were 1 dilution lower than the reference mics for 65% of the enterococcus sp. isolates tested. this resulted in 28.5% very major (vm) errors (4/14) with enterococci (all e. faecium) but none (0/22) with staphylococci. use of justone yielded mics that were 1 dilution lower than the reference mics for 69% of the staphylococci and 25% of the enterococci. this resulted in 13.6% vm errors (3/22) with staphylococci and 14.3% vm errors (2/14)  with enterococci. the manufacturer-recommended justone inoculum preparation resulted in mean colony counts of only 5 x 10(4) to 1 x 10(5) cfu/ml in the wells of the strip. increasing the inoculum to 3 x 10(5) to 4 x 10(5) cfu/ml eliminated two of five vm errors upon retesting. no major interpretive errors occurred with  either device. in summary, daptomycin mics generated by the etest or justone method generally agreed within 1 dilution of the reference daptomycin mics. however, both devices produced slightly lower mics that resulted in some vm errors.

TI  == partial characterization of enterocin mr99 from a corn silage isolate of enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == aims: to assess the inhibitory activity on gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of several species of enterococci recovered from a natural corn silage.  methods and results: the inhibitory activity of strains of enterococcus faecalis  (58), enterococcus faecium (35), enterococcus gallinarum (3) and enterococcus casseliflavus (4) were studied employing indicator strains from various sources (clinical, food and atcc). enterococcus faecalis mr99, the only strain with inhibitory activity, inhibited other enterococci, listeria spp., staphylococcus aureus, clostridium spp., bacillus spp., escherichia coli, shigella sonnei and shigella flexneri. the bacterium contained only one conjugative pheromone-responsive plasmid. the partially chromatography-purified mr99 enterocin (ppe) had a molecular weight of approx. 5000 da and a pi of 6.2, was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and could be extracted in benzene and butanol. it appeared stable to adjustment of ph 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0 and was resistant to heat. inactivation was at 15 min at 121 degrees c. enterocin mr99 was bactericidal on strains of listeria monocytogenes, staph. aureus, and bovine  mastitis agents, it was bacteriostatic on e. coli. although enterocins mr99 and as48 have inhibitory activity on gram-negative bacilli, pcr studies demonstrated  a lack of relationship between them. conclusions: the active component had a protein nature, was resistant to heat and presented a wide inhibitory spectrum. significance and impact of the study: the biological properties of ent. faecalis  mr99 suggest that this strain merits further investigations so it can be applied  in human and veterinary health programmes.

TI  == species prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococci isolated in a  tertiary care hospital of north india.
AB  == the present prospective study was carried out to determine the species distribution and antimicrobial susceptibilities of enterococci isolated from clinical samples in a tertiary care hospital of north india. enterococcus species isolated from blood, urine, pus, sterile fluids and the hospital environment from october 2003 to january 2004 were identified by standard biochemical tests. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the disk diffusion method as per nccls guidelines. out of a total of 105 enterococcus species recovered during the study period, e. faecium (42.90%) and e. faecalis (40.00%) constituted the predominant isolates. enterococcus faecium was the commonest blood culture isolate while e. faecalis predominated pus and urine samples. other species isolated were e. mundtii, e dispar, e. durans, e. avium, e. raffinosus and e. gallinarum. high-level aminoglycoside resistance was detected in 73.3% of isolates. resistance to vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid was not detected. prevalence of a wide variety of enterococcus species in clinical samples together with their variable antimicrobial susceptibility patterns emphasizes the need for routinely carrying out detailed speciation and in vitro susceptibility testing of enterococcal isolates in the clinical bacteriology laboratory.

TI  == effect of growth promotant usage on enterococci species on a poultry farm.
AB  == the species population of enterococci isolated from four poultry houses for six grow-outs on one farm was determined. two houses on the farm were control houses  and did not use any antimicrobials, while two other houses on the farm used flavomycin, virginiamycin, and bacitracin during different poultry grow-outs. litter, chick boxliners, feed, and poultry carcass rinses were obtained from each house and cultured for the presence of enterococci. nine species of enterococci (enterococcusfaecalis, e. faecium, e. avium, e. casselifiavus, e. cecorum, e. durans, e. gallinarum, e. hirae, and e. malodoratus) were identified from the study. enterococcus faecalis was isolated more frequently from chick boxliners (n=176; 92%) and carcass rinses (n=491; 69%), whereas e. faecium was found more frequently in litter (n=361; 77%) and feed (n=67; 64%). enterococcus faecalis (n=763; 52%) and e. faecium (n=578; 39%) were isolated most often from the farm and houses, regardless of antimicrobial treatment. fifty-two percent of e. faecalis and 39% of e. faecium were isolated from both control (n=389 and 295, respectively) and treatment (n=374 and 283, respectively) samples. this study indicates that antimicrobial usage on this farm did not alter the resident population of enterococci.

TI  == occurrence of antibiotic resistant enterococci in clinical specimens from a pediatric hospital.
AB  == enterococcal infection has become a major clinical problem and e. faecalis and e. faecium are the most frequently isolated species. however, the isolation of other species (e. casseliflavus, e. gallinarum, e. durans) from clinical materials was  reported recently. the aim of this study was to evaluate drug resistance of 97 species of enterococci isolated from clinical specimens of upper silesian health  center of child and mother in katowice. each strain was tested for susceptibility to vancomycin, teicoplanin, aminoglycosides (gentamycin and streptomycin) and synercid (quinupristine/ dalfopristine) by the e-test method. fifty three percent of studied enterococci demonstrated high level aminoglycoside resistance (hlar) (mic > 1024 microg/ml). sixty three strains of e. faecalis were sensitive to vancomycin (mic 1-4 microg/ml), but 5 strains demonstrated low sensitivity (3 strains with mic = 6 microg/ml and 2 strains with mic = 24 microg/ml). all studied enterococci were sensitive to teicoplanin (mic < 2 microg/ml). a high percentage of e. faecium (70%) resistant to synercid was demonstrated (mic = 2-24 microg/ml). infection control and monitoring of antibiotic sensitivity among isolated hospital strains may prevent the transmission of resistant strains in a  pediatric hospital.

AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate reliability of identification and determination of sensitivity to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics of some gram positive cocci strains in 34 sanitary-epidemiological stations. all laboratories  engaged in this study received 3 strains: s. aureus (s. aureus sc+ cf+, resistant to methicillin., or s. aureus sc - cf+, sensitive to methicillin), coagulase-negative staphylococci (s. epidermidis or s. haemolyticus or s. saprophyticus) and enterococcus sp. (e. faecalis hlar-positive or e. faecalis hlar-negative or e. faecium or e. gallinarum). all these strains previously were  identified in department of bacteriology of national institute of hygiene. of the 68 staphylococci strains tested, 66 isolates were correctly identified. among the 34 enterococcal strains studied the greatest difficulty in identification was caused by e. gallinarum strain--(8 out of 13 strains were incorrectly recognised). the determination of the sensitivity of the control strains to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents, generally was performed correctly in accordance with to the nccls and national recommendations. some incorrect results of the antibiograms were caused by an erroneous interpretation of the zones of inhibition.

TI  == contribution of enterococci to the spread of antibiotic resistance in the production chain of swine meat commodities.
AB  == thirty-six samples, including fecal specimens, dry feedstuffs, raw and processed  pork meat products, and dry fermented sausages, were collected from two production chains of swine meat commodities and analyzed for the presence of 11 antibiotic resistance (ar) genes. specific pcr assays carried out on dna extracted directly from the samples revealed a high incidence of the genes tet(k) (80.5%), ermb (66.7%), and tet(m) (66.7%). feces and feedstuffs gave the largest  number of positive amplifications. to elucidate the contribution of enterococci to the occurrence and spread of ar, 146 resistant enterococci were isolated, and  their identity, genetic fingerprints, and ar gene profiles were determined by means of molecular techniques. enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium were the predominant isolated species (43.8 and 38.4%, respectively); other enterococcus species identified were e. durans (8.9%), e. hirae (2.7%), e. gallinarum (2.1%), e. mundtii (2.1%), and e. casseliflavus (2.1%). a number of isolates displayed a complex ar gene profile comprising up to four different resistance determinants. the genes tet(m) and ermb were highly diffused, being present in 86.9 and 84.9%, respectively, of the isolates. the application of amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting was particularly valuable to monitor the resistant enterococcal isolates along the production chain and to  individuate steps in which contamination might occur. in fact, isolates of e. faecalis and e. faecium showing the same amplified fragment length polymorphism profile and ar gene pattern were detected in samples taken at different steps of  the food chain suggesting three cases of bacterial clonal spread.

TI  == genetic diversity and safety aspects of enterococci from slightly fermented sausages.
AB  == aims: to determine the biodiversity of enterococci from slightly fermented sausages (chorizo and fuet) at species and strain level by molecular typing, while considering their safety aspects. methods and results: species-specific pcr and partial sequencing of 16s rrna and soda genes were used to identify enterococcal population. enterococcus faecium was the most frequently isolated species followed by e. faecalis, e. hirae and e. durans. randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr revealed species-specific clusters and allowed strain  typing. sixty strains of 106 isolates exhibited different rapd profiles indicating a high genetic variability. all the e. faecalis strains carried virulence genes (efaafs, esp, agg and gele) and all e. faecium isolates carried efaafm gene. enterococcus faecalis showed higher antibiotic resistance than the other species. only one e. faecium strain showed vana genotype (high-level resistance to glycopeptides) and e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus/flavescens isolates showed vanc1 and vanc2/c3 genotypes (low-level resistance only to vancomycin) respectively. conclusions: e. faecalis has been mainly associated with virulence factors and antimicrobial multi-resistance and, although potential risk for human health is low, the presence of this species in slightly fermented  sausages should be avoided to obtain high quality products. significance and impact of the study: the enterococcal population of slightly fermented sausages has been thoroughly characterized. several relevant safety aspects have been revealed.

TI  == emergence of unusual species of enterococci causing infections, south india.
AB  == background: enterococci tend to be one of the leading causes of nosocomial infections, with e. faecalis and e. faecium accounting up to 90% of the clinical  isolates. nevertheless, the incidence of other species of enterococci from clinical sources shows an alarming increase with the properties of intrinsic resistance to several antibiotics including beta-lactams and glycopeptides. thus  proper identification of enterococci to species level is quintessential for management and prevention of these bacteria in any healthcare facility. hence this work was undertaken to study the prevalence of unusual species of enterococci causing human infections, in a tertiary care hospital in south india. methods: the study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in south india from  july 2001 to june 2003. isolates of enterococci were collected from various clinical specimens and speciated using extensive phenotypic and physiological tests. antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed and interpreted as per nccls guidelines. whole cell protein (wcp) fingerprinting of enterococci were done for species validation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) and analyzed computationally. results: our study showed the prevalence of unusual (non-faecalis and non-faecium enterococci) and atypical (biochemical variant) species of enterococci as 19% (46 isolates) and 5% (12 isolates) respectively. the 7 unusual species (46 isolates) isolated and confirmed by phenotypic characterization includes: 15 e. gallinarum (6.2%), 10 e. avium (4.1%), 6 e. raffinosus (2.5%), 6 e. hirae (2.5%), 4 e. mundtii (1.7%), 3 e. casseliflavus-including the two atypical isolates (1.2%) and 2 e. durans (0.8%). the 12 atypical enterococcal species (5%) that showed aberrant sugar reactions in conventional phenotyping were confirmed as e. faecalis, e. faecium and e. casseliflavus respectively by wcp fingerprinting. the antimicrobial susceptibility testing depicted the emergence of high-level aminoglycoside and beta-lactam resistance among different species apart from intrinsic vancomycin resistance by some species, while all the species tested were susceptible for linezolid and teicoplanin. conclusion: our study reveals the emergence of multi-drug resistance among unusual species of enterococci posing a serious therapeutic challenge. precise identification of enterococci to species level enables us to access the species-specific antimicrobial resistance characteristics, apart from knowing the epidemiological pattern and their clinical significance in human infections.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of enterococcus sp. isolated from the intestinal tract of patients from a university hospital in brazil.
AB  == this study reports the results about antimicrobial resistance of enterococcus spp. isolated from intestinal tract of patients from a university hospital in brazil. the identification of strains at species level was performed by conventional biochemical tests, api 20 strep (biomerieux), and polymerase chain reaction assay. the species distribution was e. faecium (34%), followed by e. faecalis (33%), e. gallinarum (23.7%), e. casseliflavus (5.2%), e. avium (1%), and e. hirae (1%). intrinsic resistance to vancomycin characterized by presence of vanc genes was found in e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus. the high prevalence of vanc phenotype enterococci is very important because these species  have been reported as causing a wide variety of infections. vancomycin-resistant  e. faecium or e. faecalis were not found and no one isolate of these species was  a beta-lactamase producer. thirteen clinical isolates of enterococci (13.4%) showed multiresistance patterns, which were defined by resistance to three classes of antibiotics plus resistance to at least one aminoglycoside (gentamicin and/or streptomycin). the resistance to several antimicrobials shown by enterococcal strains obtained in this study is of concern because of the decrease in the therapeutic options for treatment of infections caused by enterococci.

AB  == thirty multidrug-resistant enterococcus spp. strains, including two from the milk of cows with mastitis, nine from chicken litter and 19 from turkey litter, were isolated. twenty-five were identified by biochemical methods as e. gallinarum and five as e. faecalis. most of the isolates were resistant to vancomycin, gentamicin, streptomycin, tetracycline, erythromycin, bacitracin, kanamycin and nalidixic acid but sensitive to ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, ampicillin and ofloxacin. attempts were made by partial amplification of the gene sequences to detect the vancomycin resistance markers vana (734-bp), vanb (420-bp), vanc1 (531-bp), and vanc2-c3 (673-bp); virulence markers cyla (427-bp)  and cylb (225-bp) for enterococcal cytolysin and a biofilm-forming surface protein (esp). individual and multiplex-pcr assays for vancomycin resistance markers revealed the vanc1 gene in 22 e. gallinarum strains. none of the remaining isolates including five e. faecalis strains (mic=2 microg ml(-1)) and three e. gallinarum strains (mic=8 microg ml(-1)) had any of the van genes tested. analysis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and a comparison of smai banding profiles showed 11 different patterns. probing with a dig-labeled vanc1 pcr product indicated a common 38.0 kb smai dna fragment in all the e. gallinarum strains harboring the vanc1 gene. the genes cyla and cylb were detected only in one clinical e. gallinarum isolate and two quality control clinical strains of e. faecalis (atcc 51299 and 29212). none of the virulence factors were found in milk or poultry isolates. intermediate level resistance to  vancomycin in enterococci from the us animal farms was predominantly due to the presence of vanc1 gene.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant enterococcus species by direct sequencing of groes and spacer region.
AB  == we determined the groesl sequences (groes, groel, and the intergenic spacer) of 10 clinically relevant enterococcus species and evaluated the feasibility of identifying enterococcus species on the basis of these sequences. seven common clinical enterococcus species, e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. casseliflavus, e. gallinarum, e. avium, e. raffinosus, and e. hirae, and three less common enterococcus species, e. cecorum, e. durans, and e. mundtii, were examined in this study. we found that the groes genes of these enterococcal species are identical in length (285 nucleotides) and contain an unusual putative start codon, gtg. the lengths and sequences of the intergenic regions (spacers between  the groes and groel genes) are quite variable (17 to 57 bp in length) among enterococcus species but are conserved in strains within each species, with only  a few exceptions. considerable variation of groes or groel sequences was also observed. the evolutionary trees of groes or groel sequences revealed similarities among enterococcus species. however, the overall intraspecies variation of groes was less than that of groel. the high interspecies variation and low intraspecies variation indicate that the groes and spacer sequences are more useful than groel for identification of clinically relevant enterococcus species. the sequences of these two genetic traits, groes and spacer, can be determined by a single pcr and direct sequencing and may provide important information for the differentiation of closely related species of enterococcus.

TI  == drug resistance in fecal enterococci in hong kong.
AB  == our purpose was to estimate the rate of carriage of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) in hospitalized patients in a district hospital and in healthy  subjects in the community in hong kong. rectal swabs were collected from all patients admitted to the intensive care unit, and stool specimens were collected  from all patients presenting with suspected antibiotic-associated diarrhea over a 2-month period. stool specimens were also collected from healthy subjects in the  community. specimens were enriched and cultured on selective media for the isolation of enterococci. all isolates were identified, and their minimum inhibitory concentration for vancomycin was determined. susceptibility to other antibiotics was investigated. samples yielded 125 isolates of enterococci, the majority of isolates being enterococcus faecalis (75) and e. faecium (35). nine of 11 strains of e. gallinarum and 2 of 2 strains of e. casseliflavus isolated from hospitalized patients were intermediately resistant to vancomycin, but no strains highly resistant to vancomycin were isolated. resistance to other drugs,  including the fluoroquinolones, was present, and a high-level resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin was found in 37% and 46% of strains, respectively. colonization with vre remains low in hong kong. this result is supported by the low level of isolation of vre from infections in the region and may be attributable to low levels of vancomycin use. high-level aminoglycoside resistance and fluoroquinolone resistance are common, and continued monitoring for vre is suggested.

TI  == vancomycin resistance, esp, and strain relatedness: a 1-year study of enterococcal bacteremia.
AB  == the prevalence of esp, a gene associated with infection-derived and outbreak strains, in enterococcal blood isolates from 2002 was determined. fifty-five of 137 (40.1%) enterococcus faecalis isolates, 30 of 58 (51.7%) e. faecium isolates, 1 of 1 e. raffinosus isolate, 0 of 4 e. gallinarum isolates, and 0 of 1 e. casseliflavus isolate were positive. esp wasn't associated with vancomycin resistance (vr) or clinical service. vr e. faecium isolates were less genetically diverse than vancomycin-susceptible strains. a large cluster of vr isolates, belonging to esp-positive e. faecium, was revealed. these data support the hypothesis that esp and vr may contribute to dissemination of particular clones.

TI  == emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in a tertiary hospital in crete, greece: a cluster of cases and prevalence study on intestinal colonisation.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of five consecutive cases of infection with vancomycin-resistant  enterococci (vre) and the prevalence of faecal carriage of vre among patients admitted to a 700-bed university hospital where no vre had been isolated previously. in a 2-month period, five consecutive patients infected with vre were detected. three vanb+ enterococcus faecium isolates were obtained from three patients, while two vana+ e. faecium isolates, one vana+ enterococcus faecalis isolate and one vanc1+ enterococcus gallinarum isolate were obtained from the other two patients. of 218 faecal specimens from all hospital wards, 41 (18.8%) were found to contain vre. forty-two isolates of vre were obtained, comprising one (2%) e. faecalis, 11 (27%) e. faecium, 24 (57%) e. gallinarum and six (14%) enterococcus casseliflavus/flavescens. four isolates carried the vana gene, eight carried vanb, 24 carried vanc1, and six carried vanc2/c3. use of glycopeptides, the presence of central venous catheters and renal dialysis all correlated with vre colonisation. the prevalence rates were among the highest reported in the literature.

TI  == enterococcus gallinarum carrying the vana gene cluster: first report in brazil.
AB  == in 2000, enterococcus faecalis resistant to vancomycin was first reported at a tertiary hospital in porto alegre, southern brazil. the resistance spread to other hospitals and surveillance programs were established by hospital infection  committees to prevent the spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. in february 2002, an isolate initially identified at the genus level as enterococcus was obtained by surveillance culture (rectal swab) from a patient admitted to a hospital for treatment of septic arthritis in the shoulder. the isolate proved to be resistant to vancomycin by the disc diffusion method and confirmed by an e-test resulting in a minimal inhibitory concentration of > or = 256 microg/ml. this isolate was sent to a reference laboratory (laboratorio especial de bacteriologia e epidemiologia molecular, faculdade de ciencias farmaceuticas de ribeirao preto, usp) for further study and proved to be an e. gallinarum by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using specific primers for the species. due to the phenotype of unusually high vancomycin resistance, the isolate presumably had the resistance genes (vana and vanb) and this was confirmed by pcr, which indicated the presence of the vana gene. a 10.8-kb tn1546-related transposon was  also identified by long-pcr. interspecies transfer of the vancomycin-resistance gene from the donor e. gallinarum was performed in a successful conjugation experiment in vitro, using e. faecium ge-1 and e. faecalis jh22 as receptors. this is the first report of the detection of a vana determinant naturally acquired by e. gallinarum in brazil, indicating the importance of characterizing  vre by both phenotype and genotype methods.

TI  == [antibiotic susceptibility analysis of enterococcus spp. isolated from urine].
AB  == recently increase of enterococcal infections has been observed. these bacteria, mainly enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium are members of the normal flora of gastrointestinal tract but also are typical opportunistic pathogens. enterococci are characterized by natural resistance to numerous antibiotics (among them cephalosporins), and also by easy acquired resistance to antibiotics. infections caused by multiresistant strains are difficult in treatment, chronic,  recurrent and sometimes fatal are described. enterococcal infections are caused often by e. faecalis, rarely by e. faecium. in the last years other species of enterococci have been isolated from different clinical materials (e. casseliflavus, e. avium, e. durans, e. gallinarum). the aim of this study was to  analyze the antibiotics susceptibility of enterococcus spp. isolated from urine of children with urinary tract infection (uti), hospitalized in the upper silesian health center of child and mother or treated ambulatory. susceptibility  of the 130 strains of e. faecalis and 41 e. faecium to: penicillin, tetracycline, high level of aminoglycoside (gentamycin 120 microg and streptomycin 300 microg), glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin), ciprofloxacin and nitrofurantoin was  estimated. all isolated strains of e. faecalis (100%) were sensitive to glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin) and to nitrofurantoin, 96% strains were sensitive to penicillin, 43% to ciprofloxacin and 28% to tetracycline. all strains of e. faecium were sensitive to glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin), 32% strains were sensitive to penicillin, 19% to tetracycline 14% to ciprofloxacin and 50% to nitrofurantoin. twenty two strains of e. faecalis (17%) and twelve strains of e. faecium (29%) were demonstrated high level resistance to aminoglycosides (hlar). among hlar strains of enterococci, were observed strains of high level resistance only to streptomycin, high level resistance only to gentamycin and high level resistance to both aminoglycosides.  the hlar strains of e. faecalis and e. faecium were also resistant to other antibiotics: penicillin, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. the most frequent cause  of child urinary tract infection was e. faecalis, with high sensitivity to penicillins, glycopeptides and nitrofurantoin. the increased role of e. faecium and other strains of enterococci also has been shown. these species demonstrated  sensitivity to glycopeptides, but resistance to other antibiotics, routinely used for treatment of uti as well as to nitrofurantoin.

TI  == molecular epidemiology and antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococci recovered  from brazilian intensive care units.
AB  == we studied the antimicrobial resistance and the molecular epidemiology of 99 enterococcal surveillance isolates from two hospitals of brasilia, brazil. conventional biochemical tests were used to identify the enterococcal species and the disk diffusion method was used to determine their resistance profiles. enterococcus faecalis (76%) and e. faecium (9%) were the most prevalent species.  no enterococci showed the vana or vanb vancomycin resistance phenotypes or genotypes. only the intrinsically resistant species e. gallinarum (n=2) and e. casseliflavus (n=3) harbored the vancomycin-resistance genes vanc1 and vanc2/3, respectively. we found e. faecalis isolates with high-level resistance to gentamicin (22%) and streptomycin (8%) and both e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates with resistance to more than two antimicrobials (84% and 67%, respectively). nine e. faecalis isolates (12%) were resistant to ampicillin; the  minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values were 16 microg/ml (n=6) and 32 microg/ml (n=3). among these ampicillin-resistant e. faecalis, seven were also resistant to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, rifampin, penicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and erythromycin. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis classified those  isolates in three different genotypes, suggesting dissemination of genetically related ampicillin-resistant e. faecalis strains among different patients.

TI  == detection of low levels of listeria monocytogenes cells by using a fiber-optic immunosensor.
AB  == biosensor technology has a great potential to meet the need for sensitive and nearly real-time microbial detection from foods. an antibody-based fiber-optic biosensor to detect low levels of listeria monocytogenes cells following an enrichment step was developed. the principle of the sensor is a sandwich immunoassay where a rabbit polyclonal antibody was first immobilized on polystyrene fiber waveguides through a biotin-streptavidin reaction to capture listeria cells on the fiber. capture of cells on the fibers was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. a cyanine 5-labeled murine monoclonal antibody, c11e9, was used to generate a specific fluorescent signal, which was acquired by  launching a 635-nm laser light from an analyte 2000 and collected by a photodetector at 670 to 710 nm. this immunosensor was specific for l. monocytogenes and showed a significantly higher signal strength than for other listeria species or other microorganisms, including escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella enterica, lactobacillus plantarum, carnobacterium gallinarum, hafnia alvei, corynebacterium glutamicum, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens, in pure or in mixed-culture setup. fiber-optic results could be obtained within 2.5 h of sampling. the sensitivity threshold was about 4.3 x 10(3) cfu/ml for a pure culture of l. monocytogenes grown at 37 degrees c. when l. monocytogenes was mixed with lactic acid bacteria or grown at 10 degrees c with 3.5% nacl, the detection threshold was 4.1 x 10(4) or 2.8 x 10(7) cfu/ml, respectively. in less  than 24 h, this method could detect l. monocytogenes in hot dog or bologna naturally contaminated or artificially inoculated with 10 to 1,000 cfu/g after enrichment in buffered listeria enrichment broth.

TI  == biofuel cells select for microbial consortia that self-mediate electron transfer.
AB  == microbial fuel cells hold great promise as a sustainable biotechnological solution to future energy needs. current efforts to improve the efficiency of such fuel cells are limited by the lack of knowledge about the microbial ecology  of these systems. the purposes of this study were (i) to elucidate whether a bacterial community, either suspended or attached to an electrode, can evolve in  a microbial fuel cell to bring about higher power output, and (ii) to identify species responsible for the electricity generation. enrichment by repeated transfer of a bacterial consortium harvested from the anode compartment of a biofuel cell in which glucose was used increased the output from an initial level of 0.6 w m(-2) of electrode surface to a maximal level of 4.31 w m(-2) (664 mv, 30.9 ma) when plain graphite electrodes were used. this result was obtained with  an average loading rate of 1 g of glucose liter(-1) day(-1) and corresponded to 81% efficiency for electron transfer from glucose to electricity. cyclic voltammetry indicated that the enhanced microbial consortium had either membrane-bound or excreted redox components that were not initially detected in the community. dominant species of the enhanced culture were identified by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and culturing. the community consisted mainly of facultative anaerobic bacteria, such as alcaligenes faecalis and enterococcus gallinarum, which are capable of hydrogen production. pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pseudomonas species were also isolated. for several isolates, electrochemical activity was mainly due to excreted redox mediators, and one of these mediators, pyocyanin produced by p. aeruginosa, could be characterized. overall, the enrichment procedure, irrespective of whether only attached or suspended bacteria were examined, selected for organisms capable of mediating the electron transfer either by direct bacterial transfer or by excretion of redox components.

TI  == detection and characterization of enterocins from enterococcus sp.
AB  == examination of 90 isolates of enterococcus sp. revealed production of enterocin by two isolates of e. faecalis which was inhibitory to listeria monocytogenes. two isolates of e. gallinarum produced enterocin active against staphylococcus aureus. none of the isolates antagonized salmonella enteritidis. the enterocins of e. faecalis isolates were inactivated by alpha-chymotrypsin but not by trypsin and papain, while those of e. gallinarum were resistant to all the three enzymes. enterocins produced by all 4 strains were resistant to heating at 60 degrees c for 30 min and 80 degrees c for 10 min, but sensitive to 121 degrees c for 15 min. at 100 degrees c for 10 min, two enterocins, one each of e. faecalis and e.  gallinarum were inactivated, while the remaining two retained the bactericidal activity.

TI  == evaluation of the prevalence and risk factors for colonization by vancomycin-resistant enterococcus among patients on dialysis.
AB  == background: vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) has been reported among long-term dialysis patients, although risk factors for vre colonization are not well defined. this study aims to appraise the prevalence and risk factors for vre colonization among patients on long-term dialysis therapy, as well as the mechanisms for dissemination of vancomycin resistance. methods: this is a cross-sectional survey of 320 patients on long-term dialysis therapy at 2 hospitals of the federal university of sao paulo from june 2001 to march 2003. fecal samples were collected from each patient once a week for 1 month. samples with positive test results for vre were submitted to molecular typing through automated ribotyping. results: vre prevalence was 14.4%. there were significant associations between vre and dialysis type (hemodialysis, p = 0.04), number of hospitalizations (p = 0.03), low hemoglobin level (p = 0.03), and leukocytosis (p = 0.05). among samples with vre (n = 56), 25% were enterococcus faecium; 10.7%, enterococcus casseliflavus; 57.1%, enterococcus gallinarum; and 3.6%, enterococcus faecalis. all samples isolated were sensitive to teicoplanin, except for e faecium samples, which were strongly resistant, although 9 of 14 patients with this isolate presented the same ribogroup (111-s-4). typing of 6 samples from 8 dialysis patients with e gallinarum was performed, showing a predominant ribogroup (112-s-4). conclusion: hospital environment, hemodialysis, anemia, and  leukocytosis appear to be associated with vre colonization. these results suggest that dissemination of these bacteria among patients on long-term dialysis therapy may be taking place.

TI  == lack of correlation between phenotypic techniques and pcr-based genotypic methods for identification of enterococcus spp.
AB  == a total of 123 genetically-unrelated strains of enterococcus spp. strains (51 enterococcus faecalis, 57 enterococcus faecium, 10 enterococcus gallinarum, and 5 enterococcus casseliflavus) were phenotypically identified by biochemical profiles and by using an automated method. the strains were also analyzed by a pcr assay to assess the accuracy of the phenotypically-based methods for identification of enterococcus spp. with this aim, a pcr assay using different cell targets, which allows simultaneous detection of glycopeptide-resistant genotypes as well as identification to the species level by means of different gene targets, was used as the gold standard method. all 51 strains of e. faecalis were correctly identified, whereas 48 of 57 strains (84.2%) of e. faecium, were correctly identified. all of the strains of e. gallinarum and 3 out of 5 strains  of e. casseliflavus were also correctly identified. the overall results showed that it is possible to identify enterococcus spp. at the molecular level in less  than 30 hours, compared with the 48-96 hours required for the phenotypically-based methods. the excellent accuracy of the pcr assay in identifying these species, particularly e. faecium, must also be emphasized. these findings may have implications for the routine clinical identification of enterococci species.

TI  == substantially increased faecal carriage of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in a  tertiary greek hospital after a 4 year time interval.
AB  == objectives: in a tertiary greek hospital with no documented vancomycin-resistant  enterococci (vre) infections, a cross-sectional study was conducted in order to determine the degree of vre faecal carriage among adult patients hospitalized in  high-risk units. methods: specimens for the surveillance were collected from separate patients in two periods (january-may 1999 and january-may 2003); 258 specimens were submitted during the first period and 149 during the second period. results: three patients (1.2%) were colonized with vre during the first period, whereas 52 (34.9%) were colonized during the second period. two vre isolates of the first period were enterococcus faecalis and one enterococcus faecium, whereas those of the second period were e. faecium except for three e. faecalis and two enterococcus gallinarum. all vre isolates apart from the two e.  gallinarum isolates were positive for the vana gene. the 48 vancomycin-resistant  e. faecium were classified into eight clonal types, one of those predominating with 29 isolates; the remaining included one to nine isolates. the five vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis formed four distinct clonal types. conclusions:  the study reports a substantially higher prevalence of vre carriage when the surveillance was repeated after a 4 year time interval. urgent infection control  measures are needed to prevent emergence of vre outbreaks in our hospital setting.

TI  == mechanism of intrinsic resistance to vancomycin in clostridium innocuum ncib 10674.
AB  == we have studied the basis for intrinsic resistance to low levels of vancomycin in clostridium innocuum ncib 10674 (mic = 8 microg/ml). analysis by high-pressure liquid chromatography (hplc) and mass spectrometry of peptidoglycan nucleotide precursors pools revealed the presence of two types of udp-murnac-pentapeptide precursors constitutively produced, an udp-murnac-pentapeptide with a serine at the c terminus which represented 93% of the pool and an udp-murnac-pentapeptide with an alanine at the c terminus which represented the rest of the pool. c. innocuum cell wall muropeptides containing pentapeptide[ser], either dialanine substituted on the epsilon amino group of lysine or not, were identified and represented about 10% of the monomers while only 1% of pentapeptide[d-ala] monomers were found. the sequence of a 2,465-bp chromosomal fragment from c. innocuum was determined and revealed the presence of ddl(c. innocuum) and c. innocuum racemase genes putatively encoding homologues of d-ala:d-x ligases and amino acid racemases, respectively. analysis of the pool of precursors of enterococcus faecalis jh2-2, containing cloned ddl(c. innocuum) and c. innocuum racemase genes showed in addition to the udp-murnac-pentapeptide[d-ala], the presence of an udp-murnac-pentapeptide[d-ser] precursor. however, the expression  of low-level resistance to vancomycin was observed only when both genes were cloned in e. faecalis jh2-2 together with the vanxyc gene from enterococcus gallinarum bm4174 which encodes a d,d-peptidase which eliminates preferentially the high affinity vancomycin udp-murnac-pentapeptide [d-ala] precursors produced  by the host. we conclude that resistance to vancomycin in c. innocuum ncib 10674  was related to the presence of the two chromosomal ddl(c. innocuum) and c. innocuum racemase genes allowing the synthesis of a peptidoglycan precursor terminating in serine with low affinity for vancomycin.

TI  == prevalence and molecular characterization of tetracycline resistance in enterococcus isolates from food.
AB  == in the present study, a collection of 187 enterococcus food isolates mainly originating from european cheeses were studied for the phenotypic and genotypic assessment of tetracycline (tc) resistance. a total of 45 isolates (24%) encompassing the species enterococcus faecalis (n = 33), e. durans (n = 7), e. faecium (n = 3), e. casseliflavus (n = 1), and e. gallinarum (n = 1) displayed phenotypic resistance to tc with mic ranges of 16 to 256 microg/ml. eight of these strains exhibited multiresistance to tc, erythromycin, and chloramphenicol. by pcr detection, tc resistance could be linked to the presence of the tet(m) (n  = 43), tet(l) (n = 16), and tet(s) (n = 1) genes. in 15 isolates, including all of those for which the mic was 256 micro g/ml, both tet(m) and tet(l) were found. furthermore, all tet(m)-containing enterococci also harbored a member of the tn916-tn1545 conjugative transposon family, of which 12 erythromycin-resistant isolates also contained the erm(b) gene. filter mating experiments revealed that  10 e. faecalis isolates, 3 e. durans isolates, and 1 e. faecium isolate could transfer either tet(m), tet(l), or both of these genes to e. faecalis recipient strain jh2-2. in most cases in which only tet(m) was transferred, no detectable plasmids were acquired by jh2-2 but instead all transconjugants contained a member of the tn916-tn1545 family. sequencing analysis of pcr amplicons and evolutionary modeling showed that a subset of the transferable tet(m) genes belonged to four sequence homology groups (shgs) showing an internal homology of  > or = 99.6%. two of these shgs contained tet(m) mosaic structures previously found in tn916 elements and on lactobacillus and neisseria plasmids, respectively, whereas the other two shgs probably represent new phylogenetic lineages of this gene.

AB  == the increasing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (vre) infections and the limited number of antimicrobial agents for their treatment emphasize a need for new, more effective agents. in this study, the in vitro activity of daptomycin was determined against a collection of 156 vre from seven different institutions. van types were characterized by pcr, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was performed to exclude isolates with >85% relatedness by dendrogram. included were 126 enterococcus faecium (109 vana, 17 vanb) isolates,  5 enterococcus faecalis (3 vana, 2 vanb) isolates, 2 enterococcus avium (vana) isolates, 1 enterococcus durans (vana) isolate, 10 enterococcus gallinarum (vanc1) isolates, and 12 enterococcus casseliflavus (vanc2) isolates. mics of daptomycin and five additional agents were determined by the nccls broth microdilution method with mueller-hinton (mh) broth containing supplemental calcium. mics were also determined using two investigational e-test strip formulations, and disk diffusion testing was performed by the standard nccls method. the mic of daptomycin at which 50% of the isolates tested were inhibited  for this isolate collection was 4 microg/ml, and the mic at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited was 8 microg/ml. two isolates of vana e. faecium were resistant to linezolid, and one isolate was resistant to quinupristin-dalfopristin. mics of daptomycin determined by the e test with and without added calcium varied by 8- to 16-fold, and disk diffusion zones varied by 3 to 6 mm according to the calcium content of the commercial mh agar lots used in the study. this study has shown daptomycin to have good activity against a diverse collection of contemporary vre isolates. however, improved standardization of the calcium content of mh agar will be important for reliable  testing of daptomycin by clinical laboratories using either the e test or disk diffusion methods.

AB  == presently, enterococci take the third place of bacterial pathogens associated with nosocomial infections, after staphylococci and escherichia coli. especially, the resistances of enterococci to several available antibiotics are threatening.  we attempted to determine which species of enterococci could be found in food of  animal origin and their significance according to their antibiotic resistances for human beings. from november 2000 to may 2002 we investigated 155 samples of food of animal origin bought in retail outlets in germany: 27 samples of sausages, 19 of ham, 83 of minced meat, 26 of cheese. from these food samples we  isolated 416 enterococcal strains. the most frequent species was enterococcus faecalis (299 strains); furthermore, we found enterococcus faecium (54 strains),  enterococcus durans together with enterococcus hirae (24 strains), enterococcus casseliflavus (22 strains), enterococcus avium (9 strains) and enterococcus gallinarum (8 strains). we focused on the resistance patterns of 118 selected e.  faecium and e. faecalis strains to 13 antimicrobial active agents (ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, avilamycin, chloramphenicol, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, flavomycin, gentamicin, penicillin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, teicoplanin, tetracycline and vancomycin). from the clinical point of view, the situation of antibiotic resistance to the examined antimicrobial agents seemed to be favourable. the investigated strains were sensitive to ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. these antibiotics are, in combination with an aminoglycoside, for example gentamicin, agents of choice for the treatment of enterococcal infections in human medicine. only one e. faecium strain was resistant to penicillin, while all strains were sensitive to the glycopeptide antibiotics, vancomycin and teicoplanin. resistances found against the antibiotics, tetracycline, quinupristin/dalfopristin and erythromycin, are causes for concern.

TI  == species identification and detection of vancomycin resistance genes in enterococci of animal origin by multiplex pcr.
AB  == a multiplex pcr assay for the differentiation of species and detection of vancomycin (van) resistance genes in enterococci was established. three hundred sixty-seven enterococcal strains isolated from food were selected from a sample collection and were examined with regards to the existence of four vancomycin resistance genes (vana, vanb, vanc1 and vanc2) and to species differentiation (e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. casseliflavus and e. gallinarum) by multiplex pcr. apart from unambiguous results for the majority of strains, the e. faecium specific primers used here, showed weak points in the specificity and sensitivity, respectively. despite these rare instances, we succeeded in optimising the multiplex pcr assay by variation of annealing temperature and primer combination. the assay presented here, with its optimised parameters, is therefore suitable for routine use and because of time and material saving, it is an alternative and rapid method in comparison to conventional tests.

TI  == taxonomy, ecology and antibiotic resistance of enterococci from food and the gastro-intestinal tract.
AB  == apart from genotypic identification methods, there is a need for reliable conventional phenotypic identification schemes for simple and rapid determination of enterococcal species in food or in the gastro-intestinal tract (git). only a limited number of enterococcal species is of importance for the ecology of the git or the food microflora, including e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. durans/hirae, e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus. after genus identification the differentiation within these species can include, e.g. mannitol and arabinose fermentation and growth at 50 degrees c. widely used commercial identification systems may fail to precisely identify rare species. ecological aspects should also be taken into account. in the human git e. faecium is the most common species whereas in most animal species e. faecalis is at least present in the same amount. especially in foods of animal origin (cheese, pork meat, beef, poultry meat) also e. faecalis is very frequent. this is of special interest as glycopeptide resistance is most often found in human clinical e. faecium strains  as well as in e. faecium from the environment or animal samples and less frequent in e. faecalis strains. eu experts propose as safety criteria for probiotics in feed additives the exclusion of resistances or the lack of transferability. this  proposal can also be applied to enterococci in foods. specific resistances must be excluded, but transferability or acquisition of resistance (e.g. vancomycin) cannot be excluded per se. however, technologically used strains should differ from clinical strains concerning their resistance patterns and transfer rates.

TI  == infrequent occurrence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in poultry from malaysian wet markets.
AB  == fifty samples of chicken, duck and geese faeces were obtained from 13 wet markets in kuala lumpur to study the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) among local market poultry. biotyping of colonies grown on azide agar incubated at 45 degrees c yielded e. pseudoavium, e. faecalis, e. faecium and e. gallinarum from chicken faeces and e. malodoratus, e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. hirae/dispar, and e. durans from goose and duck faeces. on agar containing 6 mg/ l of vancomycin, one strain of e. flavescens was identified, giving a vre detection rate of 2.0%. this isolate had a vancomycin m.i.c. of 8 mg/l as determined by the etest, and the van c-3 gene that was identified by pcr followed by sequence analysis. the prevalence of vre among poultry sold in local markets appears to be low, and may reflect the infrequent use of antimicrobials in our poultry farms. nevertheless, the possibility of human acquisition of microbes via the food chain cautions against the use of antimicrobials in animal husbandry that may encourage the emergence and spread of multi-drug resistant organisms like the vre among animal microbial flora.

TI  == susceptibility of gram-positive bacteria from icu patients in uk hospitals to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == microbiologists in 25 sentinel laboratories were each asked to refer up to 100 clinically-significant gram-positive bacteria isolated from consecutive intensive care unit (icu) patients. a total of 1595 isolates were collected from patients in 23 hospitals; these included staphylococcus aureus (47.6%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (30.6%), enterococci (14.3%), pneumococci (2.8%) and other streptococci (3.5%). a few coryneforms, other bacilli and a nocardia sp. were also collected. rates of oxacillin resistance among s. aureus and cns isolates were 59.3 and 78.5%, respectively. vancomycin-resistant s. aureus were not detected, although two isolates (0.3%) were resistant to teicoplanin [minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) 8 mg/l]. in contrast, 13.7% of cns were teicoplanin resistant (mics 8-32 mg/l) and 1.2% were resistant to vancomycin. among the enterococci, 72.5% were enterococcus faecalis and 24.5% were enterococcus faecium, the remainder including isolates of enterococcus casseliflavus or enterococcus gallinarum. eighteen percent of e. faecium isolates were vancomycin-resistant, compared with only 3% of e. faecalis isolates. rates of high-level gentamicin resistance in e. faecalis and e. faecium were 40 and 25%, respectively. nine percent of pneumococci and streptococci were resistant to penicillin, with 7 and 11%, respectively, resistant to erythromycin. none of the  isolates showed resistance to linezolid, with the mics for the entire study population falling in the range of 0.5-4 mg/l.

TI  == carbon source utilization profiles as a method to identify sources of faecal pollution in water.
AB  == aims: carbon source utilization profiles as a phenotypic fingerprinting methodology for determining sources of faecal pollution in water were evaluated.  methods and results: three hundred and sixty-five enterococcus isolates were collected from known faecal sources in four different geographical regions and were identified to species with the commercial biolog system. discriminant analysis (da) was used to identify the substrate-containing wells that best classified the 365 isolates by source. by using 30 of the 95 wells for the analysis, the average rate of correct classification (arcc) by source was 92.7% for a human vs non-human two-way classification when isolates from all regions were combined into one library. corresponding arccs for other classification schemes were 81.9% for a four-way classification of human vs livestock vs wildlife vs domestic pets, and 85.7% for a three-way classification without human isolates. when three individual libraries were made based on classification of sources within enterococcus species, the arcc was 95.3% for the ent. faecalis library, 95.8% for the ent. gallinarum library and 94.7% for the ent. mundtii library. thirty enterococcus isolates (unknown sources) were obtained from each of three stream sites where a specific source of pollution was apparent; 90.0% of the isolates from a human-suspected source were classified as human, 86.6% were classified as livestock from a livestock-suspected site, and 93.3% were classified as wildlife from a wildlife-suspected site. conclusions: phenotypic fingerprinting with carbon source utilization profiles provided levels of correct classification by sources from an enterococcus library that were in the upper range of those reported in the literature. arccs for three enterococcus species-specific libraries were very high and may be the best approach for further developing this concept and methodology. significance anc impact of the study: the results, based on a modest enterococcus library and a preliminary field validation test, demonstrated the potential for carbon source utilization profiles to be employed as a phenotypic method for determining sources of faecal  pollution in water.

TI  == [drug sensitivity of enterococcus sp. strains isolated from clinical material or  from healthy persons].
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the drug susceptibility of enterococcus sp. strains isolated in 2000-2001, from patients of five warsaw's hospitals (154 strains) and from fecal samples of healthy persons (33 strains). on biochemical reaction profiles species of clinical enterococci were identified as: e. faecalis--66.2%, e. faecium--29.2%, e. hirae--1.9%, e. gallinarum--1.3%, e. casseliflavus--0.6% and e. avium--0.6%. the species of enterococci from stool's samples were identified as: e. faecalis--28 strains, e. durans--2 strains and single strains: e. faecium, e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus. susceptibility to 20 antibiotics was tested by disc diffusion method. none of these 187 enterococcal strains was vancomycin resistant; 3 strains of e. gallinarum and 1--e. casseliflavus demonstrated intermediately susceptibility to vancomycin, but they were susceptible to teicoplanin--phenotype van c. among clinical strains were resistant to penicillin--33.3% of e. faecalis and 100% of e. faecium, to ampicillin--over 80% of e. faecium and 1 strain of e. faecalis. none of these strains produced beta-lactamase. high-level resistance to aminoglicoside was expressed by 48 strains (47.1%) e. faecalis and 36 (80%) e. faecium isolated from clinical specimens. both--hlr to streptomycin and gentamycin were found in 28.3%  of e. faecalis and 68.9% of e. faecium. among 33 strains isolated from fecal samples of healthy persons--3 of e. faecalis were resistant to streptomycin and one was resistant to both gentamicin and streptomycin. in general, enterococcal strains isolated from samples of healthy persons were susceptible to the most of  used antibiotics. but to rifampicin none of these strains were susceptible. there were about 40% of e. faecalis strains isolated from healthy persons, resistant to tetracyline.

TI  == role of the transmembrane domain of the vant serine racemase in resistance to vancomycin in enterococcus gallinarum bm4174.
AB  == enterococcus gallinarum bm4175 (a vancomycin-susceptible derivative of bm4174 obtained by insertional inactivation of vanc-1) was transformed with plasmid constructs pca10 (containing the genes necessary for resistance, vanc-1-xyc-t), pjp1 (with a fragment lacking the dna encoding the transmembrane region of vant,  -vanc-1-xyc-t((delta))(2-322)-) and with plasmids containing fragments encoding either the transmembrane (mvant(1-322)) or racemase (svant(323-698)) domains of vant under the control of a constitutive promoter. accumulated peptidoglycan precursors were measured in all strains in the presence of l-ser, d-ser (50 mm) or in the absence of any growth supplement. uptake of 0.1 mm l-[(14)c]serine was  also determined in bm4174, bm4175 and bm4175/pca10. vancomycin resistance was restored in bm4175 transformed with pca10(c-1-xyc-t), and the profile of peptidoglycan precursors was similar to wild-type e. gallinarum bm4174. transformation of e. gallinarum bm4175 with plasmid pjp1(vanc-1-xyc-t((delta))(2-322)) resulted in: (i) vancomycin mics remaining within susceptible levels (< or =4 mg/l) in the absence of any growth supplement, but increasing to 8 mg/l when either l-ser or d-ser was added to the medium; and  (ii) the relative amounts of accumulated udp-murnac-pentapeptide[d-ser] and tetrapeptide precursors decreasing substantially compared with bm4175/pca10 and bm4174. the effect on the appearance of tetrapeptide appeared to be host dependent, since a substantial amount was present when the same plasmid construct pjp1(vanc-1-xyc-t((delta))(2-322)) was electroporated into enterococcus faecalis  jh2-2. the uptake of l-[(14)c]ser at 240 s was decreased by approximately 40% in  bm4175 compared with bm4174. plasmid pca10(c-1-xy(c)-t) restored uptake of l-[(14)c]ser at 180 and 240 s in bm4175. the results suggest that the transmembrane domain of vant is likely to be involved in the transport of l-ser,  and that in its absence the resistance phenotype is compromised.

TI  == phenotypes and genotypes of vancomycin-resistant enterococci isolated during long-term follow-up in a patient with recurrent bacteremia and colonization.
AB  == twenty-seven isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were obtained at monthly intervals from a bed-ridden man with hypoxic encephalopathy. during the 28-month period of the patient's hospitalization, 3 episodes of bacteremia and one episode of catheter-related infection caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci occurred. rectal swabs showed colonization of vancomycin-resistant enterococci for more than 2 years. three months after termination of antimicrobial therapy, the rectal colonization for vancomycin-resistant enterococci was eradicated. four species (enterococcus faecium, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus casseliflavus) were identified among the 27 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus isolates. three non-clonal related patterns were found among 17 strains of e. faecium by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. all of the 3 e. faecalis isolates were of the vanb phenotype, but of the vana genotype. linezolid had the most potent in vitro  activity against these vancomycin-resistant enterococcus isolates, with minimum inhibitory concentrations >2 microg/ml. eighty-five percent of these vancomycin-resistant enterococcus isolates were susceptible to tetracycline and 66% were susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. although a high genetic correlation of e. faecium was identified in the patient with prolonged hospitalization, the isolation of 3 genetically unrelated colonized isolates suggested a lack of correlation between infection and colonization. precautions against resistant organisms, adapted antibiotic policies, and elimination of patient carriage are useful for controlling the spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci.

AB  == the prevalence of streptogramin resistance genes in enterococci recovered from retail poultry in the greater washington dc area was examined. forty-three chicken and 32 turkey retail samples were analysed. thirty-one non-enterococcus faecalis enterococcal strains were isolated that displayed mics of quinupristin-dalfopristin and virginiamycin of > or = 4 mg/l. these included enterococcus faecium (turkey n = 4, chicken n = 23), enterococcus gallinarum (turkey n = 2, chicken n = 1) and enterococcus hirae (chicken n = 1). the presence of streptogramin resistance genes was examined by pcr in all non-e. faecalis isolates. the vat(e) gene was detected in 10/23 chicken e. faecium and from 2/4 turkey e. faecium. no other streptogramin resistance genes were detected by pcr. in addition, erm(b) was detected in all the e. faecium and e. gallinarum  found in turkeys and in 7/23 e. faecium found in chickens. the vat(e) gene was transferable by conjugation from only two of the 12 e. faecium isolates (one from chicken and one from turkey). this study suggests that there is a high prevalence of low-level streptogramin resistance among enterococci found in retail poultry and that other, yet to be identified, mechanisms operate in these isolates that confer streptogramin resistance in enterococci.

TI  == characterization of tn1546 in vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium isolated  from canine urinary tract infections: evidence of gene exchange between human and animal enterococci.
AB  == thirty-five enterococcal isolates were recovered from dogs diagnosed with urinary tract infections at the michigan state university veterinary teaching hospital over a 2-year period (1996 to 1998). isolated species included enterococcus faecium (n = 13), enterococcus faecalis (n = 7), enterococcus gallinarum (n = 11), and enterococcus casseliflavus (n = 4). antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed several different resistance phenotypes, with the majority of the enterococcal isolates exhibiting resistance to three or more antibiotics. one e.  faecium isolate, cvm1869, displayed high-level resistance to vancomycin (mic > 32 micro g/ml) and gentamicin (mic > 2,048 micro g/ml). molecular analysis of this isolate revealed the presence of tn1546 (vana), responsible for high-level vancomycin resistance, and tn5281 carrying aac6'-aph2", conferring high-level aminoglycoside resistance. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that cvm1869 was a canine e. faecium clone that had acquired tn1546, perhaps from a human vancomycin-resistant e. faecium. transposons tn5281 and tn1546 were located on two different conjugative plasmids. sequence analysis revealed that in tn1546, orf1 had an 889-bp deletion and an is1216v insertion at the 5' end and an is1251 insertion between vans and vanh. to date, this particular form of tn1546 has only been described in human clinical vancomycin-resistant enterococcus isolates unique to the united states. additionally, this is the first report of a vancomycin-resistant e. faecium isolated from a companion animal in the united states.

TI  == potential of enterococcus faecalis as a human fecal indicator for microbial source tracking.
AB  == regulatory agencies are interested in a fecal indicator bacterium with a host range limited to humans because human fecal contamination represents the greatest hazard to humans, yet is a relatively easy nonpoint source to remedy. watersheds  with human fecal contamination could be given first priority for cleanup. a fecal indicator bacterium with a host range limited to humans and a few other warm-blooded animal species would also simplify microbial source tracking because only a few animal species would be required for any host origin database. the literature suggests that the fecal indicator bacterium enterococcus faecalis has  a limited host range. on this basis, we selected this bacterium for study. of 583 fecal streptococcal isolates obtained on enterococcosel agar from canada goose, cattle, deer, dog, human, chicken, and swine, 392 were considered presumptive enterococci and were subsequently speciated with the api 20 strep system. of these isolates, 22 were ent. durans (5.6%), 61 were ent. faecalis (15.6%), 98 were ent. faecium (25.0%), 86 were ent. gallinarum (21.9%), and 125 were unidentified (31.9%). the host range of the ent. faecalis isolates was limited to dogs, humans, and chickens. media were developed to isolate and identify ent. faecalis quickly from fecal samples and this scheme eliminated ent. faecalis isolates from dogs. when the remaining ent. faecalis isolates were ribotyped, it  was possible to differentiate clearly among the isolates from human and chicken.  it may be that combining the potentially limited host range of ent. faecalis with ribotyping is useful for prioritizing watersheds with fecal contamination.

AB  == objective: to assess the ability of 59 clinical microbiology laboratories distributed throughout italy to correctly identify and detect reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides in staphylococci and vana-, vanb- or vanc-mediated glycopeptide resistance in enterococci. methods: eight test strains comprising three staphylococci (s. aureus atcc 29212 and two vancomycin-intermediate s. haemolyticus [11105301, 10030683y]) and five enterococci (e. faecalis atcc 29212, e. faecalis atcc 51299 vanb, e. faecium aib40 vana, e. faecalis v583 vanb and e. gallinarum aib39 vanc1) were distributed to 59 italian clinical microbiology laboratories. each isolate was blind-coded, and laboratories were instructed to identify the strains and test isolates for susceptibility to teicoplanin and vancomycin using their standard methods. results were assessed against consensus test results obtained by a reference laboratory. in addition, to complement data interpretation, laboratories were asked to provide retrospective routine test results from their respective hospitals. results: all 59 laboratories participating in the study completed the  susceptibility testing and provided data for analysis. a total of 53 laboratories provided retrospective routine data. overall, laboratories were able to identify  isolates to the genus level successfully. e. gallinarum and s. haemolyticus posed problems for species identification, with only 40.6 and 71.2%, respectively, of results reported correctly; most incorrect results were reported as 'other species'. for enterococcal test strains, vana phenotypes were detected correctly  by 96.6% of laboratories; vanb by 30.5% (e. faecalis atcc 51299) and 88.1% (e. faecalis v583); and vanc1 by 67.8%. for staphylococcal test strains, 28.8% (s. haemolyticus 11105301) and 23.7% (s. haemolyticus 10030683y) of the laboratories  were able to detect reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. errors in detecting vancomycin resistance in vanb and vanc1 enterococci were made with all methods, most noticeably by disk diffusion users. for staphylococci, most errors in reporting vancomycin-intermediate resistance occurred with disk diffusion and vitek (software version 5.04) users. overall, considerably fewer errors occurred  with the detection of teicoplanin resistance, especially for staphylococci. for 1999, routine results show that 41/1749 (2.4%) of e. faecium, 220/11 180 (2.0%) of e. faecalis, 29/24 927 (0.12%) of s. aureus and 54/22 102 (0.24%) of coagulase-negative staphylococci were reported as resistant to vancomycin. conclusion: italian laboratories are able to identify staphylococci and enterococci adequately, although all methodologies used have problems in identifying e. gallinarum and coagulase-negative staphylococci to the species level. while vana phenotypes were efficiently detected, problems were experienced in detecting vanb and vanc phenotypes. the majority of laboratories were unable to detect reduced vancomycin susceptibility in staphylococci adequately, especially with disk diffusion and older vitek systems. teicoplanin appeared useful as a marker for detecting vancomycin resistance, particularly with disk diffusion. should enterococcal vanb or staphylococcal glycopeptide-intermediate phenotypes become prevalent in italy, it is likely that they would be under-detected. new systems under development, such as vitek2, should improve this situation.

TI  == identification of enterococci and determination of their glycopeptide resistance  in german and austrian clinical microbiology laboratories.
AB  == objective: to determine exactly how german and austrian routine laboratories perform tests for the identification of enterococci and determination of their glycopoptide resistance. methods: six enterococcal test strains with different types of glycopeptide resistance (enterococcus faecium, vana; e. faecalis, vana;  e. faecium, vanb; e. faecalis, vanb; e. gallinarum, vanc1; e. casseliflavus, vanc2) were sent as anonymous isolates to 73 clinical microbiology laboratories (65 in germany; eight in austria). the participating laboratories had to identify the strains up to the species level and to determine their antibiotic susceptibilities to the glycopeptides vancomycin and teicoplanin by the test method(s) that are used daily in the corresponding laboratories. results: the analysis of the results received from 62 laboratories (56 from germany, six from  austria) demonstrated that the most used routine method in susceptibility testing was the agar diffusion test, followed by the etest, and the microbroth dilution procedure. the majority of participants had no difficulties in susceptibility testing with the vana-type strains. however, the agar diffusion test was often not able to recognize clearly the vanb and vanc strains; some problems also arose with vanb isolates in the etest. with the microbroth dilution method, the corresponding type of glycopeptide resistance was correctly determined in the majority of enterococcal test strains. difficulties also arose in identification, especially with the vanc strains (e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus), which were often falsely identified as e. faecium. the reasons for these errors are obviously based on the lack of important tests (such as motility and presence of  a yellow pigment) in some commercially available identification test kits.

TI  == composition of enterococcal and streptococcal flora from pigeon intestines.
AB  == aims: to identify the streptococcal and enterococcal components of the microflora from pigeon intestines to species level by tdna-intergenic polymerase chain reaction. methods and results: gram-positive coccal strains were isolated from the intestines or faeces of 50 different pigeons, all from different lofts, on columbia cna blood agar. sodium azide-sensitive enterococci were found to constitute the major coccal members of the intestinal flora of pigeons. forty-two of 69 isolates were identified as enterococcus columbae (84% of animals tested positive), while e. cecorum was encountered in 28% of all animals (14 isolates).  minor species (less than 10% of pigeons positive) were e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. casseliflavus, streptococcus alactolyticus and strep. gallolyticus. contrary to the species description of e. columbae and e. cecorum,  some of the strains were found to be motile. certain other minor differences with the species description of e. columbae are also indicated. conclusions: enterococcus columbae is the major gram-positive facultatively anaerobic component of the pigeon intestinal flora. certain phenotypic characteristics differ from the original species description. the potentially pathogenic strep. gallolyticus is a minor component of the microflora. enterococcus faecium and e.  faecalis are rare in pigeons. significance and impact of the study: the enterococcal and streptococcal flora of pigeons is composed of mainly host-specific bacteria. these are not likely to act as zoonotic pathogens nor as  carriers of antibiotic resistance determinants possibly spreading to humans.

TI  == comparison of two commercially available selective media to screen for vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == campylobacter medium (campy, becton dickinson [bd] microbiology systems, cockeysville, md) and vancomycin screen agar (vsa, bd) were compared for their ability to screen for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) from primary plates. a microdilution minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) assay (pasco, bd)  served as the reference vancomycin mic. in the random sample of 200 enterococcal  clinical isolates tested, the distribution of isolates was as follows: enterococcus faecium, 113 (97 vre); enterococcus faecalis, 71(12 vre); enterococcus gallinarum, 10; and enterococcus casseliflavus, 6. of the 75 vancomycin-susceptible strains, none grew on campy and 4 grew on vsa, whereas all 109 vre isolates grew on both screen plates. of the 16 strains with a van c phenotype, ie, e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus, 2 grew on campy and 14 on vsa. of the 899 clinical specimens plated onto both agars, 45 of 67 vre were detected  with both media, 20 were detected only with campy and 2 were not detected by either screen plate. campy compared with vsa as a primary plating medium was more sensitive and, when used to screen for vre isolates from primary plates, was more specific for strains displaying van a and b phenotypes.

TI  == implications of multiple antimicrobial-resistant enterococci associated with the  poultry environment.
AB  == poultry are increasingly being associated with carriage of multiresistant organisms that may cause disease in humans. among these organisms are the enterococci, not regarded as a common cause of hospital-acquired infections. the  use of antimicrobials for growth promotion in poultry production envronments may  facilitate the dissemination of resistance to enterococcus spp. that have the potential to be clinically significant. to assess descriptively the degree of multiresistant enterococci in the poultry environment of the delmarva (delaware-maryland-virginia) east coast region of the usa, litter samples from regional commercial poultry houses and transport container swabs from processing  facilities were cultured for enterococcus spp. using a microtiter plate adaptation of a conventional biochemical screen, the predominant species identfied were e. faecalis (61.2%), e. faecium (18.6%) and e. gallinarum (2.4%).  resistance to the cephalosporin, macrolide and tetracycline classes of antimicrobials was uniform with broader resistance to penicillin and derivatives  present in a majority of e. faecium isolates. high-level streptomycin resistance  was evident in close to 30% of all isolates with a majority of e. faecalis variants possessing resistance. high-level gentamicin resistance was detected at  a low frequency (2.6%) only within the e. faecalis group with resistance to low-level gentamicin levels present in a majority of both the e. faecalis group and subsets of e. faecium. no unexpected vancomycin resistance was detected. of particular interest was resistance to the streptogramin quinupristin-dalfopristin (q-d or synercid), which was present in 70.4% of e. faecium and e. faecium variants.

TI  == d-ala:d-ala ligase gene flanking the vanc cluster: evidence for presence of three ligase genes in vancomycin-resistant enterococcus gallinarum bm4174.
AB  == an open reading frame located 230 nucleotides downstream from the stop codon of vans(c) and in the opposite direction relative to the other genes of the vanc cluster was identified in enterococcus gallinarum bm4174. this gene (designated ddl2) encoded a protein of 343 amino acids that had significant predicted structural similarity to d-ala:d-ala ligases and displayed 33 and 35% amino acid  identity to vanc-1 and the previously reported partial sequence of ddl from e. gallinarum, respectively. biochemical characterization by thin-layer chromatography confirmed that ddl2 is a d-ala:d-ala ligase with no detectable d-ala:d-ser ligase activity. the vancomycin dependence of enterococcus faecalis bm4320 (ddl mutant) was lost on electroporation of a plasmid construct expressing ddl2 constitutively. the latter strain was able to grow in the absence of vancomycin, and peptidoglycan precursor analysis under the same conditions indicated the synthesis of pentapeptide[d-ala] as the main precursor, confirming  the activity of ddl2 in vivo. expression of ddl and ddl2 in bm4174 was tested by  reverse transcription-pcr: results suggested that both d-ala:d-ala ligases were expressed concomitantly. our findings indicate that vancomycin-resistant e. gallinarum bm4174 is likely to express one d-ala:d-ser and two d-ala:d-ala ligase genes.

TI  == [epidemiological study on vancomycin-resistant enterococci from fecal samples in  the east area of japan].
AB  == recently, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) have become important nosocomial pathogens in the world. in japan, the vre-infection was first reported in 1996. however, an epidemiological study on vre has not been aggressively done in japan. we conducted a survey study to explore the incidence and antimicrobial susceptibility of vancomycin-resistant enterococci isolated from fecal samples at 45 hospitals in the east area of japan (kanto, koshinetsu, tohoku, and hokkaido)  during june 1998 to march 1999. the enterococcosel agar containing vanocomycin (bbl) was used for screening vre from fecal samples in each hospital. the susceptibilities of the isolates to 8 antimicrobials were determined by the broth microdilution method and the definitions of resistance were based on current standards of the nccls standards. the vre genotypes (vana, vanb, vanc1, and van c2/3) were confirmed by amplifying the respective genes by pcr. eight hundred and ninety four strains of enterococci were tested by the microtiter plates hybridization method (wakunaga seiyaku, japan). one thousand five hundred eighty  three strains of enterococci were collected from 6,914 patients in 45 hospitals.  these strains included 72 (4.5%) strains enterococcus faecalis, 33 (2.1%) strains enterococcus faecium, 17 (1.1%) strains enterococcus avium, 1,040 (65.7%) strains enterococcus gallinarum, 386 (24.4%) strains enterococcus cassliflavus, and 35 (2.2%) strains enterococcus flavescens. these strains of vancomycin-resistant e.  faecalis were isolated from 3 patients, two of these 3 strains had van a gene and other one had van b gene. those 3 strains were in the kanto area, and 2 of 3 strains were in tokyo, generally, though van a type vre was highly resistaant to  both vancomycin and teicoplanin. in our study, two strains of van a type e. faecalis were highly resistant to vancomycin (mics > 128 micrograms/ml) and susceptible to teicoplanin with mics 4 micrograms/ml. those two strains were different in susceptibilities of minocycline and ofloxacin. the result of the analysis of pfge had also different patterns. vanb type e. fecalis was highly resistant to vancomycin and susceptible to teicoplanin (mics 0.25 microgram/ml).  for ampicillin and imipenem, 3 strains of e. faecalis were susceptible (mic < or  = 1 microgram/ml). one of 562 strains of e. gallinarum had vanb and vanc1 genes and was moderately resistant to vancomycin and susceptible to teicoplanin. all strains of e. casseliflavus and e. flavescens had vanc2/c3 gene only. all strains of e. faecium and e. avium did not detect van genes. from this result, it was supposed that vre were very rare in the east of japan.

TI  == phenotypic and genetic diversity of enterococci isolated from italian cheeses.
AB  == in the present study, 124 enterococcal strains, isolated from traditional italian cow, goat and buffalo cheeses, were characterized using phenotypic features and randomly amplified polymorphic dna polymerase chain reaction (rapd-pcr). the rapd-pcr profiles obtained with four primers and five different amplification conditions were compared by numerical analysis and allowed an inter- and intraspecific differentiation of the isolates. whole cell protein analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) was used as  a reference method for species identification. the strains were identified as enterococcus faecalis (82 strains), e. faecium (27 strains), e. durans (nine strains), e. gallinarum (four strains) and e. hirae (two strains). species recognition by means of rapd-pcr was in agreement with the sds-page results except for eight strains of e. faecium that clustered in separated groups. on the other hand, phenotypic identification based on carbohydrate fermentation profiles, using the rapid id 32 strep galleries, gave different results from sds-page in 12.1% of the cases. the majority of the strains had weak acidifying and proteolytic activities in milk. one e. faecium strain showed vana (vancomycin resistance) genotype while four strains showed a beta-haemolytic reaction on human blood. several strains showed antagonistic activity towards indicator strains of listeria innocua, clostridium tyrobutyricam and propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii.

TI  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of gram-positive aerobic clinical  isolates. mics were determined by an agar dilution method on mueller-hinton agar  (nccls/eucast) and on isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/l free calcium (bsac). both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. daptomycin mics for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/l. for 99 of the 100 enterococci (enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/l. for all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin mics were 0.016- 0.25 mg/l; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/l. for miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including lactobacillus spp., lactococcus spp., leuconostoc spp., pediococcus spp. and isolates of enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin mics were 0.03-2 mg/l; mics for the seven isolates of listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/l. there was little difference between the results on mueller-hinton agar and  on supplemented isotonic agar the discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented isotonic agar. daptomycin was active (mics < or = 2 mg/l) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of e. faecium and l. monocytogenes (mics = 4 mg/l). our results indicate that daptomycin mics are independent of methicillin and vancomycin mics.

TI  == resistance to linezolid: characterization of mutations in rrna and comparison of  their occurrences in vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == to assess the potential for emergence of resistance during the use of linezolid,  we tested 10 clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) (four enterococcus faecalis, five enterococcus faecium, and one enterococcus gallinarum) as well as a vancomycin-susceptible control (atcc 29212) strain of e. faecalis. the enterococci were exposed to doubling dilutions of linezolid for 12  passes. after the final passage, the linezolid plate growing vre contained a higher drug concentration with e. faecalis than with e. faecium. dna sequencing of the 23s rrna genes revealed that linezolid resistance in three e. faecalis isolates was associated with a guanine to uracil transversion at bp 2576, while the one e. faecium isolate for which the mic was 16 microg/ml contained a guanine to adenine transition at bp 2505.

TI  == gastrointestinal colonisation of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus in a singapore teaching hospital.
AB  == vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) has become an important nosocomial pathogen in many countries but is still rare in singapore. a study was conducted  from january to march 1997 at a 900-bed teaching hospital to determine the prevalence of intestinal colonisation of vre in the patient population. a total of 299 consecutive stool specimens received by the microbiology laboratory for routine testing were plated onto two different selective media for comparison. vre isolated were phenotypically characterised using minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) to vancomycin and teicoplanin and then typed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) with smal digestion of dna. vre were detected in the stool of 35 patients (12.3%). this group consisted of four isolates with vanb (one enterococcus faecalis and three e. faecium) and 31 isolates with vanc (30 e. casseliflavus and one e. gallinarum). two patients (0.7%) carried isolates (both vanb) with high level resistance to vancomycin (mic > or = 256 microg/ml) while the rest had isolates of low level resistance (mic =  8 microg/ml). except for isolates from the same patients, pfge patterns were diverse, suggesting that the vre isolates were genotypically different and possibly introduced from many sources. this study demonstrates that vre colonisation is not uncommon in the singapore patient population.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of enterococci in lebanon.
AB  == there is little information on the types of enterococcus spp and their antibiotic resistance patterns in lebanon. one hundred and fifty-three consecutive clinical  enterococcal isolates collected between 1998 and 1999 were tested against 11 antimicrobial agents using disk diffusion and the etest. the isolates were identified by conventional methods and api-strep and were found to consist of enterococcus faecalis (72.5%), enterococcus faecium (22.9%), enterococcus avium (3.2%) and enterococcus gallinarum (1.3%). the percent of resistant strains of e. faecalis and e. faecium respectively were, ampicillin 0.9 and 14%, erythromycin 59% and 40%, tetracycline 72% and 34%, chloramphenicol 32 and 11%, rifampin 36% and 57%, ciprofloxacin, 23% and 34%, norfloxacin 22 and 8%. high level aminoglycoside (hla) resistance was found in 19% e. faecalis and 9% e. faecium for gentamicin and 36% and 26% for streptomycin. excellent correlation was observed between the high level disk tests and the etest in the detection of hla  resistance but not with the regular disks. none of the isolates showed resistance to vancomycin or teicoplanin except for one e. gallinarum isolate which showed intermediate resistance (mic 16 mg/l) to vancomycin. these variable antimicrobial rates of resistance suggest a surveillance programme for antimicrobial resistance in this country would be helpful to help control infection, guide empirical antibiotic therapy and implement a policy of antibiotic usage.

TI  == detection and characterization of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in farm animals and raw meat products in italy.
AB  == the emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) in europe has been ascribed to the long-time use of the glycopeptide antibiotic avoparcin as feed additive in food animals, until its ban in 1997 in eu. the pres- ence of vre in food of animal origin is believed to represent a potential risk for the consumer. we studied the fecal carriage of vre in broiler chickens and slaughter pigs in italy before the avoparcin ban and eval- uated the impact of avoparcin withdrawal on the presence of vre in raw meat products. broilers and pigs were both found to be frequently colonized by vre, as 36% and 24.6% of the flocks or the herds, respec- tively, were positive. molecular typing of vre strains by pfge showed that animals housed in different pens within the same farm were colonized by clonally related strains. after the avoparcin ban, a decrease in the rate of vre  contamination in meat products was observed. such a decrease was statistically significant in poultry (from 18.8% to 9.6%) but not in pork products (from 9.7% to 6.9%). the majority of vre from all sources carried the vana resistance gene and included enterococcus faecium, e. faecalis, e. hirae, e. durans, and e. gallinarum. none of the strains carried the vanb gene, whereas constitutively resistant vanc-positive strains were frequently found. our results show that avoparcin withdrawal has been successful in reducing vre contamination in meat products. however, this measure needs to be complemented by a prudent use of glycopeptide antibiotics in human medicine.

(< or = 11 mm, resistant; > or = 18 mm, susceptible), 5% of the vancomycin-resistant strains tested would have been considered fosfomycin resistant. minimal inhibitory concentrations of most vancomycin-resistant isolates were in the intermediate sensitivity range, yielding an mic50 of 32 mg/l and an mic90 of 64 mg/l. moreover the majority of inhibitory zone sizes by the disc diffusion method (din 58940) corresponded to intermediate susceptibility. these results suggest that fosfomycin at a high dosage and possibly used in combination with other drugs could be a potentially useful drug for the treatment of infections caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci.

TI  == evidence for horizontal gene transfer in evolution of elongation factor tu in enterococci.
AB  == the elongation factor tu, encoded by tuf genes, is a gtp binding protein that plays a central role in protein synthesis. one to three tuf genes per genome are  present, depending on the bacterial species. most low-g+c-content gram-positive bacteria carry only one tuf gene. we have designed degenerate pcr primers derived from consensus sequences of the tuf gene to amplify partial tuf sequences from 17 enterococcal species and other phylogenetically related species. the amplified dna fragments were sequenced either by direct sequencing or by sequencing cloned  inserts containing putative amplicons. two different tuf genes (tufa and tufb) were found in 11 enterococcal species, including enterococcus avium, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus dispar, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus malodoratus, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus pseudoavium, and enterococcus raffinosus. for  the other six enterococcal species (enterococcus cecorum, enterococcus columbae,  enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus sulfureus, enterococcus saccharolyticus, and  enterococcus solitarius), only the tufa gene was present. based on 16s rrna gene  sequence analysis, the 11 species having two tuf genes all have a common ancestor, while the six species having only one copy diverged from the enterococcal lineage before that common ancestor. the presence of one or two copies of the tuf gene in enterococci was confirmed by southern hybridization. phylogenetic analysis of tuf sequences demonstrated that the enterococcal tufa gene branches with the bacillus, listeria, and staphylococcus genera, while the enterococcal tufb gene clusters with the genera streptococcus and lactococcus. primary structure analysis showed that four amino acid residues encoded within the sequenced regions are conserved and unique to the enterococcal tufb genes and the tuf genes of streptococci and lactococcus lactis. the data suggest that an ancestral streptococcus or a streptococcus-related species may have horizontally  transferred a tuf gene to the common ancestor of the 11 enterococcal species which now carry two tuf genes.

AB  == the highly conserved central loop of domain v of 23s rna (nucleotides 2042 to 2628; escherichia coli numbering) is implicated in peptidyltransferase activity and represents one of the target sites for macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b antibiotics. dna encoding domain v (590 bp) of several species of enterococcus was amplified by pcr. twenty enterococcal isolates were tested, including enterococcus faecium (six isolates), enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus avium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus casseliflavus (two isolates of each), and enterococcus raffinosus, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus malodoratus, and enterococcus hirae (one isolate of each).  for all isolates, species identification by biochemical testing was corroborated  by 16s rrna gene sequencing. the sequence of domain v of the 23s rrna gene from e. faecium and e. faecalis differed from those of all other enterococci. the domain v sequences of e. durans and e. hirae were identical. this was also true for e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus. e. avium differed from e. casseliflavus by 23 bases, from e. durans by 16 bases, and from e. malodoratus by 2 bases. e. avium differed from e. raffinosus by one base. despite the fact that domain v is  considered to be highly conserved, substantial differences were identified between several enterococcal species.

TI  == identification of enterococcus species and phenotypically similar lactococcus and vagococcus species by reverse checkerboard hybridization to chaperonin 60 gene sequences.
AB  == data from four recent studies (s. h. goh et al., j. clin. microbiol. 36:2164-2166, 1998; s. h. goh et al., j. clin. microbiol. 34:818-823, 1996; s. h. goh et al., j. clin. microbiol. 35:3116-3121, 1997; a. y. c. kwok et al., int. j. syst. bacteriol. 49:1181-1192, 1999) suggest that an approximately 600-bp region  of the chaperonin 60 (cpn60) gene, amplified by pcr with a single pair of degenerate primers, has utility as a potentially universal target for bacterial identification (id). this cpn60 gene id method correctly identified isolates representative of numerous staphylococcal species and streptococcus iniae, a human and animal pathogen. we report herein that this method enabled us to distinguish clearly between 17 enterococcus species (enterococcus asini, enterococcus rattus, enterococcus dispar, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus durans, enterococcus cecorum, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus malodoratus, enterococcus raffinosus, enterococcus avium, enterococcus pseudoavium, enterococcus new sp. strain facklam, and enterococcus saccharolyticus), and vagococcus fluvialis, lactococcus lactis, and lactococcus garvieae. from 123 blind-tested samples, only two discrepancies were observed between the facklam and collins phenotyping method (r. r. facklam and m. d. collins, j. clin. microbiol. 27:731-734, 1989) and the cpn60 id method. in each case, the discrepancies were resolved in favor of the cpn60 id method. the species distributions of the 123 blind-tested isolates were enterococcus new sp.  strain facklam (atcc 700913), 3; e. asini, 1; e. rattus, 4; e. dispar, 2; e. gallinarum, 20; e. hirae, 9; e. durans, 9; e. faecalis, 12; e. mundtii, 3; e. casseliflavus, 8; e. faecium, 25; e. malodoratus, 3; e. raffinosus, 8; e. avium,  4; e. pseudoavium, 1; an unknown enterococcus clinical isolate, sp. strain r871;  vagococcus fluvialis, 4; lactococcus garvieae, 3; lactococcus lactis, 3; leuconostoc sp., 1; and pediococcus sp., 1. the cpn60 gene id method, coupled with reverse checkerboard hybridization, is an effective method for the identification of enterococcus and related organisms.

TI  == random amplification of polymorphic dna versus pulsed field gel electrophoresis of smai dna macrorestriction fragments for typing strains of vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == genetic typing of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) can be performed using a variety of methods, but comparative analyses of the quality of these methods are  still relatively scarce. we here compare random amplification of polymorphic dna  (rapd) analysis with pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge) of dna macrorestriction fragments as examples of two of the recent and well-accepted molecular typing methods. for the latter method, empirical guidelines for the interpretation of the dna fingerprints have been proposed in the international literature. based on our experimental analyses, we define similar criteria for rapd fingerprinting. a collection of 100 strains of vre, comprising enterococcus  faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus avium, enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus, was assembled. fifty isolates were dutch, another 50  were isolated in the uk. strains were selected on the basis of previously determined putative identity, close relatedness or uniqueness. the strains were analysed using well-standardised rapd and pfge protocols. resulting fingerprints  were interpreted with computerised methods involving band positioning and we show that typing of vre by pfge and rapd generates highly congruent dna fingerprint clustering. when the proposed international criteria for interpretation of pfge fingerprints were applied in our case, 86% pfge homology as discriminating value  between close relatedness and uniqueness, a 75% homology cut-off for the comparison of the rapd-generated dna fingerprints revealed essentially identical  strain clusters. as a spin-off it is revealed that strains from the different species can be efficiently discriminated, that strains from the uk and the netherlands form separate clusters and that strains from veterinary origin can be identified separately as well.

TI  == evaluation of d-xylose and 1% methyl-alpha-d-glucopyranoside fermentation tests for distinguishing enterococcus gallinarum from enterococcus faecium.
AB  == to determine the validity of the rapid xylose and methyl-alpha-d-glucopyranoside  (mdg) fermentation tests in distinguishing enterococcus gallinarum from enterococcus faecium, 156 well-characterized clinical isolates of enterococci (55 e. gallinarum, 91 e. faecium, and 10 enterococcus faecalis isolates) known to be  of different clones were examined in a blinded fashion. species identification was confirmed by pcr of the ddl ligase genes of e. faecium and e. faecalis and the vanc1 gene of e. gallinarum. xylose tests were performed with d-xylose tablets by using a heavy bacterial suspension and were interpreted after 2 h of incubation. standard mdg fermentation tests were read after 24 h of incubation. the xylose fermentation test had a sensitivity of 98% (54 of 55) and a specificity of 99% (100 of 101) in distinguishing e. gallinarum from e. faecium and e. faecalis. the standard mdg test had a sensitivity of 100% (55 of 55) and a specificity of 95% (96 of 101) after 24 h. the xylose fermentation test is a simple method, easily incorporated into laboratory protocols, that distinguishes  e. gallinarum from e. faecium with high sensitivity and specificity in 2 h. the standard mdg test has high sensitivity and can be useful in ruling out the presence of e. gallinarum but requires overnight incubation.

TI  == enterococci with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin in new zealand.
AB  == this study was conducted to determine the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) in the stools of hospitalized patients with possible antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. from 176 faecal samples collected during 1997 and 1998, 66 strains of enterococci were recovered using vancomycin enrichment techniques. only six of these displayed reduced susceptibility to vancomycin (mic 8-12 mg/l). all vre were positive for the presence of the vanc gene. based on motility, pigment production and automated gram-positive identification (gpi vitek card), four of these six vre isolates were identified as enterococcus gallinarum. the remaining two isolates were non-motile and therefore were considered to be enterococcus faecium. however, 16s rdna sequence analysis and positive methyl-alpha-d-glucopyranoside tests indicated that they were non-motile species of e. gallinarum. this is consistent with the intrinsic, low-level vanc-1-mediated resistance associated with this species. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis comparisons between the vre indicated genetic relatedness between some strains. this work confirms that vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and enterococcus faecalis are rare in new zealand.

TI  == a survey of the enterococci isolated from an artisanal italian goat's cheese (semicotto caprino).
AB  == enterococci were isolated from semicotto caprino cheese, a traditional cheese produced in southern italy: they were a significant part of the microbial population of this cheese, confirming the importance of the presence of these micro-organisms during cheese-making and ripening. they were also identified and  studied for their phenotypic and genotypic characteristics: enterococcus faecalis and ent. faecium were the most frequently isolated species, followed by ent. durans, ent. hirae and ent. gallinarum. none of the isolates showed lipolytic activity, whereas they were characterized by a relevant proteolytic activity as well as an antagonistic activity towards listeria innocua. one strain of ent. gallinarum showed a low-level resistance to vancomycin, while six out of the 79 ent. faecalis strains possessed beta-haemolysis reaction. the highest acidifying  potential in skim milk was obtained by ent. faecalis isolates. thirty enterococcal strains representative of the different species at different ripening times were analysed by means of rapd-pcr, and revealed species-specific  profiles for all the considered species.

TI  == cost-effective algorithm for detection and identification of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in surveillance cultures.
AB  == a study was undertaken to develop an easy-to-use and cost-effective algorithm for the detection and identification of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) in surveillance cultures, because the incidence of vre outbreaks in institutions across canada has made continuous surveillance a necessity. enterococcus faecium  and enterococcus faecalis carry transferable resistance genes and hence are a problem for infection control. in laboratory surveillance, however, enterococcus  gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus, which exhibit low-level nontransferable resistance, are also encountered and often create confusion in identification. included in this study were a total of 218 strains of enterococci and other streptococci isolated from surveillance cultures. conventional methods  were used to determine their biochemical activities, and speciation was attempted in 121 strains using a rapid multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method that utilized primers for the vana, b, c1, c2/c3 and ddl genes. the results indicated that by using only a few tests (gram stain, pyrrolidonyl arylamidase activity, motility, xylose and methyl-alpha-d-glucopyranoside utilization), enterococcus faecium/faecalis strains could be accurately differentiated from enterococcus gallinarum/casseliflavus strains. for the 121 strains on which pcr was performed, there was a 100% correlation with the biochemical identification,  with the added advantage that the presence of van genes could be determined at the same time. the cost of identification using minimal biochemical testing and pcr was less than that of identification using automated systems or a battery of  conventional biochemical methods. the algorithm presented here may be used in the microbiology laboratory.

TI  == characterization of a highly glycopeptide-resistant enterococcus gallinarum isolate.
AB  == background and purpose: adequate treatment of emergency infection involving antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as vancomycin-resistant enterococcus requires  a convergence of clinical and bacteriologic techniques. an isolate of enterococcus gallinarum, designated as tsgh63, is known to be uncommonly vancomycin-resistant. this study investigated the genetic determinant for this unique characteristic. methods: after completing the conventional identification  and sensitivity tests, the genomic content of e. gallinarum tsgh63 was extracted  and analyzed by pulse-field electrophoresis. a set of specific primers for vana,  vanb, vanc1, and vanc2/c3 genes was then applied in a multiplex polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) to differentiate its genetic content. to locate the determinant for high vancomycin resistance, the electrophoresis profile was further analyzed  by southern blot using the digoxigenin (dig)-labeled vana gene probe. finally, interspecies transfer of the vancomycin-resistance determinant of e. gallinarum tsgh63 was tested by a conjugation experiment in vitro. results: a 50-kb plasmid  was identified in the analysis of the genomic extract of e. gallinarum tsgh63 by  pulse field electrophoresis. using multiplex pcr, we demonstrated that e. gallinarum tsgh63 harbors a vana gene in addition to a vanc1 gene. the dig-labeled vana gene-specific probe bound to the plasmid exclusively on the southern blot. the plasmid-carried vana gene, but not the vanc1 gene, was found to be transferable from tsgh63 to e. faecalis jh2-2 by conjugation in vitro. conclusions: this is the first report of isolation of e. gallinarum with a high level of resistance to glycopeptides in taiwan. the demonstrated interspecies transfer of the vancomycin-resistance gene highlights the importance of stringent control of the use of vancomycin.

AB  == in february 1996, a hospital infection control practices advisory committee-style screening program was commenced to isolate and subsequently characterize glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (gre) from patients at a hospital trust in glasgow, scotland. over the next 30 months, gre were isolated from 154 patients.  gre were isolated from patients in traditionally high-risk areas such as the renal unit and intensive care unit and also in areas considered to be lower risk, including medical wards and associated long-stay geriatric hospitals. the majority (90%) of isolates were enterococcus faecium vanb. the remaining isolates consisted of seven e. faecalis (vana), three e. gallinarum (vanc), and a further  six e. faecium (five vana, one both vana and vanb) isolates. analysis of smai-digested dna by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed that 34 of 40 (85%) vanb e. faecium isolates were identical or closely related, while 11 of 13  (85%) vana gre were distinct. high-level aminoglycoside resistance was seen in less than 8% of isolates. vanb e. faecium isolates were almost uniformly resistant to ampicillin and tetracycline. in this study, gre have been isolated over a prolonged period from a broad range of patients. glycopeptide resistance within the study hospital trust appeared to be mainly due to the clonal dissemination of a single strain of e. faecium vanb.

AB  == we evaluated the new automated vitek 2 system (biomerieux) for the identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of enterococci. the results obtained with the vitek 2 system were compared to those obtained by reference methods: standard identification by the scheme of facklam and sahm [r. r. facklam and d. f. sahm, p. 308-314, in p. r. murray et al., ed., manual of clinical microbiology, 6th ed., 1995] and with the api 20 strep system and, for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, broth microdilution and agar dilution methods by the procedures of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the presence of vana and vanb genes was determined by pcr. a total of  150 clinical isolates were studied, corresponding to 60 enterococcus faecalis, 55 enterococcus faecium, 26 enterococcus gallinarum, 5 enterococcus avium, 2 enterococcus durans, and 2 enterococcus raffinosus isolates. among those isolates, 131 (87%) were correctly identified to the species level with the vitek 2 system. approximately half of the misidentifications were for e. faecium with low-level resistance to vancomycin, identified as e. gallinarum or e. casseliflavus; however, a motility test solved the discrepancies and increased the agreement to 94%. among the strains studied, 66% were vancomycin resistant (57 vana, 16 vanb, and 26 vanc strains), 23% were ampicillin resistant (mics, >/=16 microgram/ml), 31% were high-level gentamicin resistant, and 45% were high-level streptomycin resistant. percentages of agreement for susceptibility and resistance to ampicillin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin and for high-level gentamicin resistance and high-level streptomycin resistance were 93, 95, 97, 97, and 96%, respectively. the accuracy of identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of enterococci with the vitek 2 system, together with the  significant reduction in handling time, will have a positive impact on the work flow of the clinical microbiology laboratory.

TI  == comparison of phenotypic methods to identify enterococci intrinsically resistant  to vancomycin (vanc vre).
AB  == clinical laboratories must be able to differentiate between enterococci possessing acquired resistance to vancomycin (vana and vanb genotypes) from those that are inherently resistant (vanc1 and vanc2/c3 genotypes). we compared several routine phenotypic tests to determine the species identity of clinical isolates of enterococci and a pcr assay for the van ligase genes was used to confirm identification of vanc vre. the vitek gram positive identification card identified 53/60 (88%) enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium isolates and 81/141 (57%) vanc vre without additional testing. another 32 of the vanc vre required additional testing (e.g., motility and pigmentation) for correct identification.  however, 7 of these 32 vanc vre were nonmotile. the rapid id 32 strep strips identified 50/60 (83%) e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates and 102/141 (72%) vanc vre. all e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates were nonmotile and did not acidify 1% methyl-alpha-d-glucopyranoside (mgp). only 93/115 (81%) e. gallinarum and 21/26 (81%) e. casseliflavus/e. flavescens were motile but all 141 vanc vre acidified mgp. mgp acidification can accurately differentiate vanc vre from e. faecalis and e. faecium. because some vanc vre isolates are nonmotile, mgp acidification is preferred as a simple and less costly test for identification of these isolates.

TI  == gene vanxyc encodes d,d -dipeptidase (vanx) and d,d-carboxypeptidase (vany) activities in vancomycin-resistant enterococcus gallinarum bm4174.
AB  == vanx and vany have strict d,d-dipeptidase and d,d-carboxypeptidase activity, respectively, that eliminates production of peptidoglycan precursors ending in d-alanyl-d-alanine (d-ala-d-ala) in glycopeptide-resistant enterococci in which the c-terminal d-ala residue has been replaced by d-lactate. enterococcus gallinarum bm4174 synthesizes peptidoglycan precursors ending in d-ala-d-serine (d-ala-d-ser) essential for vanc-type vancomycin resistance. insertional inactivation of the vanc-1 gene encoding the ligase that catalyses synthesis of d-ala-d-ser has a polar effect on both d, d-dipeptidase and d,d-carboxypeptidase  activities. the open reading frame downstream from vanc-1 encoded a soluble protein designated vanxyc (mr 22 318), which had both of these activities. it had 39% identity and 74% similarity to vany in an overlap of 158 amino acids, and contained consensus sequences for binding zinc, stabilizing the binding of substrate and catalysing hydrolysis that are present in both vanx- and vany-type  enzymes. it had very low dipeptidase activity against d-ala-d-ser, unlike vanx, and no activity against udp-murnac-pentapeptide[d-ser], unlike vany. the introduction of plasmid pat708(vanc-1,xyc) or pat717(vanxyc) into vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis jh2-2 conferred low-level vancomycin resistance only when d-ser was present in the growth medium. the peptidoglycan precursor profiles of e. faecalis jh2-2 and jh2-2(pat708) and jh2-2(pat717) indicated that the function of vanxyc was hydrolysis of d-ala-d-ala and removal of d-ala from udp-murnac-pentapeptide[d-ala]. vanc-1 and vanxyc were essential, but not sufficient, for vancomycin resistance.

AB  == we isolated 1487 enterococcus species from 1200 stool specimens collected from high-risk patients in 12 canadian tertiary care hospitals between october 1995 and november 1996. the composition of the 1487 isolates was 601 vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus faecalis (40.4%), 667 vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus faecium (44.9%), 18 vancomycin-resistant (nine isolates mic 8-16 micrograms/ml; nine isolates mic > or = 32 micrograms/ml) e. faecium (vref) (1.2%), 95 vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus gallinarum (6.4%), 29 vancomycin-resistant (all mics 8-16 micrograms/ml) e. gallinarum (2.0%), and 77 vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus casseliflavus (5.2%). nine of the 18 vref isolates collected possessed the vana genotype and were from three patients at one hospital. two other vref isolates, of the vanb genotype, were from a single patient at a second hospital, and the remaining seven isolates, also all of the vanb genotype, were from five patients at a third hospital. all vref were ampicillin resistant (mic > or = 16 micrograms/ml), streptomycin resistant (mic > 1000 micrograms/ml), and ciprofloxacin resistant (mic > or = 4 micrograms/ml). ten of the 18 vref were also resistant to gentamicin (mic > 500 micrograms/ml), while all 18 isolates had quinupristin/dalfopristin mics < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. in conclusion, high-risk patients in tertiary care canadian hospitals are rarely  colonized (9/1200 patients, 0.75%) with vref in their lower gastrointestinal tract. these findings correlate well with the lack of reported vref infection in  high-risk patients in canadian hospitals. quinupristin/dalfopristin demonstrated  excellent in vitro activity against vref and other non-faecalis species of enterococcus, many of which also possessed high-level ampicillin, and/or high-level aminoglycoside, and/or ciprofloxacin resistance.

TI  == development of a pcr assay for rapid detection of enterococci.
AB  == enterococci are becoming major nosocomial pathogens, and increasing resistance to vancomycin has been well documented. conventional identification methods, which are based on culturing, require 2 to 3 days to provide results. pcr has provided  a means for the culture-independent detection of enterococci in a variety of clinical specimens and is capable of yielding results in just a few hours. however, all pcr-based assays developed so far are species specific only for clinically important enterococci. we have developed a pcr-based assay which allows the detection of enterococci at the genus level by targeting the tuf gene, which encodes elongation factor ef-tu. initially, we compared the nucleotide sequences of the tuf gene from several bacterial species (available in public databases) and designed degenerate pcr primers derived from conserved regions. these primers were used to amplify a target region of 803 bp from four enterococcal species (enterococcus avium, e. faecalis, e. faecium, and e. gallinarum). subsequently, the complete nucleotide sequences of these amplicons were determined. the analysis of a multiple alignment of these sequences revealed regions conserved among enterococci but distinct from those of other bacteria. pcr primers complementary to these regions allowed amplification of genomic dnas  from 14 of 15 species of enterococci tested (e. solitarius dna could not be amplified). there was no amplification with a majority of 79 nonenterococcal bacterial species, except for 2 abiotrophia species and several listeria species. furthermore, this assay efficiently amplified all 159 clinical isolates of enterococci tested (61 e. faecium, 77 e. faecalis, 9 e. gallinarum, and 12 e. casseliflavus isolates). interestingly, the preliminary sequence comparison of the amplicons for four enterococcal species demonstrated that there were some sequence variations which may be used to generate species-specific internal probes. in conclusion, this rapid pcr-based assay is capable of detecting all clinically important enterococci and has potential for use in clinical microbiology laboratories.

TI  == occurrence of enterococcus spp. in waters.
AB  == we studied 630 bacterial strains isolated from surface waters and determined as enterococci on the basis of their growth on slanetz-bartley agar in typical colonies. the strains were tested and characterized by several key conventional tests for basic differentiation of enterococci and by commercial test kits. we identified 135 strains of e. foecium (21%), 115 e. faecalis (18%), 30 e. mundtii  (5%), 27 e. hirae (4%), 22 e. casseliflavus (3%), 21 e. gallinarum (3%), 17 e. durans-e. hirae complex (3%), 5 e. durans (1%), and 1 strain of e. avium. 150 strains were classified only as enterococcus sp. (25%) and 107 strains (17%) isolated from slanetz-bartley agar were not enterococci. we found that the non-enterococcal group consisted of other gram-positive cocci and gram-positive and gram-negative rods. based on the identification we tried to find a relation between taxonomic position of isolated strains and their colony morphology on slanetz-bartley agar. our of the total of 523 identified enterococci, 345 strains (66%) formed purple colonies, 136 red colonies (26%), 37 pink colonies (7%) and 5 cream colored colonies (1%). there was no correlation among the color, size or colony morphology and the taxonomic characterization of enterococcal strains.

TI  == comparison of direct and enrichment methods for the selective isolation of vancomycin-resistant enterococci from feces of pigs and poultry.
AB  == isolation results of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) of fecal samples from pigs and broiler and layer chickens obtained with two vancomycin-supplemented enrichment media, kanamycin aesculin azide (kaa) broth and enterococcosel (ecc) broth, and three isolation media, kaa agar, ecc agar, and slanetz and bartley (sl) agar, were compared. direct isolation on vancomycin-containing agar plates was not efficient in swine and layer chickens, which had only low numbers of vre. in broilers chickens, the vre content of the samples was high, and sl as well as  ecc were found to perform better than kaa agar. the same three agar media were used as selective plating media after 1 and 2 days incubation of the samples in kaa and ecc enrichment broths. sensitivities of the 12 different enrichment-plate combinations tested ranged from 0 to 81% in layer chickens and from 5 to 44% in samples from pigs. in the high prevalence type of samples from broilers, sensitivities still varied substantially from 52 to 78%. incubating vancomycin-containing enrichment broths for 2 days compared with 1 day was favorable for the isolation of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, e. gallinarum, and e. casseliflavus but not for e. faecium and e. hirae/e. durans. ecc broth and ecc plates yielded the highest number of e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus. in layer as well as in broiler chickens, ecc broth incubated for 2 days and plated on ecc agar was the most sensitive method. in pigs, however, kaa  broth incubated for 2 days and plated on ecc medium yielded the highest number of vre.

TI  == cloning of insertion sequence is1485 from enterococcus species.
AB  == we have cloned and identified an insertion sequence, is1485, that was present in  several members of the genus enterococcus. is1485 exists in varying copy numbers  with at least 12 copies in e. durans (atcc 11576), 3 copies in e. faecium (atcc 19434), and one copy each in e. faecalis (atcc 19433) and e. avium (atcc 14024).  it was also detected in clinical strains of e. gallinarum, e. casseliflavus, and  e. saccharolyticus. is1485 is 1366 bp in length, it has imperfect terminal inverted repeats with 25 of the terminal 39 residues matched, and it contains three open reading frames exceeding 50 codons, designated orfa, orfb, and orfc. the largest, orfb, was located 36 bp downstream and in the -1 reading frame relative to orfa; orfc is oriented in the opposite direction and overlaps orfa. the genetic organization of is1485 resembles that of members of the is3 family of transposable elements. sequence homology exists with several members of the is3 family especially with is199 from streptococcus mutans.

TI  == practical approach to the identification of clinically relevant enterococcus species.
AB  == enterococci have become important nosocomial pathogens, with enterococcus faecalis and then enterococcus faecium predominating. because of the emergence of glycopeptide (vancomycin and teicoplanin) resistance in enterococci, laboratories have been required to screen for resistant strains and to identify them to the species level. this has resulted in the need for accurate identification of species less commonly associated with clinical infections, such as enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum, which are inherently resistant to the  glycopeptides. studies evaluating commonly used commercial identification systems, have found error rates for enterococcal species identification of 2-21%  for e. faecalis, 5-9% for e. faecium, and 14-79% for other species. reporting errors may have adverse effects on the management of clinical infections, as well as in the control of multidrug-resistant strain outbreaks. the purpose of this document is to present a simplified approach to the identification of enterococcus species that uses a combination of rapid, readily available, and inexpensive tests.

TI  == efficacy of hand disinfectants against vancomycin-resistant enterococci in vitro.
AB  == vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) may be spread within a hospital via the contaminated hands of the healthcare worker. effective hand disinfectants are necessary to break chains of transmission. we determined the bactericidal activity of 1-propanol, chlorhexidine digluconate (0.5 and 4%). sterillium (45% 2-propanol, 30% 1-propanol and 0.2% mecetronium etilsulphate), skinsept f (70% 2-propanol, 0.5% chlorhexidine digluconate and 0.45% hydrogen peroxide) and hibisol (70% 2-propanol and 0.5% chlorhexidine gluconate) against 11 clonally distinct enterococcal isolates in a quantitative suspension test. four isolates were vancomycin susceptible, four were vana and the remainder vanb positive. eight isolates were identified as enterococcus faecium, two as enterococcus faecalis and one as enterococcus gallinarum. the investigator was blinded to the  species and the genotype. four parallel experiments were carried out for each isolate, each preparation, each dilution and each reaction time. 1-propanol (60%), sterillium, skinsept f and hibisol were all highly bactericidal after 15 and 30 s against vre and vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (vse) with reduction  factors (rf) > 6.4, even in dilution of 50% (v/v). no significant difference was  observed between vana isolates, vanb isolates and vse. chlorhexidine digluconate  (0.5% and 4%) was found to be less bactericidal after 30, 60 and 300 sec (rf < or = 2.5). the vanb genotype isolates were found to be significantly more susceptible to chlorhexidine (0.5%) than the vana isolates (60 sec; one-way anova model; p = 0.05). after 300 sec the vanb genotype isolates were found to be significantly more susceptible to chlorhexidine (0.5%) than the other two genotype isolates (p = 0.016). the vana isolates were found to be significantly more susceptible to chlorhexidine (4%) than the vanb isolates (300 s; p = 0.024). e. faecium was found to be less susceptible to chlorhexidine than e. faecalis at  all concentrations and reaction times, but significant differences between rf were only observed at 60 sec for both chlorhexidine concentrations (p < 0.05; t-test for independent samples). propanol is much more effective against enterococci than chlorhexidine and combination of the two may be useful in providing an immediate and long lasting effect.

TI  == proficiency of clinical laboratories in spain in detecting vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. the spanish vre study group.
AB  == studies in a variety of u.s. clinical laboratories have demonstrated difficulty in detecting intermediate and low-level vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). the misclassification of "at least intermediate resistant isolates" as vancomycin susceptible may have both clinical implications and a negative impact on measures to control the spread of vre. no published study has assessed the ability of clinical laboratories in europe to detect vre. so, the apparent low prevalence of vre in european hospitals may be, in part, secondary to the inability of these laboratories to detect all vre. in an effort to assess european laboratories' proficiency in detecting vre, we identified 22 laboratories in spain and asked them to test four vre strains and one susceptible enterococcal strain from the centers for disease control and prevention collection. each organism was tested by the routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing method used by each laboratory. overall, vre were correctly identified in 61 of 88 (69.1%) instances. the accuracy of vre detection varied with the level of resistance and the antimicrobial susceptibility method. the high-level-resistant strain (enterococcus faecium; mic, 512 microg/ml) was accurately detected in 20 of 22 (91. 3%) instances, whereas the intermediate-resistant isolate (enterococcus gallinarum; mic, 8 microg/ml) was accurately detected in only 11 of 22 (50%) instances. classification errors occurred in 27 of 88 (30.9%) instances. misclassification as vancomycin susceptible was the most common error (16 of 27 [59.3%] instances). our study shows that the participating spanish laboratories had an overall acceptable proficiency in detecting vre but that a substantial proportion of vre isolates with low or intermediate levels of resistance were not detected. we recommend that studies be conducted to validate laboratory proficiency testing as an important step in the prevention and control of the spread of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == comparison of direct plating and broth enrichment culture for the detection of intestinal colonization by glycopeptide-resistant enterococci among hospitalized  patients.
AB  == the results of prevalence studies on glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (gre) in  the intestine may be influenced by the detection methods applied. in most studies different media, different concentrations of antibiotics, and different methods are used, and these differences result in differences in recovery rates. in this  cross-sectional study on the carrier state of gre among patients at the university hospital antwerp, antwerp, belgium, performed on 21 may 1996, direct plating and broth enrichment were compared by using the same media. stool samples (n = 213) or rectal swabs (n = 122) were plated directly on enterococcosel agar (biomerieux) and after enrichment in enterococcosel broth. the prevalence of gre  was 12.8%. direct plating recovered 53.4% of the gre isolates, and broth enrichment recovered an additional 46.5% of them; in the latter test the isolates were thus present at less than 10(3) cfu per g of feces. the prevalence of gre among dialysis patients was higher than among the other patients, but the difference was not significant (p = 0.06), possibly as a result of the small numbers of dialysis patients examined. the gre species isolated included 19 e. gallinarum (44.2%), 13 e. faecium (30.2%), 6 e. faecalis (13.9%), and 5 e. casseliflavus (11.6%) isolates. all e. faecalis and e. faecium strains isolated carried the vana gene, and e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus carried the vanc1 and vanc2 gene, respectively. the majority of isolates were polyclonal. our data  indicate that the rate of detection of gre from both stool samples and rectal swabs is significantly increased with enrichment cultures.

TI  == lactobacilli isolated from chicken intestines: potential use as probiotics.
AB  == lactobacillus strains were tested for their in vitro probiotic properties. cell surface hydrophobicity was found to be very high for lactobacillus fermentum subsp. cellobiosus and salmonella gallinarum; high values could indicate a greater ability to adhere to epithelial cells. studies on lactobacillus animalis  indicated relative cell surface hydrophobicities smaller than those of l. fermentum subsp. cellobiosus and l. fermentum. l. animalis and enterococcus faecalis were able to coaggregate with l. fermentum subsp. cellobiosus and l. fermentum, respectively, but not with salmonella gallinarum. after mixed-culture  studies for determining suitable growth behavior, the pair of strains l. animalis plus l. fermentum subsp. cellobiosus was selected for an attempted challenge against salmonella gallinarum. double and triple mixed-culture studies indicated  that selected lactobacillus strains were able to retain their beneficial characteristics in the presence of salmonella gallinarum such as presence of lectins, production of antimicrobial compounds, and ability to grow and compete.  the selected microorganisms can be considered as potential ingredients for a chicken probiotic feed formulation intended to control salmonellosis and also improve poultry sanitation.

AB  == glycopeptide resistance in enterococci is now a cause of clinical concern in the  united states and europe. however, details of vancomycin resistance in enterococci in japan have been unknown. we measured minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of various antimicrobial agents for a total of 218 clinical strains of enterococci isolated in our hospital in 1995-6 in addition to 15 strains with known genotypic markers of resistance. we also screened vancomycin resistance genes using a single step multiplex-pcr. in clinical isolates, only two strains of enterococcus gallinarum were of intermediate resistance to vancomycin (mic, 8 micrograms/ml), while the others were all susceptible. glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin) and streptogramins (rp 58500 and rpr 106972) showed potent antimicrobial effects for the isolates. in addition, ampicillin was also potent for enterococcus faecalis, while ampicillin, minocycline and gentamicin were potent for enterococcus avium. no vana or vanb genes were detected, while vanc1 and vanc23 genes were detected from two and four strains, respectively. our results suggest that incidence of vre in japan may be  estimated as still very low at this time.

AB  == in order to determine whether hospital-based clinical laboratories conducting active surveillance for vancomycin-resistant enterococci in three san francisco bay area counties (san francisco, alameda, and contra costa counties) were accurately reporting vancomycin resistance, five vancomycin-resistant enterococcal strains and one vancomycin-susceptible beta-lactamase-producing enterococcus were sent to 31 of 32 (97%) laboratories conducting surveillance. each strain was tested by the laboratory's routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing method. an enterococcus faecium strain with high-level resistance to vancomycin (mic, 512 microg/ml) was correctly reported as resistant by 100% of laboratories; an e. faecium strain with moderate-level resistance (mic, 64 microg/ml) was correctly reported as resistant by 91% of laboratories; two enterococcus faecalis strains with low-level resistance (mics, 32 microg/ml) were correctly reported as resistant by 97 and 56% of laboratories, respectively. an enterococcus gallinarum strain with intrinsic low-level resistance (mic, 8 microg/ml) was correctly reported as intermediate by 50% of laboratories. a beta-lactamase-producing e. faecalis isolate was correctly identified as susceptible to vancomycin by 100% of laboratories and as resistant to penicillin  and ampicillin by 68 and 44% of laboratories, respectively; all 23 (74%) laboratories that tested for beta-lactamase recognized that it was a beta-lactamase producer. this survey indicated that for clinically significant enterococcal isolates, laboratories in the san francisco bay area have problems in detecting low- to moderate-level but not high-level vancomycin resistance. increasing accuracy of detection and prompt reporting of these isolates and investigation of cases are the next steps in the battle for control of the spread of vancomycin resistance.

TI  == effect of vancomycin on intestinal flora of patients who previously received antimicrobial therapy.
AB  == to evaluate the ecological disturbances of peroral vancomycin administration following cephalosporin administration, 20 healthy volunteers received cefuroxime axetil tablets (250 mg) perorally twice a day for 1 week, and 10 of these volunteers subsequently received vancomycin capsules (125 mg) perorally four times daily for 7 days. the concentration of vancomycin in feces after 1 week of  vancomycin administration was high (mean +/- sd, 520 +/- 197 mg/kg), which correlated with the ecological disturbances noted in the vancomycin recipients. vancomycin administration resulted in a rapid decrease in the numbers of intestinal enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus durans (p < or = .05), while there was a significant emergence of motile enterococci with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin (enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus; minimum inhibitory concentration, 4-16 mg/l) (p < or  = .01). because of vancomycin administration, there was also a significant overgrowth of vancomycin-resistant pediococcus species and lactobacilli as well as of klebsiella species, citrobacter species, and enterobacter species (p < or = .01). the numbers of bifidobacteria and bacteroides species were significantly reduced during vancomycin administration. none of the enterococcal strains carried vana or vanb. twenty-two of the 27 motile enterococci carried the vanc-1  gene specific for e. gallinarum, whereas five strains carried the vanc-2(c-3) gene, thus implicating that they were e. casseliflavus or enterococcus flavescens.

TI  == molecular epidemiology and antibiotic susceptibility of enterococci in cincinnati, ohio: a prospective citywide survey.
AB  == to determine patterns of antimicrobial susceptibility among enterococci and to assess molecular characteristics of vancomycin-resistant enterococci, 157 clinical blood isolates of enterococci from 10 hospitals in cincinnati, ohio, were prospectively collected during a 6-month period from february to july 1995.  the isolates included 108 (69%) e. faecalis isolates, 46 (29%) e. faecium isolates, and 1 isolate each of e. avium, e. durans, and e. gallinarum. the e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates differed in their susceptibilities to ampicillin (100 versus 20%), ampicillin-sulbactam (100 versus 13%), vancomycin (100 versus 57%), imipenem (94 versus 2%), and high levels of gentamicin (59 versus 83%). supplemental susceptibility testing of the 21 vancomycin-resistant isolates showed that 21 (100%) were susceptible to chloramphenicol and that only 7 (33%) were susceptible to doxycycline. nineteen (90%) of the vancomycin-resistant e. faecium isolates were of the vanb phenotype, with vanb resistance genes detected  by pcr and hybridization with gene-specific probes; and the e. gallinarum isolates demonstrated the vanc phenotype with the vanc1 gene. one vancomycin-resistant e. faecium isolate was highly resistant to both teicoplanin  and vancomycin, corresponding to the vana phenotype; however, it was found to have the vanb gene. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) revealed that all of  the 19 e. faecium isolates with the vanb phenotype had identical to closely related banding patterns. hybridization of restriction enzyme-digested dna separated by pfge with a vanb gene probe demonstrated differences in the locations of vanb genes that corresponded closely to the pfge banding patterns. our study has documented that the emerging vancomycin resistance in our city was  mainly due to the clonal dissemination of a single strain of e. faecium vanb.

TI  == surveillance for antimicrobial resistance in enterococci.
AB  == aim: to describe antimicrobial resistance patterns of enterococcus species in auckland. background: antimicrobial resistant enterococci have emerged as major nosocomial pathogens in overseas hospitals. it is recommended that hospitals perform periodic surveys to determine local enterococcal resistance patterns. methods: enterococcal isolates from four patient groups were tested: group i were recovered from routine clinical specimens; group ii were stool isolates from patients at risk of having vancomycin resistant enterococci, eg, intensive care unit patients, patients receiving vancomycin, and immunocompromised patients receiving antibiotics; group iii were enterococci from stool specimens sent for clostridium difficile toxin testing; group iv were isolates from stool specimens  submitted to a community laboratory for enteric pathogen testing. all enterococci isolated were tested for the presence of beta-lactamase, susceptibility to amoxycillin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, and for high level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance. results: there were 121 group i enterococcal isolates. 628 stool specimens were cultured. enterococci were isolated from: 76/148 (51%) group ii specimens; 166/279 (60%) group iii specimens; and 70/201 (35%) of group  iv specimens. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on 433 isolates; 74% were e faecalis, 12% e faecium, 6% e gallinarum/casseliflavus group and 8% other enterococcal species. no isolate produced beta-lactamase. all e faecalis were susceptible to amoxycillin. two e faecium and one enterococcus species were  resistant to amoxycillin (mics all 16 mg/l). all isolates were susceptible to teicoplanin. fourteen e gallinarum/casseliflavus group isolates had intermediate  susceptibility to vancomycin (mics of 8 mg/l). one e faecium had intermediate susceptibility to vancomycin (mic 8 mg/l). high level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance occurred in 64 (15%) and 50 (12%) isolates respectively. conclusion: vancomycin resistance is rare and is essentially restricted to species that are rarely clinical pathogens, i.e., e casseliflavus and e gallinarum. our results have established the local susceptibility profile for enterococcal isolates. this allows comparison with other locations and the detection of emerging trends of resistance.

TI  == species identification of enterococci via intergenic ribosomal pcr.
AB  == accurate species identification of enterococci has become important with the wide prevalence of acquired vancomycin resistance and the presence of less epidemiologically important, inherently vancomycin-resistant enterococci. using a collection of enterococcal strains, we found that pcr amplification of the intergenic spacer (its-pcr) between the 16s and 23s rrna genes can produce amplicon profiles characteristic of the enterococcus examined. the species examined were group i enterococci (enterococcus avium, enterococcus raffinosus, enterococcus malodoratus, and enterococcus pseudoavium), group ii enterococci (enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus mundtii, and enterococcus gallinarum), and group iii enterococci (enterococcus durans and enterococcus hirae). the enterococcal species in group i, as well as e. faecalis and two strains of e. hirae, were similar and therefore had to be differentiated from each other by sau3a restriction digests. this produced patterns characteristic of each of these species. the remaining group ii and group iii enterococcal species produced amplicons characteristic of a particular species except e. gallinarum. the pcr products from e. gallinarum displayed strain-to-strain heterogeneity in the number and size of amplicons. to  further test the utility of this technique, 11 phenotypically aberrant strains which had been assigned species identification based on facklam and collins-type  strain reactions (r.r. facklam and m.d. collins, j. clin. microbiol. 27:731-734,  1989) were subjected to its-pcr. its-pcr of the phenotypically aberrant strains identified six strains with reactions consistent with those of type strains. however, five strains were characterized as follows: two strains originally identified as e. mundtii were identified by its-pcr as e. casseliflavus, one strain originally identified as e. raffinosus was identified by its-pcr as e. durans, one strain originally identified as e. hirae was identified by its-pcr as e. faecium [corrected]. we conclude that amplification of the intergenic 23s and  16s rrna gene regions of enterococci provides a reliable technique for species identification of enterococci.

TI  == evaluation of arbitrarily primed pcr analysis and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of large genomic dna fragments for identification of enterococci  important in human medicine.
AB  == the increasing problems encountered with enterococcal nosocomial infections and the intrinsic and acquired resistance of the enterococci to different antimicrobial compounds highlight the need for a rapid identification technique.  enterococcus faecalis is readily identified by biochemical tests, but species differentiation within the enterococcus faecium and enterococcus gallinarum species groups is less well established. in the present study, 66 strains representing the most prevalent human enterococci were used to develop a pcr-based species-specific identification protocol. whole-cell protein analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used as a reference method for species identification. in addition, the genomic smai macro-restriction fragment distribution of all of the strains was examined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). oligonucleotide d11344-primed pcr was as discriminative as whole-cell protein analysis and resulted in more easily interpreted band patterns. this pcr-based technique allowed identification of clinical isolates by visual examination of the dna profiles obtained. the inability of both methods to discriminate between enterococcus casseliflavus and  enterococcus flavescens brought into question the species status of e. flavescens. pfge did not result in species-discriminative dna bands or band patterns, but proved to be superior for interpretation of interstrain relationships.

TI  == a novel gentamicin resistance gene in enterococcus.
AB  == enterococcus gallinarum sf9117 is a veterinary isolate for which the mic of gentamicin is 256 micrograms/ml. time-kill studies with a combination of ampicillin plus gentamicin failed to show synergism against sf9117. a probe representing aac(6')-aph(2") did not hybridize to dna from sf9117. a 3.2-kb fragment from plasmid pyn134 of sf9117 was cloned and conferred resistance to gentamicin in escherichia coli dh5 alpha. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed the presence of a 918-bp open reading frame whose deduced amino acid sequence had a region with homology to the c-terminal domain of the bifunctional enzyme aac(6')-aph(2"). the gene is designated aph(2")-ic, and its observed phosphotransferase activity is provisionally designated aph(2")-ic. an intragenic probe hybridized to the genomic dna from an enterococcus faecium isolate from the peritoneal fluid of one patient and to the plasmid dna of an enterococcus faecalis isolate from the blood of another patient. an enterococcal isolate containing this novel resistance gene might not be readily detected in clinical laboratories that use gentamicin at 500 or 2,000 micrograms/ml for screening for  high-level resistance.

TI  == multiplex pcr detection of vana, vanb, vanc-1, and vanc-2/3 genes in enterococci.
AB  == vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) are increasingly isolated from clinical specimens. one hundred clinical isolates of enterococci (e. casseliflavus/e. flavescens [n = 10], e. faecalis [n = 34], e. faecium [n = 43], e. avium [n = 1], e. gallinarum [n = 11], and e. raffinosus [n = 1]) were examined for the presence of vana, vanb, vanc-1, and vanc-2/3 genes by a single multiplex pcr performed directly with colonies from blood agar plates. six previously characterized vre strains which carry either vana, vanb, vanc-1, or vanc-2 genes were used as controls. to discriminate among van genes, the pcr amplicons were digested with mspi and were electrophoresed on agarose gels. because of significant sequence homology between vanc-2 and vanc-3 genes, this assay is unable to discriminate these genes from each other; therefore, these are referred to as vanc-2/3 genes.  pcr products were detected in 63 of the 100 clinical isolates. the restriction fragment length patterns were consistent with vana for 10 strains, vanb for 30 strains, vanc-1 for 12 strains, vanc-2 for 6 strains, and vana and vanc-1 for 1 strain. the vancomycin mics for the isolates with restriction fragment length patterns consistent with vana and vanb were all > and = 64 micrograms/ml. the vancomycin mics for the isolates with restriction fragment length patterns consistent with vanc-1 or vanc-2 were 4 to 8 micrograms/ml. the vancomycin mics for the isolates from which no pcr amplicons were produced were 2 to 4 micrograms/ml. a pcr product was produced in four isolates (vancomycin mics, 4 to > 256 micrograms/ml) with restriction fragment length patterns differing from those for the control vana, vanb, vanc-1, and vanc-2 isolates. dna sequencing of  these amplicons revealed that two of the four isolates had nucleic acid sequences which were closely related to the published sequence for the vanb gene and two had nucleic acid sequences which were closely related to the published sequence for the vanc-2 and vanc-3 genes. multiplex pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism appears to be a useful and convenient method for rapidly detecting and discriminating genotypes for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. in the clinical laboratory. in instances in which unusual restriction fragment patterns  of pcr amplicons occur, dna sequencing can be performed to discriminate van genotypes.

AB  == certain derivatives of the glycopeptide antibiotic ly264826 with n-alkyl-linked substitutions on the epivancosamine sugar are active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci. six compounds representing our most active series were evaluated for activity against antibiotic-resistant, gram-positive pathogens. for enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis resistant to both vancomycin  and teicoplanin, the mics of the six semisynthetic compounds for 90% of the strains tested were 1 to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 2,048 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 256 micrograms/ml for ly264826. for e. faecium and e. faecalis resistant to vancomycin but not teicoplanin, the mics were 0.016 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 64 to 1,024 micrograms/ml for vancomycin. the compounds were highly active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and against e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus and showed some activity against isolates of highly vancomycin-resistant leuconostocs and pediococci. the mics for 90% of the strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus tested were typically 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 microgram/ml for vancomycin. against methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis mics ranged from 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 to 4 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 4 to 16 micrograms/ml for teicoplanin. the spectrum of these new compounds included activity against teicoplanin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci. the compounds exhibited exceptional potency against pathogenic streptococci, with mics of < or = 0.008 microgram/ml against streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant isolates. in in vivo studies with a mouse infection model, the median effective doses against a challenge by s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, or s. pyogenes were typically 4 to 20 times lower than those of vancomycin. overall, these new glycopeptides, such as ly307599 and ly333328, show promise for use as agents against resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.

TI  == the gene encoding for penicillin-binding protein 5 of enterococcus faecalis is useful for development of a species-specific dna probe.
AB  == recently, in escherichia coli was cloned a sau3ai 3.4-kb fragment containing the  gene encoding for penicillin-binding protein 5 (pbp5) of enterococcus faecalis. the structural gene for the pbp of e. faecalis and the flanking regions were entirely sequenced (c. signoretto, m. boaretti, and p. canepari, fems microbiol.  lett. 123:99-106, 1994). when the entire cloned e. faecalis dna insert, labeled with digoxigenin, was used as a probe to detect a homology gene in enterococci, it was observed that only dnas of all the e. faecalis strains reacted to the probe. the same results were obtained when a hindiii fragment of 0.35 kb from the entire insert of 3.4 kb was used. in this study we tested a total of 62 clinically isolated enterococcal strains, belonging to the species e. faecalis (36 strains), e. faecium (13), e. gallinarum (6), e. bovis (2) e. avium (3), e. hirae (1), and e. casseliflavus (1). the results indicate that both the entire segment and the hindiii fragment may be useful for preparing a species-specific probe for rapid identification of e. faecalis species.

AB  == a point prevalence culture survey was carried out to investigate the prevalence of fecal carriage of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) among patients admitted to an 800-bed general hospital where no vre had been isolated previously. twenty-two of 636 patients (3.5%) were found to be vre carriers. eighteen strains were identified as enterococcus faecium, three were identified as enterococcus gallinarum, and one was identified as enterococcus faecalis. the  susceptibilities of the enterococci to ampicillin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin were determined by the disk diffusion and the agar dilution methods. high-level resistance (hlr) to gentamicin and streptomycin was determined by the agar screening method. eighteen strains (82%) were highly resistant to vancomycin, and four strains (18%) were moderately resistant to vancomycin. five strains were susceptible to teicoplanin (23%; mics, < or = 8 micrograms/ml). only one strain (4.5%, e. faecium) showed hlr to gentamicin, and six strains (27%) showed hlr to  streptomycin (one e. faecalis and five e. faecium strains). all 18 e. faecium and 1 e. faecalis strain carried the vana gene, and 3 e. gallinarum strains carried the vanc gene. an epidemiological investigation revealed several risk factors for vre colonization: hospitalization and duration of stay in the hematology department and prior vancomycin treatment. the study demonstrates that the patient's gastrointestinal tract is a possible reservoir for vre, even in hospitals where vre infections have not yet been observed. therefore, we conclude that infection control precautions and restriction of glycopeptide usage may be key issues in limiting the emergence and spread of nosocomial vre infections.

TI  == species identification and antibiotic susceptibility of enterococci isolated from clinical specimens of hospitalized patients.
AB  == over a 4-month period, a total of 315 enterococci were isolated from various clinical specimens of hospitalized patients. by applying an array of biochemical  tests, all strains were accurately identified to the species level, and their susceptibilities to clinically relevant antibiotics were determined by a standardized agar dilution technique. e. faecalis and e. faecium accounted for 87.3% and 9.2% of isolates, respectively. e. avium (1%), e. gallinarum (1%), e. durans (0.6%), e. hirae (0.6%), and e. casseliflavus (0.3%) isolates were also identified. eleven strains of e. faecium and 1 e. hirae isolate were resistant to ampicillin, but none of the isolates produced beta-lactamase. twenty-three e. faecium and 3 e. faecalis strains as well as 1 e. hirae isolate revealed imipenem resistance. a total of 25.4% enterococci (60 e. faecalis and 19 e. faecium isolates, 1 e. hirae strain) were erythromycin-resistant. twelve strains (11 e. faecium and 1 e. avium) exhibited ciprofloxacin resistance. high-level resistance to streptomycin was found in 58 (21.1%) e. faecalis, 9 (31%) e. faecium, and both e. hirae strains, whereas high-level gentamicin resistance (hlgr) was exclusively seen in the species e. faecalis (11.6% of isolates belonging to this species). a  simple agar screening test containing 500 micrograms of gentamicin per ml proved  to be highly reliable for detection of hlgr. the structural gene coding for hlgr  was specifically amplified by the polymerase chain reaction in all isolates showing this resistance trait. moreover, the gene was specifically detected by a  nonradioactively labelled oligonucleotide probe in colony blot hybridization assays, indicating the potential application of these molecular approaches as a diagnostic tool.

AB  == enterococci isolated from a large variety of fresh and prepared foods of animal origin during routine microbiologic control tests in a distribution firm, were identified to species level using api 20 strep galleries supplemented with conventional tests, rapid id32 strep galleries and sds-page analysis. api 20 strep tests correctly identified 77% of the strains, mainly enterococcus faecium  and e. faecalis. a simple presumptive identification scheme based on pigmentation, tetrazolium reduction and acid production from mannitol and raffinose identified 90% of the strains. more complex procedures were necessary to identify the remaining strains. nearly all strains isolated from hard cheeses  and prepared cheese-meat combinations were identified as e. faecium while e. faecalis was the most frequent species in crustaceans. in meat and in prepared meat products e. faecium, e. faecalis and less frequently e. hirae/e. durans were found. three of four e. gallinarum strains were isolated from products containing turkey meat.

TI  == investigation of the reformulated remel synergy quad plate for detection of high-level aminoglycoside and vancomycin resistance among enterococci.
AB  == we investigated the accuracy of the recently released remel synergy quad plate, a commercially available agar screening method for detecting high-level aminoglycoside and vancomycin resistance among enterococci that is based on the national committee for clinical laboratory standards recommended guidelines (national committee for clinical laboratory standards, m7-a3, 1993). the synergy  quad correctly determined the gentamicin and streptomycin resistance status for > or = 97% of 147 enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium isolates tested. detection of vancomycin resistance also was reliable, as no false susceptibility  occurred with 36 vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis and e. faecium strains and false resistance occurred only once with the 47 susceptible strains tested. one strain each of enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus failed to grow on the screen, but because the true nature and significance of resistance in such isolates is unknown the implication of their screen negativity is uncertain. in summary, the remel synergy quad provides a highly accurate and convenient method for susceptibility testing of enterococci against gentamicin, streptomycin, and vancomycin.

TI  == high-level gentamicin resistance among enterococci.
AB  == the bi-functional enzyme 6'-aminoglycoside acetyltransferase (aac-6')-2" aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (aph-2"), which is encoded by the 2 kb fused gene aaca-aphd, mediates gentamicin resistance in enterococcus faecalis. this gene is associated with the composite transposon tn5281 that shares extensive homology with transposons tn4001 and tn4031 found in staphylococci. typically these transposons are characterized by the resistance gene being flanked by 1.35  kb insertion sequences (is256). the resistance gene (aaca-aphd) appears identical among all e. faecalis studied, but restriction enzyme analysis indicates notable  heterogeneity within the flanking regions. various combinations of is256-like and is257-like elements, or portions thereof, have been described in different resistant isolates. as gentamicin resistance has been described in other enterococcal species (e. faecium, e. avium, e. gallinarum, e. raffinosus, e. casseliflavus) homology with the resistance gene of e. faecalis has largely been  maintained, but more extensive variations in the flanking sequences have been noted. although many similarities exist among enterococcal gentamicin resistance  determinants, heterogeneity in the flanking regions indicates that measurable divergence exists among these determinants. this divergence may be of value in characterizing the mechanisms and natural course of gentamicin resistance dissemination which now includes staphylococci, enterococci and streptococci.

AB  == a pcr assay that allows simultaneous detection of glycopeptide resistance genotypes and identification to the species level of clinically relevant enterococci (enterococcus faecium, e. faecalis, e. gallinarum, and e. casseliflavus) was developed. this assay was based on specific amplification of internal fragments of genes encoding d-alanine:d-alanine ligases and related glycopeptide resistance proteins. the specificity of the assay was tested on 5 well-characterized glycopeptide-resistant strains and on 15 susceptible enterococcal type strains. clinical isolates of enterococci that could not be identified to the species level by conventional methods were identified by the pcr test. this assay offers a specific and rapid alternative to antibiotic susceptibility tests, in particular for detection of low-level vancomycin resistance.

TI  == the vanb gene confers various levels of self-transferable resistance to vancomycin in enterococci.
AB  == thirty-nine strains of enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis resistant to vancomycin and susceptible to teicoplanin on disk susceptibility testing (phenotypic class b) were isolated in 15 hospitals in europe and the united states. the mics of vancomycin for these strains ranged from 4 to 1024 micrograms/ml. part of the vancomycin resistance gene vanb from e. faecalis v583  hybridized with a single but variably sized hindiii-kpni fragment of total dna from all 39 strains. this indicates that a single class of resistance determinants accounts for the vanb phenotype. no hybridization was detected with  dna from intrinsically resistant enterococcus gallinarum or enterococcus casseliflavus. hybridization with dna from enterococcal strains susceptible to or with acquired resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin was not observed. the genes conferring resistance to vancomycin were self-transferable to other enterococcus strains in 14 of the 39 strains. it thus appears that vanb confers various levels of conjugative vancomycin resistance in enterococci.

TI  == occurrence and mechanisms of glycopeptide resistance in gram-positive cocci.
AB  == despite belief that the unique mechanism of glycopeptide action would preclude the development of resistance in susceptible organisms, clinical isolates of enterococci and staphylococci resistant to these compounds have been described. among the enterococci, there are at least three types of resistance. type a (high-level) resistance was described in enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis. it is inducible and mediated by elaboration and/or increased activity of at least three enzymes: a ligase, a dehydrogenase, and a carboxypeptidase, which orchestrate the production of peptidoglycan precursors that do not bind vancomycin. type b (low-level) resistance described in e. faecium is also mediated by increased carboxypeptidase activity and, possibly, by elaboration of  a protein detectable after incubation in vancomycin whose function is unknown. type c resistance is associated with production of a ligase constitutively produced, chromosomally encoded, and unique to e. gallinarum. among the staphylococci, coagulase-negative clinical isolates were obtained that were resistant to glycopeptides and one coagulase-positive isolate was resistant to teicoplanin but the mechanism of resistance is unknown. additionally, coagulase-positive staphylococci resistant to glycopeptides have been prepared in the laboratory. they produce an approximately 39-kda cytoplasmic protein, whose function is unknown, and have undergone extensive reorganization of their cell surface. the era in which universal gram-positive susceptibility to glycopeptides can be presumed is over; susceptibility testing must now accompany isolation of an enterococcus or staphylococcus of clinical importance.

AB  == since 1988, when the first vancomycin-resistant enterococcus was described, several descriptions of failures of disk diffusion breakpoints to detect low-level vancomycin resistance (mics, 8 to 32 micrograms/ml) have been published. a four-laboratory collaborative study was undertaken to establish more accurate breakpoints for the disk test. mueller-hinton agar was used to perform dilution testing (in three laboratories) and disk diffusion testing (in all laboratories). results were determined at 18, 24, and 48 h, and zones of inhibition were read using both transmitted and reflected light. one hundred organisms (35 enterococcus faecalis, 55 e. faecium, and 10 e. gallinarum or e. casseliflavus isolates) were selected to represent vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant phenotypes. interlaboratory agreement of agar dilution mics was better at 24 h (91 to 94% within +/- 1 dilution) than at 18 h (76% within +/- 1 dilution). therefore, 24-h agar dilution mic results were used as the reference.  for disk diffusion, it was critical to note the presence of a haze or colonies inside the zone when interpreting the test, since this correlated better with the results of the agar dilution test. the presence of a haze or inner colonies was best detected by reading the zones with transmitted light and incubating the plates for a full 24 h. when plotted against 24-h agar dilution mics, breakpoints of </= 14 mm (resistant), 15 to 16 mm (intermediate), and >/= 17 mm (susceptible) resulted in 58 minor errors (14.5% of total values) and 5 very major errors (2.2% of resistant values or 1.3% of total values). no major errors were seen. results  of repeat testing using a common lot of mueller-hinton agar showed 52 minor errors (13.3%) and 4 major errors (4.2% of susceptible values of 1.0% pf total values) but no very major errors. it is recommended that any haze or colonies within the zone be taken into account when determining zones of inhibition and that an mic test be performed for strains with intermediate zones if vancomycin is being considered for treatment.

AB  == we collected 705 isolates of enterococci (1 per patient) from cultures of a variety of anatomic sites from patients at eight tertiary-care hospitals in six geographic regions of the united states. a total of 632 (90%) enterococcus faecalis, 58 (8%) e. faecium, 5 e. gallinarum, 4 e. avium, 3 e. casseliflavus, 1  e. raffinosus, and 1 e. hirae isolate and 1 biochemical variant of e. faecalis were identified; 606 (86%) of these isolates were associated with clinical infections. the most common sites of isolation were the urinary tract (402 [57%]), nonsurgical wounds (94 [13%]), the bloodstream (74 [10%]), and surgical wounds (62 [9%]). high-level resistance to gentamicin or streptomycin or both was detected in 265 (38%) of the isolates. we identified two e. faecalis isolates resistant to vancomycin (mics, 32 and 128 micrograms/ml) and 11 beta-lactamase-producing e. faecalis isolates. e. faecium isolates were significantly more resistant than e. faecalis isolates to penicillin, ampicillin, piperacillin, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin (p less than 0.001). the mics for the 15 non-e. faecalis, non-e. faecium enterococci indicated variable resistance to ciprofloxacin and the penicillins. antimicrobial susceptibility patterns vary among species of enterococci, and these organisms, while commonly resistant to high-level aminoglycosides, can also acquire resistance to vancomycin or the ability to produce beta-lactamase. because of these diverse antimicrobial resistance mechanisms, successful treatment and control of enterococcal infections with current antimicrobial agents are becoming increasingly difficult.

TI  == effects of amino acids on expression of enterococcal vancomycin resistance.
AB  == the effects of various amino acids on vancomycin mics obtained with resistant enterococci was investigated by using broth dilution testing. for both the type a (i.e., possessing transferable resistance to teicoplanin and vancomycin) and the  type b (i.e., possessing teicoplanin susceptibility and nontransferable vancomycin resistance) resistant strains, vancomycin mics in the presence of glycine were substantially lower than those in unsupplemented broth (range of mic decrease, 8- to 128-fold). no such effect was seen with enterococcus gallinarum aib-39 or with the susceptible control enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212. further  testing of two type b strains (e. faecalis v583 and v583-2) showed that certain other amino acids (i.e., d-methionine, d-serine, d-alanine, and d-phenylalanine)  had effects similar to that of glycine. results of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with membrane preparations from these  strains revealed the production of vancomycin-inducible proteins of sizes comparable to those describe for other enterococcal isolates that exhibit acquired vancomycin resistance. even in the presence of 0.2 m glycine, the inducible proteins were produced. these results indicate that certain amino acids specifically interfere with the mechanism(s) of acquired vancomycin resistance in enterococci and that the nature of interference probably involves inhibition or circumvention of the inducible proteins' functions.

TI  == detection of high-level aminoglycoside resistance in enterococci other than enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == the ability of six screening methods to detect high-level aminoglycoside resistance in enterococcal species other than enterococcus faecalis was investigated. the 85 enterococcus isolates, which included 55 e. faecium, 11 e. gallinarum, 9 e. casseliflavus, 5 e. raffinosus, 4 e. avium, and 1 e. mundtii, were tested by using aminoglycoside-supplemented brain heart infusion agar (bhi), remel ef synergy quad plates, high-content aminoglycoside diffusion disks, standard (prepared in-house) microdilution panels, pasco mic gram positive microdilution panels, and vitek gps-ta cards. when tested on bhi, 32 and 35 strains showed resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin, respectively. resistance profiles obtained with remel ef synergy quad plates were in complete agreement with those obtained on bhi. however, growth on mueller-hinton agar-based plates was not as heavy. some isolates showed only weak growth and required 48 h for resistance to become evident, especially with swab inoculation  of quadrants containing 2,000 micrograms of gentamicin per ml. profiles obtained  by use of the agar-based screens were used as the basis for evaluating the other  methods. disk diffusion showed complete agreement. no false resistance occurred by either microdilution method, but 48 h of incubation was needed for detection of some gentamicin-resistant isolates, and 14% of the streptomycin-resistant strains were not detected by standard microdilution. the vitek gps-ta card detected 81 and 100% of the gentamicin- and streptomycin-resistant isolates, respectively. in general, most methods used to detect high-level aminoglycoside resistance in e. faecalis appear to be reliable for the testing of the other enterococcal species. however, further investigations with a greater number of resistant e. raffinosus, e. avium, and e. mundtii isolates, when they are available, will be useful for establishing the full range of enterococci that can reliably be tested by the various methods.

TI  == recovery of vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci from pediatric liver transplant recipients.
AB  == between november 1988 and october 1989, 49 first-time pediatric liver transplant  recipients at the children's hospital of pittsburgh were prospectively monitored  for the presence of stool colonization and the development of disease caused by vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci (vrgpc). quantitative stool culturing was done on a weekly basis, and cultures were planted onto a selective medium for vrgpc. isolates for which the mic was greater than or equal to 8 were considered  resistant to vancomycin. patients were monitored clinically for the development of infection, and their charts were systematically reviewed for the use of antibiotics. eighty-six isolates were recovered from 36 of the 49 patients. enterococcal species were isolated from 31 patients and included enterococcus gallinarum (n = 28), e. casseliflavus (n = 14), e. faecium (n = 9), e. faecalis (n = 2), e. mundtii (n = 2), and e. durans (n = 1). stool colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci was noted to increase steadily during the first  month after transplantation. only 9 of 31 patients demonstrated clearance of these organisms in serial repeat cultures. additional isolates of vrgpc included  lactobacillus confusus (n = 13), lactobacillus spp. (n = 12), and pediococcus pentosaceus (n = 4). infection due to vrgpc developed in three patients: a urinary tract infection in two and peritonitis in one. e. faecium was the pathogen in each of these cases. the ranges of mics of vancomycin were 8 to 32 micrograms/ml for all enterococcal isolates and greater than 128 micrograms/ml for lactobacillus and pediococcus isolates. all lactobacillus and pediococcus isolates were resistant to teicoplanin, although they were susceptible to daptomycin. all other isolates were susceptible to both teicoplanin and daptomycin. this study demonstrates that stool colonization with vrgpc may be a common and early finding among pediatric liver transplant recipients. however, infection appears to be uncommon.

TI  == composition of the enterococcal and streptococcal intestinal flora of poultry.
AB  == identification to species level showed that enterococcus faecalis and ent. faecium largely dominated the enterococcal and streptococcal gut flora of 1-d-old chicks. enterococcus faecalis was rare in 3- to 5-week-old broilers. two species, ent. faecium and streptococcus alactolyticus, were isolated from nearly all broilers examined. enterococcus hirae and ent. durans were found in the small intestines of this category of poultry. in layers and parent stock of over 12 weeks of age, ent. cecorum dominated with strep. alactolyticus ranking next. other species were isolated irregularly. enterococcus avium and ent. gallinarum,  originally described from chickens, were rarely found. these species did not appear to belong to the normal intestinal flora of poultry.

TI  == synergistic killing of vancomycin-resistant enterococci of classes a, b, and c by combinations of vancomycin, penicillin, and gentamicin.
AB  == using both high and low inocula for time-kill curves, we examined the antibiotic  killing of clinical isolates of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (enterococcus  faecium, e. faecalis, and e. gallinarum) belonging to phenotypic resistance classes a, b, and c. none were resistant to high levels (greater than 500 mg/liter) of gentamicin. vancomycin-penicillin-gentamicin resulted in 2 or more logs of killing above that of the most effective two-antibiotic combination for all strains except two of three e. gallinarum (vanc) strains and a constitutive mutant of a vanb strain. this strategy may be useful clinically.

TI  == intrageneric relationships of enterococci as determined by reverse transcriptase  sequencing of small-subunit rrna.
AB  == the 16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rrna) sequences of eleven enterococcus species were determined by reverse transcription in an attempt to clarify their intrageneric relationships. comparative analysis of the sequence data revealed the presence of several species groups within the genus. the species e. avium, e. malodoratus, e. pseudoavium and e. raffinosus formed a distinct group as did e. durans, e. faecium, e. hirae and e. mundtii and the pair of species e. casseliflavus and e. gallinarum. of the remaining species, e. cecorum, e. columbae, e. faecalis and e. saccharolyticus formed distinct lines of descent within the genus, whereas e. solitarius displayed a closer affinity with tetragenococcus halophilus than with other enterococcal species.

TI  == in vitro detection of enterococcal vancomycin resistance.
AB  == by using agar dilution as the standard method, we determined the ability of broth microdilution, disk diffusion, and an automated system (ams vitek) to detect three different levels of vancomycin resistance among six enterococcal isolates.  enterococcus gallinarum aib-38 and aib-39 exhibited low-level resistance (mic, 16 to 32 micrograms/ml) that was detected only by agar and broth dilution methods. e. faecalis v583, e. faecium aib-42, and e. faecalis aib-41 showed moderately high-level resistance (mic, 128 to 256 micrograms/ml) that was detected by dilution methods but not by disk diffusion unless prolonged incubation or an inoculum 10-fold greater than the standard was used. similarly, this level of resistance was detected by ams vitek only when an inoculum 10-fold larger than recommended was used. the high resistance demonstrated by e. faecium aib-40 (mic, 2,048 micrograms/ml) was readily detected by all methods studied. variation in the ability of different methods to detect vancomycin resistance among enterococci complicates monitoring the incidence of these organisms and could result in very major susceptibility reporting errors.

TI  == species identities of enterococci isolated from clinical specimens.
AB  == conventional tests and commercially available systems were used to determine the  species identities of clinical isolates of enterococci. strict adherence to the conventional test scheme of facklam and collins (r. r. facklam and m. d. collins, j. clin. microbiol. 27:731-734, 1989) resulted in the misidentification of lactose-negative enterococcus faecalis isolates as enterococcus solitarius, but this problem was overcome by the application of additional tests. the commercially available systems tested were unable to recognize some of the more recently described enterococcal species. e. faecalis accounted for 87.1% of 302 consecutive isolates. enterococcus faecium (8.6%), enterococcus avium (0.7%), enterococcus durans (0.3%), enterococcus gallinarum (1.0%), enterococcus casseliflavus (1.0%), enterococcus hirae (0.3%), and enterococcus raffinosus (0.3%) isolates were also identified. none of the isolates produced beta-lactamase, but 15.4% of 235 isolates tested, including 1 strain of e. gallinarum, displayed high-level resistance to gentamicin.

TI  == the effect of growth-promoting antibiotics on the faecal enterococci of healthy young chickens.
AB  == small groups of chickens were given feed containing either avoparcin, nitrovin, virginiamycin or zinc bacitracin from the day of their purchase as day-olds. differences between the birds receiving growth promoters and the untreated controls were observed during the last third of the 23 d survey period. the enterococcal population of the 'dosed' birds contained a greater proportion of enterococcus faecium than did that of the control birds while the converse was true for ent. gallinarum. this apparent selection of ent. faecium by the growth-promoting antibiotics had an influence on the incidence of resistance to therapeutic antibiotics among the enterococcal population as a whole. this was because this species was generally more resistant than ent. gallinarum to cephalothin, the mls antibiotics (erythromycin, lincomycin and tylosin) and tetracycline.

TI  == the effect of ampicillin and tylosin on the faecal enterococci of healthy young chickens.
AB  == enterococcal isolates from young chickens were differentiated into one of three species, namely enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium and ent. gallinarum. the proportion of each species among the enterococcal population changed with time in birds not dosed with antibiotics. this pattern of change was modified in birds dosed with either tylosin or ampicillin even though ampicillin did not select for ampicillin resistance among the enterococcal population. a gradual increase in tylosin resistance was recorded with time among the enterococci of the 'undosed'  control birds. this was associated with an increase in the proportion of ent. faecium, a species commonly resistant to tylosin, among the enterococci of the birds as they grew older.

TI  == use of penicillin-binding proteins for the identification of enterococci.
AB  == the results of 20 physiological and fermentation tests and examination of the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of 85 enterococcal strains demonstrated that the genus enterococcus could be divided into at least nine distinct species: e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. durans, e. hirae, e. avium, e. gallinarum, e. casseliflavus, e. malodoratus and e. mundtii. each species had a specific pattern of at least five pbps, with molecular masses in the range of about 40-130 kda. the pattern of pbps may be useful for identification purposes, since some strains with unusual fermentation characteristics were assigned to species by this technique.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of streptococcus.
AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. the major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (s. faecalis, s. faecium, 's. avium' and a proposed new species 's. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (s. bovis, s. equinus, s. salivarius, 's. casseliflavus', s. mutans, s. raffinolactis and an unidentified oral group i); (c) lactic species group (s. lactis including s. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (s. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (s. mitis, s. sanguis, a proposed new species 's. oralis' and 's. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. equi, 's. equisimilis' including 's. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of lancefield group b strains of human origin);  (g) parapyogenic species group (s. uberis, 's. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of lancefield groups r, s and t). species of aerococcus, gemella, leuconostoc and pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
