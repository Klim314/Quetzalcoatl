TI  == short communication: comparison of ph, volatile fatty acids, and microbiome of rumen samples from preweaned calves obtained via cannula or stomach tube.
AB  == the objective of this study was to compare rumen samples from young dairy calves  obtained via a stomach tube (st) or a ruminal cannula (rc). five male holstein calves (46+/-4.0 kg of body weight and 11+/-4.9 d of age) were ruminally cannulated at 15 d of age. calves received 4 l/d of a commercial milk replacer (25% crude protein and 19.2% fat) at 12.5% dry matter, and were provided concentrate and chopped oats hay ad libitum throughout the study (56 d). in total, 29 paired rumen samples were obtained weekly throughout the study in most  of the calves by each extraction method. these samples were used to determine ph  and volatile fatty acids (vfa) concentration, and to quantify prevotella ruminicola and streptococcus bovis by quantitative pcr. furthermore, a denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was performed on rumen samples harvested during wk 8 of the study to determine the degree of similarity between rumen bacteria communities. rumen ph was 0.30 units greater in st compared with rc samples. furthermore, total vfa concentrations were greater in rc than in st samples. however, when analyzing the proportion of each vfa by anova, no differences were  found between the sampling methods. the quantification of s. bovis and p. ruminicola was similar in both extraction methods, and values obtained using different methods were highly correlated (r(2)=0.89 and 0.98 for s. bovis and p.  ruminicola, respectively). fingerprinting analysis showed similar bacteria band profiles between samples obtained from the same calves using different extraction methods. in conclusion, when comparing rumen parameters obtained using different  sampling techniques, it is recommended that vfa profiles be used rather than total vfa concentrations, as total vfa concentrations are more affected by the method of collection. furthermore, although comparisons of ph across studies should be avoided when samples are not obtained using the same sampling method, the comparison of fingerprinting of a bacteria community or a specific rumen bacterium is valid.

TI  == effects of soybean small peptides on rumen fermentation and on intestinal and total tract digestion of luxi yellow cattle.
AB  == four luxi beef cattle (400+/-10 kg) fitted with ruminal, duodenal and ileal cannulas were used in a 4x4 latin square to assess the effects of soybean small peptide (ssp) infusion on rumen fermentation, diet digestion and flow of nutrient in the gastrointestinal tract. the ruminal infusion of ssp was 0 (control), 100,  200 and 300 g/d. ruminal ssp infusion linearly (p<0.01) and quadratically (p<0.01) increased microbial protein synthesis and rumen ammonia-n concentration. concentrations of total volatile fatty acid were linearly increased (p = 0.029) by infusion ssp. rumen samples were obtained for analysis of microbial ecology by real-time pcr. populations of rumen butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, streptococcus bovis, ciliate protozoa, ruminococcus flavefaciens, and prevotella ruminicola were expressed as a proportion of total rumen bacterial 16s ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rdna). butyrivibrio fibrisolvens populations which related to total bacterial 16s rdna were increased (p<0.05), while streptococcus bovis populations were linearly (p = 0.049) and quadratically (p = 0.020) decreased by  infusion of ssp. apparent rumen digestibility of dm and ndf were (q, p<0.05; l, p<0.05) increased with infusion ssp. total tract digestion of dm, om and ndf were linearly (p<0.01) and quadratically (p<0.01) increased by infusing ssp. the flow  of total amino acids (aa), essential amino acids (eaa) and individual amino acids were linearly (p<0.01) and quadratically (p<0.01) increased with infusion ssp. the digestibility of lysine was quadratically (p = 0.033) increased and apparent  degradability of arginine was linearly (p = 0.032) and quadratically (p = 0.042)  increased with infusion ssp. the results indicated that infusion ssp could improve nutrient digestion, ruminal fermentation and aa availability.

TI  == anaerobic bioremediation of rdx by ovine whole rumen fluid and pure culture isolates.
AB  == the ability of ruminal microbes to degrade the explosive compound hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (rdx) in ovine whole rumen fluid (wrf) and as 24 bacterial isolates was examined under anaerobic conditions. compound degradation was monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identification of metabolites. organisms in wrf microcosms degraded 180 mum rdx within 4 h. nitroso-intermediates hexahydro-1-nitroso-3,5-dinitro-1,3,5-triazine (mnx), hexahydro-1,3-dinitroso-5-nitro-1,3,5-triazine (dnx), and hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitroso-1,3,5-triazine (tnx) were present as early as 0.25 h and were detected throughout the 24-h incubation period, representing one reductive pathway of ring cleavage. following reduction to mnx, peaks consistent  with m/z 193 and 174 were also produced, which were unstable and resulted in rapid ring cleavage to a common metabolite consistent with an m/z of 149. these represent two additional reductive pathways for rdx degradation in ovine wrf, which have not been previously reported. the 24 ruminal isolates degraded rdx with varying efficiencies (0-96 %) over 120 h. of the most efficient degraders identified, clostridium polysaccharolyticum and desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans degraded rdx when medium was supplemented with both nitrogen and carbon, while anaerovibrio lipolyticus, prevotella ruminicola, and streptococcus bovis ifo utilized rdx as a sole source of nitrogen. this study showed that organisms in whole rumen fluid, as well as several ruminal isolates,  have the ability to degrade rdx in vitro and, for the first time, delineated the  metabolic pathway for its biodegradation.

TI  == description of development of rumen ecosystem by pcr assay in milk-fed, weaned and finished lambs in an intensive fattening system.
AB  == this study examined the reticulo-rumen characteristics of the microbial community and its fermentative characteristics in milk-fed, at weaning and finished lambs in a conventional fattening system. five lambs were assigned to each of three groups: milk-fed lambs slaughtered at 30 days (t30), weaned lambs slaughtered at  45 days (t45) and 'finished lambs' slaughtered at 90 days (t90). at slaughter, rumen size, fermentation parameters (ph, volatile fatty acids and microbial enzyme activity) and protozoal counts were recorded. quantitative pcr was used to quantify the genes encoding 16s and 18s ribosomal dna of the rumen bacterial and  protozoal populations, respectively, and the sequential colonization of the rumen by cellulolytic (ruminococcus albus, ruminococcus flavefaciens) and amylolytic (prevotella ruminicola, streptococcus bovis) bacteria, and protozoa (entodinium sp.). denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to study the development of rumen microbiota biodiversity. intake of solid food before weaning caused a significant increase in rumen weight (p < 0.0001) and bacterial dna (p < 0.05) and volatile fatty acid analysis concentration (p < 0.01), whereas ph declined. in milk-fed lambs, cellulolytic bacteria were evident after 30 days. thereafter,  in the 45-day and 90-day groups, the proportions of r. flavefaciens decreased and r. albus increased. amylolytic bacteria were present in milk-fed lambs; the proportion of p. ruminicola increased in fattening lambs and s. bovis was the least abundant species. protozoal concentrations were irregular; milk-fed lambs had a significant number of protozoa species from entodinium and subfamily isotrichiidae, but they disappeared at weaning. lamb rumen were refaunated in some individuals at 90 days (entodinium and subfamily diplodiniinae spp.), although individual concentrations were variable.

TI  == rumen microbiome composition determined using two nutritional models of subacute  ruminal acidosis.
AB  == subacute ruminal acidosis (sara) is a metabolic disease in dairy cattle that occurs during early and mid-lactation and has traditionally been characterized by low rumen ph, but lactic acid does not accumulate as in acute lactic acid acidosis. it is hypothesized that factors such as increased gut permeability, bacterial lipopolysaccharides, and inflammatory responses may have a role in the  etiology of sara. however, little is known about the nature of the rumen microbiome during sara. in this study, we analyzed the microbiome of 64 rumen samples taken from eight lactating holstein dairy cattle using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (trflp) of 16s rrna genes and real-time pcr. we used rumen samples from two published experiments in which sara had been  induced with either grain or alfalfa pellets. the results of trflp analysis indicated that the most predominant shift during sara was a decline in gram-negative bacteroidetes organisms. however, the proportion of bacteroidetes organisms was greater in alfalfa pellet-induced sara than in mild or severe grain-induced sara (35.4% versus 26.0% and 16.6%, respectively). this shift was also evident from the real-time pcr data for prevotella albensis, prevotella brevis, and prevotella ruminicola, which are members of the bacteroidetes. the real-time pcr data also indicated that severe grain-induced sara was dominated by streptococcus bovis and escherichia coli, whereas mild grain-induced sara was dominated by megasphaera elsdenii and alfalfa pellet-induced sara was dominated by p. albensis. using discriminant analysis, the severity of sara and degree of inflammation were highly correlated with the abundance of e. coli and not with lipopolysaccharide in the rumen. we thus suspect that e. coli may be a contributing factor in disease onset.

TI  == biotransformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by pure culture ruminal bacteria.
AB  == twenty-one ruminal bacteria species were tested for their ability to degrade 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (tnt) within 24 h. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, fibrobacter succinogenes, lactobacillus vitulinus, selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus caprinus, and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with <5% of the original tnt recovered as diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. eubacterium ruminantium, lactobacillus ruminis, ruminobacter amylophilus, streptococcus bovis, and wolinella succinogenes were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with 23-60% of the tnt recovered as aminodinitrotoluene and/or diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. clostridium polysaccharolyticum, megasphaera elsdenii, prevotella bryantii, prevotella ruminicola, ruminococcus albus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens were able to degrade 80-90% of 100 mg/l tnt. desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans, prevotella albensis, and treponema bryantii degraded 50-80% of the tnt. anaerovibrio lipolytica was completely inhibited by 100 mg/l tnt. these results indicate that a variety of rumen bacteria is capable of transforming tnt.

TI  == dominance of prevotella and low abundance of classical ruminal bacterial species  in the bovine rumen revealed by relative quantification real-time pcr.
AB  == relative quantification real-time pcr was used to quantify several bacterial species in ruminal samples from two lactating cows, each sampled 3 h after feeding on two successive days. abundance of each target taxon was calculated as  a fraction of the total 16s rrna gene copies in the samples, using taxon-specific and eubacterial domain-level primers. bacterial populations showed a clear predominance of members of the genus prevotella, which comprised 42% to 60% of the bacterial rrna gene copies in the samples. however, only 2% to 4% of the bacterial rrna gene copies were represented by the classical ruminal prevotella species prevotella bryantii, prevotella ruminicola and prevotella brevis. the proportion of rrna gene copies attributable to fibrobacter succinogenes, ruminococcus flavefaciens, selenomonas ruminantium and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were each generally in the 0.5% to 1% range. proportions for ruminobacter amylophilus and eubacterium ruminantium were lower (0.1% to 0.2%), while butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, streptococcus bovis, ruminococcus albus and megasphaera elsdenii were even less abundant, each comprising <0.03% of the bacterial rrna gene copies. the data suggest that the aggregate abundance of the  most intensively studied ruminal bacterial species is relatively low and that a large fraction of the uncultured population represents a single bacterial genus.

TI  == in vitro bacterial growth and in vivo ruminal microbiota populations associated with bloat in steers grazing wheat forage.
AB  == the role of ruminal bacteria in the frothy bloat complex common to cattle grazing winter wheat has not been previously determined. two experiments, one in vitro and another in vivo, were designed to elucidate the effects of fresh wheat forage on bacterial growth, biofilm complexes, rumen fermentation end products, rumen bacterial diversity, and bloat potential. in exp. 1, 6 strains of ruminal bacteria (streptococcus bovis strain 26, prevotella ruminicola strain 23, eubacterium ruminantium b1c23, ruminococcus albus sy3, fibrobacter succinogenes ssp. s85, and ruminococcus flavefaciens c94) were used in vitro to determine the  effect of soluble plant protein from winter wheat forage on specific bacterial growth rate, biofilm complexes, vfa, and ruminal h2 and ch4 in mono or coculture  with methanobrevibacter smithii. the specific growth rate in plant protein medium containing soluble plant protein (3.27% nitrogen) was measured during a 24-h incubation at 39 degrees c in hungate tubes under a co2 gas phase. a monoculture  of m. smithii was grown similarly, except under h2:co2 (1:1), in a basal methanogen growth medium supplemented likewise with soluble plant protein. in exp. 2, 6 ruminally cannulated steers grazing wheat forage were used to evaluate  the influence of bloat on the production of biofilm complexes, ruminal microbial  biodiversity patterns, and ruminal fluid protein fractions. in exp. 1, cultures of r. albus (p < 0.01) and r. flavefaciens (p < 0.05) produced the most h2 among  strains and resulted in greater (p < 0.01) ch4 production when cocultured with m. smithii than other coculture combinations. cultures of s. bovis and e. ruminantium + m. smithii produced the most biofilm mass among strains. in exp. 2, when diets changed from bermudagrass hay to wheat forage, biofilm production increased (p < 0.01). biofilm production, concentrations of whole ruminal content (p < 0.01), and cheesecloth filtrate protein fractions (p < 0.05) in the ruminal  fluid were greater on d 50 for bloated than for nonbloated steers when grazing wheat forage. the molecular analysis of the 16s rdna showed that 2 different ruminal microbiota populations developed between bloated and nonbloated animals grazing wheat forage. bloat in cattle grazing wheat pastures may be caused by increased production of biofilm, resulting from a diet-influenced switch in the rumen bacterial population.

TI  == influence of dipeptidyl peptidase inhibitors on growth, peptidase activity, and ammonia production by ruminal microorganisms.
AB  == the aim was to investigate known and potential new inhibitiors of dipeptidyl peptidases (dpp) for their effects on ruminal microorganisms. gly-phe diazomethylketone (gpd), ala-ala chloromethylketone (aac), benserazide (dl-serine 2-(2,3,4- trihydroxybenzyl) hydrazide), and diprotin a (ile-pro-ile) inhibited dpp activities of prevotella albensis, p. ruminicola, p. bryantii, p. brevis, and mixed ruminal microorganisms, though incompletely and, except for diprotin a, without absolute specificity for any of the peptidases. leucine aminopeptidase activity of streptococcus bovis was also inhibited by gpd and benserazide. the inhibitors had no effect on the growth of the bacteria, except for gpd, which inhibited growth of p. albensis when only peptides were available for growth. benserazide had some inhibitory effects on the growth of megasphaera elsdenii and prevotella spp., even in the absence of peptides. the predatory activity of ciliate protozoa on bacteria was unaffected by dpp inhibitors. ammonia production from casein by mixed ruminal microorganisms was inhibited significantly (p < 0.05) by aac (29% inhibition) and benserazide (33%). it was concluded that dpp inhibitors can influence the rate of nh3 production in the rumen and may form the basis for developing protein-sparing feed additives for ruminants.

TI  == culture-independent identification of pathogenic bacteria and polymicrobial infections in the genitourinary tract of renal transplant recipients.
AB  == renal transplant recipients are predisposed to urinary tract infections caused by both common uropathogens and opportunistic bacteria resulting frequently in significant polymicrobial infections. in this study, a culture-independent 16s rrna-based approach was established to identify unusual, fastidious, or anaerobic bacteria and to investigate bacterial diversity in urinary tract specimens. similarly sized amplicons encompassing the v6 to v8 region of the 16s rrna were analyzed with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dhplc) (wave system). artificial mixtures of single amplicons from commonly encountered uropathogenic bacteria produced distinct peak profiles whose identities were confirmed by sequencing individually collected peak products. we evaluated the application of the method on 109 urinary tract specimens from renal transplant recipients; 100% correlation was found for culture-positive specimens, and dhplc  generated peak profiles. however, for culture-negative specimens, dhplc facilitated the detection of novel peak profiles. dna sequencing of these individual peaks was used to identify the bacteria involved. thus, in pcr-positive but culture-negative samples the method allowed detection of previously known uropathogens such as corynebacterium urealyticum and gardnerella vaginalis, but also unusual agents including anaerococcus lactolyticus, bacteroides vulgatus, dialister invisus, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus iners, leptotrichia amnionii, prevotella buccalis, prevotella ruminicola, rahnella aquatilis, and streptococcus intermedius were detected as single pathogens or as constituents of polymicrobial infections. the method described is reproducible and rapidly and enables both dhplc-based profiling and sequence-based investigation of microbial communities and polymicrobial infections. a detailed understanding of infections found in recipients of renal transplants will guide antibiotic therapy regimens and provide new perspectives for decreasing the risk of graft rejection.

TI  == diet-dependent shifts in the bacterial population of the rumen revealed with real-time pcr.
AB  == a set of pcr primers was designed and validated for specific detection and quantification of prevotella ruminicola, prevotella albensis, prevotella bryantii, fibrobacter succinogenes, selenomonas ruminantium-mitsuokella multiacida, streptococcus bovis, ruminococcus flavefaciens, ruminobacter amylophilus, eubacterium ruminantium, treponema bryantii, succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, and anaerovibrio lipolytica. by using these primers and the real-time pcr technique, the corresponding species in the rumens of cows for which the diet was switched from hay to grain were quantitatively monitored. the  dynamics of two fibrolytic bacteria, f. succinogenes and r. flavefaciens, were in agreement with those of earlier, culture-based experiments. the quantity of f. succinogenes dna, predominant in animals on the hay diet, fell 20-fold on the third day of the switch to a grain diet and further declined on day 28, with a 57-fold reduction in dna. the r. flavefaciens dna concentration on day 3 declined to approximately 10% of its initial value in animals on the hay diet and remained at this level on day 28. during the transition period (day 3), the quantities of  two ruminal prevotella dnas increased considerably: that of p. ruminicola increased 7-fold and that of p. bryantii increased 263-fold. on day 28, the quantity of p. ruminicola dna decreased 3-fold, while p. bryantii dna was still elevated 10-fold in comparison with the level found in animals on the initial hay diet. the dna specific for another xylanolytic bacterium, e. ruminantium, dropped 14-fold during the diet switch and was maintained at this level on day 28. the concentration of a rumen spirochete, t. bryantii, decreased less profoundly and stabilized with a sevenfold decline by day 28. the variations in a. lipolytica dna were not statistically significant. after an initial slight increase in s. dextrinosolvens dna on day 3, this dna was not detected at the end of the experiment. s. bovis dna displayed a 67-fold increase during the transition period on day 3. however, on day 28, it actually declined in comparison with the  level in animals on the hay ration. the amount of s. ruminantium-m. multiacida dna also increased eightfold following the diet switch, but stabilized with only  a twofold increase on day 28. the real-time pcr technique also uncovered differential amplification of rumen bacterial templates with the set of universal bacterial primers. this observation may explain why some predominant rumen bacteria have not been detected in pcr-generated 16s ribosomal dna libraries.

TI  == feasibility of using total purines as a marker for ruminal bacteria.
AB  == a procedure for measuring total purine content of mixed ruminal bacteria was adapted for use in the determination of purines in pure cultures of ruminal bacteria. recovery of adenine and guanine, alone or in mixture, was quite variable. the problem was traced to solubility of the silver salt of adenine in the acid wash solution. when the precipitating solution was used as the wash, recovery of the purines was over 97%. recovery of a 1:1 mixture of adenine and guanine added to yeast rna was 100.6+/-3.2%. purine, protein, and bacterial concentrations were determined for 10 pure cultures of ruminal bacteria: butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, d16f, h10b, and h17c; fibrobacter succinogenes b21a; lachnospira multiparus d25e; lactobacillus lactis ard26e; prevotella ruminicola h15a; ruminococcus albus 7; ruminococcus flavefaciens b34b; and streptococcus bovis ard5d. the cv for the most-probable-number (mpn) assay (bacterial concentrations), purine analysis, and protein analysis were 55.86, 5.25 and 6.52%, respectively. considerable variation was found among bacterial species and strains when purine and protein concentrations were compared as the amount per individual cell. more consistent values were obtained when these components were  expressed on a dry matter basis. purine:protein ratios for the 10 pure cultures ranged from .023 to .1299, with a mean value of .0883. for samples of mixed bacteria separated from ruminal fluid, this ratio was found to average .0306, which is approximately one-third of the value for the pure cultures. the value determined for the mixed bacterial sample is similar to previously reported values. based on the ratio obtained with the pure cultures, the microbial protein flow out of the rumen has probably been overestimated in most previous reports. limited studies suggest that the samples of mixed ruminal bacteria used as a standard are probably contaminated with feed particles containing protein, which  results in lower purine:protein ratios.

TI  == gc-ms analysis of diaminopimelic acid stereoisomers and amino acid enantiomers in rumen bacteria.
AB  == the amounts and the configuration of the stereoisomers of 2,6-diaminopimelic acid (dap) and the enantiomeric content of other amino acids were determined in five individual species (fibrobacter succinogenes, streptococcus bovis, selenomonas ruminantium, prevotella ruminicola and anaerovibrio lipolytica) of rumen bacteria, and in samples of mixed rumen bacteria isolated from sheep. the separation and quantification of the dap stereoisomers was achieved by gas chromatography (gc) of trifluoroacetyl 2-propyl esters on a chirasil-l-val fused  silica column, and detection was achieved by selected ion monitoring mass spectrometry (sim-ms). no isomers of dap were detected in s. bovis and p. ruminicola, two of the bacterial isolates. ll- and dd-dap were not detected in any of the bacterial samples. as only the meso-isomer of dap was detected in these microorganisms, it was quantified by adding ll-dap as an internal standard  before the bacteria were acid-hydrolyzed. amounts of between 4.8 and 12.0 mg meso-dap per gram of bacterial dry matter (dm) were determined. the presence in the rumen bacteria of free amino acid enantiomers, extractable with 70% aqueous ethanol, were determined by gc-sim-ms; the d-amino acids were predominantly ala,  asp and glu, but there was considerable variation between the species.

TI  == strategies that ruminal bacteria use to handle excess carbohydrate.
AB  == when ruminal bacteria have insufficient nitrogen and other nutrients, excess carbohydrate can be toxic. pure cultures that are nitrogen-limited can convert only some of the excess carbohydrate to intracellular polysaccharide, but this pool can be quickly saturated. fibrobacter succinogenes cultures that have excess cellobiose secrete glucose and cellotriose into the culture medium, and prevotella ruminicola produces methylglyoxal, a highly toxic substance that causes a dramatic decrease in viability. some ruminal bacteria (e.g., streptococcus bovis and selenomonas ruminantium) have mechanisms to decrease atp  production or spill the atp that has already been produced. these mechanisms of decreasing intracellular atp seem to protect the cell. most ruminal bacteria can  use ammonia as a nitrogen source, but amino nitrogen increases the growth efficiency of mixed ruminal bacteria. amino nitrogen-dependent improvements in growth efficiency can be explained by an increase in growth rate and a decrease in energy spilling. amino nitrogen is only beneficial if the rate of carbohydrate fermentation is rapid and carbohydrate is in excess.

TI  == peptidases of the rumen bacterium, prevotella ruminicola.
AB  == prevotella (formerly bacteroides) ruminicola is a numerous rumen bacterium which  plays a significant role in the metabolism of proteins and peptides in the rumen. measurement of the hydrolysis of synthetic aminopeptidase substrates by sonicated extracts and whole cells of different species of rumen bacteria indicated that p. ruminicola had the greatest range and specific activity of dipeptidyl peptidases  among the species tested. streptococcus bovis hydrolysed some dipeptidyl peptidase substrates to a lesser extent, and several species broke down ala2-p-nitroanilide, including ruminobacter amylophilus, ruminococcus spp. and veillonella parvula. dipeptidyl peptidases, which cleave dipeptides from the amino-terminus of longer peptides, were much more active than aminopeptidases removing single amino acids in p. ruminicola. ion-exchange chromatography of sonicated extracts of p. ruminicola m384 revealed at least four distinct activities: one hydrolysed ala2-p-nitroanilide, valala-p-nitroanilide, ala4and ala5; another was an o2-sensitive activity hydrolysing glyarg-4-methoxynapthylamide, argarg-4-methoxynaphthylamide, gly5 and valglyserglu, similar to dipeptidyl peptidase type i dpp-1); a third hydrolysed glypro-p-nitroanilide and glypro-4-methoxynapthylamide and was similar to dipeptidyl peptidase type iv xdpp-4); a fourth broke down lysala-4-methoxynaphthylamide. all of the enzymes, and particularly those active  against ala2-p-nitroanilide and glypro-p-nitroanilide, were inhibited by serine protease inhibitors, and all except dpp-4 were inhibited by edta. both dpp-1 and  the enzyme hydrolysing lysala-4-methoxynaphthylamide were inhibited strongly by iodoacetate. dpp-4 was inhibited completely by diprotin a. competitive inhibition experiments suggested that dpp-1 was less important than the other enzymes in the breakdown of peptide mixtures.

TI  == breakdown of peptides from a casein hydrolysate by rumen bacteria. simultaneous study of enzyme activities and physicochemical parameters.
AB  == the breakdown of a pancreatic hydrolysate of casein (tryptone) by an inoculum of  ruminal mixed bacteria was studied in vitro. peptides were degradated at 33% after 5 h. the dipeptidyl aminopeptidase type 1 (dap-1), exoaminopeptidase and leucine aminopeptidase (lap) like activities were measured using, respectively, gly-arg-mna, ala-pna and leu-pna as substrates. while the total proteolytic activity remained stable throughout peptide breakdown, the dap-1 already present  at the beginning of fermentation increased until two times its early activity. this peptidase activity is a major index for the presence of prevotella ruminicola. a peak of exoaminopeptidase and lap activities were observed at 3 h incubation. this latter activity, which was associated with the production of lactate after 3 h, suggested that streptococcus bovis was present in the environment. with the use of high-performance size exclusion chromatography (hpsec), the size of the peptides during their breakdown could be measured, showing that high molecular weight peptides (4 to 2 kda) were apparently more rapidly broken down to the profit of small-sized peptides (< 0.5 kda), which increased. these degradation abilities were closely linked to dap-1 activity. separation of tryptone peptides by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) showed that more hydrophilic peptides disappeared than hydrophobic peptides. moreover, a few peaks eluting for one in the hydrophilic area and for the others in the hydrophobic area resisted the bacterial breakdown. in contrast, amino acid profiles indicated that hydrophobic amino acids were not  taken up significantly faster than the hydrophobic amino acids by mixed ruminal bacterial.

TI  == a defined medium for rumen bacteria and identification of strains impaired in de  novo biosynthesis of certain amino acids.
AB  == a completely defined growth medium has been developed to determine the nitrogen requirements for several species of ruminal bacteria, and has revealed two strains which are impaired in de novo biosynthesis of certain amino acids. using  nh4cl as a sole nitrogen source, the medium supported growth of butyrivibrio, selenomonas, prevotella and streptococcus species. one strain of b. fibrisolvens  (e14) and one strain of p. ruminicola (ga33) did not grow in the presence of nh4cl until the medium was supplemented with amino acids or peptides. for b. fibrisolvens strain e14, methionine was identified as the specific growth-limiting amino acid although methionine alone did not support growth in the absence of nh4cl. for p. ruminicola strain ga33, any individual amino acid other than methionine or cysteine could supplement the medium and support growth. enzyme assays confirmed a lack of nadh and nadph-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) activities in this strain.

TI  == identification of proteolytic rumen bacteria isolated from new zealand cattle.
AB  == the protease activities of 212 strains of rumen bacteria isolated from new zealand cattle grazing pasture were measured. thirty-seven per cent of strains had activity greater than or equal to the proteolytic rumen bacterium prevotella  ruminicola and 43 of these isolates were identified by morphology, carbon source  utilization, gram stain, biochemical tests and fermentation end-product analysis. hierarchical cluster analysis showed that the strains formed four clusters: cluster a contained 26 strains and clustered with a reference strain of streptococcus bovis; cluster c contained three strains and clustered with a reference strain of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, while clusters b (10 strains) and  d (three strains) did not cluster with any of the remaining rumen bacterial type  strains. further tests identified strains of cluster b as eubacterium budayi, while cluster d strains most closely resembled b. fibrisolvens and were described as b. fibrisolvens-like. an unclustered strain, c21a, was identified as p. ruminicola. the significance of these proteolytic bacterial populations is discussed in relation to protein breakdown in new zealand ruminants.

AB  == streptococcus bovis jb1, prevotella ruminicola b(1)4, selenomonas ruminantium z108, fibrobacter succinogenes s85 and anaerovibrio lipolytica 5s were incubated  with either 14c-peptides (mol. wt, 200-1000) or 14c-amino acids to compare their  rates of uptake and metabolism. in experiment 1, the bacteria were grown and incubated in a complex medium, but no uptake of 14c-labelled substrates occurred. when casein digest was omitted, uptake rates of 14c-peptides were different (p <  0.01) with each species, but nil for 14c-amino acids. in experiment 2, to minimize the effects of non-radiolabelled peptides and amino acids, defined and semi-defined media were used. patterns of 14c-peptide uptake resembled those of experiment 1. the 5-min rate for strep. bovis jb1 was almost twice that of p. ruminicola b(1)4, though by 15 min they were similar and threefold greater than other species; that of a. lipolytica 5s was especially low. incubations with 14c-amino acids resulted in a wide range (p < 0.01) of uptake rates; after 5 min  p. ruminicola b(1)4 possessed the lowest and strep. bovis jb1 the highest, but after 15 min, that of sel. ruminantium z108 was even higher. all bacteria, with the exception of p. ruminicola b(1)4, assimilated 14c-amino acids faster (p < 0.01) than 14c-peptides. only strep. bovis jb1 and p. ruminicola b(1)4 were capable of extensively metabolizing 14c-peptides, but all five species metabolized 14c-amino acids; there was evidence of substantial degradation and some synthesis. calculations suggest that peptides could supply up to 43%, and amino acids 62% of the n requirements of rumen bacteria.

TI  == cyclic amp in ruminal and other anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == an examination of camp levels in predominant species of ruminal bacteria and other anaerobic bacteria was conducted. cellular camp concentrations of glucose-grown cultures of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49, prevotella ruminicola d31d, selenomonas ruminantium hd4 and d, megasphaera elsdenii b159, streptococcus bovis jb1, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron 5482, and clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824 were determined at various times during growth by a competitive binding radioimmunoassay procedure. the results were compared to those for escherichia coli nrrl b3704. the levels of camp ranged from undetectable for b. thetaiotaomicron to approximately 15 pmol/mg cell protein for p. ruminicola d31d. varying the growth substrate in a manner previously shown to elicit regulatory response did not alter the level of camp in these organisms. in general, camp concentrations present in these organisms were much lower than the 6-25 pmol/mg cell protein observed for e. coli. the levels of camp in p. ruminicola were consistently higher than levels in other anaerobes, particularly during the early exponential and stationary phases of growth. based on these data it seems unlikely that camp is involved in regulation of substrate catabolism in the anaerobic bacteria examined except in p. ruminicola where it may have an unknown  regulatory function.

TI  == influence of yucca shidigera extract on ruminal ammonia concentrations and ruminal microorganisms.
AB  == an extract of the desert plant yucca shidigera was assessed for its possible benefit in ruminal fermentation. the extract bound ammonia in aqueous solution when concentrations of ammonia were low (up to 0.4 mm) and when the extract was added at a high concentration to the sample (20%, vol/vol). the apparent ammonia-binding capability was retained after autoclaving and was decreased slightly following dialysis. acid-precipitated extract was inactive. no evidence  of substantial ammonia binding was found at higher ammonia concentrations (up to  30 mm). when y. shidigera extract (1%, vol/vol) was added to strained rumen fluid in vitro, a small (6%) but significant (p < 0.05) decrease in ammonia concentration occurred, apparently because of decreased proteolysis. inclusion of y. shidigera extract (1%, vol/vol) in the growth medium of the rumen bacterium streptococcus bovis es1 extended its lag phase, while growth of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens sh13 was abolished. the growth of prevotella (bacteroides) ruminicola b(1)4 was stimulated, and that of selenomonas ruminantium z108 was unaffected. protozoal activity, as measured by the breakdown of 14c-leucine-labelled s. ruminantium in rumen fluid incubated in vitro, was abolished by the addition of 1% extract. the antimicrobial activities were unaffected by precipitating tannins with polyvinylpyrrolidone, but a butanol extract, containing the saponin fraction, retained its antibacterial and antiprotozoal effects. saponins from other sources were less effective against protozoa than y. shidigera saponins. y. shidigera extract, therefore, appears unlikely to influence ammonia concentration in the rumen directly, but its saponins have antimicrobial properties, particularly in suppressing ciliate protozoa, which may prove beneficial to ruminal fermentation and may lead indirectly to lower ruminal ammonia concentrations.

TI  == effects of sainfoin (onobrychis viciifolia scop.) condensed tannins on growth and proteolysis by four strains of ruminal bacteria.
AB  == sainfoin leaf condensed tannins inhibited growth and protease activity in butyrivibrio fibrisolvens a38 and streptococcus bovis 45s1 but had little effect  on prevotella ruminicola b(1)4 or ruminobacter amylophilus wp225. tannins bound to cell coat polymers in all strains. morphological changes in b. fibrisolvens and s. bovis implicated the cell wall as a target of tannin toxicity.

TI  == pathogenicity of encapsulated bacteroides melaninogenicus group, b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the bacteroides melaninogenicus (bm) group and four clinical isolates of b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal abscesses. only 11 isolates of bm group and one b. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). when the other 23 isolates, however, were injected sc in combination with either klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. the bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. capsules also formed in bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of k. pneumoniae or encapsulated bacteroides sp. once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of peritonsillar abscess in children.
AB  == aspiration of peritonsillar abscess (quinsy) was aseptically performed in 16 children. patients' median age was 10 years (range 6 to 17 years), and 12 were males. unilateral abscess was present in all but one child. all aspirates were cultured for aerobes and anaerobes and yielded bacterial growth in all patients.  anaerobes were isolated in all patients; in 3 patients (19%), they were the only  organism isolated, and in 13 (81%), they were mixed with aerobes. there were 91 anaerobic isolates (5.7 per specimen): 42 bacteroides sp. (including 23 b. melaninogenicus, 5 b. oralis and 4 b. ruminicola ss. brevis); 18 anaerobic gram-positive cocci (including 10 peptostreptococcus sp., 4 peptococcus sp. and 4 microaerophilic streptococci); 15 fusobacterium sp.; and 3 clostridium sp. there  were 32 aerobic isolates (2.0 per specimen): 11 gamma-hemolytic streptococci, 8 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 4 group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, 4 haemophilus sp. and 3 s. aureus. beta-lactamase production was noted in 13 isolates recovered from 11 patients (68%). these were all isolates of s. aureus (3), 8 of 23 b. melaninogenicus (35%), and 2 of 5 b. oralis (40%). our findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of peritonsillar abscesses in children, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in two thirds of the patients.
