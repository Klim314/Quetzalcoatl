TI  == moxifloxacin resistance is prevalent among bacteroides and prevotella species in  greece.
AB  == objectives: moxifloxacin is recommended in the empirical treatment of infections  involving gram-negative anaerobes. however, current european data regarding its activity against anaerobic pathogens are limited. in order to evaluate its potency, we comparatively studied the activity of moxifloxacin against recently isolated gram-negative anaerobes. methods: four hundred and ninety-five gram-negative anaerobic clinical isolates (296 bacteroides fragilis group, 58 non-fragilis bacteroides spp. and 141 prevotella spp.) were prospectively recovered in six greek hospitals. moxifloxacin mics were determined in comparison with those of penicillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoxitin, imipenem, metronidazole and clindamycin. results: overall moxifloxacin mic(50) and mic(90)  were 2 and 32 mg/l, respectively. based on the current clsi breakpoints (susceptible, < or =2 mg/l; resistant, > or =8 mg/l), almost half of the total isolates (49%) were non-susceptible to moxifloxacin (32% resistant; 17% intermediate). this was more evident among the non-fragilis bacteroides species,  where 47% of the isolates were resistant and 14% intermediate to moxifloxacin. species variation was noticed, with the highest non-susceptible rates detected among prevotella oralis (90%), prevotella bivia (80%), bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (75%), bacteroides uniformis (70%) and bacteroides capillosus (67%) species. among the 19 (4%) isolates that were metronidazole non-susceptible (mic > or = 16 mg/l), only 4 (21%) were additionally non-susceptible to moxifloxacin. conclusions: high resistance rates to moxifloxacin among bacteroides and prevotella spp. were recorded, exceeding those previously reported in europe and contraindicating its use as monotherapy for infections involving gram-negative anaerobes without prior microbiological confirmation. for empirical usage, moxifloxacin should be combined with metronidazole in order to cover for these pathogens.

TI  == characterization of saccharolytic bacteroides and prevotella isolates from infected dog and cat bite wounds in humans.
AB  == saccharolytic, nonpigmented, anaerobic gram-negative rods isolated from infected  dog and cat bite wounds in humans have been poorly characterized, and most are not included in the databases of kits used for anaerobic identification; thus, they are problematic for clinical laboratories to identify. fifty strains isolated from such wounds were characterized with commercial kits for preformed-enzyme detection, carbohydrate fermentation, and other biochemical tests. pcr fingerprinting was performed on these strains to further characterize  subgroups within these species. bacteroides tectum is a frequent isolate in bite  wounds and resembles prevotella bivia in colony morphology and saccharolytic activity, except that it grows in 20% bile and hydrolyzes esculin. profile numbers generated by various kits associate b. tectum with p. bivia, prevotella oralis group, or prevotella melaninogenica. pcr fingerprinting identified at least four subgroups and confirmed the heterogeneous nature of this species. prevotella heparinolytica was also frequently isolated from these bite wounds. it produces indole and generates a profile number in preformed-enzyme kits that is usually associated with bacteroides uniformis. however, it is bile sensitive and  quite distinct from the bacteroides fragilis group of anaerobes. the pcr fingerprint profiles generated by strains of p. heparinolytica were very similar  to that of the type strain and to each other. prevotella zoogleoformans, occasionally isolated from dog and cat bite wounds in humans, resembles p. heparinolytica except for a negative indole test. clinical laboratories should be aware of the characteristics of these animal species when identifying isolates from animal bite wounds in humans.

TI  == prevotella, a new genus to include bacteroides melaninogenicus and related species formerly classified in the genus bacteroides.
AB  == it was recently proposed that the genus bacteroides should be restricted to bacteroides fragilis (the type species) and closely related organisms (viz., b. caccae, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. merdae, b. ovatus, b. stercoris, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, and b. vulgatus). by contrast, the moderately saccharolytic, predominantly oral bacteroides species, which include b. melaninogenicus, b. oralis, and related species, form a phenotypically and phylogenetically coherent group of species which differ so significantly from the emended description of the genus bacteroides that they should not be classified in the same genus. therefore, we formally propose that these species be reclassified in a new genus, prevotella. the type species is prevotella melaninogenica.
