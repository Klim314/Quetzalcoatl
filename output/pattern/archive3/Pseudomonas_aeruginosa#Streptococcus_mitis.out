[evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
introduction: antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (snp's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for therapeutic purposes. it is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal snp's possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of snp's against cariogenic bacteria: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis responsible for initiation of dental carries. tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. nanotechnology creates a new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. methods: colloidal silver solution (css) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis and s, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs of 7 patients treated for dental carries at department of conservative dentistry, medical university of warsaw. mic and mbc values for css's were evaluated. results: css used in this research is of good stability. no agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. mic values were: 12-25 ppm for s. salivarius, 25 ppm for s. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for s. mitis and 50 ppm for s. mutans, while mbc values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. after 24 hours of contact mbc values were: 25-50 ppm for s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for s. mitis and 200 ppmfor s. mutans. conclusions: antimicrobial properties of css depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. the susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.
[risk factors for ventilator-associated pneumonia in neonates and the changes of  isolated pathogens.]
objective: to study the risk factors for neonatal ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) and the changes of isolated pathogens in the last eight years. methods: the clinical data of 230 neonates who were admitted into the neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) and received mechanical ventilation for equal to or longer than 48 hrs in 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. the isolated pathogens were compared with those of eight years ago. results: the incidence of vap (25.2%) in the year 2008 was lower than that of eight years ago (36.1%; p<0.05). the development of vap was negatively correlated with the gestational age and the birth weight, but positively correlated with the duration of mechanical ventilation, intubation times, duration of hospitalization, presence of gastrointestinal bleeding and need for blood products transfusion. the main isolated pathogens were opportunistic antibiotics resistant bacteria, and the majority was gram negative bacilli (77%). the most frequently detected gram negative bacilli were klebsiella (20%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (18%) and acinetobacter (13%). streptococcus mitis was the most frequently detected gram positive bacilli (14%). the distribution pattern of pathogens isolated in the same nicu eight years ago was somewhat different: klebsiella (23%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (17%), acinetobacter (16%), streptococcus mitis (11%), fungi (1%) and candida albicans (1%). conclusions: the incidence of vap is correlated with gestational age, birth weight, duration of mechanical ventilation and hospitalization, intubation times, presence of gastrointestinal bleeding and need for blood products transfusion. the main isolated pathogens are usually antibiotic resistant opportunistic bacteria. the detection rate of stenotrophomonas maltophilia increased and that of pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased when compared with eight years ago.
