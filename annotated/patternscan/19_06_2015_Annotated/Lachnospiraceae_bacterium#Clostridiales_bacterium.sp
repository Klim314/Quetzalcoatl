TI  == gut microbiota: its role in hepatic encephalopathy.
AB  == ammonia, a key factor in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (he), is predominantly derived from urea breakdown by urease producing large intestinal bacteria and from small intestine and kidneys, where the enzyme glutaminases releases ammonia from circulating glutamine. non-culture techniques like pyrosequencing of bacterial 16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid are used to characterize fecal microbiota. fecal microbiota in patients with cirrhosis have been shown to alter with increasing child-turcotte-pugh (ctp) and model for end stage liver disease (meld) scores, and with development of covert or overt he. cirrhosis dysbiosis ratio (cdr), the ratio of autochthonous/good bacteria (e.g. lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae and clostridiales) to non-autochthonous/pathogenic bacteria (e.g. enterobacteriaceae and streptococcaceae), is significantly higher in controls and patients with compensated cirrhosis than patients with decompensated cirrhosis. although their  stool microbiota do not differ, sigmoid colonic mucosal microbiota in liver cirrhosis patients with and without he, are different. linkage of pathogenic colonic mucosal bacteria with poor cognition and inflammation suggests that important processes at the mucosal interface, such as bacterial translocation and immune dysfunction, are involved in the pathogenesis of he. fecal microbiome composition does not change significantly when he is treated with lactulose or when he recurs after lactulose withdrawal. despite improving cognition and endotoxemia as well as shifting positive correlation of pathogenic bacteria with  metabolites, linked to ammonia, aromatic amino acids and oxidative stress, to a negative correlation, rifaximin changes gut microbiome composition only modestly. these observations suggest that the beneficial effects of lactulose and rifaximin could be associated with a change in microbial metabolic function as well as an improvement in dysbiosis.

TI  == essential oils affect populations of some rumen bacteria in vitro as revealed by  microarray (rumenbactarray) analysis.
AB  == in a previous study origanum oil (oro), garlic oil (gao), and peppermint oil (peo) were shown to effectively lower methane production, decrease abundance of methanogens, and change abundances of several bacterial populations important to  feed digestion in vitro. in this study, the impact of these essential oils (eos,  at 0.50 g/l) on the rumen bacterial community composition and population was further examined using the recently developed rumenbactarray. species richness (expressed as number of operational taxonomic units, otus) in the phylum firmicutes, especially those in the class clostridia, was decreased by oro and gao, but increased by peo, while that in the phylum bacteroidetes was increased by oro and peo. species richness in the genus butyrivibrio was lowered by all the eos. increases of bacteroidetes otus mainly resulted from increases of prevotella otus. overall, 67 individual otus showed significant differences (p </= 0.05) in  relative abundance across the eo treatments. the predominant otus affected by eos were diverse, including those related to syntrophococcus sucromutans, succiniclasticum ruminis, and lachnobacterium bovis, and those classified to prevotella, clostridium, roseburia, pseudobutyrivibrio, lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae, prevotellaceae, bacteroidales, and clostridiales. in total, 60 otus were found significantly (p </= 0.05) correlated with feed degradability, ammonia concentration, and molar percentage of volatile fatty acids. taken together, this study demonstrated extensive impact of eos on rumen bacterial communities in an eo type-dependent manner, especially those in the predominant families prevotellaceae, lachnospiraceae, and ruminococcaceae. the information from this study may aid in understanding the effect of eos on feed digestion and  fermentation by rumen bacteria.

TI  == faecal microbiota of forage-fed horses in new zealand and the population dynamics of microbial communities following dietary change.
AB  == the effects of abrupt dietary transition on the faecal microbiota of forage-fed horses over a 3-week period were investigated. yearling thoroughbred fillies reared as a cohort were exclusively fed on either an ensiled conserved forage-grain diet ("group a"; n = 6) or pasture ("group b"; n = 6) for three weeks prior to the study. after the day 0 faecal samples were collected, horses of group a were abruptly transitioned to pasture. both groups continued to graze  similar pasture for three weeks, with faecal samples collected at 4-day intervals. dna was isolated from the faeces and microbial 16s and 18s rrna gene amplicons were generated and analysed by pyrosequencing. the faecal bacterial communities of both groups of horses were highly diverse (simpson's index of diversity > 0.8), with differences between the two groups on day 0 (p < 0.017 adjusted for multiple comparisons). there were differences between groups a and b in the relative abundances of four genera, bf311 (family bacteroidaceae; p = 0.003), cf231 (family paraprevotellaceae; p = 0.004), and currently unclassified  members within the order clostridiales (p = 0.003) and within the family lachnospiraceae (p = 0.006). the bacterial community of group a horses became similar to group b within four days of feeding on pasture, whereas the structure  of the archaeal community remained constant pre- and post-dietary change. the community structure of the faecal microbiota (bacteria, archaea and ciliate protozoa) of pasture-fed horses was also identified. the initial differences observed appeared to be linked to recent dietary history, with the bacterial community of the forage-fed horses responding rapidly to abrupt dietary change.

TI  == susceptibility to campylobacter infection is associated with the species composition of the human fecal microbiota.
AB  == the gut microbiota is essential for human health, but very little is known about  how the composition of this ecosystem can influence and respond to bacterial infections. here we address this by prospectively studying the gut microbiota composition before, during, and after natural campylobacter infection in exposed  poultry abattoir workers. the gut microbiota composition was analyzed with 16s amplicon sequencing of fecal samples from poultry abattoir workers during the peak season of campylobacter infection in sweden. the gut microbiota compositions were compared between individuals who became culture positive for campylobacter and those who remained negative. individuals who became campylobacter positive had a significantly higher abundance of bacteroides (p = 0.007) and escherichia (p = 0.002) species than those who remained culture negative. furthermore, this group had a significantly higher abundance of phascolarctobacterium (p = 0.017) and streptococcus (p = 0.034) sequences than the campylobacter-negative group, which had an overrepresentation of clostridiales (p = 0.017), unclassified lachnospiraceae (p = 0.008), and anaerovorax (p = 0.015) sequences. intraindividual comparisons of the fecal microbiota compositions yielded small differences over time in campylobacter-negative participants, but significant long-term changes were found in the campylobacter-positive group (p < 0.005). the results suggest that the abundance of specific genera in the microbiota reduces resistance to campylobacter colonization in humans and that campylobacter infection can have long-term effects on the composition of the human fecal microbiota. importance: studies using mouse models have made important contributions to our understanding of the role of the gut microbiota in resistance to bacterial enteropathogen colonization. the relative abundances of escherichia coli and bacteroides species have been pointed out as important determinants of susceptibility to gram-negative pathogens in general and campylobacter infection in particular. in this study, we assessed the role of the human gut microbiota in resistance to campylobacter colonization by studying abattoir workers that are heavily exposed to these bacteria. individuals with a certain composition of the gut microbiota became culture positive for campylobacter. as their microbiotas were characterized by high abundances of bacteroides spp. and e. coli, well in line with the findings with mouse models, these bacterial species likely play an important role in colonization resistance  also in humans.

TI  == randomised clinical trial: lactobacillus gg modulates gut microbiome, metabolome  and endotoxemia in patients with cirrhosis.
AB  == background: safety of individual probiotic strains approved under investigational new drug (ind) policies in cirrhosis with minimal hepatic encephalopathy (mhe) is not clear. aim: the primary aim of this phase i study was to evaluate the safety, tolerability of probiotic lactobacillus gg (lgg) compared to placebo, while secondary ones were to explore its mechanism of action using cognitive, microbiome, metabolome and endotoxin analysis in mhe patients. methods: cirrhotic patients with mhe patients were randomised 1:1 into lgg or placebo bid after being prescribed a standard diet and multi-vitamin regimen and were followed up for 8 weeks. serum, urine and stool samples were collected at baseline and study  end. safety was assessed at weeks 4 and 8. endotoxin and systemic inflammation, microbiome using multi-tagged pyrosequencing, serum/urine metabolome were analysed between groups using correlation networks. results: thirty mhe patients  (14 lgg and 16 placebo) completed the study without any differences in serious adverse events. however, self-limited diarrhoea was more frequent in lgg patients. a standard diet was maintained and lgg batches were comparable throughout. only in the lgg-randomised group, endotoxemia and tnf-alpha decreased, microbiome changed (reduced enterobacteriaceae and increased clostridiales incertae sedis xiv and lachnospiraceae relative abundance) with changes in metabolite/microbiome correlations pertaining to amino acid, vitamin and secondary ba metabolism. no change in cognition was found. conclusions: in this phase i study, lactobacillus gg is safe and well-tolerated in cirrhosis and  is associated with a reduction in endotoxemia and dysbiosis.

TI  == two necrotic enteritis predisposing factors, dietary fishmeal and eimeria infection, induce large changes in the caecal microbiota of broiler chickens.
AB  == it is widely established that a high-protein fishmeal supplemented starter diet and eimeria infection can predispose birds to the development of clinical necrotic enteritis symptoms following clostridium perfringens infection. however, it has not been clearly established what changes these treatments cause to predispose birds to succumb to necrotic enteritis. we analysed caecal microbiota  of 4 groups of broilers (n=12) using deep pyrosequencing of 16s rdna amplicons: (1) control chicks fed a control diet, (2) eimeria infected chicks fed control diet, (3) chicks fed fishmeal supplemented diet and lastly (4) both fishmeal fed  and eimeria infected chicks. we found that the high-protein fishmeal diet had a strong effect on the intestinal microbiota similar to the previously reported effect of c. perfringens infection. we noted major changes in the prevalence of various lactobacilli while the total culturable lactobacillus counts remained stable. the ruminococcaceae, lachnospiraceae, unknown clostridiales and lactobacillaceae families were most affected by fishmeal with increases in a number of operational taxonomic units (otus) that had previously been linked to crohn's disease and reductions in otus known to be butyrate producers. eimeria induced very different changes in microbiota; ruminococcaceae groups were reduced in number and three unknown clostridium species were increased in abundance. additionally, eimeria did not significantly influence changes in ph, formic, propionic or isobutyric acid while fishmeal induced dramatic changes in all these measures. both fishmeal feeding and eimeria infection induced significant changes in the gut microbiota; these changes may play an important role in predisposing birds to necrotic enteritis.

TI  == characterisation of the faecal bacterial community in adult and elderly horses fed a high fibre, high oil or high starch diet using 454 pyrosequencing.
AB  == faecal samples were collected from seventeen animals, each fed three different diets (high fibre, high fibre with a starch rich supplement and high fibre with an oil rich supplement). dna was extracted and the v1-v2 regions of 16srdna were  454-pyrosequenced to investigate the faecal microbiome of the horse. the effect of age was also considered by comparing mature (8 horses aged 5-12) versus elderly horses (9 horses aged 19-28). a reduction in diversity was found in the elderly horse group. significant differences between diets were found at an otu level (52 otus at corrected q<0.1). the majority of differences found were related to the firmucutes phylum (37) with some changes in bacteroidetes (6), proteobacteria (3), actinobacteria (2) and spirochaetes (1). for the forage only  diet,with no added starch or oil, we found 30/2934 otus (accounting for 15.9% of  sequences) present in all horses. however the core (i.e. present in all horses) associated with the oil rich supplemented diet was somewhat smaller (25/3029 otus, 10.3% ) and the core associated with the starch rich supplemented diet was  even smaller (15/2884 otus, 5.4% ). the core associated with samples across all three diets was extremely small (6/5689 otus accounting for only 2.3% of sequences) and dominated by the order clostridiales, with the most abundant family being lachnospiraceae. in conclusion, forage based diets plus starch or oil rich complementary feeds were associated with differences in the faecal bacterial community compared with the forage alone. further, as observed in people, ageing is associated with a reduction in bacterial diversity. however there was no change in the bacterial community structure in these healthy animals associated with age.

TI  == shedding light on the microbial community of the macropod foregut using 454-amplicon pyrosequencing.
AB  == twenty macropods from five locations in queensland, australia, grazing on a variety of native pastures were surveyed and the bacterial community of the foregut was examined using 454-amplicon pyrosequencing. specifically, the v3/v4 region of 16s rrna gene was examined. a total of 5040 otus were identified in the data set (post filtering). thirty-two otus were identified as 'shared' otus (i.e. present in all samples) belonging to either firmicutes or bacteroidetes (clostridiales/bacteroidales). these phyla predominated the general microbial community in all macropods. genera represented within the shared otus included: unclassified ruminococcaceae, unclassified lachnospiraceae, unclassified clostridiales, peptococcus sp. coprococcus spp., streptococcus spp., blautia sp., ruminoccocus sp., eubacterium sp., dorea sp., oscillospira sp. and butyrivibrio sp. the composition of the bacterial community of the foregut samples of each the host species (macropus rufus, macropus giganteus and macropus robustus) was significantly different allowing differentiation between the host species based on alpha and beta diversity measures. specifically, eleven dominant otus that separated the three host species were identified and classified as: unclassified  ruminococcaceae, unclassified bacteroidales, prevotella spp. and a syntrophococcus sucromutans. putative reductive acetogens and fibrolytic bacteria were also identified in samples. future work will investigate the presence and role of fibrolytics and acetogens in these ecosystems. ideally, the isolation and characterization of these organisms will be used for enhanced feed efficiency in  cattle, methane mitigation and potentially for other industries such as the biofuel industry.

TI  == sewage reflects the distribution of human faecal lachnospiraceae.
AB  == faecal pollution contains a rich and diverse community of bacteria derived from animals and humans, many of which might serve as alternatives to the traditional  enterococci and escherichia coli faecal indicators. we used massively parallel sequencing (mps) of the 16s rrna gene to characterize microbial communities from  wastewater treatment plant (wwtp) influent sewage from 12 cities geographically distributed across the usa. we examined members of the clostridiales, which included the families clostridiaceae, lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae for their potential as sewage indicators. lachnospiraceae was one of the most abundant groups of faecal bacteria in sewage, and several lachnospiraceae high-abundance sewage pyrotags occurred in at least 46 of 48 human faecal samples. clone libraries targeting clostridium coccoides (c. coccoides) in sewage samples demonstrated that lachnospiraceae-annotated v6 pyrotags encompassed the previously reported c. coccoides group. we used oligotyping to profile the genus  blautia within lachnospiraceae and found oligotypes comprised of 24 entropy components that showed patterns of host specificity. these findings suggest that  indicators based on blautia might have the capacity to discriminate between different faecal pollution sources. development of source-specific alternative indicators would enhance water quality assessments, which leads to improved ecosystem health and reduced human health risk due to waterborne disease.

TI  == high-throughput dna sequence analysis reveals stable engraftment of gut microbiota following transplantation of previously frozen fecal bacteria.
AB  == fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) is becoming a more widely used technology  for treatment of recurrent clostridum difficile infection (cdi). while previous treatments used fresh fecal slurries as a source of microbiota for fmt, we recently reported the successful use of standardized, partially purified and frozen fecal microbiota to treat cdi. here we report that high-throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing showed stable engraftment of gut microbiota following fmt using frozen fecal bacteria from a healthy donor. similar bacterial taxa were found in post-transplantation samples obtained from the recipients and donor samples, but the relative abundance varied considerably between patients and time points. post fmt samples from patients showed an increase in the abundance of firmicutes and bacteroidetes, representing 75-80% of the total sequence reads. proteobacteria and actinobacteria were less abundant (< 5%) than that found in patients prior to fmt. post fmt samples from two patients were very similar to donor samples, with the bacteroidetes phylum represented by a great abundance of  members of the families bacteroidaceae, rikenellaceae and porphyromonadaceae, and were largely comprised of bacteroides, alistipes and parabacteroides genera. members of the phylum firmicutes were represented by ruminococcaceae, lachnospiraceae, verrucomicrobiaceae and unclassified clostridiales and members of the firmicutes. one patient subsequently received antibiotics for an unrelated infection, resulting in an increase in the number of intestinal proteobacteria, primarily enterobacteriaceae. our results demonstrate that frozen fecal microbiota from a healthy donor can be used to effectively treat recurrent cdi resulting in restoration of the structure of gut microbiota and clearing of clostridum difficile.

TI  == effect of high contents of dietary animal-derived protein or carbohydrates on canine faecal microbiota.
AB  == background: considerable evidence suggests that food impacts both the gastro-intestinal (gi) function and the microbial ecology of the canine gi tract. the aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of high-carbohydrate (hc), high-protein (hp) and dry commercial (dc) diets on the canine colonic microbiota  in beagle dogs. diets were allocated according to the graeco-latin square design. for this purpose, microbial dna was isolated from faecal samples and separated by density gradient centrifugation, resulting in specific profiling based on the guanine-cytosine content (%g+c). in addition, 16 s rrna gene amplicons were obtained from the most abundant %g + c peaks and analysed by sequence analysis, producing a total of 720 non-redundant sequences (240 sequences per diet). results: the dc diet sample showed high abundance of representatives of the orders clostridiales, lactobacillales, coriobacteriales and bacteroidales. sequence diversity was highest for dc diet samples and included representatives of the orders lactobacillales and bacteroidales, which were not detected in samples from the hp and hc diets. these latter two diets also had reduced levels  of representatives of the family lachnospiraceae, specifically clostridial cluster xiva. the hc diet favoured representatives of the order erysipelotrichales, more specifically the clostridial cluster xviii, while the hp diet favoured representatives of the order fusobacteriales. conclusions: this study detected coriobacteriales in dog faeces, possibly due to the non-selective  nature of the %g + c profiling method used in combination with sequencing. moreover, our work demonstrates that the effect of diet on faecal microbiota can  be explained based on the metabolic properties of the detected microbial taxa.

TI  == anaerobic utilization of pectinous substrates at extremely haloalkaline conditions by natranaerovirga pectinivora gen. nov., sp. nov., and natranaerovirga hydrolytica sp. nov., isolated from hypersaline soda lakes.
AB  == anaerobic enrichments at ph 10, with pectin and polygalacturonates as substrates  and inoculated with samples of sediments of hypersaline soda lakes from the kulunda steppe (altai, russia) demonstrated the potential for microbial pectin degradation up to soda-saturating conditions. the enrichments resulted in the isolation of six strains of obligately anaerobic fermentative bacteria, which represented a novel deep lineage within the order clostridiales loosely associated with the family lachnospiraceae. the isolates were rod-shaped and formed terminal round endospores. one of the striking features of the novel group is a very narrow substrate spectrum for growth, restricted to galacturonic acid and its polymers (e.g. pectin). acetate and formate were the final fermentation products. growth was possible in a ph range from 8 to 10.5, with an optimum at ph 9.5-10, and in a salinity range from 0.2 to 3.5 m na(+). on the basis of unique phenotypic properties and distinct phylogeny, the pectinolytic isolates are proposed to be assigned to a new genus natranaerovirga with two species n. hydrolytica (app2(t)=dsm24176(t)=uniqem u806(t)) and n. pectinivora (ap3(t)=dsm24629(t)=uniqem u805(t)).

AB  == two novel obligately anaerobic, gram-stain-positive, saccharolytic and non-proteolytic spore-forming bacilli (strains cd3:22(t) and n1(t)) are described. strain cd3:22(t) was isolated from a biopsy of the small intestine of  a child with coeliac disease, and strain n1(t) from the saliva of a healthy young man. the cells of both strains were observed to be filamentous, approximately 5 to >20 microm long, some of them curving and with swellings. the novel organisms  produced h(2)s, nh(3), butyric acid and acetic acid as major metabolic end products. phylogenetic analyses, based on comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing, revealed close relationships (98% sequence similarity) between the two isolates,  as well as the type strain of eubacterium saburreum and four other lachnospiraceae bacterium-/e. saburreum-like organisms. this group of bacteria were clearly different from any of the 19 known genera in the family lachnospiraceae. while eubacterium species are reported to be non-spore-forming,  reanalysis of e. saburreum ccug 28089(t) confirmed that the bacterium is indeed able to form spores. based on 16s rrna gene sequencing, phenotypic and biochemical properties, strains cd3:22(t) and n1(t) represent novel species of a  new and distinct genus, named lachnoanaerobaculum gen. nov., in the family lachnospiraceae [within the order clostridiales, class clostridia, phylum firmicutes]. strain cd3:22(t) (=ccug 58757(t) =dsm 23576(t)) is the type strain of the type species, lachnoanaerobaculum umeaense gen. nov., sp. nov., of the proposed new genus. strain n1(t) (=ccug 60305(t)=dsm 24553(t)) is the type strain of lachnoanaerobaculum orale sp. nov. moreover, eubacterium saburreum is reclassified as lachnoanaerobaculum saburreum comb. nov.

TI  == identification and characterization of potential performance-related gut microbiotas in broiler chickens across various feeding trials.
AB  == three broiler feeding trials were investigated in order to identify gut bacteria  consistently linked with improvements in bird performance as measured by feed efficiency. trials were done in various geographic locations and varied in diet composition, broiler breed, and bird age. gut microbial communities were investigated using microbial profiling. eight common performance-linked operational taxonomic units (otus) were identified within both the ilea (180, 492, and 564-566) and ceca (140-142, 218-220, 284-286, 312, and 482) across trials. otu 564-566 was associated with lower performance, while otus 140-142, 482, and 492 were associated with improved performance. targeted cloning and sequencing of these eight otus revealed that they represented 26 bacterial species or phylotypes which clustered phylogenetically into seven groups related  to lactobacillus spp., ruminococcaceae, clostridiales, gammaproteobacteria, bacteroidales, clostridiales/lachnospiraceae, and unclassified bacteria/clostridia. where bacteria were identifiable to the phylum level, they belonged predominantly to the firmicutes, with bacteroidetes and proteobacteria also identified. some of the potential performance-related phylotypes showed high sequence identity with classified bacteria (lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus aviarius, lactobacillus crispatus, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, escherichia coli, gallibacterium anatis, clostridium lactatifermentans, ruminococcus torques, bacteroides vulgatus, and alistipes finegoldii). the 16s rrna gene sequence information generated will allow quantitative assays to be developed which will enable elucidations of which of these phylotypes are truly performance related. this information could be used to monitor strategies to improve feed efficiency and feed formulation for optimal gut health.

TI  == influence of antimicrobial feed additives on broiler commensal posthatch gut microbiota development and performance.
AB  == the effects of avilamycin, zinc bacitracin, and flavophospholipol on broiler gut  microbial community colonization and bird performance in the first 17 days posthatch were investigated. significant differences in gut microbiota associated with gut section, dietary treatment, and age were identified by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp), although no performance-related differences between dietary treatments were detected. similar age-related shifts in the gut microbiota were identified regardless of diet but varied between the ilea and ceca. interbird variabilities in ileal bacterial communities were reduced (3 to 7 days posthatch) in chicks fed with feed containing antimicrobial agents. avilamycin and flavophospholipol had the most consistent effect on gut microbial communities. operational taxonomic units (otu) linked to changes in gut microbiota in birds on antimicrobial-supplemented diets  were characterized and identified. some otus could be identified to the species level; however, the majority could be only tentatively classified to the genus, family, order, or domain level. otus 140 to 146 (lachnospiraceae), otu 186/188 (lactobacillus johnsonii), otu 220 (lachnospiraceae), otus 284 to 288 (unclassified bacterial spp. or ruminococcaceae), otu 296/298 (unclassified bacterium or clostridiales), and otu 480/482 (oxalobacteraceae) were less prevalent in the guts of chicks fed antimicrobial-supplemented diets. otu 178/180 (lactobacillus crispatus), otu 152 (lactobacillus reuteri or unclassified clostridiales), otu 198/200 (subdoligranulum spp.), and otu 490/492 (unclassified bacterium or enterobacteriaceae) were less prevalent in the gut of chicks raised  on the antimicrobial-free diet. the identification of key bacterial species influenced by antimicrobial-supplemented feed immediately posthatch may assist in the formulation of diets that facilitate beneficial gut microbial colonization and, hence, the development of alternatives to current antimicrobial agents in feed for sustainable poultry production.

AB  == microbial biohydrogenation of dietary poly-unsaturated fatty acids (pufa) to saturated fatty acids (sfa) in the rumen results in the high ratio of sfa/pufa in ruminant products, such as meat and milk. in vitro, butyrivibrio proteoclasticus-related bacteria extensively biohydrogenate pufa to sfa, yet their contribution in the rumen has not been confirmed. the aim of this study was to evaluate the role of butyrivibrio proteoclasticus group bacteria in ruminal biohydrogenation and to assess the possible role of other bacteria. fish oil at 0%, 1.5% and 3% dry matter intake was fed to eight holstein x friesian steers, in order to elicit changes in the extent of pufa biohydrogenation. fatty acid and b. proteoclasticus group 16s rrna concentrations in rumen digesta were determined. correlation between digesta 18:0 concentration and b. proteoclasticus group 16s rrna concentration was low. terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) coupled with multivariate statistics revealed that many terminal restriction fragments (t-rfs) and dgge bands were linked to cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (cla), 18:1 trans-11 and 18:0 ruminal concentrations. mica t-rf predictive identification software showed that these linked t-rfs were likely to originate from as yet uncultured bacteria classified as prevotella, lachnospiraceae incertae sedis, and unclassified bacteroidales, clostridiales and ruminococcaceae. sequencing of linked dgge bands also revealed that as yet uncultured bacteria classified as prevotella, anaerovoax (member of the lachnospiraceae incertae sedis family), and unclassified clostridiales and ruminococcaceae may play a role in biohydrogenation.

AB  == the aim of this study was to describe the microbial communities in the distal gut of wild wolves (canis lupus). fecal samples were collected from three healthy unrelated adult wolves captured at the nearby of dalai lake nature reserve in inner mongolia of china. the diversity of fecal bacteria was investigated by constructing pcr-amplified 16s rrna gene clone libraries using the universal bacterial primers 27 f and 1493 r. a total of 307 non-chimeric near-full-length 16s rrna gene sequences were analyzed and 65 non-redundant bacteria phylotypes (operational taxonomical units, otus) were identified. seventeen otus (26%) showed less than 98% sequence similarity to 16s rrna gene sequences were reported previously. five different bacterial phyla were identified, with the majority of  otus being classified within the phylum firmicutes (60%), followed by bacteroidetes (16.9%), proteobacteria (9.2%), fusobacteria (9.2%) and actinobacteria (4.6%). the majority of clones fell within the order clostridiales (53.8% of otus). it was predominantly affiliated with five families: lachnospiraceae was the most diverse bacterial family in this order, followed by  ruminococcaceae, clostridiaceae, peptococcaceae and peptostreptococcaceae.

TI  == effect of dietary protein level on growth performance, indicators of enteric health, and gastrointestinal microbial ecology of weaned pigs induced with postweaning colibacillosis.
AB  == the effect of dietary cp level on performance, enteric health, and gastrointestinal microbial ecology of weaned pigs challenged with enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) k88 was investigated in a 14-d study. forty weaned pigs (bw = 5.32 +/- 0.24 kg, mean +/- sd), housed 4 per pen, were randomly assigned to 2 diets (5 pens/diet): 1) 22.5% cp or 2) 17.6% cp supplemented with aa. diets contained the same amount of me and standardized ileal digestible lys, met + cys, thr, and trp based on the ideal protein ratio. isoleucine and val were added to the 17.6% cp diet up to the level in the 22.5% cp diet. on d 8 postweaning, pigs  were challenged with 6 ml of etec suspension (10(10) cfu/ml) by gavage. feed disappearance and bw were measured on d 7, 9, 10, 12, and 14 for determination of adg, adfi, and g:f. one pig from each pen was serially slaughtered on -1, 3, and  7 d postchallenge (10 pigs/d of slaughter) to evaluate gut morphology, and gut microbial ecology and metabolites. pigs fed the 22.5% cp diet had greater (p < 0.05) adg and g:f than those fed the 17.6% cp diet before infection, but performance was similar between the 2 diets after etec challenge and overall. on  d 3 after challenge, etec was not detected in the ileal digesta of pigs fed the 17.6% cp diet but was detected in the ileal digesta of 80% of pigs fed the 22.5%  cp diet (5.22 +/- 1.07 cfu/g, mean +/- sd). pigs fed the 17.6% cp diet had a greater (p < 0.01) prevalence of order clostridiales (73 vs. 50%), family lachnospiraceae (43 vs. 18%), and genus roseburia (13 vs. 3%) in the colon digesta 7 d after challenge compared with those fed the 22.5% cp diet. the richness and diversity of bacteria in the colon digesta were less (p < 0.05) in pigs fed the 17.6% cp diet than in those fed the 22.5% cp diet at -1, 3, and 7 d  postchallenge. pigs fed the 22.5% cp diet had greater (p < 0.05) ammonia n concentration in the colon digesta on -1 and 7 d after challenge compared with those fed the 17.6% cp diet. pigs fed the 22.5% cp diet had deeper (p < 0.05) crypts 1 d before challenge, shorter villi 3 d after challenge, and reduced villus height:crypt depth 1 d before and 3 d after challenge compared with those  fed the 17.6% cp diet. in conclusion, a reduction in the dietary cp level of weaned pigs from 22.5 to 17.6% with aa supplementation impaired growth performance before, but not after, the etec challenge and increased the relative  composition of butyrate producing bacteria in the colon digesta after etec challenge.

TI  == eubacterium rangiferina, a novel usnic acid-resistant bacterium from the reindeer rumen.
AB  == reindeer are able to eat and utilize lichens as an important source of energy and nutrients. in the current study, the activities of antibiotic secondary metabolites including usnic, antranoric, fumarprotocetraric, and lobaric acid commonly found in lichens were tested against a collection of 26 anaerobic rumen  bacterial isolates from reindeer (rangifer tarandus tarandus) using the agar diffusion method. the isolates were identified based on their 16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rrna) gene sequences. usnic acid had a potent antimicrobial effect against 25 of the isolates, belonging to clostridiales, enterococci, and streptococci. isolates of clostridia and streptococci were also susceptible to atranoric and lobaric acid. however, one isolate (r3_91_1) was found to be resistant to usnic, antranoric, fumarprotocetraric, and lobaric acid. r3_91_1 was also seen invading and adhering to lichen particles when grown in a liquid anaerobic culture as demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy. this was a gram-negative, nonmotile rod (0.2-0.7 x 2.0-3.5 microm) with a deoxyribonucleic acid g + c content of 47.0 mol% and main cellular fatty acids including 15:0 anteiso-dimethyl acetal (dma), 16:0 iso-fatty acid methyl ester (fame), 13:0 iso-3oh fame, and 17:0 anteiso-fame, not matching any of the presently known profiles in the midi database. combined, the phenotypic and genotypic traits including the 16s rrna gene sequence show that r3_91_1 is a novel species inside  the order clostridiales within the family lachnospiraceae, for which we propose the name eubacterium rangiferina. this is the first record of a rumen bacterium able to tolerate and grow in the presence of usnic acid, indicating that the rumen microorganisms in these animals have adapted mechanisms to deal with lichen secondary metabolites, well known for their antimicrobial and toxic effects.

TI  == intestinal microbiota: a potential diet-responsive prevention target in apcmin mice.
AB  == we previously reported that two dietary regimens, calorie restriction (cr) and a  high olive oil-containing diet supplemented with a freeze-dried fruit and vegetable extract (ofv), reduced the development of intestinal adenomas in apc(min) mice by 57% and 33%, respectively, compared to control mice fed a defined diet ad libitum. the ofv diet was designed to have a strong effect on the composition of the intestinal microbiota through its high content of fiber, which represents a major source of fermentable substrate for the gut bacteria. we hypothesized that some of the observed effects of diet on intestinal carcinogenesis might be mediated by diet-related changes in the bacterial species that thrive in the gut. therefore, we determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) how the dietary interventions affected the composition of the intestinal microbiota, and  we characterized specific microbiota changes that were associated with diet and reduced intestinal carcinogenesis. the ofv diet changed the overall composition of the intestinal microbiota, smaller changes were observed for the cr diet. furthermore, we detected a 16s rdna fragment associated with mice that did not develop polyps. sequence analysis suggested that hitherto unidentified bacteria belonging to the family lachnospiraceae (order clostridiales) were its source. thus, these bacteria may be an indicator of intestinal conditions associated with reduced intestinal carcinogenesis in apc(min) mice.

TI  == fermentation of glycolate by a pure culture of a strictly anaerobic gram-positive bacterium belonging to the family lachnospiraceae.
AB  == the component bacteria of a three-membered mixed culture able to ferment glycolate to acetate, propionate and co(2) were isolated in pure culture. all three strains were strict anaerobes that, on the basis of comparative 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, belonged to the order clostridiales in the phylum firmicutes (low g+c gram-positive bacteria). two of the strains were not involved in glycolate metabolism. the third, the glycolate-fermenting strain 19gly4 (dsm 11261), was related to members of the family lachnospiraceae. the cells of strain 19gly4 were oval- to lemon-shaped, 0.85 microm long and 0.65 microm in diameter,  occurring singly, in pairs, or in chains of up to 30 cells. strain 19gly4 fermented glycolate or fumarate to acetate, succinate, and co(2). hydrogen was not formed, and strain 19gly4 was able to grow on glycolate in pure culture without any syntrophic hydrogen transfer and without the use of an external electron acceptor. there was no evidence for homoacetogenic metabolism. this bacterium therefore differs in metabolism from previously reported glycolate-utilising anaerobes.
