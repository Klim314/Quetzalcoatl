TI  == microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  == aim: the present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. methods: we identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp). results: nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. a single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per ml of bile (> 105 cfu/ml). the predominant gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). the predominant gram-positive bacteria were enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. all gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (cim90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/ml. gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. although all five isolates of e. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) e. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. conclusion: e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. faecalis and streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.

TI  == cefditoren, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin.
AB  == cefditoren pivoxil, an oral third-generation cephalosporin, was approved by the food and drug administration in september 2001. it has been used in japan for several years. the greatest therapeutic potential of cefditoren appears to be its activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms causing respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections, such as haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and moraxella catarrhalis. cefditoren is also effective against methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus.  nevertheless, cefditoren has no activity against atypical pathogens, including chlamydia pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and legionella sp. moreover, cefditoren does not inhibit pseudomonas aeruginosa or bacteroides fragilis. in virtually all studies, cefditoren has compared favorably against other orally administered antibiotics used against the most commonly isolated respiratory tract pathogens. its side effect profile includes diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, and dyspepsia. cefditoren is indicated for treatment of mild-to-moderate acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, pharyngitis-tonsillitis, and uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by susceptible strains of organisms in adults and adolescents (> or = 12 yrs of age). based on its reported antimicrobial activity, cefditoren has potential for empiric management of most commonly encountered respiratory tract infections. additional studies will further define its role in clinical practice.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activities of t-3811me, a novel des-f(6)-quinolone.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo activities of t-3811me, a novel des-f(6)-quinolone, were evaluated in comparison with those of some fluoroquinolones, including a newly developed one, trovafloxacin. t-3811, a free base of t-3811me, showed a wide range of antimicrobial spectra, including activities against chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and mycobacterium tuberculosis. in particular, t-3811 exhibited potent activity against various gram-positive cocci, with mics at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (mic90s) of 0.025 to 6.25 microgram/ml. t-3811 was the most active agent against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and streptococci, including penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp). t-3811 also showed potent activity against quinolone-resistant gram-positive cocci with gyra and parc (grla) mutations. the  activity of t-3811 against members of the family enterobacteriaceae and nonfermentative gram-negative rods was comparable to that of trovafloxacin. in common with other fluoroquinolones, t-3811 was highly active against haemophilus  influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and legionella sp., with mic90s of 0.0125 to 0.1 microgram/ml. t-3811 showed a potent activity against anaerobic bacteria, such as bacteroides fragilis and clostridium difficile. t-3811 was the most active agent against c. trachomatis (mic, 0.008 microgram/ml) and m. pneumoniae (mic90, 0.0313 microgram/ml). the activity of t-3811 against m. tuberculosis (mic90, 0.0625 microgram/ml) was potent and superior to that of trovafloxacin. in experimental systemic infection with a grla mutant of s. aureus and experimental  pneumonia with prsp in mice, t-3811me showed excellent therapeutic efficacy in oral and subcutaneous administrations.

TI  == sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

TI  == [an evaluation of pathogens in patients with bronchopulmonary infection by transtracheal aspiration: december 1978-march 1993].
AB  == we performed transtracheal aspiration (tta) in 1165 patients, who were suspected  to have bronchopulmonary infection, from december 1978 to march 1993. we isolated pathogens from tta in 806 patients (69.2%). we isolated h. influenzae (62 cases), s. pneumoniae (39 cases) and m. catarrhalis (24 cases) in patients with acute bronchitis, s. pneumoniae (65 cases), alpha-streptococcus sp. (52 cases), h. influenzae (32 cases) and s. aureus (29 cases) in patients with pneumonia or lung abscess and h. influenzae (174 cases), s. pneumoniae (84 cases), p. aeruginosa (81 cases) and m. catarrhalis (42 cases) in patients with chronic lower respiratory tract infection. anaerobic bacteria isolated from tta included peptostreptococcus sp. (19 cases), bacteroides sp. (19 cases) and others. mycoplasma pneumoniae was isolated from tta in 8 patients with pneumonia without  other organisms. virus isolated from tta included rhinovirus (6 cases) and others. these results suggest that various pathogens affect the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary infection. therefore, we must diagnose the bronchopulmonary infection by the correct methods such as tta.

TI  == otitis media: microbiology and management.
AB  == otitis media (om) is a common childhood disease and one that can cause significant morbidity. a knowledge of the pathogens responsible for om can assist in the selection of the most appropriate treatment regimen and can minimize complications that may require surgery. the microbiology of acute, serous, and chronic om is reviewed. the major organisms recovered from about three quarters of acute om and half of serous om cultures are haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and moraxella catarrhalis. streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, and viruses can each be isolated in less than 5% of the patients with acute om. the predominant organisms isolated from chronic om are staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anaerobic bacteria. the predominant anaerobes are gram-positive cocci, pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas sp, bacteroides sp, and fusobacterium sp. many of the aerobic and anaerobic organisms causing om can produce beta-lactamase, rendering them resistant to many of the penicillins. the appropriate surgical and medical therapies for acute, serous, and chronic otitis media are discussed.

TI  == the effect of antimicrobial therapy on mixed infections with bacteroides species. is eradication of the anaerobes important?
AB  == antimicrobial agents were used alone or in combinations in order to explore their effect on mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections. subcutaneous abscesses were induced in mice by single and mixed infections of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the infected animals were treated for 5 days with spiramycin, gentamicin or metronidazole alone, or metronidazole combined with spiramycin or gentamicin. animals were killed 5 days after inoculation and the bacterial contents of the abscesses determined. infection induced by a single species of bacteria always responded to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. in infections caused by two species of organisms, however, therapy directed at either the bacteroides sp. (with metronidazole) or the aerobes or facultative anaerobes (with spiramycin or  gentamicin) was effective not only in significantly reducing the numbers of the target organism but also, in 13 of 24 instances, in reducing to a small extent the numbers of the other bacteria. despite this phenomenon, in no instance did therapy with a single agent eliminate the infection and eradicate the untargeted  organism. the combination of spiramycin and metronidazole increased the reduction in numbers of b. melaninogenicus in single-organism infections and of bacteroides sp. in mixed infections with s. aureus and s. pyogenes. these findings support the need to aim treatment at all components of mixed infections.

TI  == microbiology of empyema in children and adolescents.
AB  == the microbiology of empyema was studied in 72 children and adolescents whose specimens yielded bacterial growth after inoculation for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. a total of 93 organisms, 60 aerobic or facultative and 33 anaerobic, were isolated. aerobic bacteria was isolated in 48 (67%) patients, anaerobic bacteria in 17 (24%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 7 (10%). the predominant aerobic or facultative bacteria were haemophilus influenzae (15 isolates), streptococcus pneumoniae (13), and staphylococcus aureus (10). the predominant anaerobes were bacteroides sp (15 isolates, including 7 bacteroides fragilis group and 5 bacteroides melaninogenicus group), anaerobic cocci (9), and fusobacterium sp (6). beta-lactamase activity was detected in at least one isolate in 20 (37%) of the 54 tested patients. these included all 8 tested s aureus and 7 b fragilis group, 3 of 10 h influenzae, 2 of 4 b melaninogenicus group, and 1 of 2 klebsiella pneumoniae. most cases of s pneumoniae and h influenzae were associated with pneumonia. the recovery of anaerobic bacteria was mostly associated with the concomitant diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia, lung abscess, subdiaphragmatic abscess, and abscesses of dental or oropharyngeal origin. the data highlight the importance of anaerobic bacteria in selected cases of empyema in children and adolescents.

TI  == in-vitro studies with ramoplanin (mdl 62,198): a novel lipoglycopeptide antimicrobial.
AB  == ramoplanin is a novel lipoglycopeptide antimicrobial complex, isolated from the fermentation products of a strain of actinoplanes sp. (atcc 33076), which comprises three closely related polypeptides, each containing chlorinated phenyl  moieties and d-mannose. the in-vitro activity of ramoplanin was compared with those of vancomycin and teicoplanin. ramoplanin was very active against staphylococcus spp., irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, with all isolates inhibited by 1 mg/l or less. concentrations of vancomycin and teicoplanin required to inhibit the same population of bacteria were 4 and 16 mg/l, respectively. ramoplanin was also very active against streptococcus spp. (alpha- and beta-haemolytic species, str. pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis, corynebacterium spp. (including cory. jeikeium), listeria monocytogenes, gardnerella vaginalis, propionibacterium acnes and gram-positive anaerobic bacteria, with all isolates inhibited by 2 mg/l, or less. in general, the activity of ramoplanin against these species was either equal to or only slightly less than teicoplanin and equal to or somewhat greater than vancomycin. with the  exception of bacteroides melaninogenicus and bact. bivius, ramoplanin was not active against gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == [in vitro susceptibility to a new antimicrobial agent (imipenem) of pathogens isolated from inpatients at various centers].
AB  == imipenem is a beta lactam antibiotic, a highly potent new carbapenem with broad antibacterial spectrum. to test the "in vitro" efficacy of this antimicrobial agent in pathogens more frequent in several medical centers in brazil, susceptibility testing with 10 mcg imipenem disks and, or corresponding mic were  carried out with 1231 recent isolates of 41 different bacterial species, obtained mainly from hospitalized patients in 5 different medical centers of the cities of s. paulo, rio de janeiro and salvador. our preliminary results with this antibiotic, in final phases of clinical and laboratorial experimentation in this  country, are very promissing with, 96.79% of susceptibility of test isolates to 10 mcg imipenem disks and corresponding mic correlation of up to 4 micrograms/ml. (92.31%). of the 9 bacterial species more frequently isolated totaling 1108 (82%) of the 1230 test isolates, disk susceptibility was 99% (e. coli), 93% (pseudomonas aeruginosas), 87% (staphylococcus aureus), 100% (klebsiella pneumoniae), 98% (klebsiella sp), 97% (proteus mirabiles), 94% (enterobacter sp), 100% (streptococcus faecalis) with good mic correlation (up to 8 mcg/ml) and 100% for the anaerobic species bacteroides sp (mic up to 4 micrograms/ml). "in vitro"  efficacy to hospital pathogens with high frequency of resistance to most antibiotics as pseudomonas aeruginosa and to anaerobes notably bacteroides sp is  emphasized.

TI  == in vitro activity of two new aryl-fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents, difloxacin (a-56619) and a-56620 compared to that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the in vitro activity of difloxacin (a-56619) and a-56620, two new aryl-difluoroquinolones, was compared to that of other new quinolones and several parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents. a-56620 inhibited 90% of enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, staphylococcus aureus 0.25 micrograms/ml, hemolytic streptococci 2 micrograms/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 micrograms/ml, bacteroides sp. and clostridium at 8 micrograms/ml. a-56620 was equal or 2-fold more active than norfloxacin and ofloxacin, and 2-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin. difloxacin had similar in vitro activity with many isolates but usually was 2-8-fold less active than a-56620. both agents inhibited beta-lactamase positive haemophilus influenzae (mic 0.015 micrograms/ml) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mk less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml). both agents were more active against streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae than norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin, but not more active than ciprofloxacin. they inhibited enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens resistant to cephalosporins and methicillin-resistant s. aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. spontaneously resistant mutants were seen with enterobacteriaceae, p. aeruginosa and s. aureus  at a frequency similar to that found for other new quinolones. these agents show  overall in vitro activity comparable to other quinolones in clinical trial or recently approved for clinical use.

AB  == 6 typical bacteria species of the human intestinal flora (e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, streptococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, bifidobacterium sp.) were incubated in a liquid medium for 48 h with [15n2]-urea  and [15n]-ammonium chloride. the rates of [15n]-incorporation were calculated. they depend reproducible on the species examined, on the kind of the offered npn-substance and on the amount of npn-substance in the medium. with [15n2]-urea  the minimal rate of incorporation was 3.8% (e coli) and the maximal one 95.6% (bifidobacterium sp.). with [15n]-ammonium chloride the corresponding figures were 31.0 (proteus vulg.) and 98.0% (bifidobacterium sp.). the findings are discussed with regard to a possible enteral detoxification in uremic patients by  bacterial utilization and elimination of urea and ammonia.

TI  == [bacterial infection agents in hospitalized patients].
AB  == during six months the pattern of microbial isolates has been analysed from 1492 urinary tract infections, from 1445 wound infections, from 451 bronchial secretions, from 3067 blood cultures, from 116 peritoneal swabs and from 39 cerebrospinal fluids. all the specimens investigated were taken from patients of  surgical, neurosurgical, internal wards and two intensive care units. in total, the most frequent isolates were grampositive microorganisms like staphylococus aureus, straphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus sp. of different serotypes. out of the enterobacteriaceae escherichia coli and klebisella pneumoniae predominated followed by enterobacter cloacae and indolnegative and -positive proteus species. the over all isolation rate of pseudomonas aeruginosa in nosocomial infections was about 10%. in the last time pseudomonas maltophilia will be isolated more frequently as well as occasional streptococcus faecium and  corynebacterium jk. dependent from the site of infection anaerobic bacteria like  bacteroides sp., peptococcus- and peptostreptococcus sp. are really important in  the infectious diseases. the epidemiological data should be always transmitted to the infection control board. from there preventive measures must be induced.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of ci-934 compared with that of other new 4-quinolones and  nalidixic acid.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of ci-934, a new 4-quinolone compound, was compared with that of the other new 4-quinolones, enoxacin and ciprofloxacin, and also with that of nalidixic acid. ci-934 was more active than any of the other 4-quinolones tested against gram-positive aerobic organisms including staphylococcus aureus (mics 0.06-0.25 mg/l), beta-haemolytic streptococci (mics 0.12-0.5 mg/l), streptococcus pneumoniae (mics 0.25-0.5 ml/l), viridans streptococci (mics 0.06-0.5 mg/l) and most enterococci (mics 0.12-0.5 mg/l), although some ampicillin-resistant isolates of str. faecium were slightly less susceptible (mics 2 mg/l). all three of the newer 4-quinolones tested were highly active against enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas sp., haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mics mostly less than 1 mg/l). the other gram-negative aerobes tested were in general somewhat less susceptible, although for acinetobacter and  pseudomonas aeruginosa mics seldom exceeded 8 mg/l. ci-934 was more active than enoxacin against gardnerella vaginalis (mics 1-8 mg/l) although it was a little less active than ciprofloxacin. bacteroides species (including about half of the  fragilis group) were susceptible to ci-934 (mics mostly 1-8 mg/l): ciprofloxacin  had similar activity but enoxacin was less active. other anaerobes tested were mostly highly susceptible to ci-934 (mics 1 mg/l or less) but were somewhat less  susceptible to enoxacin and ciprofloxacin.

TI  == respiratory infections: clinical evaluation.
AB  == a review of clinical studies of piperacillin shows that it is valuable for the treatment of respiratory infections due to enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas sp, anaerobes, and mixed flora including anaerobes. various studies of a total of 420 patients treated with piperacillin for lower respiratory tract infections found that 97% of the patients were cured or markedly improved. piperacillin has also been found as effective as combination therapy (gentamicin or tobramycin plus carbenicillin or ticarcillin) in the treatment of serious infections, including pneumonia and several caused by gram-negative organisms and anaerobic organisms.  a review of the literature on bacteriological responses to piperacillin shows that 126 of 153 (82%) of the susceptible strains could be eradicated. streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, peptostreptococcus sp, bacteroides sp, and fusobacterium sp have been completely  eradicated by treatment with piperacillin. most of the published studies indicate that therapy with the drug is usually well tolerated.

TI  == pathogenicity of encapsulated bacteroides melaninogenicus group, b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the bacteroides melaninogenicus (bm) group and four clinical isolates of b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal abscesses. only 11 isolates of bm group and one b. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). when the other 23 isolates, however, were injected sc in combination with either klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. the bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. capsules also formed in bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of k. pneumoniae or encapsulated bacteroides sp. once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of adenoids in children: a comparison between  patients with chronic adenotonsillitis and adenoid hypertrophy.
AB  == adenoids were obtained from 18 children with chronic adenotonsillitis (group a) and from 12 others with adenoid hypertrophy (group b). patients' ages ranged from 20 months to 15 years (mean 6 years); 18 were males and 12 females. the adenoids  were sectioned in half after heat searing of the surface, and the core material was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were obtained from all patients, yielding an average of 7.8 isolates (4.6 anaerobes and 3.2 aerobes) per specimen. there were 97 anaerobes isolated. the predominant isolates in both groups were: bacteroides sp. (including b. melaninogenicus and b. oralis), fusobacterium sp., gram-positive anaerobic cocci, and veillonella sp. there were 138 aerobic isolates. the predominant isolates in both groups were: alpha and gamma hemolytic streptococci, beta hemolytic streptococci (group a, b, c, and f), s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, and hemophilus sp. hemophilus influenzae type b, and s. aureus were more frequently isolated in group a. b. fragilis was only recovered in group a. beta lactamase production was noted in 27 isolates obtained from 18 patients. fifteen of these patients belonged to group a (83% of group a), while 3 were members of group b (25% of group b). these bacteria were all isolates of s. aureus (11) and b. fragilis (2), 8 of 22 b. melaninogenicus group, 4 of 11 b. oralis, and two of 8 h. influenza type b. our findings indicate the polymicrobial nature of deep adenoid flora and demonstrate the presence of many beta lactamase-producing organisms in children with recurrent adenotonsillitis.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of normal maxillary sinuses.
AB  == the bacterial flora of non-inflamed maxillary sinuses were studied in 12 adults.  patients' median age was 35 years (range 25 to 53 years): 8 were females and 4 were males. aseptic aspiration of the sinus was made when the patients were under general anaesthesia for corrective plastic surgery of the nasal septum. all aspirates were cultured for aerobes and anaerobes. anaerobes were isolated in all 12 specimen patients; in 5 patients (42%), they were the only organisms isolated, and in 7 (58%), they were recovered mixed with aerobes. there were 33 anaerobic isolates (2.75 pr specimen) and the predominant ones were: 11 bacteroides sp. (including 6 b. melaninogenicus), 10 anaerobic gram-positive cocci and 5 fusobacterium sp. there were 16 aerobic isolates (1.3 per specimen) and the predominant ones were: 5 beta hemolytic streptococci, 3 alpha hemolytic streptococci, and 2 each of s. pneumoniae and hemophilus parainfluenzae. beta lactamase production was noted in 4 isolates recovered from 3 patients. these included all isolates of s. aureus (2) and 2 of 6 isolates of b. melaninogenicus. the presence of aerobic and anaerobic organisms in the non-inflamed sinus demonstrates the non-sterility of the sinus cavity. in the events that follow closure of the sinus ostium, these bacteria may become pathogenic.
