in vitro study of beneficial properties and safety of lactic acid bacteria isolated from portuguese fermented meat products.
many lactic acid bacteria produce bacteriocins with a rather broad spectrum of inhibition, which could offer potential applications in food preservation. bacteriocin production by starter cultures may bring advantage to these strains in competitive interactions with pathogenic bacteria from the food matrix. the objective of this study was to determine the safety of beneficial strains (lactobacillus plantarum st202ch and st216ch, enterococcus faecium st211ch, and lactobacillus sakei st22ch, st153ch and st154ch) previously isolated from fermented meat products and characterised as bacteriocin producers. auto-aggregation was strain-specific, and values of 28.97, 27.86 and 28.56% were recorded for l. sakei st22ch, st153ch and st154ch, respectively, 16.95 and 14.58% for l. plantarum st202ch and st216ch, respectively, and 12.77% for e. faecium st211ch. various degrees of co-aggregation between 28.85 and 44.76% for listeria monocytogenes 211 and 409, and between 23.60 to 34.96% for e. faecium atcc 19443 were observed. according to the results of the diffusion method, the studied strains demonstrated susceptibility to penicillin g, ampicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulonic acid, imipenem, linezolid, and tetracycline. in addition, the susceptibility of the six strains to various non-antibiotic commercial drugs was examined. production of beta-galactosidase by l. sakei st22ch, st153ch and st154ch, l. plantarum st202ch and st216ch, and e. faecium st211ch was confirmed by employing sterile filter paper discs impregnated with o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranose. a statistically significant (p<0.001) inhibition of mycobacterium tuberculosis growth by bacteriocins produced by l. plantarum st202ch (38.3%) and st216ch (48.6%), l. sakei st153ch (16.2%) and st154ch (16.1%), and e. faecium st211ch (21.7%) was observed. as determined by the polymerase chain reaction, the tested strains showed a low virulence gene profile.
antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from cheeses and yogurts.
the biopreservation of foods using bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated directly from foods is an innovative approach. the objectives of this study were to isolate and identify bacteriocinogenic lab from various cheeses and yogurts and evaluate their antimicrobial effects on selected spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in vitro as well as on a food commodity.lab were isolated using mrs and m17 media. the agar diffusion bioassay was used to screen for bacteriocin or bacteriocin-like substances (bls) producing lab using lactobacillus sakei and listeria innocua as indicator organisms. out of 138 lab isolates, 28 were found to inhibit these bacteria and were identified as strains of enterococcus faecium, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei using 16s rrna gene sequencing. eight isolates were tested for antimicrobial activity at 5 degrees c and 20 degrees c against l. innocua, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas fluorescens, erwinia carotovora, and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides using the agar diffusion bioassay, and also against penicillium expansum, botrytis cinerea and monilinia frucitcola using the microdilution plate method. the effect of selected lab strains on l. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions was also investigated.twenty percent of our isolates produced bls inhibiting the growth of l. innocua and/or lact. sakei. organic acids and/or h2o2 produced by lab and not the bls had strong antimicrobial effects on all microorganisms tested with the exception of e. coli. ent. faecium, strep. thermophilus and lact. casei effectively inhibited the growth of natural microflora and l. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions. bacteriocinogenic lab present in cheeses and yogurts may have potential to be used as biopreservatives in foods.
isolation and characterisation of selected lactic acid bacteria for improved processing of nem chua, a traditional fermented meat from vietnam.
nem chua is a traditional lactic acid fermented meat of vietnam that is consumed  raw. during fermentation, the number of acid-producing bacteria increased significantly and by the final day (4th), it had reached approximately 8.4 log cfu/g, contributing to 94% of the total microbiota of the product. out of 85 isolates obtained from the product, only 44 were confirmed gram-positive and catalase-negative. these putative lab isolates were purified and screened for antimicrobial and proteolytic activity. none of the isolates showed bacteriocin activity using the 'spot-on lawn' method, but showed antimicrobial activity against lactobacillus sakei and enterococcus faecium using deferred assay. four isolates showed good proteolytic activities at ph 7.0. these isolates were identified as lactobacillus plantarum using an api 50 chl i.d. kit. sequencing of the partial 16s rrna gene amplified by primers 1101f (5'-aacgagcgcaaccc-3') and 1407r (5'-gacgggcggtgtgtac-3') showed 98% homology to lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1.
cloning and heterologous production of hiracin jm79, a sec-dependent bacteriocin  produced by enterococcus hirae dch5, in lactic acid bacteria and pichia pastoris.
hiracin jm79 (hirjm79), a sec-dependent bacteriocin produced by enterococcus hirae dch5, was cloned and produced in lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and pichia pastoris. for heterologous production of hirjm79 in lactic acid bacteria (lab), the hirjm79 structural gene (hirjm79), with or without the hirjm79 immunity gene (hirijm79), was cloned into the plasmid pmg36c under the control of the constitutive promoter p(32) and into the plasmid pnz8048 under the control of the inducible p(nisa) promoter. for the production of hirjm79 in p. pastoris, the gene encoding the mature hirjm79 protein was cloned into the ppiczalphaa expression vector. the recombinant plasmids permitted the production of biologically active hirjm79 in the supernatants of l. lactis il1403, l. lactis nz9000, l. sakei lb790, e. faecalis jh2-2, and p. pastoris x-33, the coproduction of hirjm79 and nisin a in l. lactis dpc5598, and the coproduction of hirjm79 and enterocin p in e. faecium l50/14-2. all recombinant lab produced larger quantities of hirjm79 than e. hirae dch5, although the antimicrobial activities of most transformants were lower than that predicted from their production of hirjm79. the synthesis, processing, and secretion of hirjm79 proceed efficiently in recombinant lab strains and p. pastoris.
efficacy of nisin in combination with protective cultures against listeria monocytogenes scott a in tofu.
nisin can be used as a biopreservative to control growth of listeria monocytogenes in various minimally processed foods. tofu is an example of a non-fermented soybean product, which may allow growth of listeria at refrigeration temperatures and in which nisin may be applied to prevent multiplication of listeria. the efficacy of nisin against listeria may be compromised by the emergence of spontaneous nisin-resistant mutants. exposure of l. monocytogenes scott a to nisin in a culture medium or in a food product results in an initial reduction of listeria population which is followed by regrowth of survivors to nisin during further incubation. in vitro studies using standard i nutrient broth showed that enterococcus faecium bfe 900-6a and lactobacillus sakei lb 706-1a used as protective cultures in combination with nisin were able to suppress proliferation of listeria cells not killed by nisin at 10 degrees c. growth and bacteriocin production of these two strains and a third protective culture, lactococcus lactis bfe 902 was also observed in soymilk and tofu at 10 degrees c. inoculation studies with tofu prepared with nisin and protective cultures showed that lower amounts of nisin are required for an effective inhibition of l. monocytogenes scott a when either e. faecium bfe 900-6a or lc. lactis bfe 902 are used in addition. the combination of nisin with these bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (lab) resulted in a complete suppression of listerial growth in homemade tofu stored at 10 degrees c for 1 week. lb. sakei lb 706-1a was less effective and did not prevent a slight increase of l. monocytogenes scott a numbers during storage.
