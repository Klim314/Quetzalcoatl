TI  - Streptococci from root canals in teeth with apical periodontitis receiving endodontic treatment.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The object of this study was to investigate the diversity among streptococcal species isolated from root canals in conjunction with endodontic therapy and to characterize their production of extracellular proteins. STUDY DESIGN: Consecutive root canal samples (RCS) taken as bacteriological controls during root canal treatment of teeth with apical periodontitis were analyzed in a total of 100 clinical cases. Bacteria were isolated and classified by selective media and gas liquid chromatography. Streptococcal strains were identified by carbohydrate fermentation, hydrolysis of aesculin/arginine, and production of enzymes. Releases of extracellular proteins by streptococci and Enterococcus spp in fluid culture media were examined with SDS-PAGE and 2-dimension gel electrophoresis (2 DE). Extracellular proteins produced were quantified and qualitatively analyzed. Specific proteins were targeted with Western immunoblot assays. Comparisons were made with type strains. RESULTS: Of a total of 241 bacterial strains recovered in the first samples submitted, Streptococcus gordonii, S anginosus, and S oralis were the most frequently isolated streptococci. In 49 of 89 resubmitted samples showing bacterial growth, S gordonii and S oralis still predominated among streptococci. Other common bacterial isolates were Enterococcus spp, Lactobacillus paracasei, and Olsenella uli. Quantitative and qualitative differences in extracellular protein production were observed among clinical isolates and laboratory streptococcal strains. In similar conditions for growth, S intermedius, S anginosus, S oralis, and S gordonii were strong producers of extracellular proteins (>3.0 microg/mL), while Enterococcus spp and S mutans were weak. Whole cell protein extracts showed a different profile from that of extracellular proteins. The chaperone protein DnaK was recognized to be produced extracellularly by S gordonii, S oralis, S anginosus, and S parasanguis. CONCLUSIONS: Being strong producers of extracellular proteins and by virtue of common presence in teeth undergoing endodontic therapy, S gordonii, S anginosus, and S oralis may be of pathogenic significance in posttreatment apical periodontitis.
