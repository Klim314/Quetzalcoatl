TI  == nitrate-dependent degradation of acetone by alicycliphilus and paracoccus strains and comparison of acetone carboxylase enzymes.
AB  == a novel acetone-degrading, nitrate-reducing bacterium, strain kn bun08, was isolated from an enrichment culture with butanone and nitrate as the sole sources of carbon and energy. the cells were motile short rods, 0.5 to 1 by 1 to 2 mum in size, which gave gram-positive staining results in the exponential growth phase and gram-negative staining results in the stationary-growth phase. based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, the isolate was assigned to the genus alicycliphilus. besides butanone and acetone, the strain used numerous fatty acids as substrates. an atp-dependent acetone-carboxylating enzyme was enriched from cell extracts of this bacterium and of alicycliphilus denitrificans k601(t)  by two subsequent deae sepharose column procedures. for comparison, acetone carboxylases were enriched from two additional nitrate-reducing bacterial species, paracoccus denitrificans and p. pantotrophus. the products of the carboxylase reaction were acetoacetate and amp rather than adp. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) analysis of cell extracts and of the various enzyme preparations revealed bands corresponding to molecular  masses of 85, 78, and 20 kda, suggesting similarities to the acetone carboxylase  enzymes described in detail for the aerobic bacterium xanthobacter autotrophicus  strain py2 (85.3, 78.3, and 19.6 kda) and the phototrophic bacterium rhodobacter  capsulatus. protein bands were excised and compared by mass spectrometry with those of acetone carboxylases of aerobic bacteria. the results document the finding that the nitrate-reducing bacteria studied here use acetone-carboxylating enzymes similar to those of aerobic and phototrophic bacteria.

TI  == the appa and ppsr proteins from rhodobacter sphaeroides can establish a redox-dependent signal chain but fail to transmit blue-light signals in other bacteria.
AB  == the appa protein of rhodobacter sphaeroides has the unique ability to sense and transmit redox and light signals. in response to decreasing oxygen tension, appa  antagonizes the transcriptional regulator ppsr, which represses the expression of photosynthesis genes, including the puc operon. this mechanism, which is based on direct protein-protein interaction, is prevented by blue-light absorption of the  bluf domain located in the n-terminal part of appa. in order to test whether appa and ppsr are sufficient to transmit redox and light signals, we expressed these proteins in three different bacterial species and monitored oxygen- and blue-light-dependent puc expression either directly or by using a luciferase-based reporter construct. the appa/ppsr system could mediate redox-dependent gene expression in the alphaproteobacteria rhodobacter capsulatus and paracoccus denitrificans but not in the gammaproteobacterium escherichia coli. analysis of a prra mutant strain of r. sphaeroides strongly suggests that light-dependent gene expression requires a balanced interplay of the appa/ppsr system with the prra response regulator. therefore, the appa/ppsr system was unable to establish light signaling in other bacteria. based on our data, we present a model for the interdependence of appa/ppsr signaling and the prra transcriptional activator.

TI  == use of sinorhizobium meliloti as an indicator for specific detection of long-chain n-acyl homoserine lactones.
AB  == population-density-dependent gene expression in gram-negative bacteria involves the production of signal molecules characterized as n-acyl homoserine lactones (ahls). the synthesis of ahls by numerous microorganisms has been identified by using biosensor strains based on the agrobacterium tumefaciens and chromobacterium violaceum quorum-sensing systems. the symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterium sinorhizobium meliloti is rapidly becoming a model organism for the study of quorum sensing. this organism harbors at least three different quorum-sensing systems (sin, mel, and tra), which play a role in its symbiotic relationship with its host plant, alfalfa. the sin system is distinguished among  them for the production of long-chain ahls, including c(18)-hl, the longest ahl reported so far. in this work, we show that construction of a sini::lacz transcriptional fusion results in a strain that detects long-chain ahls with exquisite sensitivity. overexpression of the sinr regulator protein from a vector promoter increases its sensitivity without loss of specificity. we also show that the resulting indicator strain can recognize long-chain ahls produced by unrelated bacteria such as paracoccus denitrificans and rhodobacter capsulatus. this s. meliloti indicator strain should serve as a tool for the specific detection of long-chain ahls in new systems.

TI  == the mitochondrial and prokaryotic proton-translocating nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductases: similarities and dissimilarities of the quinone-junction sites.
AB  == the catalytic properties of the rotenone-sensitive nadh:ubiquinone reductase (complex i) in bovine heart submitochondrial particles and in inside-out vesicles derived from paracoccus denitrificans and rhodobacter capsulatus were compared. the prokaryotic enzymes catalyze the nadh oxidase and nadh:quinone reductase reactions with similar kinetic parameters as those for the mammalian complex i, except for lower apparent affinities for the substrates--nucleotides. unidirectional competitive inhibition of nadh oxidation by adp-ribose, previously discovered for submitochondrial particles, was also evident for tightly coupled p. denitrificans vesicles, thus suggesting that a second, nad(+)-specific site is present in the simpler prokaryotic enzyme. the inhibitor sensitivity of the forward and reverse electron transfer reactions was compared. in p. denitrificans and bos taurus vesicles different sensitivities to rotenone and triton x-100 for  the forward and reverse electron transfer reactions were found. in bovine heart preparations, both reactions showed the same sensitivity to piericidin, and the inhibition was titrated as a straight line. in p. denitrificans, the forward and  reverse reactions show different sensitivity to piericidin and the titrations of  both activities were curvilinear with apparent i(50) (expressed as mole of inhibitor per mole of enzyme) independent of the enzyme concentration. this behavior is explained by a model involving two different sites rapidly interacting with piericidin within the hydrophobic phase.

TI  == characterization of the interaction of rhodobacter capsulatus cytochrome c peroxidase with charge reversal mutants of cytochrome c(2).
AB  == steady-state kinetics for the reaction of rhodobacter capsulatus bacterial cytochrome c peroxidase (bccp) with its substrate cytochrome c(2) were investigated. the rb. capsulatus bccp is dependent on calcium for activation as previously shown for the pseudomonas aeruginosa bccp and paracoccus denitrificans enzymes. furthermore, the activity shows a bell-shaped ph dependence with optimum at ph 7.0. enzyme activity is greatest at low ionic strength and drops off steeply as ionic strength increases, resulting in an apparent interaction domain  charge product of -13. all cytochromes c(2) show an asymmetric distribution of surface charge, with a concentration of 14 positive charges near the exposed heme edge of rb. capsulatus c(2) which potentially may interact with approximately 6 negative charges, localized near the edge of the high-potential heme of the rb. capsulatus bccp. to test this proposal, we constructed charge reversal mutants of the 14 positively charged residues located on the front face of rb. capsulatus cytochrome c(2) and examined their effect on steady-state kinetics with bccp. mutated residues in rb. capsulatus cytochrome c(2) that showed the greatest effects on binding and enzyme activity are k12e, k14e, k54e, k84e, k93e, and k99e, which is consistent with the site of electron transfer being located at the heme edge. we conclude that a combination of long-range, nonspecific electrostatic interactions as well as localized salt bridges between, e.g., cytochrome c(2) k12, k14, k54, and k99 with bccp d194, d241, and d6, account for  the observed kinetics.

TI  == long-chain acyl-homoserine lactone quorum-sensing regulation of rhodobacter capsulatus gene transfer agent production.
AB  == many proteobacteria use acyl-homoserine lactones as quorum-sensing signals. traditionally, biological detection systems have been used to identify bacteria that produce acyl-homoserine lactones, although the specificities of these detection systems can limit discovery. we used a sensitive approach that did not  require a bioassay to detect production of long-acyl-chain homoserine lactone production by rhodobacter capsulatus and paracoccus denitrificans. these long-chain acyl-homoserine lactones are not readily detected by standard bioassays. the most abundant acyl-homoserine lactone was n-hexadecanoyl-homoserine lactone. the long-chain acyl-homoserine lactones were concentrated in cells but were also found in the culture fluid. an r. capsulatus  gene responsible for long-chain acyl-homoserine lactone synthesis was identified. a mutation in this gene, which we named gtai, resulted in decreased production of the r. capsulatus gene transfer agent, and gene transfer agent production was restored by exogenous addition of n-hexadecanoyl-homoserine lactone. thus, long-chain acyl-homoserine lactones serve as quorum-sensing signals to enhance genetic exchange in r. capsulatus.

TI  == characteristics of the aerobic respiratory chains of the microaerophiles campylobacter jejuni and helicobacter pylori.
AB  == the respiratory chain enzymes of microaerophilic bacteria should play a major role in their adaptation to growth at low oxygen tensions. the genes encoding the putative nadh:quinone reductases (ndh-1), the ubiquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductases (bc1 complex) and the terminal oxidases of the microaerophiles campylobacter jejuni and helicobacter pylori were analysed to identify structural elements that may be required for their unique energy metabolism. the gene clusters encoding ndh-1 in both c. jejuni and h. pylori lacked nuoe and nuof, and in their place were genes encoding two unknown proteins. the nuog subunit in these microaerophilic bacteria appeared to have an additional fe-s cluster that is not present in ndh-1 from other organisms; but c. jejuni and h. pylori differed from each other in a cysteine-rich segment in this subunit, which is present in some but not all ndh-1. both organisms lacked genes orthologous to those encoding ndh-2. the subunits of the bc1 complex of both bacteria were similar, and the rieske fe-s and cytochrome b subunits had significant similarity to those of paracoccus denitrificans and rhodobacter capsulatus, well-studied bacterial bc1 complexes. the composition of the terminal oxidases of c. jejuni and h. pylori was different; both bacteria had cytochrome cbb3 oxidases, but c. jejuni also contained a bd-type quinol oxidase. the primary structures of the major subunits of the cbb3-type (terminal) oxidase of c. jejuni and h. pylori indicated that they form a separate group within the cbb3 protein family. the implications of the results for the function of the enzymes and their adaptation  to microaerophilic growth are discussed.

TI  == characterization of an azospirillum brasilense tn5 mutant with enhanced n(2) fixation: the effect of orf280 on nifh expression.
AB  == disruption of an open reading frame (orf) of 840 bp (280 amino acids; orf280) in  an azospirillum brasilense tn5 mutant resulted in a pleiotrophic phenotype. besides an enhanced n(2)-fixing capacity and altered expression pattern of a nifh-gusa fusion, growth on the charged polar amino acids glutamate and arginine  was severely affected. orf280, similar to previously identified orfs present in bradyrhizobium japonicum (orf277), paracoccus denitrificans (orf278) and rhodobacter capsulatus (orf277), exhibits in its c-terminus a significant similarity with the recently defined family of universal stress proteins.

TI  == mutational analysis of the dimethylsulfoxide respiratory (dor) operon of rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == four genes, dorc, dord, dorb and dorr of the dmso respiratory gene cluster of rhodobacter capsulatus have been identified and sequenced. dorc encodes a pentahaem c-type cytochrome of the nirt class and the derived dorc protein sequence shows highest similarity to torc from the escherichia coli trimethylamine-n-oxide (tmao) respiratory system. mutagenesis of dorc resulted in the loss of a 46 kda haem-staining polypeptide from membranes of r. capsulatus. dord encodes a protein with highest sequence similarity to tord from the e. coli  tmao respiratory system. dmso reductase polypeptide (dora) could not be detected  in cell-free extracts of a dord mutant and it is suggested that dord has a role in stabilizing the dora apo-protein prior to insertion of the pterin molybdenum cofactor. dorb encodes a protein with highest sequence similarity to napd of paracoccus denitrificans. mutagenesis of dorb reduced the activity of dmso reductase and led to the accumulation of a larger form of the enzyme that is presumed to represent a cytoplasmic precursor polypeptide. it is suggested that dorb has a role in the biogenesis of dmso reductase prior to its secretion into the periplasm. dorr is transcribed in the opposite direction to dorc. the derived amino acid sequence of dorr indicates that it is a response regulator and mutation of dorr shows that it is essential for expression of the dorcda operon.  expression of a chromosomal dora::lacz fusion was also dependent on the transcriptional regulator fnr. the intergenic region between dorr and dorc contains four putative binding sites for dorr but no binding site for fnr was identified.

TI  == characterization of cytochrome c-556 from the purple phototrophic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus as a cytochrome-c peroxidase.
AB  == a cytochrome c-556 was purified from rhodobacter capsulatus and the complete amino acid sequence was determined. it contains 328 amino acid residues and two typical heme-binding sites at cysteine residues 54 and 57 and at residues 200 and 203. it is homologous to the family of bacterial cytochrome c peroxidases (bccp)  with 69% identity to paracoccus denitrificans bccp and 60% identity to pseudomonas aeruginosa bccp for which there is a three-dimensional structure. there is lesser similarity to the maug gene products from methylotrophic bacteria which are thought to be involved in biosynthesis of the quinone cofactor of methylamine dehydrogenase. translated genes from escherichia coli and helicobacter pylori are also related to the bacterial cytochrome c peroxidases. the divergence of this family of proteins is reflected in the fact that the reported sixth heme ligands are not conserved, except in pseudomonas, rhodobacter and paracoccus. this suggests that homologs of bccp may fold differently and/or may not have the same enzymatic activity as the prototypic protein from ps. aeruginosa. we found that the rb. capsulatus bccp is active with both rb. capsulatus cytochrome c2 and with horse cytochrome c as substrates (km values 60  microm and 6 microm, respectively). the turnover number was 40 s(-1) and the km for peroxide was 33 microm. we have thus confirmed that the rb. capsulatus protein is a cytochrome c peroxidase.

TI  == molecular genetics of the genus paracoccus: metabolically versatile bacteria with bioenergetic flexibility.
AB  == paracoccus denitrificans and its near relative paracoccus versutus (formerly known as thiobacilllus versutus) have been attracting increasing attention because the aerobic respiratory system of p. denitrificans has long been regarded as a model for that of the mitochondrion, with which there are many components (e.g., cytochrome aa3 oxidase) in common. members of the genus exhibit a great range of metabolic flexibility, particularly with respect to processes involving  respiration. prominent examples of flexibility are the use in denitrification of  nitrate, nitrite, nitrous oxide, and nitric oxide as alternative electron acceptors to oxygen and the ability to use c1 compounds (e.g., methanol and methylamine) as electron donors to the respiratory chains. the proteins required  for these respiratory processes are not constitutive, and the underlying complex  regulatory systems that regulate their expression are beginning to be unraveled.  there has been uncertainty about whether transcription in a member of the alpha-3 proteobacteria such as p. denitrificans involves a conventional sigma70-type rna  polymerase, especially since canonical -35 and -10 dna binding sites have not been readily identified. in this review, we argue that many genes, in particular  those encoding constitutive proteins, may be under the control of a sigma70 rna polymerase very closely related to that of rhodobacter capsulatus. while the main focus is on the structure and regulation of genes coding for products involved in respiratory processes in paracoccus, the current state of knowledge of the components of such respiratory pathways, and their biogenesis, is also reviewed.

TI  == iron-sulfur clusters/semiquinones in complex i.
AB  == nadh-quinone 1 oxidoreductase (complex i) isolated from bovine heart mitochondria was, until recently, the major source for the study of this most complicated energy transducing device in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. complex i has been shown to contain 43 subunits and possesses a molecular mass of about 1 million. recently, complex i genes have been cloned and sequenced from several bacterial sources including escherichia coli, paracoccus denitrificans, rhodobacter capsulatus and thermus thermophilus hb-8. these enzymes are less complicated than the bovine enzyme, containing a core of 13 or 14 subunits homologous to the bovine heart complex i. from this data, important clues concerning the subunit location of both the substrate binding site and intrinsic  redox centers have been gleaned. powerful molecular genetic approaches used in these bacterial systems can identify structure/function relationships concerning  the redox components of complex i. site-directed mutants at the level of bacterial chromosomes and over-expression and purification of single subunits have allowed detailed analysis of the amino acid residues involved in ligand binding to several iron-sulfur clusters. therefore, it has become possible to examine which subunits contain individual iron-sulfur clusters, their location within the enzyme and what their ligand residues are. the discovery of g=2.00 epr signals arising from two distinct species of semiquinone (sq) in the activated bovine heart submitochondrial particles (smp) is another line of recent progress. the intensity of semiquinone signals is sensitive to deltamicroh+ and is diminished by specific inhibitors of complex i. to date, semiquinones similar to  those reported for the bovine heart mitochondrial complex i have not yet been discovered in the bacterial systems. this mini-review describes three aspects of  the recent progress in the study of the redox components of complex i: (a) the location of the substrate (nadh) binding site, flavin, and most of the iron-sulfur clusters, which have been identified in the hydrophilic electron entry domain of complex i; (b) experimental evidence indicating that the cluster  n2 is located in the amphipathic domain of complex i, connecting the promontory and membrane parts. very recent data is also presented suggesting that the cluster n2 may have a unique ligand structure with an atypical cluster-ligation sequence motif located in the nuob (nqo6/psst) subunit rather than in the long advocated nuoi (nqo9/tyky) subunit. the latter subunit contains the most primordial sequence motif for two tetranuclear clusters; (c) the discovery of spin-spin interactions between cluster n2 and two distinct complex i-associated species of semiquinone. based on the splitting of the g1 signal of the cluster n2 and concomitant strong enhancement of the semiquinone spin relaxation, one semiquinone species was localized 8-11 a from the cluster n2 within the inner membrane on the matrix side (n-side). spin relaxation of the other semiquinone species is much less enhanced, and thus it was proposed to have a longer distance from the cluster n2, perhaps located closer to the other side (p-side) surface of the membrane. a brief introduction of epr technique was also described in appendix a of this mini-review.

TI  == isolation and characterization of rhodobacter capsulatus mutants affected in cytochrome cbb3 oxidase activity.
AB  == the facultative phototrophic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus contains only one form of cytochrome (cyt) c oxidase, which has recently been identified as a cbb3-type cyt c oxidase. this is unlike other related species, such as rhodobacter sphaeroides and paracoccus denitrificans, which contain an additional mitochondrial-like aa3-type cyt c oxidase. an extensive search for mutants affected in cyt c oxidase activity in r. capsulatus led to the isolation of at least five classes of mutants. plasmids complementing them to a wild-type phenotype were obtained for all but one of these classes from a chromosomal dna library. the first class of mutants contained mutations within the structural genes (cconoqp) of the cyt cbb3 oxidase. sequence analysis of these mutants and of the plasmids complementing them revealed that cconoqp in r. capsulatus is not  flanked by the oxygen response regulator fnr, which is located upstream of these  genes in other species. genetic and biochemical characterizations of mutants belonging to this group indicated that the subunits ccon, ccoo, and ccop are required for the presence of an active cyt cbb3 oxidase, and unlike in bradyrhizobium japonicum, no active ccon-ccoo subcomplex was found in r. capsulatus. in addition, mutagenesis experiments indicated that the highly conserved open reading frame 277 located adjacent to cconoqp is required neither  for cyt cbb3 oxidase activity or assembly nor for respiratory or photosynthetic energy transduction in r. capsulatus. the remaining cyt c oxidase-minus mutants mapped outside of cconoqp and formed four additional groups. in one of these groups, a fully assembled but inactive cyt cbb3 oxidase was found, while another  group had only extremely small amounts of it. the next group was characterized by a pleiotropic effect on all membrane-bound c-type cytochromes, and the remaining  mutants not complemented by the plasmids complementing the first four groups formed at least one additional group affecting the biogenesis of the cyt cbb3 oxidase of r. capsulatus.

TI  == protein and gene structure of the nadh-binding fragment of rhodobacter capsulatus nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase.
AB  == membranes of aerobically grown rhodobacter capsulatus contain only one type of nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase which is homologous to the proton-translocating complex i. the k(m) value of the enzyme for nadh was determined to be 8 microm. after solubilization of the membranes with an alkylglucoside detergent, two fragments of complex i with molecular masses of 110 kda and 140 kda were isolated by chromatographic steps in the presence of detergent. both fragments contain at  least two polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 46 kda and 42 kda. fmn was identified as cofactor in the preparations. degenerative oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify a part of the sequence coding for the nadh-binding subunit of complex i by pcr. with the pcr product as probe, a genomic fragment was cloned and sequenced containing the genes encoding the two purified polypeptides and additional reading frames. the two genes are named nuoe and nuof and are homologous to nqo2 and nqo1 of paracoccus denitrificans. however, nuoe contains a c-terminal extension of 149 amino acids compared with nqo2. nuoe and nuof have molecular masses of 41259 da and 47133 da and contain the nadh-, fmn- and fes-cluster-binding motifs.

TI  == molecular cloning and functional characterization of the paracoccus denitrificans porin.
AB  == bacterial porins facilitate the passive uptake of small solutes across the outer  membrane of the cell. the channel properties and the primary structure of the porin from paracoccus denitrificans were investigated. as judged from single-channel conductance experiments, this porin forms trimeric pores that show no ion selectivity in potassium chloride solution, which indicates that the charges within or near the channel are balanced. based on peptide fragment sequence, the gene porg, which codes for this general pore protein, was cloned and analyzed. its primary translation product contains a 20-residue signal sequence, followed by the 295 amino acids of the mature protein with a molecular  mass of 31.9 kda. sequence alignments with porins from rhodopseudomonas blastica  and rhodobacter capsulatus and secondary structure predictions suggest a typical  rigid barrel structure consisting of 16 antiparallel beta-strands.

TI  == mo(v) electron paramagnetic resonance signals from the periplasmic nitrate reductase of thiosphaera pantotropha.
AB  == a mo(v) electron paramagnetic resonance (epr) study of the periplasmic respiratory nitrate reductase of the denitrifying bacterium thiosphaera pantotropha has revealed that the molybdenum centre of this enzyme is very similar to that in the assimilatory nitrate reductase of azotobacter vinelandii but is somewhat different from that of the membrane-bound bacterial respiratory nitrate reductases such as those of escherichia coli and paracoccus denitrificans. we have identified the mo(v) species most likely to be the catalytically relevant one and characterised two other sets of mo(v) epr signals. as well as exhibiting epr signals with g values typical of bacterial molybdenum-containing reductases, molybdenum-hydroxylase-like epr signals can be  elicited in the nitrate reductase of t. pantotropha upon treatment with excess dithionite. the only other enzyme known to display this phenomenon is the periplasmic dimethylsulphoxide reductase of rhodobacter capsulatus. a mechanism for the generation of these signals is proposed which invokes reduction of the pterin ring of the molybdenum cofactor linked to gmp from the dihydro to the tetrahydro state. the possibilities and implications of there being cysteine ligands to the molybdenum centres of these two enzymes are discussed.

TI  == bacterial genes and proteins involved in the biogenesis of c-type cytochromes and terminal oxidases.
AB  == a total of nine genes potentially concerned with the biosynthesis of c-type cytochromes have been identified recently in the bacteria bradyrhizobium japonicum and rhodobacter capsulatus, and homologous counterparts appear to be present also in escherichia coli. most of the respective gene products are membrane-bound, while others are located in the periplasmic space. as inferred from sequence analyses, several of these proteins may play roles in membrane transport or redox processes, both functions being consistent with the required steps in cytochrome c formation (membrane translocation of heme; covalent linkage of protoheme ix to cysteine thiols). further genes of b. japonicum, e. coli, bacillus subtilis and paracoccus denitrificans have been studied whose products are necessary for the formation of intact heme/copper oxidases. some of them are  probably required in protein folding and assembly whereas others appear to be enzymes catalyzing steps in the biosynthesis of the heme cofactors.

TI  == purification and characterization of the periplasmic nitrate reductase from thiosphaera pantotropha.
AB  == the periplasmic nitrate reductase of thiosphaera pantotropha has been purified from a mutant strain (m-6) that overproduces the enzyme activity under anaerobic  growth conditions. the enzyme is a complex of a 93-kda polypeptide and a 16-kda nitrate-oxidizable cytochrome c552. the complex contains molybdenum; a fluorescent compound with spectral features of a pterin derivative can be extracted. in contrast to the dissimilatory membrane-bound nitrate reductases, the periplasmic nitrate reductase shows high specificity for nitrate as a substrate and is insensitive to inhibition by azide. the 93-kda subunit exhibits  immunological cross-reactivity with the catalytic subunit of rhodobacter capsulatus n22dnar+ periplasmic nitrate reductase. mass spectrometric comparisons of holo-cytochrome c552 and apo-cytochrome c552 demonstrated that the polypeptide bound two haem groups. mediated redox potentiometry of the cytochrome indicated that the haem groups have reduction potentials (ph = 7.0) of approximately -15 mv and + 80 mv. the functional significance of these potentials is discussed in relation to the proposed physiological role of the enzyme as a redox valve.

TI  == identification of the dna region responsible for sulfur-oxidizing ability of thiosphaera pantotropha.
AB  == for the identification of the dna region responsible for the sulfur-oxidizing ability (sox) of thiosphaera pantotropha, we used previously isolated tn5-mob insertional sox- mutants. for seven mutants, the tn5-mob insertion was localized  on the chromosome rather than on the megaplasmids phg41 or phg42 by using the tn5-mob-harboring vehicle psup5011 as probe. the specific insertion of tn5-mob into a sox gene was determined for one sox- mutant, strain tp19. an 18-kb ecori fragment was cloned in escherichia coli by using the mobilizable plasmid psup202  as vector and the kanamycin resistance gene of tn5 as marker. conjugal transfer of the resulting hybrid plasmid, pks3-13, to the wild type resulted in two phenotypically different groups of recombinants. ninety-five percent of the recombinants were sox+, kanamycin resistant, and tetracycline resistant; 5% were  homogenote recombinants exhibiting the sox-, kanamycin-resistant, tetracycline-sensitive phenotype, and these indicated the specific insertion. to  isolate the respective wild-type sox gene, total dna from a heterogenote recombinant was partially restricted with ecori, religated, and transformed in e. coli. transformants carrying a psup202-derived hybrid plasmid with the intact sox gene were identified by screening for a tetracycline-resistant, kanamycin-sensitive, and chloramphenicol-sensitive phenotype and by complementation of the sox- mutant tp19. a plasmid of this type, peg12, contained an insert of 13 kb which gave a positive signal in southern hybridization with the homologous probe of pks3-13. peg12 was used to determine the dna homology of  the sulfur-oxidizing enzyme systems of other thiobacteria. strong hybridization signals were obtained with total dna of the neutrophilic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria paracoccus denitrificans, thiobacillus versutus, and rhodobacter capsulatus. no hybridization signal was obtained with dna of other neutrophilic or acidophilic thiobacteria examined.

AB  == cytochrome c' was identified in periplasmic extracts of the paracoccus denitrificans strains lmd 22.21 and lmd 52.44. the cytochrome c' was purified from the latter using the device of sequential molecular exclusion chromatography in the dimeric and monomeric states. although showing the overall spectroscopic features of the cytochrome c' family, the paracoccus cytochrome c' is unusual in  having a red-shifted oxidised soret band at 407 nm. also unusual is the midpoint  potential of 202 mv, well above the known cytochrome c' range. the amino-acid composition of pa. denitrificans cytochrome c' showed the high alanine and low proline content characteristic of the group and reflecting the predominantly alpha-helical character of the protein. comparison of the amino-acid compositions suggests some similarity to the cytochromes c' of chromatium vinosum and halotolerant paracoccus.

TI  == cytochrome c2 is essential for electron transfer to nitrous oxide reductase from  physiological substrates in rhodobacter capsulatus and can act as an electron donor to the reductase in vitro. correlation with photoinhibition studies.
AB  == 1. addition of nitrous oxide to a periplasmic fraction released from rhodobacter  capsulatus strains mt1131, n22dnar+ or ad2 caused oxidation of c-type cytochrome, as judged by the decrease in absorbance at 550 nm. the periplasmic fraction catalysed reduction of nitrous oxide in the presence of either isoascorbate plus  phenazine ethosulphate or reduced methyl viologen. the rates with these two electron donors were similar and were comparable to the activity observed with a  quantity of cells equivalent to those from which the periplasm sample had been derived. activity in the periplasm could not be observed with ascorbate plus 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine although this reductant was effective with intact cells treated with myxothiazol to block the activity of the cytochrome-bc1 complex. 2. cells of r. capsulatus mtg4/s4, a mutant from which the gene for cytochrome c2 has been specifically deleted, did not catalyse detectable rates of nitrous-oxide reduction. a nitrous-oxide reductase activity was present, as shown by activity of both cells and a periplasmic fraction with isoascorbate plus phenazine ethosulphate as reductant. the rates in cells and the periplasmic fraction were similar to those observed in the corresponding wild-type strain (mt1131). in contrast to wild-type cells, 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine  and n,n,n',n'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine [ph(nme2)2] were ineffective as mediators of electrons from isoascorbate. visible absorption spectra showed that  no detectable cytochromes in either the periplasm or intact cells of the mtg4/s4  mutant were oxidised by nitrous oxide. 3. purified ferroycytochrome c2 from r. capsulatus was oxidised by nitrous oxide in the presence of periplasm from r. capsulatus mtg4/s4. the rate of oxidation was proportional to the amount of periplasm added, but was considerably lower than the rate of nitrous-oxide reduction observed with the same periplasmic fraction when either ascorbate plus  phenazine ethosulphate or reduced methyl viologen were used as substrates. the oxidation of cytochrome c2 was inhibited by acetylene and by low concentrations of nacl. 4. oxidation of ferrocytochrome c2 by nitrous oxide was observed when the purified cytochrome was mixed with a preparation of nitrous-oxide reductase.  however, oxidation of ferrocytochrome c' by nitrous oxide was not observed in the presence of the reductase. the observations with the mutant mtg4/s4 suggest that  cytochrome c2 is the only periplasmic cytochrome involved in nitrous-oxide reduction. 5. nitrous-oxide-dependent oxidation of a c-type cytochrome was observed in a periplasmic fraction from paracoccus denitrificans, provided the fraction was first reduced.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == different lipid a types in lipopolysaccharides of phototrophic and related non-phototrophic bacteria.
AB  == lipid a analyses confirm not only the present taxa of the purple nonsulfur bacteria (formerly rhodospirillaceae), but also phylogenetical relatedness of distinct phototrophic to distinct non-phototrophic bacteria, as was suggested by  cataloguing 16s rrna. for example, lipid a with ester-bound 3-oh-10:0 and the rare amide-linked 3-oxo-14:0 is common to the phototrophic rhodobacter capsulatus and rhodobacter sphaeroides and also to paracoccus denitrificans and thiobacillus versutus. 'lipid adag' (lipid a with 2,3-diamino-d-glucose (dag)) occurs in the phototrophic rhodopseudomonas viridis and rhodopseudomonas palustris and also in  the related non-phototrophic species, e.g., nitrobacter winogradskyi, pseudomonas diminuta, or thiobacillus ferrooxidans. the phylogenetically more coherent purple sulfur bacteria (chromatiaceae) uniformly contain d-mannose in their phosphate-free lipid a. among the green bacteria, only the chlorobiaceae but not  the likewise chlorosome-containing chloroflexaceae contain lipopolysaccharide. lipid adag from r. viridis is a structural analogue of a biosynthetic precursor (lipid x) of enterobacterial lipid a. lipid a synthase from salmonella accepts not only lipid x but also the synthetic di-n-acyl-2,3-diamino-d-glucose analogue  as substrate (raetz, c.r.h., unpublished results). more and more naturally occurring lipid a's with both, 2,3-diaminoglucose and glucosamine ('mixed' lipid  a, with 2,3-diaminoglucose or glucosamine dominating) are being found. newly recognized lipid a and lipid adag types might offer the possibility of differentially stimulating desired biological activities in animals without also  having the undesired endotoxic activities. the non-toxic lipid a from rhodopseudomonas viridis for example is able to stimulate prostaglandin secretion in peritoneal macrophages and can be used as an antagonist to the endotoxic shock caused by salmonella lipopolysaccharide.

TI  == complete amino acid sequence of cytochrome c551 from erythrobacter species strain och 114.
AB  == the complete amino acid sequence of cytochrome c551 isolated from an aerobic photosynthetic bacterium, erythrobacter sp. strain och 114, was determined. the cytochrome molecule was composed of a total of 119 amino acid residues and its molecular weight including heme was calculated to be 13,235. the sequence was (sequence: see text). its molecular weight indicates that this cytochrome is of the l-type. sequence alignment with other bacterial cytochromes c shows that this cytochrome is similar to cytochromes c of rhodobacter capsulatus, rhodobacter sphaeroides, and paracoccus denitrificans, which were grouped into the alpha-3 subcluster from the 16s rrna sequence analysis.
