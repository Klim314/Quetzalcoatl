TI  == consumption of human milk oligosaccharides by gut-related microbes.
AB  == human milk contains large amounts of complex oligosaccharides that putatively modulate the intestinal microbiota of breast-fed infants by acting as decoy binding sites for pathogens and as prebiotics for enrichment of beneficial bacteria. several bifidobacterial species have been shown to grow well on human milk oligosaccharides. however, few data exist on other bacterial species. this work examined 16 bacterial strains belonging to 10 different genera for growth on human milk oligosaccharides. for this propose, a chemically defined medium, zmb1, was used, which allows vigorous growth of a number of gut-related microorganisms  in a fashion similar to complex media. interestingly, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, bacteroides fragilis , and bacteroides vulgatus strains were able to metabolize milk oligosaccharides with high efficiency, whereas enterococcus , streptococcus , veillonella , eubacterium , clostridium , and escherichia coli strains grew less well or not at all. mass spectrometry-based glycoprofiling of the oligosaccharide consumption behavior revealed a specific preference for fucosylated oligosaccharides by bi. longum subsp. infantis and ba. vulgatus. this work expands the current knowledge of human milk oligosaccharide consumption by gut microbes, revealing bacteroides as avid consumers of this substrate. these results provide insight on how human milk oligosaccharides shape the infant intestinal microbiota.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == effect of intestinal bacteria on incidence of liver tumors in gnotobiotic c3h/he  male mice.
AB  == the effect of intestinal microflora on liver tumorigenesis was studied in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice monoassociated, diassociated, or polyassociated with the following strains of intestinal bacteria: escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium infantis, clostridium indolis, c. paraputrificum, c. perfringens, c. innocuum, c. nexile, c. ramosum, c. clostridiiforme, bacteroides multiacidus, bacteroides fragilis, veillonella alcalescens, v. parvula, and lactobacillus acidophilus. the incidence of liver tumors was higher in most of the gnotobiotes (67--100%) and conventionalized mice (82%) derived from the germfree mice than in the germfree mice (39%). the average incidence of tumor nodules in gnotobiotes associated with e. coli, s. faecalis, and c. paraputrificum was 2.9, which was significantly higher than that in the conventionalized animals (1.6). in contrast, the average incidence of tumor nodules in gnotobiotes associated with e. coli, s. faecalis, l. acidophilus, c. perfringens, and bacteroides fragilis (0.9) was not significantly different from  that in germfree animals (0.5). the present study demonstrated that the presence  of certain intestinal bacteria is related to liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice.
