TI  == the microbial epidemiology of breast implant infections in a regional referral centre for plastic and reconstructive surgery in the south of france.
AB  == background: breast implant infections are usually caused by staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. gram-negative bacilli are rarely reported to be involved in breast implant infections. methods: thirty-seven cases of microbiologically confirmed breast implant infection managed from january 2008 to june 2012 in the study centre were reviewed, including 10 cases from the study centre itself and 27 cases from private clinics in the region. results: the prevalence of breast implant infection in the study centre was 0.74% of breast implantation, i.e., 3.23% in breast reconstruction for breast cancer and 0.27% in aesthetic breast augmentation (p=0.0002). of the 37 cases, 30% had undergone radiotherapy and 11% had undergone a lymph node dissection. s. aureus was identified in 18 cases, gram-negative bacilli in 10 cases, coagulase-negative staphylococci in eight cases, anaerobic bacteria in eight cases, and streptococci in three cases. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the second most commonly identified pathogen. staphylococcus epidermidis was the most frequent coagulase-negative staphylococcus species. in addition to propionibacterium acnes and actinomyces neuii, other facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria have not been reported before, e.g., bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, corynebacterium simulans, dermabacter hominis, finegoldia magna, and peptoniphilus harei. seventy-percent of cases were treated by immediate implant removal. all cases treated only with antibiotics were treated with surgery at the second visit. conclusions: the microbiological epidemiology was noted by an increasing the proportion of gram-negative bacteria  and anaerobic bacteria detected with the advent of maldi-tof ms and molecular identification for diagnosis.

TI  == green synthesis of copper nanoparticles by citrus medica linn. (idilimbu) juice and its antimicrobial activity.
AB  == we report an eco-friendly method for the synthesis of copper nanoparticles (cunps) using citron juice (citrus medica linn.), which is nontoxic and cheap. the biogenic copper nanoparticles were characterized by uv-vis spectrophotometer  showing a typical resonance (spr) at about 631 nm which is specific for cunps. nanoparticles tracking analysis by nanosight-lm20 showed the particles in the range of 10-60 nm with the concentration of 2.18 x 10(8) particles per ml. x-ray  diffraction revealed the fcc nature of nanoparticles with an average size of 20 nm. the antimicrobial activity of cunps was determined by kirby-bauer disk diffusion method against some selected species of bacteria and plant pathogenic fungi. it was reported that the synthesized cunps demonstrated a significant inhibitory activity against escherichia coli followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, propionibacterium acnes and salmonella typhi. among the plant pathogenic fungi tested, fusarium culmorum was found to be most sensitive followed by f. oxysporum and f. graminearum. the novelty of this work is that for the first time citron juice was used for the synthesis of cunps.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and mechanism of action of a novel cationic alpha-helical  octadecapeptide derived from alpha-amylase of rice.
AB  == amyi-1-18, an octadecapeptide derived from alpha-amylase (amyi-1) of rice (oryza  sativa l. japonica), is a novel cationic alpha-helical antimicrobial peptide (amp) that contains two lysine and two arginine residues. the antimicrobial activity of amyi-1-18 against human pathogens was quantitatively evaluated using  a chemiluminescence method that measures atp derived from viable cells. of the ten kinds of human pathogens, amyi-1-18 exhibited antimicrobial activity against  nine. its 50% growth-inhibitory concentrations (ics50 ) against porphyromonas gingivalis, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, and streptococcus mutans were 13, 19, 50, 64, and 77 mum, respectively. amyi-1-18 had little or no hemolytic activity even at 500 mum, and showed negligible cytotoxicity up to 1200 mum. the degree of 3,3'-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide release from p. gingivalis cells induced by the addition of amyi-1-18 was significantly lower than that induced by the addition of melittin. flow cytometric analysis showed that the percentages of p. aeruginosa, s. mutans, and  c. albicans cells stained with propidium iodide (pi), a dna-intercalating dye, were 89%, 43%, and 3%, respectively, when amyi-1-18 was added at a concentration  equal to its 4xic50 . therefore, the antimicrobial activity of amyi-1-18 against  p. aeruginosa and s. mutans appears to be mainly attributable to its membrane-disrupting activity. in contrast, its antimicrobial activity against p.  gingivalis and c. albicans most likely depends upon interactions with intracellular targets other than their cell membranes. collectively, these results indicate that amyi-1-18 is useful as a safe and potent amp against the pathogens described above in many fields of healthcare.

TI  == infection of cardiovascular implantable electronic devices: detection with sonication, swab cultures, and blood cultures.
AB  == background: the number of patients with cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (cieds) is increasing. the purpose of this study was to compare three methods (sonication, swab cultures, and blood cultures) to detect bacteria in infections of cieds. methods: patients with pocket infection of cieds and/or cied-associated infective endocarditis were prospectively included. generators and leads were sonicated together. swab cultures of the generator pocket and blood cultures were performed. results: between january 2009 and september 2012,  18 patients with a cied infection were recorded, including two definite and four  possible cied-ies. in 17 patients, blood cultures were performed and the device was analyzed by sonication. a swab culture from the device pocket was performed in 16 cases. ten (59%) patients received antibiotic therapy before the device was removed. in 15 of 16 cases (94%), bacteria were detected by sonication, while bacteria were detected in only nine (56%) and seven (41%) cases by swab-and blood cultures, respectively. in four cases (24%), sonication was the only method that  detected bacteria. the following bacteria were detected by sonication: methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa; n = 6), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns; n = 3), propionibacterium acnes (n = 2), staphylococcus lugdunensis (n = 1), mssa/pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1),bacillus cereus (n = 1), mssa/p. acnes (n = 1), andp. acnes/cns (n = 1). all positive swab cultures and all positive blood cultures but one grew the same bacteria as sonication fluid cultures. conclusion: sonication can be more sensitive than swab cultures or blood cultures in detecting bacteria in infections of cieds.

TI  == [advances in the research on bactericidal effect of blue light and its mechanism].
AB  == blue light is commonly used to kill propionibacterium acnes in clinic. furthermore, blue light exhibits a good bactericidal effect against helicobacter  pylori, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and  many oral bacteria in laboratory studies. the bactericidal mechanism of blue light as commonly accepted consists photo-excitation of intracellular porphyrins  resulting in production of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species which can inactivate bacteria. blue light can kill bacteria without additional exogenous photosensitizers. in addition, it produces little harm to mammalian cells. therefore, as the increasing emergence of antibiotic resistant microorganisms, blue light might be a good antibacterial tool.

TI  == enzymatic treatment of specimens before dna extraction directly influences molecular detection of infectious agents.
AB  == introduction: biological samples, pharmaceuticals or food contain proteins, lipids, polymers, ammoniums and macromolecules that alter the detection of infectious agents by dna amplification techniques (pcr). moreover the targeted dna has to be released from the complex cell walls and the compact nucleoprotein  matrixes and cleared from potential inhibitors. the goal of the present work was  to assess the efficiency of enzymatic pretreatments on infectious agents to make  dna available for further extraction and amplification. methods: staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, aspergillus niger and fusarium solani were mixed with an internal control virus and treated with: 1) proteinase k; 2) lyticase and 3) lyticase followed by proteinase k. dnas was manually extracted using the qiamp dna mini kit or the magna pure compact automate. dna extraction yields and the inhibitors were assessed with a phocid herpesvirus. bacterial detection was performed using taqman real-time pcr and yeasts and filamentous fungi with hrm (real-time pcr followed by high-resolution melting analysis). results: viral dna was released, extracted and detected using manual and automatic methods without pre enzymatic treatments. either the manual or the automatic dna extraction systems did not meet the sensitivity expectations if enzymatic treatments were not performed before: lyticase for fungi and proteinase k for bacteria. the addition of lyticase and proteinase k did not improve results. for fungi the detection after lyticase was higher than for proteinase k, for which melting analysis did not allow fungal specification. discussion: columns and magnetic beads allowed collecting dna and separate pcr inhibitors. detection rates cannot be related to dna-avidity of beads or to elution but to the lack of proteolysis.

TI  == an exploratory study of microbial diversity in sinus infections of cystic fibrosis patients by molecular methods.
AB  == background: for the first time microorganisms in cf sinuses are investigated by molecular methods in response to an absence of anaerobes in cf sinus samples during a two-year period at the copenhagen cf center. methods: endoscopic sinus surgery was performed in 19 cf patients. dna from intact bacterial cells was investigated by 16s rrna gene analysis and quantitative pcr. results were compared to culture-dependent routine diagnosis. results: molecular methods showed a large microbial diversity, which included undetected anaerobes that may  play a pathogenic role. importantly, the culture methods did not always detect known cf pathogens. quantitative pcr showed generally a higher abundance of classic cf pathogens e.g. pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus compared with the anaerobe propionibacterium acnes. conclusions: the results indicate that the culture methods in some cases may not be suitable as stand-alone method for this patient group, as diversity may be underestimated and important species undetected.

TI  == influence of different additives and their concentrations on corneal toxicity and antimicrobial effect of benzalkonium chloride.
AB  == purpose: the aim of this study was to examine the ophthalmic additives responsible for modulating acute corneal epithelial toxicity induced by benzalkonium chloride (bac) and investigate the ability of polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil 40 (hco-40) and polysorbate 80 (ps-80) to reduce the corneal toxicity and antimicrobial effects of bac. methods: cytotoxicity of the additives, which included glycerin, polyvinyl alcohol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and ps-80, on rabbit corneal epithelial cells was examined using the cell proliferation assay in the presence and absence of 0.02% bac. the  corneal transepithelial electrical resistance change after a 60-second exposure to hco-40 or ps-80 mixed with 0.02% bac was measured in living rabbits. corneal damage was examined using scanning electron microscopy. the antimicrobial activities of hco-40 and ps-80 with 0.02% bac against staphylococcus aureus, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and streptococcus pneumoniae were assessed. results: of all the tested additives, only ps-80 could prevent the bac-induced cytotoxicity. corneal epithelial barrier function disorder caused by 0.02% bac was significantly alleviated by either ps-80 or hco-40 in a concentration-dependent manner. scanning electron microscopy images showed an improvement of bac-induced corneal epithelial toxicity after the addition of hco-40 or ps-80. the antimicrobial effect of the bac against p. aeruginosa, e. coli, and s. pneumoniae was reduced after adding hco-40 or ps-80.  conclusions: hco-40 and ps-80 reduce acute corneal toxicity and the antimicrobial effect of bac. possible interactions between bac and other additives should be taken into consideration when evaluating the toxicity and antibacterial properties of bac.

TI  == bacterial epidemiology of osteoarticular infections in a referent center: 10-year study.
AB  == introduction: management of osteoarticular infections combines surgical treatment with antibiotic therapy. for some teams the immediate postoperative regimen requires at least partly wide-spectrum probabilistic treatment while waiting for  the microbiological results. this protocol exposes the patient to the selection of resistant bacteria and the hospital unit to a modification of its bacterial ecology. the objective of this study was to retrospectively describe the microbial epidemiology of the traumatology and orthopaedics department of the lille university hospital over 10 years (2002-2011). materials and methods: the bacterial species isolated in culture of osteoarticular samples were listed, after removing any duplicates. the antibiotics retained for follow-up were those  used in treatment of these infections as well as those recognized as markers of resistance. for gram-positive species, the antibiotics considered were methicillin, rifampicin, fluoroquinolones, glycopeptides, and linezolid; for the  gram-negative species, cefotaxime, cefepime, imipenem, and fluoroquinolones were  considered. results: of the 5006 strains isolated between 2002 and 2011, gram-positive cocci accounted for more than 71%; staphylococcus aureus 27%, and coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) 54%. contrary to s. aureus, resistance to methicillin, fluoroquinolones, and teicoplanin significantly increased in cons, reaching 44%, 34%, and 22%, respectively, of the strains in 2011. the proportion  of streptococcal and enterococcal infections remained stable, a mean 7.4% and 5.3%, respectively, per year. enterobacteria (12.5% of the isolates) were producers of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase in 7.8% of the cases. pseudomonas aeruginosa was involved in 3.6% of the infections, and 12% of the strains remained resistant to ceftazidime. propionibacterium acnes accounted for 5.8% of  the bacteria isolated and showed few antibiotic resistance problems. discussion:  stability in the distribution and the susceptibility of different bacterial species was noted over this 10-year period. although the evolution of s. aureus resistance was favourable, the resistance of cons specially to methicillin and glycopeptides increased. level of evidence: level iv. retrospective cohort study.

TI  == endophthalmitis isolates and antibiotic susceptibilities: a 10-year review of culture-proven cases.
AB  == purpose: to investigate the spectrum of organisms causing culture-proven endophthalmitis and their susceptibilities to commonly used antimicrobial agents  over 10 years. design: retrospective, noncomparative, consecutive case series. methods: medical records were reviewed of all cases with culture-proven endophthalmitis at a single institution from 2002 through 2011. the outcome measures included all intravitreal isolates identified as well as antibiotic susceptibilities. results: a total of 448 organisms were isolated during the study interval. the most common organisms identified were staphylococcus epidermidis in 30.1% (135/448), streptococcus viridians group in 10.9% (49/448),  staphylococcus aureus in 7.8% (35/448), candida albicans in 5.8% (26/443), other  coagulase-negative staphylococci in 6.0% (27/448), propionibacterium acnes in 4.7% (21/448), and pseudomonas aeruginosa in 3.1% (14/448). overall, 327 (72.9%)  of 448 isolates were gram-positive organisms, 48 (10.7%) of 448 isolates were gram-negative organisms, 71 (15.8%) of 448 isolates were fungi, and 2 (0.4%) of 448 isolates were viruses. for gram-positive organisms, susceptibilities were the following: vancomycin, 100%; gentamicin, 88.0%; sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, 77.5%; levofloxacin, 58.5%; oxacillin, 54.7%; ciprofloxacin, 51.0%; gatifloxacin, 51.0%; and moxifloxacin, 47.0%. for gram-negative organisms, susceptibilities were the following: ceftazidime, 100%; levofloxacin, 100%; ciprofloxacin, 95.0%;  tobramycin, 90.6%; gentamicin, 80.6%; and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, 59.4%. conclusions: in the current study, no single antibiotic provided coverage for all of the microbes isolated from eyes with endophthalmitis. combination therapy generally is the recommendation as the initial empiric treatment of suspected bacterial endophthalmitis. appropriate history and characteristic clinical features may guide the use of initial antifungal agents.

TI  == percutaneous absorption and antibacterial activities of lipid nanocarriers loaded with dual drugs for acne treatment.
AB  == the aim of this study was to develop lipid nanocarriers that combine tretinoin and tetracycline for the efficient topical delivery to treat acne vulgaris. two different nanocarriers, nanoemulsions (nes) and nanostructured lipid carriers (nlcs), were prepared, and we examined their average size, zeta potential, drug encapsulation percentage, and drug permeation via the skin. the antibacterial activities of the nanosystems against staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and propionibacterium acnes were evaluated by an agar diffusion assay and the amount of total protein. a ca. 200-nm particle size was achieved with the prepared nanoparticles. the size increased when incorporating a cationic surfactant. dual-drug loading did not largely affect the size of negatively charged nanoparticles, but significantly reduced the particle size of positively  charged nanocarriers. nes and nlcs exhibited high entrapment of tretinoin which ranged 60-100%. tetracycline mainly resided in the aqueous phase, with ca. 10% of molecules located at the particulate interface. an in vitro skin permeation study showed that nlcs enhanced tetracycline flux by about 2-times over the control solution. tretinoin permeation was generally unaffected after nanoparticulate encapsulation. there was no significant difference in tretinoin delivery before or after tetracycline incorporation, while tetracycline permeation significantly  decreased by 2-fold in the dual-drug system. nanoparticulate loading mostly maintained the antibacterial activity of tetracycline. negatively charged nes and nlcs even strengthened the antibacterial ability against s. aureus compared to the control solution. this is the first report examining skin permeation and antibacterial activities of dual-drug nanocarriers for acne treatment.

TI  == suppuration-associated bacteria in patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: suppuration (sup) on probing may be an indication of active periodontal breakdown. the aim of the present study is to analyze which subgingival species are associated with sup in patients with chronic (cp) and aggressive (agp) periodontitis. methods: a total of 156 patients with cp and 66 with agp were submitted to full-mouth periodontal examination and subgingival biofilm sampling (14 sites/patient). the counts of 44 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard. comparisons between groups and sites were analyzed by the mann-whitney and wilcoxon tests, respectively. associations between frequency of sup and bacterial species were analyzed by the spearman correlation coefficient. results: the prevalence of sup in patients with cp was 24.4%, and in patients with agp it was 30.3%, and the percentage of sup sites in the groups was 5.72% +/- 1.06% and 6.96% +/- 1.70%, respectively (p >0.05). sup sites from patients with cp had significantly higher counts of veillonella parvula, dialister pneumosintes, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella nigrescens than sup  sites from patients with agp (p <0.005). significant positive correlations between high frequency of sup and high levels of actinomyces spp, streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were observed in patients with cp (p <0.05). in patients with agp, actinomyces oris, propionibacterium acnes, p. aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  and streptococcus sanguinis were positively associated with sup, whereas prevotella intermedia presented a negative association with sup (p <0.05). conclusions: sup sites from patients with cp harbored significantly higher counts of several periodontal species than sup sites from patients with agp. actinomyces spp., streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, t. forsythia, and certain non-oral pathogens were associated with a high number of sites with sup.

TI  == blue light for infectious diseases: propionibacterium acnes, helicobacter pylori, and beyond?
AB  == blue light, particularly in the wavelength range of 405-470 nm, has attracted increasing attention due to its intrinsic antimicrobial effect without the addition of exogenous photosensitizers. in addition, it is commonly accepted that blue light is much less detrimental to mammalian cells than ultraviolet irradiation, which is another light-based antimicrobial approach being investigated. in this review, we discussed the blue light sensing systems in microbial cells, antimicrobial efficacy of blue light, the mechanism of antimicrobial effect of blue light, the effects of blue light on mammalian cells, and the effects of blue light on wound healing. it has been reported that blue light can regulate multi-cellular behavior involving cell-to-cell communication via blue light receptors in bacteria, and inhibit biofilm formation and subsequently potentiate light inactivation. at higher radiant exposures, blue light exhibits a broad-spectrum antimicrobial effect against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. blue light therapy is a clinically accepted approach  for propionibacterium acnes infections. clinical trials have also been conducted  to investigate the use of blue light for helicobacter pylori stomach infections and have shown promising results. studies on blue light inactivation of important wound pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa have also been reported. the mechanism of blue light inactivation of p. acnes, h. pylori, and some oral bacteria is proved to be the photo-excitation  of intracellular porphyrins and the subsequent production of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species. although it may be the case that the mechanism of blue light inactivation of wound pathogens (e.g., s. aureus, p. aeruginosa) is the same as that of p. acnes, this hypothesis has not been rigorously tested. limited and discordant results have been reported regarding the effects of blue light on mammalian cells and wound healing. under certain wavelengths and radiant exposures, blue light may cause cell dysfunction by the photo-excitation of blue  light sensitizing chromophores, including flavins and cytochromes, within mitochondria or/and peroxisomes. further studies should be performed to optimize  the optical parameters (e.g., wavelength, radiant exposure) to ensure effective and safe blue light therapies for infectious disease. in addition, studies are also needed to verify the lack of development of microbial resistance to blue light.

TI  == syk/src pathway-targeted inhibition of skin inflammatory responses by carnosic acid.
AB  == carnosic acid (ca) is a diterpene compound exhibiting antioxidative, anticancer,  anti-angiogenic, anti-inflammatory, anti-metabolic disorder, and hepatoprotective and neuroprotective activities. in this study, the effect of ca on various skin inflammatory responses and its inhibitory mechanism were examined. ca strongly suppressed the production of il-6, il-8, and mcp-1 from keratinocyte hacat cells  stimulated with sodium lauryl sulfate (sls) and retinoic acid (ra). in addition,  ca blocked the release of nitric oxide (no), tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, and prostaglandin e(2) (pge(2)) from raw264.7 cells activated by the toll-like receptor (tlr)-2 ligands, gram-positive bacterium-derived peptidoglycan (pgn) and pam3csk, and the tlr4 ligand, gram-negative bacterium-derived lipopolysaccharide  (lps). ca arrested the growth of dermatitis-inducing gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms such propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus. ca also blocked the nuclear translocation  of nuclear factor (nf)-kappab and its upstream signaling including syk/src, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (pi3k), akt, inhibitor of kappabalpha (ikappabalpha) kinase (ikk), and ikappabalpha for nf-kappab activation. kinase assays revealed that syk could be direct enzymatic target of ca in its anti-inflammatory action.  therefore, our data strongly suggest the potential of ca as an anti-inflammatory  drug against skin inflammatory responses with src/nf-kappab inhibitory properties.

TI  == antibacterial properties of a glycolipid-rich extract and active principle from nunavik collections of the macroalgae fucus evanescens c. agardh (fucaceae).
AB  == this study investigated the antibacterial activity of glycolipid-rich extracts of the brown macroalga fucus evanescens in cell culture. accessions were collected on the arctic coast of ungava bay, nunavik, quebec. the crude ethyl acetate extract of these accessions showed strong antibacterial activity (>/=4 log(10) cfu) against hemophilus influenzae , legionella pneumophila , propionibacterium acnes (atcc and clinical isolate), and streptococcus pyogenes at 100 microg/ml. this algal extract inhibited by 3 log(10) clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus , whereas bacillus cereus , escherichia coli , klebsiella pneumoniae , and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not significantly affected. further investigations of the activity of a glycolipid-rich fraction, extracted with dichloromethane, against propionibacterium acnes showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml, with an inhibition of more than 99% at only 7.8 microg/ml. the main active compound, a beta-d-galactosyl o-linked glycolipid, was synthesized for the bioassay and showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml but lost its activity more quickly with only 50% of inhibition at 12.5 microg/ml. therefore, the semipurified f. evanescens extract could be a good choice for future research into the development of alternative treatments for acne therapy.

TI  == evaluation of the scanrdi(r) as a rapid alternative to the pharmacopoeial sterility test method: comparison of the limits of detection.
AB  == two sterility test methods, the scanrdi(r) rapid sterility test and the united states pharmacopeia/european pharmacopoeia/japanese pharmacopoeia (usp/ep/jp) compendial sterility test, were compared with respect to the limits of detection  for the presence of viable microorganisms in aqueous solutions at low inoculation levels. the scanrdi(r) system employs a combination of direct fluorescent labeling techniques and solid-phase laser scanning cytometry to rapidly enumerate viable microorganisms from aqueous samples, whereas the compendial sterility test is a qualitative, growth-based method that uses a visual assessment of turbidity  to indicate microbial contamination. eight microorganisms were evaluated, seven compendial microorganisms (clostridium sporogenes, escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, aspergillus niger, candida  albicans) and the gram-positive anaerobe propionibacterium acnes. the number of viable organisms was estimated using the scanrdi(r) method and the conventional sterility test method using most probable number methodology. the mean difference between the methods was computed and 95% confidence intervals around the mean difference were estimated. the scanrdi(r) method was found to be numerically superior and statistically non-inferior to the compendial (usp/ep/jp) sterility test with respect to the limits of detection for all organisms tested.

TI  == interactions between various microbes and ginseng botanicals.
AB  == three kinds of interactions occur between ginseng botanicals and microorganisms:  a) spoilage of the botanical by various fungi (e.g., aspergillus, penicillium, alternaria, and eurotium species) and bacteria; b) transformation of ginsenosides into more bioactive forms by bacteria such as intrasporangium sp. gs603, microbacterium sp. gs514, caulobacter leidyia, bifidobacterium sp. int57, bifidobacterium sp. sj32, fusobacterium sp. and bacteroides sp., and moulds (e.g., aspergillus niger, fusarium sacchari, paecilomyces bainier sp. 229, rhizopus stolonifer, myrothecium verrucaria and acremonium strictum); and c) inhibition of certain bacteria (propionibacterium acnes, porphyromonas gingivalis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa), fungi (candida albicans, aspergillus fumigatus, fusarium oxysporum) and viruses by ginseng constituents.

AB  == we tested the activity of epinecidin-1, a novel antimicrobial peptide structurally related to pleurocidin, in commercial cleaning solutions stored at 4 and 25 degrees c for 7 and 14 days. the peptide's activities against enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, propionibacterium acnes, and candida albicans were measured in a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) determination, minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) determination, disk diffusion test, and a count  of the bacterial numbers. exposure to epinecidn-1 in a cleaning solution following mic value comparisons in the disk diffusion test and counts of bacterial numbers after 16, 24, 48, and 72 h suggested that bacterial numbers were much lower than those treated with only commercial cleaning solutions for all bacteria. the efficacy of the antimicrobial activities of inhibiting bacterial numbers by epinecidin-1 in cleaning solutions at a low ph and a low temperature was not affected. given its simple structure and antimicrobial activity, epinecidin-1 may be a useful component of microbicides designed to prevent pathogen infections and/or remediate abnormal vaginal or skin flora.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of iodoquinol 1%-hydrocortisone acetate 2% gel against ciclopirox and clotrimazole.
AB  == commercially available topical formulations consisting of iodoquinol 1%-hydrocortisone acetate 2%, ciclopirox 0.77%, and clotrimazole 1%-betamethasone dipropionate 0.5% were assessed for their antimicrobial activity against cultures of micrococcus luteus, propionibacterium acnes, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa, corynebacterium aquaticum,  trichophyton mentagrophytes, malassezia furfur, microsporum canis, candida albicans, trichophyton rubrum, or epidermophyton floccosum. at 1 and 5 minutes following inoculation into suspensions of each product, aliquots were removed, serially diluted, and plated onto appropriate agar to determine the log reduction in colony-forming units (cfus) for each organism. iodoquinol 1% produced the broadest and greatest antimicrobial activity as measured by a 3-log reduction of  cfu, active against all microbes tested following incubation times of 1 or 5 minutes, except m luteus. by contrast, ciclopirox 0.77% and clotrimazole 1% showed activity against p aeruginosa and t rubrum, with ciclopirox also killing m luteus, p acnes, m canis, c albicans, and e floccosum at 5 minutes. iodoquinol 1%-hydrocortisone acetate 2% also was the only product that showed effective antibacterial reduction of mrsa at 1 minute.

TI  == comparison of multiple methods for quantification of microbial biofilms grown in  microtiter plates.
AB  == in the present study six assays for the quantification of biofilms formed in 96-well microtiter plates were optimised and evaluated: the crystal violet (cv) assay, the syto9 assay, the fluorescein diacetate (fda) assay, the resazurin assay, the xtt assay and the dimethyl methylene blue (dmmb) assay. pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cenocepacia, staphylococcus aureus, propionibacterium acnes and candida albicans were used as test organisms. in general, these assays  showed a broad applicability and a high repeatability for most isolates. in addition, the estimated numbers of cfus present in the biofilms show limited variations between the different assays. nevertheless, our data show that some assays are less suitable for the quantification of biofilms of particular isolates (e.g. the cv assay for p. aeruginosa).

TI  == breast abscess bacteriologic features in the era of community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus epidemics.
AB  == hypothesis: increasing rates of community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) infections have also affected the microbial profile  of breast abscesses. objective: to update the decade-old bacteriologic description of breast abscesses to improve the choice of initial antibacterial drug therapy. design: retrospective case series. setting: county hospital emergency department. patients: forty-four women (mean age, 41 years; age range,  20-63 years) with breast abscesses. methods: all cultures from the breast abscesses of patients were reviewed. main outcome measures: the microbiologic features and sensitivities of breast abscesses. results: of 46 specimens only 28  showed bacterial yield (61%). of these, 11 (39%) were polymicrobial, for an average of 1.4 isolates per specimen. the most common organism was s aureus, present in 12 of 37 aerobic cultures (32%), with mrsa in 7 (58%). the remaining organisms included coagulase-negative staphylococcus (16%), diphtheroids (16%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), proteus mirabilis (5%), and other isolates (22%). all mrsa was sensitive to clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and linezolid. only 2 patients (29%) were sensitive to levofloxacin. two anaerobic cultures were positive for propionibacterium acnes and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. conclusions: staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogenic organism in modern breast abscesses. many breast abscesses have community-acquired mrsa, with more than 50% of all s aureus and 19% of all cultures being mrsa. this finding parallels the local and national increases in mrsa reported in other soft-tissue infections. with increasing bacterial resistance and more minimally invasive management of breast abscesses, understanding the current bacteriologic profile of these abscesses is essential to determining the correct empirical antibiotic drug therapy.

TI  == [preoperatively administered flomoxef sodium concentration in aqueous humor].
AB  == purpose: we intravenously administered flomoxef sodium (fmox) 0.5-3.5 hours before cataract surgery and measured the concentration of the agent in the aqueous humor to investigate its penetration into the aqueous humor and its efficacy in the prevention of postoperative endophthalmitis. methods: 56 patients who underwent cataract surgery were enrolled in this study. they received 1 g fmox via a 20-minute intravenous drip beginning 0.5-3.5 hours before the operation. aqueous humor was aspirated from the anterior chamber and assayed for  fmox concentration using high-performance liquid chromatography. results: the mean intraoperative fmox concentrations in the patients' aqueous humor were 0.79  +/- 0.24 microg/ml (administered 3.5 hours before surgery)--1.47 0.79 microg/ml (administered 1.5 hours before surgery). these concentrations administered 0.5-3.0 hours before surgery sufficiently exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) 90 values against staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus  aureus and propionibacterium acnes, but did not achieve the mic90 values against  enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. conclusions: the fmox concentrations in the aqueous humor sampling were adequate to kill bacteria in vitro. this drug may be efficacious in the prevention of postoperative endophthalmitis in patients undergoing cataract surgery.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal effects of 405-nm and 470-nm blue light.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to determine the bactericidal effect of 405- and 470-nm light on two bacteria, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa, in vitro. background data: it is well-known that uv light kills bacteria, but the bactericidal effects of uv may not be unique since recent studies indicate that blue light produces a somewhat similar effect. the effects  of blue light seem varied depending on wavelength, dose and the nature of the bacteria, hence this study. methods: two common aerobes, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anaerobic propionibacterium acnes were tested. each organism was treated with super luminous diode probes with peak emission at  405 and 470 nm. treatment was timed to yield 1, 3, 5, 10, and 15 jcm2 doses. colony counts were performed and compared to untreated controls. results: the 405-nm light produced a dose dependent bactericidal effect on pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus (p < .05), achieving as much as 95.1% and nearly 90% kill rate for each, respectively. the 470-nm light effectively killed  pseudomonas aeruginosa at all dose levels, but only killed staphylococcus aureus  at 10 and 15 j cm2. with this wavelength, as much as 96.5% and 62% reduction of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus was achieved, respectively. neither of the two wavelengths proved bactericidal with anaerobic propionibacterium acnes. conclusion: the results indicate that, in vitro, 405- and 470-nm blue light produce dose dependent bactericidal effects on pseudomonas  aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus but not propionibacterium acnes.

TI  == an in vitro study of antimicrobial activity and efficacy of iodine-generating hydrogel dressings.
AB  == objective: to determine the antimicrobial activity and efficacy of different formulations of novel bioxygenating hydrogel dressings (which deliver both iodine and oxygen into the wound) against various target organisms by means of an in vitro test system that more effectively mimics the conditions encountered when dressings are in contact with wounds. method: three bioxygenating hydrogels were  tested: oxyzyme, which releases low levels of iodine into the wound, and iodozyme 402 and iodozyme 401, which release higher levels of iodine, with iodozyme 402 releasing twice the amount of 401. cellulose filter disks (n = 32) were inoculated with indicator species and placed equidistant from each other as a matrix onto agar test beds. cut squares of control or test dressings were placed  on top of each disk. kill curves were constructed from determinations of the numbers of survivors (log cfu per disk) over time by removing disk samples at various time points. results: significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed between the controls and test samples. the order of sensitivity for oxyzyme was fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), candida albicans and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the order of efficacy of the three hydrogel dressings (iodozyme 402, followed by iodozyme 401 and then oxyzyme) was  the same regardless of the target species. conclusion: the novel hydrogel skin surface wound dressings are broad-spectrum in activity, encompassing antibiotic-resistant organisms, anaerobes and yeasts; their antimicrobial function appears to be rapidly effective.

TI  == elimination and multiplication of bacteria during preparation and storage of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: the prevalence of bacterial contamination of random-donor platelet concentrates (pcs) is considerably lower than that of blood donations. which key  steps of the preparation procedure contribute to the elimination of bacteria was  investigated. study design and methods: ten bacteria species were used. blood donations were spiked with bacteria and stored at 22 degrees c for 8 hours. the buffy coats were kept for 6 hours. pcs were prepared from pools of 4 buffy coats. at each preparation step and during pc storage, bacteria contents were measured.  in additional experiments, the titers of spiked blood and buffy coats were determined after storage at 20, 22, or 24 degrees c for 8 and up to 24 hours, respectively. results: enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica were completely inactivated during storage in blood or buffy coats. titer reduction was between 3.32 and 4.62 log. bacillus cereus, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis did not multiply. compared with their values in spiked blood the titers in the pcs were reduced by 1.7 to 2.8 log. klebsiella pneumoniae was the only species that grew in blood. with the exception of p. acnes, those species that were not removed by the preparation process multiplied in the pcs. remarkable donor-to-donor variations of the bactericidal activities of buffy coats were detected when the storage time was prolonged to 24 hours. conclusions: bacteria are significantly eliminated by the preparation procedure for random donor pcs. also, blood and buffy coats are bactericidal for  most species. when buffy-coat storage is prolonged, it cannot, however, be predicted whether specific strains vanish or multiply.

TI  == basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: flow cytometry (facs) is a common technique in blood banking. it is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. it was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (pcs).  study design and methods: plasma-reduced pcs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees c for various times. the following 10 species were used: bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica. bacterial dna was stained with thiazole orange. after the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by facs. results: all bacteria species used were detectable by facs. the lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microl, that is, 10(5) per ml. in general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. in one  case (k. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with  that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. when pc samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per ml of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees c, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. exceptions were e. cloacae and p. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. at 20 to 24 degrees c, the detection times were strongly prolonged. conclusion: sterility testing of pcs by facs is a feasible approach. the present  data suggest incubating pc samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees c before testing. for slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1  to 2 days.

TI  == optimal sampling time after preparation of platelet concentrates for detection of bacterial contamination by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background and objectives: a universal quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr), based on bacterial 16s rdna, to detect bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates (pcs), was developed previously and compared with automated culturing. in the present study, this real-time pcr method was evaluated to determine the optimal sampling time for screening of bacterial contamination in pcs. materials and methods: routinely prepared pcs were spiked with suspensions of escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and propionibacterium acnes to 1, 10 and 100 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml and stored at room temperature for 7 days. the presence of bacteria in these pcs was monitored by quantitative real-time pcr. as a reference method (additional control), bact/alert automated culturing was used. for pcr, 1-ml aliquots were drawn from all (spiked) pcs on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 of storage. as a control, triplicate samples (10 ml) were inoculated into aerobic and anaerobic bact/alert culture bottles immediately after spiking (day 0) and after  storage for 1, 2, 3, 6 or 7 days. results: with quantitative real-time pcr, all bacterial species tested were reproducibly detected on day 1 after spiking at original concentrations of 10 and 100 cfu/ml. bacteria were also detected on day  1 from pcs spiked with an initial concentration of 1 cfu/ml, except for e. coli,  which was detected in only one of the three samples and p. aeruginosa, for which  analysis was not performed on day 1. with the reference method, bacteria were detected in culture bottles (inoculated on day 0) within a mean time of 20.1 h, with the exception of p. acnes which was detected at a mean time of 102.3 and 49.3 h (for original spiking concentrations of 10 and 100 cfu/ml respectively). conclusions: pcr enables the rapid detection of low initial numbers of bacteria in pcs. for reliable detection, our results support that sampling of pcs for real-time pcr screening should not be carried out earlier than 1 day after preparation (48 h after blood collection). importantly, the real-time pcr approach has the potential to be used before the release of pcs from the blood centre or shortly before they are transfused in the hospital.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == palmitoleic acid isomer (c16:1delta6) in human skin sebum is effective against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the percent lipid composition of pooled human sebum analyzed by thin-layer chromatography was: ceramides (13%), fatty acid (47%), cholesterol (7%), cholesterol esters (2%), squalene (11%), triglycerides (3%), and wax esters (17%). total sebum lipids (2- 4 mg/ml), sonicated into bacterial culture medium,  caused 4- to 5-fold log reduction in growth of gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus salivarius and the anaerobe fusobacterium nucleatum, but was ineffective against most gram-negative bacteria. fractionation of the sebum lipids showed that both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids contained the bulk of the antimicrobial activity. lauric acid (c12:0) was the most active saturated fatty acid. the unsaturated fatty acid, palmitoleic acid (c16:1delta6, cpa) was both the most predominant monoene and the most active antimicrobial fatty acid. purified cpa (>99%) yielded typical minimal inhibitory  concentration (mic) values of 10-20 microg/ml against gram-positive bacteria. organically synthesized cpa isomer gave mic values comparable to the natural material. both natural and synthetic cpa were found to be the most active sebum lipid fraction in blocking the adherence of a pathogenic strain of candida albicans to porcine stratum corneum. ethanol in combination with cpa exerts a synergistic bactericidal activity against gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, propionibacterium acnes, escherichia coli, and  several methacillin-resistant strains of s. aureus. palmitoleic acid may be useful in topical formulations for treatment of secondary gram-positive bacterial infections, as a gram-positive bacteria antimicrobial in wound dressings, and as  a natural gram-positive antimicrobial preservative in skin and hair care products.

AB  == aims: to test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. methods: the bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 iu/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin b was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees c with five inocula of 14 bacteria. two yeasts  (candida spp) and one aspergillus were also tested. contaminated media were then  inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened  daily by visual inspection. the sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. results: organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria  irrespective of the starting inoculums: streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, and haemophilus influenzae. for micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal  only (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, candida kruzei, aspergillus  fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (sd 13.8, range 2-52). in cases of detection by the  blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. conclusions: blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  == background: retinoids such as retinoic acid (ra), retinol (rol) and retinaldehyde (ral) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. aim: to analyse the potential anti-infective  activities of topical rol, ral and ra. methods: microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of rol, ral and ra were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus flavus, propionibacterium acnes, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus hominis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant s. aureus, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, streptococcus group b, enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and pseudomonas/klebsiella. in two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% ral or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% ral or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. results: of the three retinoids tested, only ral showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like s. aeureus, micrococcus spp. or  p. acnes. no activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. these results on  reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. mic(50) and mic(90) values for ral were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant s. aureus. the two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with ral had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. in the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2)  for p. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. no resistant bacteria were  found after 2 weeks of topical use. preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of ral is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. conclusion: we have shown that ral differs from parent natural retinoids such as rol and ra in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. this activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the  potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.

AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

TI  == correlation between microbiology and previous sinus surgery in patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis.
AB  == aspirates of 108 chronically inflamed maxillary sinuses were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. there were 295 bacterial isolates: 109 aerobic and facultative, and 186 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were staphylococcus aureus (17 isolates), alpha-hemolytic streptococci (14), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12), moraxella catarrhalis (10), and haemophilus spp (8). the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus spp (61), prevotella spp (45),  fusobacterium spp (15), and propionibacterium acnes (14). analysis of the medical histories revealed a correlation only between the microbial results and previous  sinus surgery. pseudomonas aeruginosa and gram-negative aerobic bacilli (gnab) were more often isolated in patients who had surgery (9 of 33 patients had p aeruginosa and 17 had gnab) than in patients who did not have surgery (3 of 75 had p aeruginosa and 7 had gnab; p < .001). anaerobes were isolated more often in patients who did not have surgery (69 of 75 patients) than in those who had previous surgery (21 of 33 patients; p < .001). these findings illustrate the unique microbiological features of chronic maxillary sinusitis that persist after sinus surgery.

TI  == [in vitro activities of levofloxacin and other antibiotics against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == in this study, the in vitro activity of levofloxacin (lvfx) against 1,020 fresh bacterial clinical isolates was compared with the activities of a range of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin (cpfx), ampicillin (abpc), cefaclor, cefpodoxime, methicillin and benzylpenicillin. the clinical isolates except vibrio cholerae were collected in japan during 1998 from patients with infectious diseases. mics  were determined using the agar dilution method according to the recommendations by the japan society of chemotherapy. some isolates of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and coagulase negative staphylococcus were resistant to fluoroquinolones, but the mic50 of lvfx against mrsa was 6.25 micrograms/ml. lvfx was the most active against mrsa among the antibiotics tested. most of staphylococcus epidermidis strains were susceptible to the fluoroquinolones. lvfx showed greater activity against all streptococci strains compared with fluoroquinolones tested. in particular, all streptococcus pneumoniae strains including prsp were susceptible to lvfx at < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml. among enterococcus, abpc showed superior activity against enterococcus faecalis but many isolates of enterococcus species were resistant to abpc. lvfx was more active against to these enterococcus species compared with other fluoroquinolones. on the other hand, lvfx and cpfx showed similar activity against isolates of enterobacteriaceae. cpfx had an mic50/90 of 0.20, 0.39 microgram/ml and lvfx showed an mic50/90 of 0.78, 1.56 micrograms/ml against pseudomonas aeruginosa. lvfx (mic50/90 0.10, 0.20 microgram/ml) was more active against acinetobacter species than cpfx (mic50/90 0.10, 0.39 microgram/ml). haemophilus influenzae, branhamella (moraxella) catarrhalis and v. cholerae were  inhibited by low concentration of the fluoroquinolones tested. the mic90 of lvfx  and cpfx were < or = 0.10 microgram/ml against above three species. some isolates of neisseria gonorrhoeae and campylobacter species were moderately resistant to the fluoroquinolones tested but the mic50 of lvfx and cpfx were < or = 0.39 microgram/ml. among anaerobes, propionibacterium acnes was more susceptible than  peptostreptococcus species, and the mic90 of beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones tested were < or = 0.78 microgram/ml. in conclusion, this study, performed on large number of strains, confirmed an excellent and wide spectrum antibacterial activity of lvfx compared with the fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams tested. and  our results suggest that lvfx may be useful in the treatment of various bacterial infections.

TI  == optimizing breast pocket irrigation: an in vitro study and clinical implications.
AB  == subclinical infections have been implicated in the etiology of capsular contracture. intraoperatively, breast pocket irrigation with povidone-iodine or other antibiotic solutions has been popularized; however, detrimental effects on  wound healing for these agents have been reported and their efficacy against common organisms found around breast implants has not been studied. the purpose of this study was to compare the in vitro efficacy of serial dilutions of povidone-iodine and two double antibiotic solutions dab-1 (gentamicin/polymyxin b) and dab-2 (gentamicin/cefazolin), against organisms most commonly found around breast implants. in phase i trials, serial dilutions of povidone-iodine and dab were combined 1:1 with cultures of five common organisms found around implants. in phase ii, povidone-iodine was serially diluted in dab-1 rather than saline. in phase iii, povidone-iodine was serially diluted with dab-2. efficacy for all phases was determined by plating the mixture onto agar plates and incubating at 37 degrees c for 48 hours. povidone-iodine was 100 percent effective at a dilution of 12.5% against staphylococcus epidermidis and 25% against staphylococcus aureus but relatively ineffective against escherichia coli and pseudomonas, dab-1 was found to be ineffective against s. epidermidis but effective against s. aureus, propionibacterium acnes, e. coli, and pseudomonas. in phase ii trials, a concentration of 12.5% povidone-iodine in dab was effective at killing all experimental bacteria. in phase iii trials, 10% povidone-iodine in dab-2 was effective at killing all bacteria tested. in conclusion, to maximize bacterial control of common breast implant organisms and to minimize the detrimental effects on wound healing, 10% povidone-iodine in gentamycin/cefazolin may be used with excellent results and its use clinically may reduce the incidence of capsular contracture.

AB  == purpose: the study presented differentiates between the aetiological agents of bacterial keratitis in patients with and without a history of contact lens wear.  based on these results, recommendations are given for optimal antibiotic primary  therapy. patients and methods: swabs and corneal scrapings were taken from 218 patients referred to the university eye hospital in munich with a diagnosis of bacterial keratitis from 1989 to 1997. ninety-two of these patients had a history of contact lens wear; 126 had none. the germs were isolated and identified by staining and microscopy. observing polymicrobial growth in 51 patients, a total of 275 germs was isolated. results: the most frequent pathogens were staphylococcus epidermidis (44%), s. aureus (18%), streptococcus spp. (10%), propionibacterium acnes (7%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%). gram-negative germs were nearly exclusively isolated from contact lens wearers, gram-positive germs were predominant in non-contact lens wearers. conclusion: keratitis in patients with a history of contact lens wear is often caused by aggressive gram-negative germs. those cases should immediately be treated with quinolones and erythromycin. in keratitis caused by gram-positive pathogens, a combination with  aminoglycosides and erythromycin is sufficient.

TI  == in vitro viability of external eye microbial flora in hydroxy-propyl-methylcellulose.
AB  == the aim of this study was to verify the in vitro influence of various dilutions of a viscoelastic substance containing 2% hydroxy-propyl-methylcellulose (hpmc) on the viability of some microbial strains representative of the normal flora of  the external eye. pure reference strain cultures of candida albicans, pseudomonas aeruginosa, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and a fresh clinical isolate of proteus mirabilis were selected for this study. serial twofold dilutions of 2% hpmc, prepared so as to obtain a final concentration ranging from 50 to 0.78% of the product in sterile saline solution  (0.85% nacl), were taken out with a pipette that delivered 1.0 ml per tube. one hundred microliters of the abovementioned microbial inocula, used for the evaluation of the positive control of the test organism, were dispensed into each tube. after 24 h of incubation, 100 microl of samples were taken from each tube and plated into the specific medium for the growth of the test organism. after 24-48 h of incubation, these agar plates were examined and the colony-forming-unit count of each test organism was compared to the corresponding total colony count, acting as a positive control, in order to determine the quantitative variation of the test organism grown in the presence of the viscoelastic compounds. c. albicans and p. aeruginosa showed a statistically significant increase in growth with hpmc dilutions varying from 1:2 to 1:16. p. acnes and p. mirabilis growth was significantly reduced by all dilutions except for the 1:128 one. s. epidermidis growth was also significantly reduced in the presence of hpmc dilutions varying from 1:2 to 1:64. s. aureus growth was not significantly influenced. the viability of p. aeruginosa in hpmc dilutions needs  to be carefully considered because of the ability of this organism to induce endophthalmitis, and the possibility that during cataract surgery, a small amount of hpmc may be left in the eye, trapped behind the intraocular lens optic.

TI  == [bacterial keratitis in patients with and without contact lens anamnesis].
AB  == background: the study shows differences between contact lens wearers and patients without history of contact lenses regarding the spectrum of etiological agents in bacterial keratitis. based on microbiological analysis, there are given recommendations for an optimal initial antibiotic treatment in both groups. material and methods: from 1989 to 1997 smears, scrapings and corneal biopsies were taken from 218 patients with bacterial keratitis. the causing pathogens were isolated on directly inoculated culture media and identified by staining and microscopy. the resistance pattern of a total of 275 germs was analysed for different antibiotics. results: the most frequently isolated germs were staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus spp., propionibacterium acnes and pseudomonas aeruginosa. whereas sensitive gram-positive germs were predominating in contact lens wearers as well as in non-contact lens wearers, multiresistant gram-negative germs could nearly exclusively be isolated from contact lens wearers. frequently administered antibiotics like aminoglycosides and quinolones are effective in infections caused by staphylococcus spp., but increasing resistance could be seen to streptococcus spp. in this case, erythromycin is very sensitive. gram-negative germs like pseudomonas aeruginosa are sensitive to quinolones and some aminoglycosides (e.g. tobramycin). conclusion: in contact lens wearers, more aggressive germs have to be considered than in non-contact lens wearers. in such  cases, frequently administered antibiotics like amino-glycosides are not effective. to cover problematic gram-negative germs we recommend the application  of quinolones alternating with erythromycin. the latter one is more effective than quinolones and aminoglycosides in case of streptococcus spp. co-involvement.

TI  == use of a low nutrient culture medium for the identification of bacteria causing severe ocular infection.
AB  == a low nutrient culture medium was used to identify the pathogens in four cases of persisting ocular infection. bacto r2a agar was used in addition to conventional  liquid- and solid-phase media to culture pathogenic bacteria from one case of recurrent keratitis, one case of suture-related keratitis with endophthalmitis and two eyes (two patients) with post-operative endophthalmitis. in each case, a  pathogen was identified solely with r2a agar after culture for 6 days. species isolated were pseudomonas aeruginosa (one), propionibacterium acnes (two) and staphylococcus aureus (one). antibiotic therapy was tailored to conform to the sensitivity of the cultured organism in each case. the use of bacto r2a low nutrient agar should be considered in culture negative eyes not showing clinical  improvement, or for chronic cases where bacteria may have become adapted to more  stringent ocular environments.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

TI  == orbital infections in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection.
AB  == background: opportunistic infections frequently involve the anterior and posterior segments of the eye but rarely occur in the orbit in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection. the authors managed eight patients  with hiv and unilateral orbital infections who presented between july 1988 and march 1995. methods: records of the patients were reviewed. a literature review of orbital infections in patients infected with hiv also was conducted. results:  there were five men and three women, with a mean age of 33.8 years. the mean cd-4 cell count from five of the eight patients was 18.4 cells/mm3. invasive aspergillosis was the most common orbital infection occurring in four patients, all of whom had contiguous sinus involvement and intracranial extension. orbital  cellulitis with subperiosteal abscesses secondary to ethmoiditis caused by propionibacterium acnes and pseudomonas aeruginosa developed in two patients. orbital cellulitis and panophthalmitis secondary to staphylococcus aureus endogenous endophthalmitis developed in one patient, and one patient had presumed syphilitic optic neuritis, orbital periostitis, and necrotizing vasculitis. five  patients had permanent visual loss, including four who had loss of light perception. four patients died of orbital diseases within 1 year of presentation, and three deaths were attributed to intracranial spread of aspergillus fumigatus. other organisms reported in the literature that caused orbital infections in patients with hiv include rhizopus arrhizus, toxoplasma gondii, and pneumocystis  carinii. conclusion: opportunistic infections of the orbit from bacterial, fungal, and parasitic organisms should be recognized as a serious complication of systemic hiv infection and are associated with a high ocular morbidity and mortality rate.

TI  == [antibiotic prophylaxis in open fractures].
AB  == the administration of antibiotics is now generally accepted as a prophylactic treatment of infection in compound fractures. nevertheless the question is not completely resolved and many problems are still to be discussed.the efficacy of antibiotherapy in this field has just been recently demonstrated ; with the animals by worlock et al. (1988) using an experimental rabbit model, and clinically by braul et al. (1987) which randomized 87 patients with open fractures to receive either cloxacillin or placebo. the rate of infection was significantly lower in the antibiotic group.no reports comparing various antimicrobial drugs draw effective conclusions regarding the choice of antibiotics. in the same way it seems that the time of interval from injury to antibiotic administration was not associated with a significantly different incidence of infection.the study of duration of the treatment was perfectly conducted by dellinger. in his prospective trial 248 patients received different  doses of the same antibiotic, from a single dose to four doses daily during 5 days. in conclusion he found no relation between the duration of the treatment and the risk of infection.a semantic but very important question concerns the reality of a preventive action of antibiotics against infection in open fractures. in order to answer, it is necessary to assess the incidence of contamination, its nature and its density.according to papers reporting the results of early cultures of the fracture wound, bacterial contamination was present in 30-70% of the cases. but the bacteria most commonly isolated were members of the normal skin flora (staphylococcus epidermidis, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium sp. micrococcus) or environmental contaminants which infrequently were the cause of infection.the specimens taken from patients who have an infection show mostly hospitalacquired bacteria as staphylococcus aureus  or pseudomonas aeruginosa. these findings emphasize the risk of colonization of the wound by nosocomial bacteria.in addition, it seems that the density of contamination may also be a determinant of subsequent clinical infection. quantitative bacterial counts suggest a greater risk of infection when microorganisms were present in high number more than 105 colony forming unit per  g. of tissue.in conclusion, the prophylactic action of antibiotics against infection in open fractures is well established, but many points are still subject to discussion and need further study. furthermore antibioprophylaxis is only a complement to surgical treatment, debridement and immobilization, which remains of paramount importance.

AB  == increasing reports of gentamicin-resistant bacteria contaminating donor corneas and causing endophthalmitis have indicated that preservation of corneal storage media with 100 micrograms/ml of gentamicin alone needs reevaluation. we investigated the stability and possible cytotoxicity of streptomycin as a supplement to gentamicin in optisol corneal storage medium. the combination of gentamicin and streptomycin in optisol solution was stable at room temperature for at least 4 weeks and inhibited the growth of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, alpha hemolytic streptococci, streptococcus group d, propionibacterium acnes, escherichia coli, and diphtheroids, but not pseudomonas  aeruginosa. the addition of vancomycin did not significantly improve the antibacterial effectiveness of the gentamicin and streptomycin combination when stored at 4 degrees c. the growth of 15 of 20 clinical ocular isolates of ps. aeruginosa was suppressed by the gentamicin-streptomycin combination. streptomycin in concentrations of up to 1,000 micrograms/ml did not decrease the  mitotic activity of corneal endothelial cells as evaluated by the in vitro incorporation of tritiated thymidine or cause cytotoxicity. the addition of 200 micrograms/ml of streptomycin to optisol corneal storage medium containing 100 micrograms/ml of gentamicin may significantly improve activity against gentamicin-sensitive and gentamicin-resistant contaminants.

AB  == mersacidin, a new peptide antibiotic, was four- to eightfold less active (mic for 90% of isolates, 8 micrograms/ml) than vancomycin, teicoplanin, or daptomycin against staphylococcus aureus. coagulase-negative staphylococci were inhibited by 8 micrograms/ml, and the mics of mersacidin for hemolytic streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae were 4 to 8 micrograms/ml. the mersacidin mics for anaerobic organisms were as follows: clostridium perfringens, 4 micrograms/ml; propionibacterium acnes, 8 micrograms/ml; peptococci, 1 microgram/ml; and peptostreptococci, 8 micrograms/ml. mersacidin had no activity against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, neisseria and haemophilus species, or pseudomonas  aeruginosa. the size of the inoculum, the ph of the assay (5.5 to 7.5), the type  of medium, and the anaerobic conditions had minimal effects on the mics and mbcs  of mersacidin. overall, mersacidin proved less active than available glycopeptides and peptolides.

TI  == bacteria from solid tumours.
AB  == bacteria were grown from 63 (69%) of 91 specimens from necrotic tumours in 63 patients. of the tumours, 14 were abdominal, 5 pelvic, 23 of the head and neck, 4 of the lungs, 4 mediastinal, 2 lymphatic, 3 of the breast, and 8 were miscellaneous. aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria only were present in 12 (19%) specimens, anaerobes only in 10 (16%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 41 (65%). a total of 83 anaerobic and 47 aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria were isolated. the predominant anaerobic bacteria were bacteroides spp. (36 isolates), and anaerobic cocci (21) and propionibacterium acnes (22). the aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria most frequently isolated were staphylococcus aureus, alpha-haemolytic streptococci, escherichia coli (seven isolates each), s. epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa (five isolates each). these data demonstrate that infection of tumours is usually polymicrobial.

TI  == recurrent postoperative endophthalmitis.
AB  == we treated five patients for postoperative endophthalmitis who demonstrated an initially good response to intravitreal management of their infection and then suffered a later recurrence. four of the five patients received a single intravitreal injection of antibiotics as the only intravitreal therapy, and the fifth patient received a single antibiotic injection in addition to a partial vitrectomy. all recurrent infections occurred between 10 and 21 days after the original intravitreal injection of antibiotics. at the time of the recurrence, all five patients remained culture positive with the same organism that was initially isolated. the bacterial species isolated were s. epidermidis, group d streptococcus, p. acnes, p. mirabilis, and p. aeruginosa. all patients were ultimately sterilized with repeated intravitreal injections of antibiotics, vitrectomy, and/or intraocular lens removal. factors that were related to recurrent infection were marginal susceptibility of the organism to the originally injected antibiotics, infection with a slowly replicating organism, and infection with a gram-negative bacillus. a single intravitreal injection of antibiotics may only partially treat bacterial endophthalmitis. patients should be observed for at least 3 weeks following treatment of endophthalmitis for recurrence of their infection, and aggressive management, including vitrectomy and repeated intravitreal injections of antibiotics, should be used to treat recurrent infections.

TI  == protective effect of saikosaponin a, saikosaponin d and saikogenin d against pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in mice.
AB  == effects of saikosaponins and their genins on nonspecific resistance against pseudomonas aeruginosa and listeria monocytogenes infections were investigated. when mice were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) saikosaponins one day before i.p. infection with p. aeruginosa, saikosaponins a and d induced a marked enhancement of nonspecific resistance at a dose of 10 micrograms/mouse. also, saikogenin d, a secondary metabolite of saikosaponin d, showed an enhancing effect. the most effective condition for enhancing the nonspecific resistance was i.p. administration of saikosaponin d one day before i.p. or intravenous (i.v.) infection with p. aeruginosa, when mice were treated i.p., i.v., or subcutaneously with saikosaponin d 1, 4 or 7 days previously. effect of saikosaponin d was weaker than that of formalin-killed bacilli of propionibacterium acnes and lipopolysaccharide. on the other hand, effect of saikosaponin d on enhancement of nonspecific resistance against l. monocytogenes  was not seen. effector cells participating in the enhanced protection induced by  saikosaponin d may be macrophages, since macrophages were a major component in peritoneal cells obtained from mice administered i.p. saikosaponin d 1 day earlier and intracellular bactericidal activity of peritoneal macrophages against p. aeruginosa increased.

TI  == phototoxicity of skin microorganisms tested with a new model.
AB  == a new standardized method for testing phototoxicity of chemicals against microorganisms is described. the inoculum size of the microorganism, application  of test chemicals, prediffusion time, incubation time and incubation period are defined. staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, candida albicans, and pityrosporum orbiculare were studied. both 8-methoxypsoralen and trimethylpsoralen were phototoxic against all microorganisms tested, while tetracycline and doxycycline were not phototoxic. c. albicans may be chosen for phototoxicity testing because it has been used earlier, it is easy to maintain in culture, it grows easily when tested, and its pathogenicity is low. the phototoxicity of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, propionibacterium acnes, c. albicans, and p. orbiculare against each other were also investigated. only p. orbiculare was inhibitory. it inhibited the growth of  s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and ps. aeruginosa - both in the dark and after irradiation. the growth inhibition was markedly enhanced after uva irradiation, indicating phototoxicity. the phototoxic effect of p. orbiculare may play a role  in the ecology of the human skin flora.

TI  == antitumor effect of normal intestinal microflora on ehrlich ascites tumor.
AB  == in order to investigate the antitumor activity of intestinal microflora, the constitution of normal flora was examined in humans, guinea pigs and mice. it was clarified that eubacterium, bifidobacterium and bacteroides were the predominant  bacterial genera in humans. in addition, neither clostridium nor enterobacteriaceae was detected in guinea pigs and neither clostridium nor bifidobacterium was present in mice. total bacterial counts in tumor-bearing mice were reduced in comparison with those in normal mice. especially, in the ileum of tumor-bearing mice, the incidence of anaerobic bacterial genera was strikingly decreased. from the bacteria found, 59 living and killed strains isolated from intestinal microflora were examined for antitumor activity against ehrlich ascites tumor. it was observed that 11 of the tested strains had antitumor activity. four of these were toxic to the host, and in particular, all mice injected with pseudomonas aeruginosa (tym-8) died within several days. eubacterium lentum (tyh-11), propionibacterium acnes (tym-28), proteus mirabilis  (tym-7) and serratia marcescens (ty-142), in which antitumor activity was recognized with living and formalin-killed bacteria, cured the tumor-bearing mice, and the culture supernatant of s. marcescens contained apparent antitumor activity.

TI  == changes in expression of bacterial surface antigens induced by antibiotics and their influence on host defenses.
AB  == concomitant with the discovery that a number of antibiotics were able to induce profound morphological changes (increased septation, thickened walls, filamentation) at low concentrations their ability to inhibit bacterial protein/polysaccharide synthesis was determined. in particular toxin and extracellular enzyme biosynthesis could be repressed by the lincosamines, fusidic acid, erythromycin and streptomycin in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. several of these exoproducts act as antigens associated with microbial virulence  and are therefore of importance in pathogenicity. likewise structural components  such as fimbriae in escherichia coli, m protein in streptococcus pyogenes, protein a in staphylococcus aureus and capsule in bacteroides fragilis and haemophilus influenzae were not synthesised when the producer bacteria were grown in low concentrations of antibiotic. these products, through their importance as  impedins of opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis by white blood cells, are important determinants in the host-parasite relationship. by their loss during drug exposure, potentiation of opsonophagocytosis occurred leading to more rapid  killing of the pathogen. the immunogenicity of the antibiotic-damaged bacteria was also changed under these circumstances.

TI  == protease production by microorganisms associated with reproductive tract infection.
AB  == factors influencing pathogenicity of various microbes found in the female lower genital tract remain incompletely understood. protease production by cervico/vaginal microorganisms may alter or inactivate a variety of proteins important in host defense and structural-functional integrity including collagen-containing chorioamniotic membranes and uterine cervix. host tissues may be made more susceptible to other organisms' virulence factors by protease-producing members of genital tract local flora. microorganisms themselves may also be influenced by the presence of other microbial protease. nonspecific protease, gelatinase, collagenase, and elastase production was examined for in vitro with use of aerobic (30) and anaerobic (25) strains of microorganisms typical of those isolated from the lower genital tract of women with premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, and puerperal infection. microorganisms including bacteroides bivius, bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus species, and propionibacterium acnes produce various proteases. protease production by both acknowledged pathogenic and commensal bacteria may contribute to the occurrence of reproductive tract morbidity including premature rupture of membranes and preterm labor.

TI  == evaluation of the sterility and stability of insulin from multidose vials used for prolonged periods.
AB  == diabetic patients frequently use their insulin vials for prolonged periods, even  though antibacterial preservatives used in multidose insulin vials are not required to be effective beyond 28 days. for this reason, we evaluated the antibacterial activity present in multidose insulin vials for up to 50 days. multidose lente insulin vials were inoculated with s. aureus and p. aeruginosa. vials incubated at room temperature (21 degrees c) were sterile by 48 hours, whereas when they were incubated at refrigerator temperatures (4 degrees c), s. aureus contamination persisted up to the 17th day and p. aeruginosa were killed after 10 days. the same vials were serially contaminated on days 17, 30, and 50,  and a similar antibacterial effect was maintained. sixty-nine multidose insulin vials used for an average of 53 days were cultured. eight vials demonstrated bacterial contamination with 1 cfu/ml of s. epidermidis or propionibacterium acnes. no endotoxin was detected in the multidose vials used for more than 28 days. insulin assays on 40 multidose insulin vials used for more than 28 days showed an average insulin content of 101.6 +/- 1.9 units/ml. this study did not demonstrate significant bacterial contamination, endotoxin activity, or insulin degradation of multidose insulin in vials used for periods longer than 28 days. in addition, antibacterial preservatives were more effective at room temperature  than at refrigerator temperature; thus, the practice of patients not refrigerating insulin vials is sensible.

TI  == protective effect of lactobacillus casei on pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in mice.
AB  == the protective effect of heat-killed lactobacillus casei yit9018 (lc 9018) against pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in mice was compared with that of corynebacterium parvum. survival of mice after intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection with p. aeruginosa was augmented in mice that had been pretreated i.p. with lc 9018 5 days previously. similar treatment of mice with c. parvum, however, was not effective at all. moreover, mice became more susceptible to infection with p. aeruginosa after such treatment. growth of p. aeruginosa in the peritoneal cavity and spleen was markedly inhibited in lc 9018-pretreated mice, whereas such inhibition of bacterial growth was not observed in c. parvum-treated mice. the protective effect of lc 9018 was observed in mice subjected to 800 rads of whole  body irradiation but was abrogated when mice were treated with carrageenan. these results suggest that augmentation of the resistance of mice to p. aeruginosa was  caused by the induction of activated macrophages. the number of macrophages detectable in the peritoneal cavity was almost the same in lc 9018- and c. parvum-treated mice. growth of listeria monocytogenes was inhibited by pretreatment with lc 9018. inhibition of l. monocytogenes was also observed after the same pretreatment with c. parvum. it was suggested that macrophages activated with lc 9018 were involved in the protective immunity to p. aeruginosa.

TI  == [antibacterial effects of niridazole. ii. effects on aerobic and anaerobic bacteria].
AB  == niridazole which is chemically related to metronidazole is endowed with much better antibacterial activity. first, several genera of aerobic bacteria, such as salmonella and escherichia, are susceptible to niridazole, whereas metronidazole  is completely ineffective. there exist, however, some particular strains which are naturally resistant to niridazole. the in vitro activity of niridazole is still increased, if these facultative anaerobic bacteria are tested under anaerobic growth conditions. second, niridazole has a higher in vitro activity against anaerobic bacteria, such as bacteroides spp., clostridium spp., fusobacterium spp. and peptococcus sp., than metronidazole. extremely low mic values of niridazole were found ranging from 0.0037 to 0.06 microgram/ml. propionibacterium acnes, which are resistant to the action of metronidazole, are  also relatively resistant to niridazole.

TI  == phagocytic and chemiluminescent responses of mouse peritoneal macrophages to living and killed salmonella typhimurium and other bacteria.
AB  == in the presence of luminol, resident as well as thioglycolate-induced and immunized macrophages emitted chemiluminescence more efficiently when the cells were exposed to living salmonella typhimurium than when they were exposed to the  same bacterium killed by ultraviolet light or heat. this phenomenon was observed  whether or not the bacterium was opsonized. the different response to living and  killed bacteria was also found with escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus morganii, and enterobacter aerogenes, but not with shigella sonnei, klebsiella pneumoniae, and propionibacterium acnes. the results suggest that macrophages respond better to living, motile bacteria than to nonmotile or killed bacteria. the experimental results obtained with motility mutants of s. typhimurium, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa confirm that macrophages exposed to the motile bacteria emit chemiluminescence more efficiently and ingest the motile bacteria at a much faster rate than the nonmotile bacteria.

TI  == pharmacologic factors and manipulation of immunity systemic adjuvants in cancer therapy.
AB  == because of the experimental and clinical studies which have been extensively conducted with bacillus calmette-guerin (bcg) as a systemic adjuvant in cancer immunotherapy, we have analyzed the main factors and conditions which determine its beneficial action and have underlined some of these (eg, the dose factor which controls the amplification of suppressor cells which is probably responsible for failures and even the possible tumor-enhancing effect of immunotherapy). knowing those factors and conditions, we have been able to establish a systematic immunopharmacologic study of systemic immunity adjuvants,  which has resulted in the discovery of agents whose actions are more rapid than that of bcg on one or a few populations of cells involved in immunity and which,  unlike bcg, do not induce suppressor cell amplification. this amplification may explain the difference in the results obtained with this mycobacterium in various clinical immunotherapy trials in which it was applied differently. it is proposed to combine these mono- or pauc-functional adjuvants in order to try to obtain all of the beneficial effects of bcg without the amplification of suppressor cells.

TI  == adjuvant protection against bacterial infection in granulocytopenic mice.
AB  == the hypothesis that the induction of nonspecific resistance to infection by immunostimulation prior to drug-induced granulocytopenia would afford increased protection to subsequent bacterial challenge was tested in a murine model of infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa or staphylococcus aureus in mice rendered granulocytopenic with cyclophosphamide. prior intraperitoneal immunostimulation of mice with complete freund's adjuvant (cfa) or mycobacterium bovis (bacille calmette-guerin; bcg) increased the 50% lethal dose in mice challenged subcutaneously with p. aeruginosa, but only cfa protected against challenge with  s. aureus. the degree of protection was 1-2 log 10. corynebacterium parvum provided no protection against infection with p. aeruginosa. the protective effect observed with cfa and bcg substantiates our hypothesis and indicates that  nonspecific immunostimulation may be of value in protection of granulocytopenic patients from opportunistic infections.
