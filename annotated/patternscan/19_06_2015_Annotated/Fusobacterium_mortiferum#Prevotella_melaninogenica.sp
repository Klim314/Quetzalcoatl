TI  == time-kill study of the activity of trovafloxacin compared with ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam  against six anaerobes.
AB  == a time-kill method was developed to examine the killing kinetics of trovafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam against one strain each of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, prevotella melaninogenica, fusobacterium  mortiferum, peptostreptococcus magnus and clostridium perfringens. solutions and  suspensions were prepared inside an anaerobic glove box, using syringes and prereduced broth. bottles were then incubated outside the chamber and viability counts determined after incubation for 0, 6, 24 and 48 h in a shaking water bath, avoiding introduction of air. bacteriostatic/bactericidal concentrations (mg/l) after 48 h for the six strains were: trovafloxacin, 0.03-1/0.03-1; ciprofloxacin, 0.25-16/0.25-32; sparfloxacin, 0.06-2/0.06-8; metronidazole 1-64/1-64; cefoxitin, 0.125-16/0.125-32; piperacillin, 0.125-64/0.125-64; piperacillin/tazobactam, 0.06-2/0.125-8. bacteriostatic levels were within two dilutions of broth mics. by this time-kill method, trovafloxacin had the lowest bacteriostatic concentrations of all compounds tested.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of bacteroides and other genera of gram-negative anaerobic rods.
AB  == a numerical taxonomy was performed on 157 cultures (141 different strains) of species of bacteroides, polyphyromonas, prevotella [not prevotella (labroue, 1976)] and fusobacterium. isolates were each tested for 111 phenotypic characters which included possession of constitutive enzymes, fermentation of specific carbohydrates, gas chromatographic analysis of metabolic end-products and of cellular carboxylic acid composition. computation of similarity coefficients was  followed by a single-linkage cluster analysis. at the 94% similarity level, the following groupings at genus level were apparent: (1) bacteroides ureolyticus; (2) fusobacterium mortiferum, f. necrogenes, f. necrophorum, f. nucleatum and f.  varium; (3) b. caccae, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. fragilis, b. merdae, b. ovatus, b stercoris, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformus and b. vulgatus; (4) b. splanchnicus; (5) porphyromonas asaccharolytica; (6) b. bivius (prevotella bivia); (7) b. disiens (p. disiens); (8) b. intermedius (p. intermedia);and (9) b. melaninogenicus (p. melaninogenica). single isolates of b. ruminicola (p. ruminicola), b. denticola (p. denticola) and b. capillosus did not cluster with other strains.
