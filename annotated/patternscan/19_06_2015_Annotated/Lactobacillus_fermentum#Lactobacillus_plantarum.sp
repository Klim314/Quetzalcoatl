TI  == development of a quantitative pcr assay for rapid detection of lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus fermentum in cocoa bean fermentation.
AB  == to monitor dominant species of lactic acid bacteria during cocoa bean fermentation, i.e. lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus fermentum, a fast and reliable culture-independent qpcr assay was developed. a modified dna isolation procedure using a commercial kit followed by two species-specific qpcr  assays resulted in 100% sensitivity for l. plantarum and l. fermentum. kruskal-wallis and post-hoc analyses of data obtained from experiments with cocoa beans that were artificially spiked with decimal concentrations of l. plantarum and l. fermentum strains allowed the calculation of a regression line suitable for the estimation of both species with a detection limit of 3 to 4logcells/g cocoa beans. this process was successfully tested for efficacy through the analyses of samples from laboratory-scale cocoa bean fermentations with both the  qpcr assay and a culture-dependent method which resulted in comparable results.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == production of wheat bread without preservatives using sourdough starters.
AB  == in order for the beneficial effects of sourdough application in breadmaking to take place a proper selection of lactic acid bacteria species and strains, an appropriate technology and effective control of the purity and activity of the selected cultures. four symbiotic starters for sourdough for the production of bread were developed and probated in a production laboratory using the selected strains lactobacillus brevis lbrz7, l. buchneri lbrz6, l. plantarum x2, l. paracasei rn5, l. sanfranciscensis r and l. fermentum lbrh10 and the probiotic strain propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii nbimcc 327. the starter sourdoughs that include propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii nbimcc 327 had greater antimicrobial activity against saprophytic microorganisms: bacillus subtilis, b. mesentericus, aspergillus niger, penicillium sp. and rhizopus sp., but none of them inhibited the growth of bakery yeasts saccharomyces cerevisiae. it was established that in order to prevent bacterial spoilage 10% of the selected starter sourdoughs had to be added in the breadmaking process, while for prevention of mold spoilage the necessary amount of starter sourdough had to be between 15% and 20%.the application of the developed starters for the production of wheat bread guarantees longer shelf life and no adverse alterations in the features of the final bread.

TI  == examination of the technological properties of newly isolated strains of the genus and possibilities for their application in the composition of starters.
AB  == the ability of four lactobacillus strains - lactobacillus brevis lbrz7 (isolated  from fermented cabbage), lactobacillus plantarum lbrz12 (isolated from fermented  cabbage), lactobacillus fermentum lbrh9 (of human origin) and lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus lbrc11 (isolated from home-made cheese) - to grow in flour/water environment and to accumulate high concentrations of viable cells was examined. two starters for sourdough were created for lab-scale production of wheat bread:  a two-strain starter and a four-strain starter. wheat bread with improved properties - greater loaf volume, enhanced flavour and softer and brighter crumb  - was obtained from the 7% four-strain starter sourdough. the addition of sourdough in the production of wheat bread affected positively the technological  and organoleptic characteristics of the final bread by inhibiting the growth of wild yeasts and mold and bacillus spores without the addition of preservatives. the inclusion of 15% of the four-strain starter sourdough in the bread-making process led to enhanced safety and longer shelf life of the baked bread.

TI  == molecular identification and quantification of lactic acid bacteria in traditional fermented dairy foods of russia.
AB  == russian traditional fermented dairy foods have been consumed for thousands of years. however, little research has focused on exploiting lactic acid bacteria (lab) resources and analyzing the lab composition of russian traditional fermented dairy foods. in the present study, we cultured lab isolated from fermented mare and cow milks, sour cream, and cheese collected from kalmykiya, buryats, and tuva regions of russia. seven lactobacillus species and the bifidobacterium genus were quantified by quantitative pcr. the lab counts in these samples ranged from 3.18 to 9.77 log cfu/ml (or per gram). in total, 599 lab strains were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. the identified lab belonged to 7 genera and 30 species by 16s  rrna and mure gene sequencing and multiplex pcr assay. the predominant lab isolates were lactobacillus helveticus (176 strains) and lactobacillus plantarum  (63 strains), which represented 39.9% of all isolates. the quantitative pcr results revealed that counts of 7 lactobacilli species and bifidobacterium spp. of 30 fermented cow milk samples ranged from 1.19 +/- 0.34 (lactobacillus helveticus in tuva) to 8.09 +/- 0.71 (lactobacillus acidophilus in kalmykiya) log cfu/ml of fermented cow milk (mean +/- standard error). the numbers of bifidobacterium spp., lb. plantarum, lb. helveticus, and lb. acidophilus revealed no significant difference between the 3 regions; nevertheless, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus sakei, and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus exhibited different degrees of variation across 3 regions. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of russia have complex compositions of lab species. the diversity of lab might be related to the type of fermented dairy product, geographical origin, and manufacturing process.

TI  == the effect of lactic acid bacteria on cocoa bean fermentation.
AB  == cocoa beans (theobroma cacao l.) are the raw material for chocolate production. fermentation of cocoa pulp by microorganisms is crucial for developing chocolate  flavor precursors. yeasts conduct an alcoholic fermentation within the bean pulp  that is essential for the production of good quality beans, giving typical chocolate characters. however, the roles of bacteria such as lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid bacteria in contributing to the quality of cocoa bean and chocolate are not fully understood. using controlled laboratory fermentations, this study investigated the contribution of lactic acid bacteria to cocoa bean fermentation. cocoa beans were fermented under conditions where the growth of lactic acid bacteria was restricted by the use of nisin and lysozyme. the resultant microbial ecology, chemistry and chocolate quality of beans from these  fermentations were compared with those of indigenous (control) fermentations. the yeasts hanseniaspora guilliermondii, pichia kudriavzevii, kluyveromyces marxianus and saccharomyces cerevisiae, the lactic acid bacteria lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus pentosus and lactobacillus fermentum and the acetic acid bacteria acetobacter pasteurianus and gluconobacter frateurii were the major species found in control fermentations. in fermentations with the presence of nisin and lysozyme, the same species of yeasts and acetic acid bacteria grew but the growth of lactic acid bacteria was prevented or restricted. these beans underwent characteristic alcoholic fermentation where the utilization of sugars and the production of ethanol, organic acids and volatile compounds in the bean pulp and  nibs were similar for beans fermented in the presence of lactic acid bacteria. lactic acid was produced during both fermentations but more so when lactic acid bacteria grew. beans fermented in the presence or absence of lactic acid bacteria were fully fermented, had similar shell weights and gave acceptable chocolates with no differences in sensory rankings. it was concluded that lactic acid bacteria may not be necessary for successful cocoa fermentation.

TI  == the use of pfge method in genotyping of selected bacteria species of the lactobacillus genus.
AB  == bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus are a group of microorganisms in which there are numerous strains with high probiotic potential. in recent years,  interest in probiotics as nutritional supplements and as drugs has significantly  increased. in order to carry out research on probiotic bacterial strains, their beneficial effects on the human body should be confirmed and molecular typing should be carried out with the aim of marking a specific strain. pulse-field gel  electrophoresis (pfge) is the reference method employed for bacterial genotyping, but it is commonly used for typing mainly pathogenic bacteria. the following study describes a way of performing pfge analysis in genotyping of bacteria species belonging to the genus lactobacillus: l. fermentum, l. gasseri, l. plantarum and l. rhamnosus.

TI  == zebrafish gut colonization by mcherry-labelled lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == a critical feature of probiotic microorganisms is their ability to colonize the intestine of the host. although the microbial potential to adhere to the human gut lumen has been investigated in in vitro models, there is still much to discover about their in vivo behaviour. zebrafish is a vertebrate model that is being widely used to investigate various biological processes shared with humans. in this work, we report on the use of the zebrafish model to investigate the in vivo colonization ability of previously characterized probiotic lactic acid bacteria. lactobacillus plantarum lp90, l. plantarum b2 and lactobacillus fermentum pbcc11.5 were fluorescently tagged by transfer of the prcr12 plasmid, which encodes the mcherry protein and which was constructed in this work. the recombinant bacteria were used to infect germ-free zebrafish larvae. after removal of bacteria, the colonization ability of the strains was monitored until  3 days post-infection by using a fluorescence stereomicroscope. the results indicated differential adhesion capabilities among the strains. interestingly, a  displacement of bacteria from the medium to the posterior intestinal tract was observed as a function of time that suggested a transient colonization by probiotics. based on fluorescence observation, l. plantarum strains exhibited a more robust adhesion capability. in conclusion, the use of prcr12 plasmid for labelling lactobacillus strains provides a powerful and very efficient tool to monitor the in vivo colonization in zebrafish larvae and to investigate the adhesion ability of probiotic microorganisms.

TI  == phenotypic identification and technological attributes of native lactic acid bacteria present in fermented bamboo shoot products from north-east india.
AB  == fermented bamboo shoots such as soibum, soidon, eup, hirring, hecche and ekung etc. are non-salted acidic products obtained by natural fermentation predominantly with lactic acid bacteria (lab). in this study, we have characterized 11-representative lab that includes, lactobacillus sp. (n = 2), lactobacillus plantarum (n = 3), and one each of lactobacillus fermentum, lactococcus sp., lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus curvatus, leuconostoc sp. and lactobacillus xylosus. subsequently, these cultures were studied for their technological and functional properties. different isolates exhibited variation in their activities. l. brevis showed maximum phytic acid degradation ability (19.33 u ml (-1) ). l. xylosus had highest protease activity (64.2 nmol/ml) and also exhibited lipolytic activity. in addition, degree of cell hydrophobicity among these cultures ranged between 12.5 and 93.48 % with l. plantarum (sm2) showing highest degree of activity. lactobacillus plantarum was the most common species found in the product studied. results indicated that most of the labs showed putative probiotic as well as antagonistic properties against the selected pathogenic bacteria. characteristic aroma, flavour and texture in the fermented bamboo shoot products could be attributed to presence of these new lab isolates.

TI  == human intestinal mucosa-associated lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains with probiotic properties modulate il-10, il-6 and il-12 gene expression in thp-1 cells.
AB  == lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are considered one of the permanent genera of the physiological human intestinal microbiota and represent an enormous pool of potential probiotic candidates. approximately 450 isolates of presumptive lactobacillus or bifidobacterium strains were obtained from bioptic samples of colonic and ileal mucosa from 15 adolescents aged 12 to 18 years. on the basis of randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis, 20 strains were selected  for further taxonomic classification and characterisation, as well as assessment  of probiotic properties and safety. importantly, selected strains showed the capability of colonising different parts of the intestine. the most frequently isolated species was lactobacillus paracasei followed by lactobacillus fermentum. the majority of isolates were susceptible to antimicrobials of human and veterinary importance, however, tetracycline and/or erythromycin resistance was observed in lactobacillus plantarum and l. fermentum strains. thirteen strains were able to ferment more than 19 different carbon sources and three out of five  tested strains exerted antagonistic activity against several different indicator  strains. two lactobacillus isolates (l. paracasei l350 and l. fermentum l930 bb)  and one bifidobacterium isolate (bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis im386)  fulfilled in vitro selection criteria for probiotic strains and exhibited strong  downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines il-6 and il-12 and upregulation of anti-inflammatory il-10. the selected strains represent suitable candidates for further studies regarding their positive influence on host health and could play  an important role in ameliorating the symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases.

TI  == fermented fruits and vegetables of asia: a potential source of probiotics.
AB  == as world population increases, lactic acid fermentation is expected to become an  important role in preserving fresh vegetables, fruits, and other food items for feeding humanity in developing countries. however, several fermented fruits and vegetables products (sauerkraut, kimchi, gundruk, khalpi, sinki, etc.) have a long history in human nutrition from ancient ages and are associated with the several social aspects of different communities. among the food items, fruits and vegetables are easily perishable commodities due to their high water activity and nutritive values. these conditions are more critical in tropical and subtropical  countries which favour the growth of spoilage causing microorganisms. lactic acid fermentation increases shelf life of fruits and vegetables and also enhances several beneficial properties, including nutritive value and flavours, and reduces toxicity. fermented fruits and vegetables can be used as a potential source of probiotics as they harbour several lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus plantarum, l. pentosus, l. brevis, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, leuconostoc fallax, and l. mesenteroides. as a whole, the traditionally fermented fruits and vegetables not only serve as food supplements but also attribute towards health benefits. this review aims to describe some important asian fermented fruits and vegetables and their significance as a potential source of probiotics.

TI  == cholesterol assimilation by lactobacillus probiotic bacteria: an in vitro investigation.
AB  == excess cholesterol is associated with cardiovascular diseases (cvd), an important cause of mortality worldwide. current cvd therapeutic measures, lifestyle and dietary interventions, and pharmaceutical agents for regulating cholesterol levels are inadequate. probiotic bacteria have demonstrated potential to lower cholesterol levels by different mechanisms, including bile salt hydrolase activity, production of compounds that inhibit enzymes such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a, and cholesterol assimilation. this work investigates 11 lactobacillus strains for cholesterol assimilation. probiotic strains for investigation were selected from the literature: lactobacillus reuteri ncimb 11951, l. reuteri ncimb 701359, l. reuteri ncimb 702655, l. reuteri ncimb 701089, l. reuteri ncimb 702656, lactobacillus fermentum ncimb 5221, l. fermentum ncimb 8829, l. fermentum ncimb 2797, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103 gg, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 314, and lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917. cholesterol assimilation was investigated in culture media and under simulated intestinal conditions. the best cholesterol assimilator was l. plantarum atcc 14917 (15.18+/-0.55 mg/10(10) cfu) in mrs broth. l. reuteri ncimb 701089 assimilated over 67% (2254.70+/-63.33 mg/10(10) cfu) of cholesterol, the most of  all the strains, under intestinal conditions. this work demonstrates that probiotic bacteria can assimilate cholesterol under intestinal conditions, with l. reuteri ncimb 701089 showing great potential as a cvd therapeutic.

TI  == effectiveness of the two microorganisms lactobacillus fermentum lf15 and lactobacillus plantarum lp01, formulated in slow-release vaginal tablets, in women affected by bacterial vaginosis: a pilot study.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common reason for abnormal vaginal discharge in reproductive-age women and one of its most important causative agents is the gram-variable bacterium gardnerella vaginalis. bv is not  accompanied by significant local inflammation, whereas the "fishy odor" test is always positive. in contrast, aerobic vaginitis (av) is predominantly associated  with escherichia coli, but streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus are also involved. standard treatment of bv consists of oral or intravaginal antibiotics, although these are unable to spontaneously restore normal flora characterized by a high concentration of lactobacilli. the main limitation is the inability to offer a long-term defensive barrier, thus facilitating relapses and  recurrences. this study was undertaken firstly to assess the ability of selected  lactobacilli to in vitro antagonize g. vaginalis to determine an association with a strain able to inhibit e. coli, thus identifying a possible use in av. the second step of the study was to conduct a human pilot trial in women affected by  bv using an association of the most promising and active bacteria. materials and  methods: for this purpose, neutralized supernatants of individual lactobacilli were tested at percentages ranging from 0.5% to 4% to determine their ability to  hinder the growth of g. vaginalis american type culture collection 10231. the bacterium that was able to exert the strongest inhibition was subsequently tested with lactobacillus plantarum lp01 in a human intervention, placebo-controlled, pilot trial involving 34 female subjects (aged between 18 and 50, mean 34.7+/-8.9, no menopausal women) diagnosed with bv. the 2 microorganisms lactobacillus fermentum lf15 (dsm 26955) and l. plantarum lp01 (lmg p-21021) were delivered to the vagina by means of slow-release vaginal tablets, also containing 50 mg of tara gum. the amount of each strain was 400 million live cells per dose. the women were instructed to apply a vaginal tablet once a day for 7 consecutive  nights, followed by 1 tablet every 3 nights for a further 3-week application (acute phase) and, finally, 1 tablet per week to maintain a long-term vaginal colonization against possible recurrences. a clinical examination was performed and the nugent score was quantified for each patient at enrollment (d0), after 28 days (d28), and at the end of the second month of relapse prevention (d56). a statistical comparison was made between d28, or d56, and d0, and between d56 and  d28 to quantify the efficacy against possible recurrences. results: l. fermentum  lf15 showed the strongest in vitro inhibitory activity towards g. vaginalis american type culture collection (atcc) 10231 after both 24 and 48 hours. in the  human trial, the 2 lactobacilli selected, namely l. fermentum lf15 and l. plantarum lp01, significantly reduced the nugent score below the threshold of 7 after 28 days in 22 patients of 24 in the active group (91.7%, p<0.001). eight women (33.3%) recorded a nugent score between 4 and 6, evidence of an intermediate situation, whereas the remaining 14 (58.3%) showed a score <4, therefore suggesting the restoration of physiological vaginal microbiota. at the  end of the second month, only 4 women registered a nugent score >7, definable as  bv (16.7%, p=0.065 compared with d28). in the placebo group, no significant differences were recorded at any time. conclusions: bv, also known as vaginal bacteriosis is the most common cause of vaginal infection in women of childbearing age. furthermore, bv is often asymptomatic as about 50% of women with this condition have no symptoms at all and the prevalence rate in apparently healthy women is around 10%. this study suggests the ability of the 2 strains l.  fermentum lf15 and l. plantarum lp01 to counteract acute gardnerella infections effectively and significantly improve the related uncomfortable symptoms in a very high percentage of women. this could be partially attributed to the presence of tara gum, which is able to create a mechanical barrier against gardnerella on  the surface of vaginal mucosa as a primary mechanism. furthermore, long-term physiological protection seems to be established, thanks to the integration of the 2 lactobacilli into the vaginal microbiota and to their adhesion to the epithelial cells of the mucosa. in the light of the additional in vitro inhibitory activity against e. coli, their prospective use in av could also prove interesting.

TI  == fresh-cut pineapple as a new carrier of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == due to the increasing interest for healthy foods, the feasibility of using fresh-cut fruits to vehicle probiotic microorganisms is arising scientific interest. with this aim, the survival of probiotic lactic acid bacteria, belonging to lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus fermentum species, was monitored on artificially inoculated pineapple pieces throughout storage. the main nutritional, physicochemical, and sensorial parameters of minimally processed pineapples were monitored. finally, probiotic lactobacillus were further investigated for their antagonistic effect against listeria monocytogenes and escherichia coli o157:h7 on pineapple plugs. our results show that at eight days of storage, the concentration of l. plantarum and l. fermentum on pineapples pieces ranged between 7.3 and 6.3 log cfu g(-1), respectively, without affecting  the final quality of the fresh-cut pineapple. the antagonistic assays indicated that l. plantarum was able to inhibit the growth of both pathogens, while l. fermentum was effective only against l. monocytogenes. this study suggests that both l. plantarum and l. fermentum could be successfully applied during processing of fresh-cut pineapples, contributing at the same time to inducing a protective effect against relevant foodborne pathogens.

TI  == assessment of probiotic properties in lactic acid bacteria isolated from wine.
AB  == probiotic properties are highly strain-dependent but rarely studied in enological lactic acid bacteria (lab). in this study, the probiotic features of 11 strains of lactobacillus spp., pediococcus spp., and oenococcus oeni, including saliva and acid resistance, bile tolerance and exopolysaccharides' production, were investigated. the assays included two probiotic reference strains (lactobacillus  plantarum clc 17 and lactobacillus fermentum cect5716). the lactobacillus and pediococcus strains showed high resistance to lysozyme (>80% resistance to 100 mg/l of lysozyme under conditions simulating the in vivo dilution by saliva) and  were capable of surviving at low ph values (ph 1.8) and bile salts, suggesting good adaptation of the wine strains to gastrointestinal conditions. the ability of the strains to adhere to the intestinal mucosa and the inhibition of the adhesion of escherichia coli to human intestinal cells were also evaluated. adhesion levels of enological lab to caco-2 cells varied from 0.37% to 12.2%, depending on the strain. in particular, pediococcus pentosaceus cial-86 showed a  high percentage of adhesion to intestinal cells (>12%), even higher than that shown by the probiotic reference strains, and a high anti-adhesion activity against e. coli cial-153 (>30%), all of which support this wine lab strain as a potential probiotic.

AB  == biofuel fermentation contaminants such as lactobacillus sp. may persist in production facilities by forming recalcitrant biofilms. in this study, biofilm-forming strains of lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus plantarum were isolated and characterized from a dry-grind fuel ethanol plant. a variety of potential biofilm inhibitors were tested, including microbial polysaccharides, commercial enzymes, ferric ammonium citrate, liamocins, phage endolysin, xylitol, and culture supernatants from bacillus sp. a commercial enzyme mixture (novozyme 188) and culture supernatants from bacillus subtilis strains alt3a and rpt-82412 were identified as the most promising biofilm inhibitors. in biofilm flow cells, these inhibitors reduced the density of viable biofilm cells by 0.8-0.9 log cfu/cm(2). unlike b. subtilis strain rpt-82412, b. subtilis strain alt3a and novozyme 188 did not inhibit planktonic growth of lactobacillus sp. maldi-tof mass spectra showed the production of surfactin-like molecules by both b. subtilis strains, and the coproduction of iturin-like molecules by strain rpt-82412.

TI  == quantitative high-resolution melting pcr analysis for monitoring of fermentation  microbiota in sourdough.
AB  == current methods of monitoring the microbial ecology of food fermentation system are generally labor intensive and/or time consuming. this study developed two methods based on high-resolution melting curves (hrm) to monitor sourdough microbiota during fermentation and to investigate the effect of cereal substrate  on microbial ecology. a strain cocktail of lactobacillus fermentum fua3165, lactobacillus plantarum fua3309, lactobacillus paracasei fua3166 and lactobacillus reuteri fua3168 was used to ferment red (town and pan8609) and white (commercial and segaolane) sorghum sourdough, and wheat sourdough. the microbial composition of sourdoughs was determined by plate count and hrm-qpcr to differentiate at the species level. the resistance of each species to sorghum phenolic extract was measured. there was no difference in microbial composition among the four sorghum sourdoughs, with l. fermentum fua3165 in all sourdoughs. the competiveness of the strains in sorghum sourdoughs corresponded to their resistance to sorghum phenolic extract. in a second experiment, five l. reuteri strains, the human-lineage strains fua3400 and 3401 isolated from wheat sourdough, the rodent-lineage strain fua5448 isolated from rye sourdough and the  sorghum isolates fua3168 and 3324, were used to ferment wheat, rye and sorghum sourdoughs. the microbial composition of sourdoughs was determined by plate counts and hrm-qpcr to different l. reuteri strains representing different host-adapted lineages. no difference among different substrates was observed; indicating cereal type had no selective effect on sourdough microbial ecology. in conclusion, hrm-qpcr assays were established as rapid and highly specific tool for monitoring of sourdough microbiota. the ability to distinguish highly similar microbes in samples containing only few genotypes makes hrm-qpcr suitable for quality control in other food fermentation systems. the presence of phenolic compounds in sorghum sourdough favored organisms with higher resistance.

AB  == in the present work, five hundred and sixty-seven isolates of lactic acid bacteria were recovered from raw bee pollen grains. all isolates were screened for their antagonistic activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. neutralized supernatants of 54 lactic acid bacteria (lab) cultures from 216 active isolates inhibited the growth of indicator bacteria. they were phenotypically characterized, based on the fermentation of 39 carbohydrates. using the simple matching coefficient and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages (upgma), seven clusters with other two members were defined at the 79% similarity level. the following species were characterized: lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus acidilactici, pediococcus pentosaceus, and unidentified lactobacilli. phenotypic characteristics of major and minor clusters were also identified. partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene of representative isolates from each cluster was performed, and ten strains were assigned to seven species:  lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus ingluviei, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus acidipiscis and weissella cibaria. the molecular method used failed to determine the exact taxonomic status of bh0900 and ah3133.

TI  == probiotic abilities of riboflavin-overproducing lactobacillus strains: a novel promising application of probiotics.
AB  == the probiotic potential of lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus fermentum strains, capable of overproducing riboflavin, was investigated. the riboflavin production was quantified in co-cultures of lactobacilli and human intestinal epithelial cells, and the riboflavin overproduction ability was confirmed. when milk and yogurt were used as carrier matrices, l. plantarum and l. fermentum strains displayed a significant ability to survive through simulated gastrointestinal transit. adhesion was studied on both biotic and abiotic surfaces. both strains adhered strongly on caco-2 cells, negatively influenced the adhesion of escherichia coli o157:h7, and strongly inhibited the growth of three reference pathogenic microbial strains. resistance to major antibiotics and potential hemolytic activity were assayed. overall, this study reveals that these lactobacillus stains are endowed with promising probiotic properties and thus are candidates for the development of novel functional food which would be both enriched in riboflavin and induce additional health benefits, including a potential in situ riboflavin production, once the microorganisms colonize the host intestine.

TI  == use of sourdough fermentation and mixture of wheat, chickpea, lentil and bean flours for enhancing the nutritional, texture and sensory characteristics of white bread.
AB  == this study aimed at investigating the addition of legume (chickpea, lentil and bean) flours to wheat flour bread. type i sourdough containing legumes or wheat-legume flours were prepared and propagated (back slopped) in laboratory, according to traditional protocols that are routinely used for making typical italian breads. based on kinetic of acidification and culture-dependent data, the wheat-legume sourdough was further characterized and selected for bread making. as determined by rapd-pcr and partial sequencing of 16s rdna gene analyses, lactic acid bacteria in wheat-legume sourdough included lactobacillus plantarum,  lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus fermentum, weissella cibaria, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus coryneformis, lactobacillus rossiae, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus parabuchneri and lactobacillus paraplantarum. two breads containing 15% (w/w) of legume (chickpea, lentil and bean) flours were produced using selected wheat-legume sourdough (wlsb) and traditional wheat sourdough (wsb). compared to wheat yeasted bread (wyb), the level of total free amino acids (faa) was higher in wsb and wlsb. phytase and antioxidant activities were the highest in wlsb. compared to bread wyb, the addition of legume flours decreased the in vitro protein digestibility (ivpd) (wyb versus wsb). however, the dough fermentation with wslb favored an increase of ivpd. according to the levels of carbohydrates, dietary fibers and resistant starch, wsb and wlsb showed lower values of hydrolysis index (hi) compared to wyb. as showed by texture and image analyses and sensory evaluation of breads, a good acceptability was found for wsb and, especially, wlsb breads.

TI  == pathogen exclusion properties of canine probiotics are influenced by the growth media and physical treatments simulating industrial processes.
AB  == aims: manufacturing process used in preparation of probiotic products may alter beneficial properties of probiotics. the effect of different growth media and inactivation methods on the protective properties of canine-originated probiotic  bacteria against adhesion of canine enteropathogens was investigated. methods and results: three established dog probiotics, lactobacillus fermentum vet9a, lactobacillus plantarum vet14a and lactobacillus rhamnosus vet16a, and their mixture were assessed using the dog mucus pathogen exclusion model. the pathogens used were enterococcus canis, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and clostridium perfringens. the effect of growth media, one reflecting laboratory and the other manufacture conditions, and viability (viable and heat inactivated, 80 degrees c per 30 min) on the pathogen exclusion properties of probiotics were  characterized. greater pathogen exclusion percentages were noted for probiotics growing in conditions reflecting manufacture when compared to laboratory (p < 0.05). inactivation of probiotics by heat (80 degrees c per 30 min) increased pathogen exclusion compared with their viable forms (p < 0.05). conclusions: manufacturing process conditions such as growth media, incubation temperature and pretreatment methods may significantly affect the protective properties of the tested strains. significance and impact of the study: growing conditions and pretreatment methods should be carefully considered when designing new probiotics to reduce the risk of common infections in dogs. the studied probiotics are promising potential feed additives for dogs.

AB  == to study the potential probiotic characteristics such as decrease of ph, microbial viability, and tolerance to simulated digestive steps of fermented soy  beverage ("soy yogurt") produced with lactobacilli isolated from cocoa fermentation (lactobacillus fermentum tcuesc01 and lactobacillus plantarum tcuesc02) during fermentation and refrigerated storage. the sensory acceptance of the yogurts was also tested. samples of soy yogurt produced with l. fermentum tcuesc01 or l. plantarum tcuesc02 were collected during fermentation (0, 4, 8, and 12 h) and refrigerated storage (1, 9, 18, and 27 d), and submitted to ph and  bacterial viability determinations. tolerance to simulated digestion steps was done with refrigerated storage samples at 9 degrees c. simulated digestion was performed in 3 successive steps: exposure to pepsin-hcl solution, bile shock, and simulated small intestinal juice. during storage, a decrease in ph and lactobacillus viability was observed. l. fermentum tcuesc01 showed to be more resistant than l. plantarum tcuesc02 to simulated gastrointestinal digestion. all soy yogurts showed acceptable hedonic scores (greater than 5 in a 9-point hedonic scale ranging from "like extremely" to "dislike extremely") in sensory evaluation for flavor, aroma, color, consistency, and overall impression. l. plantarum tcuesc02 and, especially, l. fermentum tcuesc01 showed potential probiotic characteristics when considering ph, cell viability, and tolerance to simulated digestive steps and did not affect the sensory characteristics when supplemented  to soy yogurt during storage.

TI  == yeasts are essential for cocoa bean fermentation.
AB  == cocoa beans (theobroma cacao) are the major raw material for chocolate production and fermentation of the beans is essential for the development of chocolate flavor precursors. in this study, a novel approach was used to determine the role of yeasts in cocoa fermentation and their contribution to chocolate quality. cocoa bean fermentations were conducted with the addition of 200ppm natamycin to  inhibit the growth of yeasts, and the resultant microbial ecology and metabolism, bean chemistry and chocolate quality were compared with those of normal (control) fermentations. the yeasts hanseniaspora guilliermondii, pichia kudriavzevii and kluyveromyces marxianus, the lactic acid bacteria lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus fermentum and the acetic acid bacteria acetobacter pasteurianus and gluconobacter frateurii were the major species found in the control fermentation. in fermentations with the presence of natamycin, the same bacterial species grew  but yeast growth was inhibited. physical and chemical analyses showed that beans  fermented without yeasts had increased shell content, lower production of ethanol, higher alcohols and esters throughout fermentation and lesser presence of pyrazines in the roasted product. quality tests revealed that beans fermented  without yeasts were purplish-violet in color and not fully brown, and chocolate prepared from these beans tasted more acid and lacked characteristic chocolate flavor. beans fermented with yeast growth were fully brown in color and gave chocolate with typical characters which were clearly preferred by sensory panels. our findings demonstrate that yeast growth and activity were essential for cocoa  bean fermentation and the development of chocolate characteristics.

TI  == lactobacillus strains isolated from infant faeces possess potent inhibitory activity against intestinal alpha- and beta-glucosidases suggesting anti-diabetic potential.
AB  == purpose: inhibitors of intestinal alpha-glucosidases are used therapeutically to  treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. bacteria such as actinoplanes sp. naturally produce potent alpha-glucosidase inhibitor compounds, including the most widely available drug acarbose. it is not known whether lactic acid bacteria (lab) colonising the human gut possess inhibitory potential against glucosidases. hence, the study was undertaken to screen labs having inherent alpha- and beta-glucosidase inhibitory potential. methods: this study isolated, screened, identified and extracted lactobacillus strains (lb1-15) from human infant faecal  samples determining their inhibitory activity against intestinal maltase, sucrase, lactase and amylase. lactobacillus reference strains (ref1-7), a gram positive control (ctrl1) and two gram negative controls (ctrl2-3), were also analysed to compare activity. results: faecal isolates were identified by dna sequencing, with the majority identified as unique strains of lactobacillus plantarum. some strains (l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. casei and l. rhamnosus) had potent and broad spectrum inhibitory activities (up to 89%; p < 0.001; 500 mg/ml wet weight) comparable to acarbose (up to 88%; p < 0.001; 30 mg/ml). inhibitory activity was concentration-dependent and was freely available in the supernatant, and was not present in other bacterial genera (bifidobacterium bifidum and escherichia coli or salmonella typhimurium). interestingly, the potency and spectrum of inhibitory activity across strains of a single species (l. plantarum) differed substantially. some lactobacillus extracts had broader spectrum activities than acarbose, effectively inhibiting beta-glucosidase activity (lactase) as well as alpha-glucosidase activities (maltase, sucrase and  amylase). anti-diabetic potential was indicated by the fact that oral gavage with a l. rhamnosus extract (1 g/kg) was able to reduce glucose excursions (area under curve; 22%; p < 0.05) in rats during a carbohydrate challenge (starch; 2 g/kg). conclusion: these results definitively demonstrate that lactobacillus strains present in the human gut have alpha- and beta-glucosidase inhibitory activities and can reduce blood glucose responses in vivo. although the potential use of lab such as lactobacillus as a dietary supplement, medicinal food or biotherapeutic for diabetes is uncertain, such an approach might offer advantages over drug therapies in terms of broader spectrum activities and fewer unpleasant side effects. further characterisation of this bioactivity is warranted, and chronic studies should be undertaken in appropriate animal models or diabetic subjects.

TI  == microbial ecology of sourdough fermentations: diverse or uniform?
AB  == sourdough is a specific and stressful ecosystem inhabited by yeasts and lactic acid bacteria (lab), mainly heterofermentative lactobacilli. on the basis of their inocula, three types of sourdough fermentation processes can be distinguished, namely backslopped ones, those initiated with starter cultures, and those initiated with a starter culture followed by backslopping. typical sourdough lab species are lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus paralimentarius, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus sanfranciscensis. typical sourdough yeast species are candida humilis, kazachstania exigua, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. whereas region specificity is claimed in the case of artisan backslopped sourdoughs, no clear-cut relationship between a typical sourdough and its associated microbiota can be found, as this is dependent on the sampling, isolation, and identification procedures. both simple and very complex consortia  may occur. moreover, a series of intrinsic and extrinsic factors may influence the composition of the sourdough microbiota. for instance, an influence of the flour (type, quality status, etc.) and the process parameters (temperature, ph, dough yield, backslopping practices, etc.) occurs. in this way, the presence of lb. sanfranciscensis during sourdough fermentation depends on specific environmental and technological factors. also, triticum durum seems to select for obligately heterofermentative lab species. finally, there are indications that the sourdough lab are of intestinal origin.

TI  == homo- and heterofermentative lactobacilli differently affect sugarcane-based fuel ethanol fermentation.
AB  == bacterial contamination during industrial yeast fermentation has serious economic consequences for fuel ethanol producers. in addition to deviating carbon away from ethanol formation, bacterial cells and their metabolites often have a detrimental effect on yeast fermentative performance. the bacterial contaminants  are commonly lactic acid bacteria (lab), comprising both homo- and heterofermentative strains. we have studied the effects of these two different types of bacteria upon yeast fermentative performance, particularly in connection with sugarcane-based fuel ethanol fermentation process. homofermentative lactobacillus plantarum was found to be more detrimental to an industrial yeast strain (saccharomyces cerevisiae cat-1), when compared with heterofermentative lactobacillus fermentum, in terms of reduced yeast viability and ethanol formation, presumably due to the higher titres of lactic acid in the growth medium. these effects were only noticed when bacteria and yeast were inoculated in equal cell numbers. however, when simulating industrial fuel ethanol conditions, as conducted in brazil where high yeast cell densities and short fermentation time prevail, the heterofermentative strain was more deleterious than the homofermentative type, causing lower ethanol yield and out competing yeast cells during cell recycle. yeast overproduction of glycerol was noticed only in the presence of the heterofermentative bacterium. since the heterofermentative bacterium was shown to be more deleterious to yeast cells than the homofermentative strain, we believe our findings could stimulate the search for more strain-specific antimicrobial agents to treat bacterial contaminations during industrial ethanol fermentation.

TI  == molecular identification of lactobacillus spp. associated with puba, a brazilian  fermented cassava food.
AB  == puba or carima is a brazilian staple food obtained by spontaneous submerged fermentation of cassava roots. a total of 116 lactobacilli and three cocci isolates from 20 commercial puba samples were recovered on de man, rogosa and sharpe agar (mrs); they were characterized for their antagonistic activity against foodborne pathogens and identified taxonomically by classical and molecular methods. in all samples, lactic acid bacteria were recovered as the dominant microbiota (7.86 +/- 0.41 log10 cfu/g). 16s-23s rrna ardra pattern assigned 116 isolates to the lactobacillus genus, represented by the species lactobacillus fermentum (59 isolates), lactobacillus delbrueckii (18 isolates), lactobacillus casei (9 isolates), lactobacillus reuteri (6 isolates), lactobacillus brevis (3 isolates), lactobacillus gasseri (2 isolates), lactobacillus nagelii (1 isolate), and lactobacillus plantarum group (18 isolates). reca gene-multiplex pcr analysis revealed that l. plantarum group isolates belonged to lactobacillus plantarum (15 isolates) and lactobacillus paraplantarum (3 isolates). genomic diversity was investigated by molecular typing with rep (repetitive sequence)-based pcr using the primer eric2 (enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus). the lactobacillus isolates exhibited genetic heterogeneity and species-specific fingerprint patterns. all the isolates showed antagonistic activity against the foodborne pathogenic bacteria tested. this antibacterial effect was attributed to acid production, except in the cases of three isolates that apparently produced bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances. this study provides the first insight into the genetic diversity of lactobacillus spp. of puba.

TI  == role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature  search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment  of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase  production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in  vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with  s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between  probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.

AB  == background: in the present study, extracts prepared from the leaves of rhus parviflora roxb. (anacardiaceae) were evaluated for their anti-hiv activity, which have been traditionally used for the treatment of neurological disorders such as anxiety, insomnia and epilepsy. methods: aqueous and 50% ethanolic extracts prepared from leaves of the plant were tested for their cytotoxicity and anti-hiv property using reporter gene based assays as well as human peripheral blood lymphocytes (pbls). further these extracts were evaluated for their ability to inhibit hiv-1 reverse transcriptase (rt) and protease activity. safety profile of the extracts was determined on viability of lactobacillus sp., secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by vaginal keratinocytes and transepithelial resistance. results: both aqueous (ic50 = 15 mug/ml) and 50% ethanolic (ic50 = 26 mug/ml) extracts prepared from leaves of r. parviflora showed anti-hiv activity in tzm-bl cells wherein the virus was treated with the extracts prior to infection. further, both the extracts also inhibited virus load in hiv infected cem-gfp cells and human pbls. the anti-hiv activity is mediated through inhibition of hiv-1 protease activity. both the extracts did not disturb the integrity of monolayer formed by intestinal epithelial caco-2 cells. the extracts when tested up to 100 mug/ml did not significantly reduce the viability of l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and l. casei. the extracts (100 mug/ml) did not reveal any cytotoxic effect on vaginal keratinocytes (vk2/e6e7). levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted by vk2/e6e7 cells treated with both the plant extracts were within the non-inflammatory range. conclusions: the studies reported herein showed in vitro anti-hiv activity and preliminary safety profile  of the extracts prepared from the leaves of r. parviflora.

AB  == yakupa is a traditional non-alcoholic cassava beverage produced by brazilian amerindians. in this work the microbial dynamics and metabolites involved in yakupa fermentation were investigated by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and chromatography analysis, respectively. the lactic acid bacteria (lab) population was higher than yeast in the beginning of fermentation  (5 log cfu ml(-1) and 3 log cfu ml(-1), respectively) and after 36 h both population increased reaching 7 log cfu ml(-1), remaining constant until 60 h. culture dependent and independent methods in combination identified the bacteria  lactobacillus fermentum, l. plantarum, weissela cibaria and w. confusa, and yeasts saccharomyces cerevisiae and pichia kudriavzevii. maltose (41.2 g l(-1)),  ethanol (6.5 g l(-1)) and lactic acid (7.8 g l(-1)) were the most abundant compounds identified by high performance liquid chromatography. aldehydes, acids, alcohols and esters were identified by gas chromatography flame ionization detection. by the metabolites and pca analysis we may assign the beverage's flavor to the microbial metabolism. heterolactic lab and s. cerevisiae dominated  the yakupa fermentation, being responsible for the organoleptic characteristics of the final product. this is the first time that the microbial dynamics and physicochemical parameters were investigated in the yakupa beverage and it may contribute to the future selection of starter cultures to perform yakupa fermentations.

TI  == core fluxome and metafluxome of lactic acid bacteria under simulated cocoa pulp fermentation conditions.
AB  == in the present work, simulated cocoa fermentation was investigated at the level of metabolic pathway fluxes (fluxome) of lactic acid bacteria (lab), which are typically found in the microbial consortium known to convert nutrients from the cocoa pulp into organic acids. a comprehensive (13)c labeling approach allowed to quantify carbon fluxes during simulated cocoa fermentation by (i) parallel (13)c  studies with [(13)c6]glucose, [1,2-(13)c2]glucose, and [(13)c6]fructose, respectively, (ii) gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc/ms) analysis of secreted acetate and lactate, (iii) stoichiometric profiling, and (iv) isotopomer modeling for flux calculation. the study of several strains of l. fermentum and l. plantarum revealed major differences in their fluxes. the l. fermentum strains channeled only a small amount (4 to 6%) of fructose into central metabolism, i.e., the phosphoketolase pathway, whereas only l. fermentum ncc 575 used fructose to form mannitol. in contrast, l. plantarum strains exhibited a high glycolytic flux. all strains differed in acetate flux, which originated from fractions of citrate (25 to 80%) and corresponding amounts of glucose and fructose. subsequent, metafluxome studies with consortia of different l. fermentum and l. plantarum strains indicated a dominant (96%) contribution of l.  fermentum ncc 575 to the overall flux in the microbial community, a scenario that was not observed for the other strains. this highlights the idea that individual  lab strains vary in their metabolic contribution to the overall fermentation process and opens up new routes toward streamlined starter cultures. l. fermentum ncc 575 might be one candidate due to its superior performance in flux activity.

TI  == expression of catalase in lactobacillus fermentum and evaluation of its anti-oxidative properties in a dextran sodium sulfate induced mouse colitis model.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria are generally sensitive to hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)). lactobacillus plantarum atcc14431 is one of the few lactic acid bacteria able to  degrade h(2)o(2) through the action of a manganese-dependent catalase (containing the kata gene). however, it is not a natural inhabitant of the intestinal tract and its bio-efficacy and survival in the gastrointestinal tract have never been tested. in this study, we successfully expressed the kata gene from l. plantarum  atcc14431 in l. fermentum i5007 and the recombinant l. fermentum exhibited almost 20-fold higher catalase activity than the empty vector control. the anti-oxidative properties of this catalase-producing l. fermentum were evaluated  using a dextran sodium sulphate (dss) induced colitis mice model. compared with the control, mice receiving dss alone had increased diarrhea and mucosa histological scores (p < 0.05), as well as lipid peroxidation (p < 0.05), myeloperoxidase (p < 0.05), and active nf-kappab in colonic tissue (p < 0.05). similar to vitamin e, treatment with recombinant l. fermentum mitigate these effects accompanied by a improvement in mucosa histological scores in the proximal colon (p < 0.05) and decreased lipid peroxidation (p < 0.05), myeloperoxidase (p < 0.05) and active nf-kappab in colonic tissue (p < 0.05). in  conclusion, the expression of catalase in l. fermentum increased its ability to survive when exposed to aerated environment in vitro and conferred the anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects in the dss induced colitis model.

TI  == hanseniaspora opuntiae, saccharomyces cerevisiae, lactobacillus fermentum, and acetobacter pasteurianus predominate during well-performed malaysian cocoa bean box fermentations, underlining the importance of these microbial species for a successful cocoa bean fermentation process.
AB  == two spontaneous malaysian cocoa bean box fermentations (one farm, two plantation  plots) were investigated. physical parameters, microbial community dynamics, yeast and bacterial species diversity [mainly lactic acid bacteria (lab) and acetic acid bacteria (aab)], and metabolite kinetics were monitored, and chocolates were produced from the respective fermented dry cocoa beans. similar microbial growth and metabolite profiles were obtained for the two fermentations. low concentrations of citric acid were found in the fresh pulp, revealing low acidity of the raw material. the main end-products of the catabolism of the pulp  substrates glucose, fructose, and citric acid by yeasts, lab, and aab were ethanol, lactic acid, acetic acid, and/or mannitol. hanseniaspora opuntiae, lactobacillus fermentum, and acetobacter pasteurianus were the prevalent species  of the two fermentations. saccharomyces cerevisiae, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus pentosus, and acetobacter ghanensis were also found during the mid-phase of the fermentation processes. leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides and acetobacter senegalensis were among the prevailing species during the initial phase of the fermentations. tatumella saanichensis and enterobacter sp. were present in the beginning of the fermentations and they could be responsible for the degradation of citric acid and/or the production of gluconic acid and lactic  acid, respectively. the presence of facultative heterofermentative lab during the fermentations caused a high production of lactic acid. finally, as these fermentations were carried out with high-quality raw material and were characterised by a restricted microbial species diversity, resulting in successfully fermented dry cocoa beans and good chocolates produced thereof, it is likely that the prevailing species h. opuntiae, s. cerevisiae, lb. fermentum,  and a. pasteurianus were responsible for it.

TI  == the effect of growth media and physical treatments on the adhesion properties of  canine probiotics.
AB  == aims: the manufacturing processes have been reported to influence the properties  of probiotics with potential impact on health properties. the aim was to investigate the effect of different growth media and inactivation methods on the  properties of canine-originated probiotic bacteria alone and in combination mixture. methods and results: three established dog probiotics, lactobacillus fermentum vet9a, lactobacillus plantarum vet14a and lactobacillus rhamnosus vet16a, and their combination mixture were evaluated for their adhesion to dog mucus. the effect of different growth media, one reflecting laboratory and the other manufacturing conditions, and inactivation methods (95 degrees c, 80 degrees c and uv irradiation) on the mucus adhesion of the probiotic strains was  characterized. evaluation of dog probiotics was supported by cell visualization using transmission electron microscopy (tem). higher adhesion percentage was reported for probiotic strains growing in laboratory rather than in manufacturing conditions (p < 0.05). inactivation by heat (95 degrees c, 80 degrees c) decreased the adhesion properties when strains were cultivated in soy-based growth media compared with those grown in mrs broth (p < 0.05). tem observations  uncovered differences in cell-surface components in nonviable forms of probiotic  strains as compared with their viable forms. conclusions: manufacturing process conditions such as growth media and pretreatment methods may significantly affect the adhesive ability of the tested strains. significance and impact of the study: growth conditions, growth media, pretreatment methods and different probiotic combinations should be carefully considered for quality control of existing probiotics and for identification of new probiotics for dogs. these may also have an impact on health benefits for the host.

TI  == behavior of lactobacilli isolated from fermented slurry (ben-saalga) in gnotobiotic rats.
AB  == most bacterial strains, which have been studied so far for their probiotic functions, are extensively used by manufacturers in developed countries. in our work, we sought to study a mix (called bsl) comprising three strains belonging to lactobacillus fermentum, l. paraplantarum and l. salivarius, that were isolated from a traditional african pearl millet based fermented slurry. our objective was to study this bsl cocktail in gnotobiotic rats, to evaluate their survival and their behavior in the digestive tract conditions. after a single oral inoculation of germfree rats with bsl, the species established stably in the digestive tract  with the following hierarchy of abundance: l. salivarius> l. plantarum> l. fermentum. bsl cocktail was metabolically active since it produced 50 mm lactate  and it expressed genes involved in binding mechanism in the caecum. furthermore,  the global morphology of the colon epithelium was not disturbed by the bsl cocktail. bsl cocktail did not modify mucus content and host mucus-related genes  (muc1, muc2, muc3 or resistin-like molecule beta). the cocktail of lactobacilli enhanced the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna) at a level comparable to what was observed in conventional rats. pcna was involved in proliferation and dna repair, but the presence of the cocktail did not provoke proliferative events (with ki67 as indicator), so we suppose bsl may help gut preservation. this work  is the first step towards the selection of strains that are derived from traditional fermented food to formulate new probiotic mixture.

TI  == differential effect on cell-mediated immunity in human volunteers after intake of different lactobacilli.
AB  == probiotics are live microorganisms which have beneficial effects on the host when ingested in adequate amounts. probiotic bacteria may stimulate immune effector functions in a strain-specific manner. in this blind placebo-controlled trial, we investigated the effects on the immune system following daily intake of six different strains of lactobacilli or the gram-negative bacterium pseudomonas lundensis for 2 or 5 weeks. blood lymphocyte subsets were quantified by fluorescence activated cell sorter and the expression of activation and memory markers was determined. the bacterial strains were also examined for their capacity to adhere to human intestinal cells and to be phagocytosed by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. intake of lactobacillus plantarum strain 299v increased the expression of the activation marker cd25 (p = 0.01) on cd8(+) t cells and the memory cell marker cd45ro on cd4(+) t cells (p = 0.03), whereas intake of l. paracasei tended to expand the natural killer t (nk t) cell population (p = 0.06). the phagocytic activity of granulocytes was increased following intake of l. plantarum 299v, l. plantarum heal, l. paracasei or l. fermentum. in contrast, ingestion of l. rhamnosus decreased the expression of cd25 and cd45ro significantly within the cd4(+) cell population. the observed immune effects after in-vivo administration of the probiotic bacteria could not be predicted by either their adherence capacity or the in-vitro-induced cytokine  production. the stimulation of cd8(+) t cells and nk t cells suggests that intake of probiotic bacteria may enhance the immune defence against, e.g. viral infections or tumours.

TI  == taxonomic and molecular characterization of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in nunu, a ghanaian fermented milk product.
AB  == produced from raw unpasteurized milk, nunu is a spontaneously fermented yoghurt-like product made in ghana and other parts of west africa. despite the importance of nunu in the diet of many africans, there is currently only limited  information available on the microorganisms associated with nunu processing. with the aim of obtaining a deeper understanding of the process and as a first step towards developing starter cultures with desired technological properties for nunu production, a microbiological characterization of nunu processing in three different towns in the upper east region of ghana, namely bolgatanga, paga and navrongo, was carried out. lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeasts associated with  nunu processing were isolated and identified using a combination of pheno- and genotypic methods including morphological and carbohydrate fermentation tests, (gtg)5-based rep-pcr, multiplex pcr, and 16s and 26s rrna gene sequencing. the lab counts during nunu processing increased from 4.5 +/- 0.4 log cfu/ml at 0 h to 8.7 +/- 1.8 log cfu/ml at 24 h of fermentation while yeasts counts increased from 2.8 +/- 1.2 log cfu/ml at 0 h to 5.8 +/- 0.5 log cfu/ml by the end of fermentation. lactobacillus fermentum was the dominant lab throughout the fermentations with lactobacillus plantarum and leuconostoc mesenteroides playing  prominent roles during the first 6-8 h of fermentation as well. less frequently isolated lab included lactobacillus helveticus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus italicus, weissella confusa and a putatively novel lactococcus spp.  the yeasts involved were identified as candida parapsilosis, candida rugosa, candida tropicalis, galactomyces geotrichum, pichia kudriavzevii and saccharomyces cerevisiae with p. kudriavzevii and s. cerevisiae being the dominant yeast species.

TI  == a description of the lactic acid bacteria microbiota associated with the production of traditional fermented vegetables in vietnam.
AB  == an important part of the daily nourishment in vietnam constitutes of fermented vegetables. bacteria and especially lactic acid bacteria play a central role in the production of many fermented vegetables. the current study was conducted to investigate the diversity of native lactic acid bacteria (lab) populations in 'dua muoi' (mustard and beet fermentation) and 'ca muoi' (eggplant fermentation), three types of popular traditional fermented vegetables of vietnamese origin. to  this end a polyphasic approach combining matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) and phes gene sequence analysis was used. in addition, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was performed as a culture-independent method to complement the observed culturable diversity data. a total of 881 lab isolates were recovered from 21 different samples. predominant lab associated with 'dua muoi' and 'ca muoi' were identified as lactobacillus fermentum (56.6%), lactobacillus pentosus  (24.4%) and lactobacillus plantarum (17.1%). less abundant species were pediococcus pentosaceus (1.0%) and lactobacillus brevis (0.5%). species present less than 0.1% included lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus pantheris and pediococcus acidilactici. in contrast to fermented mustard and beet with the highest prevalence of l. fermentum, the species most recovered from fermented eggplant samples was l. pentosus. in addition, an important degree of genetic variability within the different predominant species was observed and strain dependency correlating with the type of fermented vegetable or location of production could be demonstrated using multivariate statistics. this research gives an extensive and detailed inventory of the lab diversity associated with the production of diverse vietnamese fermented vegetables and demonstrates the influence of type of raw material and/or production location and conditions on this diversity.

TI  == spontaneous cocoa bean fermentation carried out in a novel-design stainless steel tank: influence on the dynamics of microbial populations and physical-chemical properties.
AB  == spontaneous cocoa bean fermentations carried out in a novel-design 40-kg-capacity stainless steel tank (sst) was studied in parallel to traditional brazilian methods of fermentation in wooden boxes (40-kg-capacity wooden boxes (wb1) and 600-kg-capacity wooden boxes (wb2)) using a multiphasic approach that entailed culture-dependent and -independent microbiological analyses of fermenting cocoa bean pulp samples and target metabolite analyses of both cocoa pulp and cotyledons. both microbiological approaches revealed that the dominant species of major physiological roles were the same for fermentations in sst, relative to boxes. these species consisted of saccharomyces cerevisiae and hanseniaspora sp.  in the yeast group; lactobacillus fermentum and l. plantarum in the lactic acid bacteria (lab) group; acetobacter tropicalis belonging to the acetic acid bacteria (aab) group; and bacillus subtilis in the bacillaceae family. a greater  diversity of bacteria and non-saccharomyces yeasts was observed in box fermentations. additionally, a potentially novel aab belonging to the genus asaia was isolated during fermentation in wb1. cluster analysis of the rrna genes-pcr-dgge profiles revealed a more complex picture of the box samples, indicating that bacterial and yeast ecology were fermentation-specific processes  (wooden boxes vs. sst). the profile of carbohydrate consumption and fermentation  products in the pulp and beans showed similar trends during both fermentation processes. however, the yeast-aab-mediated conversion of carbohydrates into ethanol, and subsequent conversion of ethanol into acetic acid, was achieved with greater efficiency in sst, while temperatures were generally higher during fermentation in wooden boxes. with further refinements, the sst model may be useful in designing novel bioreactors for the optimisation of cocoa fermentation  with starter cultures.

TI  == the application of genetics methods to differentiation of three lactobacillus species of human origin.
AB  == in recent decades, the interest in probiotics as diet supplements or drugs has increased. in order to determine a specific bacterial isolate to be probiotic, it is necessary to describe precisely its probiotic characteristics and taxonomic properties, including the strain level. most of the well-known genotyping methods were designed for the commonly-found pathogenic bacteria. the objective of this study is to undertake an attempt at standardization of fish, rapd and pfge methods to genotype and identify the bacteria belonging to lactobacillus fermentum, l. gasseri and l. plantarum species. the fish probes have been designed and tested for lactobacillus fermentum, l. gasseri and l. plantarum species and an endeavor has been made at standardization of rapd and pfge methods for these bacterial species. moreover, the mlst method was applied to differentiate lactobacillus plantarum strains. l. plantarum isolated from humans  could not be genetically diversified with the use of rapd, pfge or mlst methods;  only the strains originating from plants have displayed diversification among themselves and have been different from the strains of human origin.

TI  == the dominant microbial community associated with fermentation of obushera (sorghum and millet beverages) determined by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == obushera includes four fermented cereal beverages from uganda namely: obutoko, enturire, ekitiribita and obuteire, whose microbial diversity has not hitherto been fully investigated. knowledge of the microbial diversity and dynamics in these products is crucial for understanding their safety and development of appropriate starter cultures for controlled industrial processing. culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques including denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and mixed dna sequencing of polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) amplified ribosomal rna genes were used to study the bacteria and  yeast diversity of obushera. the ph dropped from 6.0-4.6 to 3.5-4.0 within 1-2 days for obutoko, enturire and obuteire whereas that of ekitiribita decreased to  4.4 after 4 days. counts of lactic acid bacteria (lab) increased from 5.0 to 11.0 log cfug(-1) and yeasts increased from 3.4 to 7.1 log cfug(-1) while coliform counts decreased from 2.0 to <1 log cfug(-1) during four days of fermentation. lab and yeast isolates were identified by rrna gene sequence analysis. lab isolates included: enterococcus spp., lactobacillus (lb.) plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus (s.) infantarius subsp. infantarius, pediococcus pentosaceus and weisella (w.) confusa. dgge indicated predominance of s. gallolyticus, s. infantarius subsp. infantarius, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, w. confusa, lb. reuteri, fructobacillus spp., l. lactis and l. lactis. yeast isolates included clavispora  lusitaniae, cyberlindnera fabianii, issatchenkia orientalis and saccharomyces cerevisiae. dgge indicated predominance of s. cerevisiae in obutoko, enturire and obuteire and also detected pichia spp. and i. orientalis in obutoko. obushera produced in the laboratory was initially dominated by enterobacteriaceae and later by lactococcus spp. enterobacteriaceae and bacillus spp. were also detected in ekitiribita. development of starters for obushera may require combinations of  lab and s. cerevisiae for obutoko, enturire and obuteire and lab for ekitiribita.

TI  == characteristics of lactic acid bacteria isolates and their inoculating effects on the silage fermentation at high temperature.
AB  == thermotolerant strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) were screened for their suitability for silage making at high temperatures. four selected strains were identified by 16s rrna sequencing analyses and added to unwilted and wilted italian ryegrass for ensiling at 45 degrees c. all four strains (ht1, ht2, ht3 and ht4) grew at 50 degrees c and ph 4.0. strains ht1 and ht2 were identified as  lactobacillus rhamnosus; ht3 and ht4 were identified as lact. fermentum. strains  ht1 and ht2 were the most effective at improving the fermentation quality of italian ryegrass silage, irrespective of wilting, as indicated by lower ph values, less nh(3) -n, and more lactic acid. in contrast, strains ht3, ht4 and a  commercial inoculant consisting of lact. plantarum and pediococcus acidilactici conferred no or reduced benefits. wilting alone did not improve the fermentation  quality of italian ryegrass at 45 degrees c. inoculating with thermotolerant lact. rhamnosus ht1 and ht2 could improve the fermentation quality of silage at high temperatures. lactobacillus rhamnosus ht1 and ht2 can be used as inoculants  for silage making in the tropics and subtropics and could play an important role  in developing silage production in such regions. significance and impact of the study: grasses are often difficult to ensile in the tropics and subtropics because of the high temperatures there. to solve this problem, we screened for thermotolerant lactic acid bacteria and obtained two valuable strains of lactobacillus rhamnosus, ht1 and ht2, which proved to be beneficial to silage fermentation at high temperatures. lactobacillus rhamnosus ht1 and ht2 can be used as inoculants for silage making in the tropics and subtropics, and will play an important role in developing silage production in such regions.

TI  == fermentation by amylolytic lactic acid bacteria and consequences for starch digestibility of plantain, breadfruit, and sweet potato flours.
AB  == the potential of tropical starchy plants such as plantain (musa paradisiaca), breadfruit (artocarpus communis), and sweet potato (ipomoea batatas) for the development of new fermented foods was investigated by exploiting the capacity of some lactic acid bacteria to hydrolyze starch. the amylolytic lactic acid bacteria (alab) lactobacillus plantarum a6 and lactobacillus fermentum ogi e1 were able to change the consistency of thick sticky gelatinized slurries of these starchy fruits and tubers into semiliquid to liquid products. consequently, a decrease in apparent viscosity and an increase in bostwick flow were observed. these changes and the production of maltooligosaccharides confirmed starch hydrolysis. sucrose in sweet potato was not fermented by strain a6 and poorly fermented by strain ogi e1, suggesting possible inhibition of sucrose fermentation. in all 3 starchy plants, rapidly digestible starch (rds) was higher than slowly digestible starch (sds) and resistant starch (rs) represented between 17% and 30% dry matter (dm). the digestibility of plantain was not affected by fermentation, whereas the rds content of breadfruit and sweet potato decreased and the rs content increased after fermentation. practical application: the characteristics resulting from different combinations of gluten free starchy plants (plantain, breadfruit, sweet potato) and amylolytic lactic acid bacteria (alab) offer opportunities to develop new functional fermented beverages, mainly  for breadfruit and sweet potato, after further investigation of their formulation, sensory attributes, nutritional, and prebiotic characteristics.

AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) resistant to erythromycin were isolated from different food samples on selective media. the isolates were identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus lactis, enterococcus casseliflavus, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides. of the total 60 isolates, 88 % harbored the ermb gene. the efflux gene msra was identified in e. faecium, e. durans, e. lactis, e. casseliflavus, p. pentosaceus  and l. fermentum. further analysis of the msra gene by sequencing suggested its homology to msrc. resistance to tetracycline due to the genes tetm, tetw, teto, tetk and tetl, alone or in combination, were identified in lactobacillus species. the tetracycline efflux genes tetk and tetl occurred in p. pentosaceus and enterococcus species. since it appeared that lab had acquired these genes, fermented foods may be a source of antibiotic resistance.

TI  == microbiological and physicochemical characterization of small-scale cocoa fermentations and screening of yeast and bacterial strains to develop a defined starter culture.
AB  == spontaneous cocoa bean fermentations performed under bench- and pilot-scale conditions were studied using an integrated microbiological approach with culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques, as well as analyses of target metabolites from both cocoa pulp and cotyledons. both fermentation ecosystems reached equilibrium through a two-phase process, starting with the simultaneous growth of the yeasts (with saccharomyces cerevisiae as the dominant  species) and lactic acid bacteria (lab) (lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus plantarum were the dominant species), which were gradually replaced by the acetic acid bacteria (aab) (acetobacter tropicalis was the dominant species). in both processes, a sequence of substrate consumption (sucrose, glucose, fructose, and citric acid) and metabolite production kinetics (ethanol,  lactic acid, and acetic acid) similar to that of previous, larger-scale fermentation experiments was observed. the technological potential of yeast, lab, and aab isolates was evaluated using a polyphasic study that included the measurement of stress-tolerant growth and fermentation kinetic parameters in cocoa pulp media. overall, strains l. fermentum ufla chbe8.12 (citric acid fermenting, lactic acid producing, and tolerant to heat, acid, lactic acid, and ethanol), s. cerevisiae ufla chyc7.04 (ethanol producing and tolerant to acid, heat, and ethanol), and acetobacter tropicalis ufla chbe16.01 (ethanol and lactic acid oxidizing, acetic acid producing, and tolerant to acid, heat, acetic acid, and ethanol) were selected to form a cocktail starter culture that should lead to better-controlled and more-reliable cocoa bean fermentation processes.

TI  == comparative meta-analysis of the effect of lactobacillus species on weight gain in humans and animals.
AB  == background: obesity is associated with alteration of the gut microbiota. in order to clarify the effect of lactobacillus-containing probiotics (lcp) on weight we performed a meta-analysis of clinical studies and experimental models. we intended to assess effects by lactobacillus species. methods: a broad search with no date or language restriction was performed. we included randomized controlled  trials (rcts) and comparative clinical studies in humans and animals or experimental models assessing the effect of lactobacillus-containing probiotics on weight. we primarily attempted to extract and use change from baseline values. data were extracted independently by two authors. results were pooled by host and by lactobacillus species and are summarized in a meta-analysis of standardized difference in means (smds). results: we identified and included 17 rcts in humans, 51 studies on farm animals and 14 experimental models. lactobacillus acidophilus administration resulted in significant weight gain in humans and in animals (smd 0.15; 95% confidence intervals 0.05-0.25). results were consistent in humans and animals. lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus ingluviei were associated with weight gain in animals. lactobacillus plantarum was associated with weight loss in animals and lactobacillus gasseri was associated with weight  loss both in obese humans and in animals. conclusions: different lactobacillus species are associated different effects on weight change that are host-specific. further studies are needed to clarify the role of lactobacillus species in the human energy harvest and weight regulation. attention should be drawn to the potential effects of commonly marketed lactobacillus-containing probiotics on weight gain.

TI  == molecular characterization of lactic acid bacteria and in situ amylase expression during traditional fermentation of cereal foods.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria play an important role in traditional fermented foods consumed in different countries. study of their taxonomic structure and diversity is necessary for starter culture selection, improved safety and nutritional enhancement. to achieve these objectives, microbial genomic typing methods were used to study genetic differences of autochthonous bacteria and their distribution in two traditional african fermented cereal foods. a total of 85 predominant bacterial species were isolated from ogi and kunu-zaki obtained from  northern and southern geographical region of nigeria. they were identified using  combination of 16s rrna gene sequencing, multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa) based on rpoa, phes and atpa genes as well as m13-pcr gel fingerprints. the results showed that lactobacillus fermentum was the most frequently isolated species in ogi (71.4%) and kunu-zaki (84.5%). other species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) identified were lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus and pediococcus pentosaceus. non lactic acid bacteria isolated from these foods were species belonging to the bacillus and staphylococcus. non-metric multidimensional scaling (nmds) analysis of the m13-pcr fingerprints for lab strains showed clonal diversity among strains of the same species. in vitro and in situ expression of amylase gene during fermentation by amylolytic l. plantarum ulag11 was detected, indicating the potential usefulness of such species for development of starter cultures and for controlled fermentation processes.

TI  == genotypic characterization and safety assessment of lactic acid bacteria from indigenous african fermented food products.
AB  == background: indigenous fermented food products play an essential role in the diet of millions of africans. lactic acid bacteria (lab) are among the predominant microbial species in african indigenous fermented food products and are used for  different applications in the food and biotechnology industries. numerous studies have described antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of lab from different parts  of the world. however, there is limited information on antimicrobial resistance profiles of lab from africa. the aim of this study was to characterize 33 lab previously isolated from three different african indigenous fermented food products using (gtg)5-based rep-pcr, sequencing of the 16s rrna gene and species-specific pcr techniques for differentiation of closely related species and further evaluate their antibiotic resistance profiles by the broth microdilution method and their haemolytic activity on sheep blood agar plates as  indicators of safety traits among these bacteria. results: using molecular biology based methods and selected phenotypic tests such as catalase reaction, co2 production from glucose, colonies and cells morphology, the isolates were identified as lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus ghanensis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus salivarius, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, pediococcus acidilactici, pediococcus pentosaceus and weissella confusa. the bacteria were susceptible to ampicillin, chloramphenicol,  clindamycin and erythromycin but resistant to vancomycin, kanamycin and streptomycin. variable sensitivity profiles to tetracycline and gentamicin was observed among the isolates with lb. plantarum, lb. salivarius, w. confusa (except strain sk9-5) and lb. fermentum strains being susceptible to tetracycline whereas pediococcus strains and lb. ghanensis strains were resistant. for gentamicin, leuc. pseudomesenteroides, lb. ghanensis and ped. acidilactici strains were resistant to 64 mg/l whereas some w. confusa and lb. plantarum strains had a mic value of 16 mg/l and 32 mg/l respectively. no beta-haemolytic activity was observed, however, alpha-haemolytic activity was observed in 27% (9) of the strains comprising lb. salivarius (6), w. confusa (2) and lb. delbrueckii  (1) isolates. conclusions: the resistance to kanamycin and vancomycin is probably an intrinsic feature since similar observations were reported in the literature for lab. low prevalence of pathogenicity indicator traits were observed among the isolates especially with the presence of poor haemolytic activities and they could therefore be considered as interesting candidates for selection of starter  cultures or probiotics for different applications.

TI  == the in vitro antimicrobial activities of metabolites from lactobacillus strains on candida species implicated in candida vaginitis.
AB  == background: research from developing countries, such as nigeria, on lactobacillus species in the female urogenital tract and their role as a barrier to vaginal infection is limited. therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the clinical biotherapeutic potential of indigenous lactobacillus species. methods: antimicrobial metabolites production were characterised using simple and easily reproducible qualitative and quantitative methods. the in vitro inhibitory effect of lactobacillus antimicrobials on vulvovaginal candidiasis-associated candida species was investigated using modified agar spot and agar well-diffusion methods. results: the maximum levels of lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and diacetyl from 20 vaginal lactobacillus strains from diseased subjects were 1.46 mg/l, 1.36 mmol/l, and 1.72 mg/l respectively. from the 4 healthy subjects, the maximum level of lactic acid was 1.08 mg/l; hydrogen peroxide, 1.36 mmol/l; and diacetyl, 0.86 mg/l. the maximum productions of these substances occurred between 72 and 120 hours of incubation. the in vitro antagonistic activities of vaginal l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. plantarum, l. casei, l. delbrueckii,  and l. jensenii from diseased subjects inhibited a maximum of 5.71% of the 35 candida species tested, while vaginal l. acidophilus and l. plantarum from healthy subjects inhibited between 57.1% and 68.6% of candida species in vitro. conclusion: antimicrobial-producing lactobacilli can be considered as adjunct biotherapeutic candidates for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis.

TI  == functional properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from dairy products.
AB  == twenty-four acid- and bile-tolerant lactobacilli isolates from dairy products were identified and further in vitro characterized for the presence of functional traits potentially useful for probiotic applications, which included desirable and undesirable traits, such as biofilm formation, ability to inhibit intestinal  pathogens, antibiotic susceptibility, and enzyme activity. the majority of examined strains were susceptible to certain antimicrobial agents (streptomycin,  gentamicin, clindamycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, quinupristin-dalfopristin),  except for three strains of lactobacillus rhamnosus with minimal inhibitory concentration levels for streptomycin higher than the microbiological breakpoints (>/=32 mug/ml), which are considered as resistant. undesirable traits such as alpha-chymotrypsin or n-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase activities were not detected, but low beta-glucuronidase, and moderate and high beta-glucosidase activities were recorded in nine strains, which were eliminated from further examination together with three isolates showing unsuitable antibiotic resistance. of the remaining 12 isolates, 4 (lactobacillus fermentum 202, lactobacillus gallinarum 7001, l. rhamnosus 183, and lactobacillus plantarum l2-1) manifested an outstanding potential to inhibit selected intestinal pathogens in an agar spot test, including escherichia coli and salmonella spp., and simultaneously demonstrated strong biofilm-forming capacity. in conclusion, the results of our in vitro experiments showed that the above four strains had a potential probiotic value and met the criteria to be identified as a possible probiotic microorganism, with the necessity of verification through well-designed in vivo experimental, clinical, and technological studies before the strains can be used  as probiotics or as starter probiotic cultures.

TI  == monitoring of the microbial communities involved in the soy sauce manufacturing process by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == soy sauce is a traditional seasoning produced through the fermentation of soybeans and wheat using microbes. in this study, the microbial communities involved in the soy sauce manufacturing process were analyzed by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). the bacterial dgge profile indicated that the bacterial microbes in the koji were weissella cibaria (weissella confusa, weissella kimchii, weissella salipiscis, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus iners, or streptococcus thermophilus), staphylococcus gallinarum (or staphylococcus xylosus), and staphylococcus kloosii. in addition to these bacteria, tetragenococcus halophilus was also detected in the mash during lactic acid fermentation. the fungal dgge profile indicated that the fungal microbes in the koji were not only aspergillus oryzae but also several yeasts. in the mash, zygosaccharomyces rouxii appeared in the early fermentation stage, candida etchellsii (or candida nodaensis) and candida versatilis were detected at the middle fermentation stage, and candida etchellsii was detected at the mature fermentation stage. these results suggest that the microbial communities present during the soy sauce manufacturing process change drastically throughout its production. this is the first report to reveal the microbial communities involved in the soy sauce manufacturing process using a culture-independent method.

TI  == antimicrobial and safety properties of lactobacilli isolated from two cameroonian traditional fermented foods.
AB  == twenty-one lactobacillus isolates from "sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. these isolates were preliminarily identified as lactobacillus plantarum (62%), lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-pcr genomic fingerprinting. twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, proteinase k) and inhibition of other lactobacillus spp. these  bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin g, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. the bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria,  several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the world health organization, as well as multidrug-resistant strains. these include staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare typhi, bacillus cereus, streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella pneumoniae and shigella flexneri. these lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria in traditional fermented yak milk and evaluation of their application in fermented milk products.
AB  == in this study, 53 strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from xueo, a traditional fermented yak milk in the western sichuan plateau of china, were identified and their use in fermented milk was evaluated. all gram-positive and catalase-negative strains were divided into 6 groups at the level of 87% similarity using amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. these groups were  identified as 6 species using 16s rdna sequence analysis and atpa gene analysis.  the dominant lab strains in xueo were enterococcus durans, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus paracasei, accounting for 45.3, 22.6, and 17.0% of isolates, respectively. milk fermented with most of the representative strains was high in quality, exhibiting relatively high viscosity, moderate acidity, good sensory quality, and high counts of viable lab. fermented milk of e. durans sca16 and l. fermentum sca52 achieved the highest scores for overall sensory quality. most strains displayed antimicrobial activity against at least 1 of 9 spoilage microorganisms. lactic acid was the main factor inhibiting the growth of spoilage bacteria, and h(2)o(2) was also inhibitory to some extent. excluding the influence of acid and h(2)o(2), strains sca52 (l. fermentum) and sca7 (lactobacillus plantarum) were antagonistic against some of the indicators, suggesting that the 2 strains may produce a bacteriocin-like substance. therefore, the development of superior strains isolated from xueo to ferment milk with similar flavor and texture to xueo is expected.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == oral and faecal lactobacilli and their expression of mannose-specific adhesins in individuals with and without iga deficiency.
AB  == lactobacilli are present in the intestine and oral cavity of most adults. secretory iga in mucosal secretions may provide carbohydrate receptors for bacterial adhesins. here, oral and faecal samples from 33 iga-deficient individuals and 34 controls were cultured for lactobacilli, which were identified using species-specific pcr or partial 16s rdna sequencing and tested for expression of mannose-specific adhesins. lactobacilli were found in the oral cavity of 76% of iga-deficient and 85% of control individuals. lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus gasseri dominated in both groups. lactobacillus fermentum was less common in iga-deficient individuals than in controls (p=0.0055) and lactobacillus salivarius was less common in symptomatic than in healthy iga-deficient individuals (p=0.0051). faecal samples yielded lactobacilli in most individuals. l. paracasei was most frequent, followed by l. gasseri and lactobacillus plantarum. mannose-specific adhesins were expressed more frequently by oral than by faecal isolates (p=0.032) and oral isolates adhered in higher numbers than faecal isolates (46 vs. 14 bacteria/cell, p=0.0038). faecal isolates from iga-deficient individuals more frequently expressed mannose-specific adhesins than faecal isolates from controls (p=0.039). mannose-specific adhesins  may be a colonisation factor in the oral cavity, and the presence of secretory iga may modify adhesin expression. however, secretory iga seems to have little influence on lactobacillus species distribution.

TI  == structure-function relationships of the antibacterial activity of phenolic acids  and their metabolism by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == aims: to determine structure-function relationships of antibacterial phenolic acids and their metabolites produced by lactic acid bacteria (lab). methods and results: minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 6 hydroxybenzoic and 6 hydroxycinnamic acids were determined with lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus hammesii, escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis as indicator strains. the antibacterial activity of phenolic acids increased at lower ph. a decreasing number of hydroxyl groups enhanced the activity of hydroxybenzoic acids, but had  minor effects on hydroxycinnamic acids. substitution of hydroxyl groups with methoxy groups increased the activity of hydroxybenzoic, but not of hydroxycinnamic, acid. metabolism of chlorogenic, caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, protocatechuic or p-hydroxybenzoic acids by l. plantarum, l. hammesii, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus reuteri was analysed by lc-dad-ms. furthermore, mics of substrates and metabolites were compared. decarboxylated and/or reduced metabolites of phenolic acids had a lower activity than the substrates. strain-specific metabolism of phenolic acids generally corresponded to resistance. conclusions: the influence of lipophilicity on the antibacterial activity of hydroxybenzoic acids is stronger than that of hydroxycinnamic acids.  metabolism of phenolic acids by lab detoxifies phenolic acids. significance and impact of the study: results allow the targeted selection of plant extracts for food preservation, and selection of starter cultures for fermented products.

AB  == ting is a fermented sorghum product of botswana which is used to prepare porridges of different consistencies. this study aimed to characterise ting with  respect to fermentation microbiota and metabolite composition, and to develop starter cultures for ting fermentation. the ph values of 10 ting samples from botswana ranged between 3.5 and 4.0 and cell counts ranged between 1.2x10(8) and  1.2x10(10)cfu/g lactic acid bacteria. yeast cell counts were below 10(5)cfu/g in  all samples and enterobacteriaceae were less than 10 cfu/g. the microbiota of samples consisted of 2-4 dominant strains and strains were identified based on the sequence of their 16s rrna genes as lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus harbinensis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus coryniformis. binary strain combinations were employed as starter cultures to produce ting. major fermentation products were lactate, acetate and ethanol, additionally, 1,2 propanediol and 1,3 propanediol were produced by some strains. all strains were capable of producing ting, which was accompanied by a decrease in ph from 6.3 to  4 within 8h. traditionally processed ting requires 2 to 3 days to attain a ph below 4; the starter cultures thus reduced the fermentation time to 8h.

TI  == effect of grape polyphenols on lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria growth: resistance and metabolism.
AB  == food polyphenols are able to selectively modify the growth of susceptible micro-organisms. this study describes the effect of a flavan-3-ol enriched grape  seed extract (gse) on the growth of several lactic acid bacteria (lab) and bifidobacteria and the ability of the resistant strains to metabolize these compounds. streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus vaginalis strains showed a remarkable sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, including a gse fraction consisting mainly in (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin (gse-m). on the other hand, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus bulgaricus strains reached maximal growth with the gse fractions, including a rich-oligomeric (gse-o) fraction. within bifidobacteria, bifidobacterium lactis bb12 showed the highest sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, whereas bifidobacterium breve 26m2  and bifidobacterium bifidum hdd541 reached maximum growth in presence of gse-o and gse-m fractions. metabolism of flavan-3-ols by lab and bifidobacteria resistant strains was investigated in vitro. the results revealed that only l. plantarum ifpl935 was able to metabolize the polyphenols studied by means of galloyl-esterase, decarboxylase and benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase activities that  led to the formation of gallic acid, pyrogallol and catechol, respectively. an unknown metabolite that does not exhibit a phenolic-acid-type structure was also  detected, which suggests a new enzyme activity in l. plantarum ifpl935 able to degrade flavan-3-ol monomers.

TI  == spontaneous organic cocoa bean box fermentations in brazil are characterized by a restricted species diversity of lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid bacteria.
AB  == spontaneous organic cocoa bean box fermentations were carried out on two different farms in brazil. physical parameters, microbial growth, bacterial species diversity [mainly lactic acid bacteria (lab) and acetic acid bacteria (aab)], and metabolite kinetics were monitored, and chocolates were produced from the fermented dry cocoa beans. the main end-products of the catabolism of the pulp substrates (glucose, fructose, and citric acid) by yeasts, lab, and aab were ethanol, lactic acid, mannitol, and/or acetic acid. lactobacillus fermentum and acetobacter pasteurianus were the predominating bacterial species of the fermentations as revealed through (gtg)(5)-pcr fingerprinting of isolates and pcr-dgge of 16s rrna gene pcr amplicons of dna directly extracted from fermentation samples. fructobacillus pseudoficulneus, lactobacillus plantarum, and acetobacter senegalensis were among the prevailing species during the initial phase of the fermentations. also, three novel lab species were found. this study  emphasized the possible participation of enterobacteriaceae in the cocoa bean fermentation process. tatumella ptyseos and tatumella citrea were the prevailing  enterobacterial species in the beginning of the fermentations as revealed by 16s  rrna gene-pcr-dgge. finally, it turned out that control over a restricted bacterial species diversity during fermentation through an ideal post-harvest handling of the cocoa beans will allow the production of high-quality cocoa and chocolates produced thereof, independent of the fermentation method or farm.

TI  == inhibitory effect of oral lactobacillus against oral pathogens.
AB  == aims: to determine the inhibitory effect of oral lactobacillus against putative oral pathogens. methods and results: total 357 strains comprising 10 species of oral lactobacillus, lactobacillus fermentum (195), lactobacillus salivarius (53), lactobacillus casei (20), lactobacillus gasseri (18), lactobacillus rhamnosus (14), lactobacillus paracasei (12), lactobacillus mucosae (12), lactobacillus oris (12), lactobacillus plantarum (11) and lactobacillus vaginalis (10) were used as producer strains. inhibitory effect against a panel of indicators, periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens, was assessed. most oral lactobacillus was able to inhibit the growth of both periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens. the strongest inhibitory activity was associated with lact. paracasei, lact. plantarum, lact. rhamnosus, lact. casei and lact. salivarius. lactobacillus sd1-sd6, representing the six species with the strong inhibitory effect, inhibited growth of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 in the biofilm model. also, it was demonstrated that growth of strep. mutans was inhibited in a mixture with lact. paracasei sd1. the inhibition was enhanced in acidic condition and 5% glucose. conclusions: the results have shown that oral lactobacillus sd1-sd6 showed a strong inhibitory effect against strep. mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, as well as, gram-negative periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. significance  and impact of the study: the results indicated that lactobacillus may be of benefit as probiotics for the prevention of oral diseases.

TI  == the investigation of probiotic potential of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional mongolian dairy products.
AB  == the aims of this study were to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  (lab) isolated from traditional mongolian dairy products, and to estimate the probiotic potential of the isolated strains. we collected 66 samples of the traditional mongolian dairy products tarag (n = 45), airag (n = 7), aaruul (n = 8), byasulag (n = 1) and eezgii (n = 5), from which 543 lab strains were isolated and identified based on 16s ribosomal dna sequence. the predominant species of those products were lactobacillus (l.) delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, l. helveticus, l. fermentum, l. delbrueckii ssp. lactis and lactococcus lactis ssp.  lactis. however, we could not detect any lab strains from eezgii. all lab isolates were screened for tolerance to low ph and to bile acid, gas production from glucose, and adherence to caco-2 cells. in vitro, we found 10 strains possess probiotic properties, and almost identified them as l. plantarum or l. paracasei subspecies, based on 16s ribosomal dna and carbohydrate fermentation pattern. these strains were differentiated from each other individually by randomly amplified polymorphic dna analysis. additionally, it was notable that 6/10 strains were isolated from camel milk tarag from the dornogovi province.

TI  == effects of two lactobacillus strains on lipid metabolism and intestinal microflora in rats fed a high-cholesterol diet.
AB  == background: the hypocholesterolemic effects of lactic acid bacteria (lab) have now become an area of great interest and controversy for many scientists. in this study, we evaluated the effects of lactobacillus plantarum 9-41-a and lactobacillus fermentum m1-16 on body weight, lipid metabolism and intestinal microflora of rats fed a high-cholesterol diet. methods: forty rats were assigned to four groups and fed either a normal or a high-cholesterol diet. the lab-treated groups received the high-cholesterol diet supplemented with lactobacillus plantarum 9-41-a or lactobacillus fermentum m1-16. the rats were sacrificed after a 6-week feeding period. body weights, visceral organ and fat pad weights, serum and liver cholesterol and lipid levels, and fecal cholesterol  and bile acid concentrations were measured. liver lipid deposition and adipocyte  size were evaluated histologically. results: compared with rats fed a high-cholesterol diet but without lab supplementation, serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides levels were significantly decreased in lab-treated rats (p < 0.05), with no significant change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride levels and liver lipid deposition were significantly decreased in the lab-treated groups (p < 0.05). accordingly, both fecal cholesterol and bile acids levels were significantly increased after lab administration (p < 0.05). intestinal lactobacillus and bifidobacterium colonies were increased while escherichia coli  colonies were decreased in the lab-treated groups. fecal water content was higher in the lab-treated groups. compared with rats fed a high-cholesterol diet, administration of lactobacillus plantarum 9-41-a resulted in decreases in the body weight gain, liver and fat pad weight, and adipocytes size (p < 0.05). conclusions: this study suggests that lab supplementation has hypocholesterolemic effects in rats fed a high-cholesterol diet. the ability to lower serum cholesterol varies among lab strains. our strains might be able to improve the intestinal microbial balance and potentially improve intestinal transit time. although the mechanism is largely unknown, l. plantarum 9-41-a may play a role in fat metabolism.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

TI  == evaluation of probiotic characteristics of newly isolated lactobacillus spp.: immune modulation and longevity.
AB  == in the current study, the probiotic potential of approximately 350 strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from korean infant feces and kimchi was investigated. common probiotic properties of the bacterial strains, such as acid  tolerance, bile tolerance and adhesion to human intestinal epithelial cells (ht-29 cells), were examined. some strains were found to have immune modulatory and antimicrobial properties. antagonistic activity against a panel of pathogenic bacteria was found to be strain dependent. to evaluate the immune modulatory activity of the strains, lymphocyte interferon (ifn)-gamma secretion was determined in conjunction with cell proliferation. some strains of lactobacillus  gasseri, l. fermentum and l. plantarum exhibited increased ifn-gamma levels and lymphocyte proliferation. to evaluate the effects of these immune modulating lactobacilli on host life span, caenorhabditis elegans was used as an in vivo model. nematodes that were supplied heat-killed lactobacilli as a food source exhibited obvious differences in life span compared with those fed escherichia coli op50. the mean life span (determined as mean percent survival) of worms fed  l. plantarum cjlp133 and l. fermentum la12 was 13.89% and 13.69% greater, respectively, than that of control nematodes after 21 days (p=0.036 and 0.043, respectively). in addition, some of safety profiles, including hemolytic type, gelatin hydration and degradation of urea, were found to be positive. these newly identified lactobacilli hold promise for use as probiotic agents, feed additives  and/or in food applications.

TI  == prevalence and impact of single-strain starter cultures of lactic acid bacteria on metabolite formation in sourdough.
AB  == flavour of type ii sourdoughs is influenced by the ingredients, processing conditions, and starter culture composition. it is, however, not fully clear to what extent different sourdough lactic acid bacteria (lab) contribute to flavour. therefore, two types of flour (rye and wheat) and different lab starter culture strains were used to prepare sourdoughs, thereby leaving the yeast microbiota uncontrolled. all lab starter culture strains tested were shown to be prevalent and to acidify the flour/water mixture to ph values between 3.1 and 3.9 after 24h of fermentation. multiple aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, and carboxylic acids were produced by the sourdough-associated microbiota throughout the fermentation period. based on the organoleptic evaluation of breads produced with these sourdoughs, five lab strains were selected to perform prolonged wheat and rye fermentations as to their capacity to result in an acidic (lactobacillus fermentum imdo 130101, lactobacillus plantarum imdo 130201, and lactobacillus crustorum lmg 23699), buttermilk-like (lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471), or fruity flavour (lactobacillus sakei cg1). upon prolonged fermentation, higher metabolite concentrations were produced. for instance, l. sakei cg1 produced the  highest amounts of 3-methyl-1-butanol, which was further converted into 3-methylbutyl acetate. the latter compound resulted in a fruity banana flavour after 48h of fermentation, probably due to yeast interference. rye fermentations  resulted in sourdoughs richer in volatiles than wheat, including 3-methyl-1-butanol, 2-phenylethanol, and ethyl acetate.

TI  == comparison of the bacterial species diversity of spontaneous cocoa bean fermentations carried out at selected farms in ivory coast and brazil.
AB  == to compare the spontaneous cocoa bean fermentation process carried out in different cocoa-producing regions, heap and box (one ivorian farm) and box (two brazilian farms) fermentations were carried out. all fermentations were studied through a multiphasic approach. in general, the temperature inside the fermenting mass increased throughout all fermentations and reached end-values of 42-48 degrees c. the main end-products of pulp carbohydrate catabolism were ethanol, lactic acid, acetic acid, and/or mannitol. in the case of the fermentations on the selected ivorian farm, the species diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and acetic acid bacteria (aab) was restricted. lactobacillus fermentum and leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides were the predominant lab species, due to their ethanol and acid tolerance and citrate consumption. the levels of mannitol, ascribed to growth of l. fermentum, were fermentation-dependent. also, enterobacterial species, such as erwinia soli and pantoea sp., were among the predominating microbiota during the early stages of both heap and box fermentations in ivory coast, which could be responsible for gluconic acid production. consumption of gluconic acid at the initial phases of the ivorian fermentations could be due to yeast growth. a wider microbial species diversity throughout the fermentation process was seen in the case of the box fermentations on the selected brazilian farms, which differed, amongst other factors, regarding pod/bean selection on these farms as compared to fermentations on the selected ivorian farm. this microbiota included lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus durianis, l. fermentum, lactobacillus mali, lactobacillus nagelii, l. pseudomesenteroides, and pediococcus acidilactici, as well as bacillus subtilis that was present at late fermentation, when the temperature inside the fermenting mass reached values higher than 50 degrees c. moreover, aab seemed to dominate the brazilian box fermentations studied, explaining higher acetic acid concentrations in the pulp and the beans. to conclude, it turned out that the species diversity and community dynamics, influenced by local operational practices, in particular pod/bean selection, impact the quality of fermented cocoa beans.

TI  == adherent properties and macrophage activation ability of 3 strains of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) must possess probiotic properties in order to be beneficial to humans and animals. the adherent properties, the acid and bile tolerance as well as the macrophage activation ability of isolated lab strains were investigated in this study. the adhesion was analyzed following heat, acid,  trypsin, and sodium periodate treatments. production of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) by raw 264.7 macrophages was also measured after stimulation with heat-killed lab strains. the viable strains of lactobacillus fermentum af7, l. acidophilus gg5, and l. plantarum bb9 were able to tightly adhere to the intestinal caco-2 cells. in addition, the gg5 strain was not affected by heating, acid, trypsin, or sodium periodate treatment. however, the adhesion of strains af7 and bb9 was reduced significantly by heating and trypsin treatment. this result suggested the gg5 and af7 or bb9 strains had different cell-surface adherent factors. tnf-alpha production by the raw 264.7 macrophages was induced significantly following stimulation with heat-killed lab  at 10(8) cfu/ml in a dose-dependent fashion. in addition, macrophage activity was similar whether the treatment consisted of live probiotics, or probiotics treated with heat, acid, or trypsin. however, the activity was reduced after treating with sonication. these in vitro results showed that the lab studied possess probiotic characteristics, such as acid or bile tolerance, adherent capability, and immune activation, and may suggest that these lab strains retain their probiotic activity as they pass through the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == dynamics and species diversity of communities of lactic acid bacteria and acetic  acid bacteria during spontaneous cocoa bean fermentation in vessels.
AB  == to speed up research on the usefulness and selection of bacterial starter cultures for cocoa bean fermentation, a benchmark cocoa bean fermentation process under natural fermentation conditions was developed successfully. therefore, spontaneous fermentations of cocoa pulp-bean mass in vessels on a 20 kg scale were tried out in triplicate. the community dynamics and kinetics of these fermentations were studied through a multiphasic approach. microbiological analysis revealed a limited bacterial species diversity and targeted community dynamics of both lactic acid bacteria (lab) and acetic acid bacteria (aab) during fermentation, as was the case during cocoa bean fermentations processes carried out in the field. lab isolates belonged to two main (gtg)(5)-pcr clusters, namely lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus fermentum, with fructobacillus pseudofilculneus occurring occasionally; one main (gtg)(5)-pcr cluster, composed  of acetobacter pasteurianus, was found among the aab isolates, besides minor clusters of acetobacter ghanensis and acetobacter senegalensis. 16s rrna-pcr-dgge revealed that l. plantarum and l. fermentum dominated the fermentations from day  two until the end and acetobacter was the only aab species present at the end of  the fermentations. also, species of tatumella and pantoea were detected culture-independently at the beginning of the fermentations. further, it was shown through metabolite target analyses that similar substrate consumption and metabolite production kinetics occurred in the vessels compared to spontaneous cocoa bean fermentation processes. current drawbacks of the vessel fermentations  encompassed an insufficient mixing of the cocoa pulp-bean mass and retarded yeast growth.

TI  == influence of temperature and backslopping time on the microbiota of a type i propagated laboratory wheat sourdough fermentation.
AB  == sourdough fermentation is a cereal fermentation that is characterized by the formation of stable yeast/lactic acid bacteria (lab) associations. it is a unique process among food fermentations in that the lab that mostly dominate these fermentations are heterofermentative. in the present study, four wheat sourdough  fermentations were carried out under different conditions of temperature and backslopping time to determine their effect on the composition of the microbiota  of the final sourdoughs. a substantial effect of temperature was observed. a fermentation with 10 backsloppings (once every 24 h) at 23 degrees c resulted in  a microbiota composed of leuconostoc citreum as the dominant species, whereas fermentations at 30 and 37 degrees c with backslopping every 24 h resulted in ecosystems dominated by lactobacillus fermentum. longer backslopping times (every 48 h at 30 degrees c) resulted in a combination of lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus plantarum. residual maltose remained present in all fermentations,  except those with longer backslopping times, and ornithine was found in almost all fermentations, indicating enhanced sourdough-typical lab activity. the sourdough-typical species lactobacillus sanfranciscensis was not found. finally,  a nonflour origin for this species was hypothesized.

TI  == an in vitro protocol for direct isolation of potential probiotic lactobacilli from raw bovine milk and traditional fermented milks.
AB  == a method for isolating potential probiotic lactobacilli directly from traditional milk-based foods was developed. the novel digestion/enrichment protocol was set up taking care to minimize the protective effect of milk proteins and fats and was validated testing three commercial fermented milks containing well-known probiotic lactobacillus strains. only probiotic bacteria claimed in the label were isolated from two out of three commercial fermented milks. the application of the new protocol to 15 raw milk samples and 6 traditional fermented milk samples made it feasible to isolate 11 potential probiotic lactobacillus strains  belonging to lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus vaginalis species. even though further analyses need to ascertain functional properties of these lactobacilli, the novel protocol set-up  makes it feasible to isolate quickly potential probiotic strains from traditional milk-based foods reducing the amount of time required by traditional procedures that, in addition, do not allow to isolate microorganisms occurring as sub-dominant populations.

TI  == diversity and metabolic impact of intestinal lactobacillus species in healthy adults and the elderly.
AB  == the present study aimed at assessing the counts and species distribution of intestinal lactobacilli and exploring if the data are associated with bmi and blood glucose level in healthy adults and elderly persons. the bmi (p < 0.01), the level of fasting blood glucose (p < 0.001) and the total counts of lactobacilli (p < 0.01 by bacteriology; p < 0.001 by real-time pcr) were higher in the elderly. the number of species in adults was lower (p < 0.05), who were more often colonised with lactobacillus acidophilus (p = 0.031) and l. helveticus (p < 0.001). in contrast, l. plantarum (p = 0.035), l. paracasei (p < 0.001) and  l. reuteri (p = 0.031) were more prevalent in the elderly. l. rhamnosus was detected in adults (p < 0.001), but not in any elderly person. bmi was associated with counts of lactobacilli, adjusted for age and sex (p = 0.008). the higher bmi in both groups of persons was associated with the presence of obligate homofermentative lactobacilli and l. sakei, both adjusted for age and sex. plasma glucose values were positively correlated with bmi and negatively correlated with colonisation with l. paracasei (p = 0.0238) in adults and on the borderline with  l. fermentum (p = 0.052) in the elderly. thus, the species-specific pcr analysis  of lactobacillus sp. combined with viable plating data indicates substantial age-related structural differences in the intestinal lactobacilli communities. the higher counts of intestinal lactobacillus sp. are associated with higher bmi  and blood glucose content, while their specific fermentative groups and species of lactobacilli appear at different glucose levels both in adults and in the elderly.

AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are generally accepted as beneficial to the host and their presence is directly influenced by ingestion of fermented food or probiotics. while the intestinal lactic microbiota is well-described knowledge on its routes of inoculation and competitiveness towards selective pressure shaping  the intestinal microbiota is limited. in this study, lab were isolated from faecal samples of breast feeding mothers living in syria, from faeces of their infants, from breast milk as well as from fermented food, typically consumed in syria. a total of 700 isolates were characterized by genetic fingerprinting with  random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) and identified by comparative 16s rdna sequencing and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) analyses. thirty six different species of lactobacillus, enterococcus, streptococcus, weissella and pediococcus were identified. rapd and maldi-tof-ms patterns allowed comparison of the lactic microbiota on species and strain level. whereas some species were unique for one  source, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus brevis were found in all sources. interestingly, identical rapd genotypes of l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis and p. pentosaceus were found in the faeces of mothers, her milk and in faeces of her babies. diversity of rapd types found in food versus human samples suggests the importance of host factors in colonization and individual host specificity, and support the hypothesis that there is a vertical  transfer of intestinal lab from the mother's gut to her milk and through the milk to the infant's gut.

TI  == diversity and dynamics of bacterial populations during spontaneous sorghum fermentations used to produce ting, a south african food.
AB  == ting is a spontaneously fermented sorghum food that is popular for its sour taste and unique flavour. insight of the microbial diversity and population dynamics during sorghum fermentations is an essential component of the development of starter cultures for commercial production of ting. in this study, bacterial populations associated with spontaneous sorghum fermentations were examined using a culture-independent strategy based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequence analysis of v3-16s rrna gene amplicons, and a culture-dependent strategy using conventional isolation based on culturing followed by 16s rrna and/or phes gene sequence analysis. the entire fermentation process was monitored over a 54 h period and two phases were observed with respect to ph evolution and  microbial succession. the first phase of the process (0-6h) was characterized by  relatively high ph conditions and the presence of enterococcus mundtii, albeit that this species was only detected with the culture-dependent approach. the second phase of the fermentation process (12-54 h) was characterized by increased acidity and the predominance of a broader range of lactic acid bacteria, including lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, weissella cibaria, enterococcus faecalis, and a close relative of lactobacillus curvatus, as well as some members of the enterobacteriaceae family. the lb. curvatus-like species was only detected with pcr-dgge, while the majority of the other species was only detected using the culture-dependent approach. these findings highlighted the fact that a combination of both approaches was essential in revealing the microbial diversity and dynamics during spontaneous sorghum fermentations.

TI  == analysis of bacterial communities of traditional fermented west african cereal foods using culture independent methods.
AB  == in this study, the microbial composition of kunu-zaki and ogi, two popular foods  in nigeria produced after natural, uncontrolled fermentation of cereals, was assessed by culture-independent molecular profiling methods. in particular, pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and construction of 16s rrna gene clone libraries revealed the presence of diverse bacterial communities. dna sequencing of the highly variable v3 region of the 16s rrna genes obtained from pcr-dgge fingerprints identified species related to weissella confusa, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus amylolyticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bacillus spp. and lactococcus lactis spp lactis from food samples obtained from northern and southern geographical locations. a more comprehensive analysis of 272 full-length 16s rrna gene inserts revealed that 70% of them were assigned to the lactobacillaceae family and 19% to the streptococcaceae family. interestingly, sequences associated with a particular food type were also identified. for example, l. plantarum, l. pantheris and l. vaccinostercus were found in ogi but not in kunu-zaki while w. confusa, streptococcus lutetiensis and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus were  found in kunu-zaki but not in ogi. phylotypes corresponding to potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as clostridium perfringens and bacillus cereus were also detected highlighting the need for controlled fermentation processes.

TI  == randomly-amplified microsatellite polymorphism for preliminary typing of lactic acid bacteria from bryndza cheese.
AB  == a high-throughput, medium-discrimination method for preliminary typing and selecting non-identical isolates of lactic acid bacteria in cheeses was developed. ramp, a pcr with one microsatellite-targeted and one random primer, was used for preliminary typing of 1119 isolates of lactic acid bacteria from slovak bryndza cheese. a total of 59 genotypes were identified based on ramp profiles consisting of 12-23 dna fragments of 150-3000 bp. for example, 18, 17, 13 and 7 different ramp-types were identified in lactobacillus brevis, l. plantarum, l. paracasei and l. fermentum, respectively. the method facilitated well reproducible, medium-discrimination typing of lactobacillus spp. and pediococcus spp. at a subspecies level and proved to be suitable for preliminary  typing of lactic acid bacteria isolated from cheese.

TI  == characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  == the study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (lab) from fermented foods in xi'an, china. lab strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of lactobacillus (n = 73), and streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16s rrna gene. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and s. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of lactobacillus. the erm(b) gene was detected from two strains of each of l. fermentum and l. vaginalis, and one strain of each of l. plantarum, l. salivarius, l. acidophilus, l. animalis, and s. thermophilus. the tet genes were  identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. this is the first time, the authors identified tet(s) gene from l. brevis and l. kefiri. the  erm(b) gene from l. fermentum nwl24 and l. salivarius nwl33, and tet(m) gene from l. plantarum nwl22 and l. brevis nwl59 were successfully transferred to enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. it was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in xi'an, china and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.

TI  == intraspecies discrimination of lactobacillus paraplantarum by pcr.
AB  == lactobacillus paraplantarum is a species phenotypically close to lactobacillus plantarum. several pcr methods were evaluated to discriminate l. paraplantarum strains and among them, a pcr using an enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (eric) sequence differentiated l. paraplantarum from other lactobacillus species. in addition, a combination of eric and random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis distinguished among seven strains of l. paraplantarum tested. eric-pcr profiles showed several strain-specific dna fragments in l. paraplantarum, among them, a 2.2-kb eric marker, termed lpf1, found to be specific to strain fba1, which improved the skin integrity in an animal model. the lpf1 encodes three proteins similar to lactobacillus fermentum  aroa, tyra, and arok, which are involved in the shikimate pathway. a primer pair  specific to fba1 based on the internal sequence of lpf1 amplified a 950-bp fba1-specific fragment lpf2. southern blot analysis of dra i-digested genomic dna of l. paraplantarum strains using lpf2 as a probe showed that lpf2 is distinctive of strain fba1 among 16 l. paraplantarum strains. because both eric- and rapd-pcr are fast and technically simple methods, they are useful for the rapid discrimination of l. paraplantarum strains and for the development of new strain-specific dna markers for identifying industrially important strains.

TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

TI  == characterization of lactobacillus from algerian goat's milk based on phenotypic,  16s rdna sequencing and their technological properties.
AB  == nineteen strains of lactobacillus isolated from goat's milk from farms in north-west of algeria were characterized. isolates were identified by phenotypic, physiological and genotypic methods and some of their important technological properties were studied. phenotypic characterization was carried out by studying  physiological, morphological characteristics and carbohydrate fermentation patterns using api 50 chl system. isolates were also characterized by partial 16s rdna sequencing. results obtained with phenotypic methods were correlated with the genotypic characterization and 13 isolates were identified as l. plantarum, two isolates as l. rhamnosus and one isolate as l. fermentum. three isolates identified as l. plantarum by phenotypic characterization were found to be l. pentosus by the genotypic method. a large diversity in technological properties (acid production in skim milk, exopolysaccharide production, aminopeptidase activity, antibacterial activity and antibiotic susceptibility) was observed. based on these results, two strains of l. plantarum (lbms16 and lbms21) and one strain of l. rhamnosus (lbmf25) have been tentatively selected for use as starter cultures in the manufacture of artisanal fermented dairy products in algeria.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria fermentation of human milk oligosaccharide components, human milk oligosaccharides and galactooligosaccharides.
AB  == human milk contains about 7% lactose and 1% human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) consisting of lactose with linked fucose, n-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid. in infant formula, galactooligosaccharides (goss) are added to replace hmos. this study investigated the ability of six strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab), lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus reuteri, streptococcus thermophilus and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris, to digest hmo components, defined hmos, and goss. all strains grew on lactose and glucose. n-acetylglucosamine utilization varied between strains and was maximal in l. plantarum; fucose utilization was low or absent in  all strains. both hetero- and homofermentative lab utilized n-acetylglucosamine via the embden-meyerhof pathway. lactobacillus acidophilus and l. plantarum were  the most versatile in hydrolysing pnp analogues and the only strains releasing mono- and disaccharides from defined hmos. whole cells of all six lab hydrolysed  onp-galactoside and pnp-galactoside indicating beta-galactosidase activity. high  beta-galactosidase activity of l. reuteri, l. fermentum, s. thermophilus and l. mesenteroides subsp. cremoris whole cells correlated to lactose and gos hydrolysis. hydrolysis of lactose and goss by heterologously expressed beta-galactosidases confirmed that lab beta-galactosidases are involved in gos digestion. in summary, the strains of lab used were not capable of utilizing complex hmos but metabolized hmo components and goss.

TI  == isoflavone phytoestrogens in soymilk fermented with beta-glucosidase producing probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == isoflavones significantly contribute to human health and disease prevention, and  exist as glucosides and aglycones. the beta-glucosidase enzyme that hydrolyzes glucosides to aglycones is very sensitive to molecular structure, and thus the profile of the isoflavones can affect their rate of hydrolysis. soymilk was fermented with lactobacillus acidophilus b4496 (la), lactobacillus bulgaricus cfr2028 (lb), lactobacillus casei b1922 (lc), lactobacillus plantarum b4495 (lp)  and lactobacillus fermentum b4655 (lf) for 48 h at 37 degrees c. beta-glucosidase activity was determined using p-nitrophenyl beta-d-glucopyranoside as a substrate and the hydrolysis was carried out in soymilk. during fermentation, maximum growth was seen at 24 h with lb, lc, lp and lf and at 48 h with la. polyphenol content ranged from 12.98 to 17.90 at 24 h and from 12.44 to 15.24 mg/100 ml at 48 h of fermentation. all the lactic acid bacteria produced beta-glucosidase enzyme, which hydrolyzed isoflavone glucosides to aglycones at a significant level (p < 0.05) in the fermented soymilk.

TI  == detection of changes in the cellular composition of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium in the presence of antimicrobial compound(s) of lactobacillus strains using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
AB  == it was previously established that lactobacillus fermentum aca-dc 179, lactobacillus plantarum aca-dc 287 and lactobacillus plantarum aca-dc 2350 exhibit antimicrobial activity against salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. in order to further investigate the killing effect of these microorganisms against salmonella cells, we employed fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ft-ir). salmonella cells were incubated with different concentrated lactobacilli supernatants and their ft-ir spectra were recorded. the second derivative transformation of the original spectra revealed changes in spectral regions corresponding to absorptions of major cellular constituents (e.g. cell wall, cell membrane, and proteins of the cell) among the salmonella cells treated with the supernatants and those treated with the control samples. principal component analysis of the second derivative transformed spectra showed that the yet unidentified antimicrobial compound(s) produced by the lactobacilli tested clearly interfered with the fatty acids of the cell membrane, as well as the polysaccharides of the cell wall in salmonella cells, pointing towards a dual killing mode. our study shed light for the first time in the anti-salmonella activity of the particular lactobacillus strains.

AB  == the composition of cocoa pulp simulation media (psm) was optimized with species-specific strains of lactic acid bacteria (psm-lab) and acetic acid bacteria (psm-aab). also, laboratory fermentations were carried out in psm to investigate growth and metabolite production of strains of lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus fermentum and of acetobacter pasteurianus isolated from ghanaian cocoa bean heap fermentations, in view of the development of a defined starter culture. in a first step, a selection of strains was made out of  a pool of strains of these lab and aab species, obtained from previous studies, based on their fermentation kinetics in psm. also, various concentrations of citric acid in the presence of glucose and/or fructose (psm-lab) and of lactic acid in the presence of ethanol (psm-aab) were tested. these data could explain the competitiveness of particular cocoa-specific strains, namely, l. plantarum 80 (homolactic and acid tolerant), l. fermentum 222 (heterolactic, citric acid fermenting, mannitol producing, and less acid tolerant), and a. pasteurianus 386b (ethanol and lactic acid oxidizing, acetic acid overoxidizing, acid tolerant, and moderately heat tolerant), during the natural cocoa bean fermentation process. for instance, it turned out that the capacity to use citric acid, which was exhibited by l. fermentum 222, is of the utmost importance. also, the formation of mannitol was dependent not only on the lab strain but also on environmental conditions. a mixture of l. plantarum 80, l. fermentum 222, and a. pasteurianus 386b can now be considered a mixed-strain starter culture for better controlled and more reliable cocoa bean fermentation processes.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria community dynamics and metabolite production of rye sourdough fermentations share characteristics of wheat and spelt sourdough fermentations.
AB  == four spontaneous rye sourdough fermentations were performed over a period of ten  days with daily back-slopping. samples taken at all refreshment steps were used for culture-dependent and culture-independent characterization of the microbiota  present. furthermore, an extensive metabolite target analysis was performed through a combination of various chromatographic methods, including liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (lc/ms) and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (gc/ms). spearman's rank correlation coefficients were calculated and a principal component analysis (pca) was performed on the data obtained in this study combined with data obtained previously for wheat and  spelt sourdoughs. in general, the establishment of a stable microbial ecosystem occurred through a three-phase evolution, with mainly lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus fermentum dominating the rye sourdough ecosystems. pca revealed that ornithine and mannitol were positively correlated with rye sourdoughs, contributing to bacterial competitiveness at the onset of sourdough production. wheat and spelt sourdoughs showed a high degree of similarity, although certain compounds (e.g. indolelactic acid) appeared to be specific for spelt sourdoughs.  the production of amino acid metabolites, mainly hydroxy acids (e.g. phenyllactic acid) and alcohols (e.g. 3-methyl-1-butanol), contributed to the equilibration of the redox balance and further enhanced the competitiveness of dominant species in stable sourdoughs.

TI  == phytase activity from lactobacillus spp. in calcium-fortified soymilk.

AB  == this study aimed to identify phenolic acids and flavonoids in the red sorghum variety pan 3860 and to determine changes in their concentrations during fermentation with lactobacilli. sorghum sourdoughs fermented with two binary strain combinations, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus casei or lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus reuteri , were compared to chemically acidified controls. four glycerol esters were tentatively identified, caffeoylglycerol, dicaffeoylglycerol, coumaroyl-caffeoylglycerol, and coumaroyl-feruloylglycerol, that have previously not been detected in sorghum. chemical acidification resulted in hydrolysis of phenolic acid esters and flavonoid glucosides. during lactic fermentation, phenolic acids, phenolic acid esters, and flavonoid glucosides were metabolized. analysis of ferulic acid, caffeic acid, and naringenin-glucoside contents in single-strain cultures of lactobacilli demonstrated that glucosidase, phenolic acid reductase, and phenolic acid decarboxylase activities contributed to polyphenol metabolism. this study demonstrates that microbial fermentation of sorghum affects the content of polyphenols and can influence the nutritional value and antimicrobial activity of sorghum.

AB  == the lactic acid bacterial (lab) community dynamics of two wheat and two spelt sourdough fermentations that were daily back-slopped were monitored during a period of 10 days by hybridizing time-related rna samples, representing the metatranscriptome, to an lab functional gene microarray. to indicate the species  present in each hybridized sample, annotation information for the 2,269 oligonucleotides on the microarray was used. the overall hybridization data revealed that after a transition phase of 5 days, in which atypical sourdough lab species, including enterococcus species, were found, a stabilized ecosystem was established with lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus fermentum as the dominating lab species. compared with the combined outcome of culture-dependent and culture-independent identification techniques, the microarray data revealed a functional role for lactococcus lactis in the early stage ecosystem and the dominance of pediococcus pentosaceus in most of the fermentations, besides l. plantarum and l. fermentum. consequently, metatranscriptome hybridization data obtained using an lab functional gene microarray was shown to be an interesting alternative to microbiological analysis of the community dynamics of complex food ecosystems.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of phenolic acids against commensal, probiotic and pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == phenolic acids (benzoic, phenylacetic and phenylpropionic acids) are the most abundant phenolic structures found in fecal water. as an approach towards the exploration of their action in the gut, this paper reports the antimicrobial activity of thirteen phenolic acids towards escherichia coli, lactobacillus spp., staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. the growth of e. coli atcc 25922 was inhibited by only four of the phenolic acids tested at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml, whereas pathogenic e. coli o157:h7 (cect 5947) was susceptible to ten of them. the genetically manipulated e. coli lpxc/tolc strain was highly susceptible to phenolic acids. the growth of lactobacilli (lactobacillus paraplantarum lch7, lactobacillus plantarum lch17, lactobacillus fermentum lph1, l. fermentum cect 5716, lactobacillus brevis lch23, and lactobacillus coryniformis cect 5711) and pathogens (s. aureus ep167 and c. albicans my1055) was also inhibited by phenolic acids, but to varying extents. only p. aeruginosa pao1 was not susceptible to any of the phenolic compounds tested. structure-activity relationships of phenolic acids and some of their diet precursors [(+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin] were established, based on multivariate analysis of microbial activities. the antimicrobial properties of phenolic acids reported in this paper might be relevant in vivo.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional cachaca fermentations.
AB  == during the production of traditional cachaca (alembic s cachaca), contamination of the fermented must is one of the factors leading to economic losses in the beverage manufacturing industry. the diversity of bacterial populations and the role of these microorganisms during the cachaca production process are still poorly understood in brazil. in our work, the fermentation process was followed in two distilleries located in the state of minas gerais. the objective of this work was to identify the populations of lactic acid bacteria present during cachaca fermentation using physiological and molecular methods. lactic acid bacteria were isolated in high frequencies during all of the fermentative processes, and lactobacillus plantarum and l. casei were the most prevalent species. other lactic acid bacteria were found in minor frequencies, such as l. ferintoshensis, l. fermentum, l. jensenii, l. murinus, lactococcus lactis, enterococcus sp. and weissella confusa. these bacteria could contribute to the increase of volatile acidity levels or to the production of compounds that could  influence the taste and aroma of the beverage.

TI  == intestinal lactobacillus sp. is associated with some cellular and metabolic characteristics of blood in elderly people.
AB  == the higher counts or particular groups (firmicutes/bacteroidetes) of intestinal microbiota are related to host metabolic reactions, supporting a balance of human ecosystem. we further explored whether intestinal lactobacilli were associated with some principal cellular and metabolic markers of blood in 38 healthy >65-year-old persons. the questionnaire, routine clinical and laboratory data of  blood indices as much as the oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-ldl) and baseline diene conjugates in low-density lipoprotein (bdc-ldl) of blood sera were explored. the pcr-based intestinal lactobacillus sp. composition and counts of cultivable lactobacilli (lab) were tested. the facultative heterofermentative lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus paracasei) were the most frequent (89 and 97%, respectively) species found, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus reuteri were present in almost half of the elderly persons. the number of species simultaneously colonizing the individuals ranged from 1 to 7 (median 4). in elderly consuming probiotics the lab counts were significantly higher than in these not consuming (median 7.8, range 4.2-10.8 vs. median 6.3, range 3.3-9.7 log cfu/g; p=0.005), adjusted (or=1.71, ci95 1.04-2.82; p=0.035) for age and body mass index (bmi). the colonization by l. acidophilus was negatively related (r=-0.367, p=0.0275) to l. reuteri, staying significant after adjusting for age, sex and bmi (or=0.16, ci95 0.04-0.73; p=0.018). however, the blood glucose concentration showed a tendency for a negative correlation for colonization with lactobacillus fermentum (r=-0.309, p=0.062) adjusted for bmi (adj. r(2)=0.181; p=0.013) but not for age and sex. the higher white blood cells (wbc) count was positively related (r=0.434, p=0.007) to presence of lactobacillus reuteri adjusted for age, sex and bmi (adj. r(2)=0.193, p=0.027). the lower values of ox-ldl were predicted by higher counts of cultivable lactobacilli adjusted by sex, age and bmi (r = -0.389, p = 0.016; adj. r(2)=0.184 p=0.029). in conclusion, the pilot study of elderly persons shows that the intestinal lactobacilli are tightly associated with wbc count, blood glucose and content of ox-ldl which all serve as risk markers in pathogenesis of inflammation, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease (cvd).

TI  == characterization of a novel lysm domain from lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to display heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the endolysin lyb5, from lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phipyb5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria. sequence analysis revealed that the c terminus of the endolysin lyb5 (ly5c) contained three putative lysin motif (lysm) repeat regions, implying that  ly5c was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. to investigate the potential of ly5c for surface display, green fluorescent protein (gfp) was fused to ly5c at its n or c terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in escherichia coli. after being mixed with various cells in vitro, gfp was successfully displayed on the surfaces of lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus casei, lb. brevis, lb. plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lb. helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus cells. increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated l. lactis and lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for ly5c. moreover, the ph and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of gfp-ly5c, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. all results suggested that ly5c was  a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (lab). to demonstrate the applicability of the ly5c-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) from paenibacillus sp. strain k1, replacing gfp, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of lab cells via ly5c. the success in surface display of gfp and beta-gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in  lab.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria efficiently protect human and animal intestinal epithelial and immune cells from enteric virus infection.
AB  == this study aimed to examine the potential antiviral activity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) using animal and human intestinal and macrophage cell line models  of non tumor origin. to this end, lab strains selected on the basis of previous in vitro trials were co-incubated with cell line monolayers, which were subsequently challenged with rotavirus (rv) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (tgev). in order to elucidate the possible mechanism responsible for the antiviral activity, the induction of reactive oxygen species (ros) release as well as the attachment ability of lab on the cell lines was investigated. various strains were found to exhibit moderate to complete monolayer protection against viral rv or tgev disruption. highest protection effects were recorded with the known probiotics lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactobacillus casei shirota against both rv and tgev, while notable antiviral activity was also attributed to enterococcus faecium pck38, lactobacillus fermentum aca-dc179, lactobacillus pentosus pca227 and lactobacillus plantarum pca236 and pcs22, depending on the cell line and virus combination used. a variable increase (of up to 50%) on the release of no(-) and h(2)o(2) (ros) was obtained when lab strains were co-incubated with the cell lines, but the results were found to be lab strain and cell line specific, apart from a small number of strains which were able to induce strong ros release in more than one cell line. in contrast, the ability of the examined lab strains to attach to the cell line monolayers was lab strain but not cell line specific. highest attachment ability was observed with l. plantarum aca-dc 146, l. paracasei subsp. tolerans aca-dc 4037 and e. faecium pcd71. clear  indications on the nature of the antiviral effect were evident only in the case of the l. casei shirota against tgev and with l. plantarum pca236 against both rv and tgev. in the rest of the cases, each interaction was lab-cell line-virus specific, barring general conclusions. however, it is probable that more than one mechanism is involved in the antiviral effect described here. further investigations are required to elucidate the underlying mode of action and to develop a cell line model as a system for selection of probiotic strains suited for farm animal applications.

TI  == characterization of a cryptic plasmid pd403 from lactobacillus plantarum and construction of shuttle vectors based on its replicon.
AB  == a cryptic plasmid pd403 was isolated from lactobacillus plantarum d403 derived from fermented dairy products. it was 2,791 bp in size with a g+c content of 37%. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed two open reading frames, orf1 and orf2. orf1 (318 amino acids) was identified as a replication protein (repa). orf2 (137  amino acids) shared 31% similarity with the transcriptional regulator of ralstonia pickettii 12d. functional investigation indicated that orf2 (tra) had the ability of improving the transformation efficiency. the origin of replication was predicted, suggesting that pd403 was a rolling-circle-replication (rcr) plasmid. an escherichia coli/lactobacillus shuttle vector pcd4032 was constructed based on the pd403 replicon, and proved to be successfully transformed into various lactobacilli including lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus brevis. the transformation efficiencies were ranged from 1.3 x 10(2) to 7 x 10(4) transformants per microgram dna. furthermore, an expression vector pcd4033 was developed with the promoter of the lactate dehydrogenase from lactobacillus delbrueckii 11842. the green fluorescent protein (gfp) as a reporter was expressed successfully in various lactobacilli tested, suggesting that the expression vector pcd4033 had the potential to be used as a molecular tool for heterologous gene cloning and expression in lactobacilli.

AB  == lafun is a fermented cassava food product consumed in parts of west africa. in the present work the microorganisms (aerobic bacteria (ab), lactic acid bacteria  (lab) and yeasts) associated with the fermentation of lafun under traditional conditions have for the first time been studied using a combination of pheno- and genotypic methods. during lafun fermentation the ab count ranged from 6-7 log(10) cfu/g at the beginning to 9 log(10) cfu/g at the end. similarly, the number of lab increased from 5 log(10) cfu/g to 9 log(10) cfu/g during the process while the yeast load increased from 3 log(10) cfu/g at the onset of the fermentation to 5-6 log(10) cfu/g at the end of the fermentation. a total of 168 isolates (31 ab, 88 lab, and 49 yeasts) were isolated and identified by means of phenotypic tests, pcr-based methods and 16s rrna gene sequencing. the aerobic bacteria were mostly  identified as belonging to the bacillus cereus group (71%). the b. cereus isolates lacked the genetic determinant specific for cereulide producers but harboured several genes encoding the heat-labile toxins hemolysin bl and nonhemolytic enterotoxin as detected by pcr. the other aerobic bacteria isolated  were gram negative and identified as klebsiella pneumoniae and pantoea agglomerans. the dominant lab were identified as lactobacillus fermentum (42% of  lab isolates) followed by lactobacillus plantarum (30%) and weissella confusa (18%). seven isolates remained unidentified and constitute probably a novel lab species. the predominant yeast species associated with lafun fermentation were saccharomyces cerevisiae (22% of yeast isolates), pichia scutulata (20%), kluyveromyces marxianus (18%), hanseniaspora guilliermondii (12%), pichia rhodanensis (8%) and candida glabrata (8%) as well as pichia kudriavzevii, candida tropicalis and trichosporon asahii at lower incidence (<5% each).

TI  == lactobacillus spp. associated with early childhood caries.
AB  == a group of 69 lactobacilli was isolated from caries lesions and root canals of early childhood caries (ecc) affected children treated in the department of pedodontics (children's teaching hospital, brno, czech republic). biochemical and physiological properties of all strains were characterized by api 50 ch kit and conventional tube tests. the rep-pcr fingerprinting with the (gtg)(5) primer was  used for genotypic grouping of the isolates. the (gtg)(5)-pcr fingerprinting grouped all analyzed strains into a few clusters in nearly full agreement with phenotype identification results and clarified the taxonomic position of 13 biochemically unidentified strains. in total, 20 strains of lactobacillus fermentum, 17 l. rhamnosus, 14 l. casei/paracasei, 7 l. gasseri, 7 l. salivarius  and 4 l. plantarum were identified. mixtures of two or even three lactobacillus spp. were isolated from a few root canal content samples. results obtained by biotyping and (gtg)(5)-pcr were generally comparable except for l. gasseri strains that were not biochemically identified. the (gtg)(5)-pcr fingerprinting was shown to be quicker, easier to perform and more reliable than biotyping. our  results imply this molecular method as a good tool for screening and identification of lactobacillus spp. inhabiting dental plaque.

TI  == adaptability of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts to sourdoughs prepared from cereals, pseudocereals and cassava and use of competitive strains as starters.
AB  == the adaptability of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeasts to sourdoughs prepared  from cereals, pseudocereals and cassava was investigated using pcr-dgge and bacteriological culture combined with rrna gene sequence analysis. sourdoughs were prepared either from flours of the cereals wheat, rye, oat, barley, rice, maize, and millet, or from the pseudocereals amaranth, quinoa, and buckwheat, or  from cassava, using a starter consisting of various species of lab and yeasts. doughs were propagated until a stable microbiota was established. the dominant lab and yeast species were lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus paralimentarius, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus pontis, lactobacillus spicheri, issatchenkia orientalis and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the proportion of the species within the microbiota varied. l. paralimentarius dominated in the pseudocereal sourdoughs, l. fermentum, l. plantarum and l. spicheri in the cassava sourdough, and l. fermentum, l. helveticus and l. pontis  in the cereal sourdoughs. s. cerevisiae constituted the dominating yeast, except  for quinoa sourdough, where i. orientalis also reached similar counts, and buckwheat and oat sourdoughs, where no yeasts could be detected. to assess the usefulness of competitive lab and yeasts as starters, the fermentations were repeated using flours from rice, maize, millet and the pseudocereals, and by starting the dough fermentation with selected dominant strains. at the end of fermentation, most of starter strains belonged to the dominating microbiota. for  the rice, millet and quinoa sourdoughs the species composition was similar to that of the prior fermentation, whereas in the other sourdoughs, the composition  differed.

TI  == aflatoxin b1 binding capacity of autochthonous strains of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == some foods are prone to contamination with aflatoxins, with detrimental effect on human health. lactic acid bacteria have been reported to bind aflatoxins and remove them from foods and feeds. reduction of aflatoxin b1 (afb1) from the liquid media by the autochthonous lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus fermentum) isolated from traditional iranian sourdough and dairy products is reported in the current study. the effect of incubation time on the binding capacity of the strains to afb1 was also investigated. duplicates of individual bacteria with population equivalent to 2 x 10(10) cfu/ml were incubated in the presence of afb1 at 37 degrees c for a period of 72 h, and the amounts of unbound afb1 were quantitated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. all the strains were capable of removal of afb1, and the reduction of afb1 ranged from 25 to 61% throughout the incubation period. removal of afb1 was a rapid process, with approximately 61 and 56% of the toxin taken instantly by l. fermentum and l. plantarum, respectively.  binding was of a reversible nature, and some of the bound afb1 was released into  the media by the repeated centrifugation and resuspension of the cell pellets. the stability of the bacteria-toxin complex was strain dependent, and l. casei was a stronger binder of afb1 compared with the other bacteria. no toxin release  was observed after 24 h. these findings tend to suggest that certain novel probiotic bacteria with high aflatoxin binding capacity could be selected for detoxification of foods.

TI  == rep-pcr characterization and biochemical selection of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the delta area of egypt.
AB  == samples of raw milk and traditional dairy products were collected from different  rural areas in the delta region. 170 isolates from these products were identified using repetitive genomic element-pcr (rep-pcr) fingerprinting. the identified isolates were tested for efficiency of biomass production and separation, acidifying activity, autolytic and aminopeptidase properties, antagonistic activities and exopolysaccharide production. the obtained results revealed that the lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus fermentum, enterococcus faecium lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis were the predominant species in egyptian dairy products. two percent of lactococcus, 10% of lactobacillus and 1% of enterococcus isolates showed fast acidifying activity. aminopeptidase and autolytic properties were generally higher for most lactobacillus strains when compared to other strains. among these species, lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei was the highest in aminopeptidase activity and autolytic properties. antagonistic activity was detected in 40% of lactococcus, 70% of lactobacillus and 50% of enterococcus isolates. some isolates produced exopolysaccharides in milk and dairy products.

TI  == enzyme activities of lactic acid bacteria from a pearl millet fermented gruel (ben-saalga) of functional interest in nutrition.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria responsible for the fermentation of a pearl-millet based fermented gruel, ben-saalga, were investigated for enzyme activity in relation with the nutritional characteristics of gruels used as complementary foods for young children. thirty pre-selected lab from a set of 155 isolates were characterized principally for their ability to produce amylase, phytase and alpha-galactosidase. two lactobacillus plantarum strains (4.4 and 6.1) and three  lactobacillus fermentum strains (11.11.2, 3.7, 7.4) able to produce one or more of these enzymes were selected. only weak amylase activity was found in the two lactobacillus plantarum strains. alpha-amylase activity was associated with cells and was lower than 0.05 ceralpha units/ml. phytase activity was detected in all five strains and was linked to the cell. the highest phytase activity was found in lb. plantarum 4.4 and 6.1 (348.7 +/- 17.4u/ml and 276.3 +/- 51.4u/ml, respectively) and lb. fermentum 7.4. (276.3 +/- 13.2u/ml). all strains displayed  a cell-linked alpha-galactosidase activity. in a medium containing 2% glucose, the highest cellular activity was found in lb. fermentum 3.7 (1441.1 +/- 133.7u/ml) and lb. plantarum 4.4 (1223.1 +/- 148.3u/ml) after 6h of fermentation  in the presence of stachyose, and in lb. plantarum 4.4 (763.3 +/- 23.5u/ml) and lb. fermentum 7.4 (346.7 +/- 14.8u/ml) after 24h of fermentation with raffinose.  these results are consistent with previous observations showing that phytates and alpha-galactooligosaccharides decreased during the natural lactic acid fermentation of pearl millet slurries, and that partial starch hydrolysis can be  performed by endogenous microflora provided a pre-gelatinisation step is included in the process.

TI  == use of lactobacillus strains to start cassava fermentations for gari production.
AB  == two lactobacillus strains, lactobacillus plantarum bfe 6710 and lactobacillus fermentum bfe 6620, were used to start cassava fermentations in a pilot study under field production conditions in kenya, to determine their potential to establish themselves as predominant lactobacilli during the fermentation. predominant strains from three fermentations were isolated throughout the 48 h fermentation period. the use of these strains in high numbers clearly resulted in 1 to 2 log higher lactic acid bacteria (lab) counts over the course of the fermentation when compared to the uninoculated control. 178 predominant lab isolates were grouped based on their phenotypic characteristics, and were characterised to strain level by rapd-pcr, followed by pfge strain typing. overall, l. plantarum strains represented the majority of the isolates, followed  by weissella confusa and lactococcus garvieae strains. the results of rapd-pcr and pfge strain typing techniques indicated that l. plantarum bfe 6710 was successful in asserting itself as a predominant strain. in contrast, l. fermentum bfe 6620 failed to establish itself as a predominant organism in the fermentation. the success of the l. plantarum strains to predominate in the cassava fermentation demonstrates the potential for development of lactobacillus  starter cultures to industrialise the gari production process.

TI  == the effect of long-term lactobacilli (lactic acid bacteria) enteral treatment on  the central nervous system of growing rats.
AB  == the aim of this study was to explore the relationship between consumption of large doses of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and the behaviour and brain morphobiochemistry of normal growing rats. four groups of rats were treated with  lab cultures twice daily for 6 months. the control group received 1 ml of saline  per treatment, while two experimental groups received 1 ml of living bacteria (lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus fermentum, respectively) and the remaining group received a heat-treated (inactivated) l. fermentum culture. after 2 and 6 months of treatment, respectively, eight animals from each group were sacrificed, and specimens were taken for further analyses. the behaviour of the rats was evaluated five times in an open-field test at monthly intervals throughout the study. lactobacilli treatment for 2 months induced changes in the  motoric behaviour of the rats. the concentration of the astrocytesoluble and filament glial fibrillary acidic protein (gfap) decreased in the posterior part of the hemispheres, including the thalamus, hippocampus and cortex of the rats treated with l. fermentum. a greater decrease in filament gfap (up to 50%) was shown in the group receiving the live form of l. fermentum. in contrast, the gfap in the live l. plantarum-treated group increased, showing elevated levels of the  soluble and filament forms of gfap in the posterior part of the hemispheres. a 60-66% decrease in the amount of the astrocyte-specific ca-binding protein s-100b was shown in the posterior parts of the hemispheres and in the hindbrain of rats  given lab for 2 months. prolonged feeding with lab for 4 months up to full adulthood led to a further decrease in astrocyte reaction, reflected as an additional decrease in the amount of soluble gfap and locomotor activity in all experimental groups. the changes in filament gfap and s-100b appeared to disappear after prolonged feeding (total of 6 months) with lab. in summary, lab dietary treatment affected the ontogenetic development of the astrocytes, with the highest intensity observed in the early stages of rat development. it can be  postulated that lab treatment may play a preventive role in neurological diseases by decreasing astrocyte reaction and, consequently, lowering locomotor activity.

TI  == effects of initial air removal methods on microorganisms and characteristics of fermented plant beverages.
AB  == the effects of 3 different methods for removing the initial air on the properties of fermented plant beverages produced from phom-nang seaweed (gracilaria fisheri) and wild forest noni (morinda coreia ham.) were investigated. only method m which covered the space above the fermentation liquid with a water filled plastic bag produced no surface film of yeast, had the highest acidity and also antibacterial activity from both plants after 90 days of fermentation. however, the yeast count still exceeded the standard guidelines for plant beverages. the fermented beverage from wild forest noni showed more antibacterial activity against 3 of 4  pathogenic bacteria tested than that from the phomnang seaweed, probably for its  higher levels of acidity and ethanol content. lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from the fermentation samples from days 1-5 using the method m from both fermented plant beverages were leuconostoc mesenteroides supsp. mesenteroides and leu. mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum while presence of lactobacilus plantarum was only recorded at days 4-5 in the wild forest noni beverage. from days 6-14 the isolates were lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus brevis from wild forest noni beverage, whereas only l. brevis was not detected in the seaweed beverage. during days 21-45 both beverages had a similar lab population of l. plantarum and l. brevis while l. coryniformis was only found in the wild forest noni beverage. between days 60-90 in both plant beverages only l. plantarum and lactobacillius sp. were detected.

TI  == isolation and characterization of potential probiotic lactobacilli from pig feces.
AB  == this study examined four lactobacilli isolated from pig feces. two hundred lactic acid bacteria strains were obtained from pig feces using selective culture media  (with vancomycin and bromocresol green; termed lamvab agar). microscopy, the catalase test, gram-staining, and rapd-pcr analysis were used to group the bacteria into 20 related clusters. phenotypic analysis using the api 50 ch test and genotypic analysis of 16s rdna sequences identified these clusters as representing single strains of each of lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus reuteri. bacterial survival under the conditions of low ph (2.0) and high concentration (5.0%, w/v)  of bile salt was much better than that of the reference strain (lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 33199). the isolated bacteria were quite capable of inhibiting the growth of two pathogens, escherichia coli k88 and salmonella typhimurium. the high acid-resistance, bile resistance and antagonism against pathogens, suggest that the four lactic acid bacteria isolated from pig feces could prove useful as  piglet probiotics.

TI  == selection and use of autochthonous mixed starter for lactic acid fermentation of  carrots, french beans or marrows.
AB  == strains of leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum, weissella soli/weissella koreensis, enterococcus faecalis, pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus fermentum were identified from raw carrots, french beans and marrows by partial 16s rrna gene sequence. l. plantarum m1, leuc. mesenteroides c1 and p. pentosaceus f4 were selected based on the rates of growth and acidification in vegetable juice media, and used as the autochthonous mixed starter for the fermentation of carrots, french beans or marrows. an allochthonous starter, consisting of the same species, was also used for fermentation. a two-step fermentation process (1 day at 25 degrees c and 7 days at 15 degrees c) in brine (1% w/v) followed by storage at room temperature in olive oil until 40 days was set up. unstarted vegetables subjected to the same treatments were used as the controls. cell numbers of lactic acid bacteria in the started vegetables were ca. 10,000 (autochthonous starter) and 1000 (allochthonous starter) times higher than unstarted samples throughout the process. when fermented with the autochthonous starter, carrots, french beans or  marrows were characterized by the rapid decrease of ph (<4.5), marked consumption of fermentable carbohydrates, and inhibition of enterobacteriaceae and yeasts. fermentation with the allochthonous starter did not acidify and inhibit bacteria  and yeasts so rapidly. after 40 days, carrots, french beans and marrows fermented with the autochthonous starter had significantly (p<0.05) higher total concentration of vitamin c (ascorbate+dehydroascorbate) with respect to those fermented with the allochthonous starter and, especially unstarted vegetables. the same was found for the indexes of color. firmness of both started vegetables  was higher than unstarted vegetables. sensory analysis differentiated started vegetables. carrots and french beans fermented with the autochthonous starter were, especially, appreciated for fragrance. appearance was the sensory attribute that mainly distinguished marrows fermented with the autochthonous starter.

TI  == in vitro effects of selected synbiotics on the human faecal microbiota composition.
AB  == synbiotics are recognized means of modulating gut microbiota composition and activities. however, whether synbiotics are superior to prebiotics and probiotics alone in moderating the gut microbiota towards a purportedly healthy composition  has not been determined. eight selected synbiotics (short-chain fructooligosaccharides or fructooligosaccharides, each combined with one of four  probiotics, lactobacillus fermentum me-3, lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1, lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2 or bifidobacterium longum 46) were added to 24-h ph-controlled anaerobic faecal batch cultures. the prebiotic and probiotic components were also tested alone to determine their respective role within the synbiotic for modulation of the faecal microbiota. effects upon major groups of the microbiota were evaluated using fish. rifampicin variant probiotic strains were used to assess probiotic levels. synbiotic and prebiotics increased bifidobacteria and the eubacterium rectale-clostridium coccoides group. lower levels of escherichia coli were retrieved with these combinations after 5 and 10  h of fermentation. probiotics alone had little effect upon the groups, however. multivariate analysis revealed that the effect of synbiotics differed from the prebiotics as higher levels of lactobacillus-enterococcus were observed when the  probiotic was stimulated by the prebiotic component. here, the synbiotic approach was more effective than prebiotic or probiotic alone to modulate the gut microbiota.

TI  == bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus strains isolated from poto poto, a congolese  fermented maize product, and genetic fingerprinting of their plantaricin operons.
AB  == thirty one bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus isolates were identified among 135 lactobacilli isolated from the congolese fermented maize product poto poto, during the preparation and from the finished product. using species-specific pcr  and 16s rrna gene sequencing, 28 and 3 isolates were identified as l. plantarum and l. fermentum, respectively. cluster analysis of rapd-pcr fingerprints revealed two main groups (g1 and g2) plus the l. fermentum isolate c4-13. group g1 contained 23 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 74.5%, and could be divided in two subgroups (g1-1, g1-2) each with several branches, plus the l. plantarum isolate c11. group g2 contained 8 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 86%, with two main branches. using pcr amplification with specific  primers, several genes of the plantaricin cluster found in l. plantarum c11 were  identified in the isolates. the number of genes that were detected varied between the strains. the l. fermentum isolate ec11 also contained the plndefg genes. pcr  amplification of dna from isolates with primers directed to the upstream and downstream region of the plantaricin cluster generated an amplicon identical to that obtained with dna from the control strain l. plantarum wcfs1. amplification  products from the positive strains were used for restriction analysis with hindiii, ecori and kpni in separate reactions. cluster analysis of restriction profiles revealed high similarities for ecori and hindii digest profiles, and an  identical profile for all kpni digests. the l. fermentum ec11 isolate clustered with l. plantarum strains in a group with a high correlation coefficient. the results suggest a low degree of diversity in the plantarincin gene cluster. however, other strains that tested positive for individual plantaricin genes may  present great heterogeneity in the plantaricin operons. because of their broad spectra of inhibition (including escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, enterobacter aerogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and enterococcus faecalis), isolates from the present study could  be used to improve the safety and storage stability of poto poto.

TI  == long-term colonization of a lactobacillus plantarum synbiotic preparation in the  neonatal gut.
AB  == background: probiotic, prebiotic, and synbiotic (a combination of pro- and prebiotic) supplements increasingly are being used to prevent and treat a variety of health conditions. although colonization is considered a key element in the success of such treatments, few clinical studies have addressed colonizing ability. studies are even more limited in neonates and infants, who may benefit most from such treatment. the present study was conducted to determine the colonizing ability, tolerance, and impact on the stool flora of 7 days of administration of a synbiotic supplement to a neonatal cohort, in preparation for a larger hospital-based trial. patients and methods: in this randomized, double-masked, controlled trial, healthy inborn newborns >35 weeks of gestational age and >1800 g birth weight were randomized between 1 and 3 days after birth to  receive an oral synbiotic preparation (lactobacillus plantarum and fructooligosaccharides) or a dextrose saline placebo. two babies were treated with the synbiotic preparation for every 1 baby treated with the placebo. duration of therapy was 7 days. comprehensive stool cultures were done at baseline and on days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28. results: nineteen infants received the active study supplement and 12 infants received the placebo for 7 days. l plantarum was cultured from the stools of 84% of the treated infants after 3 days of treatment, and from 95% of infants on day 28 after birth. of the infants, 100%, 94%, 88%, 56%, and 32% remained colonized at months 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively. in both groups, the total mean number of species and the mean log colony counts increased over time. the number of bacterial species was significantly higher on days 21 and 28 in the synbiotic preparation group compared with placebo (p = 0.002 and 0.03, respectively). there was a linear increase in the mean log gram-negative colony counts in the placebo group during  the 4-week period that was significantly higher than that in the lactobacillus group on days 14, 21, and 28 (p < 0.001 for each). in contrast, the supplement group had significantly higher gram-positive colony counts on days 14 (p = 0.002) and 28 (p = 0.04). only 1 infant in the placebo group was colonized with l fermentum during the first 28 days of life. no difference was found in the percent increase in weight between baseline and day 7, but on day 28 and months 2, 3, and 6, the percent increase from baseline was higher in the probiotic-treated group (p </= 0.05). the supplement was tolerated well. conclusions: the synbiotic preparation colonized quickly after 3 days of administration and the infants stayed colonized for several months after therapy  was stopped. there was an increase in bacterial diversity and gram-positive organisms and a reduction of gram-negative bacterial load in the treatment group. because a combination preparation was used, it is difficult to specifically attribute the colonization to either the probiotic or prebiotic component in this study. larger efficacy trials are warranted to examine the mechanism of action and precise effects of these supplements.

TI  == microflora of feta cheese from four greek manufacturers.
AB  == the components of the microflora of four feta cheeses, produced by different greek manufacturers, were determined by culture dependent and independent techniques. isolates from microbiological media were first grouped by polymerase  chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) and then representatives of each dgge group were sequenced for identification purposes. dna and rna, extracted directly from the cheese, were subjected to pcr-dgge. moreover, feta cheeses were subjected to fish analysis in order to identify viable bacterial populations. the microbial ecology, as represented by the lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeast populations, was different for the four cheeses. the main lab species isolated were lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus coryniformis and lactobacillus fermentum. however, some inconsistencies were observed between the results obtained with the culture dependent and the culture independent approach. in the case of the yeasts, the results obtained by pcr-dgge compared very well with those obtained by the conventional microbiological analysis and the main species found were kluyveromyces lactis, pichia fermentans and c. zeylanoides. fish analysis highlighted viable but not culturable populations of streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus spp. rapd-pcr performed on the l. plantarum isolates revealed a cheese specific distribution and a temperature dependent clustering.

TI  == functional properties of selected starter cultures for sour maize bread.
AB  == this paper focuses on the functional properties of maize sour-dough microflora selected and tested for their use as starter cultures for sour maize bread. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolated from spontaneously fermented maize dough were selected based on dominance during fermentation and presence at the end of fermentation. functional properties examined included acidification, leavening and production of some antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting matrix. the organisms previously identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. fermentum, lb. acidophilus, pediococcus acidilactici, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc dextranicum and saccharomyces cerevisiae were used singly and as  mixed cultures in the fermentation (fermentation time: 12h at 28+/-2 degrees c) of maize meal (particle size >0.2mm). the ph fell from an initial value of 5.62-3.05 in maize meals fermented with lb. plantarum; 4.37 in l. dextranicum+s.  cerevisiae compared with the value for the control (no starter) of 4.54. significant differences (p <or =0.05) were observed in values obtained for the functional properties tested when starters were inoculated compared with the control (no starter) except for leavening. bivariate correlations at 0.01 levels  (two-tailed) showed that significant correlations existed among ph and production of antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting meals, the highest correlation being between production of diacetyl and acid (0.694), a positive correlation indicating that production of both antimicrobial compounds increase together with time. antimicrobial activities of the fermented maize dough were confirmed by their abilities to inhibit the growth of salmonella typhi, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and aspergillus flavus from an initial inoculum concentration of 7 log cfu ml(-1)) for test bacteria and zone of inhibition of up to 1.33 cm for aflatoxigenic a. flavus. the findings of this study form a database for further studies on the development of starter cultures for sour maize bread production as an alternative bread specialty.

AB  == the genome of lactobacillus salivarius ucc118 comprises a 1.83-mb chromosome, a 242-kb megaplasmid (pmp118), and two smaller plasmids of 20 kb (psf118-20) and 44 kb (psf118-44). annotation and bioinformatic analyses suggest that both of the smaller plasmids replicate by a theta replication mechanism. furthermore, it appears that they are transmissible, although neither possesses a complete set of conjugation genes. plasmid psf118-20 encodes a toxin-antitoxin system composed of pemi and pemk homologs, and this plasmid could be cured when pemi was produced in trans. the minimal replicon of psf118-20 was determined by deletion analysis. shuttle vector derivatives of psf118-20 were generated that included the replication region (pls203) and the replication region plus mobilization genes (pls208). the plasmid pls203 was stably maintained without selection in lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, and the psf118-20-cured derivative strain of l. salivarius ucc118 (strain ls201). cloning in pls203 of genes encoding luciferase and green fluorescent protein, and expression from a constitutive l. salivarius promoter, demonstrated the utility of this vector for  the expression of heterologous genes in lactobacillus. this study thus expands the knowledge base and vector repertoire of probiotic lactobacilli.

TI  == diversity and dynamics of lactobacilli populations during ripening of rdo camembert cheese.
AB  == the diversity and dynamics of lactobacillus populations in traditional raw milk camembert cheese were monitored throughout the manufacturing process in 3 dairies. culture-dependent analysis was carried out on isolates grown on acidified de man - rogosa - sharpe agar and lactobacillus anaerobic de man rogosa sharpe agar supplemented with vancomycin and bromocresol green media. the isolates were identified by polymerase chain reaction - temperature gradient gel  electrophoresis (pcr-tgge) and (or) species-specific pcr and (or) sequencing, and lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus plantarum isolates were characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). milk and cheese were subjected to culture-independent analysis by pcr-tgge. presumed lactobacilli were detected by  plate counts throughout the ripening process. however, molecular analysis of total dna and dna of isolates failed to detect lactobacillus spp. in certain cases. the dominant species in the 3 dairies was l. paracasei. pfge analysis revealed 21 different profiles among 39 l. paracasei isolates. lactobacillus plantarum was the second most isolated species, but it occurred nearly exclusively in one dairy. the other species isolated were lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, a lactobacillus psittaci/delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus/gallinarum/crispatus group, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus kefiri, and lactobacillus perolens. lactobacilli diversity  at the strain level was high. dynamics varied among dairies, and each cheese exhibited a specific picture of species and strains.

TI  == screening of lactic acid bacteria from vacuum packaged beef for antimicrobial activity.
AB  == the objective of this study was to isolate lactic acid bacteria (lab) from vacuum packaged beef and to investigate their antagonist activity. lab mean counts of 5.19 log cfu/cm(2) were obtained from five samples of vacuum packaged beef. two hundred isolates were selected and screened for the inhibitory effect on five atcc reference lactobacillus strains. thirty six isolates showed activity in the  agar spot test against at least two of the indicator strains. however, only six cell free supernatants (cfs) from these isolates exhibited activity against the indicator strains using the well-diffusion test and conditions that eliminated the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide. l. acidophilus was the most sensitive indicator tested, whereas l. plantarum and l. fermentum were the most resistant ones. identification by midi system indicated that these lab isolates were lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, pediococcus acidilactici, lactobacillus  delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and lactobacillus casei gc subgroup a. the antagonistic factors produced by most of these lab against l. acidophilus were resistant to heat treatment (100 degrees c for 10 min) and stable over a wide ph  range (4.0 to 9.0). these data suggest that these isolates could be used as promising hurdles aiming increased safety and extended shelf life of meat products.

TI  == chlorine dioxide against bacteria and yeasts from the alcoholic fermentation.
AB  == the ethanol production in brazil is carried out by fed-batch or continuous process with cell recycle, in such way that bacterial contaminants are also recycled and may be troublesome due to the substrate competition. addition of sulphuric acid when inoculum cells are washed can control the bacterial growth or alternatively biocides are used. this work aimed to verify the effect of chlorine dioxide, a well-known biocide for bacterial decontamination of water and equipments, against contaminant bacteria (bacillus subtilis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum and leuconostoc mesenteroides) from alcoholic  fermentation, through the method of minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), as well as its effect on the industrial yeast inoculum. lower mic was found for b. subtilis (10 ppm) and leuconostoc mesenteroides (50 ppm) than for lactobacillus fermentum (75 ppm) and lactobacillus plantarum (125 ppm). additionally, these concentrations of chlorine dioxide had similar effects on bacteria as 3 ppm of kamoran(r) (recommended dosage for fermentation tanks), exception for b. subtilis, which could not be controlled at this kamoran(r) dosage. the growth of  industrial yeasts was affected when the concentration of chlorine dioxide was higher than 50 ppm, but the effect was slightly dependent on the type of yeast strain. smooth yeast colonies (dispersed cells) seemed to be more sensitive than  wrinkled yeast colonies (clustered cells/pseudohyphal growth), both isolated from an alcohol-producing unit during the 2006/2007 sugar cane harvest. the main advantage in the usage of chlorine dioxide that it can replace antibiotics, avoiding the selection of resistant populations of microorganisms.

AB  == the survival rate of five freeze-dried bacteria species, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus pentosus, weisella paramesenteroides, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and lactobacillus fermentum, was described in terms of reaction rate constants (d or k) and temperature sensitivity of rate constants (z or ea). the freeze-dried strains were stored under vacuum at 55, 37, and 4 degrees c for 168 h, 17 days, and 2 months, respectively. d-values decreased and k increased with an increase of the storage temperature. neither the z-value nor the inactivation energy (ea)  of the reaction was significantly different (p > 0.05) for all the strains, suggesting that thermal inactivation of the freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria may occur by the same mechanism. therefore, it was possible to compare rate constants of survival for the freeze-dried strains studied.

TI  == diversity of predominant lactic acid bacteria associated with cocoa fermentation  in nigeria.
AB  == the fermentation of cocoa relies on a complex succession of bacteria and filamentous fungi, all of which can have an impact on cocoa flavor. so far, few investigations have focused on the diversity of lactic acid bacteria involved in  cocoa fermentation, and many earlier investigations did not rely on polyphasic taxonomical approaches, which take both phenotypic and genotypic characterization techniques into account. in our study, we characterized predominant lactic acid bacteria from cocoa fermentations in nigeria, using a combination of phenotypic tests, repetitive extragenic palindromic pcr, and sequencing of the 16s rrna gene of representative strains for accurate species identification. thus, of a total of 193 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains isolated from common media used to cultivate lab, 40 (20.7%) were heterofermentative and consisted of either l. brevis or l. fermentum strains. the majority of the isolates were homofermentative rods (110 strains; 57% of isolates) which were characterized as  l. plantarum strains. the homofermentative cocci consisted predominantly of 35 (18.1% of isolates) pediococcus acidilactici strains. thus, the lab populations derived from these media in this study were accurately described. this can contribute to the further assessment of the effect of common lab strains on the flavor characteristics of fermenting cocoa in further studies.

TI  == effect of proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole on growth and morphology of oral lactobacillus strains.
AB  == objectives: proton pump inhibitors (ppi) used to suppress acid secretion in the stomach are among the most widely prescribed medications. there is emerging evidence of proton secretion elsewhere in the aerodigestive tract, and acidic microenvironments are integral to oral flora such as lactobacillus. the hypothesis of this study is that the growth rate and morphology of oral lactobacillus strains are effected by ppis. methods: nineteen different strains of lactobacilli were inoculated in microtiter plates at ph of 4.5 to 6.5 and exposed to twofold dilutions of pantoprazole at a range of 2.5 mg/ml to 2.5 microg/ml. bacterial growth was monitored, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the drug was determined for the strains most sensitive to  pantoprazole. results: in the unexposed (control) group, nine lactobacilli strains were affected by ph changes from 6.5 to 4.5. in the group exposed to pantoprazole, 9 of the 19 lactobacilli strains were found to have an mic below 625 microg/ml, with l. plantarum 14917 being the most sensitive (mic = 20 microg/ml). in some strains, such as l. s. salivarius 11741, gram-staining revealed conformational changes in the bacteria when grown in the presence of pantoprazole. conclusion: growth rates and morphology of oral lactobacillus are affected by the ph of the environment. pantoprazole at supraphysiologic doses further affects growth rates and conformation in some strains. significance: the  balance of oral flora and upper digestive tract homeostasis may be affected by unexpected targets of ppi pharmacotherapy, with possible unanticipated consequences.

TI  == fermentation of calcium-fortified soymilk with lactobacillus: effects on calcium  solubility, isoflavone conversion, and production of organic acids.
AB  == the objective of this study was to enhance calcium solubility and bioavailability from calcium-fortified soymilk by fermentation with 7 strains of lactobacillus, namely, l. acidophilus atcc 4962, atcc33200, atcc 4356, atcc 4461, l. casei ascc  290, l. plantarum ascc 276, and l. fermentum vri-003. the parameters that were used are viability, ph, calcium solubility, organic acid, and biologically active isoflavone aglycone content. calcium-fortified soymilk made from soy protein isolate was inoculated with these probiotic strains, incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees c, then stored for 14 d at 4 degrees c. soluble calcium was measured using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (aa). organic acids and bioactive isoflavone aglycones, including diadzein, genistein, and glycetein, were measured using hplc. viability of the strains in the fermented calcium-fortified soymilk was > 8.5 log(10) cfu/g after 24 h fermentation and this was maintained for 14-d  storage at 4 degrees c. after 24 h, there was a significant increase (p < 0.05) in soluble calcium. l. acidophilus atcc 4962 and l. casei ascc 290 demonstrated the highest increase with 89.3% and 87.0% soluble calcium after 24 h, respectively. the increase in calcium solubility observed was related to lowered  ph associated with production of lactic and acetic acids. fermentation significantly increased (p < 0.05) the level of conversion of isoflavones into biologically active aglycones, including diadzein, genistein, and glycetein. our  results show that fermenting calcium-fortified soymilk with the selected probiotics can potentially enhance the calcium bioavailability of calcium-fortified soymilk due to increased calcium solubility and bioactive isoflavone aglycone enrichment.

TI  == nonstarter lactobacillus strains as adjunct cultures for cheese making: in vitro  characterization and performance in two model cheeses.
AB  == nonstarter lactic acid bacteria are the main uncontrolled factor in today's industrial cheese making and may be the cause of quality inconsistencies and defects in cheeses. in this context, adjunct cultures of selected lactobacilli from nonstarter lactic acid bacteria origin appear as the best alternative to indirectly control cheese biota. the objective of the present work was to study the technological properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from cheese by in  vitro and in situ assays. milk acidification kinetics and proteolytic and acidifying activities were assessed, and peptide mapping of trichloroacetic acid  8% soluble fraction of milk cultures was performed by liquid chromatography. in addition, the tolerance to salts (nacl and kcl) and the phage-resistance were investigated. four strains were selected for testing as adjunct cultures in cheese making experiments at pilot plant scale. in in vitro assays, most strains  acidified milk slowly and showed weak to moderate proteolytic activity. fast strains decreased milk ph to 4.5 in 8 h, and continued acidification to 3.5 in 12 h or more. this group consisted mostly of lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus rhamnosus strains. approximately one-third of the slow strains, which comprised mainly lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus curvatus, were capable to grow when milk was supplemented with glucose and casein hydrolysate. peptide maps were similar to those of lactic acid bacteria considered to have a moderate proteolytic activity. most strains showed  salt tolerance and resistance to specific phages. the lactobacillus strains selected as adjunct cultures for cheese making experiments reached 10(8) cfu/g in soft cheeses at 7 d of ripening, whereas they reached 10(9) cfu/g in semihard cheeses after 15 d of ripening. in both cheese varieties, the adjunct culture population remained at high counts during all ripening, in some cases overcoming  or equaling primary starter. overall, proximate composition of cheeses with and without added lactobacilli did not differ; however, some of the tested strains continued acidifying during ripening, which was mainly noticed in soft cheeses and affected overall quality of the products. the lactobacilli strains with low acidifying activity showed appropriate technological characteristics for their use as adjunct cultures in soft and semihard cheeses.

AB  == four laboratory sourdough fermentations, initiated with wheat or spelt flour and  without the addition of a starter culture, were prepared over a period of 10 days with daily back-slopping. samples taken at all refreshment steps were used for determination of the present microbiota. furthermore, an extensive metabolite target analysis of more than 100 different compounds was performed through a combination of various chromatographic methods including liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. the establishment of a stable microbial ecosystem occurred through a three-phase evolution within a week, as revealed by both microbiological and metabolite analyses. strains of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus rossiae, lactobacillus brevis, and lactobacillus paraplantarum were dominating some of the sourdough ecosystems. although the heterofermentative l. fermentum was dominating one of the wheat sourdoughs, all other sourdoughs were dominated by a combination of obligate and facultative heterofermentative taxa. strains of homofermentative species were not retrieved in the stable sourdough ecosystems. concentrations of sugar and amino acid metabolites hardly changed during the last days of fermentation. besides lactic acid, ethanol, and mannitol, the production of succinic acid, erythritol, and various amino acid metabolites,  such as phenyllactic acid, hydroxyphenyllactic acid, and indolelactic acid, was shown during fermentation. physiologically, they contributed to the equilibration of the redox balance. the biphasic approach of the present study allowed us to map some of the interactions taking place during sourdough fermentation and helped us to understand the fine-tuned metabolism of lactic acid bacteria, which  allows them to dominate a food ecosystem.

TI  == dynamics and biodiversity of populations of lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid  bacteria involved in spontaneous heap fermentation of cocoa beans in ghana.
AB  == the ghanaian cocoa bean heap fermentation process was studied through a multiphasic approach, encompassing both microbiological and metabolite target analyses. a culture-dependent (plating and incubation, followed by repetitive-sequence-based pcr analyses of picked-up colonies) and culture-independent (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis [dgge] of 16s rrna gene amplicons, pcr-dgge) approach revealed a limited biodiversity and targeted population dynamics of both lactic acid bacteria (lab) and acetic acid bacteria (aab) during fermentation. four main clusters were identified among the lab isolated: lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, and enterococcus casseliflavus. other taxa encompassed, for  instance, weissella. only four clusters were found among the aab identified: acetobacter pasteurianus, acetobacter syzygii-like bacteria, and two small clusters of acetobacter tropicalis-like bacteria. particular strains of l. plantarum, l. fermentum, and a. pasteurianus, originating from the environment, were well adapted to the environmental conditions prevailing during ghanaian cocoa bean heap fermentation and apparently played a significant role in the cocoa bean fermentation process. yeasts produced ethanol from sugars, and lab produced lactic acid, acetic acid, ethanol, and mannitol from sugars and/or citrate. whereas l. plantarum strains were abundant in the beginning of the fermentation, l. fermentum strains converted fructose into mannitol upon prolonged fermentation. a. pasteurianus grew on ethanol, mannitol, and lactate and converted ethanol into acetic acid. a newly proposed weissella sp., referred  to as "weissella ghanaensis," was detected through pcr-dgge analysis in some of the fermentations and was only occasionally picked up through culture-based isolation. two new species of acetobacter were found as well, namely, the species tentatively named "acetobacter senegalensis" (a. tropicalis-like) and "acetobacter ghanaensis" (a. syzygii-like).

AB  == a total of 375 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from fermenting cassava in south africa, benin, kenya and germany, and were characterised by phenotypic and  genotypic tests. these could be divided into five main groups comprising strains  of facultatively heterofermentative rods, obligately heterofermentative rods, heterofermentative cocci, homofermentative cocci and obligately homofermentative  rods, in decreasing order of predominance. most of the facultatively heterofermentative rods were identified by phenotypic tests as presumptive lactobacillus plantarum-group strains, which also comprised the most predominant  bacteria (54.4% of strains) isolated in the study. the next predominant group of  lactic acid bacteria (14.1% of total isolates) consisted of obligately heterofermentative rods belonging either to the genus lactobacillus or weissella, followed by the heterofermentative cocci (13.9% of isolates) belonging to the genera weissella or leuconostoc. homofermentative cocci were also isolated (13.3% of isolates). biochemical properties such as production of alpha-amylase, beta-glucosidase, tannase, antimicrobials (presumptive bacteriocin and h(2)o(2)-production), acidification and fermentation of the indigestible sugars raffinose and stachyose, were evaluated in vitro for selection of potential starter strains. a total of 32 strains with one or more desirable biochemical properties were pre-selected and identified using rep-pcr fingerprinting in combination with 16s rrna sequencing of representative rep-pcr cluster isolates.  of these strains, 18 were identified as l. plantarum, four as lactobacillus pentosus, two each as leuconostoc fallax, weissella paramesenteroides and lactobacillus fermentum, one each as leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and weissella cibaria, while two remained unidentified but could be assigned to the l. plantarum-group. these strains were further investigated for clonal relationships, using rapd-pcr with three primers, and of the 32 a total of 16 strains were finally selected for the development as starter cultures for gari production.

TI  == nonstarter lactobacilli isolated from soft and semihard argentinean cheeses: genetic characterization and resistance to biological barriers.
AB  == nonstarter lactic acid bacteria isolated from argentinean cheeses were identified and characterized by focusing on their resistance to biological barriers, along with other physiological features of potential interest, in the search for future probiotic organisms. lactobacilli were enumerated and isolated from semihard and  soft cheeses made with multistrain streptococcus thermophilus starters. lactobacilli counts in 1-week-old cheeses were between 10(5) and 10(7) cfu/g and  then reached 10(7) cfu/ g in all 1-month samples, while streptococci were always  above 10(9) cfu/g. a total number of 22 lactobacilli isolates were retained, identified, and characterized by in vitro tests. species identity was determined  by carbohydrate metabolism and species-specific pcr assays. genetic diversity was explored by random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) pcr analysis. the lactobacillus strains were assigned to the species l. casei, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, and l. perolens. all the strains studied tolerated 25 ppm of lysozyme, and most of them showed resistance to 0.3% bile. after incubation in gastric solution (ph 2.0), counts decreased by several log units, ranging from 3.2 to 7.0. the strains were able to grow in the presence of  bile salts, but only three isolates were capable of deconjugation. the nonstarter lactobacilli that were assayed fermented the prebiotic substrates (especially lactulose and inulin). some strains showed high cell hydrophobicity and beta-galactosidase activity, as well as inhibitory activity against pathogenic bacteria. it was concluded that most of the lactobacilli isolated in this study demonstrated resistance to biological barriers and physiological characteristics  compatible with probiotic properties, which make them suitable for further research in in vivo studies aimed at identifying new probiotic organisms.

TI  == quantitative evaluation of adhesion of lactobacilli isolated from human intestinal tissues to human colonic mucin using surface plasmon resonance (biacore assay).
AB  == aims: to isolate lactobacilli from the mucus layer of the human intestine and evaluate their adhesion abilities using a biacore assay. methods and results: thirty strains of lactobacilli were isolated from the mucus layer of normal human intestinal tissues using conventional plate culture. the strains were identified  using homology comparisons of the 16s rdna sequence to databases as lactobacillus salivarius (26%), lactobacillus fermentum (13%), lactobacillus gasseri (10%), lactobacillus paracasei (7%), lactobacillus casei (3%), lactobacillus mucosae (3%) and lactobacillus plantarum (3%). lactobacillus plantarum la 318 shows the highest adhesion to human colonic mucin (hcm) using the biacore assay at 115.30 +/- 12.37 resonance unit (ru). the adhesion of cell wall surface proteins from strain la 318 was significantly higher to hcm than to bovine serum albumin (bsa;  p < 0.05). conclusions: we isolated 30 strains of lactobacilli. lactobacillus salivarius was the predominant species of lactobacilli isolated in this study. the adhesion of strain la 318 isolated from human transverse colon to its mucin was shown. the adhesion could be mediated by lectin-like components on the bacterial cell surface. significance and impact of the study: this is the first study where lactobacilli were isolated from human intestinal tissues and shown to adhere to hcm.

TI  == the microbiology of ghanaian cocoa fermentations analysed using culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == export of cocoa beans is of great economic importance in ghana and several other  tropical countries. raw cocoa has an astringent unpleasant taste and a spontaneous fermentation is the first step in a process leading to cocoa beans with the characteristic cocoa flavour and taste. the microbiology of ghanaian cocoa fermentations was investigated using culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. samples were collected at 12 hour intervals during 96-144 hour tray and traditional heap fermentations. yeast, lactic acid bacteria  (lab), acetic acid bacteria (aab) and bacillus spp. were enumerated on suitable substrates and identified using phenotypic and molecular methods. the yeast and bacterial micro-populations involved in the cocoa fermentation were further investigated using the culture-independent method denaturing gradient gel electrophopresis (dgge). a microbiological succession was observed during the fermentations. at the onset of fermentation yeasts were the dominating microorganisms. lactic acid bacteria became dominant after 12-24 h of fermentation and remained predominant throughout the fermentations with aab reaching high counts in the mid phase of fermentation. bacillus spp. were only detected during heap fermentations where they reached high numbers during the later stages of fermentation. hanseniaspora guilliermondii was the predominant yeast during the initial phase and pichia membranifaciens during the later phases of fermentation. a number of other yeast species including three putatively undescribed species were isolated during the fermentations. lactobacillus fermentum was the dominant lab in most samples. several other lab including lactobacillus plantarum, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudoficulneum, pediocococcus acidilactici and a putatively undescribed lab species were detected during the fermentations. acetobacter syzygii, acetobacter  pasteurianus and acetobacter tropicalis were the predominant aab in all investigated fermentations. during the later stages of heap fermentation bacillus licheniformis and occasionally other bacillus spp. were detected in high numbers. in general the culture-based findings were confirmed using dgge. however, dgge indicated that lc. pseudoficulneum plays a more important role during the fermentation of cocoa than expected from the culture-based findings as it yielded a strong band in most dgge fingerprints. cluster analysis of the dgge fingerprints revealed that the dgge fingerprints clustered according to fermentation site. within each fermentation site the profiles clustered according to fermentation time. the dgge method seems to offer a relatively fast and reliable tool for studying yeast and bacterial dynamics during cocoa fermentations.

TI  == expression of the immunity protein of plantaricin 423, produced by lactobacillus  plantarum 423, and analysis of the plasmid encoding the bacteriocin.
AB  == plantaricin 423 is a class iia bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum isolated from sorghum beer. it has been previously determined that plantaricin 423 is encoded by a plasmid designated ppla4, which is now completely sequenced.  the plantaricin 423 operon shares high sequence similarity with the operons of coagulin, pediocin pa-1, and pediocin ach, with small differences in the dna sequence encoding the mature bacteriocin peptide and the immunity protein. apart  from the bacteriocin operon, no significant sequence similarity could be detected between the dna or translated sequence of ppla4 and the available dna or translated sequences of the plasmids encoding pediocin ach, pediocin pa-1, and coagulin, possibly indicating a different origin. in addition to the bacteriocin  operon, sequence analysis of ppla4 revealed the presence of two open reading frames (orfs). orf1 encodes a putative mobilization (mob) protein that is homologous to the pmv158 superfamily of mobilization proteins. highest sequence similarity occurred between this protein and the mob protein of l. plantarum ncdo 1088. orf2 encodes a putative replication protein that revealed low sequence similarity to replication proteins of plasmids plme300 from lactobacillus fermentum and pyit356 from lactobacillus casei. the immunity protein of plantaricin 423 contains 109 amino acids. although plantaricin 423 shares high sequence similarity with the pediocin pa-1 operon, no cross-reactivity was recorded between the immunity proteins of plantaricin 423 and pediocin pa-1.

AB  == non-enterococcal gram-positive bacteria that are intrinsically vancomycin-resistant have been infrequently isolated in association with serious  infections. however, well-documented infections have lately been reported with increasing frequency. because these organisms may be pathogens, we tested the mics of 19 antimicrobial agents by the agar dilution method for predicting susceptibility. the activity of these antimicrobial agents was assessed against 28 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 6; lactobacillus acidophilus, 1; lactobacillus casei, 1; lactobacillus fermentum, 2; lactobacillus brevis, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1; weissella confusa, 2; leuconostoc mesenteroides, 7; leuconostoc lactis, 4; pediococcus acidilactici, 2; pediococcus pentosaceus, 1),  isolated from clinical specimens in an argentinian university hospital from 1997  to 2003. the mics of penicillin for 67% of the lactobacillus strains and 100% of  the leuconostoc spp. and pediococcus spp. strains tested were in the 0.25-2 microg/ml range. erythromycin was the most active antimicrobial overall. multiresistance was observed in 2 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1).

TI  == molecular identification of vaginal lactobacilli isolated from bulgarian women.
AB  == lactobacilli play an important role in maintaining the vaginal health of women. the development of suitable bacterial replacement therapies for the treatment of  vaginosis requires knowledge of the vaginal lactobacilli species representation.  the aim of this study was to identify at the species level vaginal lactobacillus  isolates obtained from bulgarian women in childbearing age by using different molecular methods. twenty-two strains of lactobacilli isolated from vaginal samples were identified and grouped according to their genetic relatedness. a combined approach, which included amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra), ribotyping and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with species-specific oligonucleotide primers was applied. all vaginal isolates were grouped into 5 clusters in comparison with a set of 21 reference strains based on the initial ardra results, which was then confirmed by ribotyping. finally, the strains were  subjected to pcr analysis with eight different species-specific primer pairs, which allowed most of them to be classified as belonging to one of the following  species: lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus helveticus and lactobacillus plantarum. in conclusion, this study suggests that the most straightforward identification strategy for vaginal lactobacilli would be grouping by ardra or ribotyping, followed by pcr specific primers identification at species level.

TI  == culture-independent analysis of the microbial composition of the african traditional fermented foods poto poto and degue by using three different dna extraction methods.
AB  == the microbial composition of the traditional fermented foods poto poto (a maize dough from the rep. of congo) and degue (a millet dough from burkina faso) was studied by a culture-independent approach using ttge to separate the amplified target v3 region of the 16s rrna gene from total microbial community, followed by dna sequencing and homology search. three different extraction methods were used. guanidium thiocyanate-based dna extraction provided better performance regarding  purity and dna yield, allowing the detection of a higher number of dna bands by ttge in poto poto. by contrast, all three methods yielded similar results for degue samples, indicating that the performance of the dna extraction method largely depends on the food composition. sequencing of dna bands from ttge gels corresponding to poto poto samples revealed the presence of lactobacillus gasseri, enterococcus sp., escherichia coli, lactobacillus plantarum/paraplantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, bacillus sp., lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus casei. the following bacteria were identified in degue: l. gasseri, enterococcus sp., e. coli, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, and l. casei.

TI  == [study of vaginal and intestinal microflora of women in the prenatal period and its correction in dysbacteriosis].
AB  == a comparative research of the structure of vaginal and intestinal microflora in norm and at kidney pathologies in women in the prenatal period was carried out. at physiologically normal course of pregnancy microbiocenosis of vagina and intestine does not contain pathogenic and conditional-pathogenic microorganisms.  lactic acid bacteria are fixed within the limits of 10(5)-10(8) cfu/1 ml in the vagina secretion and 10(7)-10(8) cfu/1 g in the intestine content. the spore microorganisms have completely disappeared in vaginal biocenosis of women with pyelonephritis after pharmacotherapy; and colibacterias has disappeared in 62% of women. quantity of lactic acid bacteria has also decreased. quantity of e. coli (10(8)- 10(9)) cfu/g, sporous microorganisms (10(3)-10(4)) cfu/g and yeast (10(4)-10(5)) cfu/g has considerably increased in the content of intestine. lactic acid bacteria in content of the vagina are presented by: lactobacillus acidophilus, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. vaginalis; in content of the intestine--l. plantarum and l. fermentum. all the isolated strains of lactobacilli are resistant to metrogyl and amphotericin, 87%--to cephoxitine, cypropfloxacine. twenty three of 24 strains of lactic acid bacteria--antagonists  of pathogenic microflora have shown adhesion to vaginal epthelium. the degree of  adhesive activity depends on the strain and genus specificity of cultures. the highest index of adhesiveness in indicated in enterococcus faecium (5.82 - 7.62)  and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (2.74 - 6.40) strains. the screening of strains has been performed, which suppress growth of gas-producing microflora. the strain of lactobacillus plantarum 200d proved to be the most active one. a complex of cultures of the lactic bacteria providing normalization  of microbial cenosis of the vagina in women in the prenatal period has been selected as based on the data obtained. the biotechnology of production of vaginal suppositories is developed.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr analysis of fecal lactobacillus species in infants receiving a prebiotic infant formula.
AB  == the developing intestinal microbiota of breast-fed infants is considered to play  an important role in the priming of the infants' mucosal and systemic immunity. generally, bifidobacterium and lactobacillus predominate the microbiota of breast-fed infants. in intervention trials it has been shown that lactobacilli can exert beneficial effects on, for example, diarrhea and atopy. however, the lactobacillus species distribution in breast-fed or formula-fed infants has not yet been determined in great detail. for accurate enumeration of different lactobacilli, duplex 5' nuclease assays, targeted on rrna intergenic spacer regions, were developed for lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the  designed and validated assays were used to determine the amounts of different lactobacillus species in fecal samples of infants receiving a standard formula (sf) or a standard formula supplemented with galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides in a 9:1 ratio (osf). a breast-fed group (bf) was studied in parallel as a reference. during the 6-week intervention period a significant increase was shown in total percentage of fecal lactobacilli in the bf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.1% +/- 1.5%) and the osf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.4% +/- 1.4%). the lactobacillus species distribution in the osf group was comparable to breast-fed  infants, with relatively high levels of l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, and l. casei. the sf-fed infants, on the other hand, contained more l. delbrueckii and less l. paracasei compared to breast-fed infants and osf-fed infants. an infant milk formula containing a specific mixture of prebiotics is able to induce a microbiota that closely resembles the microbiota of bf infants.

AB  == background/aims: the genus lactobacillus has been associated with dental caries in humans, although it is seldom speciated due to lack of simple and nonlaborious identification methods. a considerable heterogeneity among lactobacillus species  has been demonstrated. the purpose of this study was to develop simple methods combining restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-amplified 16s rrna (16s rrna gene pcr-rflp) and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) for the identification of 13 reference strains of lactobacillus. methods: the 16s rrna gene sequences were  amplified by pcr using universal primers and digestion of pcr products with the restriction endonucleases, hpaii and haeiii. the 16s rrna gene pcr-rflp is reproducible and has been proved to be useful for differentiating lactobacillus strains to species level. seventy-seven lactobacillus isolates from a thai population were used to show the applicability of the identification test. results: pcr-rflp alone had limitations, because the rflp patterns of lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus rhamnosus and of lactobacillus acidophilus  and lactobacillus crispatus showed similar patterns; however, these could be differentiated by sds-page. of the 77 isolates, 38 were identified as lactobacillus fermentum, 25 as l. rhamnosus, 5 as lactobacillus salivarius, 5 as  l. casei, 3 as l. acidophilus and 1 as lactobacillus plantarum. conclusion: 16s rrna gene pcr-rflp, using hpaii and haeiii, together with sds-page protein profiles could be an alternative method for the identification of oral lactobacillus strains to species level, and may be applicable for large-scale studies on the association of lactobacillus to dental caries.

TI  == microbiological study of lactic acid fermentation of caper berries by molecular and culture-dependent methods.
AB  == fermentation of capers (the fruits of capparis sp.) was studied by molecular and  culture-independent methods. a lactic acid fermentation occurred following immersion of caper berries in water, resulting in fast acidification and development of the organoleptic properties typical of this fermented food. a collection of 133 isolates obtained at different times of fermentation was reduced to 75 after randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis. isolates were identified by pcr or 16s rrna gene sequencing as lactobacillus plantarum (37 isolates), lactobacillus paraplantarum (1 isolate), lactobacillus pentosus (5 isolates), lactobacillus brevis (9 isolates), lactobacillus fermentum (6 isolates), pediococcus pentosaceus (14 isolates), pediococcus acidilactici (1  isolate), and enterococcus faecium (2 isolates). cluster analysis of rapd-pcr patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among lactobacilli (with four major  groups and five subgroups), while pediococci clustered in two closely related groups. a culture-independent analysis of fermentation samples by temporal temperature gradient electrophoresis (ttge) also indicated that l. plantarum is the predominant species in this fermentation, in agreement with culture-dependent results. the distribution of l. brevis and l. fermentum in samples was also determined by ttge, but identification of pediococcus at the species level was not possible. ttge also allowed a more precise estimation of the distribution of  e. faecium, and the detection of enterococcus casseliflavus (which was not revealed by the culture-dependent analysis). results from this study indicate that complementary data from molecular and culture-dependent analysis provide a more accurate determination of the microbial community dynamics during caper fermentation.

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

AB  == the presence of lactic acid bacteria (lab) during shochu fermentation was monitored by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and by bacteriological culturing. no lab were detected from fermented mashes by pcr-dgge using a universal bacterial pcr primer set. however, pcr-dgge using a new primer  specific for the 16s rdna of lactococcus, streptococcus, tetragenococcus, enterococcus, and vagococcus and two primers specific for the 16s rdna of lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, and weissella revealed that enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus nagelii, lactobacillus plantarum, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and weissella cibaria inhabited in shochu mashes. it was also found that the lab community composition during shochu fermentation changed after the main ingredient and water were added during the fermentation process. therefore, we confirmed that pcr-dgge using all three primers specific for groups of lab together was well suited to the study of the lab diversity in shochu mashes. the results of dgge profiles were similar to the results of bacteriological culturing. in conclusion, lab are present during shochu fermentation but not dominant.

TI  == effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  == fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. in this study, three sourdough yeasts, candida milleri cbs 8195, saccharomyces cerevisiae ts 146, and torulaspora delbrueckii ts 207; a control, baker's yeast s. cerevisiae alko 743; and four lactobacillus spp., l. acidophilus tsb 262, l. brevis tsb 307, l. plantarum tsb 304, and l. sanfranciscensis tsb 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. the microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. total folate contents were determined using lactobacillus rhamnosus (atcc 7469) as the growth  indicator organism. the microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised  rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g  after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. strains of lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, l. helveticus, pediococcus spp., and streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. although the four lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal.  it was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as enterobacter cowanii and pantoea agglomerans.

TI  == [antifungal effect in selected natural compounds and probiotics and their possible use in prophylaxis of vulvovaginitis].
AB  == objective: a survey of effective natural compounds and probiotics with antifungal activity and their possible use in vulvovaginitis as a prophylactic or therapeutic drug. design: review of literature. setting: charles university at prague, pharmaceutical faculty at hradec kralove. methods: and review of literature and publications from medical data-bases. conclusions: certain natural compounds were proved to exert antimycotic effects. the efficiency of garlic extract under in vitro conditions against yeast of c. albicans family becomes manifest within one hour. essential oils present in the cayenne pepper (capsodum  frutescens) exert considerable antifungal activity against c. albicans as well. clove exerts lower antimycotic effects. the effects of chinese leek are similar to garlic. propolis also possesses antifungal properties, and sensitivity of the  yeast strains decreases in the following order: c. albicans > c. tropicalis > c.  crusei > c. guilliermondii. its efficiency depends on the composition and place of origin. tea trea oil (melalauca alternifolia) is inhibiting strains of candida family (genus) in minimal inhibiting concentration, higher concentrations are necessary for c. crusei and c. norvengensis. in the prophylaxis of vaginal candidoses, oral administration of the strains of lactobacilus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14, b-54 may be recommended. moreover there are suitable strains  of l. brevis cd-2, l. salivarius fv-2, l. gasseri mb 335, l. plantarum, useful in the form of gel capsules (l. plantarum) or vaginal tablets (l. gasseri). the strains of l. acidophilus crl 1294 and l. salivarius crl 1328 display the capacity of self aggregation and co-aggregation with candida. it should be pointed out that the probiotic strain of lactobacillus (especially l. casei and l. rhamnosus) may, in exceptional cases, cause bacteriemia and sepsis, especially in immunodeficient patients and those who underwent surgery of alimentary tract.  no protective effect against yeast infection was detected with vitamin e, any positive effect was not unequivocally confirmed with zinc, but adjusting zinc levels to normal may be recommended.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria and yeasts associated with spontaneous fermentations during  the production of sour cassava starch in brazil.
AB  == sour cassava starch is a traditional fermented food used in the preparation of fried foods and baked goods such as traditional cheese breads in brazil. thirty samples of sour cassava starch were collected from two factories in the state of  minas gerais. the samples were examined for the presence of lactic acid bacteria, yeasts, mesophilic microorganisms, bacillus cereus and faecal coliforms. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolates were identified by biochemical tests, and the identities were confirmed by molecular methods. lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus fermentum were the prevalent lactic acid bacteria in product from both factories, at numbers between 6.0 and 9.0 log cfu g(-)(1). lactobacillus perolans and lactobacillus brevis were minor fractions of the population. galactomyces geothricum and issatchenkia sp. were the prevalent yeasts at numbers of 5.0 log cfu g(-)(1). a species similar to candida ethanolica was frequently isolated from one factory. mesophilic bacteria and amylolytic microorganisms were recovered in high numbers at all stages of the fermentation. b. cereus was found  at low numbers in product at both factories. the spontaneous fermentations associated with the production of sour cassava starch involve a few species of lactic acid bacteria at high numbers and a variety of yeasts at relatively low numbers.

TI  == [inhibitory activity of vaginal lactobacillus bacteria on yeasts causing vulvovaginal candidiasis].
AB  == growing frequency of therapeutical failures of vulvovaginal candidiasis, resulting from resistance of certain species of candida to imidazole agents, raises interest in the use of probiotics from lactobacillus genera as prophylaxis. unfortunately, little is known about inhibitory mechanisms of lactobacillus on candida. the aim of this study was to compare the activity of selected lactobacillus species, representing the physiological vaginal flora, against candida as well as investigation whether their inhibitory activity against candida is related strictly to hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid production. 125 strains from vaginal smears of healthy women were classified by making use of phenotypic and genotypic methods. the majority of strains belonged  to l. acidophilus: l. acidophilus sensu stricto, l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l.  johnsonii as well as l. fermentum and l. plantarum species. culture supernatants  of selected 25 strains representing the isolated species were examined for their  inhibitory activity against the growth of candida albicans and c. glabrata. the results showed that the strongest and the fastest activity against c. albicans was demonstrated by l. delbrueckii strains, producing the largest quantities of hydrogen peroxide. on the other hand, extended activity, demonstrable after 24 hours, was shown by non-h2o2 producing l. plantarum supernatants. growth of c. glabrata was not inhibited by any of the examined strains of lactobacillus. comparison of activity of live active cultures of lactobacillus strains and their mixtures with this of pure h2o2 and lactic acid has shown that pure chemical compounds were less active than the cultures. this suggests that mixtures of lactobacillus strains are in cooperation with each other using many different metabolites.

TI  == diversity and technological properties of predominant lactic acid bacteria from fermented cassava used for the preparation of gari, a traditional african food.
AB  == traditional fermentation of cassava is dominated by a lactic acid bacteria (lab)  population. fermentation is important for improving product flavour and aroma as  well as safety, especially by reduction of its toxic cyanogenic glucosides. the production of gari from cassava in benin typically occurs on a household or small industrial scale, and consequently suffers from inconsistent product quality and  may not always be safe for consumption. therefore, the diversity of lab from a typical cassava fermentation for the preparation of gari, and their technologically relevant characteristics were investigated with a view towards selection of appropriate starter cultures. a total of 139 predominant strains isolated from fermenting cassava were identified using phenotypic tests and genotypic methods such as rep-pcr and rapd-pcr. dna-dna hybridisation and sequencing of the 16s rrna genes were done for selected strains. lactobacillus plantarum was the most abundantly isolated species (54.6% of isolates), followed  by leuconostoc fallax (22.3%) and lactobacillus fermentum (18.0%). lactobacillus  brevis, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides and weissella paramesenteroides were sporadically isolated. the l. plantarum strains were shown to be better acid producers and capable of faster acid production than the l. fallax or l. fermentum strains. the incidence of beta-glucosidase (linamarase) activity was also highest among strains of this species. production of antagonistic substances such as h2o2 and bacteriocins, however, was more common among l. fallax and l. fermentum strains. strains of all three species were capable of utilising the indigestible sugars raffinose and stachyose. therefore, a starter culture containing a mixture of strains from all three species was recommended.

TI  == growth of lactic acid bacteria and rhizopus oligosporus during barley tempeh fermentation.
AB  == the zygomycete rhizopus oligosporus is traditionally used to ferment soybean tempeh, but it is also possible to ferment other legumes and cereals to tempeh. the traditional soybean tempeh harbours a multitude of microorganisms with potentially beneficial or detrimental effects on quality. lactic acid bacteria (lab) have positive effects on the safety of soybean tempeh, but the effects of lab on r. oligosporus growth have not been investigated. we have developed a cereal grain tempeh by fermenting pearled barley with r. oligosporus atcc 64063.  four lab species, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus reuteri and lactococcus lactis were assessed for their growth abilities and their effects on r. oligosporus growth during barley tempeh fermentation. growth of lab was assayed as colony forming units (cfu), while growth of r. oligosporus was measured as ergosterol content and hyphal length. the two fungal measurements highly correlated (r=0.83, p<0.001, n=90). the ergosterol content of fungal mycelia ranged from 11.7 to 30.1 mg/g fungal dry matter. l. plantarum multiplied  from 4.8 to 7.4 log cfu/g dry tempeh and l. fermentum increased from 4.4 to 6.8 log cfu/g during 24 h incubation at 35 degrees c. l. reuteri and l. lactis had significantly slower growth, with increases from 4.8 to 5.6 log cfu/g and 5.0 to  5.4 log cfu/g, respectively. the growth of r. oligosporus and the final ph (4.9)  in barley tempeh were not significantly influenced by any of the lab investigated.

AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

TI  == the microflora of fermented nixtamalized corn.
AB  == nixtamalization is a traditional process that improves the nutritional quality of corn. to provide a means of utilizing the nutritional benefits of nixtamalized corn and improve product acceptability, lactic acid fermentation was applied. the objective of the study was to study the microbial profile and establish the important lactobacilli of fermenting nixtamalized corn dough. two batches of cleaned whole corn were subjected to the process of nixtamalization, using two concentrations of lime (0.5 or 1.0%), milled, made into a dough (50% moisture) and fermented spontaneously for 72 h. a control sample was prepared without alkaline treatment. ph and titratable acidity of the dough were measured. aerobic mesophiles, lactic acid bacteria, yeasts and molds were enumerated on plate count agar (pca), deman, rogossa and sharpe (mrs) agar and malt extract agar (mea), respectively. the identity of lactobacilli present was established at the species level using api 50 chl. the ph of all the fermenting systems decreased with fermentation time with concomitant increase in titratable acidity. lactic acid bacteria in numbers of 1.6 x 10(9), 2.3 x 10(9) and 1.8 x 10(9) cfu/g, respectively yeasts and molds, and numbers of 8.0 x 10(7), 5.0 x 10(5) and 1.7 x  10(5) cfu/g, respectively were observed in the control and the two nixtamalized (0.5% and 1.0% lime) samples after 48 h of fermentation. lactobacilli identified  in the fermenting nixtamalized corn dough were lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus cellobiosus as well as pediococcus spp. the study demonstrates that nixtamalized corn though alkaline in nature can be subjected to spontaneous fermentation to produce a sour product.

AB  == examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of lactobacillus fermentum br11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kda  protein termed sep. the amino-terminal sequence of sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of lactobacillus reuteri, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and lactobacillus plantarum. the carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) surface proteins of lactobacillus gasseri and  lactobacillus johnsonii. the mature amino terminus of sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain, thereby making it distinct from apf proteins.  we have identified a common motif within lysm domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding yg motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in l. fermentum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactococcus lactis mg1363. modified sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and l. lactis hosts. sep as well as the previously described surface protein bspa were used to express and secrete in l.  fermentum or l. rhamnosus a fragment of human e-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for listeria monocytogenes. this study demonstrates that sep has  potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.

AB  == nostrano di primiero is a 6-month ripened cheese produced from raw milk collected in the paneveggio-pale di san martino natural park area in the italian dolomites. in summer, this cheese is made using milk collected from two different areas, passo rolle and vanoi, in the paneveggio natural park. during the experiment, the milk from the two areas was separately processed, and cheeses were made in the same cheese factory using the same technological process. the microbiota of raw milk and cheeses of the two areas was isolated and the dominant population was monitored by rapd analysis and identified by 16s rrna sequence. the milk of the passo rolle area was mainly composed of mesophilic strains, thermophilic streptococcus thermophilus, and low amounts of enterococci were also found; the milk of the vanoi area was dominated by mesophilic microbiota mostly lactococcus  lactis ssp. cremoris and ssp. lactis and lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei.  the plating of the natural starter culture revealed the presence of a relevant community of thermophilic cocci and lower amounts of enterococci. the dynamic population analysis showed the importance of the natural starter culture in the first 2 days of cheese ripening in both cheeses. moreover, the large biodiversity observed in the raw milks was also detected in the cheeses during ripening. the vanoi cheese was dominated by enterococcus faecium and streptococcus macedonicus  in the first two days and mesophilic 21 lb. paracasei ssp. paracasei became the most represented population after 15 days of ripening. in the first few days, the rolle cheese was characterized by being mainly composed of thermophilic s. macedonicus and s. thermophilus and secondarily by mesophilic cocci. during ripening, the microbiota composition changed, and at 15 days, mesophilic lactobacilli were the dominant population, but later, this was mainly composed of mesophilic cocci and lactobacilli. the taxonomical identification by 16s rrna sequence confirmed a large biodiversity related to raw milk microbiota and only five strains of s. macedonicus, lactobacillus plantarum, 21 lb. paracasei ssp. paracasei, lactobacillus fermentum and e. faecium were detected in both cheeses.

AB  == lactic acid bacteria, bacillus species and yeasts are involved in the fermentation of cassava dough into agbelima. microbial interactions within and between these groups of microorganisms were investigated in addition to the survival of five enteric pathogens inoculated into agbelima under various conditions. nine out of 10 cultures of lactic acid bacteria isolated at the end of agbelima fermentation showed inhibitory effect against 10 cultures of lactic acid bacteria isolated at the start of fermentation. only 3 out of 10 isolates of bacillus subtilis were inhibited by 10 isolates of lactic acid bacteria tested. no interactions were observed between yeasts and the lactic acid bacteria, whereas three of the bacillus isolates showed inhibitory effects against the yeasts. twelve isolates of lactobacillus plantarum tested inhibited the growth of an isolate each of lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus brevis but none tested positive for bacteriocin production. the antimicrobial effect of the lactic acid bacteria was attributed to acid production. in fermenting cassava dough, enteric pathogens survived to different extents depending on ph and their  sensitivity to acids. vibrio cholerae c-230, salmonella typhimurium 9 and salmonella enteritidis 226 were not detectable in 10 g of sample after 4 h when inoculated into the 48-h fermented product, agbelima, whereas shigella dysenteriae 2357t and escherichia coli d2188 were detectable up to 8 h in the product.

TI  == role of peptidoglycan subtypes in the pathogenesis of bacterial cell wall arthritis.
AB  == background: bacterial cell wall (cw) arthritis develops in susceptible strains of rats after a single intraperitoneal injection of the cw from certain bacterial species, both pathogenic and non-pathogenic. for the development of chronic bacterial cw arthritis, the structure of the bacterial peptidoglycan (pg) has been found to be decisive. objective: to define the role of pg subtypes in the pathogenesis of chronic bacterial cw arthritis. method: arthritis was induced with cws of lactobacillus plantarum, l casei b, l casei c, and l fermentum. gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to measure the presence of cw derived muramic acid in the liver and to determine pg subtypes. cws were also tested for  their resistance to lysozyme in vitro. results: these results and those published previously indicate that pgs of cws which induce chronic arthritis, no matter whether they were derived from strains of streptococcus, bifidobacterium, collinsella, or lactobacillus, all have lysine as the third amino acid of the pg  stem peptide, representing pg subtypes a3alpha and a4alpha. those strains which induce only transient acute arthritis or no arthritis at all do not have lysine in this position, resulting in different pg subtypes. conclusions: in vivo degradation of only those pgs with the subtypes a3alpha and a4alpha leads to the  occurrence of large cw fragments, which persist in tissue and have good proinflammatory ability. cws with other pg subtypes, even if they are lysozyme resistant, do not cause chronic arthritis, because the released fragments are not phlogistic. it is emphasised that a variety of microbial components not causing inflammation have been found in animal and human synovial tissue.

TI  == the potential of dairy lactic acid bacteria to metabolise amino acids via non-transaminating reactions and endogenous transamination.
AB  == the metabolism of amino acids by 22 starter and 49 non-starter lactic acid bacteria (lab) was studied in a system consisting of amino acids and non-growing  cells without added amino acceptors such as alpha-ketoglutarate. there were significant inter- and intra-species differences in the metabolism of amino acids. some amino acids such as alanine, arginine, aspartate, serine and branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine) were utilised, whereas other amino acids such as glycine, ornithine and citrulline were produced. alanine and aspartate were utilised by some lab and accumulated during  the incubation of other lab. arginine was degraded not only by lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (the lactococcal subspecies known to catabolise arginine), but also by pediococci, heterofermentative lactobacilli (lactobacillus brevis and lb. fermentum) and some unidentified homofermentative lactobacilli. serine was utilised predominantly by homofermentative lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei, lb. rhamnosus and lb. plantarum. of the lab studied, lb. brevis and lb. fermentum were the most metabolically active, utilising alanine, arginine, aspartate, glutamate and branched-chain amino acids. leuconostocs were the least metabolically active, showing little potential to metabolise amino acids. the formation of ammonia and acetate from amino acid metabolism varied both between species and between strains within species. these findings suggest that the potential of lab for amino acid metabolism via non-transaminating reactions and endogenous transamination will impact both on the physiology of lab and on cheese ripening, especially when transamination is rate-limiting in the absence of an exogenous amino acceptor such as alpha-ketoglutarate.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from human vaginal secretions.
AB  == a total of 57 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from the vaginal secretions of 259 patients. of these strains, 37 were isolated from patients attending pre-natal clinics and the remaining strains from patients attending post-natal clinics. the strains were identified by using simple physiological and biochemical tests and their phenotypic relatedness determined by numerical analysis of total soluble cell protein patterns. the genotypic relatedness of representative strains selected from each of the protein profile clusters was determined by numerical analysis of the dna banding patterns obtained from rapd-pcr. the majority of lactobacilli isolated belonged to the species lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus fermentum and enterococcus faecium. a few strains of lactobacillus plantarum and weissella viridescens were also isolated.  one strain, tv 1029, grouped into the same protein profile cluster as e. faecium, but revealed a dna banding pattern closer related to enterococcus faecalis. this  is the first report of w. viridescens associated with the human vagina.

TI  == proteolytic activities in togwa, a tanzanian fermented food.
AB  == proteolytic activities were investigated in sorghum-based togwa prepared by natural fermentation and using starter cultures previously isolated from the native product, i.e., lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, and issatchenkia orientalis in coculture with either l. brevis or l. plantarum. both  proteinase and aminopeptidase activities were substantially higher in naturally fermented togwa than in those with starters (14-30%, 12-70%, respectively). a variable but substantial part of the proteinase activity followed the particulate fraction of togwa; aminopeptidase activity was mainly in that fraction. the breakdown of relatively high molecular mass protein (64 kda) in togwa was detected by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page); the products were mainly in the 14-30 kda range. reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography (rp-fplc)-protein/peptide patterns changed during fermentation with some variation between togwa of different cultures. supplementation of gruel with malt increased the concentration of total protein [from 9.5% to 11.0% (w/w) on dry weight basis)] and of most of the free amino acids. fermentation had no effect on total protein content; however, the concentration of most of the amino acids was reduced, except for the proline content that increased. natural fermentation also increased the concentration of  glutamic acid and ornithine. fermentation by p. pentosaceus increased aspartic acid, while l. cellobiosus, l. fermentum, and l. brevis in coculture with i. orientalis increased the concentration of citrulline.

TI  == probiotics and the urologist.
AB  == emerging from the stigma of once being referred to as "snake oil", excellent scientific and clinical evidence now exists to indicate that probiotics do indeed have a role to play in medicine. the proper definition of probiotics is important "live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health  benefit on the host", for several reasons. it rules out so-called probiotics that have no clinically proven, peer-reviewed data, and it states the need to have viable bacteria present, unlike these pseudo products which are often wrongly labeled, poorly manufactured, with low or no viability at time of use. guidelines, prepared by the united nations and world health organization are now  available to guide physicians and consumers as to the types of strains with documented benefits. in urology, the most studied strains are lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum b-54 and rc-14. their use daily in oral form, or  once to three times weekly as a vaginal suppository, have been shown to reduce the urogenital pathogen load and the risk of urinary tract and vaginal infections. organisms such as oxalobacter formigenes, still in the r&d phase, offer great potential to reduce kidney stone formation via oxalate degradation in the intestine. some studies using l. casei shirota suggest a possible effect against bladder cancer, while studies using l. plantarum 299 show significantly reduced infection rates in patients undergoing major surgical procedures. in short, specific probiotic strains hold much promise for use in the urology setting.

TI  == use of starter cultures of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in the preparation of  togwa, a tanzanian fermented food.
AB  == starter cultures of lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum and pediococcus pentosaceus) and yeasts (candida pelliculosa, candida tropicalis, issatchenkia orientalis and saccharomyes cerevisiae) isolated from native togwa were tested singly or in combination for their ability to ferment maize-sorghum gruel to produce togwa. all species of bacteria showed an ability to ferment the gruel as  judged by lowering the ph from 5.87 to 3.24-3.49 and increasing the titratable acidity from 0.08% to 0.30-0.44% (w/w, lactic acid) in 24 h. yeasts used singly showed little activity within 12 h, but lowered the ph to 3.57-4.81 and increased the acidity to 0.11-0.21% in 24 h. yeasts in co-culture with lactic acid bacteria (lab) had a modest effect on the final acidity (p<0.05). the number of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts increased while the enterobacteriaceae decreased with fermentation time. the ph was lowered and lactic acid produced significantly (p<0.05) fastest in natural togwa fermentation and in samples fermented by l. plantarum or l. plantarum in co-culture with i. orientalis. the content of fermentable sugars was reduced during fermentation. most volatile flavour compounds were produced in samples from fermentation by p. pentosaceus and i. orientalis in co-culture with either l. plantarum or l. brevis.

TI  == lectin-like binding of lactobacilli considered for their use in probiotical preparations for animal use.
AB  == three gut lactobacilli from piglets (lactobacillus plantarum l 5, lactobacillus paracasei l 81, lactobacillus fermentum l 670) and lactobacillus casei subsp. pseudoplantarum l.c.) from a calf were examined by microtitre plate binding assay for their lectin-like binding activity after their cultivation on rogosa agar and in mrs broth. three ecm (extracellular matrix) molecules (fetuin, porcine fibronectin and porcine mucin) were selected for this assay. additionally, the effect of heparin on the binding of these three ecm molecules by lactobacillus strains in microtitre plates was tested. moreover, haemagglutination tests with pig, cattle, sheep, and hen erythrocytes were performed. however, none of the four lactobacillus strains examined did react with any of the erythrocytes tested. the differences between individual strains were observed in their binding to immobilised ecm molecules. the best adherent was the lactobacillus plantarum l5, however, the other three strains showed also good ecm binding. with regard to an influence of cultivation medium on lectin-like binding activity, binding of all ecm molecules was expressed in lactobacillus paracasei l 81 to significantly  higher degree (p < 0.001) after cultivation on rogosa agar than in mrs broth. similarly, strains lactobacillus fermentum l 670 and lactobacillus casei subsp. pseudoplantarum l.c. displayed significantly higher (p < 0.001) binding of fibronectin and mucin after growth on rogosa agar in comparison with mrs broth cultivation. however, no significant (on fetuin and fibronectin binding) or opposite effect (on mucin binding) of cultivation medium was observed in lactobacillus plantarum l 5 strain. the influence of cultivation medium on fetuin binding by lactobacillus fermentum l 670 was also not significant while lactobacillus casei subsp. pseudoplantarum l.c. bound fetuin significantly better (p < 0.01) after growth on rogosa agar. heparin pretreatment increased the binding of the ecm molecules by the lactobacillus fermentum l 670 strain significantly (p < 0.001 or p < 0.05) with the exception of porcine fibronectin when the strain was cultivated in mrs broth. this result is important especially  in the connection with the previous observations that heparin decreased ecm binding of enteropathogens as staphylococci or clinical enterococcal isolates. following up on some earlier strain characteristics, these results indicate that  the selected lactobacilli are probably suitable for probiotic purposes.

TI  == isolation, characterisation and identification of lactic acid bacteria from bushera: a ugandan traditional fermented beverage.
AB  == one hundred and thirteen strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) were selected from 351 isolates from 15 samples of traditionally fermented household bushera from uganda and also from laboratory-prepared bushera. isolates were phenotypically characterised by their ability to ferment 49 carbohydrates using api 50 chl kits  and additional biochemical tests. coliforms, yeasts and lab were enumerated in bushera. the ph, volatile organic compounds and organic acids were also determined. the lab counts in household bushera varied between 7.1 and 9.4 log cfu ml(-1). the coliform counts varied between < 1 and 5.2 log cfu ml(-1). the ph of bushera ranged from 3.7 to 4.5. ethanol (max, 0.27%) was the major volatile organic compound while lactic acid (max, 0.52%) was identified as the dominant organic acid in household bushera. the initial numbers of lab and coliforms in laboratory-fermented bushera were similar; however, the lab numbers increased faster during the first 24 h. lab counts increased from 5.5 to 9.0 log cfu ml(-1) during the laboratory fermentation. coliform counts increased from 5.9 to 7.8 log cfu ml(-1) at 24 h, but after 48 h, counts were less 4 log cfu ml(-1). yeasts increased from 4.3 to 7.7 log cfu ml(-1) at 48 h, but thereafter decreased slightly. the ph declined from 7.0 to around 4.0. lactic acid and ethanol increased from zero to 0.75% and 0.20%, respectively. lactic acid bacteria isolated from household bushera belonged to lactobacillus, streptococcus and enterococcus genera. tentatively, lactobacillus isolates were identified as lactobacillus plantarum, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. fermentum, l. brevis and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii. streptococcus thermophilus strains were also identified in household bushera. lab isolated from bushera produced in the laboratory belonged to five genera (lactococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus, weissella and enterococcus. eight isolates were able to produce acid from starch  and were identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (four strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (one strain), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum (one strain), weissella confusa (one strain) and l. plantarum (one strain).

TI  == isolation, characterization and inhibition by acarbose of the alpha-amylase from  lactobacillus fermentum: comparison with lb. manihotivorans and lb. plantarum amylases.
AB  == extracellular alpha-amylase from lactobacillus fermentum (fermenta) was purified  by glycogen precipitation and ion exchange chromatography. the purification was approximately 28-fold with a 27% yield. the fermenta molecular mass (106,000 da)  is in the same range as the ones determined for l. amylovorus (amyloa), l. plantarum (plantaa) and l. manihotivorans (manihoa) alpha-amylases. the amino acid composition of fermenta differs from the other lactobacilli considered here, but however, indicates that the peptidic sequence contains two equal parts: the n-terminal catalytic part; and the c-terminal repeats. the isoelectric point of fermenta, plantaa, manihoa are approximately the same (3.6). the fermenta optimum ph (5.0) is slightly more acidic and the optimum temperature is lower (40 degrees c). raw starch hydrolysis catalyzed by all three amylases liberates maltotriose and maltotretaose. maltose is also produced by fermenta and manihoa. maltohexaose fermenta catalyzed hydrolysis produces maltose and maltotriose. finally, kinetics of fermenta, plantaa and manihoa using amylose as a substrate and acarbose as an  inhibitor, were carried out. statistical analysis of kinetic data, expressed using a general velocity equation and assuming rapid equilibrium, showed that: (1) in the absence of inhibitor k(cat)/km are, respectively, 1x10(9), 12.6x10(9)  and 3.2x10(9) s(-1) m(-1); and (2) the inhibition of fermenta is of the mixed non-competitive type (k(1i)=5.27 microm; l(1i)=1.73 microm) while the inhibition  of plantaa and manihoa is of the uncompetitive type (l(1i)=1.93 microm and 1.52 microm, respectively). whatever the inhibition type, acarbose is a strong inhibitor of these lactobacillus amylases. these results indicate that, as found  in porcine and barley amylases, lactobacillus amylases contain in addition to the active site, a soluble carbohydrate (substrate or product) binding site.

TI  == growth studies of potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria in cereal-based substrates.
AB  == aims: the overall growth kinetics of four potentially probiotic strains (lactobacillus fermentum, lact. reuteri, lact. acidophilus and lact. plantarum) cultured in malt, barley and wheat media were investigated. the objectives were to identify the main factors influencing the growth and metabolic activity of each strain in association with the cereal substrate. methods and results: all fermentations were performed without ph control. a logistic-type equation, which  included a growth inhibition term, was used to describe the experimental data. in the malt medium, all strains attained high maximum cell populations (8.10-10.11 log10 cfu ml(-1), depending on the strain), probably due to the availability of maltose, sucrose, glucose, fructose (approx. 15 g l(-1) total fermentable sugars) and free amino nitrogen (approx. 80 mg l(-1)). the consumption of sugars during the exponential phase (10-12 h) resulted in the accumulation of lactic acid (1.06-1.99 g l(-1)) and acetic acid (0.29-0.59 g l(-1)), which progressively decreased the ph of the medium. each strain demonstrated a specific preference for one or more sugars. since small amounts of sugars were consumed by the end of the exponential phase (17-43%), the decisive growth-limiting factor was probably  the ph, which at that time ranged between 3.40 and 3.77 for all of the strains. analysis of the metabolic products confirmed the heterofermentative or homofermentative nature of the strains used, except in the case of lact. acidophilus which demonstrated a shift towards the heterofermentative pathway. all strains produced acetic acid during the exponential phase, which could be attributed to the presence of oxygen. lactobacillus plantarum, lact. reuteri and  lact. fermentum continued to consume the remaining sugars and accumulate metabolic products in the medium, probably due to energy requirements for cell viability, while lact. acidophilus entered directly into the decline phase. in the barley and wheat media all strains, especially lact. acidophilus and lact. reuteri, attained lower maximum cell populations (7.20-9.43 log10 cfu ml(-1)) than in the malt medium. this could be attributed to the low sugar content (3-4 g l(-1) total fermentable sugar for each medium) and the low free amino nitrogen concentration (15.3-26.6 mg l(-1)). in all fermentations, the microbial growth ceased at ph values (3.73-4.88, depending on the strain) lower than those observed for malt fermentations, which suggests that substrate deficiency in sugars and free amino nitrogen contributed to growth limitation. conclusions: the malt medium supported the growth of all strains more than barley and wheat media  due to its chemical composition, while lact. plantarum and lact. fermentum appeared to be less fastidious and more resistant to acidic conditions than lact. acidophilus and lact. reuteri. significance and impact of the study: cereals are  suitable substrates for the growth of potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == new efficient amylase-producing strains of lactobacillus plantarum and l. fermentum isolated from different nigerian traditional fermented foods.
AB  == amylolytic lactic acid bacteria (alab) were isolated from nigerian traditional fermented foods (fufu, burukutu, ogi-baba and kunu-zakki) with the aim of selecting efficient amylase-producing strains. nine isolates were characterized on the basis of their phenotypic and taxo-molecular characteristics. three groups could be distinguished by their fermentation profiles and this was confirmed by dna restriction analysis. though fermentation profiles gave good identification of strain k9 (unique representative of group iii) as lactobacillus fermentum, they could not be used to ascertain the taxonomic position of strains of groups i and ii. analysis of partial 16s rrna sequences led to the identification of these groups as l. plantarum strains and confirmed the species of strain k9 as l. fermentum. the two distinct phenotypic groups of l. plantarum differed in their use of d-xylose, l-arabinose, melibiose and were different from the previously described amylolytic l. plantarum a6 isolated from retted cassava in congo. l. fermentum k9 was different from l. fermentum ogie1 and mw2 isolated from benin maize sourdough and it is the first amylolytic l. fermentum described from nigerian fermented products. enzymatic profiles showed some differences between the strains of a similar fermentation group. one of the most relevant characteristics of the isolates was a higher yield of amylase production than those reported for previously described alab grown under the same conditions. furthermore, all isolates were tolerant to an exposure at ph 2 and to bile salts.

TI  == evaluation of nitric oxide production by lactobacilli.
AB  == six strains of lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus plantarum were investigated for nitric oxide (no) production. first, the potential presence of no synthase was examined. none of the strains of l. fermentum and l. plantarum examined produced no from l-arginine under aerobic conditions. interestingly, all l. fermentum strains expressed strong l-arginine deiminase activity. all l. fermentum strains produced no in mrs broth, but the no was found to be chemically derived from nitrite, which was produced by l. fermentum from nitrate present in  the medium. indeed all l. fermentum strains express nitrate reductase under anaerobic conditions. moreover, one strain, l. fermentum lf1, had nitrate reductase activity under aerobic conditions. it was also found that l. fermentum  strains jcm1173 and lf1 possessed ammonifying nitrite reductase. the latter strain also had denitrifying nitrite reductase activity at neutral ph under both  anaerobic and aerobic conditions. the lf1 strain is thus capable of biochemically converting nitrate to no. no and nitrite produced from nitrate by lactobacilli may constitute a potential antimicrobial mechanism. studied in a rat acute liver  injury model (adawi et al. 1997). the results indicate that lactobacillus plantarum dsm 9842 may possess nos (adawi et al. 1997). however, no production from l-arginine has not been investigated in pure cultures of l. plantarum. according to the results of a 15n enrichment experiment, traces of (no2-+no3-)-n  (total oxidised nitrogen: ton), which seemed to be formed by the resting cells of lactobacillus fermentum ifo3956, appeared to be derived from l-arginine (morita et al. 1997). therefore, it was suggested that l. fermentum may possess a nos. however, no produced from l-arginine was not directly measured and a nos inhibitor test was not performed by morita et al. (1997). it is known that l-arginine deiminase (adi) in bacteria may convert l-arginine to nh4+ (cunin et al. 1986), which may be further oxidised to ton via nitrification by bacteria. therefore, 15n enrichment experiments could not definitely conclude that l. fermentum possess nos to convert l-arginine directly to no. in this study, six lactobacillus strains belonging to l. plantarum and l. fermentum were measured for no production in mrs broth. the metabolism of nitrate and l-arginine by the lactobacillus cell suspensions was also studied. the possibility that no and nitrite production by lactobacilli may be a potential probiotic trait is also discussed.

TI  == membrane permeabilization in relation to inactivation kinetics of lactobacillus species due to pulsed electric fields.
AB  == membrane permeabilization due to pulsed electric field (pef) treatment of gram-positive lactobacillus cells was investigated by using propidium iodide uptake and single-cell analysis with flow cytometry. electric field strength, energy input, treatment time, and growth phase affected membrane permeabilization of lactobacillus plantarum during pef treatment. a correlation between pef inactivation and membrane permeabilization of l. plantarum cells was demonstrated, whereas no relationship was observed between membrane permeabilization and heat inactivation. the same results were obtained with a lactobacillus fermentum strain, but the latter organism was more pef resistant and exhibited less membrane permeabilization, indicating that various bacteria have different responses to pef treatment. while membrane permeabilization was the main factor involved in the mechanism of inactivation, the growth phase and the acidity of the environment also influenced inactivation. by using flow cytometry it was possible to sort cells in the l. plantarum population based on different cell sizes and shapes, and the results were confirmed by image analysis. an apparent effect of morphology on membrane permeabilization was observed, and larger cells were more easily permeabilized than smaller cells. in  conclusion, our results indicate that the ability of pef treatment to cause membrane permeabilization is an important factor in determining inactivation. this finding should have an effect on the final choice of the processing parameters used so that all microorganisms can be inactivated and, consequently,  on the use of pef treatment as an alternative method for preserving food products.

TI  == lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
AB  == samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. yeasts (20.1%), streptococcus spp. (8.7%), staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. the lactobacillus isolates were l. brevis (24.6%) l. fermentum (18.5%) l. casei (16.9%), l. delbrueckii (15.4%), l. plantarum (9.23%), l. acidophilus (7.69%), l. jensenii (4.62%), l. salivarius (1.54%) and l. gasseri (1.54%). the most common species was l. brevis (24.6%). the strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. all the lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against escherichia coli, salmonella spp., shigella dysenteriae, s. sonnei, klebsiella spp. and campylobacter sp. all the lactobacilli except l. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. the involvement of lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. the ability of lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of intraurethrally administered probiotic lactobacillus casei in a murine model of escherichia coli urinary tract infection.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of the intraurethrally administered probiotic lactobacillus casei strain shirota against escherichia coli in a murine urinary tract infection (uti) model was examined. uti was induced by intraurethral administration of escherichia coli strain hu-1 (a clinical isolate from a uti patient, positive for type 1 and p fimbriae), at a dose of 1 x 10(6) to 2 x 10(6) cfu in 20 microl of saline, into a c3h/hen mouse bladder which had been traumatized with 0.1 n hcl followed immediately by neutralization with 0.1 n naoh 24 h before the challenge infection. chronic infection with the pathogen at 10(6) cfu in the urinary tract (bladder and kidneys) was maintained for more than 3 weeks after the challenge, and the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and myeloperoxidase activity in the urine were markedly elevated during the infection period. a single administration of l. casei shirota at a dose of 10(8) cfu 24 h before the challenge infection dramatically inhibited e. coli growth and inflammatory responses in the urinary tract. multiple daily treatments with l. casei shirota during the postinfection period also showed antimicrobial activity  in this uti model. a heat-killed preparation of l. casei shirota exerted significant antimicrobial effects not only with a single pretreatment (100 microg/mouse) but also with multiple daily treatments during the postinfection period. the other lactobacillus strains tested, i.e., l. fermentum atcc 14931(t), l. jensenii atcc 25258(t), l. plantarum atcc 14917(t), and l. reuteri jcm 1112(t), had no significant antimicrobial activity. taken together, these results suggest that the probiotic l. casei strain shirota is a potent therapeutic agent  for uti.

TI  == characterization of non-starter lactic acid bacteria from italian ewe cheeses based on phenotypic, genotypic, and cell wall protein analyses.
AB  == non-starter lactic acid bacteria (nslab) were isolated from 12 italian ewe cheeses representing six different types of cheese, which in several cases were produced by different manufacturers. a total of 400 presumptive lactobacillus isolates were obtained, and 123 isolates and 10 type strains were subjected to phenotypic, genetic, and cell wall protein characterization analyses. phenotypically, the cheese isolates included 32% lactobacillus plantarum isolates, 15% l. brevis isolates, 12% l. paracasei subsp. paracasei isolates, 9%  l. curvatus isolates, 6% l. fermentum isolates, 6% l. casei subsp. casei isolates, 5% l. pentosus isolates, 3% l. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum isolates, and 1% l. rhamnosus isolates. eleven percent of the isolates were not phenotypically identified. although a randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis based on three primers and clustering by the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic average (upgma) was useful for partially differentiating the 10 type strains, it did not provide a species-specific dna band or a combination of bands which permitted complete separation of all the species considered. in contrast, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis cell wall protein profiles clustered by upgma were species specific and resolved the nslab. the only exceptions were isolates phenotypically identified as l. plantarum and l. pentosus or as l. casei subsp. casei and l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, which were grouped together. based on protein profiles, italian ewe cheeses frequently contained four different species and 3 to 16 strains. in general, the cheeses produced from raw ewe milk contained a larger number of more diverse strains than the cheeses produced from pasteurized  milk. the same cheese produced in different factories contained different species, as well as strains that belonged to the same species but grouped in different rapd clusters.

TI  == phenotypic and molecular identification and clustering of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts from wheat (species triticum durum and triticum aestivum) sourdoughs of southern italy.
AB  == the microflora of 25 wheat sourdoughs from the apulia region, southern italy, was characterized. the sourdoughs were mainly produced from triticum durum wheat. the number of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts ranged from ca. log 7.5 to log 9.3 colony forming units (cfu)/g and from log 5.5 to log 8.4 cfu/g, respectively. about 38% of the 317 isolates of lactic acid bacteria were identified by conventional physiological and biochemical tests. phenotypic identification was confirmed by 16s rdna and 16s/23s rrna spacer region pcr. overall, 30% of the isolates were identified as lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, 20% as lb. alimentarius, 14% as lb. brevis, 12% as leuconostoc citreum, 7% as lb. plantarum, 6% as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, 4% as lb. fermentum and lb. acidophilus,  2% as weissella confusa and 1% as lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii. some of these species have not been previously isolated from sourdoughs. since bakers yeast is widely used in sourdough production, saccharomyces cerevisiae was largely found. the phenotypical relationships within the main lactic acid bacteria identified were established by using cluster analysis. a microbial map of the 25 sourdoughs was plotted showing characteristic associations among lactic acid bacteria and differences in the lactic acid bacteria species which were mainly due to the species of wheat flour, use of bakers yeast and type of bread.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria constituting the predominating microflora  in an acid-fermented condiment (tempoyak) popular in malaysia.
AB  == tempoyak is a traditional malaysian fermented condiment made from the pulp of the durian fruit (durio zibethinus). salt is sometime added to proceed fermentation at ambient temperature. in various samples obtained from night markets, lactic acid bacteria (lab) were the predominant microorganisms, ranging from log 8.4 to  log 9.2 cfu g(-1). no other microorganisms were present to such a level. these samples contained reduced amount of saccharose, glucose and fructose but increased amount of d- and l-lactic acid and acetic acid compared with samples of non-fermented durian fruit. sixty-four isolates of lab were divided into five groups by use of a few phenotypic tests. a total of 38 strains of lab were selected for comparison by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) of their whole cell protein patterns with a sds-page database of lab. these strains were also examined for their carbohydrate fermentation patterns by use of api 50 ch. isolates belonging to the lactobacillus plantarum group were shown to be the predominant members of the lab flora. in addition, isolates belonging to the lactobacillus brevis group, leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus mali, lactobacilus fermentum and an unidentified lactobacillus sp. were also observed. a high degree of diversity among isolates belonging to the lb. plantarum group was demonstrated by analysis  of their plasmid profiles.

TI  == rapid pcr-based procedure to identify lactic acid bacteria: application to six common lactobacillus species.
AB  == the goal of this study was to develop a method allowing rapid identification of the lactic acid bacteria strains in use in the laboratory (lactobacillus plantarum ncimb8826; l. fermentum kld; l. reuteri 100-23; l. salivarius ucc43321; l. paracasei lbtgs1.4; l. casei atcc393), based on pcr amplification of 16s rna coding sequences. first, specific forward oligonucleotides were designed in the variable regions of 16s rna coding sequences of six lactobacillus strains. the reverse oligonucleotide was designed in the region where the sequences were homologous for the six strains. the expected size of the amplification product was +/-1000 bp. the specificity of the method was tested on total chromosomal dna. for five out of the six strains, the amplification of the fragment was strain-specific and the method was directly applicable to colonies. for the strain l. casei atcc393, an additional argument to the classification of this bacteria in the paracasei group could be proposed. validation of the developed method was performed by applying it to six lactobacillus reference strains and to various species of bacteria.

TI  == reduction of fecal shedding of enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 in lambs by feeding microbial feed supplement.
AB  == enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7, an emerging food-borne pathogen, has  been implicated in several outbreaks in the us. ruminants, including cattle, sheep and deer are reservoirs of e. coli o157:h7 and fecal shedding of the pathogen forms the vehicle of entry into the human food chain. we studied the efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus faecium, a mixture of l. acidophilus and s. faecium and a mixture of l. acidophilus, s. faecium, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus plantarum in reducing fecal shedding of e. coli o157:h7 by sheep experimentally infected with  the pathogen prior to administration with the microbials. following oral inoculation with 10(10)cfu of e. coli o157:h7, 30 suffolk ram lambs were blocked  by body weight (six blocks of five lambs each) and lambs within the block randomly assigned to five groups. the lamb groups were fed daily for 7 weeks a basal diet without microbial supplement (control) or the basal diet with l. acidophilus or with s. faecium or with a mixture of l. acidophilus and s. faecium or with a mixture of l. acidophilus, s. faecium, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. plantarum. the microbial supplements contained stabilized live naturally occurring bacteria and were mixed with the diet at the rate of 6.0x10(6)cfu per kilogram of diet. fecal samples were collected weekly and analyzed for e. coli o157:h7 using modified tryptic soy broth with novobiocin as a pre-enrichement broth and cefixim-tellurite sorbitol macconkey agar (ct-smac) as a selective media. e. coli o157:h7 was confirmed by its reaction with o157 and h7 antisera. e. coli o157:h7 was shed continuously and in varying numbers in the feces throughout the 7-week experimental period by all five groups. however, lambs administered a mixture of l. acidophilus, s. faecium, l. casei, l. fermentum and  l. plantarum shed significantly lower (p=0.0211) average number of e. coli o157:h7 (2.3log(10)cfu per gram of feces per week) than the other lamb groups over the entire experimental period. s. faecium supplemented lambs were comparable (p=0.0884) to lambs fed a mixture of l. acidophulus and s. faecium in  fecal shedding of the pathogen (3.5 versus 4.4log(10)cfu per gram of feces) but significantly lower (p=0.0001) than the control lambs (5.6log(10)cfu per gram of  feces) and those supplemented with l. acidophilus (5.5log(10)cfu per gram of feces). average daily gain (adg) and gain to feed ratio (g:f) were significantly  improved (p=0.0145) by the mixed culture microbials (163.0g and 0.33 for the control, 186.4g and 0.37 for l. acidophulus, 168.2g and 0.36 for s. faecium, 213.6g and 0.46 for l. acidophulus and s. faecium, and 219.1g and 0.44, respectively for l. acidophilus, s. faecium, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. plantarum supplemented lambs. the study indicates that supplementing lambs infected with e. coli o157:h7 with s. faecium or a mixture of s. faecium, l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. plantarum in the diet can reduce total number of e. coli o157:h7 shed in the feces and improve animal meat production performance as well.

TI  == decarboxylation of substituted cinnamic acids by lactic acid bacteria isolated during malt whisky fermentation.
AB  == seven strains of lactobacillus isolated from malt whisky fermentations and representing lactobacillus brevis, l. crispatus, l. fermentum, l. hilgardii, l. paracasei, l. pentosus, and l. plantarum contained genes for hydroxycinnamic acid (p-coumaric acid) decarboxylase. with the exception of l. hilgardii, these bacteria decarboxylated p-coumaric acid and/or ferulic acid, with the production  of 4-vinylphenol and/or 4-vinylguaiacol, respectively, although the relative activities on the two substrates varied between strains. the addition of p-coumaric acid or ferulic acid to cultures of l. pentosus in mrs broth induced hydroxycinnamic acid decarboxylase mrna within 5 min, and the gene was also induced by the indigenous components of malt wort. in a simulated distillery fermentation, a mixed culture of l. crispatus and l. pentosus in the presence of  saccharomyces cerevisiae decarboxylated added p-coumaric acid more rapidly than the yeast alone but had little activity on added ferulic acid. moreover, we were  able to demonstrate the induction of hydroxycinnamic acid decarboxylase mrna under these conditions. however, in fermentations with no additional hydroxycinnamic acid, the bacteria lowered the final concentration of 4-vinylphenol in the fermented wort compared to the level seen in a pure-yeast fermentation. it seems likely that the combined activities of bacteria and yeast  decarboxylate p-coumaric acid and then reduce 4-vinylphenol to 4-ethylphenol more effectively than either microorganism alone in pure cultures. although we have shown that lactobacilli participate in the metabolism of phenolic compounds during malt whisky fermentations, the net result is a reduction in the concentrations of 4-vinylphenol and 4-vinylguaiacol prior to distillation.

TI  == urea hydrogen peroxide reduces the numbers of lactobacilli, nourishes yeast, and  leaves no residues in the ethanol fermentation.
AB  == urea hydrogen peroxide (uhp) at a concentration of 30 to 32 mmol/liter reduced the numbers of five lactobacillus spp. (lactobacillus plantarum, l. paracasei, lactobacillus sp. strain 3, l. rhamnosus, and l. fermentum) from approximately 10(7) to approximately 10(2) cfu/ml in a 2-h preincubation at 30 degrees c of normal-gravity wheat mash at approximately 21 g of dissolved solids per ml containing normal levels of suspended grain particles. fermentation was completed 36 h after inoculation of saccharomyces cerevisiae in the presence of uhp, even when wheat mash was deliberately contaminated (infected) with l. paracasei at approximately 10(7) cfu/ml. there were no significant differences in the maximum  ethanol produced between treatments when urea hydrogen peroxide was used to kill  the bacteria and controls (in which no bacteria were added). however, the presence of l. paracasei at approximately 10(7) cfu/ml without added agent resulted in a 5.84% reduction in the maximum ethanol produced compared to the control. the bactericidal activity of uhp is greatly affected by the presence of  particulate matter. in fact, only 2 mmol of urea hydrogen peroxide per liter was  required for disinfection when mashes had little or no particulate matter present. no significant differences were observed in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in normal-gravity wheat mash at 30 degrees c whether the bactericidal agent was added as h(2)o(2) or as urea hydrogen peroxide. nadh peroxidase activity (involved in degrading h(2)o(2)) increased significantly (p = 0.05) in the presence of 0.75 mm hydrogen peroxide (sublethal level) in all five  strains of lactobacilli tested but did not persist in cells regrown in the absence of h(2)o(2). h(2)o(2)-resistant mutants were not expected or found when lethal levels of h(2)o(2) or uhp were used. contaminating lactobacilli can be effectively managed by uhp, a compound which when used at ca. 30 mmol/liter happens to provide near-optimum levels of assimilable nitrogen and oxygen that aid in vigorous fermentation performance by yeast.

TI  == microbial community dynamics during production of the mexican fermented maize dough pozol.
AB  == the dynamics of the microbial community responsible for the traditional fermentation of maize in the production of mexican pozol was investigated by using a polyphasic approach combining (i) microbial enumerations with culture media, (ii) denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) fingerprinting of total community dna with bacterial and eukaryotic primers and sequencing of partial 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) genes, (iii) quantification of rrnas from dominant microbial taxa by using phylogenetic oligonucleotide probes, and (iv) analysis of sugars and fermentation products. a streptococcus species dominated the fermentation and accounted for between 25 and 75% of the total flora throughout the process. results also showed that the initial epiphytic aerobic microflora was replaced in the first 2 days by heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria (lab), including a close relative of lactobacillus fermentum, producing  lactic acid and ethanol; this heterolactic flora was then progressively replaced  by homofermentative lab (mainly close relatives of l. plantarum, l. casei, and l. delbrueckii) which continued acidification of the maize dough. at the same time,  a very diverse community of yeasts and fungi developed, mainly at the periphery of the dough. the analysis of the dgge patterns obtained with bacterial and eukaryotic primers targeting the 16s and 18s rdna genes clearly demonstrated that there was a major shift in the community structure after 24 h and that high biodiversity-according to the shannon-weaver index-was maintained throughout the  process. these results proved that a relatively high number of species, at least  six to eight, are needed to perform this traditional lactic acid fermentation. the presence of bifidobacterium, enterococcus, and enterobacteria suggests a fecal origin of some important pozol microorganisms. overall, the results obtained with different culture-dependent or -independent techniques clearly confirmed the importance of developing a polyphasic approach to study the ecology of fermented foods.

TI  == molecular diversity of lactic acid bacteria from cassava sour starch (colombia).
AB  == lactic acid bacteria and more particularly lactobacilli and leuconostoc, are widely found in a wide variety of traditional fermented foods of tropical countries, made with cereals, tubers, meat or fish. these products represent a source of bacterial diversity that cannot be accurately analysed using classical  phenotypic and biochemical tests. in the present work, the identification and the molecular diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from cassava sour starch fermentation were assessed by using a combination of complementary molecular methods: randomly amplified polymorphic dna fingerprinting (rapd), plasmid profiling, hybridization using rrna phylogenetic probes and partial 16s rdna sequencing. the results revealed a large diversity of bacterial species (lb. manihotivorans, lb. plantarum, lb. casei, lb. hilgardii, lb. buchneri, lb. fermentum, ln. mesenteroides and pediococcus sp.). however, the most frequently isolated species were lb. plantarum and lb. manihotivorans. the rapd analysis revealed a large molecular diversity between lb. manihotivorans or lb. plantarum  strains. these results, observed on a rather limited number of samples, reveal that significant bacterial diversity is generated in traditional cassava sour starch fermentations. we propose that the presence of the amylolytic lb. manihotivorans strains could have a role in sour starch processing.

TI  == [cloning and gene expression in lactic acid bacteria].
AB  == the possibility of using the genera lactobacillus and lactococcus as vector representatives is widely discussed at present. the prospects of the construction of recombinant bacteria are closely connected with the solution of a number of problems: the level of the transcription of cloned genes, the effectiveness of the translation of heterologous mrna, the stability of protein with respect to bacterial intracellular proteases, the method by protein molecules leave the cell (by secretion or as the result of lysis). to prevent segregation instability, the construction of vector molecules on the basis of stable cryptic plasmids found in wild strains of lactic acid bacteria was proposed. high copying plasmids with low molecular weight were detected in l. plantarum and l. pentosus strains. several plasmids with molecular weights of 1.7, 1.8 and 2.3 kb were isolated from bacterial cells to be used as the basis for the construction of vector molecules. genes of chloramphenicol- and erythromycin-resistance from staphylococcus aureus  plasmids were used as marker genes ensuring cell transformation. the vector plasmids thus constructed exhibited high transformation activity in the electroporation of different strains, including l. casei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum and l. brevis which could be classified with the replicons of a wide circle of hosts. but the use of these plasmids was limited due to the risk of the uncontrolled dissemination of recombinant plasmids. l. acidophilus were also found to have strictly specific plasmids with good prospects of being used as the basis for the creation of vectors, incapable of dissemination. in addition to the search of strain-specific plasmids, incapable of uncontrolled gene transmission, the use of chromosome-integrated heterologous  genes is recommended in cloning to ensure the maximum safety.

AB  == the spectrum of the antibiotic resistance of 21 strains of normal microflora, mainly forming constituents of widely used probiotics to 25 antibacterial preparations. lactobacillus spp. were prevalent in the strains under test. the spectrum of the antibiotic resistance of lactobacilli varied, the gradation of resistance being more pronounced with respect to strains and not species. both highly sensitive and highly resistant lactobacillus strains were found: l. acidophilus (a component of biopreparation "linex"), l. plantarum 8ra3, l. fermentum 90t4c (probiotic "lactobacterin"), l. fermentum bl96. bacteria used as  the components of combined preparation "linex" exhibited the highest resistance to a number of modern antibiotics. strains of bifidobacteria were found to be highly sensitive to antibiotics.

TI  == arabinose fermentation by lactobacillus plantarum in sourdough with added pentosans and alphaalpha-l-arabinofuranosidase: a tool to increase the production of acetic acid.
AB  == sixty-five strains of obligately and facultatively heterofermentative sourdough lactic acid bacteria were screened for their capacity to grow optimally in the presence of arabinose, ribose and xylose as carbon sources. lactobacillus alimentarius 15f, lact. brevis 10a, lact. fermentum 1f and lact. plantarum 20b showed higher growth rate, cell yield, acidification rate and production of acetic acid when some pentoses instead of maltose were added to the sdb medium. lactobacillus plantarum 20b used arabinose also in a synthetic medium where complex growth factors such as yeast extract were omitted. other lact. plantarum  strains did not show the same property. pentosan extract was treated with alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase from aspergillus niger or endo-xylanase from bacillus subtilis to produce hydrolysates containing mainly arabinose and xylose, respectively. in particular, the hydrolysate containing arabinose substantiated the growth and the production of lactic acid and, especially, of acetic acid by lact. plantarum 20b. sourdough fermentation by lact. plantarum 20b with addition  of pentosan extract and alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase increased the acidification rate, titratable acidity and acetic acid content compared with traditional sourdough. a facultatively heterofermentative strain, lact. plantarum 20b, also produced a sourdough with an optimal fermentation quotient.

TI  == polyphasic study of the spatial distribution of microorganisms in mexican pozol,  a fermented maize dough, demonstrates the need for cultivation-independent methods to investigate traditional fermentations.
AB  == the distribution of microorganisms in pozol balls, a fermented maize dough, was investigated by a polyphasic approach in which we used both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods, including microbial enumeration, fermentation product analysis, quantification of microbial taxa with 16s rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes, determination of microbial fingerprints by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), and 16s ribosomal dna gene sequencing. our results demonstrate that dgge fingerprinting and rrna quantification should allow workers to precisely and rapidly characterize the microbial assemblage in a spontaneous lactic acid fermented food. lactic acid bacteria (lab) accounted for  90 to 97% of the total active microflora; no streptococci were isolated, although members of the genus streptococcus accounted for 25 to 50% of the microflora. lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus fermentum, together with members of the genera leuconostoc and weissella, were the other dominant organisms. the overall  activity was more important at the periphery of a ball, where eucaryotes, enterobacteria, and bacterial exopolysacharide producers developed. our results also showed that the metabolism of heterofermentative lab was influenced in situ  by the distribution of the lab in the pozol ball, whereas homolactic fermentation was controlled primarily by sugar limitation. we propose that starch is first degraded by amylases from lab and that the resulting sugars, together with the lactate produced, allow a secondary flora to develop in the presence of oxygen. our results strongly suggest that cultivation-independent methods should be used  to study traditional fermented foods.

TI  == collagen (cn-i) binding by gut lactobacilli.
AB  == four gut lactobacillus strains displaying the features which make them particularly promising for the preparation of probiotic products were investigated together with 5 fresh isolates and one collection strain of lactobacillus plantarum for their ability to bind type i collagen (cn-i). immobilised cn-i in microtitre plates was bound only by 3 strains of gut lactobacilli from piglets and the collection strain lactobacillus plantarum lhi 10 from prague in range of a570nm readings 0.114-0.221. six strains (isolates from turkeys and a calf) did not bind cn-i (a570nm < 0.1) in this assay. an influence of cultivation medium on cn-i binding was significant (p < 0.001) in all four adherent strains. significantly higher (p < 0.001) binding of cn-i was observed for lactobacillus casei l 81 and lactobacillus plantarum lhi 10 grown on solid medium (mrs agar) than for mrs broth-grown cells, however, lactobacillus plantarum l 5 and lactobacillus fermentum l 435 expressed significantly (p < 0.001) higher cn-i binding during cultivation in mrs broth. the specificity of the binding was confirmed because the cn-i binding by lactobacilli after their preincubation with this protein was completely abolished. three selected inhibitors (fucoidan, heparan sulphate and hyaluronic acid) significantly (p < 0.001) reduced cn-i binding by the lactobacillus plantarum l 5 strain. following  up on some earlier strain characteristics, these results suggest that the selected piglets lactobacilli are also able to bind cn-i and therefore should antagonize collagen niche colonization by various enteropathogens when used for probiotic purposes.

TI  == antagonistic activity of bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus species from ogi,  an indigenous fermented food.
AB  == seven lactobacillus species each with one or more strains were isolated from various fermented cereal gruel's (ogi). they were identified as l. plantarum (3 strains), l. delbrueckii (1 strain), l. brevis (2 strains), l. reuteri (2 strains), l. casei (1 strain), l. fermentum (1 strain) and l. acidophilus (1 strain). bacteriocin production was observed in cell-free supernatants of 8 of these strains with l. fermentum, l. delbrueckii and l. reuteri strains (white maize ogi) being negative. the bacteriocin produced by the eight strains inhibited the growth of various target organisms with the inhibition strongly noticed using enterococcus faecalis as indicator. while catalase treatment, ph changes and heat treatment up to 80 degrees c had no effect on the activity of bacteriocin from these isolates, treatment with trypsin and proteinase k resulted in complete loss of inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins. a reduction in the inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins was also found to occur with increasing concentrations of glucose or peptone in the cultivation medium.

AB  == forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.

TI  == effects of lactobacilli on yeast-catalyzed ethanol fermentations.
AB  == normal-gravity (22 to 24 degrees plato) wheat mashes were inoculated with five industrially important strains of lactobacilli at approximately 10(5), approximately 10(6), approximately 10(7), approximately 10(8), and approximately  10(9) cfu/ml in order to study the effects of the lactobacilli on yeast growth and ethanol productivity. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus #3, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus fermentum were used. controls with yeast cells but no bacterial inoculation and additional treatments  with bacteria alone inoculated at approximately 10(7) cfu/ml of mash were included. decreased ethanol yields were due to the diversion of carbohydrates for bacterial growth and the production of lactic acid. as higher numbers of the bacteria were produced (depending on the strain), 1 to 1.5% (wt/vol) lactic acid  resulted in the case of homofermentative organisms. l. fermentum, a heterofermentative organism, produced only 0.5% (wt/vol) lactic acid. when l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, and l. fermentum were inoculated at approximately 10(6)  cfu/ml, an approximately 2% decrease in the final ethanol concentration was observed. smaller initial numbers (only 10(5) cfu/ml) of l. paracasei or lactobacillus #3 were sufficient to cause more than 2% decreases in the final ethanol concentrations measured compared to the control. such effects after an inoculation of only 10(5) cfu/ml may have been due to the higher tolerance to ethanol of the latter two bacteria, to the more rapid adaptation (shorter lag phase) of these two industrial organisms to fermentation conditions, and/or to their more rapid growth and metabolism. when up to 10(9) cfu of bacteria/ml was present in mash, approximately 3.8 to 7.6% reductions in ethanol concentration occurred depending on the strain. production of lactic acid and a suspected competition with yeast cells for essential growth factors in the fermenting medium were the major reasons for reductions in yeast growth and final ethanol yield when lactic acid bacteria were present.

TI  == electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases, a new tool for bacterial species identification: application to 10 lactobacillus species.
AB  == lactobacilli have been used as industrial starters for a long time, but in many cases their phenotypic identification is still neither easy nor reliable. previously we observed that the cell wall peptidoglycan hydrolases of lactobacillus helveticus were highly conserved enzymes; the aim of the present work was to determine whether peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns obtained by renaturing sds-page could be of interest in the identification of lactobacilli species. for that purpose, the peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns of 94 strains of  lactobacilli belonging to 10 different species were determined; most of the species studied are used either in dairy, meat, bakery or vegetable fermentations: l. helveticus, l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii, l. brevis, l. fermentum, l. jensenii, l. plantarum, l. sake, l. curvatus and l. reuteri. within a species, the strains exhibited highly similar patterns: the apparent molecular  weights of the lytic bands were identical, with only slight variations of intensity. moreover, each species, including phylogenetically close species such  as l. sake and l. curvatus, or l. acidophilus and l. helveticus, gave a different pattern. interestingly, the closer the species were phylogenetically, the more related were their patterns. the sensitivity of the method was checked using various quantities of l. acidophilus cells: a peptidoglycan hydrolase extract of  5 x 10(6) cells was sufficient to obtain an informative pattern, as was a single  colony. finally, the method was also successfully applied to distinguish two carnobacterium species. in conclusion, the electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases is proposed as a new tool for lactobacilli identification: it is rapid, sensitive and effective even for phylogenetically close species. furthermore, this work provides the first evidence of the potential overall taxonomic value of bacterial peptidoglycan hydrolases.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus supplementation with and without arginine on liver damage and bacterial translocation in an acute liver injury model in the rat.
AB  == in acute liver failure following hepatitis, toxic insults, or after major liver surgery, there is an increased bacterial translocation from the gut. this may explain some of the infectious complications seen in these conditions. to elucidate mechanisms and find possible preventive measures, we investigated the effect of rectal administration of arginine and probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus spp.) on bacterial translocation and the extent of liver failure. sprague-dawley  rats were used and five different lactobacillus strains (lb. reuteri r2lc, lb. rhamnosus dsm 6594 (= strain 271), lb. plantarum dsm 9843 (= strain 299v), lb. fermentum 8704:3 (= strain 245), and lb. reuteri (= strain 108) were administered rectally once daily for 8 days with and without 2% arginine. acute liver injury (ali) was induced on the eighth day by intraperitoneal injection of d-galactosamine (1.1 g/kg body weight), and samples were collected after 24 and 48 hours. bacterial translocation was evaluated by bacterial culture from portal  and arterial blood, mesenteric lymph nodes, and liver tissue. liver enzymes and bilirubin were evaluated in the serum. the bacterial load in the cecum and colon  was determined and the liver histopathological changes were studied. there was no mortality at any time. the liver enzymes and bilirubin decreased in some of the groups supplemented with lactobacilli with and without arginine compared with the ali control group. the incidence of bacterial translocation and the number of the translocated bacteria decreased significantly in some of the supplemented groups. lb. plantarum + arginine administration significantly reduced the level of the released liver enzymes, hepatocellular necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration, bacterial translocation, and the number of enterobacteriaceae in the cecum and colon. rectal administration of different lactobacillus strains with and without arginine in an ali model significantly modulates the extent of the liver failure and reduces bacterial translocation. lb. plantarum dsm 9843 (=  strain 299v) with or without arginine seemed superior to the other lactobacillus  strains. the beneficial effect of arginine administration alone indicates a possible role of nitric oxide and polyamines in this process, and the lactobacilli may execute their action via the same mechanisms or via bacterial antagonism and/or enhancement of systemic and intestinal mucosal immunity.

TI  == pathogenic potential of lactobacilli.
AB  == lactobacilli are often considered to be commensal or beneficial participants in human microbial ecology and considerable research is being carried out into the effects of the use of lactobacilli as additives in both human and animal diets. however, lactobacilli also cause some human diseases (e.g. dental caries, rheumatic vascular disease, septicaemia and infective endocarditis (ie)), and have recently been identified as potential emerging pathogens in elderly and immunocompromised patients, particularly those receiving broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. the identification of potential pathogenic traits amongst lactobacilli will therefore facilitate the use of the organisms for probiotic purposes. the ability to aggregate human platelets is considered to be a possible pathogenic trait in the progression of ie. a comparison of bacterial cell surface properties amongst l. rhamnosus strains showed that platelets were aggregated by  5/5 ie strains and 8/16 laboratory strains. for the l. paracasei subsp. paracasei strains the respective numbers were 2/5 and 2/9. however two strains, morphological mutants of a non-aggregating strain, which had been re-isolated after passaging through rats were found to aggregate platelets. no loss of aggregating function occurred on extensive subculturing of ie strains. aggregation also occurred with 11/14 strains for five other species, namely, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus oris, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus salvivarius, with each species being represented indicating that the property is not uncommon in the genus. a comparison of ie and oral isolates of l. rhamnosus and l. paracasei subsp. paracasei and seven other lactobacillus species, has shown that the binding of both fibronectin and fibrinogen by lactobacilli is greatly increased, up to 50 fold, when the ph is reduced from 7.0 to 5.0. re-exposing the lactobacilli to a neutral ph environment releases most of the bound proteins, but the amount still  remaining bound to the cell is several times more than is bound at neutral ph. lactobacilli will also bind to the proteins that make up the extracellular matrix of endothelial cells. lactobacilli bound significantly better to collagen types i and v than to types iii and iv (p < 0.01). further, strains isolated from ie cases, particularly l. rhamnosus strains, bound significantly better to types i and v than did 'normal' strains (p < 0.02). type v collagen has been demonstrated at the sites of endothelial damage. thus the binding of lactobacilli, particularly l. rhamnosus to these collagen types may be of importance in the early stages of colonization of the damaged heart valve.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == the ability to aggregate human platelets was examined for five lactobacillus rhamnosus strains and five lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei strains isolated from patients with infective endocarditis (ie), 25 laboratory isolates from the same two species, and 14 strains from five other oral species, namely lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus oris, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus salivarius. amongst the l. rhamnosus strains, platelets were aggregated by all five ie strains and 8/16 laboratory strains. for the l. paracasei subsp. paracasei strains, the respective numbers were 2/5 and 2/9. aggregation also occurred with 11/14 strains of the other five  species; each species was represented. the optimal ratio of bacteria to platelets for aggregation was approximately 1:1, and there was considerable variation in the lag phase that preceded aggregation, depending on the source of the platelets. overall, the lag phase varied between 0.25 +/- 0.1 and 20.4 +/- 3.2 min and the percentage aggregation ranged between 70 +/- 2.6 and 104 +/- 13.5%. confirmation that aggregation was being observed came from studies with five strains on the inhibitory effects of edta, dipyridamole, apyrase, imipramine, acetylsalicylic acid and quinacrine. inhibition of aggregation by l. rhamnosus strains by the peptide arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-serine (rgds) further indicated a role for fibronectin and/or fibrinogen. pronase treatment of cells for 1 h and extraction of bacterial surface components with 0.1 m-tris/hcl (ph 8.5) at 37 degrees c for 1 h stopped aggregation in 8/9 ie strains. extracted surface proteins (200 micrograms) completely inhibited platelet aggregation by 8/9 of the homologous strains.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == characterization and frequency distribution of species of lactic acid bacteria involved in the processing of mawe, a fermented maize dough from benin.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria involved in the natural fermentation of both home-produced and commercial mawe were investigated during a 72 h fermentation period. lactobacillus spp. constitute the majority (94%) of the strains of the lactic acid bacteria isolated, among which 89% represent the betabacterium group. they include l. fermentum (biotype cellobiosus) (41%), l. fermentum or l. reuteri (19%), l. brevis (26%), l. confusus (less than 2%), l. curvatus (less than 1%) and l. buchneri (less than 1%). other isolated lactic acid bacteria were l. salivarius, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus pentosaceus, pediococcus acidilactici and leuconostoc mesenteroides. several species were detected at the early stage of fermentation, but the final stage was dominated by l. fermentum (biotype cellobiosus) and l. fermentum or l. reuteri totalling 90% of the isolated strains. the trend was the same for both home-produced and commercial mawe. no strains of l. plantarum, generally reported as dominating lactic acid bacteria at the final stage of fermentation of most plant foods, were isolated.

TI  == [biological characteristics of strains of lactobacilli, promising for use as eubiotics].
AB  == in the course of in vitro studies 3 lactobacillus strains with pronounced antagonistic activity against some pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria (shigellae, enteropathogenic escherichia, proteus, staphylococci) were selected.  in experiments on germ-free rats faint colonization by l. plantarum 37 was observed in the small intestine, as well as in the large intestine when low doses of these bacilli were introduced into the gastrointestinal tract of the animals.  in vitro experiments demonstrated the decreased growth rate of this strain. the prophylactic administration of two eubiotic strains, l. plantarum 37 and l. fermentum 39, simultaneously with chloramphenicol to primates inhibited the growth of opportunistic bacteria, though l. fermentum 39 excessively suppressed the content of escherichia coli in the enterobacterial population. the optimum biological effect was achieved with the therapeutic use of these three strains for the correction of dysbiotic disturbances caused by the administration of tetracycline in volunteers.

TI  == single-stranded dna plasmid, vector construction and cloning of bacillus stearothermophilus alpha-amylase in lactobacillus.
AB  == vector plasmids were constructed by ligating chloramphenicol and erythromycin resistance genes to taqi-digested dna of a cryptic plasmid from lactobacillus plantarum. the minimal region of lactobacillus plasmid dna that was required for  dna replication was defined and a single-stranded dna intermediate replication system was observed. homologies with other origins of replication of plasmids from gram-positive bacteria, replicating via rolling circle mechanism, were found. it was shown that the constructed vectors, named ppsc20 and ppsc22, were transformable into l. plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli. using plasmid ppsc22, the alpha-amylase gene of bacillus stearothermophilus was cloned and expressed in several lactobacillus species.

TI  == incompatibility of lactobacillus vectors with replicons derived from small cryptic lactobacillus plasmids and segregational instability of the introduced vectors.
AB  == three new lactobacillus vectors based on cryptic lactobacillus plasmids were constructed. the shuttle vector plp3537 consists of a 2.3-kb plasmid from lactobacillus pentosus md353, an erythromycin resistance gene from staphylococcus aureus plasmid pe194, and puc19 as a replicon for escherichia coli. the vectors plpe317 and plpe323, which do not contain e. coli sequences, were generated by introducing the erythromycin resistance gene of pe194 into a 1.7- and a 2.3-kb plasmid from l. pentosus md353, respectively. these vectors and the shuttle vector plp825 (m. posno, r. j. leer, j. m. m. van rijn, b. c. lokman, and p. h. pouwels, p. 397-401, in a. t. ganesan and j. a. hoch, ed., genetics and biotechnology of bacilli, vol. 2, 1988) could be introduced by electroporation into lactobacillus casei, l. pentosus, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, and l. brevis strains with similar efficiencies. transformation efficiencies were strain dependent and varied from 10 to 10 transformants per mug of dna. plasmid dna analysis of l. pentosus md353 transformants revealed that the introduction of plp3537 or plpe323 was invariably accompanied by loss of the endogenous 2.3-kb plasmid. remarkably, plpe317 could only be introduced into an l. pentosus md353 strain that had been previously cured of its endogenous 1.7-kb  plasmid. the curing phenomena are most likely to be explained by the incompatibility of the vectors and resident plasmids. lactobacillus vectors are generally rapidly lost when cells are cultivated in the absence of selective pressure. however, plpe323 is stable in three of four lactobacillus strains tested so far.

TI  == superoxide dismutase activity in some strains of lactobacilli: induction by manganese.
AB  == dialyzed cell-free extract of lactobacilli was found to contain superoxide dismutase activity by using a test system in which superoxide ion is generated by xanthine oxidase. the specific activities of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus murinus atcc 35020, lactobacillus acidophilus crl 358, lactobacillus plantarum atcc 8014, lactobacillus casei crl 431, lactobacillus plantarum crl 353, lactobacillus fermentum atcc 9338, lactobacillus buchneri ncdo 110, and lactobacillus fermentum crl 251 were between 0.06 and 0.43 u/mg protein. the presence of superoxide dismutase activity was demonstrated when the strains were grown in media containing mn2+ ions. superoxide dismutase of lactobacilli may be an mn enzyme since it was not inhibited by either cyanide or azide ions. however, the cell-free extract of lactobacillus murinus atcc 35020 contains superoxide dismutase activity sensitive to both ions.

TI  == the effect of ph on the sensitivity of species of lactobacillus to chlorhexidine  and the antibiotics minocycline and spiramycin.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity of a range of lactobacillus species to chlorhexidine, minocycline, and spiramycin, at a range of ph from 5.0 to 7.4. strains of streptococcus were also tested for their sensitivity to chlorhexidine, as a comparison between the genera. there were both inter- and intra-species variations in the sensitivity of these strains to chlorhexidine. the strains tested were sensitive at ph 6.7 to the following levels of chlorhexidine (micrograms/ml): l. casei (6 strains), 10-60; l. plantarum (4 strains), 40; l. fermentum (13 strains), 2-20; l. brevis (1 strain), 10; and l. acidophilus (3 strains), 10-60. the streptococcus species were sensitive to 1-4 micrograms/ml (13 strains); 4-10 micrograms/ml (3 strains); and  10-20 micrograms/ml (2 strains). one strain was able to survive 20 micrograms/ml. chlorhexidine was found to be less effective at lower ph levels. the following examples show sensitivity (micrograms/ml) at ph 6.5 followed by sensitivity at ph 5.0: l. casei (atcc 15008), 40,60; l. plantarum (ch 374), 40,100; l. fermentum (ch 324) 10,40; l. acidophilus (atcc 4356), 10,40; and s. mutans (bm 52), 2,2. all of the strains of lactobacillus tested with spiramycin were resistant at ph 5.0. minocycline was less affected by changes in ph, but at ph 7.4 lactobacillus  strains were more resistant to minocycline as compared with spiramycin. both of these antibiotics are bacteriostatic, and therefore may have a more limited effect than a bactericidal agent such as chlorhexidine. the lactobacillus strains tested required higher concentrations of chlorhexidine than did the strains of streptococcus for a killing effect in vitro.

TI  == nucleic acids of species of lactobacillus.
AB  == nucleic acid composition of 17 cultures representing the type or neotype strains  of 15 named lactobacillus species was studied. nucleic acid characterization of these isolates was accompanied by a comparative study of conventional phenotypic  reactions. the overall guanine plus cytosine mean deoxyribonucleic acid base composition ranged from 33 to 50% and genome sizes varied between 700 and 1500 x  10(6) daltons. sporolactobacillus inulinus contained 2500 x 10(6) daltons of chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid and was therefore similar in size to members of the genus bacillus. deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization at a temperature 15 degrees c below the thermal melting temperature confirmed the extreme molecular heterogeneity of many species. the genus can be divided into three major groups,  each containing four or more species based on a combination of nucleic acid characteristics and conventional phenotypic reactions. group i (33 to 39% guanine plus cytosine) contains lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus helveticus nov. ssp. jugurt, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus sanfrancisco. group ii (42 to 48% guanine plus cytosine contains lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus brevis, and group iii (48 to 50% guanine plus cytosine) contains lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. leichmanii, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus fermentum nov. ssp. cellobiosis.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.

AB  == the reassembly of tetragonally arranged subunits in the cell wall of lactobacillus brevis and the reattachment of the subunits to cell wall fragments  were investigated by electron microscopy. the subunits dissociated from the cell  wall with guanidine hydrochloride (ghcl) reassembled into the same regular array  as seen in native cell wall after dialysis against neutral buffer even in the absence of specific cations. the subunits could also reattach to the cell wall fragments from which they had been removed by treatment with ghcl, sodium dodecyl sulfate or cold trichloroacetic acid but not to those treated with hot formamide. heterologous reattachment of the subunits occurred on cell wall fragments obtained from l. fermentum but not on those from l plantarum or l. casei subsp. casei. on the basis of these observations and chemical analyses of the cell wall  fragments, the subunits of l. brevis appeared to be bound by hydrogen bonds to a  neutral polysaccharide moiety in the cell wall but not to peptidoglycan or teichoic acid.
