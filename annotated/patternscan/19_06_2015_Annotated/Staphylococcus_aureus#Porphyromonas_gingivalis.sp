TI  == peripheral blood neutrophil cytokine hyper-reactivity in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == pro-inflammatory cytokine release (il-8, il-6, tnf-alpha, il-1beta) by peripheral blood neutrophils, isolated from periodontitis patients (before/after therapy) and matched controls, was determined after 18 h culture in the presence/absence of escherichia coli lps, opsonised staphylococcus aureus, heat-killed fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis. all cultures demonstrated differences in the amounts of each cytokine detected (p < 0.0001), with a clear release pattern (il-8 > il-6 > tnf-alpha = il-1beta). median cytokine release from unstimulated patient neutrophils was consistently, but non-significantly, higher than from control cells. stimulated cytokine release from untreated patient neutrophils was also consistently higher than from control cells. this hyper-reactivity was significant for all tested cytokines when data for all stimuli were combined (p < 0.016). in terms of individual stimuli, significant hyper-reactivity was detected with lps (il-8), f. nucleatum (il-8, tnf-alpha), opsonised s. aureus (il-8, tnf-alpha, il-1beta) and p. gingivalis (il-8, il-1beta). cytokine production by patient neutrophils did not reduce following successful non-surgical periodontal therapy and, except for responses to f. nucleatum, the cytokine hyper-reactivity detected pre-therapy was retained. these data demonstrate that chronic periodontitis is characterised by neutrophils that  constitutively exhibit cytokine hyper-reactivity, the effects of which could modulate local and systemic inflammatory-immune responses and influence the risk  and severity of periodontitis-associated systemic inflammatory diseases.

TI  == antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of phosphoric acid solution compared to other root canal irrigants.
AB  == phosphoric acid has been suggested as an irrigant due to its effectiveness in removing the smear layer. objectives: the purpose of this study was to compare the antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of a 37% phosphoric acid solution to other irrigants commonly used in endodontics. material and methods: the substances 37% phosphoric acid, 17% edta, 10% citric acid, 2% chlorhexidine (solution and gel), and 5.25% naocl were evaluated. the antimicrobial activity was tested against candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, actinomyces meyeri, parvimonas micra, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella nigrescens according to the agar diffusion method. the cytotoxicity of the irrigants was determined by using the mtt assay. results: phosphoric acid presented higher antimicrobial activity compared to the other tested irrigants. with regard to the cell viability, this solution showed results similar to those with 5.25% naocl and 2% chlorhexidine (gel and solution), whereas 17% edta and 10% citric acid showed higher cell viability compared to other irrigants. conclusion: phosphoric acid demonstrated higher antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity similar to that of 5.25% naocl and 2% chlorhexidine (gel and solution).

TI  == platelets and infections - complex interactions with bacteria.
AB  == platelets can be considered sentinels of vascular system due to their high number in the circulation and to the range of functional immunoreceptors they express. platelets express a wide range of potential bacterial receptors, including complement receptors, fcgammarii, toll-like receptors but also integrins conventionally described in the hemostatic response, such as gpiib-iiia or gpib.  bacteria bind these receptors either directly, or indirectly via fibrinogen, fibronectin, the first complement c1q, the von willebrand factor, etc. the fate of platelet-bound bacteria is questioned. several studies reported the ability of activated platelets to internalize bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus or porphyromonas gingivalis, though there is no clue on what happens thereafter. are they sheltered from the immune system in the cytoplasm of platelets or are they lysed? indeed, while the presence of phagolysosome has not been demonstrated in platelets, they contain antimicrobial peptides that were shown to be efficient on s. aureus. besides, the fact that bacteria can bind to platelets via receptors involved in hemostasis suggests that they may induce aggregation; this has indeed been described for streptococcus sanguinis, s. epidermidis, or c. pneumoniae. on  the other hand, platelets are able to display an inflammatory response to an infectious triggering. we, and others, have shown that platelet release soluble immunomodulatory factors upon stimulation by bacterial components. moreover, interactions between bacteria and platelets are not limited to only these two partners. indeed, platelets are also essential for the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps by neutrophils, resulting in bacterial clearance by trapping  bacteria and concentrating antibacterial factors but in enhancing thrombosis. in  conclusion, the platelet-bacteria interplay is a complex game; its fine analysis  is complicated by the fact that the inflammatory component adds to the aggregation response.

TI  == scratching the surface - tobacco-induced bacterial biofilms.
AB  == individual environmental factors, such as iron, temperature and oxygen, are known to have a profound effect on bacterial phenotype. therefore, it is surprising so  little known is about the influence of chemically complex cigarette smoke on bacterial physiology. recent evidence has demonstrated that tobacco smoke and components alter the bacterial surface and promote biofilm formation in several important human pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, klebsiella pneumonia, porphyromonas gingivalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and the relevance to increased susceptibility to infectious disease in smokers and to treatment are reviewed.

TI  == analysis of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and s. aureus levels in edentulous mouths prior to and 6 months after placement of one-piece zirconia and titanium implants.
AB  == background: it has been suggested that completely edentulous patients harbour fewer periodontopathic bacteria compared with dentate patients, due to the removal of the subgingival periodontal environment. however, reappearance of certain microbes has been reported after the placement of implants in these patients. aim: the aim of this study was to determine whether the periodontopathic bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia, as well as the non-periodontopathic bacterium, staphylococcus aureus, emerged in edentulous patients 6 months after placement of one-piece zirconia and titanium implants. materials and methods: twenty-six patients were included in the study (titanium = 13, zirconia = 13). microbial samples were collected from the tongue  prior to implant placement and 6 months after implant placement from both the tongue and from around the implants. a qrt-pcr assay using sybr green/rox chemistry was used for the detection and quantification of rgp, nuc and karilysin single-copy gene of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and s. aureus, respectively. positive controls used in the study were pure bacterial gdna purified from cultures of p. gingivalis and s. aureus, a cloned sequence of the karilysin gene  for t. forsythia, a plaque sample positive for p. gingivalis and t. forsythia, and nasal gdna for s. aureus. results: the results show that prior to implant placement, all three bacterial species were below the lower limit of quantification in all edentulous patients. the samples collected from the tongue  and around the implants remained below the lower limit of quantification for each of the three species. however, all positive controls used in the study were detectable in the samples. qpcr standard curves showed correlation coefficients >0.97 and efficiencies >94.5% (slope range -3.19 to -3.46) for each of the sybr green pcr assays. conclusion: the results of this study indicate that the tested  organisms did not emerge 6 months after implant placement irrespective of the nature of the implant biomaterial. a further follow-up of at least 2 years post-implantation of these patients is suggested to determine whether there are any changes in the oral microbiota and whether such changes are associated with the development of peri-implant disease.

TI  == identification and characterization of an anti-pseudomonal dichlorocarbazol derivative displaying anti-biofilm activity.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant towards all currently available antibiotics are increasingly encountered, raising the need for new anti-pseudomonal drugs. we therefore conducted a medium-throughput screen of a small-molecule collection resulting in the identification of the n-alkylated 3,6-dihalogenocarbazol 1-(sec-butylamino)-3-(3,6-dichloro-9h-carbazol-9-yl)propan-2-ol (mic = 18.5 mug ml(-)(1)). this compound, compound 1, is bacteriostatic towards a broad spectrum  of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, including p. aeruginosa. importantly, 1 also eradicates mature biofilms of p. aeruginosa. 1 displays no cytotoxicity against various human cell types, pointing to its potential for further development as a novel antibacterial drug.

TI  == oral bacterial dna findings in pericardial fluid.
AB  == background: we recently reported that large amounts of oral bacterial dna can be  found in thrombus aspirates of myocardial infarction patients. some case reports  describe bacterial findings in pericardial fluid, mostly done with conventional culturing and a few with pcr; in purulent pericarditis, nevertheless, bacterial pcr has not been used as a diagnostic method before. objective: to find out whether bacterial dna can be measured in the pericardial fluid and if it correlates with pathologic-anatomic findings linked to cardiovascular diseases. methods: twenty-two pericardial aspirates were collected aseptically prior to forensic autopsy at tampere university hospital during 2009-2010. of the autopsies, 10 (45.5%) were free of coronary artery disease (cad), 7 (31.8%) had mild and 5 (22.7%) had severe cad. bacterial dna amounts were determined using real-time quantitative pcr with specific primers and probes for all bacterial strains associated with endodontic disease (streptococcus mitis group, streptococcus anginosus group, staphylococcus aureus/staphylococcus epidermidis,  prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra) and periodontal disease (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatus, and dialister pneumosintes). results: of 22 cases, 14 (63.6%) were positive for endodontic and 8 (36.4%) for periodontal-disease-associated bacteria. only one case was positive for bacterial culturing. there was a statistically significant association between the relative amount of bacterial dna in the pericardial fluid and the severity of cad (p=0.035). conclusions: oral bacterial dna was detectable in pericardial fluid and an association between the severity of cad and the total amount of bacterial  dna in pericardial fluid was found, suggesting that this kind of measurement might be useful for clinical purposes.

TI  == periodontal and peri-implant microbiota in patients with healthy and inflamed periodontal and peri-implant tissues.
AB  == objective: to compare the prevalence and levels of six bacterial pathogens within the subgingival/submucosal microbiota at teeth versus implants with various clinical conditions. material and methods: twenty-two chinese were included. four subgingival/submucosal sites were selected for microbiological sampling within each subject, that is, (1) healthy peri-implant tissues; (2) peri-implantitis [ppd >/= 5 mm, presence of bleeding on probing (bop) and confirmed radiographic bone loss]; (3) healthy gingiva; and (4) periodontitis (ppd >/=4 mm). subgingival/submucosal plaque was sampled using paper points. quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-pcr) was used to quantify six pathogens, including porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.), treponema denticola (t.d.), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), fusobacterium nucleatum (f.n.), prevotella intermedia (p.i.), and staphylococcus aureus (s.a.). counts were log10-transformed. results: the most commonly detected species were s. a. and f.  n., while a. a. and. p. i. had the lowest detection frequency. the detection frequencies of diseased tooth or implant sites for each of the six target species were either equal to or higher than the respective frequencies at the corresponding healthy sites. there were no statistically significant differences  for any of the species or clinical sites (p > 0.05, cochran's q test). no statistically significant differences in the bacterial loads were found among the four clinical sites; with the exception of f. nucleatum. this was more abundant in periodontitis sites (p = 0.023, friedman's 2-way anova). both periodontal and  peri-implant sites, irrespective of their health status, were revealed to harbor  s. aureus cells. the log10-transformed loads of s. aureus were approximately 3.5  within each of the clinical sites (p = 0.232). this was the highest of the six species analyzed. conclusions: within the same subjects, putative periodontal pathogens were common to both periodontal and peri-implant sites irrespective of  health status. the prevalence and levels of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum were significantly associated with periodontitis, but not with peri-implantitis. a. actinomycetemcomitans was associated with both disease conditions, periodontitis  and peri-implantitis, but not with either gingival or mucosal health.

TI  == susceptibility of methacrylate-based root canal filling to degradation by bacteria found in endodontic infections.
AB  == objectives: to present a case of endodontic failure obturated with a methacrylate-based root filling material, resilon/realseal (rs). to determine if  rs is susceptible to biodegradation by endodontically relevant microbes by a method known to show rs degradation. method and materials: emulsions of rs were dispersed in agar with minimal bacterial nutrients in culture plates. lipase ps served as a positive control. pseudomonas aeruginosa, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis were tested for their ability to biodegrade rs. the bacteria were inoculated in the plates and examined daily for rs degradation for 7 days. results: degradation of the emulsified rs manifested in the formation of clear zones around p aeruginosa, p intermedia, p asaccharolytica, s aureus, and s epidermidis. no degradation was seen with the other tested bacteria or in plates that did not contain rs emulsion. conclusion:  endodontic pathogenic bacteria can degrade rs. these findings complement other work and suggest that the seal and integrity of root canal fillings obturated with rs may be impaired by a microbial insult.

TI  == assessment of periodontal and opportunistic flora in patients with peri-implantitis.
AB  == aim: to assess the presence of periodontal and opportunistic organisms in patients with peri-implantitis. material and methods: thirty-three partially edentulous subjects (22 women, 11 men), aged 32-90 years, who had one or more implants with peri-implantitis were included. peri-implantitis was defined as: (i) the presence of bleeding on probing and/or suppuration and (ii) radiographic  images showed marginal bone loss >1.8 mm after 1 year in function. criteria for inclusion were: (i) partially edentulous patients having at least one implant diagnosed with peri-implantitis; (ii) no antibiotic therapy for 6 months prior to clinical examination. following this definition, a total of 48 implants were diagnosed with peri-implantitis. subgingival bacterial samples were obtained with sterile paper points from infected implants and selected teeth of each individual. periodontopathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) were detected by multiplex pcr targeting 16s rdna. samples were placed in reduced transport medium and cultured for opportunistic pathogens  (staphylococcus aureus, enteric bacteria, pseudomonas and yeasts). results: twenty-two patients yielded positive results for p. gingivalis, 25 for t. forsythia, eight for p. intermedia and 13 for t. denticola. none of the patients  yielded a positive result for a. actinomycetemcomitans. non-periodontal species were found in five patients (15% of total). p. aeruginosa was found in four (12%) patients, and c. albicans (3%) and s. aureus in one patient (3%) each. in two cases of peri-implantitis, none of the periodontal or opportunistic microorganisms studied were detected in either implant or tooth samples. when results of the periodontopathic bacteria from the implant and tooth samples of the same patient were compared, 18 patients (54%) showed the same results for both samples and 15 (45%) patients different results. conclusions: the implant surface may be colonized with pathogens different from periodontal bacteria. opportunistic pathogens such as p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and c. albicans may be associated with implant failure.

TI  == adhesion and biofilm formation by periodontopathogenic bacteria on different commercial brackets.
AB  == aim: to compare early bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation of common and uncommon periodontal pathogens on a variety of commercial brackets in vitro. materials and methods: in vitro adhesion and biofilm formation of 4 bacterial strains on 15 different commercial brackets, in standard culture mediums with and without addition of either serum or human saliva was evaluated by quantitative real time pcr after extraction of bacterial dna. results: materials significantly influenced bacterial adhesiveness in a species-specific way. titanium and gold brackets constantly yielded the lowest values with all tested bacteria and in all tested conditions. bracket materials and medium of growth significantly influenced biofilm formation. conclusion: materials and environmental conditions  significantly influence biofilm formation by periodontal pathogens at the surface of brackets. whenever possible brackets should be kept far from the gingival margin and if this is not possible, brackets made of gold, titanium, and ceramic  should be preferentially used.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal effects of 625, 525, and 425 nm wavelength (red, green, and blue) light-emitting diode irradiation.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship of 625, 525, and 425 nm wavelengths, providing average power output and effects on three  common pathogenic bacteria. background data: ultraviolet (uv) light kills bacteria, but the bactericidal effects of uv may not be unique, as 425 nm produces a similar effect. the bactericidal effects of light-emitting diode (led) wavelengths such as 625 and 525 nm have not been described. before conducting clinical trials, the appropriate wavelength with reasonable dose and exposure time should be established. materials and methods: the bactericidal effects of 625, 525, and 425 nm wavelength led irradiation were investigated in vitro for the anaerobic bacterium porphyromonas gingivalis and two aerobes (staphylococcus  aureus and escherichia coli dh5alpha). average power output was 6 mw/cm(2) for 1  h. the bacteria were exposed to led irradiation for 1, 2, 4, and 8 h (21.6, 43.2, 86.4, and 172.8 j/cm(2), respectively). led irradiation was performed during growth on agar and in broth. control bacteria were incubated without led irradiation. bacterial growth was expressed in colony-forming units (cfu) and at  an optical density at 600 nm in agar and broth. results: the bactericidal effect  of led phototherapy depended upon wavelength, power density, bacterial viable number, and bacteria species. the bactericidal effect of 425 and 525 nm irradiation varied depending upon the bacterial inoculation, compared with unirradiated samples and samples irradiated with red light. especially, p. gingivalis and e. coli dh5alpha were killed by 425 nm, and s. aureus growth was inhibited by 525 nm. however, the wavelength of 625 nm was not bactericidal for p. gingivalis, e. coli dh5alpha, or s. aureus. conclusions: irradiation at 625 nm light was not bactericidal to s. aureus, e. coli, and p. gingivalis, whereas wavelengths of 425 and 525 nm had bactericidal effects. s. aureus was also killed at 525 nm.

TI  == comparison of the antibacterial activity of an ozonated oil with chlorhexidine digluconate and povidone-iodine. a disk diffusion test.
AB  == ozonated oils are antiseptics obtained from the chemical reaction between ozone and unsaturated fatty acids of vegetable oils. the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial effectiveness of a commercially available ozonated  oil (o3-oil), in comparison with 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate (chx) and 10% povidone-iodine (pvp-i) through a disk diffusion test. for each antiseptic a series of two-fold dilutions was made, obtaining seven dilutions: 1:2, 1:4, 1:8,  1:16, 1:32, 1:64 and 1:128. the undiluted antiseptics and the seven dilutions were tested against two freeze-dried bacterial strains: staphylococcus aureus (sa) and porphyromonas gingivalis (pg). o3-oil showed significantly greater diameters of growth inhibition (p<0.01) than chx and pvp-i in all dilutions for both tested strains. chx lost any antibacterial efficacy when diluted more than 1:32. at the highest dilution, the diameters of growth inhibition against sa were 20.67+/-0.58 mm and 15.33+/-0.58 mm, for o3-oil and pvp-i, respectively. at the same dilution, the diameters of growth inhibition against pg were: 19.00 mm for o3-oil and 13.67+/-0.58 mm for pvp-i. the promising results obtained for the o3-oil, against the opportunistic sa, and pg, one of the main periodontal pathogens, suggest its potential applicability for periodontal treatment. further preclinical and clinical investigations are warranted.

TI  == evaluation of a d-amino-acid-containing fluorescence resonance energy transfer peptide library for profiling prokaryotic proteases.
AB  == bacterial proteases play an important role in a broad spectrum of processes, including colonization, proliferation, and virulence. in this respect, bacterial  proteases are potential biomarkers for bacterial diagnosis and targets for novel  therapeutic protease inhibitors. to investigate these potential functions, the authors designed and used a protease substrate fluorescence resonance energy transfer (fret) library comprising 115 short d- and l-amino-acid-containing fluorogenic substrates as a tool to generate proteolytic profiles for a wide range of bacteria. bacterial specificity of the d-amino acid substrates was confirmed using enzymes isolated from both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms.  interestingly, bacterial proteases that are known to be involved in housekeeping  and nutrition, but not in virulence, were able to degrade substrates in which a d-amino acid was present. using our fret peptide library and culture supernatants from a total of 60 different bacterial species revealed novel, bacteria-specific, proteolytic profiles, although in-species variation was observed for pseudomonas  aeruginosa, porphyromonas gingivalis, and staphylococcus aureus. overall, the specific characteristic of our substrate peptide library makes it a rapid tool to high-throughput screen for novel substrates to detect bacterial proteolytic activity.

TI  == phenylalanine 664 of dipeptidyl peptidase (dpp) 7 and phenylalanine 671 of dpp11  mediate preference for p2-position hydrophobic residues of a substrate.
AB  == dipeptidyl peptidases (dpps) are crucial for the energy metabolism in porphyromonas gingivalis, a gram-negative proteolytic and asaccharolytic anaerobic rod causing chronic periodontitis. three dpps, dppiv specific for pro,  dpp7 for hydrophobic residues and dpp11 for asp/glu at the p1 position, are expressed in the bacterium. like dpp7, dpp11 belongs to the s46 protease family,  and they share 38.7% sequence identity. although dpp11 is preferential for hydrophobic residues at the p2 position, it has been reported that dpp7 has no preference at the p2 position. in the present study, we defined the detailed p2 substrate preference of dpp7 and the amino acid residue responsible for the specificity. dpp7 most efficiently hydrolyzed met-leu-dipeptidyl-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (mca) carrying hydrophobic residues at the p1 position with k cat/km of 10.62 +/- 2.51 mum(-1) s(-1), while it unexpectedly cleaved substrates with hydrophilic (gln, asn) or charged (asp, arg) residues. examination with 21 dipeptidyl mca demonstrated that dpp7-peptidase activity was dependent on hydrophobicity of the p2- as well as p1-position residue, thus it correlated best with the sum of the hydrophobicity index of p1-  and p2-amino acid residues. hydrophobicity of the p1 and p2 positions ensured efficient enzyme catalysis by increasing k cat and lowering km values, respectively. substitution of hydrophobic residues conserved in the s46 dpp7/dpp11 family to ala revealed that phe664 of dpp7 and phe671 of dpp11 primarily afforded hydrophobic p2 preference. a modeling study suggested that phe664 and gly666 of dpp7 and phe671 and arg673 of dpp11 being associated with the p2- and p1-position residues, respectively, are located adjacent to the catalytic ser648/ser655. the present results expand the substrate repertoire of dpp7, which ensures efficient degradation of oligopeptides in asaccharolytic bacteria.

TI  == molecular mapping to species level of the tonsillar crypt microbiota associated with health and recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  == the human palatine tonsils, which belong to the central antigen handling sites of the mucosal immune system, are frequently affected by acute and recurrent infections. this study compared the microbiota of the tonsillar crypts in children and adults affected by recurrent tonsillitis with that of healthy adults and children with tonsillar hyperplasia. an in-depth 16s rrna gene based pyrosequencing approach combined with a novel strategy that included phylogenetic analysis and detection of species-specific sequence signatures enabled identification of the major part of the microbiota to species level. a complex microbiota consisting of between 42 and 110 taxa was demonstrated in both children and adults. this included a core microbiome of 12 abundant genera found  in all samples regardless of age and health status. yet, haemophilus influenzae,  neisseria species, and streptococcus pneumoniae were almost exclusively detected  in children. in contrast, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae was present in all samples. obligate anaerobes like porphyromonas, prevotella, and fusobacterium were abundantly present in children, but the species diversity of porphyromonas and prevotella was larger in adults and included species that are considered putative pathogens in periodontal diseases, i.e. porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, and tannerella forsythia. unifrac analysis showed that recurrent tonsillitis is associated with a shift in the microbiota of the tonsillar crypts. fusobacterium necrophorum, streptococcus intermedius and prevotella melaninogenica/histicola were associated with recurrent tonsillitis in adults, whereas species traditionally associated with acute tonsillitis like pyogenic streptococci and staphylococcus aureus were scarce. the findings suggest that recurrent tonsillitis is a polymicrobial infection in which interactions within consortia of taxa play an etiologic role. the study contributes to the human microbiome data, to the understanding of the etiology of infections affecting the tonsils, and forms a basis for further insight into the consequences of the intense microbe-host interactions that take place in the tonsils.

TI  == the short-term treatment effects on the microbiota at the dorsum of the tongue in intra-oral halitosis patients--a randomized clinical trial.
AB  == objectives: this study aims to assess the effects of rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse with or without adjunct tongue scraping on volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) in breath air, and the microbiota at the dorsum  of the tongue. material and methods: a randomized single-masked controlled clinical trial with a cross-over study design over 14 days including 21 subjects  was performed. bacterial samples from the dorsum of the tongue were assayed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: no halitosis (identified by vsc assessments) at day 14 was identified in 12/21 subjects with active rinse alone,  in 10/21 with adjunct use of tongue scraper, in 1/21 for negative control rinse alone, and in 3/21 in the control and tongue scraping sequence. at day 14, significantly lower counts were identified only in the active rinse sequence (p < 0.001) for 15/78 species including, fusobacterium sp., porphyromonas gingivalis,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and tannerella forsythia. a decrease in bacteria from baseline to day 14 was found in successfully treated subjects for 9/74 species including: p. gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica, s. aureus, and treponema denticola. baseline vsc scores were correlated with several bacterial species. the use of a tongue scraper combined with active rinse did not change the levels of vsc compared to rinsing alone. conclusions: vsc scores were  not associated with bacterial counts in samples taken from the dorsum of the tongue. the active rinse alone containing zinc and chlorhexidine had effects on intra-oral halitosis and reduced bacterial counts of species associated with malodor. tongue scraping provided no beneficial effects on the microbiota studied. clinical relevance: periodontally healthy subjects with intra-oral halitosis benefit from daily rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse.

AB  == protein tyrosine phosphatases (ptps) are increasingly recognized as important effectors of host-pathogen interactions. since guan and dixon reported in 1990 that phosphatase yoph serves as an essential virulence determinant of yersinia, the field shifted significantly forward, and dozens of ptps were identified in various microorganisms and even in viruses. the discovery of extensive tyrosine signaling networks in non-metazoan organisms refuted the moth-eaten paradigm claiming that these organisms rely exclusively on phosphoserine/phosphothreonine  signaling. similarly to humans, phosphotyrosine signaling is thought to comprise  a small fraction of total protein phosphorylation, but plays a disproportionately important role in cell-cycle control, differentiation, and invasiveness. here we  summarize the state-of-art knowledge on ptps of important non-metazoan pathogens  (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, porphyromonas gingivalis, caulobacter crescentus, yersinia, synechocystis, leishmania, plasmodium falciparum, entamoeba histolytica, etc.), and focus also at the microbial proteins affecting directly or indirectly the ptps of the host (mycobacterium tuberculosis mtsa-10, bacillus anthracis anthrax toxin, streptococcal beta protein, helicobacter pylori caga and vaca, leishmania gp63 and ef-1alpha, plasmodium hemozoin, etc.). this is the first review summarizing the knowledge on biological activity and pharmacological inhibition of non-metazoan ptps, with the emphasis of those important in host-pathogen interactions. targeting of numerous  non-metazoan ptps is simplified by the fact that they act either as ectophosphatases or are secreted outside of the pathogen. interfering with tyrosine phosphorylation represents a powerful pharmacologic approach, and even though the ptp inhibitors are difficult to develop, lifting the fog of phosphatase inhibition is of the great market potential and further clinical impact.

TI  == bactericidal properties of pradofloxacin against veterinary pathogens.
AB  == pradofloxacin is a new veterinary 8-cyano-fluoroquinolone developed for use against bacterial infections in dogs and cats involving both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the minimal bactericidal concentrations have been determined  against clinical isolates of staphylococcus pseudintermedius, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, streptococcus canis, proteus spp., fusobacterium spp., porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella species. a subset of these species was selected, and the in vitro rate of kill by pradofloxacin was determined. for 27 of the 30 tested aerobic strains the pradofloxacin mbc was within two doubling dilutions of the mic. for the remaining strains, the mic and mbc were within three to four doubling dilutions. pradofloxacin also demonstrated bactericidal activity against all anaerobic strains, and the mbc was equal to the mic for four of the strains, within 1 doubling dilution for three strains, within 2 dilutions for a further 3 strains and within 3 dilutions for the remaining five strains. as pradofloxacin concentration was increased, a faster rate of killing was observed; bactericidal  effects were seen in all cases at concentrations </= 0.25 mug/ml. the bactericidal activity against the anaerobic strains was marked, of particular relevance was the complete absence of regrowth even at 48 h at concentrations as  low as 0.125 mug/ml. in conclusion, pradofloxacin exhibits clear bactericidal activity in terms of mbc and kill kinetics against aerobic and anaerobic clinical isolates from dogs and cats at concentrations that are greatly exceeded within the systemic circulation after administration of the recommended therapeutic doses to the target animals. it is expected that such a rapid rate of kill will play a significant role in clinical efficacy. these data demonstrate the complete and rapid killing of anaerobic bacteria by a veterinary 8-cyano-fluoroquinolone.

TI  == dna/protamine complex paste for an injectable dental material.
AB  == a dna/protamine complex powder was prepared by reaction between dna and protamine sulfate solution with stirring in order to develop a new injectable biomaterials  for dental therapy. the powder of dna/protamine complex became paste by kneading  the complex powder and distilled water. complex formation was confirmed by ft-ir  measurement. the complex paste had a porous structure and its viscosity was approximately 280.1 pas. the paste could easily pass through a needle of 0.25 mm  internal diameter. it seemed that dna/protamine complex paste has suitable viscosity for clinical use as an injectable biomaterial. although, the complex paste delayed the growth speed of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia for limited periods, it cannot kill and inhibit growing bacteria. the complex paste disk showed a mild tissue response and gradually degraded after the implantation into the soft tissue of rats. these results suggested that this dna/protamine complex paste could be a useful material for a biodegradable biomaterial. in particular, this paste will be applicable as an injectable biomaterial using syringe for the repair of defects of living tissue, gbr treatment and/or gtr treatment in dentistry.

TI  == electrochemically induced anatase inhibits bacterial colonization on titanium grade 2 and ti6al4v alloy for dental and orthopedic devices.
AB  == bacterial contamination of implanted devices is a common cause of their failure.  the aim of the present study was to assess the capability of electrochemical procedures to: (a) promote the formation of anatase on the surface of commercially pure grade 2 ti and ti grade 5 (ti6al4v) alloy; (b) inhibit in vitro biofilm formation of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis and oral plaque in vivo, (c) preserve favorable response of osteoblasts and fibroblasts to materials surfaces. ti grade 2 and ti grade 5 were respectively anodized at two different voltages: 90 and 130v for pure titanium; 100 and 120v for ti6al4v alloy. surface characterization was performed by scanning electron microscopy (sem) equipped with eds probe, laser profilometry and x-ray diffractometry. bacterial adhesion characterization was performed either in vitro and in vivo in patients. osteoblast and fibroblast response was evaluated by metabolic activity assessment. the higher voltage applied in the anodization treatment of pure titanium (130v) and ti6al4v alloy (120v) surfaces, compared to the untreated pure titanium and ti6al4v and to lower voltage treatments, resulted in a greater decrease in bacterial attachment and biofilm formation in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. in contrast, the high voltage treatments were found to promote  osteoblasts and fibroblasts proliferation. the observations indicated that the experimented high voltage anodization treatments may contribute to preserve the tissue integration and reduce bacteria colonization of titanium and titanium alloy for implantable applications.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis enzymes enhance infection with human metapneumovirus in  vitro.
AB  == relatively recently discovered, human metapneumovirus (hmpv) is a human pathogen  with worldwide prevalence, accounting for a substantial percentage of respiratory tract diseases. concurrent viral and bacterial infections enable intricate mechanisms of cooperation between pathogens, which complicate the symptoms and outcome of the disease. such bilateral interactions are based on the modulation of bacterial growth on epithelium pathologically altered during viral illness and the modulation of immune responses, as well as the enhancement of virus replication by bacterial virulence factors. this study showed that proteases produced by porphyromonas gingivalis, a gram-negative bacterium implicated in the development of periodontitis, named gingipains, facilitated hmpv replication in llc-mk2 cells and may contribute to hmpv pathogenicity in patients with periodontitis. gingipains at low nanomolar concentrations enabled hmpv replication and allowed virus propagation in vitro. in contrast to previously published data for influenza virus, however, staphylococcus aureus proteases and  human neutrophil elastase did not affect virus replication.

TI  == classification
AB  == bacteria are classified and identified to distinguish one organism from another and to group similar organisms by criteria of interest to microbiologists or other scientists. the most important level of this type of classification is the  species level. a species name should mean the same thing to everyone. within one  species, strains and subgroups can differ by the disease they produce, their environmental habitat, and many other characteristics. formerly, species were created on the basis of such criteria, which may be extremely important for clinical microbiologists and physicians but which are not a sufficient basis for  establishing a species. verification of existing species and creation of new species should involve biochemical and other phenotypic criteria as well as dna relatedness. in numerical or phenetic approaches to classification, strains are grouped on the basis of a large number of phenotypic characteristics. dna relatedness is used to group strains on the basis of overall genetic similarity.  species are identified in the clinical laboratory by morphological traits and biochemical tests, some of which are supplemented by serologic assessments (e.g., identification of salmonella and shigella species). because of differences in pathogenicity (escherichia coli) or the necessity to characterize a disease outbreak (vibrio cholerae, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), strains  of medical interest are often classified below the species level by serology or identification of toxins. pathogenic or epidemic strains also can be classified by the presence of a specific plasmid, by their plasmid profile (the number and sizes of plasmids), or by bacteriophage susceptibility patterns (phage typing). newer molecular biologic techniques have enabled scientists to identify some species and strains (without the use of biochemical tests) by identifying a specific gene or genetic sequence, sometimes directly from the clinical specimen. laboratories have no difficulty in identifying typical strains of common bacteria using commonly available test systems. problems do arise, however, when atypical  strains or rare or newly described species are not in the data base. such difficulties are compounded when the strains are misidentified rather than unidentified, and so laboratory personnel and physicians (at least infectious diseases specialists) should be familiar with taxonomic reference texts and journals that publish papers on new species. bacterial nomenclature at the genus  and species level changes often, based primarily on the use of newer genetic techniques. a species may acquire more than one name. in some cases the recognition of a new species results in a unique correlation with specific clinical problems. for example, recognition of porphyromonas gingivalis as a unique species, separate from its previous inclusion within bacteroides melaninogenicus (now known to be composed of several taxonomic groups of black-pigmenting anaerobic gram-negative bacilli), elucidated its role as a key pathogen in adult periodontitis. it is important to understand why these changes  and synonyms exist in taxonomy. the clinical laboratory is concerned with the rapid, sensitive, and accurate identification of microbes involved in producing disease. the number and types of tests done in such a laboratory depend on its size and the population it serves. highly specialized or rarely performed tests should be done only by reference laboratories. physicians, clinical laboratory personnel, and reference laboratory personnel must have a good working relationship if patients are to receive first-rate care. in addition, the physician and the clinical laboratory personnel must know which diseases and isolates are reportable to public health laboratories and how to report them .

TI  == gingipains produced by porphyromonas gingivalis atcc49417 degrade human-beta-defensin 3 and affect peptide's antibacterial activity in vitro.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, one of the major pathogen associated with periodontitis, is a highly proteolytic bacterial species. production of proteases is a common microbial virulence factor that enables the destruction of host tissues and evasion from host defense mechanisms. antimicrobial peptides are important effector molecules of the innate immune system with a broad range of antimicrobial and immunoregulatory activities. we and others have previously demonstrated that p. gingivalis is relatively resistant to the bactericidal activity of the human beta-defensin 3 (hbd3). in this study, ability of proteases released by the pathogenic strain of p. gingivalis atcc 49417 to degrade hbd3 and to affect the antibacterial properties of the peptide was assessed. p. gingivalis culture supernatants (cs) were found to degrade hbd3 in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. such degradation was mainly due to the activity of arg and lys-gingipains, as pretreatment of cs with inhibitors selective for this class of proteases abolished cs ability to degrade hbd3. importantly, preincubation of hbd3 with cs reduced peptide's antibacterial activity against a susceptible strain of staphylococcus aureus, while the presence of gingipain inhibitors in the bactericidal assay increased p. gingivalis susceptibility to hbd3. altogether these results suggest that gingipains may have a role in the resistance of p. gingivalis atcc 49417 to hbd3.

AB  == background and objective: abnormal neutrophil responses have been observed in periodontitis patients, including hyper-reactivity in terms of production of reactive oxygen species (ros) following exposure to the key quorum-sensing plaque bacterium, fusobacterium nucleatum. this study was designed to characterize the transcriptional response of neutrophils to f. nucleatum. material and methods: peripheral blood neutrophils were exposed to f. nucleatum, and gene expression was analysed using high-throughput transcriptomics. results: microarray technology demonstrated differential expression of 208 genes (163 increased and 43 decreased relative to control genes), which identified regulation of several ontological classes, including signal transduction (13%), transcription regulation (7%) and ros response (14%). individual gene expression analysis of selected transcripts, including csf, cxcl3, fos, hmox1, hsp40, sod2, nfkb2 and gp91, in individual and pooled rna samples from control and f. nucleatum-exposed  neutrophils corroborated microarray data. analysis of ros generation, combined with transcript analysis, in response to a panel of proinflammatory stimuli (f. nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide and opsonized staphylococcus aureus) identified significant differences in ros and transcript regulatory control. further analyses of neutrophils from periodontitis patients and periodontally healthy control subjects stimulated with f. nucleatum  indicated significant differential induction of several ros response-related transcripts. conclusion: these data demonstrate that neutrophils are transcriptionally active in response to the periodontal pathogen f. nucleatum and that these changes in gene expression are likely to affect neutrophil function. the differential response of neutrophils to a range of stimuli combined with data demonstrating differences between patient and control neutrophils indicate the importance of this cell and its interaction with the local tissue environment in  the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

TI  == how microorganisms avoid phagocyte attraction.
AB  == microorganisms have developed several mechanisms to modulate the host immune system to increase their survival and propagation in the host. their presence in  the host is not only revealed by self-produced peptides but also through host-derived chemokines and active complement fragments. these so-called chemoattractants are recognized by g protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs) expressed  on leukocyte cell membranes. activation of gpcrs triggers leukocyte activation and guides their recruitment to the site of infection. therefore, gpcrs play a central role in leukocyte trafficking leading to microbial clearance. it is therefore not surprising that microorganisms are able to sabotage this arm of the immune response. different microorganisms have evolved a variety of tactics to modulate gpcr activation. here, we review the mechanisms and proteins used by major human pathogens and less virulent microorganisms that affect gpcr signaling. while viruses generally produce receptor and chemoattractant mimics, parasites and bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, porphyromonas gingivalis, and bordetella pertussis secrete proteins that affect receptor signaling, directly antagonize receptors, cleave stimuli, and even prevent stimulus generation. as the large arsenal of gpcr modulators aids prolonged microbial persistence in the host, their study provides us a better understanding of microbial pathogenesis.

TI  == elafin is specifically inactivated by rgpb from porphyromonas gingivalis by distinct proteolytic cleavage.
AB  == abstract porphyromonas gingivalis, the major causative bacterium of periodontitis, contributes significantly to elevated proteolytic activity at periodontal pockets owing to the presence of both bacteria and host, predominantly neutrophil-derived, serine proteases. normally the activity of the  latter enzymes is tightly regulated by endogenous proteins, including elafin, a potent neutrophil elastase and proteinase 3 inhibitor released from epithelial cells at sites of inflammation. here, we report that all three gingipains (hrgpa, rgpb, and kgp) have the ability to degrade elafin, with rgpb being far more efficient than other gingipains. rgpb efficiently inactivates the inhibitory activity of elafin at subnanomolar concentrations through proteolysis limited to  the arg22-cys23 peptide bond within the surface loop harboring the inhibitor active site. notably, elafin resists inactivation by several staphylococcus aureus-derived serine and cysteine proteases, confirming the high stability of this protein against proteolytic degradation. therefore, we conclude that elafin  inactivation by rgpb represents a specific pathogenic adaptation of p. gingivalis to disturb the protease-protease inhibitor balance in the infected gingival tissue. this contributes to enhanced degradation of host proteins and generation  of a pool of peptides serving as nutrients for this asaccharolytic pathogen.

AB  == dental implants have become increasingly common for the management of tooth loss. despite their placement in a contaminated surgical field, success rates are relatively high. this article reviews dental implants and highlights factors leading to infection and potential implant failure. a literature search identified studies analysing the microbial composition of peri-implant infections. the microflora of dental peri-implantitis resembles that found in chronic periodontitis, featuring predominantly anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, in particular porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia, anaerobic gram-negative cocci such as veillonella spp. and spirochaetes including treponema denticola. the role of staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci that are typically encountered in orthopaedic infections is debatable, although they undoubtedly play a role when isolated from clinically infected sites. likewise, the aetiological involvement of coliforms and candida spp. requires further longitudinal studies. currently, there are neither standardised antibiotic prophylactic regimens for dental implant placement nor universally accepted treatment for peri-implantitis. the treatment of infected implants is difficult and usually requires removal. in the uk there is no systematic post-surgical implant surveillance programme. therefore, the development of such  a project would be advisable and provide valuable epidemiological data.

TI  == augmentation of the antimicrobial activities of guinea pig cathelicidin cap11-derived peptides by amino acid substitutions.
AB  == mammalian myeloid and epithelial cells express various peptide antibiotics (such  as defensin and cathelicidin) that contribute to the innate host defense against  invading microorganisms. among these, guinea pig cathelicidin cap11 (g1-i43) possesses potent antibacterial activities against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, and also lipopolysaccharide-neutralizing activity. we previously revealed that the active region with antibacterial activity is localized at g1 to r18 of cap11. in this study, to develop peptide derivatives with enhanced antimicrobial actions, we utilized the amphipathic 18-mer peptide (g1-r18) as a template. anti-microbial activities of the peptides were assessed by alamarblue assay (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans) and colony formation assay (porphyromonas gingivalis). furthermore, the membrane-permeabilization activities were determined by using e. coli ml-35p as a target. by substituting k5, t9, r10, r12, and g17 with five l residues, the hydrophobicity of the peptide (1-18m1) was increased, and by substituting g1, and q14 with k and r residues, respectively, the hydrophilicity (positive charge) of  the peptide (1-18m2) was enhanced. among the peptides, 1-18m2 exhibits the most potent antimicrobial and membrane-permeabilizing activities against the microorganisms examined. thus, the antimicrobial activities of the amphipathic cap11-derived 18-mer peptide can be augmented by modifying its hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity (positive charge), and 1-18m2 is the most potent among the peptide derivatives with therapeutic potential for gram-positive and -negative bacterial, and fungal infections.

TI  == relationship of neutrophil phagocytosis and oxidative burst with the subgingival  microbiota of generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == introduction: polymorphonuclear neutrophil (pmn) dysfunctions have been associated with severe forms of periodontitis. this study evaluated the correlation between pmn phagocytosis and oxidative burst with the subgingival microbiota of patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp). methods: heparinized peripheral blood samples were obtained from 18 gagp patients and 11 periodontally healthy (ph) subjects, and pmns were isolated on a ficoll-hypaque gradient. for phagocytosis analysis, pmns were incubated with fluorescein-labeled staphylococcus aureus. the oxidative burst was evaluated by incubation of pmns with dihydroethidium and activation by s. aureus. the assays were examined using  flow cytometry. subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from periodontal sites  with and without periodontitis and 24 species were detected by checkerboard. results: a significantly lower phagocytosis rate was observed for patients with gagp compared with ph subjects over time (p < 0.05). no differences between groups were found for superoxide production. gagp patients presented significantly higher prevalence and levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans serotype b than controls (p < 0.05). significant negative correlations between t. forsythia and p. gingivalis and pmn functions were observed. conclusions: gagp subjects presented diminished phagocytic activity of peripheral pmns and high prevalence and levels of classical periodontal pathogens.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == endodontic microorganism susceptibility by direct contact test.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro the duration of the antimicrobial  effect of endodontic sealers by means of the direct contact test. the sealers tested were: endomethasone - septodont, endomethasone c-septodont, endion-voco, diaket-espe, pulp canal sealer-sybronendo, and ah26-dentsply detrey. the endodontopathic microorganisms (mo) confronted were: staphylococcus aureus (sa),  candida albicans (ca), enterococcus faecalis (ef), prevotella intermedia (pi), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) and fusobacterium nucleatum (fn). test specimens of each sealer were prepared and placed on the surface of agar plates that had been  inoculated with each mo, and after predetermined periods, transfers were made from the contact area between the test specimen and the cultured agar and from the area that had not been in contact with the test specimens (control). the results were read as presence/absence of microbial growth and analyzed statistically using the kruskal-wallis test. it was concluded that the structural features and virulence of endodontopathic microorganisms determine their response to the sealers, independently of the time during which sealers act and the mechanism by which the antiseptic reaches the microorganism, which in this case was by direct contact.

TI  == influence of the menstrual cycle on the oral microbial flora in women: a case-control study including men as control subjects.
AB  == changes in the levels of female sex hormones during the menstrual cycle may cause cyclic differences in subgingival bacterial colonization patterns. the purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that hormonal changes in the menstrual cycle cause changes in the oral microbiota. methods: bacterial plaque samples were collected in 20 systemically and periodontally healthy women using no hormonal contraceptives (test group) over a period of 6 weeks. twenty age-matched systemically and periodontally healthy men were assigned to the control group. samples were processed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assay, and 74 species were analyzed. results: no cyclic pattern of bacterial colonization was identified for any of the 74 species studied in women not using  hormonal contraceptives. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) (y4) was common at the beginning of menstruation (mean: 32%) and increased during the following 2 weeks (36%) in women (p <0.05). no cyclic differences in bacterial presence were found among the men (p values varied between 0.14 and 0.98). men presented with significantly higher bacterial counts for 40 of 74 species (p <0.001), including staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa but not porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.15) or  tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (p = 0.42). conclusions: during a menstruation period, cyclic variation in the subgingival microbiota of periodontally healthy women of child-bearing age who were not using oral hormonal contraceptives could not be confirmed. male control subjects presented with higher levels of many species but also without a cyclic pattern.

TI  == bacteriological and clinical evaluation of twelve cases of post-surgical sepsis of odontogenic tumours at a referral centre.
AB  == objective: to determine the bacterial aetiology of sepsis occurring following surgery of odontogenic tumours and assess the effect of prompt and proper antibiotic usage. design: a prospective study. setting: a tertiary referral centre in lagos, nigeria. subjects: twelve patients with odontogenic tumours that developed sepsis postoperatively. eight of the patients were referred from private hospitals, the remaining were in-patients who sought for alternative medical attention following interruption of health care services at the referral  centre. intervention: adequate review of patient's medical history, bacteriological investigations and antibiotic therapy. main outcome measures: bacteriological and clinical cure following antibiotic therapy based on susceptibility test results. results: two categories of patients were identified; those who completed the course of antibiotics prescribed post-surgery and patients who failed to conform to antibiotic prescription. sepsis developed in the non-compliance group much earlier than in the group that complied (p<0.001).  infections were polybacterial with aerobes accounting for 77.4% (alpha-haemolytic streptococci 29.0%, streptococcus pyogenes 16.1%, staphylococcus aureus 16.1%, diphtheroids 9.7%, klebsiella pneumoniae 6.5%) and anaerobes 22.6% (porphyromonas gingivalis 9.7%, peptostreptococcus spp. 6.5%, prevotella melaninogenica 3.2%, clostridium perfringens 3.2%). mixed aerobic and anaerobic aetiology occurred more in osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma. clostridium perfringens was isolated from  a case of osteosarcoma with necrotic tissues. the anaerobic bacteria were 100% sensitive to metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and augmentin, 65-85% sensitivity to ampicloxacillin, amoxicillin and erythromycin. over 92% of the streptococci were  sensitive to the beta-lactams contrast low susceptibility with s. aureus and k. pneumoniae. conclusion: interruption of healthcare service was the sole factor identified in the development of sepsis as the patients could not be monitored to ensure compliance to prescription.

TI  == effects of low-energy shock waves on oral bacteria.
AB  == we have recently demonstrated that extracorporeal shock-wave therapy (eswt) is effective in promoting the healing of dermal wounds and in regenerating alveolar  bone lost through periodontal disease. the objective of the present study was to  determine any antibacterial effect of eswt on oral bacteria. monoculture suspensions of 6 bacterial species were treated with 100 to 500 pulses of eswt at energy flux densities (efd) of 0.12 mj/mm(2), 0.22 mj/mm(2), and 0.3 mj/mm(2). following treatment, aliquots were plated for viability determination and compared with untreated controls. eswt showed a significant microbicidal effect for streptococcus mutans and an unencapsulated strain of porphyromonas gingivalis following as few as 100 pulses at 0.3 mj/mm(2) (p <or= 0.001). in addition, a significant disruption of bacterial aggregates was observed at lower efds. no significant reduction in viability was observed for all other bacteria at efds and pulses tested (p > 0.05). these findings suggest that low-energy eswt may be  bactericidal for selected oral bacteria.

TI  == periodontal status of patients with dentin dysplasia type i: report of three cases within a family.
AB  == background: dentin dysplasia type i (ddi) is a rare hereditary disturbance of dentin formation. it is characterized by clinically normal-appearing crowns; obliteration of pulp chambers; and short, blunted and malformed roots that are commonly associated with periodontal attachment loss (pal). in this context, we report three cases within a family with similar clinical and radiographic features of ddi but with differing microbiologic and periodontal conditions. methods: a 42-year-old white female and her two daughters (25 and 10 years of age) presented with a diagnosis of ddi. probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), visible plaque, and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded. subgingival biofilm samples were randomly collected and analyzed by checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization. results: the mother presented 34.9% of sites with pd > or  =4 mm, 41.3% of sites with cal > or =4 mm, and 57% of sites with bop; both daughters presented no sites with pd or cal >3 mm and <10% of sites with bop. microbiologic analysis detected gemella morbillorum, neisseria mucosa, and staphylococcus aureus in > or =50% of the mother's samples. the daughters showed  high levels (>10(4) bacterial cells) of some periodontopathic bacteria, including members of the red (porphyromonas gingivalis) and orange (fusobacterium periodonticum and f. nucleatum polymorphum) complexes and beneficial species of the yellow (streptococcus gordonii) and purple (veillonella parvula) complexes. the mother presented high mean levels only for four tested species (n. mucosa, prevotella melaninogenica, treponema denticola, and v. parvula). conclusion: a combination of radiographs, microbiologic analysis, and preventive professional monitoring care is important to avoid pal and to provide oral health in patients  with ddi.

TI  == [periodontitis and cardiovascular disease].
AB  == the prevalence of periodontitis and cardiovascular disease (cvd) is high. a mixed infectious biofilm etiology of periodontitis is known but not fully established in cvd. cofactors; smoking habits, stress, ethnicity, genetics, socioeconomics and age contribute to both diseases. the objectives of this report are to summarize factors in regards to cvd and periodontitis that are clinically relevant. the hypothesis behind a relationship between the two conditions can be  founded in (i) shared infections etiology, (ii) shared inflammatory response, (iii) epidemiological and case-control studies, and (iv) periodontal studies demonstrating improvements of cvd markers. streptococcus species in the s. mitis  group, and s. anginosus group have been identified in periodontitis and are known as pathogens in endocarditis possibly transported from the oral cavity to the heart through bacteremia during dental therapies, and tooth brushing. other periodontal bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and parvimonas micra are beta-lactamase producing and may contribute to antibiotic resistance (extended spectrum beta-lactamases). other bacteria in cvd  and periodontitis include staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. chlamydia pneumoniae and p. gingivalis lipopolyysaccharide capsels share homology and induce heat-shock protein activity and a cascade of proinflammatory cytokines. associations between periodontitis and cvd have been presented in many studies when controlling for confounders. other studies have demonstrated that periodontal therapies increase brachial artery flow rate and reduce serum inflammatory cytokine levels. thus, physicians caring for subjects at cvd risk should consult with dentists/periodontists. dentists must improve their medical knowledge and also learn to consult with physicians when treating patients at cvd risk.

TI  == an ultrastructural study of porphyromonas gingivalis-induced platelet aggregation.
AB  == one of the major pathogens of periodontitis, porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis), has the ability to aggregate human platelets. to investigate the interaction between p. gingivalis and human platelets in platelet rich plasma (prp), platelet aggregation was measured by an aggregometer based on laser light  scattering (ls) methods, and an ultrastructural study was performed using electron microscopy. a sharp and rapid increase of small-sized platelet aggregates was observed immediately after the addition of p. gingivalis to prp, followed by the formation of medium- and large-sized aggregates in 2-3 min. in contrast, when staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) was used in the control experiment, only a slight increase in small-sized aggregates was detected. by electron microscopy, discoid-shaped platelets were observed prior to adding p. gingivalis. by 5 min after the addition of the bacteria, enormous platelet aggregates were observable. most of the p. gingivalis were present between the adherent platelets, while some were internalized in platelet engulfment vacuoles. in contrast, when washed platelets were incubated with the bacteria under a non-stirring condition to prevent platelet aggregation, and stained with ruthenium red (rr) as an electron dense tracer of the cell surface including the  open canalicular system (ocs), both rr-positive and -negative vacuoles containing p. gingivalis were identified in the activated platelets. thus, this observation  suggests that p. gingivalis residing in the rr-negative vacuoles is incorporated  into the platelet cytoplasm by phagocytosis.

AB  == pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (pdtc), an antioxidant with a metal-chelating activity, has been used widely to inhibit the expression of inflammatory genes in vitro and in vivo. this study investigated whether pdtc has an antimicrobial activity against various bacteria. the antibacterial activity of pdtc and other compounds was evaluated in vitro by the broth microdilution method against porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. bacterial growth was inhibited by pdtc, where a wide range of sensitivity was demonstrated among the tested bacteria. the antibacterial activity of pdtc was reduced by the addition of copper chloride; in contrast, it was enhanced considerably by zinc chloride. two different zinc chelators, ca-saturated edta (ca-edta) and n,n,n',n'-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine, blocked the antibacterial activity of pdtc, whereas zn-edta failed to reduce the activity of pdtc. these results demonstrate for the first time that pdtc possesses an antibacterial activity, for which zinc is required, and suggest that pdtc, possessing a dual anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activity, may be considered for topical use for inflammatory diseases of bacterial origin.

TI  == analysis of the antimicrobial activity of local anaesthetics used for dental analgesia.
AB  == seven local anaesthetics and their active anaesthetic components [ultracaine d-s  (articaine hydrochloride), carbostesin (bupivacaine hydrochloride), scandicaine (mepivacaine hydrochloride), xylonest (prilocaine hydrochloride), xylocaine (lidocaine hydrochloride), hostacaine (butanilicaine phosphate) and novocaine (procaine hydrochloride)] were tested for their antimicrobial activity against 311 bacterial strains from 52 different species and 14 candida albicans strains.  the tested pathogens were members of the oral flora, and partly members of the skin and intestinal flora. additionally, the antimicrobial activity of methyl-4-hydroxybenzoate, sodium disulfite, adrenaline hydrogen tartrate and adrenaline (the preservative and vasoconstrictive components of the anaesthetics) was tested. for determination of mic and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc), the agar dilution method using wilkins-chalgren agar was applied. the trade preparation ultracaine d-s showed the most prominent antimicrobial activity with regard to both mic and mbc. ultracaine d-s and its active substance, articaine hydrochloride, showed similar mic values, suggesting that the antimicrobial activity is mainly caused by the anaesthetic component. novocaine showed the lowest antimicrobial activity and did not inhibit 35 of the species tested. the mic values of all local anaesthetics were between 0.25 and 16 mg ml(-1). the routinely applied concentration of ultracaine d-s was roughly four times higher, and of hostacaine was two times higher, than the mbc values for the tested bacteria, whereas for the other anaesthetics, the mbc values were not reached or exceeded with the concentrations used. the mic range of the preservatives was 0.5-1.0 mg ml(-1) for methyl-4-hydroxybenzoate and 0.2-0.5 mg ml(-1) for sodium disulfite. the articaine mic values were two to three serial dilution steps lower, and the butanilicaine mic values one to two serial dilution steps lower, than the mic of the preservatives. the mepivacaine mean mic values were slightly lower for fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and staphylococcus aureus, but higher for streptococcus  intermedius, compared with the preservative methyl-4-hydroxybenzoate. the same result was found with streptococcus intermedius and lidocaine. screening of 20 mic values of 4 pure anaesthetic substances and the corresponding preservative found 2/20 instances where the mics of the preservatives against 5 representative species (67 strains) were lower, indicating that the antimicrobial effect was mainly due to the preservative, but 18/20 results where the pure anaesthetic component showed greater antimicrobial effects compared with the preservative. the in vitro results for carbostesin, scandicaine and especially for novocaine indicate that a local disinfection should be done prior to injection of the anaesthetics. due to the results obtained with nosocomial strains (escherichia coli, s. aureus and pseudomonas), disinfection of the mucous membranes should be  performed routinely in immunocompromised patients, regardless of the anaesthetic  used.

AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to examine the diversity of bacterial  species in the infected root canals of teeth associated with endodontic abscesses by cloning and sequencing techniques in concert with denaturing high-performance  liquid chromatography. methods: samples collected from five infected root canals  were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with universal 16s ribosomal dna primers. products of these pcrs were cloned and sequenced. denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dhplc) was used as a screening method to  reduce the number of clones necessary for dna sequencing. results: all samples were positive for the presence of bacteria and a range of 7-13 different bacteria were found per root canal sample. in total, 48 different oral clones were detected among the five root canal samples. olsenella profusa was the only species present in all samples. porphyromonas gingivalis, dialister pneumosintes, dialister invisus, lachnospiraceae oral clone, staphylococcus aureus, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, peptostreptococcus micros and enterococcus faecalis were found in two of the five samples. the majority of the taxa were present in only one sample, for example tannerella forsythia, shuttleworthia satelles and filifactor alocis. some facultative anaerobes that are frequently isolated from endodontic infections such as e. faecalis, streptococcus anginosus  and lactobacillus spp. were also found in this study. conclusion: clonal analysis of the microflora associated with endodontic infections revealed a wide diversity of oral species.

TI  == production of antagonistic substance by eikenella corrodens isolated from the oral cavity of human beings with and without periodontal disease.
AB  == aims: antagonistic abilities may confer ecological advantages for micro-organisms in competitive ecosystems. however, reports regarding this phenomenon in eikenella corrodens are not available. methods and results: nineteen e. corrodens strains, isolated from the oral cavity of human beings without periodontal disease (n = 5) and with aggressive (n = 9) and chronic (n = 5) periodontitis, as well as a reference strain (e. corrodens atcc23834), were evaluated for antagonistic activity. the following indicators were used: porphyromonas gingivalis fdc381, prevotella intermedia atcc25611, actinomyces israelii atcc12102, eubacterium lentum atcc25559, peptostreptococcus anaerobius atcc27337, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans fdcy4, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc10953, streptococcus sanguinis atcc10557, streptococcus uberis atcc9927, streptococcus mutans im/ufrj, staphylococcus aureus atcc33591 and candida albicans atcc18804. all the strains showed antagonism against at least one of the indicator strains.  this phenomenon was more frequently observed for strains isolated from patients with chronic periodontitis (36.4%), than those from healthy subjects (20.6%) and  those with aggressive periodontitis (10.8%). conclusions: the heterogeneous antagonistic spectrum exhibited by e. corrodens isolates suggests their ability to produce more than one antagonistic substance, whose ecological relevance is yet to be demonstrated. significance and impact of the study: this is the first description of antagonistic compound production by e. corrodens and its relationships with the clinical status of the patients.

TI  == bacterial colonization immediately after installation on oral titanium implants.
AB  == background: information on bacterial colonization immediately after dental implant insertion is limited. aims: (1) to assess the early colonization on titanium implants immediately after placement and throughout the first 12 post-surgical weeks, (2) to compare the microbiota at interproximal subgingival implant and adjacent tooth sites. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples from implant and neighbouring teeth were studied by checkerboard dna-dna  hybridization before surgery, 30 min after implant placement, and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after surgery. results: comparing bacterial loads at implant sites between 30 min after placement with 1-week data showed that only the levels of veillonella parvula (p<0.05) differed with higher loads at week 1 post-surgically. week 12 data demonstrated significantly higher bacterial loads for 15/40 species at tooth sites compared with pre-surgery (p-values varying between 0.05 and 0.01). between the period immediately after surgery and 12 weeks at implant sites, 29/40 species was more commonly found at 12 weeks. included among these bacteria at implant sites were porphyromonas gingivalis (p<0.05), tannerella forsythia, (p<0.01), and treponema denticola (p<0.001). immediately post-surgery 5.9% of implants, and 26.2% of teeth, and at week 12, 15% of implants, and 39.1% of teeth harbored staphylococcus aureus. comparing tooth and  implant sites, significantly higher bacterial loads were found at tooth sites for 27/40 species after 30 min following implant placement. this difference increased to 35/40 species at 12 weeks post-surgically. conclusions: bacterial colonization occurred within 30 min after implant placement. early colonization patterns differed between implant and tooth surfaces.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine against  selected single-species biofilms.
AB  == aim: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of 2.5% and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite and 2.0% chlorhexidine gel and liquid as endodontic-irrigating substances against selected single-species biofilms. methods: single-species biofilms of enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis and fusobacterium nucleatum were generated on a cellulose nitrate membrane placed on  agar medium. the biofilms were then immersed in the endodontic-irrigating substances for 30 s and also for 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 min, with and without mechanical agitation. sterile saline was used as control. after each time period, the membrane filters were then transferred to tubes containing 2 ml of fresh broth medium plus neutralizers (in order to prevent the residual action of the tested substances). the micro-organisms were suspended using a vortex, and the inoculum was serially diluted 10-fold. aliquots of the dilutions were plated on 5% sheep blood agar medium, and incubated under adequate gaseous conditions. colony-forming units were calculated. the samples were compared using the friedman and tukey test, when necessary, at a significance level of p < 0.05. results: mechanical agitation promoted the effectiveness of the antimicrobial agents, resulting in less time to eliminate the same micro-organisms, except for  s. aureus with 2.5% naocl. antimicrobial agents in liquid presentation, especially 5.25% naocl and 2% chlorhexidine, killed the tested micro-organisms more rapidly. saline did not inhibit the growth of any of the tested micro-organisms, with or without agitation, being statistically different (p < 0.05) from naocl and chlorhexidine. p. intermedia, p. gingivalis, p. endodontalis and f. nucleatum were eliminated in 30 s by all antimicrobial agents, with our without agitation, in contrast with the facultative and aerobe strains. conclusions: mechanical agitation improved the antimicrobial properties of the chemical substances tested using a biofilm model, favouring the agents in liquid  presentation, especially 5.25% naocl and 2% chlorhexidine.

TI  == bacteroides species produce vibrio harveyi autoinducer 2-related molecules.
AB  == quorum sensing is a density-dependent gene regulation mechanism that has been described in many bacterial species in the last decades. bacteria that use quorum sensing as part of their gene regulation circuits produce molecules called autoinducers that accumulate in the environment and activate target genes in a quorum-dependent way. some specific clues led us to hypothesize that bacteroides  species can produce autoinducers and possess a quorum sensing system. first, bacteroides are anaerobic bacteria that are frequently involved in polymicrobial  infections. these infections often involve pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, two of the best understood examples of bacteria that employ quorum sensing systems as part of their pathogenesis. also, studies have detected the presence of a quorum sensing gene involved in the production of autoinducers in porphyromonas gingivalis, a species closely related to the bacteroides genus. these and other evidences prompted us to investigate if bacteroides strains could produce autoinducer molecules that could be detected by a vibrio harveyi reporter system. in this paper, we show that supernatants of b.  fragilis, b. vulgatus and b. distasonis strains are able to stimulate the v. harveyi quorum sensing system 2. also, we were able to demonstrate that the stimulation detected is due to the production of autoinducer molecules and not the growth of reporter strains after addition of supernatant. moreover, the phenomenon observed does not seem to represent the degradation of repressors possibly present in the culture medium used. we could also amplify bands from some of the strains tested using primers designed to the luxs gene of escherichia coli. altogether, our results show that b. fragilis, b. vulgatus and b. distasonis (but possibly some other species) can produce v. harveyi autoinducer 2-related molecules. however, the role of such molecules in the biology of these  organisms remains unknown.

AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of points containing antiseptics used for temporary obturation in endodontics. points containing calcium hydroxide (roeko and hygienic), and chlorhexidine (roeko) were tested and gutta-percha points served as control (meta dental corp.). the following microorganisms were studied: streptococcus mutans (sm), enterococcus faecalis (ef), staphylococcus aureus (sta), candida albicans (ca), fusobacterium  nucleatum (fn) atcc 25586, porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) atcc 33277, and prevotella intermedia (pi) atcc 25611. the experiments were organized in three stages: 1st stage: one point of each kind was placed on agar plates previously seeded with microorganisms. 2nd stage: another group of points was immersed in broth for 24 hours and placed on the seeded agar. samples were then incubated at  37 degrees in the conditions of oxygen and for the time required by each microorganism. the zones of bacterial inhibition around each point were measured. the ph values of the broths were recorded. 3rd stage: the immersion broths were inoculated with suspensions of microorganisms, incubated, seeded on plates by dissemination and incubated. cfu counts were performed. results: points containing chlorhexidine showed inhibition zones with every microorganism in the  1st stage and, in the 2nd stage, with most of the microorganisms studied, except  for fn and pi. calcium hydroxide containing points did not inhibit any of the microorganisms assessed. broth ph values did not exhibit any changes. cfu counts  of the broths in which chlorhexidine points had been immersed showed total inhibition for all the microorganisms. the differences between materials were statistically significant (p<0.05) (anova). in the conditions of this study, chlorhexidine-containing points proved to be effective against most of the tested strains.

TI  == pectin-like acidic polysaccharide from panax ginseng with selective antiadhesive  activity against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == previous studies have revealed the inhibitory effects of an acidic polysaccharide purified from the root of panax ginseng against the adhesion of helicobacter pylori to gastric epithelial cells and the ability of porphyromonas gingivalis to agglutinate erythrocytes. in this study, this acidic polysaccharide from p. ginseng, pg-f2, was investigated further, in order to characterize its antiadhesive effects against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, propionibacterium acnes, and staphylococcus aureus. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were found to be in a range of 0.25-0.5mg/ml. however, results showed no inhibitory effects of pg-f2 against lactobacillus acidophilus,  escherichia coli, or staphylococcus epidermidis. pg-f2 is a pectin-type polysaccharide with a mean mw of 1.2 x 10(4) da, and consists primarily of galacturonic and glucuronic acids along with rhamnose, arabinose, and galactose as minor components. the complete hydrolysis of pg-f2 via chemical or carbohydrolase enzyme treatment resulted in the abrogation of its antiadhesive activity, but limited hydrolysis via treatment with pectinase (ec. 3.2.1.15) yielded an oligosaccharide fraction, with activity comparable to the precursor pg-f2 (the mic of ca. 0.01 mg/ml against h. pylori and p. gingivalis). our results suggest that pg-f2 may exert a selective antiadhesive effect against pathogenic bacteria, while having no effects on beneficial and commensal bacteria.

TI  == detection of bacterial dna in atheromatous plaques by quantitative pcr.
AB  == this is the first study to analyze atheromatous plaques for the presence of bacterial dna from ten species, including periodontal species and chlamydia pneumoniae. we examined 129 samples of dna extracted from atheromas from 29 individuals for the presence of bacterial 16s rdna sequences from ten different species: porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), tannerella forsythensis, eikenella corrodens, prevotella intermedia, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans, treponema denticola and c. pneumoniae. all determinations were made using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods employing sybr green. species from the bacteroides family were found in about 17% of the young but approximately 80% in elderly patients. almost half of the samples contained dna from a. a. and c. pneumoniae, although the proportion of the latter was minimal. s. aureus and s. epidermidis were found with the lowest frequency, 5 and 10%, respectively. s. mutans was found in approximately 20% of the samples. the proportions of each bacterial species were calculated relative to the total amount of prokaryotic dna. the data support our previous findings of an association between periodontal organisms and vascular inflammation. we conclude  that dna from oral infectious agents is commonly found in atheromas from young but especially from elderly subjects, and that the contribution of c. pneumoniae  to the inflammation may be minimal.

AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate in vitro the antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide [ca(oh)2] in combination with different vehicles against endodontic pathogens. for such purpose, a broth dilution test was performed. pastes were prepared with ca(oh)2 powder and the following vehicles: sterile water, glycerin, camphorated monochlorophenol (cmcp), cmcp + glycerin, polyethyleneglycol and cmcp + polyethyleneglycol. the time required for the pastes to produce negative cultures against the tested microorganisms was recorded and analyzed statistically using the kruskal wallis test at 5% significance level. timing for pastes to eliminate the aerobic and facultative anaerobic microorganisms ranged from 6 to 24 h, while strict anaerobic microorganisms were inhibited within 30 s to 5 min. microbial susceptibility, ranked from weakest to strongest, can be presented as follows: enterococcus faecalis (the most resistant microorganism), candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis and prevotella intermedia (the last two microorganisms required the same time to be eliminated). in conclusion, calcium hydroxide pastes needed more time to eliminate facultative than anaerobic microorganisms. these findings suggest that the antimicrobial property is related both to paste formulation and to microbial susceptibility.

TI  == sensitization of human aortic endothelial cells to lipopolysaccharide via regulation of toll-like receptor 4 by bacterial fimbria-dependent invasion.
AB  == toll-like receptors (tlrs) are differentially up-regulated in response to microbial infection and chronic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis. epidemiological data support the idea that periodontal disease may be a risk factor for acceleration of atherosclerosis. porphyromonas gingivalis, the etiological agent of periodontal disease, invades endothelium, has been detected  in human atheromatous tissue, and accelerates atheroma formation in apolipoprotein e-/- mice with concurrent induction of tlrs in the aorta. as endothelial cells can present antigen via tlrs and play an important role in the  development of atherosclerosis, we examined tlr expression in human aortic endothelial cells (haec) cultured with wild-type p. gingivalis, a fimbria-deficient mutant, and purified antigens. we observed increased tlr expression in haec infected with wild-type p. gingivalis by fluorescence-activated cell sorter, but not with noninvasive, fimbria-deficient mutant or purified p. gingivalis antigens. following a wild-type p. gingivalis challenge, functional tlr2 and tlr4 activation was assessed by subsequent stimulation with tlr agonists staphylococcus aureus lipoteichoic acid (slta; tlr2 ligand) and escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (lps; tlr4 ligand). unchallenged  haec failed to elicit monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (mcp-1) in response to lps or slta but did so when cultured with wild-type p. gingivalis. p. gingivalis-induced tlr2 and -4 expression on haec functionally reacted to slta and e. coli lps as measured by a further increase in mcp-1 production. furthermore, mcp-1 expression elicited by e. coli lps was inhibitable with tlr4-specific antibody and polymyxin b. these results indicate that invasive p. gingivalis stimulates tlr expression on the surface of endothelium and these primed cells respond to defined tlr-specific ligands.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial and resistance-modifying activities of aqueous crude khat  extracts against oral microorganisms.
AB  == objectives: to assess antimicrobial activities of aqueous crude khat (catha edulis) extracts against a panel of oral microorganisms and to test their ability to modify bacterial resistance to tetracycline and penicillin in vitro. design: lyophilized aqueous extracts were prepared from three khat cultivars. the agar dilution method of the nccls was used to test the extracts, at concentrations of  20-1.25 mg/ml, against 33 oral strains. mic was defined as the lowest concentration at which there was no visible growth. slight growth was defined as  marked growth reduction (mgr). the e-test was used to determine the mics of tetracycline and penicillin-g for three resistant strains in absence and presence of a sub-mic of the khat extracts (5mg/ml). results: eighteen strains (55%) were  sensitive to the extracts (mics 5-20 mg/ml). most of these were periodontal pathogens with porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythensis being the most susceptible (mic 5-10mg/ml). veillonella parvula, actinomyces israelii and some streptococci were not sensitive. except for lactobacillus acidophilus that showed mgr at 1mg/ml, cariogenic species were neither sensitive. the extracts were active against streptococcus pyogenes (mic 10-20 mg/ml) but not against candida albicans and staphylococcus aureus. the presence of the khat extracts at  a sub-mic resulted in a 2-4-fold potentiation of the tested antibiotics against the resistant strains. conclusions: khat has water-soluble constituents possessing selective antibacterial activity against oral bacteria. there is preliminary evidence for presence of an antibiotic resistance-modifying component. further investigation is needed to identify the active components and  assess their clinical relevance.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of croton cajucara benth linalool-rich essential oil on artificial biofilms and planktonic microorganisms.
AB  == we have previously demonstrated that a linalool-rich essential oil from croton cajucara benth presents leishmanicidal activity. in the present study, we demonstrate that this essential oil inhibits the growth of reference samples of candida albicans, lactobacillus casei, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sobrinus, porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus mutans cell suspensions, all of them associated with oral cavity disease. the purified linalool fraction was only inhibitory for c. albicans. microbes of saliva specimens from human individuals with fixed orthodontic appliances, as well as the reference strains,  were used to construct an artificial biofilm which was exposed to linalool or to  the essential oil. as in microbial suspensions, the essential oil was toxic for all the microorganisms, while the purified linalool fraction mainly inhibited the growth of c. albicans. the compounds of the essential oil were separated by thin  layer chromatography and exposed to the above-cited microorganisms. in this analysis, the proliferation of the bacterial cells was inhibited by still uncharacterized molecules, and linalool was confirmed as the antifungal component of the essential oil. the effects of linalool on the cell biology of c. albicans  were evaluated by electron microscopy, which showed that linalool induced a reduction in cell size and abnormal germination. neither the crude essential oil  nor the purified linalool fraction is toxic to mammalian cells, which suggests that the essential oil or its purified components may be useful to control the microbial population in patients with fixed orthodontic appliances.

TI  == susceptibility of some oral microorganisms to chlorhexidine and paramonochlorophenol.
AB  == since the use of antimicrobial agents is required in endodontic therapies, this study aimed at determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of chlorhexidine digluconate and paramonochlorophenol (pmc) against microorganisms commonly found in endodontic infections. both agents were tested by agar dilution tests against pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, candida albicans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella denticola and prevotella melaninogenica. the mic of chlorhexidine ranged from 2.67 to 80.00 microg/ml, and the mic of pmc from 46.67 to 213.33 microg/ml. the highest mic value of pmc was detected for e. faecalis whereas e. coli was the most susceptible microorganism to this agent. the highest mic values of chlorhexidine  were observed for p. aeruginosa whereas e. coli and p. denticola were the most susceptible microorganisms to this agent. since the mic values observed are much  lower than the concentrations currently used in the endodontic therapy, it is suggested that both agents are effective in reducing the microbiota in the root canal.

TI  == activation of the kallikrein-kinin system and release of new kinins through alternative cleavage of kininogens by microbial and human cell proteinases.
AB  == kinins are released from kininogens through the activation of the hageman factor-prekallikrein system or by tissue kallikrein. these peptides exert various biological activities, such as vascular permeability increase, smooth muscle contraction, pain sensation and induction of hypotension. in many instances kinins are thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of various diseases. recent studies have revealed that microbial and human cell proteinases activate hageman factor and/or prekallikrein, or directly release kinin from kininogens. this review discusses the activation of the kinin-release system by mast-cell tryptase and microbial proteinases, including gingipains, which are cysteine proteinases from porphyromonas gingivalis , the major pathogen of periodontal disease. each enzyme is evaluated in the context of its association to allergy and infectious diseases, respectively. furthermore, a novel system of kinin generation directly from kininogens by the concerted action of two proteinases is described. an interesting example of this system with implications to bacterial pathogenicity is the release of kinins from kininogens by neutrophil elastase and a synergistic action of cysteine proteinases from staphylococcus aureus . this alternative production of kinins by proteinases present in diseased sites indicates a significant contribution of proteinases other than kallikreins in kinin generation. therefore kinin receptor antagonists and proteinase inhibitors  may be useful as therapeutic agents.

TI  == effect of porphyromonas gingivalis vesicles on coaggregation of staphylococcus aureus to oral microorganisms.
AB  == vesicles from the outer membrane of porphyromonas gingivalis have the ability to  aggregate a wide range of streptococcus spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces naeslundii, and actinomyces viscosus. we found that in the presence of p. gingivalis vesicles, staphylococcus aureus coaggregated with streptococcus  spp., and the mycelium-type candida albicans, but not the yeast type. autoaggregation of s. aureus in the presence of p. gingivalis vesicles is inhibited by l-arginine, l-lysine, and l-cysteine. both the methicillin-sensitive (mssa) and -resistant (mrsa) strains of s. aureus were able to coaggregate with streptococcus spp., a. naeslundii, and a. viscosus when they were treated with p. gingivalis vesicles. p. gingivalis vesicle-treated mycelium-type c. albicans coaggregated with s. aureus, but the yeast-type did not. these results indicate that strains of s. aureus, including mrsa, could adhere to oral biofilms in dental plaque on the tooth surface or in the gingival crevice when p. gingivalis  is present.

AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate in vitro the antimicrobial activity of 0.2%, 1%, and 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (chx gel and chx liquid), against endodontic pathogens and compare the results with the ones achieved by 0.5%, 1%,  2.5%, 4%, and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (naocl). a broth dilution test was performed, and the timing for irrigants to kill microbial cells was recorded and  statistically analyzed. both 2.0% gel and liquid formulations eliminated staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans in 15 seconds, whereas the gel formulation killed enterococcus faecalis in 1 minute. all tested irrigants eliminated porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia in 15 seconds. the timing required for 1.0% and 2.0% chx liquid to eliminate all microorganisms was the same required for 5.25% naocl. the antimicrobial action is related to type, concentration, and presentation form of  the irrigants as well as the microbial susceptibility.

TI  == the influence of organic load on the antimicrobial activity of different concentrations of naocl and chlorhexidine in vitro.
AB  == aim: to evaluate bacterial growth after contact with sodium hypochlorite (naocl;  1 and 5%) and chlorhexidine (chx; 0.12, 0.5 and 1%) in vitro with or without the  addition of organic material (bovine serum albumin (bsa) 0.5%). methodology: bacterial samples (american type culture collection (atcc)) of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum were kept in contact with each irrigating solution for varying intervals of time: immediately (t0), 5 min (t5), 15 min (t15) and 30 min  (t30). each test was repeated 10 times. in half of the specimens, 0.5% bsa was added as organic material in an attempt to simulate the organic tissue present in the root canal system. bacterial growth under appropriate condition of incubation was evaluated and compared for each microorganism at all time intervals. results: a 0.12% chx solution did not eliminate e. faecalis at any time interval. one percent chx eliminated all strains, as did both naocl concentrations. bsa did not interfere substantially with the antimicrobial activity of any of the irrigating  solutions. conclusions: under the condition of this study, a 0.12% chx solution was ineffective at killing e. faecalis.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of different concentrations of naocl and chlorhexidine using a contact test.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to analyze the in vitro antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite (1% and 5%) and chlorhexidine (0.12%, 0.5% and 1%). bacterial samples (atcc) of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum were submitted to a contact  test. solutions were evaluated at different time intervals: immediately, 5 min, 15 min, and 30 min after contact and repeated 10 times. the results of the contact test showed that 0.12% chlorhexidine did not eliminate e. faecalis at any time interval, while 0.5% and 1% chlorhexidine and 1% and 5% sodium hypochlorite  did. these results permit us to conclude that to obtain better antimicrobial activity, chlorhexidine in a concentration greater than 0.12% should be used.

TI  == antibacterial characteristics of newly developed amphiphilic lipids and dna-lipid complexes against bacteria.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the antibacterial activity of newly  developed amphiphilic lipids and dna/lipid complexes against two types of oral bacteria and two types of hospital infection bacteria. nine amphiphilic lipids were quantitatively prepared from the reaction of n-alkyl alcohol, alpha-amino acids, and p-toluenesulfonic acid. nine dna-lipid complexes were prepared by the  simple mixing of dna and amphiphilic lipids. the dna-lipid complexes were insoluble in water. the antibacterial activity of lipids and dna-lipid complexes  against porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were evaluated by the disk-diffusion method. seven artificial lipids showed antibacterial behavior; in particular, the lipids prepared from n-decyl alcohol and glycine and from n-decyl alcohol and l-alanine  showed antibacterial activity against the four bacterial strains used in this study. on the other hand, the lipids of glutamic acid derivatives did not show any antibacterial activity against the four bacteria strains except for the lipid with an n-octyl group. five dna-lipid complexes also had an antibacterial effect. the complex prepared from dna and glycine decyl ester p-toluenesulfonic acid salt exhibited antibacterial activity against the four types of bacteria strains. in this study it was found that lipids and dna-lipid complexes with a mono-decyl group or a mono-dodecyl group have more favorable antibacterial activity.

TI  == comparison of temporal changes in components of formalin guaiacol under several storage conditions.
AB  == this study examined the effects of storage conditions such as time course, temperature, fluorescent light, and darkness on the components and antibacterial  activity of formalin guaiacol (fg) used in endodontic treatment. we measured the  quantities of formaldehyde and guaiacol in fg and antibacterial activities against staphylococcus aureus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and porphyromonas endodontalis. the components and antibacterial activity of fg in the brown or transparent tightly sealed containers were not affected by temperature or fluorescent light throughout the 4 week test. however, in the loosely sealed containers, formaldehyde and guaiacol in fg sample decreased remarkably within one week, not only in a temperature- and time-dependent manner, but also under fluorescent light at 20 degrees c. furthermore, the antibacterial activities in the fg sample were significantly attenuated in parallel with the decrease in formaldehyde levels. fluorescent light caused color changes and crystallization of fg samples in the transparent containers. these results suggest that it is important to replace fresh fg every 5 to 7 days for endodontic treatment and that, in the dental office, it is advisable to store fresh fg in tightly sealed containers every 2 weeks to maintain its efficacy.

TI  == luxs: its role in central metabolism and the in vitro synthesis of 4-hydroxy-5-methyl-3(2h)-furanone.
AB  == many bacteria produce extracellular molecules which function in cell-to-cell communication. one of these molecules, autoinducer 2 (ai-2), was first described  as an extracellular signal produced by vibrio harveyi to control luciferase expression. subsequently, a number of bacteria have been shown to possess ai-2 activity in their culture supernatants, and bear the luxs gene product, which is  required for ai-2 synthesis. in porphyromonas gingivalis, luxs and pfs, encoding  a 5'-methylthioadenosine/s-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase (mta/sah'ase), form  an operon, suggesting that s-adenosylhomocysteine (sah) or 5'-methylthioadenosine (mta) serves as a substrate for ai-2 production. cell-free extracts of escherichia coli mg1655, but not dh5alpha (which carries a luxs frame-shift mutation) were capable of generating ai-2 activity upon addition of sah, but not  mta. s-ribosyl-homocysteine (rh) derived from sah also served as a substrate in e. coli mg1655 extracts. rh-supplemented cell-free extracts of pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium that lacks luxs, only generated ai-2 activity following the introduction of a plasmid containing the por. gingivalis pfs-luxs operon. in  addition, defined in vitro systems consisting of the purified luxs proteins from  por. gingivalis, e. coli, neisseria meningitidis or staphylococcus aureus converted rh to homocysteine and a compound that exhibits ai-2 activity.4-hydroxy-5-methyl-3(2h)-furanone was identified by mass spectrometry analysis as a major product formed in this in vitro reaction. in e. coli mg1655,  expression of t3sh [the bacteriophage t3 s-adenosylmethionine (sam) hydrolase] significantly reduced ai-2 activity in culture supernatants, suggesting that ai-2 production is limited by the amount of sah produced in sam-dependent transmethylase reactions. the authors suggest that the luxs protein has an important metabolic function in the recycling of sah. they also show that ps. aeruginosa is capable of removing ai-2 activity, implying that this molecule may  act as a nutrient. in many bacteria ai-2 may in fact represent not a signal molecule but a metabolite which is released early and metabolized in the later stages of growth.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers against endodontic pathogens.
AB  == the antibacterial effects of various types of widely used endodontic sealers have not been compared systematically on facultative or obligate anaerobic endodontic  pathogens. the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of  four commonly used endodontic sealers: two epoxy-resin-based sealers (ah26, ah plus), one zinc-oxide eugenol-based sealer (n2), and one calcium hydroxide-based  sealer (sealapex). the testing microbes were four facultative anaerobic species (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus) and four obligate anaerobic species (porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia). the freshly mixed sealers were placed into the prepared wells of agar plates inoculated with the test microorganisms. after varying periods of incubation (2 days for facultative anaerobic species and 7 days for obligate anaerobic species), the zones of growth inhibition were observed and measured. all the sealers were distinctly different from each other in their antimicrobial  activity. the sealers showed different inhibitory effects depending on the types  and bacterial strains. n2 containing formaldehyde and eugenol proved to be the most effective against the microorganisms. the extreme antimicrobial potency of this root canal sealer must be weighted against its pronounced tissue toxic effect.

TI  == mouthrinses: a comparative microbiological study.
AB  == this study was performed in order to evaluate the efficacy of different mouthrinses whose use is extended in spain. six different antiseptic mouthrinses  were studied by means of determination of minimal inhibitory concentration (mic)  values against klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus mutans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. also in vivo experiments were carried out in volunteers by the use of mouthrinses and evaluation of bacterial populations before and after the treatment. finally, the kinetics of bacterial death was determined. results suggested that the determination of mic values is not a reliable method to evaluate the antibacterial effect of such products. on the other hand those rinsing solutions based on the effect of oxygen, such as those containing carbamide peroxide have a greater efficacy against anaerobic bacteria compared with rinses whose active molecule is a disinfectant. finally, the kinetics of bacterial death demonstrates that the essential oil rinse kills bacteria much faster. all tested mouthrinses were active as antibacterial although those based on oxygen production or essential oils were more active than solutions based on chlorhexidine and triclosan.

TI  == bacterial fimbriae and their peptides activate human gingival epithelial cells through toll-like receptor 2.
AB  == gingival epithelial cells are a central component of the barrier between oral microflora and internal tissues. host responses to periodontopathic bacteria and  surface components containing fimbriae are thought to be important in the development and progression of periodontal diseases. to elucidate this mechanism, we established immortalized human gingival epithelial cells (hgec) that were transfected with human papillomavirus. hgec predominantly expressed toll-like receptor (tlr) 2, but not tlr4 or cd14. they also induced interleukin-8 (il-8) production when stimulated with porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae and staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan, but not escherichia coli-type synthetic lipid a. furthermore, an active synthetic peptide composed of residues 69 to 73 (altte) of the fimbrial subunit protein, derived from p. gingivalis and similar to a common component of cell wall peptidoglycans in parasitic bacteria, n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-isoglutamine (mdp), significantly induced il-8 production and nf-kappab activation in hgec, and these cytokine-producing activities were augmented by a complex of soluble cd14 and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (lbp). il-8 production in hgec stimulated with these bacterial components was clearly inhibited by mouse monoclonal antibody to  human tlr2. these findings suggest that p. gingivalis fimbrial protein and its active peptide are capable of activating hgec through tlr2.

TI  == microflora in oral ecosystems in primary sjogren's syndrome.
AB  == objective: knowledge of the effect of primary sjogren's syndrome (pss) on the microbial flora in the different predilection sites for oral disorders is needed  for planning preventive treatment. we carried out microbial analysis of samples from the dorsum of the tongue, smooth mucosa, supragingival tooth surfaces, and the gingival crevice region of 20 patients with pss. methods: a clinical oral examination was performed and whole unstimulated and stimulated secretion rates were measured. results: compared with healthy controls, subjects with pss harbored higher numbers and frequencies of streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp., and candida albicans in the supragingival plaque. on the smooth mucosa and  tongue, the pss subjects displayed an increased frequency of c. albicans, staphylococcus aureus, enterics, and enterococci. c. albicans was detected about  twice as frequently in the supragingival plaque as it was on the tongue. in the gingival crevice region, the pss group harbored slightly lower proportions of fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens than controls. the clinical and microbial differences were mainly due to the pss subjects with a stimulated secretion rate of < 0.5 ml/min. porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were not detected in any subject with pss. conclusion: the microbial flora in the different ecosystems reflected the status of oral disorders in the subjects with pss. specific site sampling and analysis in subjects with pss revealed further differences compared  with controls, and is therefore preferable to saliva sampling for oral treatment  planning and for the evaluation of the effect of oral treatment and of preventive measures implemented in individuals with pss.

TI  == humoral immunity host factors in subjects with failing or successful titanium dental implants.
AB  == background: treatment with titanium dental implants is in general successful. however, an unknown number of implants do not integrate and are removed either by exfoliation or at the time of second stage surgery. it would be of importance to  identify subjects at risk and predict early implant failure. methods: in a retrospective study serum igg antibody titers and avidity in sera from 40 subjects who had experienced titanium dental implant treatments with non-osseo-integration as the outcome (noti) and in sera from 40 age and gender matched control subjects who had received successful titanium dental implants (soti) were studied. serum igg titers to whole cell actinomyces viscosus, bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus intermedius sonicated antigen preparations were studied by elisa. results: serum igg antibody titers to s. aureus were significantly higher in subjects with soti than in noti (p<0.001) suggesting that higher titers indicate  protection against implant failure as a result of s. aureus infection. statistically significant higher serum igg antibody avidity to p. gingivalis and  b. forsythus were found in subjects with soti than in subjects with noti (p<0.01  and p<0.001, respectively). statistical analysis failed to demonstrate antibody titer or avidity differences to the other pathogens studied. the likelihood that  soti was associated with a high od reading for s. aureus was 13.1:1 (p<0.001). whether subjects were edentulous or not, or if they had lost teeth because of periodontitis or caries did not seem to matter. conclusion: serum igg antibodies  relative to b. forsythus, p. gingivalis and s. aureus may be associated with the  outcome of implant procedures and explain why early implant failures occur.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis dpp-7 represents a novel type of dipeptidylpeptidase.
AB  == a novel dipeptidylpeptidase (dpp-7) was purified from the membrane fraction of porphyromonas gingivalis. this enzyme, with an apparent molecular mass of 76 kda, has the specificity for both aliphatic and aromatic residues in the p1 position.  although it belongs to the serine class of peptidases, it does not resemble other known dipeptidylpeptidases. interestingly, the amino acid sequence around the putative active site serine residue shows significant similarity to the c-terminal region of the staphylococcus aureus v-8 endopeptidase. the genes encoding homologues of dpp-7 were found in genomes of xylella fastidiosa, shewanella putrefaciens, and p. gingivalis. it is likely that at least in p. gingivalis, dpp-7 and its homologue, in concert with other di- and tripeptidases, serve nutritional functions by providing dipeptides to this asaccharolytic bacterium.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and arnica montana against oral pathogens.
AB  == arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. they possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. also, the antimicrobial activity of arnica has not been extensively investigated. therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by arnica and propolis extracts. arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from minas gerais state were compared with controls. fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: candida albicans--ntcc 3736, f72; staphylococcus aureus--atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis--atcc 29212;  streptococcus sobrinus 6715; strep. sanguis--atcc 10556; strep. cricetus--hs-6; strep. mutans--ingbritt 1600; strep. mutans--omz 175; actinomyces naeslundii--atcc 12104, w 1053; act. viscosus omz 105; porphyromonas gingivalis;  porph. endodontalis and prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. to assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30  degree angle. to assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 m sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. the propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for actinomyces spp. the arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. the arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for strep. mutans and 15% for strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same  concentrations. thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.

TI  == possible potentiation of toxins from prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and porphyromonas gingivalis by cotinine.
AB  == background: smoking is a recognized risk factor for the initiation and progression of periodontitis. however, the mechanism by which smoking induces its negative effects on the periodontium is not clear. this study aimed to test the hypothesis that synergy may occur between cotinine and bacterial products isolated from 3 putative periodontopathogens. methods: a chick embryo toxin assay was used to investigate bacterial toxins (cell-free extracellular toxins and cell-free cell lysates) from 5 species with and without cotinine. a total of 9 putative periodontopathogens (3 species) and 2 non-oral controls (2 species) were studied. the periodontal species were: prevotella intermedia (n = 4), prevotella  nigrescens (n = 4), and porphyromonas gingivalis (n = 1). the control species tested were: staphylococcus aureus (n = 1) and escherichia coli (n = 1). results: the toxicity kill was significantly greater than expected by simple addition alone (p <0.05, fisher's exact test) between cotinine (800 ng/ml) and 1) the cell-free extracellular toxins of p. nigrescens mh1 and 2) the cell-free cell lysates of p. intermedia mh2. synergy occurred with cotinine plus the cell-free extracellular toxins in all but 3 periodontal isolates, and the cell-free cell lysates in all but 2 periodontal isolates. cotinine significantly (p <0.05, fisher's exact test) enhanced the effects of cell-free extracellular toxins and cell lysates from one control species (e. coli), but not the other (s. aureus). conclusions: these findings indicate that synergy in an in vitro assay can occur  between cotinine and toxins from putative periodontopathogens. this may be one important mechanism by which smoking increases the severity of periodontitis.

TI  == bacteriostatic effects of hyaluronic acid.
AB  == background: this investigation is one of a series of projects seeking to ascertain whether hyaluronic acid (ha) is therapeutically effective in tissue regeneration procedures. the rationale for these investigations is to test the hypothesis that ha can serve as a bioabsorbable carrier for other substrates as well as itself actively promote the regeneration of tissue. methods: in this paper, we report on the bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties of 3 molecular weight formulations of recombinant ha (low, 141 kd; medium, 757 kd; and high, 1,300 kd) on selected oral and non-oral microorganisms in the planktonic phase. three concentrations of each ha formulation were screened, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/ml, using a standard broth culture assay. results: recombinant ha exerted varied bacteriostatic effects on all the bacterial strains tested depending on its molecular weight (mw) and concentration. the high concentrations of the medium mw ha had the greatest bacteriostatic effect, particularly on the actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella oris, staphylococcus aureus, and propionibacterium acnes strains. the 1.0 mg/ml concentration of high mw ha had the greatest overall bacteriostatic effect, inhibiting the growth of all 6 bacterial strains tested. among the bacterial strains studied, ha was found to have no bactericidal effects, regardless of concentration or molecular weight. conclusions: the results of this study suggest that ha in the mw range of 1,300 kd may prove beneficial in minimizing bacterial contamination of surgical wounds  when used in guided tissue regeneration surgery.

AB  == this study presents the composition of the cultivable microbiota colonising periodontal pockets of different depths among 2 patient-groups classified as non-responsive (nr-group; 11 participants) or responsive (r-group; 10 participants) to periodontal treatment. microbiological samples from three types  of pocket (< 4 mm deep a-samples; 4-5 mm b-samples; > 5 mm c-samples) were analysed by cultural methods for putative periodontitis pathogens, microbial groups constituting > or = 5% of the total cultivable flora and opportunistic pathogens. actinomyces naeslundii, a. israelii, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium spp, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, anaerobic streptococci and facultative anaerobic streptococci were most prevalent. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, staphylococcus aureus, enteric rods and yeasts were less prevalent. the periodontitis pathogens bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium spp, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and peptostreptococcus micros constituted together (on average) < or = 23% of the viable counts in the a- and b-samples of  both patient groups and in the c-samples of the r-group. in the c-samples of the  nr-group their mean counts were 45%. correlations were found between smoking habits and the five pathogens in the c-samples and in pooled pocket depth samples. the results show that groups of periodontopathogens should be considered a causal factor in therapy-resistant periodontitis. further, smoking and deep pockets can enhance a shift in the balance of the subgingival microflora predisposing a site to disease and a susceptible host may be the pre-requisite to therapy-resistant periodontitis.

TI  == clinical and microbiological characteristics of smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  == cigarette smoking is a potential risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. the objective of this study was to compare  the microbial profile of smokers and non-smokers in a group of patients with early onset periodontitis. the study population consisted of 60 healthy individuals, 40 males and 20 females aged 22 to 35 yr, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. thirty patients were smokers (30.9 cigarettes/d) and 30 non-smokers. smokers had a higher proportion of deep pockets (pd >5 mm), especially in the maxilla anterior and premolar regions (p < 0.001) and presented a significantly greater mean probing depth and attachment loss (p <0.05) in diseased sites and a significantly greater alveolar bone loss (p <0.01) compared  to non-smokers. two pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. samples were collected from the deepest periodontal pockets of each quadrant. the samples were cultured anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits.  smokers harboured a greater number of bacteria in total. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann-whitney u-test) showed that staphylococcus aureus, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, escherichia coli, bacteroides  forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, selenomonas sputigena, candida albicans and aspergillus fumigatus were found in significantly higher numbers and more frequently in smokers while streptococcus intermedius, a. naeslundii, a. israelii and eubacterium lentum were detected more frequently and  in significantly higher proportions in non-smokers. the isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora such as e. coli, c. albicans, a. fumigatus and s. aureus in smokers' microbiota underscores the importance of the host that is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.

TI  == multiparameter flow cytometric analysis of polymorphonuclear leucocytes in whole  blood from patients with adult rapidly progressive periodontitis reveals low expression of the adhesion molecule l-selectin (cd62l).
AB  == numerous studies of polymorphonuclear leucocyte (pmn) function in patients with adult periodontitis, including rapidly progressive periodontitis, have yielded conflicting findings, perhaps because most of the assays were performed on pmns that had been separated from whole blood by a variety of procedures. to avoid the problems associated with in vitro analysis of isolated cells, pmn function and antigen expression in live whole unmanipulated blood of eight patients with rapidly progressive periodontitis were compared with those of age-, race-, and sex-matched controls. using multiparameter flow cytometry, a) l-selectin (cd62l)  expression, b) cell size, and c) respiratory burst activity were measured in pmns in whole blood immediately ex vivo and during incubation with porphyromonas gingivalis and staphylococcus aureus. by comparison with pmns from the control group, pmns from the patient group expressed significantly lower levels of cd62l  and had an increased size before stimulation. pmns from both groups produced respiratory bursts similar to those of the two bacteria, but in both groups the responses to s. aureus were significantly greater than those to p. gingivalis. the significantly reduced expression of the adhesion molecule cd62l on pmns in the patient group may lead to reduced tethering of neutrophils at sites of inflammation and may partly explain the susceptibility of these individuals to recurrent and severe periodontal infections.

TI  == the efficacy of antimicrobial mouth rinses in oral health care.
AB  == there is growing public recognition of the importance of oral health, as symbolized by the theme. "oral health for a healthy life" proposed for the 1994 world health day. in this report, the efficacy of antimicrobial mouth rinses, mainly listerine, was reviewed by three investigators who are working as a microbiologist, a microbiologist, a dentist, and a dental hygienist participating in oral health care. listerine, an antimicrobial mouth rinse, completely killed microorganisms in 10 to 30 seconds; the microbes includes methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, helicobacter pylori, candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. listerine was also weakly effective in inactivating human immunodeficiency viruses. bacteria in samples collected from human dental plaque and saliva were completely killed within 30 seconds when exposed to listerine. when saliva samples were collected from subjects who had rinsed their mouths with 20 ml of listerine or 1:50 diluted povidone-iodine, levels of viable anaerobic bacteria in the samples were reduced  to 1%. when listerine was used for oral surgery such as tooth extraction and periodontal surgery, the agent was effective in relieving toothache. this was probably due to a decrease in oral bacteria by the antimicrobial action of listerine, leading to lowering the inflammatory response of the host. the use of  antimicrobial mouth rinse during dental treatments such as endodontic treatment proved effective for more reliable infection control. in japan, there are an increasing number of elderly and medically compromised hosts who are potentially  at risk for developing pneumonia due to silent aspiration of microbes in the oral cavity and throat. for the aged with such potential risk, using of antimicrobial  mouth rinse may be effective in preventing dental plaque accumulation when used in addition to the mechanical control of plaque, since they tend to have difficulty in brushing teeth by themselves. indeed, the use of antimicrobial mouth rinse in these elderly people proved useful not only in preventing bacterial pneumonia, but also in improving their quality of life by preserving their oral health.

TI  == inactivation of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor as a broad screen for detecting proteolytic activities in unknown samples.
AB  == the need for a quick, simple screening method for the detection of general proteolytic activity prompted us to determine whether cleavage within the reactive site loop region (rsl) of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha1-pi), a well-characterized member of the serpin family known to be susceptible to proteolytic inactivation, can be utilized for this purpose. inactivation of alpha1-pi in the rsl region can be measured by loss of residual inhibitory capacity of alpha1-pi against its target proteinase. while we originally utilized this assay to detect a new proteinase from culture supernatants of porphyromonas  gingivalis, the feasibility of extending this assay to scan for proteolytic activity from other systems was also assessed. as an example, we found that the serine proteinase from staphylococcus aureus (ssp) had virtually the same catalytic efficiency in inactivating alpha1-pi in our assay as it did in the hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate z-phe-leu-glu-pna (kcat/km value of 2 x 10(4) m-1 s-1 vs 2.6 x 10(4) m-1 s-1, respectively). additionally, in both assays activity could be readily detected in less than a 1 h incubation at ssp concentrations in the picomolar range. this assay is unique in that proteinases which hydrolyze peptide bonds within the rsl of alpha1-pi can readily be detected as measured by loss of alpha1-pi inhibitory activity.

AB  == the number of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was determined in the saliva of 20 children with acute group a beta-haemolytic streptococcal (gabhs) pharyngo-tonsillitis, and 20 with acute non-gabhs tonsillitis. antibody titres to four gram-negative anaerobic bacilli that reside in the oropharynx (fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) were determined in these and 20 control patients. an average of 8.8 aerobic and anaerobic isolates per patient saliva specimens were found during the acute tonsillitis stage in both groups, and 6.9 (in gabhs tonsillitis) and 5.6 (in non-gabhs tonsillitis) 5-6 weeks later. there were 10- to 1000-fold more bacteria in the acute stages of the inflammation in both gabhs  and non-gabhs groups. these bacteria were staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, peptostreptococcus spp., f. nucleatum, prevotella spp. and porphyromonas spp. significantly higher antibodies levels to  f. nucleatum and p. intermedia were found in the second serum sample of patients  with non-gabhs pharyngo-tonsillitis (p < 0.001) and gabhs tonsillitis (p < 0.05), as compared with their first sample or the levels of antibodies in controls. the  increase in the number of several aerobic and anaerobic bacteria during acute tonsillitis and the increase in antibody levels to f. nucleatum and p. intermedia, known oral pathogens, may suggest a possible pathogenic role for these organisms in acute non-gabhs and gabhs tonsillitis.

TI  == subgingival microflora in smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  == cigarette smoking is a potent risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. the objective of this study was to detect the microbial profile of early onset periodontitis in smokers and compare it to that  of non-smokers. the study population consisted of 50 systemically healthy individuals aged 25 to 38 years, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. 25 patients were smokers (> 20 cigarettes/day) and 25 non-smokers. two pooled bacterial samples comprised of four periodontal sites with probing depth > 5 mm each, were collected from each individual. the samples were cultured aerobically  and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. the differences in bacterial counts using  the mann whitney u test were statistically significant for staphylococcus aureus, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens, escherichia coli, bacteroides forsythus, bacteroides gracilis, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis,  selenomonas sputigena and candida albicans in smokers. statistically significant  differences for peptostreptococcus micros, actinomyces naeslundii, eubacterium lentum and capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in non-smokers. the isolation  of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora like e. coli, c. albicans and s. aureus in smokers microflora underscores the importance of the host which is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.

TI  == periodontal microflora of hiv infected patients with periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the microbial profile of periodontal lesions in hiv seropositive patients and to compare it with rapidly progressing periodontal lesions in systemically healthy patients. the subgingival microflora  of 20 cdc ii, 20 cdc iii, 20 cdc iv/v and 20 systemically healthy patients with rapidly progressing periodontitis was examined. four sites with greatest probing  depth in each patient were selected for microbiological sampling. the samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. the microflora of periodontitis lesions within the three stages of the hiv infection was similar to that of progressing periodontitis in systemically healthy adults including campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, selenomonas spp. and peptostreptococcus micros. however, hiv seropositive periodontitis lesions harboured a range of exogenous pathogens rarely associated with common types of periodontitis including staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloaca, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus avium, clostridium difficile, aspergillus fumigatus, klebsiella pneumoniae and mycoplasma incognitum. the lack of immune effector and regulatory cells in hiv infected patients could in fact explain the increase of some opportunistic pathogens and the characteristic and rapidly progressing nature of the periodontal disease in these patients.

TI  == extracts of periodontopathic microorganisms lack functional superantigenic activity for murine t cells.
AB  == products of periodontopathic bacteria exert immunomodulatory effects on various lymphoid cell populations, some of which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. it has recently been suggested that some of these bacterial products may possess superantigenic (sag) activity. sag bind simultaneously to the v beta chain of t cell receptors and to class ii major histocompatibility complex molecules, thereby activating as many as 35% of t cells to proliferate and produce cytokines. in order to examine this question, the proliferation of splenic and thymic t cells from immunologically naive, 3-6-wk-old balb/c (h-2d),  c57bl/6 (h-2b) and c3h/hej (h-2k) mice was assessed in response to sonic extracts of periodontopathogens. laboratory and/or reference strains of a.o. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens were used as stimulants. staphylococcal enterotoxin b (seb), a known superantigen, was utilized as a positive control. unfractionated spleen cells responded to several of the tested preparations of the different bacteria, as well as to seb, con a and escherichia coli lps. thymocytes responded to con a and seb, but not to lps or to any sonic extract. spleen cells depleted of b cells by panning responded to seb and con a, but not to lps and showed a reduced response to sonicates. the residual response of b cell-depleted spleen cells was reduced essentially to background by treatment with anti-thy 1.2 + c'. similar results were obtained in the presence of 5% added mitomycin-treated antigen presenting cells, indicating that these cells were not  limiting. these results demonstrate that extracts of periodontopathic bacteria do not stimulate murine t cells in a manner consistent with superantigenic activation.

TI  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans on denture surfaces.
AB  == infectious diseases caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, mrsa,  and candida albicans are often serious in compromised hosts. we enumerated mrsa and c. albicans on denture surfaces and in saliva samples from 29 adults. staphylococcus species, mrsa, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, mrse, were detected on 17, 3, and 1 of the 29 denture surfaces, respectively. c. albicans were detected on 22 denture surfaces. all saliva samples from patients whose dentures carried staphylococcus species and c. albicans were also found to contain both microorganisms. adherence of isolated 3h labeled cells of mrsa and c. albicans to resin beads and saliva-coated resin beads was examined. cells of both microorganisms adhered in significantly higher  numbers to saliva-coated resin beads than to resin beads. the hydrophobicity of the mrsa isolated from denture surfaces varied from strain to strain; that of c.  albicans strains was moderately high. the zeta potentials of mrsa isolates and of c. albicans isolates determined in kci buffer were significantly low. the potential of the resin beads decreased after treatment with saliva. two out of 5  mrsa strains were found to be inhibited in growth by oral streptococcus, actinomyces, and gram-negative bacterial strains, suggesting that some oral bacterial species play a role in inhibiting the colonization of staphylococcus species. no isolates of c. albicans were inhibited in their growth by any of the  oral bacteria tested. isolates of mrsa and c. albicans coaggregated with porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum strains. using denture cleaners every night for 2 weeks did not reduce numbers of staphylococcus species or c. albicans organisms in saliva.

TI  == antagonistic effect of oral bacteria towards treponema denticola.
AB  == this study was designed to isolate oral bacteria exhibiting antagonism towards treponema denticola and to characterize the inhibitory activity. eleven bacterial isolates obtained from subgingival sites and identified as either staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus mutans were found to inhibit the growth of t. denticola.  when the activity spectra of these isolates were analyzed, two additional periodontopathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) were found to be affected, whereas most gram-positive bacteria were not. strains of s. aureus produce a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (heat stable and protease  sensitive), whereas the inhibitory effect of s. mutans appears to be related to the production of lactic acid. the negative interactions reported in this paper may govern population shifts observed in subgingival sites.

TI  == the interference of gingival cell cultures with growth of selected bacteria.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to analyze the interference of oral tissue cells or cell lines (effector cells) with growth of reference bacteria, and furthermore to investigate whether cells derived from different individuals differ in such activity. the reference bacteria were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the effector cells used were gingival fibroblasts (gf) from 21 periodontally involved persons, gingival epithelial cells (e) from 2 such persons, hela cells (hela), and an amnion cell line (amnion). the cells were cultivated and their supernatants tested for antibacterial activity in a bioscreen robot analyzer (labsystems, finland). results suggest that the antibacterial activity of each tested primary cell line  of tissue had its own profile depending on cell type and donor, and that the composition of oral microbiota was influenced by oral cells, which might, in turn, contribute to the variations in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.

TI  == occurrence of enteric rods, staphylococci and candida in subgingival samples.
AB  == the frequency and percentage of enteric rods, staphylococci and candida were determined in 973 subgingival samples collected from 535 patients subjected to different periodontal treatment procedures. the analysis was performed with culture technique using selective and nonselective media. one or more organisms were detected in 65.5% of the samples and in 76.7% of the patients. in most samples enteric rods, staphylococci and/or candida constituted a small amount of  the total microbial viable count. enteric rods exceeded 10% of the total viable count in 30 samples. staphylococci occurred in more than 10% in only 3 samples. in these 3 samples, enterics constituted more than 10% of the total viable count. candida was not found to exceed 10% of the total viable count in any of the samples. no statistically significant correlation was found between the presence  of any of the target microorganisms and kind of periodontal treatment procedure received, antibiotic administration or sample transport time.

TI  == bacterial interference in vitro. comparison between a quantitative kinetic and a  cocultivation blood agar test method.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to compare two methods for estimation of bacterial growth interference between various bacteria using a bioscreen robot analyzer, allowing kinetic documentation, and a cocultivation test on blood agar  plates. six laboratory strains with different virulence and growth requirements were used: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mitis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. the interference activity was correlated with a reference system of streptococcus sanguis (strain alpha 89) and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococci, gas serotypes t 9 and t 22). the methods used and results obtained were as follows: 1. estimation of synergistic and antagonistic bacterial interferences using a bioscreen robot analyzer. suspensions of viable bacteria were added to microtiter plates with different concentrations of uv light-killed bacteria in liquid media. the bioscreen analyzer monitored bacterial growth every 10 min for 24 h giving kinetic data during the growth period. synergisms as well as antagonisms were demonstrated between the tested bacterial  strains which have not earlier been reported in the literature. however, the antagonistic effect observed between the six strains was less than that induced by the s. sanguis strain on the two strains of s. pyogenes. 2. cocultivation of bacterial strains on blood agar surface with precultivated or simultaneously stamped interfering bacteria indicated no detectable interference between the six tested bacterial strains, while the s. sanguis strain inhibited the growth of s.  pyogenes strains as well as the hemolysis around the colonies. the bioscreen method was found more sensitive for testing bacterial interference compared to the commonly used blood agar test.

TI  == cytotoxicity in bacterial cultures: interaction and cell-specificity, possible factors in periodontal disease.
AB  == cytotoxicity in culture media of various growing bacterial strains was estimated  by cr-51 release of labelled target-cells. interaction studies were made by adding each of the different uv-killed bacteria to the medium with viable bacteria. the reference oral bacterial strains were: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus mitis, which were compared with the reference bacteria staphylococcus aureus 209 and staphylococcus epidermidis. the target cells were:  gingival fibroblasts (gf), periodontal membrane fibroblasts (pmf), pulpal fibroblasts (pf), hela-cells (hela), and lymphoid neoplasm cells (ln). synergistic, as well as antagonistic, effects on target cells were observed. the  cytotoxicity of a. actinomycetemcomitans in presence of p. gingivalis is neutralized while in presence of s. aureus it was increased. bacterial interactions with f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis cytotoxicity were observed. the  cytotoxicity of f. nucleatum was increased when cultured together with a. actinomycetemcomitans. each cell type reacted differently to the toxicity of the  supernatant of growth medium in which the same bacterial strain had been cultivated, which indicates cell specificity of the toxins.

TI  == role of suspected periodontopathogens in microbiological monitoring of periodontitis.
AB  == periodontal disease is the clinical result of a complex interaction between the host and plaque bacteria. although a specificity to some degree is found for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp), it has been difficult to obtain evidence for a specific etiological role of the bacteria associated with periodontal disease in adults. what we see is the net result of host-parasite interactions which in an unpredictable moment accumulate  and exceed the threshold of tissue integrity. this hypothesis is concomitant with the view of periodontal disease as a polymicrobial infection, predominantly anaerobic, which occurs commonly in the oral cavity or elsewhere in the body. some micro-organisms (risk markers) occur more frequently than others and may significantly determine the outcome of this host-parasite interaction. microbiological sampling and analysis seem to be of limited value in risk assessment; however, they can be used as tools in diagnosis in ljp patients and acute infections, and in treatment decision and therapy control in "refractory" patients. suspected pathogens (risk markers) are actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and some species of spirochetes, while the roles of prevotella intermedia, bacteroidesforsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, and peptostreptococcus micros are more uncertain. the presence of periodontopathogens as well as enterics, staphylococcus aureus and candida especially, should be considered in patients with systemic individual disorders--e.g., diabetes mellitus, neutropenia, agranulocytosis, and aids--or with implants.

TI  == microbial composition and pattern of antibiotic resistance in subgingival microbial samples from patients with refractory periodontitis.
AB  == a series of 993 subgingival microbial samples sent to a diagnostic microbiology laboratory included 196 samples that could be identified as compatible with a clinical diagnosis of refractory or recurrent periodontitis. in descending order  of prevalence the associated microbiota included bacteroides forsythus (84%), spirochetes (83%), motile rods (76%), fusobacterium species (68%), porphyromonas  gingivalis (63%), campylobacter rectus (47%), capnocytophaga species (38%), prevotella intermedia (23%), peptostreptococcus micros (18%), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (16%), candida (14%), enteric rods (9%), staphylococcus species, not including aureus (5.6%). eikenella corrodens (3%), staphylococcus aureus (1.5%), and enterococcus species (< 1%). antibiotic resistance to tetracycline, penicillin g, or metronidazole was particularly noticeable for enteric rods, fusobacterium species, capnocytophaga species, staphylococcus, and  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. it was largely absent for campylobacter rectus. no antibiotic sensitivity data were obtained for porphyromonas gingivalis or bacteroides forsythus, as these species were detected by immunofluorescence. the results indicate that a substantial number of microorganisms associated with  refractory periodontitis are variably resistant to commonly-used antibiotics. diagnostic microbiology must be considered an essential adjunct to the therapist  faced with periodontal lesions refractory to conventional treatment.

TI  == expression of fc-gamma-riii and fibronectin in peripheral polymorphonuclear neutrophils with increased response to fc stimulation in patients with juvenile periodontitis.
AB  == the nature of increased luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence (cl) in peripheral polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn) in juvenile periodontitis is of pathophysiological interest and may serve as a model for tissue damage caused by  granulocytes. activation of pmns by opsonized staphylococcus aureus was compared  with that of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides gingivalis, regarded as being more specific for juvenile periodontitis. the cl was higher in  the pmns from the patients, independently of bacteria and mode of opsonization (autologous serum or gamma-globulin). fc-gamma-riii assessed on the washed fragments from peripheral pmns was significantly (p < or = 0.005) lower in the patients with juvenile periodontitis than in their pair-matched healthy controls, while the content of fibronectin was higher (p < or = 0.032). however, when fc-gamma-riii and fibronectin were studied in fresh pmns by flow cytometry no difference could be found between the two groups. the increased generation of cl  of peripheral pmns found in patients with juvenile periodontitis seems to be independent of humoral factors and of bacterial species and may be related to the properties of the pmn cell membranes.

TI  == refractory periodontitis associated with abnormal polymorphonuclear leukocyte phagocytosis and cigarette smoking.
AB  == to learn if refractory periodontitis may be associated with defects in peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocyte (pmn) function, phagocytosis and chemotaxis were analyzed in 31 otherwise healthy patients and 12 unaffected controls. when compared to controls, no chemotactic defects to 10 nm f-met-leu-phe (fmlp) were detected. in contrast, phagocytosis was significantly impaired (p < 0.001). the mean rates of adhesion and ingestion of opsonized staphylococcus aureus by pmns were 7.1 +/- 1.7 (+/- sd) and 1.4 +/- 0.5 bacteria/100 pmns/minute respectively for patients, and 11.0 +/- 2.4 and 3.1 +/- 0.6 for unaffected, healthy controls.  while the quality of oral hygiene and access to dental care were high, a retrospective search for associated environmental variables showed that 90% (28 of 31) of the refractory patients were smokers. the frequency of smokers is particularly striking, since only 21% of adults in minnesota use tobacco regularly. these data suggest that there is a strong association between a peripheral blood pmn defect and refractory periodontitis. furthermore, these studies suggest that tobacco use may contribute to this association.
