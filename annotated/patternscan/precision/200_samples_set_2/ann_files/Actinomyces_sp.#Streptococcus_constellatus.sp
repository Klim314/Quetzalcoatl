TI  == the predominant bacteria isolated from radicular cysts.
AB  == purpose: to detect predominant bacteria associated with radicular cysts and discuss in light of the literature. material and methods: clinical materials were obtained from 35 radicular cysts by aspiration. cultures were made from clinical  materials by modern laboratory techniques, they underwent microbiologic analysis. results: the following are microorganisms isolated from cultures: streptococcus milleri group (smg) (23.8%) [streptococcus constellatus (19.1%) and streptococcus anginosus (4.7%)], streptococcus sanguis (14.3%), streptococcus mitis (4.7%), streptococcus cremoris (4.7%), peptostreptococcus pevotii (4.7%), prevotella buccae (4.7%), prevotella intermedia (4.7%), actinomyces meyeri (4.7%), actinomyces viscosus (4.7%), propionibacterium propionicum (4.7%), bacteroides capillosus (4.7%), staphylococcus hominis (4.7%), rothia denticariosa (4.7%), gemella haemolysans (4.7%), and fusobacterium nucleatum (4.7%). conclusions: results of this study demonstrated that radicular cysts show a great variety of anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial flora. it was observed that all isolated microorganisms were the types commonly found in oral flora. although no  specific microorganism was found, streptococcus spp. bacteria (47.5%) - especially smg (23.8%) - were predominantly found in the microorganisms isolated. furthermore, radicular cysts might be polymicrobial originated. although radicular cyst is an inflammatory cyst, some radicular cyst fluids might be sterile.

TI  == subgingival microbiota in adult down syndrome periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: the subgingival microbiota in down syndrome and non-down syndrome adults receiving periodic dental care was examined for 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization and the results were related to clinical periodontal attachment loss. material and methods: a total of 44 down syndrome, 66 non-down syndrome mentally retarded and 83 mentally normal adults were clinically evaluated. this involved, for each subject, the removal of subgingival specimens from three interproximal sites on different teeth; all subgingival samples per subject were then pooled and assessed for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial species using species-specific whole-genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significant group differences in species proportions averaged across subjects were evaluated using the kruskal-wallis test, and associations between subgingival species and mean subject attachment loss within down syndrome and non-down syndrome subject groups were quantified using pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analysis. results: down syndrome subjects exhibited greater attachment loss than  non-down syndrome subjects (p=0.05). most microbial species were present in down  syndrome subjects at levels similar to non-down syndrome subjects, except for higher proportions of selenomonas noxia, propionibacterium acnes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis in down syndrome subjects  compared with non-down syndrome study subjects, higher proportions of treponema socranskii in down syndrome subjects compared with non-down syndrome mentally retarded subjects, and higher proportions of streptococcus constellatus in down syndrome subjects compared with mentally normal subjects. down syndrome adults classified with periodontitis revealed higher subgingival levels of t. socranskii than down syndrome subjects with no periodontitis (p=0.02). higher subgingival proportions of s. constellatus, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, s. noxia  and prevotella nigrescens showed significant positive correlations (r=0.35-0.42)  and higher proportions of actinomyces naeslundii ii and actinomyces odontolyticus showed negative correlations (r=-0.36 to -0.40), with increasing mean subject attachment loss in down syndrome adults. conclusion: individuals with down syndrome show higher levels of some subgingival bacterial species and specific associations between certain subgingival bacterial species and loss of periodontal attachment. these findings are consistent with the notion that certain subgingival bacteria may contribute to the increased level of periodontal disease seen in down syndrome individuals and raise the question as to the reason for increased colonization in down syndrome.

TI  == molecular detection of in-vivo microbial contamination of metallic orthodontic brackets by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == introduction: knowing the microbiota that colonizes orthodontic appliances is important for planning strategies and implementing specific preventive measures during treatment. the purpose of this clinical trial was to evaluate in vivo the  contamination of metallic orthodontic brackets with 40 dna probes for different bacterial species by using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cddh) technique. methods: eighteen patients, 11 to 29 years of age having fixed orthodontic treatment, were enrolled in the study. each subject had 2 new metallic brackets bonded to different premolars in a randomized manner. after 30  days, the brackets were removed and processed for analysis by cddh. data on bacterial contamination were analyzed descriptively and with the kruskal-wallis and dunn post tests (alpha = 0.05). forty microbial species (cariogenic microorganisms, bacteria of the purple, yellow, green, orange complexes, "red complex +treponema socranskii," and the cluster of actinomyces) were assessed. results: most bacterial species were present in all subjects, except for streptococcus constellatus, campylobacter rectus, tannerella forsythia, t socranskii, and lactobacillus acidophillus (94.4%), propionibacterium acnes i and eubacterium nodatum (88.9%), and treponema denticola (77.8%). among the cariogenic microorganisms, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus were found in larger numbers than l acidophillus and lactobacillus casei (p <0.001). the periodontal pathogens of the orange complex were detected in larger numbers than those of the "red complex +t socranskii" (p <0.0001). among the bacteria not associated with specific pathologies, veillonella parvula (purple complex) was the most frequently detected strain (p <0.0001). the numbers of yellow and green  complex bacteria and the cluster of actinomyces were similar (p >0.05). conclusions: metallic brackets in use for 1 month were multi-colonized by several bacterial species, including cariogenic microorganisms and periodontal pathogens, reinforcing the need for meticulous oral hygiene and additional preventive measures to maintain oral health in orthodontic patients.

TI  == effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation between oral streptococci and actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == background: the co-aggregation of oral bacteria leads to their clearance from the oral cavity. poor oral hygiene and high saliva viscosity are common amongst the elderly; thus, they frequently suffer from pneumonia caused by the aspiration of  oral microorganisms. objectives: to examine the direct effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces. materials and methods: fifteen oral streptococcal and a single actinomyces strain were used. co-aggregation was assessed by a visual assay in phosphate buffer and a spectrophotometric assay in the same buffer containing 0-60% glycerol or whole saliva. results: nine oral streptococci co-aggregated with actinomyces naeslundii atcc12104 in the visual assay and were subsequently used for the spectrophotometric analysis. all tested strains displayed a decrease in co-aggregation with increasing amounts of glycerol in the buffer. the co-aggregation of streptococcus oralis with a. naeslundii recovered to baseline level following the removal of glycerol. the per cent co-aggregation of s. oralis with a. naeslundii was significantly correlated with the viscosity in unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva samples (correlation coefficients: -0.52 and -0.48, respectively). conclusion: this study suggests that saliva viscosity affects the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces and that bacterial co-aggregation decreases with increasing saliva viscosity.

TI  == campylobacter species isolated from extra-oro-intestinal abscesses: a report of four cases and literature review.
AB  == campylobacter species are frequently isolated from fecal specimens of patients with diarrheal illness. several campylobacter species are commonly isolated from  the oral cavity. in contrast, campylobacter species are rarely isolated from extra-oro-intestinal abscesses. reported here are four cases of extra-oro-intestinal abscesses due to polymicrobial flora, including campylobacter species. the first case is a 35-year-old woman who was diagnosed with a brain abscess caused by c. gracilis, streptococcus constellatus, and anaerobic gram-positive cocci. the second case is a 65-year-old man with a history of maxillary sinus carcinoma who developed a brain abscess due to polymicrobial flora, including c. concisus. the third case is a 24-year-old male  who was diagnosed with a vertebral abscess caused by c. rectus, eubacterium brachy, and actinomyces species. the fourth case is a 74-year-old woman who presented with an intraorbital abscess due to c. showae and micromonas (previously peptostreptococcus) micros. the first two patients died from a cause  directly related to their abscesses. all campylobacter species involved in the four cases were isolated anaerobically. the isolation of oral campylobacter species, e.g., c. rectus and c. showae, from abscesses suggests an oral source. a survey of the english literature was undertaken to identify reports of campylobacter species isolated from extra-oro-intestinal abscesses.

TI  == microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue after plaque accumulation: an experimental study in humans.
AB  == background: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect  of the absence of tongue hygiene on the microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue. methods: ten volunteers (aged 19 to 22 years) entered the study at baseline and were instructed to abstain from tongue cleaning for 7 days, followed by a period  of 3 days without any kind of oral hygiene. subsequently, a period of 21 days of  washout was employed, and this protocol was repeated three times. microbiological samples were obtained from the dorsum of the tongue at baseline and at the end of the period of coating accumulation and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: the species found in highest mean counts at baseline and day 10 were prevotella melaninogenica and veillonella parvula. the mean bacterial total counts enhanced significantly during the study (from 17.1x10(6) to 33.7x10(6)). proportions of red and blue complexes and levels of 18 species also increased after the period of coating accumulation, including several periodontal pathogens, such as prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus constellatus, tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and p. melaninogenica. conclusion: the tongue surface could be an important reservoir for periodontal pathogens and may play a  role in the recolonization of tooth surfaces and in the etiology of oral halitosis.

TI  == microarrays complement culture methods for identification of bacteria in endodontic infections.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the microbial composition of necrotic root canals using culture methods and microarray technology. twenty uniradicular  teeth with radiographic evidence of periapical bone loss and with no previous endodontic treatment were selected for this study. for molecular diagnosis a dna  chip with 20 different species-specific, 16s-rdna-directed catcher probes was used. the microorganisms most frequently detected by the dna chip were: micromonas micros, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp., tannerella forsythia, treponema  denticola, veillonella parvula, eubacterium nodatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces odontolyticus, and streptococcus constellatus. as expected, additional important bacterial taxa were found by culture analysis, but microorganisms such as t. forsythia and t. denticola could not be identified. in  conclusion, microarrays may provide significant additional information regarding  the endodontic microbiota by detecting bacterial species that are otherwise difficult or impossible to culture.

TI  == clinical and microbiological changes associated with the use of combined antimicrobial therapies to treat "refractory" periodontitis.
AB  == background: the present investigation examined clinical and microbial changes after a combined aggressive antimicrobial therapy in subjects identified as "refractory" to conventional periodontal therapy. method: fourteen subjects were  identified as "refractory" based on full-mouth mean attachment loss and/or >3 sites with attachment loss > or =3 mm following scaling and root planing (srp), periodontal surgery and systemic antibiotics. after baseline monitoring, subjects received srp, locally delivered tetracycline at pockets > or =4 mm, systemically  administered amoxicillin (500 mg, t.i.d. for 14 days)+metronidazole (250 mg, t.i.d. for 14 days) and professional removal of supragingival plaque weekly for 3 months. subjects were monitored clinically every 3 months post-therapy for 2 years. subgingival plaque samples were taken at the same time points from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. mean levels of each species were averaged within a subject at each visit. significance of changes in clinical and  microbiological parameters over time were evaluated using the friedman or wilcoxon signed ranks test. results: on average, subjects showed significant improvements in all clinical parameters after therapy. mean (+/-sem) full-mouth pocket depth reduction was 0.83+/-0.13 mm and mean attachment level "gain" was 0.44+/-0.12 at 24 months. clinical improvement was accompanied by major reductions in multiple subgingival species during the first 3 months of active therapy that were maintained for most species to the last monitoring visit. reductions occurred for three actinomyces species, "orange complex" species including campylobacter showae, eubacterium nodatum, three fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia as well as the "streptococcus milleri" group, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus intermedus. subjects differed in their response to therapy; six modest response subjects exhibited less attachment level gain and were characterized by reductions in the microbiota from baseline to 3 months, but re-growth of many species thereafter. conclusions: the combined antibacterial therapy was successful in controlling disease progression in 14 "refractory" periodontitis subjects for 2 years.

TI  == the acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  == the intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. in addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. the results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well  as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at ph 5.5 and 1% at ph 5.0, ph values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. at ph 5.0, members of the genus streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. the other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordinii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and sstreptococcus sanguis. analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.

TI  == distribution of selected bacterial species on intraoral surfaces.
AB  == background/aim: to examine the proportions of 40 bacterial species in samples from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces and saliva in systemically healthy adult subjects and to compare these microbiotas with those of supra- and subgingival plaque. methods: microbial samples were taken from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces of 225 systemically healthy subjects using a "buccal brush". saliva was taken by expectoration. forty-four of these subjects provided additional supra- and subgingival plaque samples. samples were individually evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage  of total dna probe count was determined for each species, at each sample location and averaged across subjects. the significance of differences among the proportions of the 40 test species at different sample locations was sought in the 225 and 44 subjects separately using the quade test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. cluster analysis was performed using the proportions of the 40 species at the different sample locations using the minimum similarity coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. the proportions of each species were averaged across subjects in the resulting cluster groups and the significance of differences was tested using the t-test and anova. results: microbial profiles differed markedly among sample locations in the 225 subjects,  with 34 of 40 species differing significantly. proportions of veillonella parvula and prevotella melaninogenica were higher in saliva and on the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the tongue, while streptococcus mitis and s. oralis were in significantly lower proportions in saliva and on the tongue dorsum. cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 2 clusters with >85% similarity. cluster 1  comprised saliva, lateral and dorsal tongue surfaces, while cluster 2 comprised the remaining soft tissue locations. v. parvula, p. melaninogenica, eikenella corrodens, neisseria mucosa, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium periodonticum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii and porphyromonas gingivalis were in significantly higher proportions in cluster 1 and s. mitis, s. oralis and s. noxia were significantly higher in cluster 2. these findings were confirmed using data from the 44 subjects providing plaque samples. the microbial profiles of supra- and subgingival plaque differed from the other sample locations, particularly in the increased proportions of the actinomyces species. species of  different genera exhibited different proportions on the various intraoral surfaces, but even within the genus streptococcus, there were differences in colonization patterns. s. oralis, s. mitis and s. constellatus colonized the soft tissues and saliva in higher proportions than the samples from the teeth, while the other 4 streptococcal species examined colonized the dental surfaces in proportions comparable to the soft tissue locations and saliva. conclusions: proportions of bacterial species differed markedly on different intraoral surfaces. the microbiota of saliva was most similar to that of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue. the microbiotas of the soft tissues resembled each other more than the microbiotas that colonized the teeth both above and below the gingival margin.

TI  == streptococci and actinomyces induce antibodies which cross react with epithelial  antigens in periodontitis.
AB  == perturbation of epithelial structure is a prominent but poorly understood feature of the immunopathological response to bacterial antigens which characterizes the  destructive lesion of periodontitis. western analysis of sera from 22 patients with periodontitis detected multiple antigens in extracts of epithelial cells whereas sera from 12 periodontally healthy subjects displayed only trace reaction with epithelial antigens. to investigate a possible relationship between the bacterial flora adjacent to diseased sites and the presence of antibodies reactive with epithelium, subgingival plaque samples were taken from deep periodontal pockets and cultured anaerobically. gram positive bacteria containing antigens cross-reactive with epithelial cells were reproducibly isolated by probing membrane colony-lifts with affinity-isolated (epithelium-specific) antibodies and identified by 16s rdna sequence homology as streptococci (s. mitis, s. constellatus and two s. intermedius strains) and actinomyces (a. georgiae, and a. sp. oral clone). conversely, when serum from patients with periodontitis was absorbed with the captured bacterial species the number of epithelial antigens recognized was specifically reduced. it was concluded that development of cross-reactive antibodies related to these organisms may contribute to perturbation of the epithelial attachment to the tooth and the progression of periodontitis. these autoreactive antibodies could also be a contributing factor in other diseases affecting epithelia.

TI  == actinomyces species, streptococci, and enterococcus faecalis in primary root canal infections.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of actinomyces species,  streptococci, and enterococcus faecalis in primary root canal infections by using a molecular genetic method. samples were obtained from 53 infected teeth, of which 27 cases were diagnosed as acute periradicular abscesses. dna was extracted to evaluate the occurrence of 13 bacterial species by using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. polymerase chain reaction using an ubiquitous bacterial primer was undertaken to check the presence of bacterial dna in clinical samples. all root canal samples contained bacteria as demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction. the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assay allowed the detection of streptococci in 22.6% of the samples, actinomyces species in 9.4%, and e. faecalis in 7.5%. the most prevalent species were members of the streptococcus anginosus group. with regard to the asymptomatic lesions, the most  prevalent species were s. intermedius (11.5% of the cases), e. faecalis (11.5%),  and s. anginosus (7.7%). s. constellatus was the most prevalent species in pus samples (25.9% of the cases). the other most prevalent species in abscessed teeth were a. gerencseriae (14.8%), s. gordonii (11.1%), s. intermedius (11.1%), a. israelii (7.4%), s. anginosus (7.4%), and s. sanguis (7.4%). s. constellatus was  the only species positively associated with acute periradicular abscess (p < 0.01).

TI  == molecular analysis of bacterial species associated with childhood caries.
AB  == although substantial epidemiologic evidence links streptococcus mutans to caries, the pathobiology of caries may involve more complex communities of bacterial species. molecular methods for bacterial identification and enumeration now make  it possible to more precisely study the microbiota associated with dental caries. the purpose of this study was to compare the bacteria found in early childhood caries (ecc) to those found in caries-free children by using molecular identification methods. cloning and sequencing of bacterial 16s ribosomal dnas from a healthy subject and a subject with ecc were used for identification of novel species or uncultivated phylotypes and species not previously associated with dental caries. ten novel phylotypes were identified. a number of species or  phylotypes that may play a role in health or disease were identified and warrant  further investigation. in addition, quantitative measurements for 23 previously known bacterial species or species groups were obtained by a reverse capture checkerboard assay for 30 subjects with caries and 30 healthy controls. significant differences were observed for nine species: s. sanguinis was associated with health and, in order of decreasing cell numbers, actinomyces gerencseriae, bifidobacterium, s. mutans, veillonella, s. salivarius, s. constellatus, s. parasanguinis, and lactobacillus fermentum were associated with  caries. these data suggest that a. gerencseriae and other actinomyces species may play an important role in caries initiation and that a novel bifidobacterium may  be a major pathogen in deep caries. further investigation could lead to the identification of targets for biological interventions in the caries process and  thereby contribute to improved prevention of and treatment for this significant public health problem.

TI  == efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (ii). effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == assessment of periradicular microbiota by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == in the present study the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. in group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. the gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. bacterial dna was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. the mean number (+/- sd) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in group 2 (p < 0.001). the majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from group 1 than from group 2. the differences were most notable for campylobacter gracilis, porphyromonas endodontalis, propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, streptococcus constellatus and actinomyces naeslundii i. bacterial species such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. also, p. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. the data supported the idea that  following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. the study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. the detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  == a diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. the samples were cultured  for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), streptococcus mitis (66-65%), prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), eikenella corrodens (51-52%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella loescheii, campylobacter gracilis, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter concisus, peptostreptococcus micros and selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. the bacterial species streptococcus constellatus, peptostreptococcus micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, e. corrodens and fusobacterium nucleatum  were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas streptococcus intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were associated with bleeding.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  == eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. the aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). the samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. forty-one different microbial species were isolated. gemella morbillorum and peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while p. micros, streptococcus intermedius, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loeschei, p. melaninogenica and selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. the bacterial species s. constellatus, g. morbillorum and p. magnus were  isolated in greater numbers in incisors and p. micros, s. intermedius, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides egertheii, b. forsythus, p. oralis and s. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. cluster i was predominated by s. constellatus, s. mitis, s. sanguis, g. morbillorum, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; cluster ii was predominated by s. sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea and p. intermedia; cluster iii was predominated by s. mitis, c. ochracea, f. nucleatum,  p. loeschei, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; and finally cluster iv was predominated by s. sanguis, c. gingivalis, veillonella parvula, campylobacter gracilis, f. nucleatum and p. intermedia. the bacterial species s. constellatus,  p. micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, eikenella corrodens and f. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while s. intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.

AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to determine the proportion and prevalence  of doxycycline resistant species in subgingival plaque samples taken during and after doxycycline administration. 20 subjects with adult periodontitis were randomly assigned to test (n = 10) or control groups (n = 10). saliva samples as  well as subgingival plaque samples taken from the distal surface of 6 posterior teeth were collected at baseline. all subjects received full mouth srp and the test group systemic doxycycline at the dosage of 100 mg/day for 14 days. saliva samples and plaque samples from the distal surface of 2 randomly selected teeth were taken at 3, 7 and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. control subjects were sampled at the same time points. samples were anaerobically dispersed and serially diluted in pras ringer's solution and plated on enriched trypticase soy blood agar plates with or without 4 microg/ml doxycycline. after 7 days of anaerobic incubation, colonies were counted on both sets of plates. microbial growth was washed from the doxycycline-containing media and the species identified using 40 dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. differences in proportions of resistant species between test and control groups were tested for significance at each time point using the mann whitney test and over time within each group using the quade test. the mean % (+/-sem) of isolates resistant to 4 microg/ml doxycycline in the plaque samples of the test subjects increased from 6+/-2 to 48+/-9% during doxycycline administration, decreasing to  25+/-6% 2 weeks later and 9+/-2% at 90 days. in saliva, the % of resistant isolates rose from 13+/-1% to 81+/-10% during doxycycline administration falling  to 46+/-8% 2 weeks later and 22+/-5% at 90 days. the % of resistant isolates did  not change significantly in plaque or saliva samples of the control subjects at the same time points. for all subject visits combined, the most prevalent resistant species were: streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula, actinomyces gerencseriae, streptococcus constellatus, actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, streptococcus gordonii, eikenella corrodens and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1. doxycycline resistant strains of these  species were detected in both plaque and saliva samples prior to therapy and in the control group. despite the finding of increased resistance, approximately 50% of the organisms present at periodontal sites at the end of 14 days of doxycycline administration tested sensitive to the agent.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == clinical and microbiological features of refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the clinical parameters and the  site prevalence and levels of 40 subgingival species in successfully treated and  refractory periodontitis subjects. 94 subjects received scaling and root planing  and if needed, periodontal surgery and systemically administered tetracycline. 28 refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or > 3 sites showing attachment loss > 2.5 mm within 1 year post-therapy. 66 successfully treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss > 2.5 mm. baseline subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the mean levels and % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject and differences between groups sought using the mann-whitney test. most of the 40 species tested, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus, were equally or less prevalent in the refractory group. prevotella nigrescens was significantly more prevalent in successfully treated subjects, while refractory subjects harbored a larger proportion of streptococcus species, particularly streptococcus constellatus. the odds of a subject being refractory was 8.6 (p < 0.001) if s. constellatus constituted > or = 3.5% of the  total dna probe count. since few microbiological differences existed between treatment outcome groups using dna probes to known species, the predominant cultivable microbiota of 33 subgingival samples from 14 refractory subjects was examined. 85% of the 1649 isolates were identified using probes to 69 recognized  subgingival species. the remaining unidentified strains were classified by analyzing 16s rrna gene sequences. many sequenced isolates were of taxa not considered a common part of the oral microbiota such as acinetobacter baumanni, gemella haemolysans, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus warneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa and novel species in the genera bartonella, ralstonia, neisseria, eubacterium, rothia, gordona, gemella, corynebacterium, leptotrichia, and actinomyces. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their subgingival microbiota. as a group, they did not harbor more of the "classic" periodontopathogens, although elevated proportions of s. constellatus were found.

TI  == interaction of the salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with the bacterium streptococcus salivarius hb.
AB  == the interaction of the human salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with a number of oral bacterial species, following incubation with human whole saliva, has been investigated. ep-gp could be detected with a specific monoclonal antibody, by means of elisa or by electrophoresis in combination with western transfer. the results indicated that ep-gp is bound only by streptococcus salivarius, and not by the other tested strains of bacteria, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides fragilis, s. gordonii, s. oralis, s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. rattus, s. constellatus, and s. anginosus. binding of ep-gp to s. salivarius is mediated by a protein-protein interaction, which was found to be ph-dependent with a maximum binding between ph 5 and 6. for further characterization of the binding of ep-gp  to s. salivarius, four mutants were tested, each of them lacking different cell wall antigens. ep-gp was bound to all mutants in amounts comparable with the wildtype, in spite of the different surface antigen compositions. we were able to identify a 27-kd ep-gp binding protein, by extraction of s. salivarius-cell wall  antigens and electrophoretic techniques. in addition to ep-gp, s. salivarius also bound two other salivary proteins, namely, secretory iga and low-molecular-weight mucin (mg-2).

TI  == recent taxonomic changes for anaerobic gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms.
AB  == the strains formerly classified as streptococcus anginosus or "streptococcus milleri" have now been recognized as three distinct species, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, and streptococcus intermedius. streptococcus morbillorum has been transferred into the genus gemella. four new species within the genus peptostreptococcus were recently named. a recent addition to the genus clostridium is clostridium argentinense, which includes clostridium botulinum type g. two new species of actinomyces have been introduced: actinomyces georgiae and actinomyces gerencseriae. arachnia propionica was shown to be related to propionibacteria and has been renamed propionibacterium propionicum. eubacterium yurii was named to contain "test-tube  brush" bacteria found in subgingival plaque. lactobacillus uli and lactobacillus  rimae are obligately anaerobic lactobacilli found in periodontal pockets. bilophila is a new genus of gram-negative bacilli. wolinella recta and wolinella  curva are now included in the genus campylobacter. the taxonomic position of mobiluncus, currently assigned to the family bacteroidaceae, remains uncertain.

TI  == characterization of hemolytic bacteria in subgingival plaque.
AB  == three-quarters of the patients with periodontal diseases surveyed in this study had one or more distinct types of hemolytic bacteria in their subgingival plaque. twelve different species of bacteria were identified, belonging to five genera (actinomyces, streptococcus, staphylococcus, prevotella, and actinobacillus). nine hemolytic isolates, consisting of four prevotella denticola strains, two actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 strains, and one each of p. melaninogenica,  streptococcus constellatus, and a. naeslundii genospecies 1 strains were characterized. incorporation of pronase into blood agar medium inhibited hemolysis by all of the isolates, suggesting a proteinaceous component for each of their hemolysins. with one exception, hemolysin production appeared to be regulated by the concentration of environmental iron: exogenous hemin was found to inhibit hemolysin production, and the iron scavenging compound, 2,2'- dipyridyl, was found to promote hemolysin production by all of the strains except for the s. constellatus isolate. genomic libraries of each of the hemolytic plaque isolates were prepared in escherichia coli using pbr322. hemolytic clones  were isolated on blood agar medium containing ampicillin at frequencies ranging from 1-6.7 x 10(-4). extensive restriction mapping revealed regions of homology in the case of clones derived from three p. denticola strains isolated from the same subjects. two of the p. denticola-derived clones were virtually identical throughout the entrety of their > 5 kb inserts. the clone derived from the third  strain showed good homology to the other two within a 1.3 kb region, but the flanking dna showed no homology even though all three p. denticola isolates were  shown to be clonally related by ribotyping.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == prevalence of viridans streptococci exhibiting lactose-inhibitable coaggregation  with oral actinomycetes.
AB  == fresh oral isolates from human dental plaque were selected on the basis of their  spherical morphology. in a double-blind experiment, their species identity and ability to coaggregate with human oral actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii were determined. of the 110 isolates characterized, 30 were identified as either streptococcus mutans, streptococcus anginosus-constellatus, or veillonella parvula; none of these coaggregated with the actinomycetes. the remaining 80 isolates were identified as streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mg-intermedius, or streptococcus morbillorum. of these 49 isolates (61%) coaggregated with actinomycetes, and nearly 90% (43 of 49 isolates) exhibited lactose-inhibitable coaggregations. compared with previously  characterized coaggregation properties determined with stock culture strains of streptococci, 82% of the fresh isolates exhibited identical coaggregations. the other 18% made up a new coaggregation group that possessed a related lactose-inhibitable coaggregation pattern. thus, most fresh isolates that coaggregated exhibited lactose-inhibitable coaggregations with human oral actinomycetes. it is suggested that these coaggregations are mediated by a network of lectin-carbohydrate interactions similar to those already characterized in previous studies with stock cultures of actinomycetes and streptococci.
