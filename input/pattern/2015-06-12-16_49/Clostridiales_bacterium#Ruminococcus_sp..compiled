TI  - Effects of Lactobacillus salivarius Ren on cancer prevention and intestinal microbiota in 1, 2-dimethylhydrazine-induced rat model.
AB  - Probiotics have been suggested as a prophylactic measure in colon cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of Lactobacillus salivarius Ren (Ren) in modulating colonic microbiota structure and colon cancer incidence in a rat model after injection with 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine (DMH). The results indicated that oral administration of Ren could effectively suppress DMH-induced colonic carcinogenesis. A significant decrease in cancer incidence (87.5% to 25%) was detected in rats fed with a dose of 5 x 1010 CFU/kg bodyweight per day. Using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and Real-time PCR combined with multivariate statistical methods, we demonstrated that injection with DMH significantly altered the rat gut microbiota, while Ren counteracted these DMH-induced adverse effects and promoted reversion of the gut microbiota close to the healthy state. Tvalue biplots followed by band sequencing identified 21 bacterial strains as critical variables affected by DMH and Ren. Injection of DMH significantly increased the amount of Ruminococcus species (sp.) and Clostridiales bacteria, as well as decreasing the Prevotella sp. Administration of Ren reduced the amount of Ruminococcus sp., Clostridiales bacteria, and Bacteroides dorei, and increased the amount of Prevotella. Real-time PCR results were consistent with the results derived by t-value biplots. These findings suggested that Ren is a potential agent for colon cancer prevention. In conclusion, the results in the present study suggest a potential therapeutic approach based on the modulation of intestinal microflora by probiotics may be beneficial in the prevention of colorectal carcinogenesis.
TI  - Dominant bacterial communities in the rumen of Gayals (Bos frontalis), Yaks (Bos  grunniens) and Yunnan Yellow Cattle (Bos taurs) revealed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  - The dominant rumen bacteria in Gayals, Yaks and Yunnan Yellow Cattle were investigated using PCR-DGGE approach. The analysis of DGGE profiles, identification of dominant bands and phylogenetic analysis 16S rDNA sequences in DGGE profiles were combined to reveal the dominant bacterial communities and compared the differences between those cattle species. DGGE profiles revealed that Gayals had the most abundant dominant bacteria and the lowest similarity of intraspecies between individuals than other two cattle species. A total of 45 sequences were examined and sequence similarity analysis revealed that Gayals had the most sequences appeared to uncultured bacteria, accounting for 85.0% of the total sequences, Yaks and Yunnan Yellow Cattle had 44.4 and 68.8% uncultured bacterial sequences, respectively. According to phylogenetic analysis, the rumen dominant bacteria of Gayals were mainly phylogenetically placed within phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes, and the known bacteria were mainly belonged to the genera Lachnospiraceae bacterium, Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Clostridium celerecrescens. Moreover, the dominant bacteria of Yaks were also mainly belonged to phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes, and the known dominant bacteria were including Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, Schwartzia succinivorans and Clostridiales bacterium, most of them are common rumen bacteria. In addition, the dominant bacteria in Yunnan Yellow Cattle were belonged to phyla firmicutes, bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria, and the known dominant bacteria containing Prevotella sp., Staphylococci lentus, Staphylococcus xylosus and Corynebacterium casei. Present study first detected Staphylococcus lentus and Staphylococcus xylosus in the rumen of cattle.
