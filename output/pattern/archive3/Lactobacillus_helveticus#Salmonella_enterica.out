in vitro antibacterial activity of lactobacillus helveticus strain ks300 against  diarrhoeagenic, uropathogenic and vaginosis-associated bacteria.
aims: the purpose of this study was to investigate in vitro the antibacterial activity of the lactobacillus helveticus strain ks300 against vaginosis-associated bacteria including gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella bivia, uropathogenic escherichia coli, and diarrhoeagenic salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. methods and results: the ks300 strain inhibited the growth of g. vaginalis, p. bivia, s. typhimurium, and pathogenic e. coli. after direct co-culture, data show that the lactobacillus strain decreased the viability of g. vaginalis, p. bivia, s. typhimurium, and pathogenic e. coli. the adhering ks300 strain inhibited the adhesion of g. vaginalis dsm 4944 and uropathogenic dr-positive e. coli ih11128 onto hela cells. moreover, the ks300 strain inhibited the internalization of uropathogenic dr-positive e. coli ih11128 within hela cells and s. typhimurium sl1344 within caco-2/tc7 cells. conclusions: the findings demonstrate that l. helveticus strain ks300 is adhesive onto cultured human cells and has antagonistic activities against vaginosis-associated, uropathogenic and diarrhoeagenic pathogens. significance and impact of the study: adhering l. helveticus strain ks300 is a potential probiotic strain displaying a strain-specific array of in vitro antibacterial activities.
antibacterial activity of lactobacillus species against vibrio species.
forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.
inhibition of clostridium tyrobutyricum by bacteriocin-like substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.
lactic acid bacteria were selected for their inhibitory activity against clostridium tyrobutyricum under conditions that eliminate the effects of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide. four strains were isolated belonging to the species lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. the sensitivity of the inhibitory substances to pronase and trypsine indicates that they are proteins or peptides different from nisin. their resistance to phospholipase d indicates that they are also different from lactostrepcin. the inhibitory substances are produced during the exponential phase of growth. their activity is bactericidal and directed toward some strains of clostridium tyrobutyricum, lactobacillus helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus, but strains used as dairy starters, lactobacillus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, and propionibacterium shermanii, are not all affected by the inhibition.
