TI  == antibiotic-resistant bacteria: prevalence in food and inactivation by food-compatible compounds and plant extracts.
AB  == foodborne antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria such as campylobacter jejuni,  bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica,  staphylococcus aureus, vibrio cholerae, and vibrio parahemolyticus can adversely  affect animal and human health, but a better understanding of the factors involved in their pathogenesis is needed. to help meet this need, this overview surveys and interprets much of our current knowledge of antibiotic (multidrug)-resistant bacteria in the food chain and the implications for microbial food safety and animal and human health. topics covered include the origin and prevalence of resistant bacteria in the food chain (dairy, meat, poultry, seafood, and herbal products, produce, and eggs), their inactivation by  different classes of compounds and plant extracts and by the use of chlorine and  physicochemical methods (heat, uv light, pulsed electric fields, and high pressure), the synergistic antimicrobial effects of combinations of natural antimicrobials with medicinal antibiotics, and mechanisms of antimicrobial activities and resistant effects. possible areas for future research are suggested. plant-derived and other safe natural antimicrobial compounds have the  potential to control the prevalence of both susceptible and resistant pathogens in various environments. the collated information and suggested research will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of approaches that could be used to minimize the presence of resistant pathogens in animal feed and human food, thus reducing adverse effects, improving microbial food safety, and helping to prevent or treat animal and human infections.

TI  == survival of salmonella spp. and fecal indicator bacteria in vietnamese biogas digesters receiving pig slurry.
AB  == small-scale biogas digesters are widely promoted worldwide as a sustainable technology to manage livestock manure. in vietnam, pig slurry is commonly applied to biogas digesters for production of gas for electricity and cooking with the effluent being used to fertilize field crops, vegetables and fish ponds. slurry may contain a variety of zoonotic pathogens, e.g. salmonella spp., which are able to cause disease in humans either through direct contact with slurry or by fecal  contamination of water and foods. the objective of this study was to evaluate the survival of salmonella spp. and the fecal indicator bacteria, enterococci, e. coli, and spores of clostridium perfringens in biogas digesters operated by small-scale vietnamese pig farmers. the serovar and antimicrobial susceptibility  of the salmonella spp. isolated were also established. the study was conducted in 12 farms (6 farms with and 6 farms without toilet connected) located in hanam province, vietnam. sampling of pig slurry and biogas effluent was done during two seasons. results showed that the concentration of enterococci, e. coli, and clostridium perfringens spores was overall reduced by only 1-2 log10-units in the biogas digesters when comparing raw slurry and biogas effluent. salmonella spp. was found in both raw slurry and biogas effluent. a total of 19 salmonella serovars were identified, with the main serovars being salmonella typhimurium (55/138), salmonella enterica serovar 4,[5],12:i:- (19/138), salmonella weltevreden (9/138) and salmonella rissen (9/138). the salmonella serovars showed similar antimicrobial resistance patterns to those previously reported from vietnam. when promoting biogas, farmers should be made aware that effluent should only be used as fertilizer for crops not consumed raw and that indiscriminate discharge of effluent are likely to contaminate water recipients, e.g. drinking water sources, with pathogens. relevant authorities should promote safe animal manure management practices to farmers and regulations be updated to ensure food  safety and public health.

TI  == pathogen exclusion properties of canine probiotics are influenced by the growth media and physical treatments simulating industrial processes.
AB  == aims: manufacturing process used in preparation of probiotic products may alter beneficial properties of probiotics. the effect of different growth media and inactivation methods on the protective properties of canine-originated probiotic  bacteria against adhesion of canine enteropathogens was investigated. methods and results: three established dog probiotics, lactobacillus fermentum vet9a, lactobacillus plantarum vet14a and lactobacillus rhamnosus vet16a, and their mixture were assessed using the dog mucus pathogen exclusion model. the pathogens used were enterococcus canis, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and clostridium perfringens. the effect of growth media, one reflecting laboratory and the other manufacture conditions, and viability (viable and heat inactivated, 80 degrees c per 30 min) on the pathogen exclusion properties of probiotics were  characterized. greater pathogen exclusion percentages were noted for probiotics growing in conditions reflecting manufacture when compared to laboratory (p < 0.05). inactivation of probiotics by heat (80 degrees c per 30 min) increased pathogen exclusion compared with their viable forms (p < 0.05). conclusions: manufacturing process conditions such as growth media, incubation temperature and pretreatment methods may significantly affect the protective properties of the tested strains. significance and impact of the study: growing conditions and pretreatment methods should be carefully considered when designing new probiotics to reduce the risk of common infections in dogs. the studied probiotics are promising potential feed additives for dogs.

TI  == disease-outcome trees, eq-5d scores, and estimated annual losses of quality-adjusted life years (qalys) for 14 foodborne pathogens in the united states.
AB  == measures of disease burden such as quality-adjusted life years (qalys) are increasingly important to risk-based food safety policy. they provide a means of  comparing relative risk from diverse health outcomes. we present detailed disease-outcome trees and eq-5d scoring for 14 major foodborne pathogens representing over 95% of foodborne illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths due to specified agents in the united states (campylobacter spp., clostridium perfringens, cryptosporidium parvum, cyclospora cayetanensis, escherichia coli o157:h7, shiga toxin-producing e. coli non-o157, listeria monocytogenes, nontyphoidal salmonella enterica, shigella, toxoplasma gondii, vibrio vulnificus, vibrio parahaemolyticus and other noncholera vibrio, and yersinia enterocolitica). we estimate over 5800 qalys lost per 1000 cases of l. monocytogenes and v. vulnificus, compared to 125 qalys lost per 1000 cases of t.  gondii, 26 for e. coli o157:h7, 16 for salmonella and campylobacter, and 14 for y. enterocolitica. the remaining 7 pathogens are estimated to cause less than 5 qalys lost per 1000 cases. in total, these 14 pathogens cause over 61,000 in qaly loss annually, with more than 90% due solely to acute infection being responsible for 65% of total qaly loss, with premature mortality and morbidity due to chronic and congenital illness responsible for another 28%. these estimates of the burden of chronic sequelae are likely conservative; additional epidemiological research  is needed to support more accurate burden estimates. this study shows the value of using integrated metrics for comparing disease burden, and the need to consider chronic and congenital illness when prioritizing foodborne pathogens.

TI  == enteropathogen co-infection in uk cats with diarrhoea.
AB  == background: individual enteropathogen infections in healthy and clinically ill cats are well described, but prevalence and patterns of enteropathogen co-infection have only been reported on a limited basis. we studied enteropathogen co-infection in diarrhoeic uk cats using results of a real time pcr assay for 8 enteropathogenic species; feline coronavirus (co), feline panleukopenia virus (pa), clostridium perfringens (cl), salmonella enterica (sa), giardia spp. (gi), tritrichomonas foetus (tr), cryptosporidium spp. (cr), and toxoplasma gondii (to). age, gender, breed and history were recorded. pcr panels  from 1088 diarrhoeic cats were available for analysis. results: overall enteropathogen prevalence was 56.9% (co), 22.1% (pa), 56.6% (cl), 0.8% (sa), 20.6% (gi), 18.8% (tr), 24.4% (cr) and 1.0% (to). prevalence of co, gi and tr was higher in pedigree cats compared to non-pedigree cats (dsh) and prevalence decreased with increasing age for co, pa, gi, cr and tr. co-infection was common: >/=2 enteropathogens were detected in 62.5% of cats, and 13.3% of cats had >/=4 enteropathogens. mean ( x ) enteropathogen co-infection 2.01 (+/-1.3 sd), was significantly higher in pedigree cats ( x =2.51) compared to dsh ( x =1.68) and decreased with age ( x =2.64 <6 months, x =1.68 for >1 yr). more cats were negative for all 8 enteropathogens tested (12.7%) than expected. when exact combinations of co-infection were examined, tr tended to be found in combinations with co, cl, and gi. conclusions: multiple infections should be considered the most likely result of faecal testing in cats, and case management needs to take this into account. in contrast, the relatively high percentage of cats negative for all 8 enteropathogens tested could indicate an innate resistance to infection. alternatively it could indicate a lack of exposure to these 8 enteropathogens or the presence of other enteropathogens not assessed by this assay.

TI  == growth-inhibiting and morphostructural effects of constituents identified in asarum heterotropoides root on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == background: the growth-inhibiting and morphostructural effects of seven constituents identified in asarum heterotropoides root on 14 intestinal bacteria  were compared with those of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin. method: a microtiter plate-based bioassay in sterile 96-well plates was used to evaluate  the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the test materials against the organisms. results: delta-3-carene (5) exhibited the most potent growth inhibition of gram-positive bacteria (clostridium difficile atcc 9689, clostridium paraputrificum atcc 25780, clostridium perfringens atcc 13124, and staphylococcus aureus atcc 12600) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli atcc 11775 and bacteroides fragilis atcc 25285) (minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic), 0.18-0.70 mg/ml) except for salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 13311 (mic, 2.94 mg/ml). the mic of methyleugenol (2), 1,8-cineole (3), alpha-asarone (4), (-)-asarinin (6), and pellitorine (7) was between 1.47 and 2.94 mg/ml against all test bacteria (except for compound 2 against c. difficile (0.70 mg/ml); compounds 1 (23.50 mg/ml) and 4 (5.80 mg/ml) against c. paraputricum; compounds 2 (5.80 mg/ml), 4 (12.0 mg/ml), and 7 (0.70 mg/ml) against c. perfringens); compound 1 against e. coli (7.20 mg/ml) and s. enterica serovar typhimurium (12.0 mg/ml). overall, all of the constituents were  less potent at inhibiting microbial growth than ciprofloxacin (mic, 0.063-0.25 mg/ ml). the lactic acid-producing bacteria (four bifidobacteria and two lactobacilli) and one acidulating bacterium clostridium butyricum atcc 25779 were less sensitive and more susceptible than the five harmful bacteria and two nonpathogenic bacteria (b. fragilis and e. coli) to the constituents and to ciprofloxacin, respectively. beneficial gram-positive bacteria and harmful and nonpathogenic gram-negative bacteria were observed to have different degrees of antimicrobial susceptibility to the constituents, although the antimicrobial susceptibility of the harmful gram-positive bacteria and the harmful and nonpathogenic gram-negative bacteria was not observed. scanning electron microscopy observations showed different degrees of physical damage and morphological alteration to both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria treated with alpha-asarone, delta-3-carene, pellitorine, or ciprofloxacin, indicating that they do not share a common mode of action. conclusion: a. heterotropoides root-derived materials described merit further study as potential antibacterial products or lead molecules for the prevention or eradication from humans from diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.

TI  == infectious pancreatic necrosis virus in fish by-products is inactivated with inorganic acid (ph 1) and base (ph 12).
AB  == the aquaculture industry needs a simple, inexpensive and safe method for the treatment of fish waste without heat. microbial inactivation by inorganic acid (hcl) or base (koh) was determined using infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (ipnv) as a model organism for fish pathogens. salmonella and spores of clostridium perfringens were general hygiene indicators in supplementary examinations. ipnv, which is considered to be among the most chemical- and heat-resistant fish pathogens, was reduced by more than 3 log in 4 h at ph 1.0 and ph 12.0. salmonella was rapidly inactivated by the same treatment, whereas spores of c. perfringens were hardly affected. the results indicate that low and  high ph treatment could be particularly suitable for fish waste destined for biogas production. ph treatment at aquaculture production sites could reduce the  spread of fish pathogens during storage and transportation without disturbing the anaerobic digestion process. the treatment could also be an alternative to the current energy-intensive steam pressure sterilization of fish waste to be used by the bioenergy, fertilizer and soil improver industries.

TI  == development and application of a multiplex pcr assay for rapid detection of 4 major bacterial pathogens in ducks.
AB  == infections with pasteurella multocida, salmonella enterica, riemerella anatipestifer, and escherichia coli result in high morbidity and mortality, which cause significant economic loss in the poultry industry. it can be difficult to distinguish these pathogens based on clinical signs because these pathogens can cause similar clinical signs and coinfections can occur. thus, rapid and sensitive detection of these 4 major bacterial pathogens are important in ducks.  the aim of this study was to develop a multiplex pcr (mpcr) assay for simultaneously detecting and identifying these 4 pathogenic bacteria in a single  tube reaction. the target genes used were kmt1 of p. multocida, the invasion protein gene of s. enterica, 16s rdna of r. anatipestifer, and the alkaline phosphatase gene of e. coli. the detection limit of the assay for all bacterial dna was 10 pg. the mpcr did not produce any nonspecific amplification products when tested against other related pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, clostridium perfringens, mycoplasma gallinarum, mycoplasma synoviae, and mycoplasma gallisepticum, which can also infect ducks. we applied mpcr to field samples, and the results were the same as the single pcr results. these results suggest that mpcr for the 4 bacteria is a useful and rapid technique to apply to field samples.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of essential oils from mediterranean aromatic plants against several foodborne and spoilage bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from a variety of aromatic plants, often used in the portuguese gastronomy was studied in vitro by the agar  diffusion method. the essential oils of thyme, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil, peppermint, pennyroyal and mint were tested against gram-positive (listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus epidermidis) and  gram-negative strains (salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for most essential oils examined, s. aureus, was the most susceptible bacteria, while p. aeruginosa showed, in general, least susceptibility. among the eight essential oils evaluated, thyme, oregano and pennyroyal oils showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, followed by rosemary, peppermint and verbena, while basil and mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity. most of the essential oils considered in this study exhibited a significant inhibitory effect. thyme oil showed a promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, thus revealing its potential as a natural preservative in food products against several causal agents of foodborne diseases and food spoilage. in general, the results demonstrate that, besides flavoring the food, the use of aromatic herbs in gastronomy can also contribute to a bacteriostatic effect against pathogens.

TI  == macrocyclic mechanism-based inhibitor for neuraminidases.
AB  == a macrocyclic mechanism-based inhibitor for neuraminidases (nas) bearing a 2-difluoromethylphenyl aglycone and a linker between the aglycone and c-9 positions of sialic acid was synthesized and evaluated. the macrocyclic structure was designed to keep the aglycone moiety in the active site of the neuraminidase  after cleavage of the glycoside bond. when vibrio chorelae neuraminidase (vcna) was treated with a similar acyclic derivative in the presence of detergent, the irreversible inhibition property was disabled. in contrast, this macrocyclic compound acted as an irreversible inhibitor for vcna in the presence of detergent. inhibition assay for various nas using this macrocyclic compound revealed that the irreversible inhibition property depends on the k(cat) of the neuraminidase treated. nas having small k(cat) values, such as influenza viruses, clostridium, trypanosoma cruzi, and human, were also inhibited irreversibly. however, salmonella typhimurium na, which has an extremely high k(cat) , was not  affected irreversibly by the inhibitor. interestingly, in contrast to common k(cat) inhibitors, the irreversibility of inhibition by this macrocyclic compound is inversely proportional to the k(cat) of the target neuraminidase.

TI  == ranking the disease burden of 14 pathogens in food sources in the united states using attribution data from outbreak investigations and expert elicitation.
AB  == understanding the relative public health impact of major microbiological hazards  across the food supply is critical for a risk-based national food safety system.  this study was conducted to estimate the u.s. health burden of 14 major pathogens in 12 broad categories of food and to then rank the resulting 168 pathogen-food combinations. these pathogens examined were campylobacter, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, norovirus, salmonella enterica, toxoplasma gondii, and all other foodnet pathogens. the health burden associated with each pathogen was measured using new estimates of the cost of illness and loss of quality-adjusted life years (qalys) from acute and chronic illness and mortality. a new method for attributing illness to foods  was developed that relies on both outbreak data and expert elicitation. this method assumes that empirical data are generally preferable to expert judgment; thus, outbreak data were used for attribution except where evidence suggests that these data are considered not representative of food attribution. based on evaluation of outbreak data, expert elicitation, and published scientific literature, outbreak-based attribution estimates for campylobacter, toxoplasma, cryptosporidium, and yersinia were determined not representative; therefore, expert-based attribution were included for these four pathogens. sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the effect of attribution data assumptions on rankings. disease burden was concentrated among a relatively small number of pathogen-food combinations. the top 10 pairs were responsible for losses of over  $8 billion and 36,000 qalys, or more than 50 % of the total across all pairs. across all 14 pathogens, poultry, pork, produce, and complex foods were responsible for nearly 60 % of the total cost of illness and loss of qalys.

TI  == several enteropathogens are circulating in suckling and newly weaned piglets suffering from diarrhea in the province of villa clara, cuba.
AB  == intestinal contents of suckling (n = 45) and newly weaned (n = 45) piglets, suffering from diarrhea in the province of villa clara in cuba, were tested for viral, bacterial, and parasitic enteropathogens from may to june 2008. at least one enteropathogen was identified in 53.3 % of piglets and enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec; 25.6 %) was the major pathogen; mostly sta(+)/stb(+) or f4(+)/sta(+)/stb(+) etec were isolated. the overall occurrence of the rest of pathogens was 10 % for transmissible gastroenteritis virus (tgev) and cryptosporidium parvum, 6.7 % for rotavirus a and isospora suis, 5.6 % for alpha-toxigenic clostridium perfringens, 3.3 % for verotoxigenic e. coli (vtec),  and 2.2 % for salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar newport. tgev and alpha-toxigenic c. perfringens were only identified in suckling piglets, while salmonella newport and vtec were only detected in weaned pigs. porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (pedv), beta-toxigenic c. perfringens, eimeria spp., and helminths were not identified. eight kinds of mixed infections were detected in 25 % of enteropathogen positive piglets. etec was present in 10 of 12 mixed infections, and tgev infections were never combined. this survey demonstrates that several enteropathogens are circulating in piggeries located in the province of villa clara in cuba, and that is necessary to improve surveillance, prevention, and control of enteric infections in order to increase production efficiency.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of butyrate glycerides toward salmonella typhimurium and clostridium perfringens.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities of n-butyric acid and its derivatives against salmonella typhimurium and clostridium perfringens were studied. n-butyric acid and its derivatives (monobutyrin and a mixture of mono-, di-, and tri-glycerides  of butyric acid) were added at different concentrations (ranging from 250 to 7,000 mg/kg to a media inoculated with either salmonella typhimurium or c. perfringens. the antimicrobial activity of butyric acid against c. perfringens was measured at 2 bacterium concentrations and 2 inoculations involving ambient aerobic or anaerobic conditions. the most effective antimicrobial activity for salmonella typhimurium was observed with n-butyric acid, with 90% inhibition rate at a concentration of 1,500 mg/kg. although minimal inhibition for salmonella typhimurium was observed with butyric acid glycerides, lipase addition to a mixture of mono-, di-, and triglycerides of butyric acid increased (p < 0.01) antimicrobial activity of these derivatives. antimicrobial activity of butyric acid and its derivative against c. perfringens was higher when using a moderate initial inoculation concentration (10(5)) compared with a higher initial concentration (10(7)) of this bacterium. at a lower inoculation of c. perfringens (10(5)), >90% inhibition rate by all butyric acid glycerides was observed with prior aerobic inoculation at 2,000 mg/kg, whereas using anaerobic inoculation, only 50% monobutyrin maintained >90% inhibitory effect at 3,000 mg/kg. the antimicrobial effect of monobutyrin against c. perfringens was generally higher (p < 0.01) for 50% monobutyrin than for 100% monobutyrin. either a mixture of butyric acid derivatives or 50% monobutyrin decreased (p < 0.01) c. perfringens in a media containing intestinal contents whereas only 50% monobutyrin decreased  (p < 0.01) salmonella typhimurium within a media containing cecal contents from mature leghorns. these results show that n-butyric acid and 50% monobutyrin could be used to control salmonella typhimurium or c. perfringens in poultry species.

TI  == the role of an early salmonella typhimurium infection as a predisposing factor for necrotic enteritis in a laboratory challenge model.
AB  == necrotic enteritis (ne) caused by clostridium perfringens (cp) in poultry is an important bacterial disease in terms of economic implications. the disease is multifactorial and is invariably associated with predisposing factors. in the present experiments, we investigated the potential predisposing role of neonatal  salmonella typhimurium (st) infection for ne-associated mortality in a laboratory challenge model. in two experiments, day-of-hatch chicks were randomly assigned to four groups: group 1, nonchallenged control; group 2, chickens received eimeria maxima (em) and cp; group 3, chickens received em and cp and were also challenged with st at day 1 of age; group 4, chickens received em and cp and were also challenged with st at day 17 of age. challenged groups received an oral dose of em at 18 days of age and cp (10(8) colony-forming units/chick) at 22-23 days of age. when compared to em and cp, chicks challenged with st (day 1) had increased ne-associated mortality and cp-associated lesion scores (p < 0.05) in both experiments. furthermore, body weight and body weight gain were lower (p < 0.05) in chicks infected with st (day 1) in the first experiment, even though no  differences (p > 0.05) were observed in weight gain in the second experiment. chicks challenged with st (day 17) were similar to the em and cp group in all of  the above-mentioned parameters, indicating that a paratyphoid infection in younger chicks remarkably alters the susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections. based on this work, the authors suggest that an st infection early in the age of a chick may be important for altering susceptibility to ne, an observation that may be useful from the perspective of experimental reproduction  of this disease and, perhaps, as an economically important reason to address the  problem of paratyphoid salmonella infections in young chicks.

TI  == assessment of 2 salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium-based vaccines against necrotic enteritis in reducing colonization of chickens by salmonella serovars of different serogroups.
AB  == this study assessed the protective efficacy of oral vaccination with 2 experimental attenuated salmonella typhimurium-vectored vaccines for necrotic enteritis in protecting chickens against intestinal colonization by common serovars of salmonella belonging to the 4 major serogroups affecting chickens. birds were vaccinated orally with 1 x 10(8) colony-forming units (cfu) of 1 of the vaccine strains chi9241 and chi9352, which express a plasmid-encoded partial  recombinant hypothetical protein gene (thp) of clostridium perfringens, at days 1 and 7 of age, and then were challenged at 14 d of age with 10(6) cfu of salmonella serovars anatum, enteritidis, heidelberg, kentucky, or typhimurium (representative serovars of serogroups b, c, d, and e). birds were necropsied at  4 wk of age, and samples were collected to determine reduction in tissue and intestinal colonization. the chickens vaccinated with chi9241-thp showed reduced  colonization by salmonella enteritidis (serogroup d) and by salmonella heidelberg and salmonella typhimurium (serogroup b) compared with the control birds. no reduction in colonization was observed in the chickens vaccinated with chi9352-thp. there was an association between the efficacy of these vaccine strains in protecting against necrotic enteritis, assessed on an earlier occasion, and their efficacy in protecting against salmonella colonization. thus, the choice of an attenuated salmonella typhimurium vaccine vector for delivery of heterologous antigens to chickens should be based partly on the vaccine's value in protecting against colonization by serovars within serogroups b and d. such vectors would have the additional benefit of reducing colonization of important salmonella serovars.

TI  == ethanolamine utilization contributes to proliferation of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium in food and in nematodes.
AB  == only three pathogenic bacterial species, salmonella enterica, clostridium perfringens, and listeria monocytogenes, are able to utilize both ethanolamine and 1,2-propanediol as a sole carbon source. degradation of these substrates, abundant in food and the gut, depends on cobalamin, which is synthesized de novo  only under anaerobic conditions. although the eut, pdu, and cob-cbi gene clusters comprise 40 kb, the conditions under which they confer a selection advantage on these food-borne pathogens remain largely unknown. here we used the luciferase reporter system to determine the response of the salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium promoters p(euts), p(pocr), p(pduf), and p(pdua) to a set of carbon sources, to egg yolk, to whole milk, and to milk protein or fat fractions. depending on the supplements, specific inductions up to 3 orders of magnitude were observed for p(euts) and p(pdua), which drive the expression of most eut and pdu genes. to correlate these significant expression data with growth properties, nonpolar deletions of pocr, regulating the pdu and cob-cbi genes, and of eutr, involved in eut gene activation, were constructed in s. typhimurium strain 14028. during exponential growth of the mutants 14028deltapocr and 14028deltaeutr, 2- to 3-fold-reduced proliferation in milk and egg yolk was observed. using the caenorhabditis elegans infection model, we could also demonstrate that the proliferation of s. typhimurium in the nematode is supported by an active ethanolamine degradation pathway. taking these findings together, this study quantifies the differential expression of eut and pdu genes under distinct conditions and provides experimental evidence that the ethanolamine utilization pathway allows salmonellae to occupy specific metabolic niches within food environments and within their host organisms.

TI  == probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and taiwanese pickled cabbage.
AB  == this study assessed potential probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and from taiwanese pickled cabbage for their possible use in probiotic fermented foods by evaluating their (i) in vitro adhesive ability, resistance to biotic stress, resistance to pathogenic bacteria, and production of beta-galactosidase; (ii) milk technological properties; and (iii) in vivo adhesive ability, intestinal survival and microbial changes during and after treatment. five lactobacillus isolates identified as lactobacillus reuteri  f03, lactobacillus paracasei f08, lactobacillus rhamnosus f14, lactobacillus plantarum c06, and lactobacillus acidophilus c11 that showed resistance to gastric juice and bile salts were selected for further evaluation of their probiotic properties. all the strains demonstrated the ability to adhere to caco-2 cells, particularly, strain l. plantarum c06 and l. reuteri f03 showed satisfactory abilities, which were similar to that of the reference strain l. rhamnosus gg. the strains l. paracasei f08 and l. acidophilus c11 had the highest beta-galactosidase activity. most of the strains were resistant to aminoglycosides and vancomycin but sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, and penicillin. all the 5 strains elicited antibacterial activity against both gram-positive (bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus) and -negative (escherichia coli and salmonella enterica) pathogens. moreover, the strains l. reuteri f03, l. paracasei f08, and l. plantarum c06 could grow rapidly in milk without nutrient supplementation and reached 10(8) cfu/ml after 24 h of fermentation at 37 degrees c. the viable cell counts of the 3 strains remained above 10(7) cfu/ml after 21 d of storage at 4 degrees c. in the animal feeding trial, the number of intestinal lactobacilli increased significantly after administration of milk fermented with the 3 strains, and the counts of fecal coliforms and clostridium perfringens were markedly reduced. lactobacillus strains could also survive in the ileal intestinal tissue of the treated rats. technologically interesting lactobacillus isolates may be used in the future as probiotic starter cultures for manufacturing novel fermented foods.

AB  == application of risk analysis to control pork-borne zoonoses on farms is a major aim of the current european food safety legislation. the prevalence, levels of contamination and variations in pig contaminations according to herds and batches must therefore be studied to define relevant methods for control of zoonoses. the aims of this exploratory study were to provide information on the prevalence and  levels of infection of finisher/fattening pigs by campylobacter spp., clostridium perfringens, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica and staphylococcus aureus, and to quantify the respective effects of batches and herds. one hundred  and twenty-seven pooled fresh feces samples and 120 pooled cutaneous swab samples were tested from 37 batches in 14 farrowing-to-finishing farms. campylobacter spp. was identified in all fecal samples on farms whereas l. monocytogenes was never found. c. perfringens was identified in 48% of samples, salmonella in 2%, and s. aureus in 48%. the decomposition of variance of on-farm prevalence and levels of contamination and a general linear model showed a systematically significant effect of herd, and an effect of batch only for levels of contamination with campylobacter and c. perfringens and for prevalence of s. aureus. the contamination status of pigs seems to be mainly explained by herd status linked to poor biosecurity measures. further studies are needed to explain such correlations in order to define farm indicators for food-borne zoonotic hazards.

TI  == antibacterial effect of the bioactive compound beauvericin produced by fusarium proliferatum on solid medium of wheat.
AB  == to obtain the bioactive compound beauvericin (bea), fusarium proliferatum cect 20569 was grown on a solid medium of wheat, utilizing the technique of the solid  state fermentation (ssf), being this mycotoxin purified by high performance liquid chromatography (hplc) with a reverse phase semi-preparative column using as the mobile phase acetonitrile/water in gradient condition. the purity of the bea was verified by analytical hplc and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (lc/ms-ms). the pure fractions of bea were utilized to determinate the antibiotic effects on several bacterial strains that are considered normally  pathogens of the intestinal tract as: escherichia coli, enterococcus faecium, salmonella enterica, shigella dysenteriae, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic activities of animal intestinal strains against swine-associated pathogens.
AB  == a wide range of enteropathogens cause costly diarrhoeal diseases in fattening piglets and account for food-related infections in humans. the objective of this  study was to screen beneficial bacterial strains from the gastrointestinal tract  of various animal sources for antagonistic activity against diverse pathogens associated with hazardous pig production times. using agar spot assays, 15 well-characterized strains belonging to lactobacillus, enterococcus, bifidobacterium and bacillus were studied for inhibition of clostridium perfringens type a, various serovars of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, as well as brachyspira pilosicoli. strong antagonists were further analyzed by studying their cell-free supernatants with and without ph neutralization, proteinase k and catalase treatment. enterobacteriaceae were effectively inhibited by lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus reuteri strains, independent from the animal source, and on a lower level by single strains belonging to lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus amylovorus and bifidobacterium thermophilum, due to organic acid production. the bacillus subtilis strain was found to produce an anti-clostridial and anti-brachyspira metabolite of proteinaceous nature. homofermentative lactobacilli and b. thermophilum could suppress the growth of b. pilosicoli, the causative agent of intestinal spirochaetosis, whereas heterofermentative strains belonging to l. reuteri and l. mucosae had no effect. the lactic acid bacteria exerted their activity primarily by organic acid release, except one enterococcus faecium and l. amylovorus strain, which exhibited antagonism through joint activity of lactate and hydrogen peroxide. the findings of this study provide a basis for further in vitro studies and encourage feeding studies to evaluate the antagonistic potential of promising strains in pig production.

TI  == a live oral recombinant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium vaccine expressing clostridium perfringens antigens confers protection against necrotic enteritis in broiler chickens.
AB  == necrotic enteritis (ne) in broiler chickens is caused by clostridium perfringens, and there is currently no effective vaccine for ne. we previously showed that in  broiler chickens protection against ne can be achieved through intramuscular immunization with alpha toxin (at) and hypothetical protein (hp), and we subsequently identified b-cell epitopes in hp. in the present study, we identified b-cell epitopes in at recognized by chickens immune to ne. the gene fragments encoding immunodominant epitopes of at as well as those of hp were codon optimized for salmonella and cloned into pya3493, and the resultant plasmid constructs were introduced into an attenuated salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium chi9352 vaccine vehicle. the expression of these clostridium perfringens proteins, alpha toxoid (atd) and truncated hp (hpt), was confirmed by immunoblotting. the protection of broiler chickens against experimentally induced ne was assessed at both the moderate and the severe levels of challenge. birds immunized orally with salmonella expressing atd were significantly protected against moderate ne, and there was a nonsignificant trend for protection against  severe challenge, whereas hpt-immunized birds were significantly protected against both severities of challenge. immunized birds developed serum igy and mucosal iga and igy antibody responses against clostridium and salmonella antigens. in conclusion, this study identified, for the first time, the b-cell epitopes in at from an ne isolate recognized by chickens and showed the partial protective ability of codon-optimized atd and hpt against ne in broiler chickens  when they were delivered orally by using a salmonella vaccine vehicle.

TI  == the long-lived nature of clostridium perfringens iota toxin in mammalian cells induces delayed apoptosis.
AB  == mono-adp ribosylation of actin by bacterial toxins, such as clostridium perfringens iota or clostridium botulinum c2 toxins, results in rapid depolymerization of actin filaments and cell rounding. here we report that treatment of african green monkey kidney (vero) cells with iota toxin resulted in delayed caspase-dependent death. unmodified actin did not reappear in toxin-treated cells, and enzyme-active toxin was detectable in the cytosol for at least 24 h. c2 toxin showed comparable, long-lived effects in cells, while a c2 toxin control lacking adp-ribosyltransferase activity did not induce cell death.  to address whether the remarkable stability of the iota and c2 toxins in cytosol  was crucial for inducing cell death, we treated cells with c/spvb, the catalytic  domain of salmonella enterica spvb. although c/spvb also mono-adp ribosylates actin as do the iota and c2 toxins, cells treated with a cell-permeating c/spvb fusion toxin became rounded but recovered and remained viable. moreover, unmodified actin reappeared in these cells, and adp-ribosyltransferase activity due to c/spvb was not detectable in the cytosol after 24 h, a result most likely  due to degradation of c/spvb. repeated application of c/spvb prevented recovery of cells and reappearance of unmodified actin. in conclusion, a complete but transient adp ribosylation of actin was not sufficient to trigger apoptosis, implying that long-term stability of actin-adp-ribosylating toxins, such as iota  and c2, in the cytosol is crucial for inducing delayed, caspase-dependent cell death.

TI  == simultaneous identification of seven foodborne pathogens and escherichia coli (pathogenic and nonpathogenic) using capillary electrophoresis-based single-strand conformation polymorphism coupled with multiplex pcr.
AB  == the objective of this study was to develop a novel technique for parallel analysis of eight important foodborne microbes using capillary electrophoresis-based single-strand conformation polymorphism (ce-sscp) coupled with multiplex pcr. specific primers for multiplex pcr amplification of the 16s rrna gene were designed, corresponding to eight species of bacteria, including escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, campylobacter jejuni, salmonella enterica, listeria monocytogenes, vibrio parahaemolyticus, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus, for the species-specific identification and optimal separation of their pcr products in subsequent analysis by ce-sscp. multiplex pcr conditions including annealing temperature, extension time, the number of pcr cycles, and primer concentrations were then optimized for simultaneous detection  of all target foodborne bacteria. the diagnostic system using ce-sscp combined with multiplex pcr developed here can be used for rapid investigation of causative agents of foodborne illness. the simplicity and high sensitivity of the method may lead to improved management of safety and illness related to food.

AB  == objectives: to describe the epidemiology of an outbreak of salmonella enteritidis phage type 1 (pt1) infection associated with a fast food premises, and to identify the causative factors leading to an acute outbreak with high attack rate and severe illness including hospital admission. study design: integrated descriptive study of epidemiology, food and environmental microbiology, and professional environmental health assessment, supplemented by a case-case analytical study. methods: cases were identified through multiple sources and were interviewed to identify food items consumed. descriptive epidemiology of all cases and a case-case analytical study of risk factors for severe illness were undertaken. microbiological investigation included analysis and typing of pathogens from stools, blood and environmental surfaces. professional environmental heath assessment of the premises was undertaken. results: s. enteritidis pt1 was recovered from two-thirds of faecal samples. three cases had  dual infection with enterotoxin-producing clostridium perfringens. s. enteritidis pt1 was isolated from 14 of 40 food samples examined and c. perfringens was isolated from eight food samples. environmental health inspection of the premises revealed multiple deficiencies, including deficits in food preparation and hygiene consistent with multiple cross-contamination, and time-temperature abuse  of sauces widely used across menu items. severe cases were associated with consumption of chips and salad. conclusions: outbreaks from fast food premises have been infrequently described. this outbreak demonstrates the potential for fast food premises, with multiple deficiencies in food preparation and hygiene, to produce large, intense community outbreaks with high attack rates and severe illness, highly confined in space and time.

AB  == necrotic enteritis (ne) in broiler chickens is caused by clostridium perfringens  but currently no effective vaccine is available. our previous study showed that certain c. perfringens secreted proteins when administered intramuscularly protected chickens against experimental infection. in the current study, genes encoding three c. perfringens proteins: fructose-biphosphate-aldolase (fba), pyruvate:ferredoxin-oxidoreductase (pfor) and hypothetical protein (hp), were cloned into an avirulent salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium vaccine vector. broiler chickens immunized orally with recombinant salmonella expressing fba or hp proteins were significantly protected against ne challenge. immunized birds developed serum and mucosal antibodies to both clostridial and salmonella antigens. this study showed the oral immunizing ability of two c. perfringens antigens against ne in broiler chickens through an attenuated salmonella vaccine  vector.

TI  == recombinant attenuated salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium expressing the carboxy-terminal domain of alpha toxin from clostridium perfringens induces protective responses against necrotic enteritis in chickens.
AB  == clostridium perfringens-induced necrotic enteritis (ne) is a widespread disease in chickens that causes high mortality and reduced growth performance. traditionally, ne was controlled by the routine application of antimicrobials in  the feed, a practice that currently is unpopular. consequently, there has been an increase in the occurrence of ne, and it has become a threat to the current objective of antimicrobial-free farming. the pathogenesis of ne is associated with the proliferation of c. perfringens in the small intestine and the secretion of large amounts of alpha toxin, the major virulence factor. since there is no vaccine for ne, we have developed a candidate live oral recombinant attenuated salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium vaccine (rasv) that delivers a nontoxic fragment of alpha toxin. the 3' end of the plc gene, encoding the c-terminal domain of alpha toxin (plcc), was cloned into plasmids that enable the expression and secretion of plcc fused to a signal peptide. plasmids were inserted into salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium host strain chi8914, which has attenuating paba and pabb deletion mutations. three-day-old broiler chicks were orally immunized with 10(9) cfu of the vaccine strain and developed alpha toxin-neutralizing serum antibodies. when serum from these chickens was added into c. perfringens broth cultures, bacterial growth was suppressed. in addition, immunofluorescent microscopy showed that serum antibodies bind to the bacterial surface. the immunoglobulin g (igg) and iga titers in rasv-immunized chickens were low; however, when the chickens were given a parenteral boost injection with a purified recombinant plcc protein (rplcc), the rasv-immunized chickens mounted  rapid high serum igg and bile iga titers exceeding those primed by rplcc injection. rasv-immunized chickens had reduced intestinal mucosal pathology after challenge with virulent c. perfringens. these results indicate that oral rasv expressing an alpha toxin c-terminal peptide induces protective immunity against  ne.

TI  == influence of gastric acid on susceptibility to infection with ingested bacterial  pathogens.
AB  == despite the widely held belief that gastric acid serves as a barrier to bacterial pathogens, there are almost no experimental data to support this hypothesis. we have developed a mouse model to quantify the effectiveness of gastric acid in mediating resistance to infection with ingested bacteria. mice that were constitutively hypochlorhydric due to a mutation in a gastric h(+)/k(+)-atpase (proton pump) gene were infected with yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, citrobacter rodentium, or clostridium perfringens cells or spores. significantly greater numbers of yersinia, salmonella, and citrobacter cells (p < or = 0.006) and clostridium spores (p = 0.02) survived in  hypochlorhydric mice, resulting in reduced median infectious doses. experiments involving intraperitoneal infection or infection of mice treated with antacids indicated that the increased sensitivity of hypochlorhydric mice to infection was entirely due to the absence of stomach acid. apart from establishing the role of  gastric acid in nonspecific immunity to ingested bacterial pathogens, our model provides an excellent system with which to investigate the effects of hypochlorhydria on susceptibility to infection and to evaluate the in vivo susceptibility to gastric acid of orally administered therapies, such as vaccines and probiotics.

TI  == nucleoside analogues are activated by bacterial deoxyribonucleoside kinases in a  species-specific manner.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the bactericidal activity of antiviral and anticancer  nucleoside analogues against a variety of pathogenic bacteria and characterize the activating enzymes, deoxyribonucleoside kinases (dnks). methods: several fda-approved nucleoside analogue drugs were screened for their potential bactericidal activity against several clinical bacterial isolates and type strains. we identified and subcloned the genes coding for putative deoxyribonucleoside kinases in escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, salmonella enterica, yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and listeria monocytogenes. these genes were tested for their ability to increase the susceptibility of a dnk-deficient e. coli strain to various analogues. we overexpressed, purified and characterized the substrate specificity and kinetic properties of the recombinant enzymes from s. enterica and b. cereus. results: the tested gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (azt) in the concentration range 0.032-31.6 microm except for a single e. coli isolate and two pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates which were resistant to the tested azt concentrations. purified recombinant s. enterica thymidine kinase phosphorylated azt efficiently with a km of 73.3 microm and k(cat)/km of 6.6 x 10(4) s(-1) m(-1) and is the activator of this drug in vivo. 2',2'-difluoro-2'-deoxycytidine (gemcitabine) was a potent antibiotic against gram-positive bacteria in the concentration range between 0.001 and 1.0 microm. the b. cereus deoxyadenosine kinase had a km for gemcitabine of 33.5 microm and k(cat)/km of 5.1 x 10(3) s(-1) m(-1) and activates gemcitabine in vivo. s. enterica and b. cereus are now amongst the first bacteria with a completely characterized set of dnk enzymes. conclusions: bacterial dnks efficiently activate nucleoside analogues in a species-specific manner. therefore, nucleoside analogues have a potential to be employed as antibiotics in the fight against emerging multiresistant bacteria.

TI  == the beta-defensin gallinacin-6 is expressed in the chicken digestive tract and has antimicrobial activity against food-borne pathogens.
AB  == food-borne pathogens are responsible for most cases of food poisoning in developed countries and are often associated with poultry products, including chicken. little is known about the role of beta-defensins in the chicken digestive tract and their efficacy. in this study, the expression of chicken beta-defensin gallinacin-6 (gal-6) and its antimicrobial activity against food-borne pathogens were investigated. reverse transcription-pcr analysis showed high expression of gal-6 mrna in the esophagus and crop, moderate expression in the glandular stomach, and low expression throughout the intestinal tract. putative transcription factor binding sites for nuclear factor kappa beta, activator protein 1, and nuclear factor interleukin-6 were found in the gal-6 gene upstream region, which suggests a possible inducible nature of the gal-6 gene. in colony-counting assays, strong bactericidal and fungicidal activity was  observed, including bactericidal activity against food-borne pathogens campylobacter jejuni, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, clostridium perfringens, and escherichia coli. treatment with 16 mug/ml synthetic gal-6 resulted in a 3 log unit reduction in clostridium perfringens survival within 60  min, indicating fast killing kinetics. transmission electron microscopy examination of synthetic-gal-6-treated clostridium perfringens cells showed dose-dependent changes in morphology after 30 min, including intracellular granulation, cytoplasm retraction, irregular septum formation in dividing cells,  and cell lysis. the high expression in the proximal digestive tract and broad antimicrobial activity suggest that chicken beta-defensin gallinacin-6 plays an important role in chicken innate host defense.

AB  == buoyant density gradient centrifugation has been used to separate bacteria from complex food matrices, as well as to remove compounds that inhibit rapid detection methods, such as pcr, and to prevent false-positive results due to dna  originating from dead cells. applying a principle of buoyant density gradient centrifugation, we developed a method for rapid separation and concentration following filtration and low- and high-speed centrifugation, as well as flotation and sedimentation buoyant density centrifugation, for 12 food-borne pathogens (salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, campylobacter jejuni, vibrio cholerae o139, vibrio parahaemolyticus o3k6, vibrio vulnificus, providencia alcalifaciens, aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus  aureus, and clostridium perfringens) in 13 different food homogenates. this method can be used prior to real-time quantitative pcr (rti-qpcr) and viable-cell counting. using this combined method, the target organisms in the food samples theoretically could be concentrated 250-fold and detected at cell concentrations  as low as 10(1) to 10(3) cfu/g using the rti-qpcr assay, and amounts as small as  10(0) to 10(1) cfu/g could be isolated using plate counting. the combined separation and concentration methods and rti-qpcr confirmed within 3 h the presence of 10(1) to 10(2) cfu/g of salmonella and c. jejuni directly in naturally contaminated chicken and the presence of s. aureus directly in remaining food items in a poisoning outbreak. these results illustrated the feasibility of using these assays for rapid inspection of bacterial food contamination during a real-world outbreak.

TI  == effect of tea phenolics and their aromatic fecal bacterial metabolites on intestinal microbiota.
AB  == tea is rich in polyphenols and other phenolics that have been widely reported to  have beneficial health effects. however, dietary polyphenols are not completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and are metabolized by the gut microflora so that they and their metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. in this study, we investigated the influence of the phenolic components of a tea extract and their aromatic metabolites upon bacterial growth. fecal homogenates containing bacteria significantly catalyzed tea phenolics, including epicatechin, catechin, 3-o-methyl gallic acid, gallic acid and caffeic acid to generate aromatic metabolites dependent on bacterial species. different strains of intestinal bacteria had varying degrees of growth sensitivity to tea phenolics and metabolites. growth of certain pathogenic bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile and bacteroides spp. was significantly repressed by tea phenolics and their derivatives, while commensal anaerobes like clostridium spp., bifidobacterium spp. and probiotics such as lactobacillus sp. were less severely affected. this indicates that tea phenolics exert significant effects on the intestinal environment by modulation of the intestinal bacterial population, probably by acting as metabolic prebiotics. our observations provide further evidence for the importance of colonic bacteria in the metabolism, absorption and potential activity of phenolics in human health and disease. the bioactivity of different phenolics may play an important role in the maintenance of gastrointestinal health.

TI  == comparison of the concentrations of phenolic compounds in olive oils and other plant oils: correlation with antimicrobial activity.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of different edible vegetable oils was studied. in vitro results revealed that the oils from olive fruits had a strong bactericidal  action against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, this effect being higher in general against gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. thus, olive oils showed bactericidal activity not only against harmful bacteria of the intestinal  microbiota (clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli) also against beneficial microorganisms such as lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum. otherwise, most of the foodborne pathogens tested (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica, yersinia sp., and shigella sonnei) did not survive after 1 h of contact with olive oils. the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl oleuropein and ligstroside aglycons, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol,  were the phenolic compounds that statistically correlated with bacterial survival. these findings were confirmed by testing each individual phenolic compound, isolated by hplc, against l. monocytogenes. in particular, the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl ligstroside aglycon showed a potent antimicrobial activity. these results indicate that not all oils classified as "olive oil" had similar bactericidal effects and that this bioactivity depended on their content of certain phenolic compounds.

TI  == salmonella enterica spvb adp-ribosylates actin at position arginine-177-characterization of the catalytic domain within the spvb protein and a comparison to binary clostridial actin-adp-ribosylating toxins.
AB  == the spvb protein from salmonella enterica was recently discovered as an actin-adp-ribosylating toxin. spvb is most likely delivered via a type-iii secretion system into eukaryotic cells and does not have a binding/translocation  component. this is in contrast to the family of binary actin-adp-ribosylating toxins from various bacillus and clostridium species. however, there are homologies in amino acid sequences between the c-terminal domain of spvb and the  catalytic domains of the actin-adp-ribosylating toxins such as c2 toxin from clostridium botulinum and iota toxin from clostridium perfringens. we compared the biochemical properties of the catalytic c-terminal domain of spvb (c/spvb) with the enzyme components of c2 toxin and iota toxin. the specificity of c/spvb  concerning the modification of g- or f-actin was comparable to the c2 and iota toxins, although there were distinct differences regarding the recognition of actin isoforms. c/spvb and iota toxin modify both muscle alpha-actin and nonmuscle beta/gamma-actin, whereas c2 toxin only modifies beta/gamma-actin. in contrast to the iota and c2 toxins, c/spvb possessed no detectable glycohydrolase activity in the absence of a protein substrate. the maximal reaction rates were comparable for all toxins, whereas variable k(m) values for nad were evident. we  identified arginine-177 as the modification site for c/spvb with the actin homologue protein act88f from drosophila.

TI  == metabolic activation of bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene, 4-aminobiphenyl, and benzidine by pseudomonas aeruginosa and other human endogenous bacteria.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen of the human urinary tract, and other selected human endogenous bacteria were investigated for metabolic activation of the bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene (2-af), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ab), and benzidine (bz). the cell-free extracts of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, klebsiella pneumoniae,  and intestinal anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and eubacterium aerofaciens produced increased histidine revertant frequencies with the tester strain salmonella typhimurium ta98 in the ames salmonella mutagenicity assay. in addition, the cell-free extracts of pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, and eubacterium aerofaciens each showed the presence of a cytochrome p450 absorption peak in the carbon monoxide (co) difference spectrum. this was not demonstratable for the other bacteria. our findings indicate that human endogenous bacteria, which are opportunistic pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically activate the bladder procarcinogens 2-af, 4-ab, and bz into mutagens. the metabolic activation by pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, and eubacterium aerofaciens is mediated by a cytochrome p450 enzyme. for those organisms that induced metabolic activation but did not show a p450 absorption peak with the cell-free extracts, other oxidative enzymes may be involved.

TI  == one-bead-one-inhibitor-one-substrate screening of neuraminidase activity.
AB  == given the eminent threat of a 21st century flu pandemic, the search for novel antiviral compounds is an increasingly important area of research. recent developments in antiviral research have established the viability of targeting viral neuraminidase (na), an enzyme that cleaves sialic acid from the cell-surface-mediating passage of the virus in the respiratory tract. n-acetyl neuraminic acid (neuac) is the substrate for na, and analogues of this core structure have been commercialized as antiviral therapeutics. recent studies have established that this system is well suited for combinatorial approaches to drug  discovery. an important step in the process is to develop solid-phase screening technologies. the feasibility of performing competitive solid-phase na assays is  reported herein. initially, a fluorogenic neuac substrate was immobilized on solid support, and the ability of three nas (clostridium perfringens, salmonella  typhimurium, and vibrio cholerae) to cleave the substrate was shown to be analogous to solution-phase assays. the solid support was then bifunctionalized with the fluorogenic neuac substrate and one of two known inhibitors (dana and zanamivir). the ability of na to cleave neuac from the solid support when simultaneously presented with an inhibitor was shown to be enzyme dependent. as expected, simultaneous presentation of neuac and dana, a nonspecific inhibitor, led to diminished activity for all three enzymes tested. in contrast, dual presentation of neuac and the selective inhibitor zanamivir only showed significant activity against vibrio cholerae.

TI  == effect of relative humidity on preharvest survival of bacterial and viral pathogens on the surface of cantaloupe, lettuce, and bell peppers.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to compare the effects of humidity on the preharvest survival of microbial pathogens on cantaloupe, lettuce, and bell peppers. an additional goal was to evaluate clostridium perfringens as an indicator of fecal contamination on produce. the microorganisms used in this study included escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, shigella sonnei, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica, clostridium perfringens, hepatitis a virus (hav), feline calicivirus (fcv), and coliphage prd1. the study took place in a controlled environment chamber that allowed for the control of temperature (18 to 26 degrees c) and relative humidity. survival rates under high (mean, 85.7 to 90.3%) and low (mean, 45.1 to 48.4%) relative humidity were compared. the surfaces of the edible portion of each plant were inoculated with the study microorganisms. samples were collected throughout 2 weeks. more microorganisms survived significantly longer (p < 0.05) on cantaloupe than on lettuce and bell peppers. the type of produce on which each organism experienced the highest inactivation rate tended to change with relative humidity. the survival of microorganisms on produce surfaces was not uniformly affected by relative humidity. of the studied microorganisms, hav, prd1, and c. perfringens were found to have the lowest inactivation rates, whereas fcv and e. coli atcc 25922 tended  to become inactivated most rapidly. c. perfringens generally survived longer than all other bacteria and fcv in all experiments. this trend suggests that c. perfringens may be an acceptable indicator of bacterial contamination and survival in various environments and on different types of crops.

TI  == use of conformationally restricted pyridinium alpha-d-n-acetylneuraminides to probe specificity in bacterial and viral sialidases.
AB  == investigations into subtle changes in the catalytic activity of sialidases have been performed using enzymes from several different origins, and their results have been compared. this work highlights the potential pitfalls encountered when  extending conclusions derived from mechanistic studies on a single enzyme even to those with high-sequence homology. specifically, a panel of 5 pyridinium n-acetylneuraminides were used as substrates in a study that revealed subtle differences in the catalytic mechanisms used by 4 different sialidase enzymes. the lowest reactivity towards the artificial (pyridinium) substrates was displayed by the newcastle disease virus hemagglutinin-neuraminidase. moreover, in reactions involving aryl n-acetylneuraminides, the activity of the newcastle enzyme was competitively inhibited by the 3,4-dihydro-2h-pyrano[3,2-c]pyridinium  compound with a ki = 58 micromol/l. alternatively, the 3 bacterial enzymes tested, from salmonella typhimurium, clostridium perfringens, and vibrio cholerae, were catalytically active against all members of the panel of substrates. based on the observed effect of leaving-group ability, it is proposed that the rate-determining step for kcat (and likely for kcat/km as well) with each bacterial enzyme is as follows: sialylation, which is concerted with conformational change for v. cholerae; and conformational change for s. typhimurium and c. perfringens.

TI  == the influence of whole wheat feeding on salmonella infection and gut flora composition in broilers.
AB  == in an experiment with broilers infected with a rifampicin-resistant salmonella typhimurium strain at 15 days of age, it was demonstrated that whole wheat feeding influenced the course of infection. the ph in the contents of the gizzard decreased as the amount of whole wheat in the diet increased over time. following infection, lower numbers of salmonella typhimurium were found in the gizzard and  ileum of birds receiving whole wheat compared to pellet-fed birds. however, there was no difference with respect to the numbers of salmonella typhimurium in the ceca and rectum between the two experimental groups. quantitative cultivation of  different groups of bacteria belonging to the natural intestinal microflora showed that whole wheat feeding significantly reduced the numbers of clostridium  perfringens in the intestinal tract of the birds. the present results indicate that the gizzard has an important function as a barrier organ, one that prevents  pathogenic bacteria from entering the distal digestive tract.

TI  == ligand binding properties of bacterial hemoglobins and flavohemoglobins.
AB  == bacterial hemoglobins and flavohemoglobins share a common globin fold but differ  otherwise in structural and functional aspects. the bases of these differences were investigated through kinetic studies on oxygen, carbon monoxide, and nitric  oxide binding. the novel bacterial hemoglobins from clostridium perfringens and campylobacter jejuni and the flavohemoglobins from bacillus subtilis and salmonella enterica serovar typhi have been analyzed. examination of the biochemical and ligand binding properties of these proteins shows a clear distinction between the two groups. flavohemoglobins show a much greater tendency to autoxidation compared to bacterial hemoglobins. the differences in affinity for oxygen, carbon monoxide, and nitric oxide between bacterial hemoglobins and flavohemoglobins are mainly due to differences in the association rate constants. the second-order rate constants for oxygen and carbon monoxide binding to bacterial hemoglobins are severalfold higher than those for flavohemoglobins. a similar trend is observed for no association with the oxidized iron(iii) form of  the proteins. no major differences are observed among the values obtained for the dissociation rate constants for the two groups of bacterial proteins studied, and these constants are all rather similar to those for myoglobin. taken together, our data suggest that differences exist between the mechanisms of ligand binding  to bacterial hemoglobins and flavohemoglobins, suggesting different functions in  the cell.

TI  == application of molecular genetic methods in diagnostics and epidemiology of food-borne bacterial pathogens.
AB  == salmonella enterica, campylobacter and yersinia species, shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec), listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens are the bacterial pathogens constituting the greatest burden of food-borne disease in finland. several molecular genetic methods have been applied to diagnose, discriminate and survey these bacteria. pcr, pcr-rflp and pfge are the most widely and successfully used. however, these methods are unable to replace conventional and internationally standardised phenotyping. electronic database libraries of the different genomic profiles will enable continuous surveillance of infections and detection of possible infection clusters at an early stage. furthermore, whole-genome sequence data have opened up new insights into epidemiological surveillance. laboratory-based surveillance performed in a timely manner and exploiting adequate methods, and co-operation at local, national and international levels are among the key elements in preventing food-borne diseases. this paper reviews different applications of molecular genetic methods  for investigating enteric bacterial pathogens and gives examples of the methods successfully used in diagnostics and epidemiological studies in finland.

TI  == application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  == a rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. nylon membrane was used as the array support. a mutation region of the 23s rrna gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. a pair of universal primers was designed for pcr amplification of the 23s rrna gene. twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. the 23s rrna gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, shigella dysenteriae, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, proteus vulgaris, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. two other species (salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with e. coli, but  the reaction did not affect their detection. after redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with staphylococcus aureus, but not  with clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pyogenes. the oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne  infections. the superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.

TI  == duplication is more common among laterally transferred genes than among indigenous genes.
AB  == background: recent developments in the understanding of paralogous evolution have prompted a focus not only on obviously advantageous genes, but also on genes that can be considered to have a weak or sporadic impact on the survival of the organism. here we examine the duplicative behavior of a category of genes that can be considered to be mostly transient in the genome, namely laterally transferred genes. using both a compositional method and a gene-tree approach, we identify a number of proposed laterally transferred genes and study their nucleotide composition and frequency of duplication. results: it is found that duplications are significantly overrepresented among potential laterally transferred genes compared to the indigenous ones. furthermore, the gc3 distribution of potential laterally transferred genes was found to be largely uniform in some genomes, suggesting an import from a broad range of donors. conclusions: the results are discussed not in a context of strongly optimized established genes, but rather of genes with weak or ancillary functions. the importance of duplication may therefore depend on the variability and availability of weak genes for which novel functions may be discovered. therefore, lateral transfer may accelerate the evolutionary process of duplication by bringing foreign genes that have mainly weak or no function into the genome.

AB  == cost effective control of avian diseases and food borne pathogens remains a high  priority for all sectors of the poultry industry with cleansing and disinfection, vaccination and competitive exclusion approaches being used widely. previous studies showed that bacillus subtilis py79(hr) was an effective competitive exclusion agent for use in poultry to control avian pathogenic escherichia coli serotype o78:k80. here we report experiments that were undertaken to test the efficacy of b. subtilis py79(hr) in the control of salmonella enterica serotype enteritidis and clostridium perfringens in young chickens. to do this, 1-day-old  and 20-day-old specific pathogen free (spf) chicks were dosed with a suspension of b. subtilis spores prior to challenge with s. enteritidis (s1400) and c. perfringens, respectively. for both challenge models, a single oral inoculum of 1x10(9) spores given 24h prior to challenge was sufficient to suppress colonisation and persistence of both s. enteritidis and c. perfringens. in particular, the faecal shedding of s. enteritidis, as measured by a semi-quantitative cloacal swabbing technique, was reduced significantly for the 36 days duration of the experiment. b. subtilis persisted in the intestine although with decreasing numbers over the same period. these data add further evidence that b. subtilis spores may be effective agents in the control of avian  diseases and food borne pathogens.

TI  == multivalency and the mode of action of bacterial sialidases.
AB  == although complex modular proteins are encountered frequently in a variety of biological systems, their occurrence in biocatalysis has not been widely appreciated. here, we describe that bacterial sialidases, which have both a catalytic and carbohydrate-binding domain, can hydrolyze polyvalent substrates with much greater catalytic efficiency than their monovalent counterparts. the enhancement of catalytic efficiency was due to a much smaller michaelis constant  and rationalized by a model in which the catalytic and lectin domains interact simultaneously with the polyvalent substrate, leading to an enhancement of affinity. inhibition studies have shown that galactosides released by the action  of the sialidase can act as the ligand for the lectin domain. this knowledge has  been exploited in the design of a potent polyvalent inhibitor of the sialidase of vibrio cholerae, which displayed exquisite selectivities for sialidases that have a lectin domain.

AB  == selected probiotic lactic acid bacteria (lab) have been shown to elicit positive  health effects particularly in humans. competitive exclusion of pathogens is one  of the most important beneficial health claims of probiotic bacteria. the effect  of probiotic lab on competitive exclusion of pathogens has been demonstrated in humans, chicken and pigs. in this study we evaluated the ability of certain lab strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium lactis bb12, lactobacillus pentosus uk1a, l. pentosus sk2a, enterococcus faecium m74 and e. faecium sf273) to inhibit the adhesion of selected canine and zoonotic pathogens (staphylococcus intermedius, salmonella typhimurium atcc 14028, clostridium perfringens and campylobacter jejuni) to immobilised mucus isolated from canine jejunal chyme in  vitro. adhesion of c. perfringens was reduced significantly by all tested lab strains, between 53.7 and 79.1% of the control without lab, the lab of canine origin yielding the best reduction. the adhesion of s. typhimurium and s. intermedius were not significantly altered by any of the lab included in the study. both enterococci tested significantly enhanced the adhesion of c. jejuni,  to 134.6 and 205.5% of the control without lab. e. faecium may thus favor the adhesion and colonization of c. jejuni in the dog's intestine, making it a potential carrier and possibly a source for human infection. enhanced c. jejuni adhesion is a new potential risk factor of enterococci. our results further emphasize the importance of safety guidelines to be established for the probiotics intended for animal use.

TI  == regrowth and survival of indicator microorganisms on the surfaces of household containers used for the storage of drinking water in rural communities of south africa.
AB  == the present study covered two rural communities of south africa: ncera and ntselamanzi villages. raw water from ncera river is used by the community of ncera village for drinking, while the community of ntselamanzi receives their drinking water from alice purification system. treated water is supplied to the community by a public standpipe system. in rural communities of south africa, many households use polyethylene (pe) and galvanized steel (gs) containers for the storage of their drinking water. to investigate the regrowth and survival of  indicator microorganisms on the surface of household containers during the storage of drinking water, pe and gs slides were suspended in the appropriate household containers for a period of 48 h. this period of 48 h was chosen as the  study period because results from the questionnaire indicated that the largest percentage (62%) of households store their water for that length of time. the experiment was performed to test drinking water as it is collected and stored by  rural communities. no disinfection of household containers or slides was done during the study period. attached coliphages (f-rna (fp) and somatic phage (sp),  coliform bacteria (total coliform (tc), presumptive escherichia coli (ec), salmonella (sal) and clostridium perfringens (cp) were measured during the study  period. with the exception of cp, attached indicator microorganisms consisted of  tc, presumptive e. coli and salmonella, somatic and f-rna coliphages, although the yield (average count) for the last four groups (ec: < 1-3 cfu cm(-2), sal: <  1-15 cfu cm(-2), fp: < 1-7 pfu cm(-2), sp: < 1-7pfu cm(-2)) was lower than that of tc (3-183 cfu cm(-2)). however, the lowest yield of indicator microorganisms was noted for presumptive e. coli. whereas the occurrence and survival of tc was  noted on the surface of household containers during the entire period of the experimental study, other indicator microorganisms occurred from time to time. the regrowth of indicator microorganisms occurred 48 h after the exposure of slides to both types of test waters. this length of time mostly resulted in the regrowth of tc (with an increase in bacterial counts) while the persistence of other indicator organism groups on the surface of the slides was apparent. a comparison between pe and gs containers showed that more tc (average count) regrew on pe than on gs containers (for river water, pe: from 36 to 55 cfu cm(-2), gs: from 25 to 26 cfu cm(-2); for standpipe water, pe: from 147 to 183 cfu cm(-2), gs from 3 to 4 cfu cm(-2)). this study revealed that both types of household containers supported the growth and survival of indicator microorganisms due to the bad quality of the intake water before storage. the storage of drinking water for 48 h mainly resulted in the regrowth of tc. nevertheless, the persistence of other indicator microorganisms was observed on the surface of household containers.

AB  == the enterotoxaemia syndrome in belgian blue calves is characterised by a high case fatality rate, sudden death, lesions of haemorrhagic enteritis of the small  intestine and, quite often an absence of other clinical signs but its cause has not been yet identified. as a first step in this identification, the aerobic and  anaerobic intestinal flora of a population of 78 calves, originating from farms located in southern belgium and that died in circumstances defined as "calf enterotoxaemia" (study population) and of 64 calves that died in other circumstances (control population) were studied qualitatively and quantitatively. the colonies were identified after subcultures with appropriate api sugar sets. anaerobically clostridium perfringens was isolated in higher numbers (mean values of 10(7)-10(7.5) colony forming units (cfu) versus 10(4)-10(5) cfu per ml of intestinal content) and from more animals (79 versus 19%) in the study population than in the control population, although individual results from both populations could overlap. other clostridial species, i.e. mainly urease-negative c. sordellii and c. bifermentans, were isolated in high numbers (>10(6) cfu per ml of intestinal content) from a few animals in the study population only. all but one of the 705 c. perfringens isolates from both populations belonged to the a toxin type and none of the urease-negative c. sordellii was toxigenic. gram-negative anaerobes were not isolated in high numbers from any of the samples. aerobically beta-haemolytic e. coli were significantly more frequent among the study population, but were isolated from only 25% of the animals. salmonella typhimurium was isolated from only two animals in the study population. less than 1% of the e. coli isolated were verotoxigenic and one-third were necrotoxigenic. at this stage only non-enterotoxigenic type a c. perfringens are thus statistically associated with the enterotoxaemia syndrome in belgian blue calves and fulfil the first of the koch's postulates.

AB  == enteric bacterial infections are among the most common and economically significant diseases affecting swine production worldwide. clinical signs of these infections include diarrhea, reduced growth rate, weight loss, and death of preweaned, weanling, grower-finisher, young and adult age breeding animals. the most common etiological agents include escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, lawsonia intracellularis, salmonella enterica, and brachyspira (serpulina) spp. with the exception of brachyspira (serpulina) hyodysenteriae, the cause of swine  dysentery, and lawsonia intracellularis, the cause of proliferative enteropathy,  the pathological changes seen with these agents closely resemble the diseases occurring in human beings. histological changes in the intestines of swine with enteric bacterial infections include bacterial colonization without significant damage (e.g., certain enterotoxigenic e. coli and c. perfringens type a), attaching and effacing lesions with enteropathogenic e. coli and brachyspira pilosicoli, the cause of colonic spirochetosis, inflammation with s. enterica, and necrotizing and hemorrhagic lesions with certain c. perfringens. extraintestinal spread of bacteria and/or toxins occurs with some serotypes of e. coli and most serotypes of s. enterica. enteric bacterial diseases of swine have  been used as models to study the pathogenesis of similar diseases of human beings. several of these pathogens are also important causes of food-borne disease in humans.

AB  == the small nanh gene encoding a neuraminidase from clostridium perfringens atcc 10543 was cloned in jm109 using puc19 as a vector. sequence analysis revealed an  orf, nt 310-1455, encoding 382 amino acids that was proceeded by a typical shine-dalgarno sequence, ggacgaga. the nt sequence in the 15-402 region had in vivo promoter activity in an escherichia coli promoter probe plasmid pkk232-8, which suggested that the small nanh promoter is functional in e. coli. four regions of amino acids demonstrated great similarity to the "asp boxes" (-ser-x-asp-x-gly-x-thr-trp-) of other bacterial nanh proteins. the small nanh expressing clone, pcpn-1, which was cultured under aerobic conditions resulted in nanh activity which was 203-fold in culture and 211-fold in intracellular fraction compared to that of c. perfringens which has to be cultured under anaerobic conditions. production of small nanh was also induced by adding sialyllactose to the culture medium of jm109 [pcpn-1]. the enzyme activity could  be detected in the periplasmic fraction and the culture medium of jm109 [pcpn-1]  after culturing to the stationary phase. the molecular weight, k(m), and optimum  ph and pi of the cloned enzyme are identical to those of the parent strain. the cloned, small nanh could be used to study the structure-functional relationship of nanh, while the pcpn-1 clone could be used in the aerobic production of neuraminidase.

TI  == risk factors for outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease linked to domestic catering.
AB  == the epidemiology of general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering for large numbers is described and compared with foodborne outbreaks in other settings. from 1 january 1992 to 31 december 1994, the phls communicable disease surveillance centre identified 101 foodborne general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering in england and wales (16% of all foodborne outbreaks). salmonella species were associated with 77 of the 101 outbreaks and s. enteriditis phage type 4 accounted for 57. small round structured viruses were implicated in five outbreaks, clostridium perfringens in four, bacillus cereus in two, and campylobacter sp and escherichia coli in one each. no pathogen was identified in 11 outbreaks. outbreaks occurred most commonly in summer. the commonest vehicles implicated were poultry/eggs in 44 outbreaks, desserts in 13, and meat/meat products in nine. salad/vegetables, sauces, and fish/shellfish were each implicated in eight  outbreaks. raw shell eggs were implicated in a fifth of outbreaks. inappropriate  storage was the commonest fault, reported in association with 50 outbreaks (ambient temperature for long periods before serving in 29), inadequate heat treatment was reported in 35, cross contamination in 28, an infected food handler in 11, and other faults in 14. outbreaks associated with catering on domestic premises were independently more likely than outbreaks in other settings to be associated with salmonellas, inappropriate storage of food, and consumption of poultry, eggs, or sauces. public health services need to direct messages about the use, preparation, and storage of food to those who cater on domestic premises.

TI  == detection of bacteria in equine synovial fluid by use of the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == equine synovial fluid aliquots were inoculated with salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli, actinobacillus equuli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus zooepidemicus to obtain approximate concentrations of 1000, 100, 10, and 1 colony forming u/ml. synovial fluid aliquots were also inoculated with an unquantitated  inoculum of bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens. inoculated synovial fluid was incubated in trypticase-soy broth or columbia broth for approximately 12 hours. then aliquots were removed for dna extraction and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis for detection of a 531 base-pair segment of bacterial dna corresponding to a region of the 16s ribosomal gene. duplicate samples of inoculated synovial fluid were prepared for microbial culture. bacteria were detected in all samples inoculated with bacteria but not in control synovial fluid samples. under experimental conditions there was no difference between microbial culture and pcr analyses for detection of bacteria. experimentally, pcr was able to detect bacteria in synovial fluid within 24 hours of inoculation.

TI  == seasonal variations in the isolation of salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, bacillus cereus and clostridium perfringens from environmental samples.
AB  == calf carcasses contaminated with s. typhimurium, b. cereus and cl. perfringens were placed in either a decomposition pit or in a deep burial pit. salmonella was isolated from the soil around the decomposition pit for 27 weeks and for 15 weeks around the burial site. salmonella re-appeared in soil samples during cold winter weather after an apparent 9-week absence from the decomposition pit and after 68  weeks in the burial site (a total of 88 weeks after the start of the experiment). there was also an annual rise in the isolation rate of b. cereus from the soil during the colder winter months, but cl. perfringens appeared to be more prevalent in samples taken during spring of the second year of the study. a similar apparent rise in the prevalence of s. enteritidis during a cold winter period occurred in an empty poultry house that had previously held a naturally infected broiler-breeder flock.

TI  == a complex array of hpr consensus dna recognition sequences proximal to the enterotoxin gene in clostridium perfringens type a.
AB  == enterotoxin production in clostridium perfringens is both strain dependent and sporulation associated. underlying these phenotypic observations must lie a genetic and molecular explanation and the principal keys will be held within the  dna sequence both upstream and downstream of the structural gene cpe. in accordance with the above we have sequenced 4.1 kbp of dna upstream of cpe in the type strain nctc 8239. a region of dna extending up to 1.5 kb 5' to cpe is conserved in all enterotoxin-positive strains. this region contains a putative orf with substantial homology to an orf in the salmonella typhimurium is200 insertion element and, in addition, contains multiple perfect consensus dna-binding sequences for the bacillus subtilis transition state regulator hpr. the detailed structural elements revealed by the sequence analysis are presented  and used to develop a new perspective on the molecular basis of enterotoxin production in this important food-poisoning bacterium.

TI  == increase of mannose residues, as salmonella typhimurium-adhering factor, on the cecal mucosa of germ-free chickens infected with eimeria tenella.
AB  == to study increase of the salmonella population in the cecum of chickens infected  with eimeria tenella, quantitative changes in mannose residues on the cecal mucosa were investigated. inhibition of s typhimurium adherence to the cecum by a 2% carbohydrate (d-mannose, d-galactose, l-fucose, alpha-methyl-d-glucoside) in phosphate-buffered saline solution was examined. only d-mannose had inhibitory effects. whereas, d-galactose had somewhat enhancing effects on adherence of s typhimurium to the cecal mucosa of uninfected germ-free chickens. in infected and uninfected chickens, d-mannose inhibited adherence of s typhimurium. d-mannose significantly (p < 0.05) increased adherence of bacteroides sp. in infected and uninfected chickens, d-mannose did not have any effect on adherence of clostridium perfringens and bifidobacterium thermophilum. under microscopic observation, only concanavalin a and lens culinaris agglutinin, of 8 lectins examined, were recognized as lectin-positive staining lines or spots in the cecal mucosa, indicating presence of mannose residues on the cecal mucosa. in e tenella-infected chickens, lectin-positive staining was seen strongly on the coarse surface of damaged cells and at the bottom of the crypts. these results indicate that coccidial infection may induce increase of mannose residues on the  intestinal surface and allow adhesion of more salmonellae to the intestine.

TI  == cloning, sequencing and distribution of the salmonella typhimurium lt2 sialidase  gene, nanh, provides evidence for interspecies gene transfer.
AB  == the salmonella typhimurium lt2 sialidase (neuraminidase, ec 3.2.1.18) structural  gene, nanh, has been cloned and sialidase overproduced from multicopy plasmids in escherichia coli. sialidase expression was regulated positively by camp. in contrast, certain tn1000 insertions located upstream of nanh coding sequences reduced sialidase activity. a nanh chromosomal insertion mutation constructed by  marker exchange demonstrated a single sialidase gene copy in s. typhimurium lt2.  the complete nucleotide sequence of nanh, encoding a 41,300 dalton polypeptide, was determined and the derived primary structure was similar to sialidases from clostridium perfringens, clostridium sordellii, bacteroides fragilis, and trypanosoma cruzi. comparative sequence analysis, including codon usage and secondary structure predictions, indicated that the s. typhimurium and clostridial sialidases are homologous, strongly suggestive of an interspecies gene transfer event. at least two primary sequence motifs of the bacterial enzymes were detected in influenza a virus sialidases. the predicted secondary structure of the bacterial enzymes was strikingly similar to viral sialidase. from the population distribution of nanh detected within a collection of salmonellae, it was apparent that s. typhimurium obtained its nanh copy most recently from salmonella arizonae. s. typhimurium lt2 is thus a genetic mosaic that differs from other strains of even the same serotype by nanh plus potentially additional characters linked to nanh. these results have relevance to the evolution and function of sialidases in pathogenic microbes, and to the origin of the sialic acids.

TI  == adhesion of bacteria to the cecal mucosal surface of conventional and germ-free chickens infected with eimeria tenella.
AB  == when salmonella typhimurium and clostridium perfringens were tested in conventional chickens, larger numbers of s typhimurium and c perfringens adhered  to eimeria tenella-infected ceca than to uninfected ceca. in germ-free chickens,  s typhimurium and c perfringens adhered to the e tenella-infected cecal mucosa more than to the uninfected cecal mucosa, but fewer bacteroides vulgatus and bifidobacterium thermophilum adhered to the e tenella-infected ceca than to the uninfected ceca. many bacteria adhered to the lesions caused by e tenella as observed by scanning electron microscopy. on the basis of our findings, we suggest that infection with e tenella upsets the balance of competitive adherence of bacteria, allowing more colonization of s typhimurium and c perfringens.

TI  == inhibition of clostridium tyrobutyricum by bacteriocin-like substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were selected for their inhibitory activity against clostridium tyrobutyricum under conditions that eliminate the effects of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide. four strains were isolated belonging to the species lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. the sensitivity of the inhibitory substances to pronase and trypsine indicates that they are proteins or peptides different from  nisin. their resistance to phospholipase d indicates that they are also different from lactostrepcin. the inhibitory substances are produced during the exponential phase of growth. their activity is bactericidal and directed toward some strains  of clostridium tyrobutyricum, lactobacillus helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus, but strains used as dairy starters, lactobacillus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, and propionibacterium shermanii, are not all affected by the inhibition.

TI  == population of salmonella typhimurium in the cecum of gnotobiotic chickens.
AB  == to test the interaction of various species of bacteria with salmonella typhimurium, levels of s. typhimurium were measured in the cecum of gnotobiotic chickens inoculated with various test bacteria and subsequently with s. typhimurium. the population of s. typhimurium was suppressed in the cecum of chickens previously inoculated with escherichia coli. populations of bacteroides  vulgatus, clostridium perfringens, bifidobacterium thermophilum, or lactobacillus acidophilus were transiently, though not significantly, suppressed by s. typhimurium. inoculation of chickens with c. perfringens caused a terminal increase in the population of s. typhimurium. thus the effect of cecal contents on reducing the levels of s. typhimurium in the cecum may be due to the presence  of e. coli in the cecal contents.

AB  == the genes of the bacterial sialidases from clostridium sordellii g12, c. perfringens a99, salmonella typhimurium lt-2 and vibrio cholerae 395 sequenced so far were examined for homologies and were compared with sequences of viral sialidases. each of the bacterial sialidases contains a short sequence of twelve  amino-acids, which is repeated at four positions in the protein. all these sequences exhibit significant similarities. comparing the repeated sequences of the four sialidases, five amino-acids were found to be highly conserved at defined positions: ser-x-asp-x-gly-x-thr-trp. additionally, most of the distances between the four repeated regions are also conserved among the different sialidases. the conserved bacterial sequences show similarity with sialidases of  influenza a h7n1 and h13n9.

TI  == survival of bacteria in carcasses.
AB  == bacteria injected into the bloodstream of guinea pigs shortly before death decreased in number in carcass tissues for about 1 h after death. if initial bacterial numbers were sufficiently low, all bacteria were eliminated, and carcass tissues were sterile 24 h after death. carcass tissue sterility was maintained with an initial density of clostridium perfringens or salmonella typhimurium of 20 cells per g or with an initial density of the other species examined of several hundred cells per gram. with larger numbers of strict and facultative anaerobes, growth commenced after 3 h in carcasses incubated at 30 degrees c. spores of c. perfringens were killed over the same period as vegetative cells, but growth did not commence until 8 h after death. bactericidal activity in carcass tissues must therefore be taken into account in evaluating the significance of reports of deep-tissue contamination of carcasses from meat animals.

TI  == effect of delayed evisceration on the microbial quality of meat.
AB  == the postomortem invasion of muscle and other tissues by bacteria from the intestinal tract was studied with the use of radioactive tracers. the injection of 14c-labeled bacteria or spores into the intestines of guinea pig carcasses within 24 h of death resulted in the rapid spread of 14c throughout carcasses. when live bacteria were injected along with the labeled cells, it was not possible to isolate viable organisms from the body tissues if the living animal had been exposed to the bacteria. it appears that animals are immune to their normal intestinal flora and that this immunity persists after death; thus passage of these bacteria into the lymphatic system does not necessarily result in the presence of live bacteria in carcass tissues. it therefore seems that a delay of  up to 24 h before evisceration would not lead to deep tissue contamination of the carcass by organisms usually present in the intestines. further evidence for this hypothesis was obtained by showing that muscle and lymph nodes from uneviscerated lamb carcasses hung for 24 h at 20 c remained sterile.

TI  == effect of klebsiella pneumoniae enterotoxin on intestinal transport in the rat.
AB  == the effects on intestinal transport of either a semipurified preparation of enterotoxin elaborated by klebsiella pneumoniae or similaryly prepared control material were tested by marker perfusion studies in the small intestine of rats.  at a concentration of 2 mg/ml, the enterotoxin produced net secretion of water, na, and cl in both jejunal and ileal segments; hco3 transport was not affected. net secretion was evident within 30 min after intorduction of the toxin and was maximal after 90 min. the addition of 56 mm glucose to the enterotoxin-containing perfusion fluid resulted in reversal of water and na transport to net absorption  in both intestinal segments. the enterotoxin also produced a significant depression of xylose absorption in both the jejunum and ileum but did not affect  the absorption of either glucose or l-leucine. intestinal structure was not altered after perfusion of the toxin but insillation of approximately one-quarter of the total perfusion dose into a ligated jejunal loop for 18 h produced fluid secretion and structural abnormalities. these observations confirm the fact that  other species of coliform bacteria in addition to tescherichia coli are capable of elaborating an enterotoxin. such species commonly contaminate the small intestine of persons with tropical sprue and it is suggested that chronic exposure of the intestinal mucosa to the enterotoxin elaborated by these bacteria may be a factor in the pathogenesis of intestinal abnormalities in thid disorder.
