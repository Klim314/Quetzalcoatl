TI  == isolation and characterization of lactic acid bacteria from pobuzihi (fermented cummingcordia), a traditional fermented food in taiwan.
AB  == lactobacillus pobuzihii is a novel species which has been previously found in pobuzihi (fermented cummingcordia), a traditional fermented food in taiwan. however, the lactic acid bacteria (lab) microflora in pobuzihi has not been studied in detail. in this study, lab from pobuzihi were isolated, identified, and characterized. a total of 196 lab were isolated; 79 cultures were isolated from the sample collected from a manufacturing factory, 38 from pobuzihi samples  collected from 4 different markets, and 79 from 2 fresh cummingcordia samples. these isolates were characterized phenotypically and then divided into eight groups (a to h) by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing of 16s ribosomal dna. lactobacillus plantarum was the most abundant lab found in most samples during the fermentation of pobuzihi. on the other hand, enterococcus casseliflavus and weissella cibaria were, respectively, the major species found in the two fresh cummingcordia samples. a potential novel species or subspecies of lactococcal strain was found. in addition, seven l. plantarum and five w. cibaria strains showed inhibitory activity against the indicator strain lactobacillus sakei jcm 1157(t). this is the first report describing the distribution and varieties of lab existing in the pobuzihi during its fermentation process and the final product on the market.

TI  == isolation and characterisation of lactic acid bacteria from jiang-gua (fermented  cucumbers), a traditional fermented food in taiwan.
AB  == background: jiang-gua (fermented cucumbers) is a popular traditional fermented food in taiwan. the microflora of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in jiang-gua have not been investigated in detail. in this study, lab from jiang-gua were isolated, characterised and identified. results: a total of 103 lab were isolated; 70 cultures were isolated from jiang-gua samples and 33 cultures were isolated from  its raw substrate, cucumber. these isolates were mainly characterised phenotypically and then divided into seven groups (a-g) by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing of 16s ribosomal dna. the isolates were identified as enterococcus casseliflavus, leuconostoc lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paraplantarum, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, weissella cibaria and weissella  hellenica. the antibacterial activities of the isolates were determined and 11 lc. lactis subsp. lactis strains showed inhibitory activity against the indicator strain lactobacillus sakei jcm 1157(t) . conclusion: heterofermentative w. cibaria and leu. lactis were the major lab found in jiang-gua samples without soy sauce. in soy sauce-added samples, homofermentative l. pentosus and l. plantarum  were the most abundant lab. in addition, the results also suggested that hhai and rsai restriction enzymes could be applied to distinguish w. hellenica and weissella paramesenteroides.

TI  == probiotic table olives: microbial populations adhering on olive surface in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in an industrial plant.
AB  == this study reports the dynamics of microbial populations adhering on the surface  of debittered green olives cv. bella di cerignola in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in different brining conditions (4% and 8% (w/v) nacl) at room temperature and 4 degrees c. the probiotic strain successfully colonized the olive surface dominating the natural  lab population and decreasing the ph of brines to <or=5.0 after 30 days until the end of fermentation. the dynamics of microbial populations associated with olive  surface and belonging to the different groups indicated that inoculated olives held at room temperature did not host enterobacteriaceae at the end of fermentation. yeast populations were present in a low number (<or=log(10) 5.7 cfu/g) throughout the process. a considerable genetic diversity of lab species colonizing the olive surface was found mainly in inoculated set brined in 8% nacl, as indicated by the shannon diversity index calculated for each set. generally, strains of lactobacillus coryniformis, l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l.  pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. brevis, l. mali, l. vaccinostercus, l.casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuc. pseudomesenteroides, lactococcus lactis, weissella paramesenteroides, w. cibaria, enterococcus casseliflavus group and e.  italicus were identified during the whole process. in particular, l. pentosus was the most frequently isolated species and it showed a high strain diversity throughout fermentation in all processes except for the one held at 4 degrees c.  also a notable incidence of leuc. mesenteroides on olives was highlighted in this study during all fermentation. results indicated that the human strain l. paracasei impc2.1 can be considered an example of a strain used in the dual role  of starter and probiotic culture which allowed the control of fermentation processes and the realization of a final probiotic product with functional appeal.

TI  == genotypic diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from african traditional alkaline-fermented foods.
AB  == aim: to identify and compare lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from alkaline fermentations of cassava (manihot esculenta crantz) leaves, roselle (hibiscus sabdariffa) and african locust bean (parkia biglobosa) seeds for production of, respectively, ntoba mbodi, bikalga and soumbala. methods and results: a total of  121 lab were isolated, identified and compared by phenotyping and genotyping using pcr amplification of 16s-23s rdna intergenic transcribed spacer (its-pcr),  repetitive sequence-based pcr (rep-pcr) and dna sequencing. the results revealed  a diversity of genera, species and subspecies of lab in african alkaline fermentations. the isolates were characterized as nonmotile (in most cases) gram-positive rods, cocci or coccobacilli, catalase and oxidase negative. its-pcr allowed typing mainly at species level, with differentiation of a few bacteria at subspecies level. rep-pcr permitted typing at subspecies level and revealed significant genotypic differences between the same species of bacteria from different raw materials. dna sequencing combined with use of api 50chl and api 20strep systems allowed identification of bacteria as weissella confusa, weissella cibaria, lactobacillus plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus avium and enterococcus hirae from ntoba mbodi; ent. faecium, ent. hirae and pediococcus acidilactici from bikalga and soumbala. conclusion: lab found in african alkaline-fermented foods belong to a range of genera, species and subspecies of bacteria and vary considerably according to raw material. significance and impact of the study: our study confirms that lab survive in alkaline fermentations, a first crucial stage in determining their significance and possible value as probiotic bacteria.
