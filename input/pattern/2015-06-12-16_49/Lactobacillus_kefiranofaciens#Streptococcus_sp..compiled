TI  - Bacteria and yeast microbiota in milk kefir grains from different Italian regions.
AB  - Kefir grains are a unique symbiotic association of different microrganisms, mainly lactic acid bacteria, yeasts and occasionally acetic acid bacteria, cohabiting in a natural polysaccharide and a protein matrix. The microbial composition of kefir grains can be considered as extremely variable since it is strongly influenced by the geographical origin of the grains and by the sub-culturing method used. The aim of this study was to elucidate the bacteria and yeast species occurring in milk kefir grains collected in some Italian regions by combining the results of scanning electron microscopy analysis, viable counts on selective culture media, PCR-DGGE and pyrosequencing. The main bacterial species found was Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens while Dekkera anomala was the predominant yeast. The presence of sub-dominant species ascribed to Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis and Acetobacter genera was also highlighted. In addition, Lc. lactis, Enterococcus sp., Bacillus sp., Acetobacter fabarum, Acetobacter lovaniensis and Acetobacter orientalis were identified as part of the cultivable community. This work further confirms both the importance of combining culture-independent and culture-dependent approaches to study microbial diversity in food and how the combination of multiple 16S rRNA gene targets strengthens taxonomic identification using sequence-based identification approaches.
TI  - Pyrosequencing analysis of the microbial diversity of airag, khoormog and tarag,  traditional fermented dairy products of mongolia.
AB  - Here, we used pyrosequencing to obtain a detailed analysis of the microbial diversities of traditional fermented dairy products of Mongolia. From 22 Airag (fermented mare's milk), 5 Khoormog (fermented camel's milk) and 26 Tarag (fermented milk of cows, goats and yaks) samples collected in the Mongolian provinces of Arhangai, Bulgan, Dundgobi, Tov, Uburhangai and Umnugobi, we obtained a total of 81 operational taxonomic units, which were assigned to 15 families, 21 genera and 41 species in 3 phyla. The genus Lactobacillus is a core bacterial component of Mongolian fermented milks, and Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens and Lactobacillus delbrueckii were the predominant species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the Airag, Khoormog and Tarag samples, respectively. By using this pyrosequencing approach, we successfully detected most LAB species that have been isolated as well as seven LAB species that have not been found in our previous culture-based study. A subsequent analysis of the principal components of the samples revealed that L. delbrueckii, L. helveticus, L. kefiranofaciens and Streptococcus thermophilus were the main factors influencing the microbial diversity of these Mongolian traditional fermented dairy products and that this diversity correlated with the animal species from which the milk was sourced.
TI  - Characterization of new exopolysaccharides produced by coculturing of L. kefiranofaciens with yoghurt strains.
AB  - This project was designed to study the coculturing affect of exopolysaccharide (EPS) producing strains Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens (L.k) ZW3, with non EPS producing strains L. bulgaricus (L.b) and Streptococcus thermophilus (S.t) in three different combinations: L.k+L.b, L.k+S.t, and L.k+L.b+S.t. FTIR analysis revealed presence of strong stretch in regions of 3400, 2900 and 1647cm(-1) which is characteristic of a typical polysaccharide. Co-cultured EPSs were composed of glucose, galactose, arabinose and xylose; and their sugar compositions were different from ZW3 polysaccharide that was mainly composed of gluco-galactan. Peak temperature for L.k+L.b, L.k+S.t, L.k+S.t+L.b and ZW3 polymers were 90.59, 87.61, 95.18 and 97.38 degrees C, respectively. Thermal analysis revealed degradation temperature of 326.44, 294.6, 296.7 and 299.62 degrees C for L.k+L.b, L.k+S.t, L.k+S.t+L.b and ZW3 polymers, respectively. SEM and AFM analysis divulged that three cocultured EPSs had different surface morphology than ZW3 polymer. Since co-cultured polymers have different structure than the polymer produced exclusively by EPS producing strain, it can be safely concluded from the study that co-culturing can be one way to change the structure of polymers. Coculturing of L. kefiranofaciens with non-EPS producing strains resulted in yoghurt with increased viscosity and delayed syneresis.
TI  - Assessment of the microbial diversity of Brazilian kefir grains by PCR-DGGE and pyrosequencing analysis.
AB  - The microbial diversity and community structure of three different kefir grains from different parts of Brazil were examined via the combination of two culture-independent methods: PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and pyrosequencing. PCR-DGGE showed Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens and Lactobacillus kefiri to be the major bacterial populations in all three grains. The yeast community was dominated by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Pyrosequencing produced a total of 14,314 partial 16S rDNA sequence reads from the three grains. Sequence analysis grouped the reads into three phyla, of which Firmicutes was dominant. Members of the genus Lactobacillus were the most abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in all samples, accounting for up to 96% of the sequences. OTUs belonging to other lactic and acetic acid bacteria genera, such as Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Streptococcus and Acetobacter, were also identified at low levels. Two of the grains showed identical DGGE profiles and a similar number of OTUs, while the third sample showed the highest diversity by both techniques. Pyrosequencing allowed the identification of bacteria that were present in small numbers and rarely associated with the microbial community of this complex ecosystem.
TI  - Determination of lactic microflora of kefir grains and kefir beverage by using culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  - In this study, we investigated the bacterial compositions of kefir grains and kefir beverages collected from different regions of Turkey by using culture-independent and culture-dependent methods. In the culture-independent detection, 10 different species of bacteria were detected in total by using the polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis of the 16S rRNA gene V3 region. Among these species, Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens was the most dominant one in the kefir grains, while Lactococcus lactis was found to be significantly prevalent in the kefir beverages. In the culture-dependent detection, the primary differentiation and grouping of the isolates from kefir beverages and kefir grains were performed using repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) fingerprinting, and the results were validated by 16S rDNA full-length sequencing. According to the results of culture-dependent methods, the most frequently isolated species were L. lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Lactobacillus kefiri, respectively. Only 3 species, which are L. lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Streptococcus thermophilus, were detected with both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. This study showed that the combination of both methods is necessary for a detailed and reliable investigation of microbial communities in kefir grains and kefir beverages. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Due to their artisan- and region-dependent microflora, kefir products can be a source of interesting lactic acid bacteria, either new taxa or strains with specific functional properties, which might be used for the development of new starter cultures and innovative food products. Therefore, an increasing demand exists for new strains that show desirable effects on the product characteristics Artisan dairy products are a candidate source of such microorganisms. For this reason, in this study, the bacterial compositions of kefir grains and kefir beverages obtained from different regions of Turkey were studied using culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular methods.
TI  - Identification of the bacterial biodiversity in koumiss by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and species-specific polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Bacterial biodiversity in traditional koumiss fermented milk was studied by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Target DNA bands were identified according to the reference species ladder, constructed in this study. Comigrating bands present in the DGGE profiles were resolved by species-specific PCR. The results revealed a novel bacterial profile and extensive bacterial biodiversity in koumiss. The dominant lactic acid bacteria included Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens. Frequently encountered bacterial species were Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus kitasatonis, and Lactobacillus kefiri. Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus buchneri, and Lactobacillus jensenii were occasionally found in this product. In addition, L. buchneri, L. jensenii, and L. kitasatonis, which were never previously isolated by culture-dependent methods, were identified for the first time in the Xinjiang koumiss. Furthermore, conventional cultivation was performed by plating samples on M17, de Man-Rogosa-Sharpe, Halligan-Pearce, and Kenner fecal media. The results revealed that lactobacilli were the dominant species in the koumiss ecosystem, which was consistent with the results obtained by the DGGE analysis. This is the first systematic study of the microbial composition in koumiss, and our findings will be helpful in selecting appropriate strains for the manufacture of this product at the industrial level.
