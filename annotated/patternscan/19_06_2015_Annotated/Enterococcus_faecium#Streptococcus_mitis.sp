TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal travnik young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks over four seasons.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the composition of lactic acid bacteria  (lab) in autochthonous young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks produced in  the vlasic mountain region of central bosnia and herzegovina near the town of travnik over a four season period. these three products were made from cow's milk by a traditional method without the addition of a starter culture. preliminary characterization with phenotype-based assays and identification using rep-pcr with a (gtg)5 primer and 16s rdna sequence analysis were undertaken for 460 lab isolates obtained from all the examined samples. fifteen species were identified  as follows: lactococcus lactis, lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus garviae, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus helveticus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus italicus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus thermophilus and streptococcus mitis. a wide genotypic and  phenotypic heterogeneity of the species was observed, particularly within the lc. lactis strains. in all of the tested dairy products across four seasons, a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.690) between the presence of lactococci and enterococci and a negative correlation (r = 0.722) between the presence of lactococci and leuconostocs were recorded. forty-five percent of the lactobacilli and 54.4% of the lactococci exhibited proteolytic activity, whereas 18.7% of the  total lab isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity.

TI  == rapid detection of gram-positive organisms by use of the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the bact/alert pediatric fan system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  == assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. we evaluated the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp) in two pediatric hospitals. positive bact/alert pediatric fan blood cultures with gram-positive organisms were tested using the bc-gp in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. to test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles  were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 cfu  per milliliter. a total of 249 gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%,  respectively. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis  with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. the  bc-gp correctly identified 14/15 cases of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus  faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae. it misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with streptococcus anginosus group as s. pneumoniae. the bc-gp detected a case of streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus agalactiae. bc-gp's rapid accurate detection of staphylococcus spp., e. faecium, and e. faecalis and its ability to  ascertain meca, vana, and vanb status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining  to optimal antibiotic use. false-positive s. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the bc-gp.

TI  == streptococcus
AB  == the genus streptococcus , a heterogeneous group of gram-positive bacteria, has broad significance in medicine and industry. various streptococci are important ecologically as part of the normal microbial flora of animals and humans; some can also cause diseases that range from subacute to acute or even chronic. among  the significant human diseases attributable to streptococci are scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, glomerulonephritis, and pneumococcal pneumonia. streptococci are essential in industrial and dairy processes and as indicators of pollution. the nomenclature for streptococci, especially the nomenclature in medical use, has been based largely on serogroup identification of cell wall components rather than on species names. for several decades, interest has focused on two major species that cause severe infections: s pyogenes (group a streptococci) and s pneumoniae (pneumococci). in 1984, two members were assigned  a new genus - the group d enterococcal species (which account for 98% of human enterococcal infections) became enterococcus faecalis (the majority of human clinical isolates) and e faecium (associated with a remarkable capacity for antibiotic resistance). in recent years, increasing attention has been given to other streptococcal species, partly because innovations in serogrouping methods have led to advances in understanding the pathogenetic and epidemiologic significance of these species. a variety of cell-associated and extracellular products are produced by streptococci, but their cause-effect relationship with pathogenesis has not been defined. some of the other medically important streptococci are s agalactiae (group b), an etiologic agent of neonatal disease;  e faecalis (group d), a major cause of endocarditis, and the viridans streptococci. particularly for the viridans streptococci, taxonomy and nomenclature are not yet fully reliable or consistent. important members of the viridans streptococci, normal commensals, include s mutans and s sanguis (involved in dental caries), s mitis (associated with bacteremia, meningitis, periodontal disease and pneumonia), and "s milleri" (associated with suppurative  infections in children and adults). there remains persistent taxonomic confusion  regarding "s milleri." these and other streptococci of medical importance are listed intable 13-1by serogroup designation, normal ecologic niche, and associated disease.

TI  == prevalence of resistance phenotypes and genotypes to macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin antibiotics in gram-positive cocci isolated in tunisian bone marrow transplant center.
AB  == to investigate the prevalence of resistance to macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin (mls) antibiotics in gram-positive cocci isolated in a bone marrow  transplant center of tunisia, we tested the antibiotic susceptibility of 172 clinical isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis and enterococcus faecium to macrolide erythromycin and spiramycin, the lincosamide clindamycin and the streptogramin pristinamycin. these three groups of organisms  were mostly resistant to macrolides and lincosamide, but were commonly susceptible to pristinamycin. the resistance phenotypes of erythromycin-resistant isolates were determined by the five-disc test with erythromycin, spiramycin, lincomycin, clindamycin and pristinamycin, which showed that most exhibited constitutive mls resistance. in order to determine the prevalence of the resistance genotypes and the resistance mechanisms, the prevalence of the erythromycin resistance methylase (erm) (a), erm(b), erm(c), msr(a) and macrolide efflux (mef) (a) genes in the erythromycin-resistant isolates was identified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis. the resistance was due mainly to the presence of ermb in e. faecium (80%), ermc in s. epidermidis (53%) and mefa in s. mitis (65%).

TI  == fluorescence in situ hybridisation (fish) accelerates identification of gram-positive cocci in positive blood cultures.
AB  == sepsis is a life-threatening disease with a high mortality rate. rapid identification of blood culture isolates plays a crucial role in adequate antimicrobial therapy in sepsis patients. to accelerate microbiological diagnosis, a comprehensive panel of oligonucleotide probes for fluorescence in situ hybridisation (fish) targeting gram-positive cocci was compiled and evaluated on 428 positive blood culture specimens. by combining genus-specific and species-specific probes, the assay allowed discrimination of staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci as well as differentiation of therapy-relevant pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium/durans. furthermore, the newly designed fish probes strep2, enco and granu targeted streptococcus pneumoniae/mitis, enterococcus spp. (except e. faecalis) and granulicatella adiacens group, respectively. the fish assay achieved an overall sensitivity of 98.65% and a specificity of 99.0% and therefore allowed rapid and  reliable molecular identification of gram-positive cocci in blood culture specimens.

TI  == use of the phoenix automated system for identification of streptococcus and enterococcus spp.
AB  == the phoenix system (becton dickinson diagnostic systems, sparks, md) was evaluated for identification (id) to the species level of streptococci and enterococci. two hundred clinical isolates were investigated: beta-hemolytic streptococci (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae organisms (n = 46), viridans group streptococci (n = 31), enterococcus faecium (n = 36), enterococcus faecalis (n = 25), and other catalase-negative cocci (n = 12). the api system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) was used as a comparator. molecular methods (sequencing of 16s rrna and zwf and gki genes and ddl gene amplification) were used to investigate discordant results. upon resolution of discrepancies, correct species id was achieved by the phoenix system for 121/129 (93.8%) streptococci and 63/70  (90.0%) enterococci. excellent results were obtained for s. pneumoniae (45/45) and beta-hemolytic streptococci (49/50). with regard to viridans streptococci, the accuracy of the phoenix system was 83.9%. among the latter organisms, the best performance was obtained with isolates of the streptococcus sanguinis group  and streptococcus anginosus group; problems were instead encountered with the streptococcus mitis group. four e. faecium and three e. faecalis isolates were misidentified as enterococcus casseliflavus/enterococcus gallinarum or enterococcus durans. thus, these isolates were identified only at the genus level. compared with commercially available systems, the phoenix system appears a reliable diagnostic tool for identifying clinically relevant streptococci and enterococci. the smic/id-2 panel proved particularly effective for beta-hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci.

TI  == alkali-resistant bacteria in root canal systems.
AB  == the aim of this study was to isolate and identify alkali-resistant bacteria from  the dentin of infected root canals. bacteria from homogenized dentin powder made  up from infected root canal walls from human teeth were cultured on buffer-enriched brain heart infusion agar supplemented with 4% sheep blood (bhi-blood agar), adjusted to ph 7.0, 9.0 or 10.0. incubation took place for 7 days at 37 degrees c in an anaerobic glove box. bacterial strains selected according to colony and morphology were subcultured in buffer-enriched bhi broth  adjusted to ph 9.0, 10.0 or 11.0 to confirm their growth as alkali-resistant bacteria. polymerase chain reaction amplification using specific primer sets and  16s rdna sequence analysis was performed for identification of alkali-resistant isolates. in the present study, 37 teeth extracted from 37 patients were used for preparation of the dentin powder samples. bacteria were detected in 25 samples when standard bhi-blood agars (ph 7.0) were used. of these, 29 strains from 15 samples were alkali resistant, 25 strains growing at ph 9.0 and 4 at ph 10.0. the alkali-resistant strains included enterococcus faecium (10 strains) and enterococcus faecalis (2 strains), enterobacter cancerogenus (1 strains), fusobacterium nucleatum (1 strains), klebsiella ornithinolytica (2 strains), lactobacillus rhamnosus (2 strains), streptococcus anginosus (2 strains), streptococcus constellatus (3 strains), and streptococcus mitis (2 strains). three strains were also identified as bacteria of genus firmicutes or staphylococcus at the genus level. the present study showed that many bacterial species in infected root canal dentin were alkali-resistant at ph 9.0 and/or ph 10.0, and belonged mainly to the genus enterococcus.

TI  == inhibition by yeast killer toxin-like antibodies of oral streptococci adhesion to tooth surfaces in an ex vivo model.
AB  == background: monoclonal (ktmab) and recombinant (ktscfv) anti-idiotypic antibodies, representing the internal image of a yeast killer toxin, proved to be microbicidal in vitro against important eukaryotic and prokaryotic pathogens such as candida albicans, pneumocystis carinii, mycobacterium tuberculosis, staphylococcus aureus, s. haemolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae, including multidrug-resistant strains. ktmab and ktscfv exerted a strong therapeutic effect in well-established animal models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis. streptococcus mutans is the most important etiologic agent of dental caries that might result from the metabolic end products of dental plaque. effective strategies to reduce the disease potential of dental plaque have considered the possibility of using antibiotics or antibodies against oral streptococci in general and s. mutans in particular. in this study, the activity of ktmab and ktscfv against s. mutans and the inhibition and reduction by ktmab of dental colonization by s. mutans and other oral streptococci in an ex vivo model of human teeth were investigated. materials and  methods: ktscfv and ktmab were used in a conventional colony forming unit (cfu) assay against a serotype c strain of s. mutans, and other oral streptococci (s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius). an ex vivo model of human teeth submerged in saliva was used to establish ktmab potential of inhibiting or reducing the adhesion to dental surfaces by s. mutans and other oral streptococci. results: ktmab and ktscfv kill in vitro s. mutans and other oral streptococci. ktmab inhibit colonization of dental surfaces by s. mutans and oral streptococci in the ex vivo model. conclusions: killer antibodies with antibiotic activity or their engineered derivatives may have a potential in the prevention of dental caries in vivo.

TI  == effect of medium composition on the susceptibility of oral streptococci to mercuric chloride.
AB  == although there is considerable interest in identifying mercury-resistant bacteria, no standardized assay exists for this purpose. in this study, the effect of the composition of the medium on the susceptibility of oral streptococci to hgcl(2) was investigated. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of hgcl(2) for 52 streptococcal strains and the reproducibility of mic values for hg-sensitive and hg-resistant strains was determined with 11 different media. addition of blood increased the mic values, and some media (tryptone soya  agar, with or without blood) could not discriminate between hg-sensitive and hg-resistant strains. the proportion of streptococci that appeared to be resistant to hg was very high (>70%) on some media (mitis-salivarius, tryptone soya, columbia), but not on others (mueller-hinton, brain heart infusion, isosensitest). the mics of the control strains varied considerably on different testing occasions for tryptone soya agar (with and without blood), isosensitest agar, and columbia agar (with blood). mueller-hinton (without blood) appeared to  be the most suitable medium for isolating hg-resistant oral streptococci.

TI  == [therapeutic impact of streptococcal and enterococcal bacteremia in hematology patients].
AB  == from january 1999 to may 2000 (17 months), 21 strains of streptococci and four strains of enterococci have been isolated from 74 blood cultures in 25 infectious episodes in hematologic patients. they concerned 21 patients, of 21 to 77 years old. these patients suffered from acute leukaemia (14 cases), chronic lymphoid leukaemia (two cases), non-hodgkin's lymphoma (two cases) or myeloma (three cases). seventeen patients displayed a single streptococcal or enterococcal episode, two had two episodes in the course of a single stay in the hospital, two others in the course of two different stays. during 16 episodes (64%), the bacteremia occurred within 15 days after the onset of neutropenia consecutive to  antimitotic chemotherapy, and in nine episodes (36%) it has occurred after a period exceeding 15 days. in six cases the patients had already received antibiotics with a large antibacterial activity (beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone and/or glycopeptide +/- aminoside) and in four cases a single antibiotic (synergistine or cotrimoxazole). most streptococci (20/21) were oral streptococci (ten streptococcus mitis, five s. oralis, two s. sanguis, three s. pneumoniae). a single strain of beta-hemolytic streptococci has been identified as s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. the enterococci were one strain of enterococcus  faecalis and three e. faecium. ten streptococci were susceptible to 0.25 mg/l of  penicillin g, ten were less susceptible (0.5 < or = mic < 32 mg/l), and a strain  was resistant (mic = 32 mg/l). eighteen strains were susceptible to amoxicillin and cefotaxime. for three strains, the mics of amoxicillin and cefotaxime (8-16 mg/l and 8-32 mg/l, respectively) were higher. levels of resistance of the enterococci to the beta-lactam (penicillin, amoxicillin, and piperacillin) were variable. all species were susceptible to glycopeptides. three patients were transferred in intensive care unit for respiratory distress or shock syndrome. their evolution has remained severe under antibiotherapy comprising beta-lactam or vancomycin associated with an aminoside. this results demonstrate the interest of species identification to adapt the antibiotic treatment and confirms the frequency of oral streptococci in severe bacteremia in neutropenic patients.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 gram-positive microorganisms. the mic(90) (mg/l) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus anginosus and actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for streptococcus sanguis and listeria monocytogenes, 2 for corynebacterium jekeium and bifidobacterium bivius. over 50% of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium,  quinolone-resistant staphylococci, nocardia steroides and clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/l moxifloxacin. moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against gram-positive bacilli.

TI  == detection of bacteraemia in patients with fever and neutropenia using 16s rrna gene amplification by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == episodes of fever and neutropenia are common complications of treatment for cancer. the use of prophylactic and early empirical antibiotics has reduced mortality but decreases the sensitivity of diagnostic tests based on culture. the aim of this study was to determine the potential of a broad diagnostic approach (eubacterial) based on 16s rrna gene amplification and sequencing to augment cultural methods of diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients with fever and neutropenia in a regional paediatric oncology centre. one hundred eleven patient-episodes of fever and neutropenia were evaluated during the study period, 17 of which were associated with positive blood cultures, as follows: staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 6 episodes), enterococcus faecium (n = 2), streptococcus sanguis (n = 3), streptococcus mitis (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), micrococcus spp. (n = 1), and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 1). eubacterial polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detected bacterial dna in nine of 11  blood culture-positive episodes for which a sample was available for pcr; the species identified by sequence analysis were identical to those derived from the  conventional identification of the cultured isolates. bacterial dna was detected  in 20 episodes (21 bacterial sequences) associated with negative blood cultures,  18 of which occurred in patients who were receiving antibiotics at the time of sample collection. the species presumptively identified by partial 16s rrna gene  sequencing were as follows: pseudomonas spp. (n = 6 episodes), acinetobacter spp. (n =5 ); escherichia spp. (n = 3); moraxella spp. (n = 3); staphylococcus spp. (n = 2); neisseria spp. (n = 1); and bacillus spp. (n = 1). the results of this study suggest that molecular techniques can augment cultural methods in the diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients who have been treated with antibiotics.

TI  == detection of the phosphorylcholine epitope in streptococci, haemophilus and pathogenic neisseriae by immunoblotting.
AB  == the phosphorylcholine (pc) determinant in streptococcus pneumoniae is known to be linked to the cell wall polysaccharides (c-ps) and to the lipoteichoic acid (lta) (forssman antigen) of the plasma membrane. western blotting with two pc specific  murine monoclonal antibodies (mabs) designated 145,f-2 (igm) and 147,a-1 (iga) showed a similar ladder-like pattern for all examined strains of s. pneumoniae and streptococcus mitis. purified antigens run in parallel indicated that this ladder pattern is due to the pc of lta. unlike other techniques, western blotting thus enables the identification of only one of the streptococcal structures carrying the pc epitope. gram-negative organisms were also examined, and six of 11 haemophilus influenzae strains reacted with the mabs. for this species, unlike the streptococci, only one fast moving band was detected. analyses by thin-layer  chromatography (tlc) detected the pc epitope in lipopolysaccharide (lps) fraction from h. influenzae. some strains of the neisseriaceae family were also positive by western blotting, but tlc and immunostaining did not detect the pc determinant in lps.

TI  == rapid identification of streptococcus and enterococcus species using diffuse reflectance-absorbance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and artificial neural networks.
AB  == diffuse reflectance-absorbance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ft-ir) was used to analyse 19 hospital isolates which had been identified by conventional means to one enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, streptococcus bovis, s. mitis, s. pneumoniae, or s. pyogenes. principal components analysis of the ft-ir spectra showed that this 'unsupervised' learning method failed to form six  separable clusters (one of each species) and thus could not be used to identify these bacteria base on their ft-ir spectra. by contrast, artificial neural networks (anns) could be trained by 'supervised' learning (using the back-propagation algorithm) with the principal components scores of derivatised spectra to recognise the strains from their ft-ir spectra. these results demonstrate that the combination of ft-ir and anns provides a rapid, novel and accurate bacterial identification technique.

AB  == tosufloxacin tosylate (tosu) and temafloxacin hydrochloride (tema) were tested in vitro against 248 clinical isolates of various species of streptococci recovered  in a hospital microbiology laboratory (bellevue regional teaching hospital). species included s. pneumoniae (n = 20), group a streptococci (n = 22), group b streptococci (n = 30), group g streptococci (n = 17), group d s. bovis (n = 19),  enterococcus faecium (n = 45), enterococcus faecalis (n = 28), s. sanguis (n = 21), s. milleri (n = 29) and s. mitis (n = 17). activities of each of the two study drugs were evaluated comparatively with two other fluoroquinolones, i.e., ciprofloxacin (cip) and pefloxacin (pef). activities of each of these four antibiotics, expressed as the mic 90%, varied as follows according to the species of streptococci: tosu, 0.25 to 1 mg/l, tema 0.5 to 2 mg/l, cip, 1 to 4 mg/l and pef 8 to 32 mgl. overall, tosu and tema exhibited the greatest activity of the various species. the size of the inoculum had no significant effect on mic values.

TI  == microbiologic characteristics of lactobacillus products used for colonization of  the vagina.
AB  == lactobacilli have long been considered to be the protective flora in the vagina.  women with vaginal infections have used various non-prescription products in an attempt to restore their normal vaginal flora. products that contain lactobacilli include dairy products (yogurt, acidophilus milk) and commercially available lactobacillus powders and tablets. recently, lactobacillus species that produce hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) have been associated with normal vaginal flora. in this  study, we compared 16 non-prescription products containing lactobacilli for h2o2  production, purity, and identifiable contaminants. all 16 products contained lactobacilli, of which ten (62%) produced h2o2. at least one contaminant was detected in 11 of 16 (69%) of the products: enterococcus faecium (ten), clostridium sporogenes (one), streptococcus mitis (one), and pseudomonas species  (one). although all of the products tested contained lactobacilli, only four of the products contained lactobacillus acidophilus. most of the lactobacilli-containing products currently available either do not contain the lactobacillus species advertised and/or contain other bacteria of questionable benefit. we conclude that commercially available products may not be appropriate  for recolonization of the vagina.

TI  == cell surface hydrophobicity of group d and viridans streptococci isolated from patients with septicaemia.
AB  == sixty-three strains of group d streptococci and viridans streptococci isolated from blood cultures during a two year period were typed to the species level with conventional biochemical tests and api strep. streptococcus faecalis was the most common species isolated followed by s. sanguis, s. mitis and s. constellatus (s.  milleri). one of the two isolates of s. faecium was a contamination. the reported increasing frequency of this organism and other group d and viridans streptococci as well as the association of s. bovis with malignant bowel disease indicate the  need for full identification of streptococcal isolates from blood cultures. pronounced surface hydrophobicity as measured with the salt aggregation test (sat) was expressed by 59/63 (94%) of the blood culture isolates whereas strains  isolated from commercial fermentation products and strains passaged several times were hydrophilic. in the presence of human serum albumin which binds to lipoteichoic acid only one strain decreased in surface hydrophobicity. the surface hydrophobicity of two strains even slightly increased indicating that lipoteichoic acid but marginally contributes to surface hydrophobicity of streptococcal cells from these species.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of streptococcus.
AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. the major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (s. faecalis, s. faecium, 's. avium' and a proposed new species 's. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (s. bovis, s. equinus, s. salivarius, 's. casseliflavus', s. mutans, s. raffinolactis and an unidentified oral group i); (c) lactic species group (s. lactis including s. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (s. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (s. mitis, s. sanguis, a proposed new species 's. oralis' and 's. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. equi, 's. equisimilis' including 's. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of lancefield group b strains of human origin);  (g) parapyogenic species group (s. uberis, 's. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of lancefield groups r, s and t). species of aerococcus, gemella, leuconostoc and pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.

TI  == membrane filter technique for enumeration of enterococci in marine waters.
AB  == a membrane filter procedure is described for the enumeration of enterococci in marine waters. the procedure utilizes a highly selective and somewhat differential primary isolation medium followed by an in situ substrate test for identifying colonies of those organisms capable of hydrolyzing esculin. the procedure (me) was evaluated with known streptococci strains and field samples with regard to its accuracy, sensitivity, selectivity, precision, and comparability to existing methods. essentially quantitative recovery was obtained with seawater-stressed cells of streptococcus faecalis and s. faecium. neither s. bovis, s. equinus, s. mitis, nor s. salivarius grew on the medium. the selectivity of the medium was such that a 10,000-fold reduction in background organisms was obtained relative to a medium which contained no inhibitors and was incubated at 35 c. about 90% of those typical colonies designated as enterococci  confirmed as such and about 12% of the colonies not so designated were, in fact,  identified as enterococci. plate to plate variability across samples approximated that expected by chance alone. verified recoveries of enterococci from natural samples by the me procedure, on the average, exceeded those by the kf method by one order of magnitude.
