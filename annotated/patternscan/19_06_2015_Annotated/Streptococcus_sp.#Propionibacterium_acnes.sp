TI  == the cultivable microbiota of primary and secondary infected root canals, their susceptibility to antibiotics and association with the signs and symptoms of infection.
AB  == aim: to examine the presence of microbial species in primary and secondary infections and identify the signs and symptoms associated with them. methodology: a total number of 37 root canals from 33 patients undergoing root canal treatment were selected. samples were taken using a sterile paper point following chemomechanical canal instrumentation. microbiological identification was performed by macromorphological, micromorphological, and commercial biochemical tests (atb system). the antibiotic susceptibility profile of isolated enterococcus, streptococcus and propionibacterium spp. was evaluated. results: a  total number of 54 species were isolated. the most common was e. faecalis followed by propionibacterium acnes and streptococcus spp. five multidrug-resistant enterococcal strains were isolated. however, resistance to linezolid or glycopeptides was not found. radiolucency was observed significantly more often in symptomatic infections (p=0.0061) caused by actinomyces spp. than in asymptomatic ones. conclusions: enterococci and streptococci were the most commonly isolated bacteria from root canals. the resistance of enterococci to many antimicrobials may pose a problem in their eradication. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == a derivative of the thiopeptide ge2270a highly selective against propionibacterium acnes.
AB  == a chemical derivative of the thiopeptide ge2270a, designated nai003, was found to possess a substantially reduced antibacterial spectrum in comparison to the parent compound, being active against just a few gram-positive bacteria. in particular, nai003 retained low mics against all tested isolates of propionibacterium acnes and, to a lesser extent, against enterococcus faecalis. furthermore, nai003 showed a time- and dose-dependent killing of both a clindamycin-resistant and a clindamycin-sensitive p. acnes isolate. gel-shift experiments indicated that, like the parent compound, nai003 retained the ability to bind to elongation factors (ef) tu derived from escherichia coli, e. faecalis  or p. acnes, albeit with reduced efficiency. in contrast, ef-tu's derived from the nai003-insenstitive staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes did not bind this compound. these results were confirmed by in vitro studies using a hybrid translation system, which indicated that nai003 can inhibit most efficiently protein synthesis driven by the p. acnes ef-tu. p. acnes mutants resistant to nai003 were isolated by direct plating. with one exception, all analyzed strains carried mutation in the tuf gene, encoding ef-tu. because of its selective effect on p. acnes in comparison to resident skin flora, nai003 represents a promising candidate for the topical treatment of acne, which has already completed a phase 1 clinical study.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and mechanism of action of a novel cationic alpha-helical  octadecapeptide derived from alpha-amylase of rice.
AB  == amyi-1-18, an octadecapeptide derived from alpha-amylase (amyi-1) of rice (oryza  sativa l. japonica), is a novel cationic alpha-helical antimicrobial peptide (amp) that contains two lysine and two arginine residues. the antimicrobial activity of amyi-1-18 against human pathogens was quantitatively evaluated using  a chemiluminescence method that measures atp derived from viable cells. of the ten kinds of human pathogens, amyi-1-18 exhibited antimicrobial activity against  nine. its 50% growth-inhibitory concentrations (ics50 ) against porphyromonas gingivalis, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, and streptococcus mutans were 13, 19, 50, 64, and 77 mum, respectively. amyi-1-18 had little or no hemolytic activity even at 500 mum, and showed negligible cytotoxicity up to 1200 mum. the degree of 3,3'-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide release from p. gingivalis cells induced by the addition of amyi-1-18 was significantly lower than that induced by the addition of melittin. flow cytometric analysis showed that the percentages of p. aeruginosa, s. mutans, and  c. albicans cells stained with propidium iodide (pi), a dna-intercalating dye, were 89%, 43%, and 3%, respectively, when amyi-1-18 was added at a concentration  equal to its 4xic50 . therefore, the antimicrobial activity of amyi-1-18 against  p. aeruginosa and s. mutans appears to be mainly attributable to its membrane-disrupting activity. in contrast, its antimicrobial activity against p.  gingivalis and c. albicans most likely depends upon interactions with intracellular targets other than their cell membranes. collectively, these results indicate that amyi-1-18 is useful as a safe and potent amp against the pathogens described above in many fields of healthcare.

TI  == synergistic effect of 2% chlorhexidine combined with proteolytic enzymes on biofilm disruption and killing.
AB  == aim: to investigate the dynamics of a disinfection regimen using 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase k in combination with 2% chlorhexidine (with or without ultrasonics) using a nutrient-stressed endodontic multispecies model biofilm. methodology: nutrient-stressed biofilms (propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus  epidermidis, actinomyces radicidentis, streptococcus mitis and enterococcus faecalis omgs 3202) were grown in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth. the treatment groups included 1% trypsin and 2% chlorhexidine (chx), 1% proteinase k and 2% chx (with and without ultrasonics). 2% chx was the positive control and untreated group, and sterile saline (with and without ultrasonics) was the negative control. the biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. results: the trypsin and chx group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective in reducing viable counts and the substratum coverage than those of all other groups (p < 0.05). the viable counts of the proteinase k and chx group used with (4.26 +/- 0.58 log10 cfu ml-1 ) or without ultrasonics (5.05 +/-  1.36 log10 cfu ml-1 ) were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) as compared with the  untreated control (7.67 +/- 0.84 log10 cfu ml-1 ) and saline groups used with (6.57 +/- 0.73 log10 cfu ml-1 ) and without ultrasonics (6.74 +/- 0.10 log10 cfu  ml-1 ). the chx group was less effective in biofilm disruption compared to when used in combination with trypsin and proteinase k. conclusion: the trypsin and chx group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective at reducing bacterial viable counts and disrupting biofilm.

TI  == microbial community in persistent apical periodontitis: a 16s rrna gene clone library analysis.
AB  == aim: to characterize the microbial composition of persistent periapical lesions of root filled teeth using a molecular genetics approach. methodology: apical lesion samples were collected from 12 patients (23-80 years old) who visited the  kyushu university hospital for apicectomy with persistent periapical lesions associated with root filled teeth. dna was directly extracted from each sample and the microbial composition was comprehensively analysed using clone library analysis of the 16s rrna gene. enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans and specific fima genotypes of porphyromonas gingivalis were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis with specific primers. results: bacteria were detected in all samples, and the dominant findings were p. gingivalis (19.9%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.2%) and propionibacterium acnes (9%). bacterial diversity was greater in symptomatic lesions than in asymptomatic ones. in addition, the following bacteria or bacterial combinations were characteristic to symptomatic lesions: prevotella spp., treponema spp., peptostreptococcaceae sp. hot-113, olsenella uli, slackia exigua, selemonas infelix, p. gingivalis with type iv fima, and a combination of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and peptostreptococcaceae sp. hot-113 and predominance of streptococcus spp. on the other hand, neither enterococcus faecalis nor c. albicans were detected in any of the samples. conclusion: whilst a diverse bacterial species were observed in the  persistent apical lesions, some characteristic patterns of bacterial community were found in the symptomatic lesions. the diverse variation of community indicates that bacterial combinations as a community may cause persistent inflammation in periapical tissues rather than specific bacterial species.

TI  == fusidic acid in skin infections and infected atopic eczema.
AB  == skin infections represent an important public health issue and cost-driver. additionally, chronic skin lesions are sometimes colonized by gram-negative species. topical therapies are a key component in the management of mild-to-moderate skin infections. in such cases, topical antibiotics may be preferable to systemic treatment, since they maximize the effective doses at the  site of infection while minimizing the systemic side effects of the drugs. however, the prevalence of resistant strains is steadily increasing and cases of  sensitization are not uncommon. as a consequence, the ideal topical antibiotic should be selective (thus, minimizing cross-resistance), have weak sensitization  potential, penetrate the skin efficiently, reach adequate local doses at the site of infection, and finally be available in different formulations matching patients' preferences and needs. fusidic acid (fa) is a selective antibiotic available in several topical formulations. pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies have shown that, contrary to other topical antibiotics such as gentamicin or mupirocin, fa reaches high antimicrobial concentration at deep skin layers after topical application either on intact or damaged epidermis. several randomized controlled trials demonstrated that fa, in its various topical formulations, is very effective in treating skin infections, given its high bactericidal activity against s. aureus (including strains resistant to penicillin, methicillin, ampicillin, cloxacillin), s. epidermidis, streptococcus  pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, corinebatteria, clostridia. additionally, fa presents a low risk of resistance even in methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, a common pathogen implied in the etiology of skin infections and infected atopic eczema. such feature makes fa particularly useful in the management of these medical conditions. finally, possibly due to its large steric effect, fa has proved a very low risk of contact sensitization. overall, data on  fa efficacy, safety, sensitization potential, resistance profile and spectrum selectivity make it a first-choice option in the treatment of primary and secondary skin infection.

TI  == enzymatic treatment of specimens before dna extraction directly influences molecular detection of infectious agents.
AB  == introduction: biological samples, pharmaceuticals or food contain proteins, lipids, polymers, ammoniums and macromolecules that alter the detection of infectious agents by dna amplification techniques (pcr). moreover the targeted dna has to be released from the complex cell walls and the compact nucleoprotein  matrixes and cleared from potential inhibitors. the goal of the present work was  to assess the efficiency of enzymatic pretreatments on infectious agents to make  dna available for further extraction and amplification. methods: staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, aspergillus niger and fusarium solani were mixed with an internal control virus and treated with: 1) proteinase k; 2) lyticase and 3) lyticase followed by proteinase k. dnas was manually extracted using the qiamp dna mini kit or the magna pure compact automate. dna extraction yields and the inhibitors were assessed with a phocid herpesvirus. bacterial detection was performed using taqman real-time pcr and yeasts and filamentous fungi with hrm (real-time pcr followed by high-resolution melting analysis). results: viral dna was released, extracted and detected using manual and automatic methods without pre enzymatic treatments. either the manual or the automatic dna extraction systems did not meet the sensitivity expectations if enzymatic treatments were not performed before: lyticase for fungi and proteinase k for bacteria. the addition of lyticase and proteinase k did not improve results. for fungi the detection after lyticase was higher than for proteinase k, for which melting analysis did not allow fungal specification. discussion: columns and magnetic beads allowed collecting dna and separate pcr inhibitors. detection rates cannot be related to dna-avidity of beads or to elution but to the lack of proteolysis.

TI  == infectious prosthetic hip joint loosening: bacterial species involved in its aetiology and their antibiotic resistance profiles against antibiotics recommended for the therapy of implant-associated infections.
AB  == reliable microbiological diagnosis along with surgery and prolonged antibiotic therapy are key elements in the management of prosthetic-joint infections (pjis). the purpose of this study was to characterize antibiotic resistance profiles of bacteria involved in the aetiology of pjis. a total of 33 bacterial isolates cultured from 31 patients undergoing exchange of total hip prostheses were analyzed. the diagnostic approach toward isolation of prosthesis- associated microorganisms included sonication of retrieved implants and conventional cultures of periprosthetic tissues and synovial fluid. the in vitro resistance profiles of bacterial isolates were determined in relation to antibiotics recommended for the therapy of pjis using the disc diffusion method, e-tests((r)) and broth microdilution system. coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) were predominant microorganisms followed by staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus mitis, and propionibacterium acnes. twenty out of 30 and 12 out of 30 staphylococcal isolates were methicillin- and multi-drug resistant,  respectively. only two isolates were rifampicinresistant. all staphylococci were  susceptible to glycopeptides and linezolid. this paper stresses the pathogenic role of staphylococci in patients suffering from implant loosening and reports high methicillin- and multidrug-resistance rates in these bacteria. hence, antimicrobial susceptibility tests of individual bacterial isolates must always be performed to guide selection of the optimal therapeutic option.

TI  == routine testing for anaerobic bacteria in cerebrospinal fluid cultures improves recovery of clinically significant pathogens.
AB  == in north america, the widespread use of vaccines targeting haemophilus influenzae type b and streptococcus pneumoniae have dramatically altered the epidemiology of bacterial meningitis, while the methodology for culturing cerebrospinal fluid (csf) specimens has remained largely unchanged. the aims of this study were 2-fold: to document the current epidemiology of bacterial meningitis at a tertiary care medical center and to assess the clinical utility of routinely querying for anaerobes in csf cultures. to that end, we assessed csf cultures submitted over a 2-year period. a brucella blood agar (bba) plate, incubated anaerobically for 5 days, was included in the culture procedure for all csf specimens during the second year of evaluation. in the pre- and postimplementation years, 2,353 and 2,302 csf specimens were cultured, with 49 and 99 patients having positive culture results, respectively. the clinical and laboratory data for patients with positive cultures were reviewed. anaerobic bacteria were isolated in the csf samples from 33 patients post-bba compared to two patients pre-bba (p = 0.01). the anaerobic isolates included bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (n = 1), propionibacterium species (n = 15), and propionibacterium acnes (n = 19) isolates; all of these isolates were recovered on the bba. eight of the 35 patients from whom anaerobic organisms were isolated  received antimicrobial therapy. although six of these patients had central nervous system hardware, two patients did not have a history of a neurosurgical procedure and had community-acquired anaerobic bacterial meningitis. this study demonstrates that the simple addition of an anaerobically incubated bba to the culture of csf specimens enhances the recovery of clinically significant anaerobic pathogens.

TI  == influence of different additives and their concentrations on corneal toxicity and antimicrobial effect of benzalkonium chloride.
AB  == purpose: the aim of this study was to examine the ophthalmic additives responsible for modulating acute corneal epithelial toxicity induced by benzalkonium chloride (bac) and investigate the ability of polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil 40 (hco-40) and polysorbate 80 (ps-80) to reduce the corneal toxicity and antimicrobial effects of bac. methods: cytotoxicity of the additives, which included glycerin, polyvinyl alcohol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and ps-80, on rabbit corneal epithelial cells was examined using the cell proliferation assay in the presence and absence of 0.02% bac. the  corneal transepithelial electrical resistance change after a 60-second exposure to hco-40 or ps-80 mixed with 0.02% bac was measured in living rabbits. corneal damage was examined using scanning electron microscopy. the antimicrobial activities of hco-40 and ps-80 with 0.02% bac against staphylococcus aureus, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and streptococcus pneumoniae were assessed. results: of all the tested additives, only ps-80 could prevent the bac-induced cytotoxicity. corneal epithelial barrier function disorder caused by 0.02% bac was significantly alleviated by either ps-80 or hco-40 in a concentration-dependent manner. scanning electron microscopy images showed an improvement of bac-induced corneal epithelial toxicity after the addition of hco-40 or ps-80. the antimicrobial effect of the bac against p. aeruginosa, e. coli, and s. pneumoniae was reduced after adding hco-40 or ps-80.  conclusions: hco-40 and ps-80 reduce acute corneal toxicity and the antimicrobial effect of bac. possible interactions between bac and other additives should be taken into consideration when evaluating the toxicity and antibacterial properties of bac.

TI  == bacteriological evaluation of tonsillar microbial flora according to age and tonsillar size in recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  == although numerous studies based on the bacteriology of the tonsil have been carried out, none of them analyzed the variation of tonsillar flora with respect  to both age and tonsillar size. the purpose of this study was to isolate the facultative and obligate anaerobes both from the surface and the core of tonsils  in recurrent tonsillitis as well as to analyze the variation of isolated bacterial strains according to age and tonsillar size. a prospective study was performed on 111 patients who underwent tonsillectomy. we analyzed the differences between the bacterial pathogens in recurrent tonsillitis and semi-growth estimates with regard to age and tonsillar grade. among 111 cases, 604 bacterial strains of 21 different from the tonsil superficial and core were isolated. the most common facultative anaerobic species isolated from the surface and core were coagulase-negative staphylococci, alpha-hemolytic streptococci and  diphtheroid bacilli in all subgroups except patients below 8 years old. the most  commonly obligate anaerobic species isolated from the core were propionibacterium acnes, prevotella melaninogenica and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. we found no significant difference in the cultured bacteria with respect to age and tonsillar size. the study subgroups did not differ in the occurrence of semiquantitative growth estimates of 3-4+. our study demonstrates that there is polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic flora in tonsils with regardless of patient's age and tonsillar size. this polymicrobial spectrum of bacteria may contribute to recurrence and to the failure of conservative treatment of these cases and therefore leads to surgical therapy.

TI  == 5alpha-androst-16-en-3alpha-ol beta-d-glucuronide, precursor of 5alpha-androst-16-en-3alpha-ol in human sweat.
AB  == 5alpha-androst-16-en-3alpha-ol (alpha-androstenol) is an important contributor to human axilla sweat odor. it is assumed that alpha-andostenol is excreted from the apocrine glands via a h2 o-soluble conjugate, and this precursor was formally characterized in this study for the first time in human sweat. the possible h2 o-soluble precursors, sulfate and glucuronide derivatives, were synthesized as analytical standards, i.e., alpha-androstenol, beta-androstenol sulfates, 5alpha-androsta-5,16-dien-3beta-ol (beta-androstadienol) sulfate, alpha-androstenol beta-glucuronide, alpha-androstenol alpha-glucuronide, beta-androstadienol beta-glucuronide, and alpha-androstenol beta-glucuronide furanose. the occurrence of alpha-androstenol beta-glucuronide was established by ultra performance liquid chromatography (uplc)/ms (heated electrospray ionization (hesi)) in negative-ion mode in pooled human sweat, containing eccrine and apocrine secretions and collected from 25 female and 24 male underarms. its concentration was of 79 ng/ml in female secretions and 241 ng/ml in male secretions. the release of alpha-androstenol was observed after incubation of the sterile human sweat or alpha-androstenol beta-glucuronide with a commercial glucuronidase enzyme, the urine-isolated bacteria streptococcus agalactiae, and the skin bacteria staphylococcus warneri dsm 20316, staphylococcus haemolyticus dsm 20263, and propionibacterium acnes atcc 6919, reported to have beta-glucuronidase activities. we demonstrated that if alpha- and beta-androstenols and androstadienol sulfates were present in human sweat, their  concentrations would be too low to be considered as potential precursors of malodors; therefore, the h2 o-soluble precursor of alpha-androstenol in apocrine  secretion should be a beta-glucuronide.

TI  == analysis of bacterial flora associated with peri-implantitis using obligate anaerobic culture technique and 16s rdna gene sequence.
AB  == purpose: to analyze and characterize the predominant bacterial flora associated with peri-implantitis by using culture techniques under obligate anaerobic conditions and 16s rdna gene sequences. materials and methods: subgingival bacterial specimens were taken from 30 patients: control (n = 15), consisting of  patients with only healthy implants; and test (n = 15), consisting of patients with peri-implantitis. in both groups, subgingival bacterial specimens were taken from the deepest sites. an anaerobic glove box system was used to cultivate bacterial strains. the bacterial strains were identified by 16s rdna genebased polymerase chain reaction and comparison of the gene sequences. results: peri-implantitis sites had approximately 10-fold higher mean colony forming units (per milliliter) than healthy implant sites. a total of 69 different bacterial species were identified in the peri-implantitis sites and 53 in the healthy implant sites. the predominant bacterial species in the peri-implantitis sites were eubacterium nodatum, e. brachy, e. saphenum, filifactor alocis, slackia exigua, parascardovia denticolens, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, centipeda periodontii, and parvimonas micra. the predominant bacteria in healthy implant sites apart from streptococcus were pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, veillonella species, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces species, propionibacterium acnes, and parvimonas micra. conclusion: these results suggest that the environment in the depths of the sulcus showing peri-implantitis is well suited for growth of obligate anaerobic bacteria. the present study demonstrated that the sulcus around oral implants with peri-implantitis harbors high levels of asaccharolytic anaerobic gram-positive rods (aagprs) such as e. nodatum, e. brachy, e. saphenum, filifactor alocis, slackia exigua, and gram-negative anaerobic rods, suggesting that conventional periodontopathic bacteria are not the only periodontal pathogens active in peri-implantitis, and that aagprs may also play an important role.

TI  == the effectiveness of enzymic irrigation in removing a nutrient-stressed endodontic multispecies biofilm.
AB  == aim: to establish a nutrient-stressed multispecies model biofilm and investigate  the dynamics of biofilm killing and disruption by 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase k  with or without ultrasonic activation. methodology: nutrient-stressed biofilms (propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis, actinomyces radicidentis, streptococcus mitis and enterococcus faecalis omgs 3202) were grown on hydroxyapatite discs and in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth in modified fluid universal medium. the treatment groups included trypsin, proteinase k, 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate and 1% sodium hypochlorite (naocl) (with and without ultrasonics). naocl and chlorhexidine were the positive controls and untreated group, and sterile saline was the negative control. the biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. results: nutrient stress in the multispecies biofilm was apparent as the medium ph became alkaline, glucose was absent, and serum proteins were degraded in the supernatant. the clsm showed the percentage reduction in viable bacteria at the biofilm surface level due to nutrient starvation. on the disc model, trypsin and proteinase k were effective in killing bacteria; their aerobic viable counts were significantly lower (p < 0.01) than the negative control and chlorhexidine. naocl was the most  effective agent (p < 0.001). in the tooth model, when compared to saline, trypsin with ultrasonics caused significant killing both aerobically and anaerobically (p < 0.05). chlorhexidine (1.46 +/- 0.42), trypsin (3.56 +/- 1.18) and proteinase k  (4.2 +/- 1.01) with ultrasonics were significantly effective (p < 0.05) in reducing the substratum coverage as compared to saline with ultrasonics (12% +/-  4.9). conclusion: trypsin with ultrasonic activation has a biofilm killing and disrupting potential.

TI  == effect of introduction of antibiotic-impregnated shunt catheters on cerebrospinal fluid shunt infection in children: a large single-center retrospective study.
AB  == object: infection after both primary and revision shunt surgeries remains a major problem in pediatric neurosurgical practice. antibiotic-impregnated shunt (ais) tubing has been proposed to reduce infection rates. the authors report their experience with ais catheters in their large pediatric neurosurgery department. methods: the authors conducted a retrospective case review of consecutive shunt operations performed before (1993-2003) and after (2005-2009) introduction of ais tubing, with analysis of shunt infection rates and causative organisms identified. results: the historical control group consisted of 1592 consecutive shunt operations (657 primary insertions), and the ais study group consisted of 500 consecutive shunt operations (184 primary insertions). patients ranged in age from 0-17 years. in the historical group, 135 infections were identified (8.4%).  in the ais study group, 25 infections were identified (5%), representing a significant reduction (p < 0.005). the latency to diagnosis of infection was 23 days in the historical group and 139 days in the ais study group. the infection rates in infants 0-6 months of age were 12.2% (historical group) and 6.7% (ais group, p < 0.005), and in infants 7-12 months of age the rates were 7.9% (historical group) and 2.7% (ais group, p < 0.005). in the historical control group, the frequency rank order of causative organisms was coagulase-negative staphylococcus (51.9%), staphylococcus aureus (31.6%), streptococcus or enterococcus spp. (8.8%), gram-negative organisms (4.4%), and propionibacterium acnes (2.2%). organisms responsible for infections in ais were s. aureus (40%), followed by streptococcus or enterococcus spp. (20%), p. acnes and coagulase-negative staphylococcus (both 16%), and gram-negative organisms (4%). no unusually antibiotic-resistant bacteria were identified in either group. the authors further subdivided the ais group into those undergoing primary ais insertion (subgroup 1), those undergoing revision of non-ais systems using ais components (subgroup 2), and those undergoing revision of ais systems using ais components (subgroup 3). infection rates were 1.6% in subgroup 1, 2.5% in subgroup 2, and 11.7% in subgroup 3. staphylococcus aureus was the most common organism identified in infections of the subgroups 2 and 3. conclusions: use of ais tubing significantly improves shunt infection rates in both general pediatric and infant populations with no evidence of increased antibiotic resistance, which is in agreement with previous studies. however, the increased infection rate in revision surgery in children with ais catheters in situ raises questions about their long-term application.

TI  == periprosthetic joint infections treated with two-stage revision over 14 years: an evolving microbiology profile.
AB  == late periprosthetic joint infection (pji) occurs in 0.3%-1.7% of total hip arthroplasties (thas) and 0.8%-1.9% of total knee arthroplasties (tkas). surgical debridement, explant, and appropriate antibiotics are imperative for successful treatment. we analyzed organisms from pjis at one institution for temporal trends over 14 years. poisson regression model demonstrated a linear increase in infection rate for the following bacteria as the primary organism: mrsa (incidence rate ratio [irr] = 1.11, p = 0.019), streptococcus viridans (irr = 1.18, p = 0.002), and propionibacterium acnes (irr = 1.21, p = 0.024). the increase in proportion of these organisms may warrant further discussion on pre-surgical mrsa screening and empiric therapy to include mrsa coverage, increased incubation time to detect p. acnes, and dental prophylaxis against s. viridans.

TI  == tunel analysis of dna fragmentation in mouse unfertilized oocytes: the effect of  microorganisms within human follicular fluid collected during ivf cycles.
AB  == recently we reported the presence of bacteria within follicular fluid. previous studies have reported that dna fragmentation in human spermatozoa after in vivo or in vitro incubation with bacteria results in early embryo demise and a reduced rate of ongoing pregnancy, but the effect of bacteria on oocytes is unknown. this study examined the dna within mouse oocytes after 12 hours' incubation within human follicular fluids (n=5), which were collected from women undergoing in vitro fertilization (ivf) treatment. each follicular fluid sample was cultured to detect the presence of bacteria. terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dutp nick-end labeling (tunel) was used to label dna fragmentation in ovulated, non-fertilized mouse oocytes following in vitro incubation in human follicular fluid. the bacteria streptococcus anginosus and peptoniphilus spp., lactobacillus gasseri (low-dose), l. gasseri (high-dose), enterococcus faecalis, or propionibacterium acnes were detected within the follicular fluids. the most severe dna fragmentation was observed in oocytes incubated in the follicular fluids containing p. acnes or l. gasseri (high-dose). no dna fragmentation was observed in the mouse oocytes incubated in the follicular fluid containing low-dose l. gasseri or e. faecalis. low human oocyte fertilization rates (<29%) were associated with extensive fragmentation in mouse oocytes (80-100%). bacteria colonizing human follicular fluid in vivo may cause dna fragmentation in mouse oocytes following 12h of in vitro incubation. follicular fluid bacteria may result in poor quality oocytes and/or embryos, leading to poor ivf outcomes.

TI  == viability reagent, prestoblue, in comparison with other available reagents, utilized in cytotoxicity and antimicrobial assays.
AB  == this study compared different commercially available viability reagents. the growth indicator reagents include p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet (int), prestoblue, and alamar blue which were used for antimicrobial analysis against streptococcus mutans, prevotella intermedia, propionibacterium acnes, and mycobacterium tuberculosis. prestoblue and alamar blue are resazurin based reagents that resulted in a quick and easily distinguishable colour change that allowed for visual readings. int and sodium 3'-[1-(phenyl amino-carbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis-[4-methoxy-6-nitro] benzene sulfonic acid hydrate (xtt) are tetrazolium based reagents which are converted to a formazan dye in the presence of metabolically active mitochondria enzyme. for cell viability analysis, reagents xtt and prestoblue were compared. prestoblue was able to clearly indicate the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of various positive drug controls on various microbial strains. prestoblue was also a good indicator of the 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) of positive drug controls on various cell lines.

TI  == special features of gram-positive bacterial eradication by photosensitizers.
AB  == antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacteria is a major concern and presents a special challenge for development of alternative antibacterial modalities. one of these alternative approaches is based on using the photodynamic therapy (pdt) for eradicating bacteria. photosensitizer-induced pdt exhibits unique properties and  demonstrates efficient microbe-killing effects. the efficient and irreversible antimicrobial effects of pdt are not dependent on the antibiotic susceptibility of the pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics. gram-positive bacteria exhibit efficient binding of the photosensitizer to the bacterial barriers, leading to immediate photoinactivation of the bacteria. photoinactivation of gram-positive bacteria by various photosensitizers has become a high priority, since these bacteria are responsible for life-threatening infections in humans, especially in the elderly and in compromised hosts in whom they cause hospital-acquired infections. the present review concentrates on the photoinactivation of staphylococi, streptococci, propionibacterium acnes, deinococcus radiodurans, aerobic spore-forming bacilli by various photosensitizers and by various methods  described in numerous works and patents.

TI  == sterility testing of apheresis hematopoietic progenitor cell products using an automated blood culture system.
AB  == background: aabb standards require monitoring of hematopoietic progenitor cell (hpc) products for microbial contamination. to date, there is no automated blood  culture system cleared by the food and drug administration for this application.  our objective was to validate the versatrek system (trek diagnostic systems) for  sterility testing of apheresis hpc products. study design and methods: four aerobic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, and bacillus cereus), five anaerobic bacteria (fusobacterium necrophorum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella loescheii, and propionibacterium acnes), and one fungus (candida albicans) were spiked into  apheresis hpc products at concentrations of 10, 10(2) , 10(3) , and 10(4) colony-forming units (cfus)/ml. aerobic and anaerobic bottles were incubated until positive or for up to 5 days. dna was simultaneously extracted for polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene. results: all aerobic bacteria grew in both bottles at all concentrations tested within 24 hours, and the time to positivity (ttp) was significantly shorter with  aerobic bottles. c. albicans grew in the aerobic media at all concentrations within 30 hours. anaerobes grew in the anaerobic bottle at all concentrations within 5 days. no bacteria were detected by using 16s rrna gene amplification at  10(4) cfus/ml. conclusion: compared to culture, 16s rrna gene amplification of hpcs does not improve sensitivity or turnaround time for hpc sterility testing. the versatrek system is a reliable tool for detecting microbial contamination of  apheresis hpc products with a limit of detection of less than or equal to 10 cfus/ml. inclusion of both the aerobic and the anaerobic culture bottles achieves the shortest ttp for all species tested.

TI  == detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates by a sensitive flow cytometric assay (bactiflow): a multicentre validation study.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates (pcs) still represents an ongoing risk. as a result of septic complications, particularly observed with older pcs, the shelf life of pcs has been reduced in germany to 4 days. in this study, bacterial screening of pcs by bactiflow (bf) flow cytometry  was introduced in three german blood services to evaluate the robustness and applicability of the assay. results were used to discuss the potential for the extension of pc shelf life to 5 days. study design and methods: a total of 1956 pcs were tested on days 4 or 5+ after pc production using the bf, whereas the bact/alert culture system served as reference method. results: two pcs were confirmed positive by culture only and were identified as propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus species. two pcs were confirmed positive for streptococcus mitis by bf and culture. additionally, two pcs were culture-positive only in one  culture bottle (aerobic: s. mitis and anaerobic: s. hominis). retrospective analysis of bacterial growth kinetics provide the indication that corresponding bacterial titres were most likely below the bf analytical detection limit (<150 cfu ml(-1) ) and had probably no transfusion relevance. all remaining specimens were tested negative. conclusions: testing of pcs by bf was successfully implemented. the bf proved sufficient as a rapid screening method to improve pc safety. this study further provides data supporting the extension of pc shelf life to 5 days after negative bf testing on day 4.

TI  == propionibacterium acnes (p. acnes) resistance and antibiotic use in patients attending australian general practice.
AB  == background/objectives: antibiotic resistance in the community, including transfer between bacteria, is a growing concern for clinicians. acne is commonly treated in general practice, sometimes with antibiotics. the aim of this study is to measure the rate of carriage of antibiotic resistant propionibacterium acnes 10 years apart in general practice and the relationship of resistance to type of treatment, as well potential effects on other flora. methods: patients (n = 215)  with acne presenting to australian capital territory and south-eastern new south  wales general practices were swabbed for p. acnes in 1997-1998 and 2007. clinical details were collected with questionnaires. in 2007 swabs were also taken for staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. gp's diagnostic classification of acne was tested using a set of standard photographs. results: resistant p. acnes was isolated from 20 patients (9%) and the proportion that was resistant was the same in 1997-1998 and in 2007. antibiotic use, particularly topical, was associated with p. acnes resistance. resistance rates declined with  the time elapsed since ceasing antibiotics. use of retinoids was associated with  a decreased chance of growing p. acnes (p = 0.008) but not with decreased resistance. simultaneous resistance with s. aureus was not detected, but only in  30 patients was s. aureus isolated. conclusions: p. acnes resistance was similar  in 1997-1998 and in 2007.the chance of a patient carrying a resistant strain of p. acnes is significantly greater with recent exposure to antibiotics, and clinicians should limit prescribing where possible. resistance disappears rapidly after ceasing antibiotics. cross resistance with other organisms was not detected in this study.

TI  == subgingival microbiota in adult down syndrome periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: the subgingival microbiota in down syndrome and non-down syndrome adults receiving periodic dental care was examined for 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization and the results were related to clinical periodontal attachment loss. material and methods: a total of 44 down syndrome, 66 non-down syndrome mentally retarded and 83 mentally normal adults were clinically evaluated. this involved, for each subject, the removal of subgingival specimens from three interproximal sites on different teeth; all subgingival samples per subject were then pooled and assessed for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial species using species-specific whole-genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significant group differences in species proportions averaged across subjects were evaluated using the kruskal-wallis test, and associations between subgingival species and mean subject attachment loss within down syndrome and non-down syndrome subject groups were quantified using pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analysis. results: down syndrome subjects exhibited greater attachment loss than  non-down syndrome subjects (p=0.05). most microbial species were present in down  syndrome subjects at levels similar to non-down syndrome subjects, except for higher proportions of selenomonas noxia, propionibacterium acnes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis in down syndrome subjects  compared with non-down syndrome study subjects, higher proportions of treponema socranskii in down syndrome subjects compared with non-down syndrome mentally retarded subjects, and higher proportions of streptococcus constellatus in down syndrome subjects compared with mentally normal subjects. down syndrome adults classified with periodontitis revealed higher subgingival levels of t. socranskii than down syndrome subjects with no periodontitis (p=0.02). higher subgingival proportions of s. constellatus, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, s. noxia  and prevotella nigrescens showed significant positive correlations (r=0.35-0.42)  and higher proportions of actinomyces naeslundii ii and actinomyces odontolyticus showed negative correlations (r=-0.36 to -0.40), with increasing mean subject attachment loss in down syndrome adults. conclusion: individuals with down syndrome show higher levels of some subgingival bacterial species and specific associations between certain subgingival bacterial species and loss of periodontal attachment. these findings are consistent with the notion that certain subgingival bacteria may contribute to the increased level of periodontal disease seen in down syndrome individuals and raise the question as to the reason for increased colonization in down syndrome.

AB  == introduction: this molecular study analyzed the microbiota of primary root canal  infections from adult norwegian patients. methods: samples were taken from the necrotic root canals of teeth with symptomatic (n = 13) or asymptomatic (n = 21)  apical periodontitis and chronic apical abscesses (n = 9). dna was extracted from samples, and bacterial identifications were performed by a closed-ended reverse-capture checkerboard approach targeting 50 candidate endodontic pathogens. results: bacterial dna was detected in all cases. in teeth with asymptomatic apical periodontitis, the most frequent taxa were dialister invisus  (71%), fusobacterium nucleatum (62%), and porphyromonas endodontalis (62%). in chronic apical abscesses, the most prevalent taxa were p. endodontalis (100%), d. invisus (89%), parvimonas micra (78%), and solobacterium moorei (78%). in teeth with symptomatic apical periodontitis, the most prevalent taxa were d. invisus, p. endodontalis, s. moorei, propionibacterium acnes, and streptococcus species (all in 69%). none of the targeted taxa were significantly associated with either sinus tract or pain (p > .05), except for selenomonas sputigena, which was more frequently found in painful cases (p = .04). no taxa were found in significantly  higher levels in any conditions (p > .05). cluster analyses revealed bacterial groupings that differed between cases with and without pain. conclusions: although basically the same species were highly prevalent in the different conditions examined and none of the most prevalent taxa were positively associated with symptoms, results revealed that species formed different partnerships and associations in samples from teeth with or without pain. therefore, it is possible that more virulent multispecies communities can form as a result of overall bacterial combinations and give rise to acute inflammation.

TI  == detection of nine microorganisms from the initial carious root lesions using a taqman-based real-time pcr.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to quantify nine selected cariogenic bacteria in plaque from sound root surfaces and initial carious root lesions using taqman pcr and to analyse a putative dependence on the kind of initial periodontal treatment. material and methods: fifty-four subjects with generalized chronic periodontitis were randomly allocated to one of the following initial periodontal therapies: full-mouth disinfection, full-mouth scaling and root planing or scaling and root planing within 7 days. plaque samples were taken before and after periodontal treatment and analysed by taqman pcr. results: the quantity of the cariogenic bacteria actinomyces spp., streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacilllus spp., rothia dentocariosa, parvimonas micra, propionibacterium acnes and neisseria mucosa were significantly higher, while the quantity of veillonella parvula was significantly lower on initial carious lesions than on the sound surfaces both before and after periodontal therapy. no significant differences could be found in any of the tested bacteria  except p. micra on initial carious lesions and sound surfaces for both examinations between the groups. conclusion: all the nine species analysed were found to be present in initial carious root lesions as well as sound root surfaces but in different quantities, independent of the different periodontal therapies.

TI  == validation of a microbial detection system for use with acd-a platelets with pas  iii platelet additive solution.
AB  == background: the bact/alert microbial detection system (bta) is used for testing leukoreduced apheresis platelets (lr-ap) in plasma. platelet additive solutions (pass) such as intersol (pas iii) may be used to reduce the amount of plasma transfused in lr-ap. this study evaluated the performance of the two-bottle bta testing scheme in the recovery of seeded microorganisms from lr-ap in intersol-plasma compared to a reference plate culture method. study design and methods: hyperconcentrated, double lr-ap were collected from healthy donors; intersol was added (65% intersol:35% plasma), equally divided into two containers, and then inoculated with an isolate of 1 of 10 clinically relevant index organisms at two levels. aerobic (bpa) and anaerobic (bpn) bta bottles were inoculated with 4 ml each of the inoculated lr-ap, and blood agar plates (baps) for aerobic and anaerobic culture (0.5 ml each). results: zero false-positives from 103 bottle pairs were observed. all 400 two-bottle bta tests were positive within 24 hours, except for propionibacterium acnes (maximum time-to-detection of 86.4 hr) and 13 of 20 pairs of streptococcus viridans (maximum time-to-detection  of 31.7 hr). thirteen of 400 bap two-plate tests were negative for starting bacterial concentrations of 10 colony-forming units (cfus)/ml or less. at 40 cfus/ml or less, bta was 100% positive while bap was 94% positive. conclusion: seeded organism recovery was superior in the two-bottle bta test system compared  to the two-plate bap system using intersol platelets (plts). this performance is  comparable to previously published results for plts in plasma. the use of intersol does not appear to have a detrimental effect on the performance of the two-bottle bta system.

TI  == impact of monocytic cells on recovery of uncultivable bacteria from atherosclerotic lesions.
AB  == objective: epidemiological evidence suggests that infections may contribute to atherogenesis. however, with the exception of chlamydophila pneumoniae, cultivable bacteria have not been recovered from atherosclerotic lesions. therefore, we aimed at developing an approach to recover uncultivable bacteria from atherectomy tissues. methods: we cultured homogenates from atherectomy specimens from seven nonseptic patients undergoing surgery for arterial obstruction either alone or together with thp-1 monocyte-like cells. we performed 16s rdna analysis, biochemical tests, random amplification of polymorphic dna pcr analysis, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) and immunohistofluorescence to identify the cultivated bacteria. wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to determine whether thp-1 treatment yielded a higher number of isolates than did the untreated controls. results: we recovered more bacteria from cocultures of atherectomy specimens with thp-1 cells than atherectomy specimens cultured alone. on average, tissue homogenates incubated with thp-1 cells versus control yielded 124 vs. 22 colony-forming units, a median of 140 vs. 7, respectively (p = 0.02). we recovered 872 isolates of limited number of species, including propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus infantis and the fastidious anaerobe porphyromonas gingivalis, and  confirmed its presence in tissue using double immunofluorescence imaging. qpcr demonstrated the presence of >/=3.5 x 10(3) p. gingivalis genomes per gram of atheromatous tissue. conclusions: these results indicate that viable previously uncultivable bacterial species are present within atheromas. our results suggest  revisiting the hypothesis that infections may have a causative role in atherosclerotic inflammation and have implications for research regarding novel diagnostics and treatments for cardiovascular disease.

TI  == in vivo antimicrobial effects of endodontic treatment procedures as assessed by molecular microbiologic techniques.
AB  == introduction: this culture-independent molecular microbiology study evaluated the antimicrobial effects of chemomechanical preparation supplemented by intracanal medication during treatment of teeth with apical periodontitis. methods: samples  were taken from 24 necrotic root canals at the baseline (s1), after chemomechanical preparation by using 2.5% naocl as the irrigant (s2), and after a 7-day interappointment medication with calcium hydroxide paste in either glycerin (chg) or camphorated paramonochlorophenol/glycerin (chpg) (s3). bacterial, archaeal, and fungal presence was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (pcr), and bacterial identifications were performed by a closed-ended reverse-capture checkerboard approach targeting 28 candidate endodontic pathogens. results: all s1 samples were positive for bacteria but negative for both archaea and fungi. treatment procedures were highly effective in reducing the bacterial levels and number of taxa. overall, 46% of s2 samples and 62.5% of s3 samples were pcr-negative for bacteria. specifically, s2 and s3 samples yielded negative pcr results in 50% and 58% of the canals in the chg group and in 42% and 67% of the canals in the chpg group, respectively. except for comparisons with s1 samples, no other statistically significant differences were observed for intragroup and intergroup comparisons involving s2 and s3. several taxa were still found in s2 and s3 samples, and the most prevalent were propionibacterium acnes and streptococcus species. conclusions: bacterial levels and number of taxa were substantially reduced after chemomechanical preparation and intracanal medication. however, presence of detectable levels of persisting bacteria in many cases indicates that the search for more effective antimicrobial treatment strategies should be stimulated.

TI  == comparison of the in vivo antimicrobial effectiveness of sodium hypochlorite and  chlorhexidine used as root canal irrigants: a molecular microbiology study.
AB  == introduction: the purpose of this clinical study was to compare the antimicrobial effects of 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (naocl) and 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate (chx) when used as irrigants during treatment of teeth with apical periodontitis. methods: forty-seven single-rooted single-canal teeth with necrotic pulps and asymptomatic apical periodontitis were selected for this study according to stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria. bacterial samples were taken at the baseline (s1) and after (s2) chemomechanical preparation using 2.5% naocl (n = 30) or 0.12% chx (n = 17) as the irrigant. bacterial, archaeal, and fungal presence was evaluated by broad-range polymerase chain reaction (pcr), whereas bacterial identifications were performed by a closed-ended reverse-capture checkerboard approach targeting 28 candidate endodontic pathogens. results: all s1 samples were pcr positive for bacterial presence but negative for both archaea and fungi. both naocl- and chx-based protocols were significantly effective in reducing the bacterial levels and number of taxa. no significant differences were observed between them in all tested parameters including the incidence of negative pcr results in s2 (40% for naocl vs 47% for chx, p = 0.8), reduction in  the number of taxa per canal (p = 0.3), and reduction in the bacterial levels (p  = 0.07). the most prevalent taxa in s2 samples from the naocl group were propionibacterium acnes, streptococcus species, porphyromonas endodontalis, and selenomonas sputigena. in the chx group, the most prevalent taxa in s2 were dialister invisus, actinomyces israelii, prevotella baroniae, propionibacterium acidifaciens, and streptococcus species. conclusions: treatment protocols using irrigation with either naocl or chx succeeded in significantly reducing the the number of bacterial taxa and their levels in infected root canals, with no significant difference between these substances.

TI  == apical root canal microbiota as determined by reverse-capture checkerboard analysis of cryogenically ground root samples from teeth with apical periodontitis.
AB  == introduction: bacteria located in the apical root canal system potentially participate in the pathogenesis of apical periodontitis. detection and identification of apical bacteria can be compromised because of limitations in conventional sampling and identification procedures. this study identified several bacterial taxa in the apical and middle/coronal segments of primarily infected root canal system by using pulverized root segments and a culture-independent molecular method. methods: seventeen extracted teeth with attached apical periodontitis lesions were sectioned to obtain 2 root fragments (apical and middle/coronal segments). root fragments were cryogenically ground, and dna was extracted from samples. after multiple displacement amplification, dna from samples was used as template in a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay targeting 28 bacterial taxa. results: bacterial dna was detected in all samples. the most prevalent taxa in the apical root canal system  were olsenella uli (76.5%), prevotella baroniae (71%), porphyromonas endodontalis (65%), fusobacterium nucleatum (53%), and tannerella forsythia (47%). o. uli, p.  endodontalis, and propionibacterium acnes were as frequently detected in apical samples as they were in middle/coronal samples. p. baroniae, t. forsythia, and f. nucleatum were found more frequently in the apical part of the canal as compared  with matched coronal segments. streptococcus species were more prevalent in middle/coronal samples. the median and mean of shared bacterial taxa between matched apical and middle/coronal segments were 27% and 41%, respectively. conclusions: several candidate endodontic pathogens were very prevalent in the apical root canal system. the apical microbiota was usually complex and differed  in species composition when compared with the microbiota of middle/coronal samples from the same tooth.

TI  == the development of antimicrobial resistance due to the antibiotic treatment of acne vulgaris: a review.
AB  == objective: to review recent studies on the use of antibiotics in acne vulgaris which provide insight into the development of antimicrobial resistance. data sources: sources for this article were identified by searching the english literature by medline for the period 1960 to march 2009. study selection: the following relevant terms were used: acne, acne vulgaris, acne and antibiotic therapy, acne and antimicrobial resistance, acne and resistance mechanisms, acne  and systemic infections, acne and antibiotic resistance and coagulase-negative staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), acne and antibiotic resistance and upper respiratory infection. data synthesis: both correct and incorrect use of antibiotics for acne vulgaris can promote antimicrobial resistance. the development of this resistance is promoted by several factors, including antibiotic monotherapy, long-term administration of antibiotics, indiscriminate use outside their strict indications, dosing below the recommended levels, and the administration of antibiotics without concurrent benzoyl peroxide and/or topical retinoids. conclusion: long-term use of antibiotics in the treatment of acne vulgaris can lead to antimicrobial resistance with serious and intractable problems not limited to propionibacterium acnes (p. acnes), the skin and acne vulgaris themselves, but also to other bacterial species, with systemic consequences. these findings suggest that antibiotics should be prescribed in combination with benzoyl peroxide and/or topical retinoids and be limited to a maximum of several months.

TI  == [clinical relevance of time-to-positivity in bactec9240 blood culture system].
AB  == background: continuous monitoring systems have allowed determination of the time-to-positivity (ttp). we evaluated the clinical relevance of ttp in the bactec9240 system (becton-dickinson, usa). methods: a total of 2,354 vials of positive blood cultures were evaluated over 2 months. ttp was monitored from each of bactec plus aerobic/f (bd) or pediatric plus/f and lytic anaerobic/f bottles,  and the differential time-to-positivity (dtp) for blood samples drawn simultaneously via catheter and a peripheral site was determined. results: the average ttp of the positive vials was 17.4 hr, and 79.9% and 95.2% of the vials showed positivity within 24 and 48 hr, respectively. while the average ttp values for aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, acinetobacter baumannii, and streptococcus pneumoniae were less than 10 hr, those for candida spp., anaerobes, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium spp, bacillus spp. other than cereus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were 35.3, 27.0, 56.8, 45.8, 23.0, and 26.3  hr, respectively. the negative predictive values of ttp over 24 hr to predict staphylococcus aureus among staphylococci and s. pneumoniae among alpha-hemolytic streptococci were 76.7% and 100%, respectively. enterobacteriaceae and enterococcus faecalis showed shorter ttp in anaerobic vials than in aerobic vials. dtp of more than 2 hr was observed for 27.8%, 72.2%, and 45.5% of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and candida spp. conclusions: ttp can be used to discriminate pathogens and contaminants. the shorter ttp in anaerobic vials of certain enterobacteriaceae and enterococcus spp. would facilitate further identification. dtp is useful for diagnosing catheter-related bloodstream infection by s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and candida spp.

TI  == metagenomic detection of phage-encoded platelet-binding factors in the human oral cavity.
AB  == the human oropharynx is a reservoir for many potential pathogens, including streptococcal species that cause endocarditis. although oropharyngeal microbes have been well described, viral communities are essentially uncharacterized. we conducted a metagenomic study to determine the composition of oropharyngeal dna viral communities (both phage and eukaryotic viruses) in healthy individuals and  to evaluate oropharyngeal swabs as a rapid method for viral detection. viral dna  was extracted from 19 pooled oropharyngeal swabs and sequenced. viral communities consisted almost exclusively of phage, and complete genomes of several phage were recovered, including escherichia coli phage t3, propionibacterium acnes phage pa6, and streptococcus mitis phage sm1. phage relative abundances changed dramatically depending on whether samples were chloroform treated or filtered to  remove microbial contamination. pbla and pblb genes of phage sm1 were detected in the metagenomes. pbla and pblb mediate the attachment of s. mitis to platelets and play a significant role in s. mitis virulence in the endocardium, but have never previously been detected in the oral cavity. these genes were also identified in salivary metagenomes from three individuals at three time points and in individual saliva samples by pcr. additionally, we demonstrate that phage  sm1 can be induced by commonly ingested substances. our results indicate that the oral cavity is a reservoir for pbla and pblb genes and for phage sm1 itself. further studies will determine the association between pbla and pblb genes in the oral cavity and the risk of endocarditis.

TI  == bacterial colonization and infection of electrophysiological cardiac devices detected with sonication and swab culture.
AB  == background: electrophysiological cardiac devices are increasingly used. the frequency of subclinical infection is unknown. we investigated all explanted devices using sonication, a method for detection of microbial biofilms on foreign bodies. methods and results: consecutive patients in whom cardiac pacemakers and  implantable cardioverter/defibrillators were removed at our institution between october 2007 and december 2008 were prospectively included. devices (generator and/or leads) were aseptically removed and sonicated, and the resulting sonication fluid was cultured. in parallel, conventional swabs of the generator pouch were performed. a total of 121 removed devices (68 pacemakers, 53 implantable cardioverter/defibrillators) were included. the reasons for removal were insufficient battery charge (n=102), device upgrading (n=9), device dysfunction (n=4), or infection (n=6). in 115 episodes (95%) without clinical evidence of infection, 44 (38%) grew bacteria in sonication fluid, including propionibacterium acnes (n=27), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n=11), gram-positive anaerobe cocci (n=3), gram-positive anaerobe rods (n=1), gram-negative rods (n=1), and mixed bacteria (n=1). in 21 of 44 sonication-positive episodes, bacterial counts were significant (>or=10 colony-forming units/ml of sonication fluid). in 26 sterilized controls, sonication cultures remained negative in 25 cases (96%). in 112 cases without clinical infection, conventional swab cultures were performed: 30 cultures (27%)  were positive, and 18 (60%) were concordant with sonication fluid cultures. six devices and leads were removed because of infection, growing staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mitis, and coagulase-negative staphylococci in 6 sonication fluid cultures and 4 conventional swab cultures. conclusions: bacteria can colonize cardiac electrophysiological devices without clinical signs of infection.

TI  == identification of bacteria enduring endodontic treatment procedures by a combined reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and reverse-capture checkerboard  approach.
AB  == introduction: this study identified the bacterial taxa enduring endodontic treatment procedures by using a combined 16s ribosomal rna-based reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) and reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization approach. methods: samples were taken from infected canals of 15 teeth with apical periodontitis before treatment (s1), after chemomechanical preparation with naocl as the irrigant (s2), and after interappointment medication with a calcium hydroxide paste (s3). bacterial presence was first screened by a dna-based single pcr assay. rna extracts were subjected to rt-pcr, and the resulting products were surveyed for the presence of 28 targeted taxa by using the checkerboard method. results: bacteria were found in all s1 samples. detectable levels of bacterial ribosomal rna, used as an indicator of viability, were observed in 60% of the cases after chemomechanical preparation and 53% after intracanal medication. the most prevalent taxa in s1 were olsenella uli (67%), pyramidobacter piscolens (60%), streptococcus species (53%), and bacteroidetes clone x083 (53%). streptococcus species (47%), fusobacterium nucleatum (40%), and o. uli (33%) prevailed in s2, whereas streptococcus species (47%), propionibacterium acnes (27%), and o. uli (27%) were the most frequent taxa in s3. conclusions: the present study with a combined molecular approach revealed that bacterial diversity was overall markedly reduced by treatment procedures. although bacterial taxa more frequently identified in post-treatment samples emerge as potential risk factors for persistent disease, this remains to be determined by longitudinal studies.

TI  == infectious pericarditis: an experience spanning a decade.
AB  == background: although recent literature suggests a changing spectrum for infectious pericarditis (ip), this view has not been proven. in this report, we aim to review the features of ip in cases from a large tertiary centre. methods:  a retrospective review of our institution's database was conducted to identify cases with ip between january 1994 and december 2004. all pericardial biopsy tissue results from the same period were also reviewed. results: one hundred and  thirty-eight cases were identified, of which 14 cases were identified by pathology. the mean age was 53 +/- 18 years, and 74% were men. the most frequently identified causative organisms were propionibacterium acnes (p. acnes), staphylococci and streptococci. a common predisposing factor was an immune-compromised state, followed by cardiac surgery. fifty-five patients were treated with antibiotics (medical group) while 63 cases (surgical group) underwent surgical drainage (pericardial window) and/or pericardiectomy. in comparison to the medical group, the surgical group was more critically ill and immunocompromised (40% versus 24%, respectively). there were 52 late deaths during follow-up. mortality in the medical group was 67% while in the surgical group it was 24% (p < 0.0001). conclusions: in contradistinction to the literature reports, the most prevalent organism for ip was p. acnes. patients managed aggressively with both antibiotics and surgery, demonstrated lower mortality rates. therefore, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion  for ip so that timely and appropriate mortality-reducing strategies can be offered.

TI  == assessment of the bacterial diversity of human colostrum and screening of staphylococcal and enterococcal populations for potential virulence factors.
AB  == in contrast to breast milk, little is known about the bacterial composition of human colostrum. the objective of this work was to analyze the bacterial diversity of colostrum obtained from healthy women and to characterize the dominant bacterial species for the presence of possible virulence factors. samples of colostrum obtained from 36 healthy women were inoculated into different culture media. several isolates from each medium were selected and identified. staphylococcal and enterococcal isolates were submitted to genetic profiling. one representative of each profile was included in a genetic and phenotypic characterization scheme, including detection of potential virulence traits/genes and sensitivity to antibiotics. staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis were the dominant species, followed by streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus lugdunensis. among the 48 s. epidermidis isolates selected on the basis of their genetic profiles, the biofilm-related icad gene and the meca gene were detected in only 11 and six isolates, respectively. in parallel, 10 enterococcal isolates were also characterized and none of them contained the cyla, vana, vanb, vand, vane and vang genes. all of them were sensitive to vancomycin. there were no indications that the colostrum samples contained harmful bacteria.

TI  == biofilms in skin infections: propionibacterium acnes and acne vulgaris.
AB  == it is generally accepted that many human infections are biofilm-related and that  sessile (biofilm-grown) cells are highly resistant against antimicrobial agents.  propionibacterium acnes plays a role in the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris, a common disorder of the pilosebaceous follicles and it has been suggested that p.  acnes cells residing within the follicles grow as a biofilm. although p. acnes biofilms have not been observed directly in the pilosebaceous unit, the observation that p. acnes readily forms biofilm in vitro as well as on various medical devices in vivo, combined with the high resistance of sessile p. acnes cells and the increased production of particular virulence factors and qourum sensing molecules in sessile cells point in this direction. in addition, in vitro and in vivo biofilm formation has also been demonstrated for other microorganisms involved in skin diseases (including staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes).

TI  == novel endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidases with broader substrate specificity.
AB  == in an effort to identify novel endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidases (endo-alpha-galnacases), four potential genes were cloned. three of the expressed proteins engef from enterococcus faecalis, engpa from propionibacterium acnes, and engcp from clostridium perfringens were purified and characterized. their substrate specificity was investigated and compared to the commercially available endo-alpha-galnacases from streptococcus pneumoniae (engsp) and alcaligenes sp. (engal). all enzymes were incubated with various synthetic substrates, and natural glycoproteins and the released sugars were detected by colorimetric assay and thin layer chromatography analysis. the core 1 disaccharide gal beta 1,3galnac alpha 1pnp was the most rapidly hydrolyzed substrate by all enzymes tested. engef exhibited the highest k(cat) for this substrate. engef and engpa were also able to fully hydrolyze the core 3 disaccharide glcnac beta 1,3galnac alpha 1pnp. this is the first report of endo-alpha-galnacases engef and engpa acting on core 3 in addition to core 1 o-glycans. interestingly, there were no significant differences in transglycosylation activities when gal beta 1,3galnac  alpha 1pnp or glcnac beta 1,3galnac alpha 1pnp was incubated with various 1-alkanols in the presence of the endo-alpha-galnacases tested in this work.

AB  == the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effects of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine on the viability of some oral bacterial species. it also evaluated the ability of these bacteria to metabolize those substances. single-species biofilms of streptococcus gordonii, porphyromonas gingivalis, or fusobacterium nucleatum and dual-species biofilms of s. gordonii -- f. nucleatum and f. nucleatum -- p. gingivalis were grown on hydroxyapatite discs. seven species were studied as planktonic cells, including streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces naeslundii, and the species mentioned above. the viability of planktonic cells and biofilms was analyzed by susceptibility tests and time-kill assays, respectively, against different concentrations of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine. high-performance liquid chromatography was performed to quantify nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine concentrations in the culture media after the assays. susceptibility tests and viability assays showed  that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine cannot reduce or stimulate bacterial growth. high-performance liquid chromatography results showed that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine concentrations were not altered after bacteria exposure. these findings indicate that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine, in the concentrations used, cannot affect significantly the growth of these oral bacterial strains. moreover, these species do not seem to metabolize these substances.

TI  == infection associated with hematoma formation after shoulder arthroplasty.
AB  == hematoma formation requiring operative treatment after shoulder arthroplasty may  be associated with higher patient morbidity. we therefore determined whether there was an association of hematoma formation requiring operative treatment with deep infection after shoulder arthroplasty. between 1978 and 2006, we performed 4147 shoulder arthroplasties in 3643 patients. of these, 12 shoulders (0.3%) underwent reoperation for hematoma formation. the mean time interval from arthroplasty to surgery for the hematoma was 7 days (range, 0.5-31 days). among nine cases in which cultures were taken, six had positive cultures; the organisms included propionibacterium acnes in three, staphylococcus epidermidis in one, streptococcus species in one, and staphylococcus epidermidis with peptostreptococcus in one. the minimum followup was 12 months (mean, 68 months; range, 12 to 294 months). two of the 12 patients eventually underwent resection arthroplasty for deep infection. the neer score was excellent in one, satisfactory in six, and unsatisfactory in five patients. the data suggest hematoma formation after shoulder arthroplasty is often accompanied by positive intraoperative cultures. the surgeon should be aware of the high rate of unsatisfactory results associated with this complication as well as the possibility of developing a deep infection requiring additional surgery. level of evidence: level iv, prognostic study. see guidelines for authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

TI  == salivary microbiota of hiv-positive children and its correlation with hiv status, oral diseases, and total secretory iga.
AB  == aim: this study aimed to investigate the prevalence and levels of salivary microorganisms in hiv-positive children, and their correlation to hiv status, oral lesions, and salivary iga levels. design: forty-two hiv-positive and 36 control children were clinically examined, had their saliva collected and processed for the microbiological analysis of 38 bacterial taxa by the checkerboard method, and salivary iga quantification by elisa. results: the majority of the species tested were more prevalent in control children than in the hiv group. mean concentration of total salivary iga was similar in both groups. high levels of veillonella parvula were found in children with cheilitis  and herpes. tannerella forsythia, eikenella corrodens, and propionibacterium acnes were prevalent in children with gingivitis, while fusobacterium periodonticum, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus oralis were significantly more frequent in children with no oral lesions. significant negative correlations between salivary iga levels and eubacterium nodatum and oral streptococci were observed (p < 0.05). conclusion: hiv-seropositive children presented significantly lower prevalence and levels of several bacterial species  in saliva; hiv-positive children are able to mount a mucosal immune response; hiv-seropositive children under highly active antiretroviral therapy presented low prevalence of oral lesions.

TI  == treatment of primary isolated shoulder sepsis in the adult patient.
AB  == isolated shoulder sepsis is an uncommon clinical problem with little information  in the literature on causative organisms and potential sequelae. we examined the  organisms involved, surgical treatments, antibiotic treatments rendered, and complications in these cases. we retrospectively reviewed the records of 19 adult patients (19 shoulders) who underwent operative treatment of isolated shoulder sepsis from 1996 to 2005. patient age, gender, laboratory studies, previous treatment, surgical procedures, surgical findings, cultured organism, antibiotic  treatment, and complications were reviewed. the organisms included methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (five), streptococcus b beta hemolytic (five), staphylococcus epidermidis (three), negative cultures (two), streptococcus viridans (one), escherichia coli (one), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (one), and propionibacterium acnes (one). we treated patients with intravenous antibiotics an average of 4.2 weeks (range, 3-8 weeks). one patient underwent humeral head resection with an antibiotic spacer. another patient died  during hospitalization. open or arthroscopic debridement in conjunction with appropriate antibiotics appears effective in eradicating infection in most adults who present with shoulder sepsis. functional outcome is poor in those patients with irreparable rotator cuff tears and/or cartilage loss. level of evidence: level iv, therapeutic study. see the guidelines for authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

TI  == skin microbiota: a source of disease or defence?
AB  == microbes found on the skin are usually regarded as pathogens, potential pathogens or innocuous symbiotic organisms. advances in microbiology and immunology are revising our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of microbial virulence and the specific events involved in the host-microbe interaction. current data contradict some historical classifications of cutaneous microbiota and suggest that these organisms may protect the host, defining them not as simple symbiotic  microbes but rather as mutualistic. this review will summarize current information on bacterial skin flora including staphylococcus, corynebacterium, propionibacterium, streptococcus and pseudomonas. specifically, the review will discuss our current understanding of the cutaneous microbiota as well as shifting paradigms in the interpretation of the roles microbes play in skin health and disease.

TI  == aortitis following percutaneous aortic side branch embolization prior to endovascular repair of infrarenal aortic aneurysm.
AB  == purpose: to report two cases of life-threatening aortic infection after percutaneous endovascular coil embolization prior to endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (aaa) repair (evar). case report: two 76-year-old patients were readmitted 5 days and 3 weeks, respectively, after technically successful percutaneous coil embolization of aortic side branches in advance of scheduled evar. in the first patient, the right hypogastric artery, the inferior mesenteric artery (ima), and a lumbar artery had been embolized, whereas in the second patient only the right hypogastric artery and the ima had been occluded. on admission, both patients presented with severe abdominal pain. investigations revealed acute aortic infection in both patients, combined with substantial aaa enlargement in one. open surgical infrarenal aortic replacement was performed using homografts, and antibiotic therapy was initiated. after uneventful recovery, both patients were asymptomatic, had intact aortic homografts, and showed no evidence of infection after 12 and 18 months of follow-up, respectively. conclusion: endovascular infections are a potentially serious complication following percutaneous coil embolization of major aortic branches. early diagnosis and dedicated therapy are mandatory. immediate resection of the infected aorta and replacement with homografts in association with prolonged antibiotic treatment showed good midterm results.

TI  == microcalorimetry: a novel method for detection of microbial contamination in platelet products.
AB  == background: measuring heat from replicating microorganisms in culture may be a rapid, accurate, and simple screening method for platelets (plts). microcalorimetry for detection of microorganisms in in vitro contaminated plt products was evaluated. study design and methods: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sanguinis, escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, and candida albicans were inoculated in single-donor apheresis plts to achieve target concentrations of 10(5), 10(3), 10, or 1 colony-forming units (cfu) per ml of plts. contaminated plts in growth medium were incubated at 37 degrees c for 5 days in a calorimeter. positivity was defined as heat flow of at least 10 microw above the lowest value of the power-time curve. results: with microcalorimetry, inocula of 10 cfus per ml plts  could be detected with the following detection times: s. epidermidis (31.65 hr),  s. aureus (24.24 hr), s. sanguinis (7.82 hr), e. coli (7.53 hr), p. acnes (73.57  hr), and c. albicans (43.77 hr). the detection time was less than 4 hr at 10(5) cfus per ml plts for s. aureus, s. sanguinis, and e. coli. noncontaminated plts remained negative. the total heat ranged from 2.8 (s. sanguinis) to 8.3 j (e. coli). the shape of the power-time curve was species-specific and independent from the initial concentration of microorganisms. conclusion: the detection limit of microcalorimetry was 1 to 10 cfus per ml plts. microcalorimetry is a promising novel method for detection of contaminated plts. applying this method to all plt  products could reduce the frequency of transfusion-related sepsis and prolong the shelf life of plts.

TI  == comparison of azithromycin and moxifloxacin against bacterial isolates causing conjunctivitis.
AB  == objective: to examine in vitro resistance to azithromycin and moxifloxacin in bacterial conjunctivitis isolates. methods: mic90s (minimum inhibitory concentration) and resistance rates to azithromycin and moxifloxacin were determined based upon microtiter broth dilution and/or antimicrobial gradient test strips in a multicenter phase iii study and confirmed externally. results: the most common isolates collected from bacterial conjunctivitis patients in the  phase iii study were haemophilus influenzae (40.6%), followed by staphylococcus epidermidis (19.3%), propionibacterium acnes (17.3%), streptococcus pneumoniae (16.8%), and staphylococcus aureus (0.06%). mic90s for all of these organisms were well below established resistance breakpoints for moxifloxacin, indicating no bacterial resistance. on the other hand, the mic90 for h. influenzae was 3-fold higher than the resistance breakpoint for azithromycin, > or = 128-fold higher for s. epidermidis, 16-fold higher for s. pneumoniae and > or = 128-fold higher for s. aureus, indicating moderate to very high bacterial resistance to azithromycin. conclusions: resistance to azithromycin is more common than resistance to moxifloxacin in clinical isolates causing bacterial conjunctivitis.

TI  == prevention of transfusion of platelet components contaminated with low levels of  bacteria: a comparison of bacteria culture and pathogen inactivation methods.
AB  == background: this study compared the efficacy of bacterial detection with inactivation for reducing the risk associated with transfusion of platelet (plt)  components contaminated with low levels of bacteria. study design and methods: twenty-one double-dose plts were spiked with seven species of bacteria at three levels (0.003-0.03, 0.03-0.3, 0.3-3 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml). after split, each plt unit contained 1 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000 cfus. one unit was photochemically treated (pct; 150 micromol/l amotosalen and 3 j/cm(2) ultraviolet a). the other unit was untreated. all units were stored and sampled on days 1, 2, and 5 of storage for aerobic and anaerobic culture in the bact/alert system (biomerieux). plts were classified as sterile when no bacterial growth was detected after 120 hours of culture. results: in all pct plts, no bacteria were detected throughout 5 days of storage regardless of species, level of contamination, and sampling time. in untreated plts, staphylococcus aureus was consistently detected by culturing. growth of 1 to 10 cfus per unit staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 to 100 cfus per unit of klebsiella pneumoniae, and  1 to 1000 cfus per unit propionibacterium acnes was delayed and only detectable after 5, 2, and 5 days of storage, respectively. low levels of streptococcus agalactiae (1-10 cfus/unit), escherichia coli (1-100 cfus/unit), and clostridium  perfringens (1-100 cfus/unit) were not detected during 5 days of storage, although bacterial outgrowth was detected at higher levels of contamination. conclusions: for the seven bacterial species examined, contaminated plts may be released for transfusion on test-negative-to-date status. in contrast, bacterial  inactivation by pct could reduce the risk associated with transfusion of plts contaminated with low levels of these bacteria.

TI  == microbiology of acute sinusitis of odontogenic origin presenting with periorbital cellulitis in children.
AB  == objectives: this study was undertaken to evaluate the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of acute maxillary sinusitis of odontogenic origin presenting with periodontal infection in children. methods: aspirates of 18 acutely infected maxillary sinuses that were associated with odontogenic infection in children who presented with periorbital cellulitis were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. results: a total of 54 isolates were recovered (3.0 per specimen): 13 aerobic and facultative (0.7 per specimen) and 41 anaerobic (2.3 per specimen). the number of isolates per specimen varied from 1 to 4. aerobic and facultative organisms alone were recovered in 2 specimens (11%), anaerobes only in 7 (39%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 9 (50%). the predominant aerobic and  facultative organisms were alpha-hemolytic streptococci (4), microaerophilic streptococci (3), and streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus (2 each).  the predominant anaerobic bacteria were anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (17), peptostreptococcus spp (11), fusobacterium spp (8), and propionibacterium acnes (2). twelve beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were recovered from 9 specimens (50%). conclusions: this study demonstrates the unique aerobic and anaerobic microbiological features of acute maxillary sinusitis of odontogenic origin presenting with periorbital cellulitis in children.

TI  == variable expression of immunoreactive surface proteins of propionibacterium acnes.
AB  == despite accumulating data implicating propionibacterium acnes in a variety of diseases, its precise role in infection remains to be determined. p. acnes antigen-specific cd4(+) t cells are present in early inflamed acne lesions and may be involved in the inflammatory response; however, little is known about the  specific antigens involved. in this study, b cell and t cell antigens from p. acnes expression libraries were cloned and evaluated and the four predominant proteins identified were investigated. two of these antigens share some homology  with an m-like protein of streptococcus equi and have dermatan-sulphate-binding activity (pa-25957 and 5541). the remaining two antigens, pa-21693 and 4687, are  similar to the product of the corynebacterium diphtheriae htaa gene from the hmu  abc transport locus, although only one of these (pa-21693) is encoded within an hmu-like operon and conserved amongst a range of clinical isolates. all four proteins contain an lpxtg motif, although only pa-21693 contains a characteristic sortase-sorting signal. variation in the expression of pa-4687, 25957 and 5541 is evident amongst clinical isolates and is generated both by frameshifts associated with the putative signal peptide and by variable numbers of repeat regions toward the carboxy-terminus, potentially generating heterogeneity of molecular mass and  antigenic variation. in addition, in the case of pa-25957, a frameshift in a c-rich region at the extreme carboxy-terminus eliminates the lpxtg motif in some  isolates. for the dermatan-sulphate-binding pa-25957, igg1 antibody in serum from acne-positive donors was shown to be specific for the amino-terminal region of the protein, which also contains a cd4(+) t cell epitope. in contrast, serum from acne-negative donors shows an igg2 and igg3 antibody subclass response to the carboxy-terminal region. these data have implications for the potential role of p. acnes in inflammatory acne and other diseases.

TI  == bacterial diversity in aortic aneurysms determined by 16s ribosomal rna gene analysis.
AB  == background: aortic aneurysms are common vascular conditions that cause considerable morbidity and mortality. understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the condition remains limited. recently, infection has been suggested as possible contributor in the development of the disease. the aim of the present study was to examine aortic aneurysms for the presence of bacterial dna using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) targeting the 16s ribosomal rna (rrna)  gene, followed by cloning and sequencing. methods: universal eubacterial primers  were used to amplify 16s rrna bacterial genes in 10 specimens from arterial walls of aortic aneurysms. subsequently, pcr amplicons were cloned into escherichia coli and sequencing of the cloned inserts was used to determine species identity  or closest relatives by comparison with known sequences in genbank. results: sequences of stenotrophomonas spp., including s. maltophilia (formerly pseudomonas homology group v) were detected in six aneurysm samples. propionibacterium acnes was identified in five samples, and brevundimonas diminuta (formerly p. diminuta) in four samples. other species previously assigned to the pseudomonas genus such as comamonas testosteroni, delftia acidovorans, burkholderia cepacia, herbaspirillum sp., and acidovorax sp. were also detected. some clones fell into other environmental species, including methylobacterium sp. and bradyrhizobium elkanii, and others represented bacteria  that have not yet been cultivated. dna sequences from oral bacteria, including streptococcus sanguinis, tannerella forsythia, and leptotrichia buccalis were detected. sequences from prevotella melaninogenica and lactobacillus delbrueckii, which are commonly found in both mouth and gastrointestinal tract, were also detected. additional species included dermacoccus spp. and corynebacterium vitaeruminis. conclusions: a wide variety of bacteria, including oral bacteria, was found to colonize aortic aneurysms and may play a role in their development.  several of these microorganisms have not yet been cultivated. clinical relevance: although chlamydophila pneumoniae has been detected in aneurysmal walls, its exact role in the condition remains inconclusive. overall, there is scarce information about the role of microorganisms in aneurysmal disease. in the present study, we used molecular genetics to detect a diversity of bacteria in arterial walls of aortic aneurysms. the presence of multiple microorganisms in aneurysmal disease may have implications for chemoprophylaxis and antibiotic treatment if directed only at c.pneumoniae.

AB  == we report the in vitro inhibition of propionibacterium acnes (p. acnes) by a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (blis-like substance) produced by streptococcus salivarius (s. salivarius). bacteriocins are proteinaceous substances produced by bacteria that are capable of inhibiting the growth of similar bacterial strains. unlike classical antibiotics, they have a relatively narrow spectrum of killing activity, resulting in a reduction in the intensity of selection for resistance. these findings suggest that blis may potentially be used for its anti-p. acnes activity in the treatment of acne.

AB  == objective: to study bacterial 16s rna in archival prostate samples from 352 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (bph) and evaluate whether the presence of bacterial dna was different in those who later developed prostate cancer (n =  171) and in the matched controls that did not progress to cancer (n = 181). methods: 16s dna pcr followed by cloning and sequencing the positive samples. results: in 96/352 (27%) of the prostate tissue specimens 16s rna were detected.  sequence analysis revealed propionibacterium acnes as the predominant microorganism (23% of 16s rna positive patients). the second most frequent isolate-escherichia coli was found in 12 (12%) patients. the other isolates included pseudomonas sp. (3 patients), actinomyces sp. (2), streptococcus mutans  (1), corynebacterium sp. (2), nocardioides sp. (1), rhodococcus sp. (1) veillonella sp. (2). in p. acnes positive samples 62% exhibited severe histological inflammation versus 50% in the bacteria-negative group (p = 0.602).  the presence of p. acnes in the prostate was associated with prostate cancer development (or 2.17, 95% ci 0.77-6.95). conclusions: this study has revealed p.  acnes as the most common bacteria in the prostate in bph. further studies are needed to clarify its role in contributing to the development of prostatic inflammation and prostate cancer.

TI  == commensal oral bacteria antigens prime human dendritic cells to induce th1, th2 or treg differentiation.
AB  == in various immunopathologic conditions, bacterial flora induce an immune response which results in inflammatory manifestations, e.g. periapical granuloma. dendritic cells provide the main orchestration of specific immune responses. the  aim of our study was to test the capacity of distinct oral bacterial antigens (prepared from streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides spp.) to prime human dendritic cells for stimulation of the t-lymphocyte response. to assess the t-lymphocyte response, the expression of cd25, cd69, intracellular interferon gamma (cifn-gamma), and intracellular interleukin 4 (cil-4) was determined. dendritic cells were prepared from leukocyte buffy coat from healthy blood donors. monocytes were stimulated with il-4 and gm-csf and dendritic cells activated with bacterial lysates. cell suspensions contained up to 90% dendritic cells, which represented 2-12% of the initial number of mononuclear cells. lymphocyte subsets that developed in lymphocyte cultures after 1 week of stimulation were analyzed by flow cytometry. dendritic cells, primed with antigens of bacteroides fragilis have shown significantly higher activation  and expression of intercellular ifn-gamma by t lymphocytes compared to negative controls. the dendritic cells primed with antigens of p. acnes had no effect on t-lymphocyte activation or cytokine production; instead they induced differentiation of t lymphocytes into cd25bright cells (regulatory t cells) with  a potentially inhibitory effect on immune response. dendritic cells primed with antigens of s. mitis induced increased expression of cil-4. we conclude that commensal oral bacteria antigens prepared from b. fragilis, s. mitis, and p. acnes prime human dendritic cells to induce th1, th2, and t(reg) differentiation, respectively. this may advance our understanding of immunopathologic manifestations in the oral cavity and offer new possibilities for redirecting immune responses in mucosal vaccination.

TI  == in vivo evaluation of the effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on salivary bacteria using the checkerboard method.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on different species of the oral microbiota. methodology: saliva samples were collected from 20 subjects with good oral health, diluted and plated onto blood agar medium. the subjects were asked to place the strip (listerine pocketpaks) on the tongue allowing it to dissolve. after 30 minutes, new saliva samples were collected again and the plates with the samples were incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees c for seven days. colony counts (cfu/ml) were determined for each sample. the colonies on the plates were washed with 1 ml of te buffer, and the bacterial suspensions were processed for the identification of 24 species by dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. differences in total counts, prevalence, and levels of the species evaluated before and after placement of the strips were determined by wilcoxon sign rank and chi-square tests. results: a modest increase in the total bacterial number in saliva from 1.4 x 10(8) to 1.7 x 10(8) bacterial cells  was observed 30 minutes after the strip placement, although this change was not significant (p = 0.632). most of the species reduced in frequency and/or levels,  including the pathogens a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, e. corrodens, fusobacterium spp., p. intermedia, and s. noxia, as well as the beneficial species a. meyeri, a. georgia, a. gerencseriae, a. odontolyticus, and p. acnes after strip placement. in contrast, a. viscosus, p. melaninogenica, p. gingivalis, p. micros, streptococcus spp., t. forsythensis, and v. parvula presented an increase in prevalence and/or levels. these changes were not statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons (p > 0.0022).  conclusion: the use of the essential oil-containing oral strips resulted in a short-term small increase in the total number of salivary microorganisms. in addition, a not significant decrease of certain periodontopathogens, and an increase in species compatible with oral health were observed.

TI  == infectious keratitis in the corneal graft: treatment with partial conjunctival flaps.
AB  == background and objective: the infection of the corneal graft is one of the most serious complications following keratoplasty. in many instances, it can be treated successfully with intensive topical and subconjunctival antibiotics. however, when this therapy is ineffective, a surgical approach must be considered. the usefulness of partial conjunctival flaps that spare the visual axis for managing corneal graft infections is reported. patients and methods: retrospective review of four cases. all patients were males between 12 and 85 years old. the four abscesses developed in the penetrating corneal graft during the first year after keratoplasty. the organisms found were propionibacterium acnes, candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae. after failure of medical therapy, they were operated on using the partial, thick  conjunctival flap technique. results: resolution of the infection and maintenance of a clear graft was achieved in all patients. the follow-up ranged from 5 to 8 years. conclusion: the partial conjunctival flap is an effective surgical procedure for the treatment of abscesses in penetrating keratoplasties when medical treatment has failed.

TI  == microbiology of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis.
AB  == objectives: we undertook to evaluate the microbiology of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis (aecs). methods: repeated aspirations of maxillary sinus secretions by endoscopy were performed in 7 patients over a period of 125 to 242  days. results: bacteria were recovered for all 22 aspirates, and the number of isolates was between 2 and 4. a total of 54 isolates were isolated: 16 aerobic and facultative bacteria and 38 anaerobic bacteria. the aerobic bacteria were haemophilus influenzae (7 isolates), streptococcus pneumoniae (3), moraxella catarrhalis (3), staphylococcus aureus (2), and klebsiella pneumoniae (1). the anaerobic bacteria included pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp (19), peptostreptococcus spp (9), fusobacterium spp (8), and propionibacterium acnes (2). a change in the types of isolates was noted in all consecutive cultures obtained from the same patients as different organisms emerged and previously isolated bacteria were no longer recovered. an increase in antimicrobial resistance was noted in 6 instances. conclusions: this study illustrates the microbial dynamics of aecs in which anaerobic and aerobic bacteria prevail, and highlights the importance of obtaining cultures from patients with aecs for guidance in selection of proper antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == evaluation of bact/alert plastic culture bottles for use in testing pooled whole  blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich plasma platelets with a single contaminated unit.
AB  == background: in certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (plt)-rich plasma  plts can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. one prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single  unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 cfus/ml). this study evaluated the bact/alert (biomerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. study design and methods: bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single plt units (target, 10 and 100 cfus/ml; mean recovered, 5 and 92 cfus/ml) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 ml was plated (10 sets). results: all cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 cfus per ml. with b. cereus (< or =2 cfus/ml), all bottles were reactive. with k. pneumoniae and s. viridans (< or =3 cfus/ml), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. with s. marcescens (< 2 cfus/ml), only 7  of the 10 sets were reactive. with c. perfringens (0.2 cfus/ml), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. conclusions: this study evaluates the use of the bact/alert system for detection of bacteria in plt pools. overall, the bact/alert detected all contaminated pooled plts when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 cfus per ml with 10 different species of bacteria. low recovered concentrations (< or =2 cfus/ml) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.

TI  == current use of anti-infectives in dermatology.
AB  == dermatologic diseases encompass a broad category of pathologic situations. infection remains a significant aspect of the pathology faced in patient encounters, and it is natural to expect that anti-infectives play a major element in the armamentarium utilized by dermatologists. aside from the treatment of the  classic bacterial and fungal infections, there are now new uses for antiviral agents to help suppress recurrent disease, such as herpes simplex. there is also  the novel approach of using anti-infectives, or agents that have been thought to  have antimicrobial activity, to treat inflammatory diseases. this review describes anti-infectives, beginning with common antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections. the discussion will then cover the current use of antivirals. finally, the description of antifungals will be separated, starting with the oral agents and ending with the topical antimycotics. the use of anti-infectives in tropical dermatology has been purposefully left out, and perhaps should be the subject of a separate review. cutaneous bacterial infections consist chiefly of those microorganisms that colonize the skin, such as species of staphylococcus and streptococcus. propionibacterium acnes and certain other anaerobes can be involved in folliculitis, pyodermas and in chronic conditions such as hidradenitis suppurativa.

TI  == camp factor homologues in propionibacterium acnes: a new protein family differentially expressed by types i and ii.
AB  == analysis of the draft genome sequence of the opportunistic pathogen propionibacterium acnes type strain nctc 737 (=atcc 6919) revealed five genes with sequence identity to the co-haemolytic christie-atkins-munch-peterson (camp) factor of streptococcus agalactiae. the predicted molecular masses for the expressed proteins ranged from 28 to 30 kda. the genes were present in each of the three recently identified reca-based phylogenetic groupings of p. acnes (ia,  ib and ii), as assessed by pcr amplification. conserved differences in camp factor gene sequences between these three groups were also consistent with their  previous phylogenetic designations. all type ia, ib and ii isolates were positive for the co-haemolytic reaction on sheep blood agar. immunoblotting and silver staining of sds-page gels, however, revealed differential protein expression of camp factors amongst the different groups. type ib and ii isolates produced an abundance of camp factor 1, detectable by specific antibody labelling and silver  staining of sds-page gels. in contrast, abundant camp factor production was lacking in type ia isolates, although larger amounts of camp factor 2 were detectable by immunoblotting compared with type ii isolates. while the potential  role of the abundant camp factor 1 in host colonization or virulence remains to be determined, it should be noted that the type strain of p. acnes used in much of the published literature is a type ia isolate and is, therefore, lacking in this attribute.

TI  == single species biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates on gutta-percha points.
AB  == the participation of bacterial biofilms in the over-filled gutta-percha points associated with refractory periapical periodontitis has recently been reported. this study investigated the initial biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) on gutta-percha points in vitro. each bacterial strain was suspended in 100% cell culture medium or in culture medium containing 4.5, 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the bacterial suspensions were then co-incubated anaerobically with gutta-percha  points for 7 d. the gutta-percha points were processed for scanning electron microscopic observation and examined for biofilm presence and thickness. e. faecalis, strep. sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus biofilms were generated on the surfaces of the specimens incubated in culture medium supplemented with 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the e. faecalis and strep. sanguis biofilms were significantly thicker than those of strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus. no biofilms were detected on the specimens incubated with f. nucleatum, prop. acnes, porph. gingivalis and prev. intermedia. these findings suggest that gram-positive facultative anaerobes have the ability  to colonize and form extracellular matrices on gutta-percha points, while serum plays a crucial role in biofilm formation.

TI  == activity of nadifloxacin (opc-7251) and seven other antimicrobial agents against  aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria isolated from bacterial skin infections.
AB  == background and methods: the in vitro activity of nadifloxacin (opc-7251), a novel topical fluoroquinolone, was assessed and compared with those of ofloxacin, oxacillin, flucloxacillin, cefotiam, erythromycin, clindamycin, and gentamicin against 144 gram-positive bacteria: 28 staphylococcus aureus, 10 streptococcus spp., 68 coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), 36 propionibacterium acnes, and  2 propionibacterium granulosum strains. all strains originated from bacterial-infected skin disease and were isolated from patients with impetigo, secondary infected wounds, folliculitis and sycosis vulgaris, and impetiginized dermatitis. in vitro susceptibility of all clinical isolates was tested by agar dilution procedure and minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined.  results: nadifloxacin was active against all aerobic and anaerobic isolates. mic(90) (mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited) was 0.1 microg/ml for s. aureus, 0.78 microg/ml for both streptococcus spp. and cns, and 0.39 microg/ml for propionibacterium spp. on the other hand, resistant strains with mics exceeding 12.5 mug/ml were found in tests with the other antibiotics. for both cns and propionibacterium acnes, mic(90) values > or =100 microg/ml were demonstrated for erythromycin. ofloxacin, cefotiam, erythromycin, clindamycin and gentamicin exhibited mic(90) values < or =1 microg/ml for some bacterial species  tested. both oxacillin and flucloxacillin were active against all investigated bacterial species with mic(90) values < or =1 microg/ml. conclusion: in summary,  nadifloxacin, a topical fluoroquinolone, was found to be highly active against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria isolated from patients with infected skin disease, and seems to be a new alternative for topical antibiotic treatment in bacterial skin infections.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

AB  == background: bacterial detection of platelet (plt)-rich-plasma (prp)-derived plts  presents unique challenges for countries that do not allow pooling before storage. this study validated the bact/alert for use in testing pooled prp-derived plts with nine contaminating organisms. study design and methods: isolates of bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into two prp-derived plt pools (target, 10 and 100 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml; actual recovered concentrations, 5 and 90 cfus/ml). four milliliters of each postbacterial inoculation sample was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles and 0.5 ml was plated onto blood agar. results: all organisms (excluding p. acnes) were detected in 8.2 to 22.0 and 7.6 to 20.3 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively) and the mean time to detection was 15.0 and 13.1 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respective). p. acnes was detected with the anaerobic bottles in a mean of 74.9 and 64.3 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively). with e. cloacae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and s. viridans detection with the anaerobic bottles was faster or equivalent to the detection with the aerobic bottles. this was most notable with s. viridans where  the anaerobic bottle was reactive on average 21.6 and 10.8 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively) faster than the aerobic bottle. conclusions: this study validates the use of the bact/alert system for the detection of bacteria in prp-derived plts in a pooled format. overall, the use of the bact/alert system allowed the detection of pooled prp-derived plts inoculated with nine bacteria at 10 and 100 cfus per ml in 7.6 to 22.0 hours (excluding p. acnes).

TI  == endophthalmitis isolates and antibiotic sensitivities: a 6-year review of culture-proven cases.
AB  == purpose: to investigate the spectrum of organisms causing culture-proven endophthalmitis and their sensitivities to commonly used antimicrobial agents. design: retrospective, noncomparative, consecutive case series. methods: medical  records were reviewed of all patients with culture-proven endophthalmitis at a single institution between january 1, 1996, and december 31, 2001. endophthalmitis categories included postoperative, posttraumatic, endogenous, and miscellaneous (for example, keratitis). the outcome measures included intravitreal isolates identified, antibiotic sensitivities, and category of endophthalmitis. results: in all, 313 organisms were isolated from 278 patients during the study interval. the most common organisms identified were staphylococcus epidermidis in 27.8% (87/313), streptococcus viridans group in 12.8% (40/313), other coagulase-negative staphylococci in 9.3% (29/313), staphylococcus aureus in 7.7% (24/313), and propionibacterium acnes in 7.0% (22/313). overall, 246 of 313 (78.5%) isolates were gram-positive organisms, 37 (11.8%) were gram-negative organisms, and 27 (8.6%) were fungi. for gram-positive organisms, sensitivities were the following: vancomycin 100%, gentamicin 78.4%, ciprofloxacin 68.3%, ceftazidime 63.6%, and cefazolin 66.8%. for gram-negative organisms, sensitivities were the following: ciprofloxacin 94.2%, amikacin 80.9%, ceftazidime 80.0%, and gentamicin 75.0%. fungal isolates were candida species (9/313), aspergillus species (9/313), and other molds (9/313). among the endophthalmitis categories, the most frequent organisms were the following: (1) acute-onset postoperative: s epidermidis, 46.9%; (2) delayed-onset postoperative: s epidermidis, 22.7%; (3) delayed-onset bleb-associated: fastidious gram-negative rods, 20.4%; (4) posttraumatic: s epidermidis, 20.8%; (5) endogenous: aspergillus species, 20.8%; and (6) miscellaneous: molds (other), 36.4%. conclusions: in considering antibiotic treatment of endophthalmitis, it is important to recognize that no single antibiotic provided coverage for all of the microbes isolated from eyes with endophthalmitis. combination therapy is recommended as the initial empiric treatment of suspected bacterial endophthalmitis. appropriate history and characteristic clinical features may justify the use of initial antifungal agents. knowledge of the most frequent causative organisms in various categories  will help direct appropriate initial therapy.

TI  == multiple bacteria in aortic aneurysms.
AB  == objective: the purpose of the present study was to reexamine the possibility that bacteria, particularly anaerobes, are present in aortic aneurysms. methods: from  december 2000 to november 2001, 53 samples from aneurysm walls were collected from 49 patients during reconstructive surgery. the tissue specimens were sectioned and cultured under anaerobic conditions. twenty-eight specimens were also subjected to scanning or transmission electron microscopy. results: anaerobic cultivation yielded bacteria in 14 of the 53 samples (26.4%). all bacteria were gram-positive cocci or rods from nine genera and 12 species. five cultures (35%) were mixed, containing two bacterial species. mixed aerobic and anaerobic species were found in four samples (28.5%). anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 10 of 14 positive cultures (71%). among anaerobes found were propionibacterium acnes, propionibacterium granulosum, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, and eggerthella lenta. coaggregating bacteria of different sizes and structure were found on the aneurysm walls and inside the intravascular plaque at electron microscopy. bacteria were found in 20 of the 28  samples (71%) examined with scanning or transmission electron microscopy. conclusion: multiple bacteria, many of which did not belong to the indigenous skin microflora, colonize aortic aneurysms. it is not clear whether the bacteria  contribute to weakening of the aortic wall by eliciting inflammation or whether they are secondary colonizers of aneurysms.

TI  == severe infective keratitis leading to hospital admission in new zealand.
AB  == aim: to identify key risk factors and the management and outcome of severe infective keratitis leading to public hospital admission in new zealand. methods: over a 2 year period, all admissions of presumed infective keratitis to auckland  hospital were identified. the clinical records of all 103 cases were retrospectively reviewed with respect to clinical features, risk factors, management, and outcomes. results: the mean time from first symptoms or signs and presentation to hospital was 8.9 (sd 15.5) days. the majority of subjects, 88%, had at least one of the risk factors commonly associated with infective keratitis including previous ocular surgery (30%), contact lens wear (26%), topical corticosteroid use (25%), and ocular trauma (24%). corneal scraping was performed in 92% and of a total of 105 scrapes, 71% were positive. bacteria were isolated in all these cases, the majority being gram positive organisms (72%). the most common isolates identified were coagulase negative staphylococcus (16%), propionibacterium acnes (14%), staphylococcus epidermidis (11%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (9%). in addition, yeasts were isolated in 5%, fungi in  4%, virus in 2%, and chlamydia in 1%. importantly, polymicrobial infection accounted for 33% of culture positive cases. antimicrobial treatment was changed  on the basis of culture results in 17 cases (16.5%). median initial visual and final best corrected visual acuity was 6/36-6/48 (logmar 0.86) (iqr 0.39-2.00) and 6/12-6/15 (logmar 0.360) (iqr 0.15-1.70), respectively. previous ocular surgery and topical corticosteroid use were significantly associated with poorer  visual acuity. the mean hospital stay was 5.8 days and the median 4.0 (iqr 2.0-8.0) days. longer duration of stay was associated with the presence of hypopyon, larger ulcers, previous ocular surgery, and poor visual acuity. conclusions: infectious keratitis is an important cause of ocular morbidity. a significant proportion of cases have potentially modifiable risk factors. previous ocular surgery and topical corticosteroid use, in particular, were associated with poorer visual outcomes. many cases of severe keratitis might be avoided, or their severity reduced, by appropriate education of patients and ophthalmologists.

TI  == increased antimicrobial resistance in organisms recovered from otitis media with  effusion.
AB  == previous studies concerning the microbiology of otitis media with effusion (ome)  did not correlate the past use of antimicrobial agents with the recovered organism's antimicrobial susceptibility. a retrospective analysis of cultures obtained from aspirates of 129 children with ome was performed. the study identified the isolated organisms and determined their susceptibility to the most recently administered antimicrobials. bacterial growth was noted in 58 (45 per cent) patients. aerobic organisms only were recovered in 37 aspirates (63 per cent of the culture-positive aspirates); anaerobic bacteria in seven (12 per cent); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 14 (24 per cent). a total of 92 bacterial isolates were recovered, accounting for 1.6 isolates per specimen (1.1 aerobes and 0.5 anaerobes). there were a total of 66 aerobic isolates, including haemophilus influenzae non type-b (20 isolates), streptococcus pneumoniae (17), and staphylococcus spp. (seven). twenty-six anaerobes were recovered, including peptostreptococcus spp. and prevotella spp. (eight each) and propionibacterium acnes (four). resistance to the antimicrobial used was found in 60 (65 per cent) isolates, recovered from 41 (71 per cent) of the patients. of the 41 patients in whom resistance was detected, 37 (90 per cent) had been treated within three months of culture and four (10 per cent) had completed treatment more than three months before the cultures were taken (p < 0.01). the highest rate of recovery of resistant organisms was following trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (96 per cent), amoxycillin (71 per cent), and azithromycin (56 per cent). of the patients treated with amoxycillin, h influenzae predominated. s pneumoniae was recovered from four of the seven (57 per cent) after trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, four of 14 (29 per cent) following amoxycillin, and three of 11 (27 per cent) after azithromycin. the data illustrate the relationship between resistance to the antimicrobials given to children and their recovery from the middle ear of patients with ome.

AB  == the percent lipid composition of pooled human sebum analyzed by thin-layer chromatography was: ceramides (13%), fatty acid (47%), cholesterol (7%), cholesterol esters (2%), squalene (11%), triglycerides (3%), and wax esters (17%). total sebum lipids (2- 4 mg/ml), sonicated into bacterial culture medium,  caused 4- to 5-fold log reduction in growth of gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus salivarius and the anaerobe fusobacterium nucleatum, but was ineffective against most gram-negative bacteria. fractionation of the sebum lipids showed that both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids contained the bulk of the antimicrobial activity. lauric acid (c12:0) was the most active saturated fatty acid. the unsaturated fatty acid, palmitoleic acid (c16:1delta6, cpa) was both the most predominant monoene and the most active antimicrobial fatty acid. purified cpa (>99%) yielded typical minimal inhibitory  concentration (mic) values of 10-20 microg/ml against gram-positive bacteria. organically synthesized cpa isomer gave mic values comparable to the natural material. both natural and synthetic cpa were found to be the most active sebum lipid fraction in blocking the adherence of a pathogenic strain of candida albicans to porcine stratum corneum. ethanol in combination with cpa exerts a synergistic bactericidal activity against gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, propionibacterium acnes, escherichia coli, and  several methacillin-resistant strains of s. aureus. palmitoleic acid may be useful in topical formulations for treatment of secondary gram-positive bacterial infections, as a gram-positive bacteria antimicrobial in wound dressings, and as  a natural gram-positive antimicrobial preservative in skin and hair care products.

TI  == vitreous and aqueous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  == objective: to investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous and aqueous humor after oral administration. methods: a prospective, nonrandomized study of 24 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy between september 2001 and may 2002 at the cullen eye institute. aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 24 patients  after administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before the operation. assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. results: mean +/- sd gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 23), vitreous (n = 23), and aqueous (n = 11) were 5.14 +/- 1.36 micro g/ml, 1.34  +/- 0.34 micro g/ml, and 1.08 +/- 0.54 micro g/ml respectively. mean +/- sd sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 3.2 +/- 1.0 hours, 4.0 +/- 1.0 hours, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. the percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration  achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 26.17% and 21.02%, respectively. mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous mic(90 ) levels were achieved against many pathogens, including staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. conclusions: orally administered gatifloxacin achieves therapeutic levels in the noninflamed human eye, and the activity spectrum appropriately encompass the bacterial species most frequently involved in the various causes of endophthalmitis. because of its broad-spectrum coverage, low mic(90) levels for the organisms of concern, and good tolerability, gatifloxacin  represents a major advance in the prophylaxis or treatment of postoperative, posttraumatic, and bleb-associated bacterial endophthalmitis.

TI  == sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  == aims: to test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. methods: the bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 iu/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin b was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees c with five inocula of 14 bacteria. two yeasts  (candida spp) and one aspergillus were also tested. contaminated media were then  inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened  daily by visual inspection. the sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. results: organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria  irrespective of the starting inoculums: streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, and haemophilus influenzae. for micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal  only (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, candida kruzei, aspergillus  fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (sd 13.8, range 2-52). in cases of detection by the  blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. conclusions: blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  == background: retinoids such as retinoic acid (ra), retinol (rol) and retinaldehyde (ral) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. aim: to analyse the potential anti-infective  activities of topical rol, ral and ra. methods: microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of rol, ral and ra were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus flavus, propionibacterium acnes, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus hominis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant s. aureus, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, streptococcus group b, enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and pseudomonas/klebsiella. in two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% ral or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% ral or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. results: of the three retinoids tested, only ral showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like s. aeureus, micrococcus spp. or  p. acnes. no activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. these results on  reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. mic(50) and mic(90) values for ral were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant s. aureus. the two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with ral had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. in the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2)  for p. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. no resistant bacteria were  found after 2 weeks of topical use. preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of ral is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. conclusion: we have shown that ral differs from parent natural retinoids such as rol and ra in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. this activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the  potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.

TI  == evaluation of a new generation of culture bottle using an automated bacterial culture system for detecting nine common contaminating organisms found in platelet components.
AB  == background: an automated bacterial culture system (bact/alert 3d, biomerieux) has been previously validated with a variety of bacteria in platelets. the recovery of bacteria in platelets using a new generation of culture bottles that do not require venting and that use a liquid emulsion sensor was studied. study design and methods: bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella  oxytoca, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens,  streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes isolates were inoculated into day 2 platelets to concentrations of 10 and 100 cfu per ml. samples were then studied with current and new aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles. results:  all organisms, except p. acnes, were detected in a mean time of 9.2 to 20.4 (10 cfu/ml) or 8.7 to 18.6 (100 cfu/ml) hours. p. acnes was detected in a mean time of 69.2 (10 cfu/ml) or 66.0 (100 cfu/ml) hours. the 10-fold increase in inoculum  was associated with a mean 9.2 percent difference in detection time. the aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles had a mean difference in detection time (hours)  between the current and new bottles of 0.10 (p=0.61), 0.4 (p=0.38), and 1.0 (p <  0.001), respectively. conclusion: no difference in detection time between the current and new aerobic and anaerobic bottles was demonstrated. the new pediatric bottles had a small but significant delay in detection.

TI  == prevalent bacterial species and novel phylotypes in advanced noma lesions.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the bacterial diversity in advanced noma lesions using culture-independent molecular methods. 16s ribosomal dna bacterial genes from dna isolated from advanced noma lesions of four nigerian children were pcr amplified with universally conserved primers and spirochetal selective primers and cloned into escherichia coli. partial 16s rrna sequences of approximately 500 bases from 212 cloned inserts were used initially to determine  species identity or closest relatives by comparison with sequences of known species or phylotypes. nearly complete sequences of approximately 1,500 bases were obtained for most of the potentially novel species. a total of 67 bacterial  species or phylotypes were detected, 25 of which have not yet been grown in vitro. nineteen of the species or phylotypes, including propionibacterium acnes,  staphylococcus spp., and the opportunistic pathogens stenotrophomonas maltophilia and ochrobactrum anthropi were detected in more than one subject. other known species that were detected included achromobacter spp., afipia spp., brevundimonas diminuta, capnocytophaga spp., cardiobacterium sp., eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium spp., gemella haemoylsans, and neisseria spp. phylotypes that were unique to noma infections included those in the genera eubacterium, flavobacterium, kocuria, microbacterium, and porphyromonas and the related streptococcus salivarius and genera sphingomonas and treponema: since advanced noma lesions are infections open to the environment, it was not surprising to detect species not commonly associated with the oral cavity, e.g., from soil. several species previously implicated as putative pathogens of noma, such as spirochetes and fusobacterium spp., were detected in at least one subject. however, due to the limited number of available noma subjects, it was not possible at this time to associate specific species with the disease.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of t-3912, a novel non-fluorinated topical quinolone.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo activity of t-3912, a novel non-fluorinated topical quinolone, was compared with that of nadifloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin and gentamicin. the in vitro activity of t-3912 against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, ofloxacin-resistant and methicillin-resistant s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, ofloxacin-resistant  s. epidermidis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and propionibacterium acnes was four-fold to 16 000-fold greater than that of other agents at the mic90 for the clinical isolates. the activity of t-3912 was not influenced by grla mutation in s. aureus, and the degree of mic increase of t-3912 for grla-gyra double and triple mutants was lowest among the quinolones tested (nadifloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin). the inhibitory activity of t-3912 was compared with other quinolones for dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv of  s. aureus sa113. t-3912 showed the greatest inhibitory activity for both enzymes  among the quinolones tested. the isolation frequency of spontaneous mutants resistant to t-3912 was < 1.7 x 10(-9) and < 2.0 x 10(-9) for s. aureus sa113 and p. acnes jcm 6425, respectively. furthermore, resistance to t-3912 could not be clearly detected in the 28th transfer by the serial passage method. t-3912 exhibited more potent bactericidal activity against s. aureus and p. acnes than nadifloxacin and clindamycin in a short time period. t-3912 in a 1% gel formulation showed good therapeutic activity against a burn infection model caused by s. aureus sa113, p. acnes jcm6425 and multidrug-resistant s. aureus f-2161. these results indicate that t-3912 is potentially a useful quinolone for  the treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections and that its potent bactericidal activity might be able to shorten the treatment period.

TI  == [mechanisms behind the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria].
AB  == background: bacterial resistance to antibiotics is an increasing threat to the successful treatment of hospital and community-acquired infections. material and  methods: based on relevant literature, this article focuses on some of the essential resistance problems caused by pathogens such as pneumococci, staphylocci, enterococci and gram-negative rods, and provides a review of the genetic and molecular basis of bacterial resistance, as well as of the global trends in bacterial resistance. results: mechanisms of resistance continue to evolve and disseminate among gram-negative as well as gram-positive pathogens. new problems are developing, such as glycopeptide resistance in staphylococcus aureus. bacteria have become resistant to antibiotics as a result of chromosomal  changes or the exchange of genetic material via plasmids and transposons. the emergence of multiresistant bacteria e.g. s. aureus, enterococci and mycobacterium tuberculosis, has made many currently available antibiotics ineffective. interpretation: the introduction of new antibiotics has always been  followed by development of resistance.

TI  == evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrite on dermatophyte fungi, candida and bacterial skin pathogens.
AB  == aims: nitric oxide is generated from sweat nitrite in the acidic environment of the skin surface and is thought to contribute to protection against infection. this study examined the sensitivity of trichophyton mentagrophytes, t. rubrum, candida albicans, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus and propionibacterium acnes to acidified nitrite. methods and results: organisms were cultured in varying concentrations of nitrite and ph for different lengths of time, before being transferred to recovery medium. with the exception of strep. pyogenes, addition of nitrite increased the antimicrobial activity of acid solutions against all organisms tested. the rank order of sensitivity was: c. albicans < t. rubrum < t. mentagrophytes < staph. aureus < p. acnes, with p. acnes being most sensitive. conclusion: this work has shown that acidified nitrite is microbiocidal to common cutaneous pathogens. the concentrations of nitrite required to kill pathogenic fungi and bacteria in in vitro assays were higher than the concentrations of nitrite measured in sweat. however, additional  co-factors in vivo and in sweat may potentiate the effect of acidified nitrite. significance and impact of the study: pharmacological preparations of acidified nitrite are novel antimicrobial agents. these data suggest skin organisms which may be sensitive to this treatment.

TI  == killing of cutaneous microbial species by photodynamic therapy.
AB  == background: photodynamic therapy (pdt) utilizes photosensitizers and light. whereas pdt use in cancer treatment has been widely accepted, antimicrobial pdt (apdt) is still in its early stages of development. objectives: to study microbial killing in vitro using apdt. methods: we used a combination of methylene blue and visible light, and a range of microbial species representative of those encountered on the skin in health and disease. using standard light intensity conditions (slide projector, 25 cm distance from target, 42 mw cm(-2))  and methylene blue dye at 100 microg ml(-1), kill rates and subsequent d-values were determined against staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, corynebacterium minutissimum, propionibacterium acnes and candida albicans. results: d-values for these species were 72, 66, 48, 120, 30 and 660 s, respectively. the effects of light intensity on the killing of s. epidermidis showed the kill rate to be proportional to the light intensity. a high rate of cell kill was also obtained using natural sunlight. conclusions: overall, these results indicate that apdt of the skin may represent a useful alternative to conventional antimicrobial treatment.

TI  == assessment of periradicular microbiota by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == in the present study the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. in group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. the gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. bacterial dna was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. the mean number (+/- sd) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in group 2 (p < 0.001). the majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from group 1 than from group 2. the differences were most notable for campylobacter gracilis, porphyromonas endodontalis, propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, streptococcus constellatus and actinomyces naeslundii i. bacterial species such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. also, p. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. the data supported the idea that  following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. the study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. the detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.

TI  == red light kills bacteria via photodynamic action.
AB  == with the increase in the number of antibiotic resistant strains of microorganism, the search for alternative treatments of microbial infections becomes all the more important. we report a novel method for bacterial inactivation based on the  optical excitation of the naturally occurring (endogenous) photosensitzing porphyrins by red light. in particular, the pathogenic gram-positive porphyrin producing atcc strains propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces odontolyticus and porphyromonas gingivalis were investigated. sensitive autofluorescence spectroscopy revealed that these bacteria naturally synthezise the fluorescent photosensitizer protoporphyrin ix. in addition, bacterial plaque samples of periodontitis patients were studied. non-labeled fluorescent bacterial colonies were exposed to red light at 632.8 nm, 100 mw/cm2 light intensity and 360 j/cm2 energy density using a helium-neon laser. the survival rate after a single phototreatment with red light was found to be 0.58 +/- 0.09 in the case of propionibacterium acnes, 0.30 +/- 0.04 in actinomyces odontolyticus and 0.59 +/-  0.10 in porphyrormonas gingivalis compared to non-exposed bacteria suspensions. no photoeffect was found for the bacterium streptococcus mutans which exhibited no detectable porphyrin autofluorescence. red-light exposed plaque samples of patients showed significant reduction of colony forming units by 50% as well as a pronounced photoeffect on the pigmented species prevotella intermedia. taken together, these results suggest the treatment with red light can be potentially employed as an therapeutic method to inactivate certain pathogenic strains of porphyrin producing bacteria without the use of external photosensitizers.

TI  == [in vitro activities of levofloxacin and other antibiotics against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == in this study, the in vitro activity of levofloxacin (lvfx) against 1,020 fresh bacterial clinical isolates was compared with the activities of a range of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin (cpfx), ampicillin (abpc), cefaclor, cefpodoxime, methicillin and benzylpenicillin. the clinical isolates except vibrio cholerae were collected in japan during 1998 from patients with infectious diseases. mics  were determined using the agar dilution method according to the recommendations by the japan society of chemotherapy. some isolates of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and coagulase negative staphylococcus were resistant to fluoroquinolones, but the mic50 of lvfx against mrsa was 6.25 micrograms/ml. lvfx was the most active against mrsa among the antibiotics tested. most of staphylococcus epidermidis strains were susceptible to the fluoroquinolones. lvfx showed greater activity against all streptococci strains compared with fluoroquinolones tested. in particular, all streptococcus pneumoniae strains including prsp were susceptible to lvfx at < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml. among enterococcus, abpc showed superior activity against enterococcus faecalis but many isolates of enterococcus species were resistant to abpc. lvfx was more active against to these enterococcus species compared with other fluoroquinolones. on the other hand, lvfx and cpfx showed similar activity against isolates of enterobacteriaceae. cpfx had an mic50/90 of 0.20, 0.39 microgram/ml and lvfx showed an mic50/90 of 0.78, 1.56 micrograms/ml against pseudomonas aeruginosa. lvfx (mic50/90 0.10, 0.20 microgram/ml) was more active against acinetobacter species than cpfx (mic50/90 0.10, 0.39 microgram/ml). haemophilus influenzae, branhamella (moraxella) catarrhalis and v. cholerae were  inhibited by low concentration of the fluoroquinolones tested. the mic90 of lvfx  and cpfx were < or = 0.10 microgram/ml against above three species. some isolates of neisseria gonorrhoeae and campylobacter species were moderately resistant to the fluoroquinolones tested but the mic50 of lvfx and cpfx were < or = 0.39 microgram/ml. among anaerobes, propionibacterium acnes was more susceptible than  peptostreptococcus species, and the mic90 of beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones tested were < or = 0.78 microgram/ml. in conclusion, this study, performed on large number of strains, confirmed an excellent and wide spectrum antibacterial activity of lvfx compared with the fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams tested. and  our results suggest that lvfx may be useful in the treatment of various bacterial infections.

AB  == thirteen teeth with necrotic pulps and apical periodontitis and nine severe periodontal pockets were cultured for presence of beta-hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms. samples were dispersed and plated on two non-selective and one selective growth media and incubated anaerobically and in 10% co2 in air. a total of 59 beta-hemolytic colonies were purified and identified. eight beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates were obtained from three  of the severe marginal periodontitis sites. all were identified as belonging to the streptococcus sanguis group. no beta-hemolytic streptococci were detected in  apical periodontitis samples. twenty obligately anaerobic isolates were detected, all of which were known periodontal and endodontic pathogens. isolates from apical periodontitis sites were identified as propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces naeslundii, actionomyces odontolyticus and peptostreptococcus micros, while severe marginal periodontal sites contained the same species with the addition of actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces meyeri. of 19 staphylococci and  micrococci, staphylococcus epidermidis was the predominant isolate in both apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis sites. however, less commonly known organisms such as staphylococcus cohnii and micrococcus sp. were identified in severe marginal periodontitis sites. the isolation of bacillus sp. (12 isolates) in one severe marginal periodontitis and two apical periodontitis subjects was especially interesting, warranting consideration of this organism as a legitimate isolate and potential pathogen in oral disease.

TI  == [bacterial keratitis. microbiological analysis as a principle for therapeutic recommendations].
AB  == purpose: the study presented differentiates between the aetiological agents of bacterial keratitis in patients with and without a history of contact lens wear.  based on these results, recommendations are given for optimal antibiotic primary  therapy. patients and methods: swabs and corneal scrapings were taken from 218 patients referred to the university eye hospital in munich with a diagnosis of bacterial keratitis from 1989 to 1997. ninety-two of these patients had a history of contact lens wear; 126 had none. the germs were isolated and identified by staining and microscopy. observing polymicrobial growth in 51 patients, a total of 275 germs was isolated. results: the most frequent pathogens were staphylococcus epidermidis (44%), s. aureus (18%), streptococcus spp. (10%), propionibacterium acnes (7%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%). gram-negative germs were nearly exclusively isolated from contact lens wearers, gram-positive germs were predominant in non-contact lens wearers. conclusion: keratitis in patients with a history of contact lens wear is often caused by aggressive gram-negative germs. those cases should immediately be treated with quinolones and erythromycin. in keratitis caused by gram-positive pathogens, a combination with  aminoglycosides and erythromycin is sufficient.

TI  == [bacterial keratitis in patients with and without contact lens anamnesis].
AB  == background: the study shows differences between contact lens wearers and patients without history of contact lenses regarding the spectrum of etiological agents in bacterial keratitis. based on microbiological analysis, there are given recommendations for an optimal initial antibiotic treatment in both groups. material and methods: from 1989 to 1997 smears, scrapings and corneal biopsies were taken from 218 patients with bacterial keratitis. the causing pathogens were isolated on directly inoculated culture media and identified by staining and microscopy. the resistance pattern of a total of 275 germs was analysed for different antibiotics. results: the most frequently isolated germs were staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus spp., propionibacterium acnes and pseudomonas aeruginosa. whereas sensitive gram-positive germs were predominating in contact lens wearers as well as in non-contact lens wearers, multiresistant gram-negative germs could nearly exclusively be isolated from contact lens wearers. frequently administered antibiotics like aminoglycosides and quinolones are effective in infections caused by staphylococcus spp., but increasing resistance could be seen to streptococcus spp. in this case, erythromycin is very sensitive. gram-negative germs like pseudomonas aeruginosa are sensitive to quinolones and some aminoglycosides (e.g. tobramycin). conclusion: in contact lens wearers, more aggressive germs have to be considered than in non-contact lens wearers. in such  cases, frequently administered antibiotics like amino-glycosides are not effective. to cover problematic gram-negative germs we recommend the application  of quinolones alternating with erythromycin. the latter one is more effective than quinolones and aminoglycosides in case of streptococcus spp. co-involvement.

TI  == bacteriostatic effects of hyaluronic acid.
AB  == background: this investigation is one of a series of projects seeking to ascertain whether hyaluronic acid (ha) is therapeutically effective in tissue regeneration procedures. the rationale for these investigations is to test the hypothesis that ha can serve as a bioabsorbable carrier for other substrates as well as itself actively promote the regeneration of tissue. methods: in this paper, we report on the bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties of 3 molecular weight formulations of recombinant ha (low, 141 kd; medium, 757 kd; and high, 1,300 kd) on selected oral and non-oral microorganisms in the planktonic phase. three concentrations of each ha formulation were screened, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/ml, using a standard broth culture assay. results: recombinant ha exerted varied bacteriostatic effects on all the bacterial strains tested depending on its molecular weight (mw) and concentration. the high concentrations of the medium mw ha had the greatest bacteriostatic effect, particularly on the actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella oris, staphylococcus aureus, and propionibacterium acnes strains. the 1.0 mg/ml concentration of high mw ha had the greatest overall bacteriostatic effect, inhibiting the growth of all 6 bacterial strains tested. among the bacterial strains studied, ha was found to have no bactericidal effects, regardless of concentration or molecular weight. conclusions: the results of this study suggest that ha in the mw range of 1,300 kd may prove beneficial in minimizing bacterial contamination of surgical wounds  when used in guided tissue regeneration surgery.

TI  == bacterial eradication from root dentine by ultrasonic irrigation with sodium hypochlorite.
AB  == the study aimed to evaluate intracanal irrigation procedures in eradicating bacteria from surface, shallow and deep layers of root dentine using extracted human teeth. artificial bacterial smear layer was successfully produced by rubbing a mixture of dental plaque and artificially decalcified dentine or carious dentine on root canal walls. the reservoir holes were 3.5 mm in depth, 1  mm in diameter prepared 1.5 mm apart and parallel to the root canals on the decrowned planes, in which five separate bacterial species were placed (actinomyces israelii, fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis). bacterial eradication after irrigation of the prepared canals was determined by bacterial recovery (i) from the root canal surfaces and shallow layers where bacteria were smeared artificially and (ii) from deeper layers of root canal dentine reservoir holes. ultrasonic irrigation with 5.5% and 12% naocl eradicated bacteria from artificial smear layer (p < 0.0001), whilst 12% naocl irrigation with a syringe was insufficient. ultrasonic irrigation with water or 15% edta-failed to eradicate bacteria from smeared surfaces. ultrasonic irrigation with 12% naocl killed a. israelii, f. nucleatum, p. acnes, s. mutans, and s. sanguis placed in reservoir channels, although for f. nucleatum, a very small number of bacteria remained in  five samples out of 12. ultrasonic irrigation with less concentrated naocl failed to eliminate bacteria completely from reservoir channels in most samples. ultrasonic irrigation with 12% naocl appeared to eliminate bacteria efficiently from surface, shallow and deep layers of root dentine.

TI  == prevalence and identity of translocating bacteria in healthy dogs.
AB  == bacterial translocation is characterized by the passage of intestinally derived bacteria across the intestinal mucosa to local or regional tissues. this phenomenon is believed to be important in the pathogenesis of gram-negative bacteremia and septicemia; however, the pathway or route of translocation remains unclear. to define the route of translocation better, mesenteric lymph nodes from 50 apparently healthy dogs undergoing elective ovariohysterectomies were cultured aerobically and anaerobically. the aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of bacterial translocation and to quantify and identify types of organisms found in mesenteric lymph nodes. peripheral blood and portal blood samples were similarly cultured to rule out hematogenous organisms as a source of lymph node contamination. bacteria were isolated from mesenteric lymph nodes of 26 dogs (52%). the number of bacteria varied from 50 to > 10(5) organisms/g of tissue. bacteria isolated included staphylococcus intermedius (n = 3), coagulase-negative staphylococcus (n = 2), nonhemolytic streptococcus (n = 4), bacillus species (n = 5), escherichia coli (n = 6), salmonella species (n = 3), pseudomonas species (n = 2), enterococcus species (n = 2), clostridium sordelli (n = 1), micrococcus species (n = 1), lactobacillus species (n = 1), and propionibacterium acnes (n = 1). one of 50 peripheral blood samples yielded an unidentified gram-positive coccus and a coagulase-negative staphylococcus. no bacteria were isolated from portal blood samples of any dog. further studies of this type on sick dogs are warranted before clinical recommendations can be made  to culture mesenteric lymph nodes routinely.

TI  == colonic perforation by ventriculoperitoneal shunt tubing: a case of suspected silicone allergy.
AB  == background: a case of colonic perforation by a ventriculoperitoneal shunt is presented in a patient with several previous complications associated with shunt  tubing. case description: initially managed by intravenous antibiotics, shunt externalization, and colonoscopy, the entire ventriculoperitoneal shunt system was subsequently replaced after cerebrospinal fluid cultures had grown propionibacterium acnes and streptococcus sanguis organisms. the patient has had  three episodes of skin breakdown over his shunt tubing (two prior and one subsequent to colonic perforation) without evidence of shunt infection or malfunction. conclusions: the etiology of these complications is consistent with  silicone tubing allergy. replacement with a polyurethane system produced no similar complications thus far, which further supports a possible silicone allergy to the ventriculoperitoneal shunt and possible etiology of this patient's colonic perforation.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

TI  == ribotyping of bacteria from root canal and blood of patients receiving endodontic therapy.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of the hyaluronate lyase gene from propionibacterium acnes.
AB  == the hyaluronate lyase (hyaluronidase) gene from propionibacterium acnes was cloned and sequenced. the gene was isolated on an ecori-generated 3-kb piece of dna. expression was less in escherichia coli than in p. acnes; in e. coli, active enzyme was only cell associated and not secreted. the gene is 2256-pb long and codes for a protein of 82 kda. amino terminal sequencing of the protein of the partially purified gene indicated the presence of a 32-amino-acid leader sequence. the leader sequence showed a membrane-spanning domain and all of the features usually associated with the leader for a secreted protein. the amino acid sequence is predicted to share homology with the hyaluronidase enzymes from  streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococcus aureus. a  potential hyaluronate-binding domain was identified and antibody against this domain was inhibitory to the enzyme.

TI  == identification and antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from periapical lesions.
AB  == periradicular tissues from 28 refractory endodontic cases requiring surgical intervention were submitted for histological diagnosis and microbiological culture. bacteria isolated from these lesions were identified and then tested for their antibiotic sensitivity to a panel of common antibiotics. the periapical tissue specimens of 22 out of 28 lesions (79%) contained microorganisms. of the 22 cases showing positive growth cultures, 15 were polymicrobial and 7 were single species isolates. fifty-three different species were recovered: 29 anaerobes, 19 facultative anaerobes, and 5 aerobes. microbes were observed under  light microscopy in only one case. the most common organisms isolated were propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus intermedius, wolinella recta, fusobacterium species, and clostridium species. antibiotic susceptibility results showed no clear cut evidence of significant antibiotic resistance among the species tested. the results of this study seem to corroborate earlier studies regarding the microbial population of periapical lesions refractory to nonsurgical endodontics.

TI  == electrophoresis of whole-cell soluble proteins of microorganisms isolated from bacteremias in endodontic therapy.
AB  == we have previously demonstrated that anaerobic bacteria are the microorganisms most frequently isolated from blood following endodontic therapy of teeth with apical periodontitis. phenotypic characterisation of the isolates suggested that  the bacteria in the blood originated from the root canal. the present experiment  using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) was carried out in an effort to verify these findings, and to further study the microorganisms involved in endodontic bacteremias. soluble cellular proteins were extracted from 11 reference strains and 26 bacterial isolates recovered from the  root canal and blood. these included propionibacterium acnes, peptostreptococcus  prevotii, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia. actinomyces israelii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus sanguis. the electrophoretic patterns mostly confirmed the identity of the isolates as determined by the biochemical and antimicrobial resistance tests. furthermore, with this typing method the species prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens could be differentiated.  these species had been recovered from both root canal and blood. also, differences between subspecies of fusobacterium nucleatum became evident with sds-page, and the results indicated that the organism recovered from the root canal and blood was fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincentii. the electrophoretic patterns of the different organisms isolated from the root canal and the blood were similar, providing further evidence that the bacteria found in the blood originated from the root canal.

TI  == use of fura-2/am to measure intracellular free calcium in selenomonas ruminantium.
AB  == this paper describes a procedure for loading the acetoxymethyl ester of fura-2 (fura-2/am), and the subsequent measurement of the concentration of intracellular free ca2+ ([ca2+]i) in selenomonas ruminantium (s. ruminantium) using this technique. to ascertain the optimal loading conditions, the effect was examined on the loading of fura-2/am of ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (edta), lysozyme, pluronic f127 alone, or the simultaneous application of edta and pluronic f127. individual administration of either edta, lysozyme or pluronic f127 did not produce an optimal loading of fura-2/ am. the co-application of pluronic f127 and bovine serum albumin after treatment with edta increased the ratio of the fluorescence due to excitation at 340 nm to that at 380 nm (r340/380) markedly, with a high signal intensity for intracellular fura-2, indicating that adequate loading had been obtained. using the present loading method, it was found that the resting free [ca2+]i of s. ruminantium was 48.1 +/- 2.2 nm (n = 6). this is approximately one half that found in escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, streptococcus bovis and eucaryote cells. this is the first measurement of free [ca2+]i using fura-2/am in the gram-negative strict anaerobe s. ruminantium.

TI  == distribution of thiols in microorganisms: mycothiol is a major thiol in most actinomycetes.
AB  == mycothiol [2-(n-acetylcysteinyl)amido-2-deoxy-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl- (1-->1)-myo-inositol] (msh) has recently been identified as a major thiol in a number of actinomycetes (s. sakuda, z.-y. zhou, and y. yamada, biosci. biotech. biochem. 58:1347-1348, 1994; h. s. c. spies and d. j. steenkamp, eur. j. biochem. 224:203-213, 1994; and g. l. newton, c. a. bewley, t. j. dwyer, r. horn, y. aharonowitz, g. cohen, j. davies, d. j. faulkner, and r. c. fahey, eur. j. biochem. 230:821-825, 1995). since this novel thiol is more resistant than glutathione to heavy-metal ion-catalyzed oxidation, it seems likely to be the antioxidant thiol used by aerobic gram-positive bacteria that do not produce glutathione (gsh). in the present study we sought to define the spectrum of organisms that produce msh. gsh was absent in all actinomycetes and some of the other gram-positive bacteria studied. surprisingly, the streptococci and enterococci contained gsh, and some strains appeared to synthesize it rather than import it from the growth medium. msh was found at significant levels in most actinomycetes examined. among the actinobacteria four micrococcus species produced msh, but msh was not found in representatives of the arthrobacter, agromyces, or actinomyces genera. of the nocardioforms examined, nocardia, rhodococcus, and mycobacteria spp. all produced msh. in addition to the established production of msh by streptomycetes, we found that micromonospora, actinomadura, and nocardiopsis spp. also synthesized msh. mycothiol production was not detected in propionibacterium acnes or in representative species of the listeria, staphylococcus, streptococcus, enterococcus, bacillus, and clostridium  genera. examination of representatives of the cyanobacteria, purple bacteria, and spirochetes also gave negative results, as did tests of rat liver, bonito, candida albicans, neurospora crassa, and spinach leaves. the results, which indicate that msh production is restricted to the actinomycetes, could have significant implications for the detection and treatment of infections with actinomycetes, especially those caused by mycobacteria.

TI  == intraocular lens removal from eyes with chronic low-grade endophthalmitis.
AB  == intraocular lenses (iols) were removed from 11 eyes with chronic low-grade endophthalmitis after cataract extraction to restore useful vision and prevent recurrence. one anterior chamber lens, one iris-supported lens, and nine posterior chamber lenses were removed. in the eyes with posterior chamber lenses, the posterior capsule was intact; total (n = 7) or partial (n = 2) capsulectomy was performed in these eyes. aqueous humor specimens obtained at surgery were positive for bacteria in five eyes, but scanning electron microscopy showed bacteria on all removed iols and capsular bags. final best corrected visual acuity was 20/40 or better in seven eyes. reduced visual acuity, between 20/50 and 20/400 in three eyes and counting fingers in one eye, was related to retinal  detachment (n = 2) and age-related macular degeneration (n = 2). transient hyphema was seen in one eye. with a mean follow-up of 21 months (range 10 to 31 months), no recurrence of inflammation was observed. the results show that negative cultures do not preclude a bacterial cause for infection and that primary iol removal with partial or total capsulectomy provides a surgical approach to the treatment of chronic low-grade endophthalmitis not responsive to  medical therapy.

TI  == persistent endophthalmitis after intravitreal antimicrobial therapy.
AB  == purpose: to assess the frequency of persistent infection after injection of intravitreal antimicrobials as therapy for endophthalmitis and to determine if persistent infection influences the final visual outcome after treatment. methods: in a series of 42 eyes with culture-positive endophthalmitis of various  types, the authors performed a second vitreous culture and injection of antimicrobial agents in 22 eyes. repeat cultures were obtained 3 to 8 days after  initial therapy in 20 of the 22 eyes. results: twelve of the 22 eyes were persistently culture-positive. organisms identified in the persistently culture-positive eyes included staphylococcal species (n = 4), streptococcus (n = 4), serratia (n = 1), propionibacterium acnes (n = 1), and fungi (n = 2). eyes in which the initial antimicrobial therapy failed to eradicate a bacterial infection had a worse outcome than those that were culture-negative on repeat sampling. final visual acuity of 20/200 or better after repeat injection was attained in 4  of the 12 culture-positive eyes. conclusion: a single injection of intravitreal antimicrobial agents may be insufficient to cure some cases of endophthalmitis, and a second injection should be considered in some circumstances.

AB  == comparison was made between the immunobiological and antigenic properties of two  lipoteichoic acid (lta) fractions (lta-1 and -2) from enterococcus hirae atcc 9790, their glycolipid portions, and synthetic compounds partially mimicking the  above bacterial products. the more lipophilic lta-2 fraction was capable of inducing serum tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6 in muramyldipeptide-primed mice and serum gamma interferon in those primed with propionibacterium acnes. the lta-2 fraction also induced tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, and thymocyte-activating factor (essentially interleukin-1) in murine peritoneal macrophage cultures. consecutive intravenous injections of muramyldipeptide and the lta-2 fraction in meth a fibrosarcoma-bearing balb/c mice caused hemorrhagic necrosis and marked regression leading to complete regression of the tumor with no accompanying weakening or lethal effects. the lta-2 fraction was at least 10,000-fold less pyrogenic in rabbits than a reference endotoxic lipopolysaccharide. the more hydrophilic lta-1 fraction, on the other hand, showed at most marginal activity in the in vivo and in vitro assays. natural glycolipids (ngl-1 and -2) which were prepared from a chloroform-methanol extract of streptococcus pyogenes and e. hirae cells, and comparable in structure to the lipid moieties of the lta-1 and -2 fractions, respectively, were practically inactive in all of the assays. none of the test synthetic compounds was immunobiologically active, although synthetic partial counterparts of the structure of lta proposed by w. fischer (handb. lipid res. 6:123-234, 1990) reacted with murine monoclonal antibody ts-2, which was raised against ok-432, a penicillin-killed s. pyogenes preparation, and capable of neutralizing the cytokine-inducing activities of the lta-2 fraction.

TI  == efficacy and safety of gentamicin and streptomycin in optisol-gs, a preservation  medium for donor corneas.
AB  == increasing reports of gentamicin-resistant bacteria contaminating donor corneas and causing endophthalmitis have indicated that preservation of corneal storage media with 100 micrograms/ml of gentamicin alone needs reevaluation. we investigated the stability and possible cytotoxicity of streptomycin as a supplement to gentamicin in optisol corneal storage medium. the combination of gentamicin and streptomycin in optisol solution was stable at room temperature for at least 4 weeks and inhibited the growth of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, alpha hemolytic streptococci, streptococcus group d, propionibacterium acnes, escherichia coli, and diphtheroids, but not pseudomonas  aeruginosa. the addition of vancomycin did not significantly improve the antibacterial effectiveness of the gentamicin and streptomycin combination when stored at 4 degrees c. the growth of 15 of 20 clinical ocular isolates of ps. aeruginosa was suppressed by the gentamicin-streptomycin combination. streptomycin in concentrations of up to 1,000 micrograms/ml did not decrease the  mitotic activity of corneal endothelial cells as evaluated by the in vitro incorporation of tritiated thymidine or cause cytotoxicity. the addition of 200 micrograms/ml of streptomycin to optisol corneal storage medium containing 100 micrograms/ml of gentamicin may significantly improve activity against gentamicin-sensitive and gentamicin-resistant contaminants.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of cefuroxime against recent clinical isolates].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of cefuroxime axetil (cxm-ax) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains obtained mainly from outpatients of our center in a period from january to september of 1990 and 1993. minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined and the following results were  obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic80 of cxm were equal to or lower against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, peptostreptococcus spp., and propionibacterium acnes, except for streptococcus pneumoniae, mic80 which was slightly higher. 2. mic90 of comparator drugs reflected those of new resistant organisms recently appeared, such as benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephem-resistant e. coli and klebsiella spp., new quinolone-resistant h. influenzae and n. gonorrhoeae. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was detected also from specimens of community acquired infections. from the nature of mrsa detected in those situations mrsa appeared to present a continuing problem. 3. mic90 against strains obtained from  patients with community acquired infections was a good index of increases of multidrug-resistant organisms in the past. therefore, the determination of mic90  is important in examining changes with time of sensitivities or resistances of clinically isolated strains to antimicrobial drugs. 4. antimicrobial activities of cxm against recent clinical isolates showed the existence of problems as mentioned above. however, mic of cxm as well as those of comparator drugs indicated that antimicrobial activities of cxm against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., h. influenzae appeared to be relatively strong, and it is concluded that cefuroxime axetil still is one of the clinically useful oral antimicrobial drugs in the 1990's.

TI  == a quantitative comparison of selected bacteria in human carious dentine by microscopic counts.
AB  == the levels of selected cariogenic and obligately anaerobic bacteria have been compared in carious dentine taken from fissures, smooth surfaces, and root surfaces. the numbers of infected dentinal tubules were determined by immunohistological staining using species-specific antisera against selected bacteria. selective localization was observed; mutans streptococci were the predominant bacteria in dentine from fissures and smooth surface coronal caries,  but not from root surface caries. the proportion of mutans streptococci was higher in the shallow and middle layers of dentine from fissures and smooth surface coronal carious lesions than from the deep layers. in root surface caries, actinomyces spp. were the predominant bacteria, and were present at higher levels in the deep layer of root lesions than in the shallow and middle layers. the proportion of lactobacillus spp. was relatively low despite its high  detection frequency in all layers of the three types of carious lesion. immunohistological staining with species-specific antisera was able to reveal the distribution and the localization of various bacteria in carious dentine.

AB  == during an etiological study of kawasaki disease (mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome [mcls]), we found that dominant viridans streptococcal strains on tooth  surfaces and in the throat of both mcls patients and non-mcls control children formed erythrogenic and biologically active, extracellular products. in this study, we demonstrated that erythrogenic culture supernatant concentrates of representative strains (two streptococcus mitis and two streptococcus oralis), when injected intravenously, induced serum tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6 (il-6), and gamma interferon in muramyldipeptide- or propionibacterium acnes-primed c3h/hen mice. the concentrates also induced tumor  necrosis factor alpha, il-6, and thymocyte-activating factor (essentially il-1) in murine peritoneal macrophage, human monocyte, and human whole-blood cultures.  an erythrogenic, heat-labile extracellular protein fraction (f-1) that was concentrated from the culture supernatants of a representative s. mitis strain exhibited the above-mentioned cytokine-inducing activity. this partially purified f-1 fraction also induced thymocyte-activating factor and il-6 in human umbilical vascular endothelial cell and gingival fibroblast cultures.

AB  == between 1987 and 1992, nine patients (three men and six women; mean age, 75 years) presented with chronic postoperative endophthalmitis after cataract extraction and intraocular lens (iol) implantation. eight patients were referred  from another institution. the interval between iol implantation and the beginning of intraocular inflammation averaged 5.6 months (range, 1-19 months). the referral diagnosis was "toxic lens" syndrome in seven patients. the main clinical findings were a hypopyon in the anterior chamber (n = 8) and in the capsule bag (n = 2), and "fibrosis" of the lens capsule (n = 7). in eight patients a vitrectomy was performed, combined with removal of the iol in six cases and with  a total posterior capsulectomy in five cases. pathogenic organisms were identified in vitreous aspirate (6/8), in culture (3/3), and on histopathological examination (4/5) of lens capsule and included coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 3, staphylococcus epidermidis), propionibacterium acnes (n = 1), streptococcus viridans (n = 1), rhodococcus erythropodes and r. luteus (n = 1), and one hyphomycete (alternaria alternata). in chronic recurrent intraocular inflammations following iol implantation, an infectious agent should be excluded  by diagnostic and therapeutic pars plana vitrectomy including removal of the iol  and posterior capsulectomy.

TI  == sterility of refrigerated injectable collagen syringes after injection of patient.
AB  == background: injectable collagen has been used for more than 15 years to correct soft tissue cosmetic defects. after injection, the collagen remaining in the syringe is often refrigerated for later use in the same patient, despite manufacturer and food and drug administration recommendations to discard the unused collagen. objective: this study examined the incidence of bacterial contamination of stored collagen. methods: syringe needle tips and collagen from  50 previously used syringes containing either zyderm i, zyderm ii, or zyplast were cultured separately under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. bacterial isolates were identified. results: propionibacterium acnes was cultured from 7 of 50 needle tips. one positive needle tip culture grew both p. acnes and staphylococcus aureus. bacteria were isolated from only one collagen sample that  grew a nonhemolytic streptococcus that may have represented a laboratory contaminant. conclusion: syringes of collagen stored for repeated use rarely become contaminated with bacteria despite frequent contamination of their needle  tips. skin abscesses after collagen injection should be cultured under anaerobic, as well as aerobic, conditions so that infections caused by p. acnes will not be  missed.

TI  == profiling of propionibacterium acnes recovered from root canal and blood during and after endodontic treatment.
AB  == this report describes the first results of an ongoing study of bacteremia after endodontic treatment of teeth with asymptomatic apical periodontitis. after access cavity preparation, microbiological samples were taken from the root canal under aseptic conditions in 4 single-rooted teeth in 4 patients. in treatment of  2 of the patients, the first 3 reamers (sizes 15-25) were deliberately used to a  level 2 mm beyond the apical foramen. in 2 patients the instrumentation ended inside the root canal 1 mm short of the apical foramen. blood samples were taken  from the patients during the endodontic instrumentation and 10 min after the treatment was completed. using lysis-filtration under anaerobic conditions, the blood was passed through a cellulose membrane filter. the filters as well as the  root canal samples were incubated using an anaerobic technique. anaerobic bacteria were isolated from all root canals. in the 2 patients where overinstrumentation had occurred, propionibacterium acnes was recovered both from the root canals and from the blood samples taken during and after the treatment had been completed. biochemical profiles, antibiotic susceptibility tests and electrophoresis of soluble proteins revealed that propionibacterium acnes isolated from the root canal and blood samples were identical within patients, but varied between patients. facultative anaerobic bacteria including streptococcus sanguis were recovered from only one root canal sample and not from the blood samples.

AB  == antimicrobial activity of six diterpenoids isolated from the bark of podocarpus nagi (podocarpaceae) has been tested against twelve selected microorganisms. totarol [1], the most abundant compound among the six, exhibited potent bactericidal activity only against gram-positive bacteria, among which propionibacterium acnes was the most sensitive bacterium. totarol also showed strong activity against four other gram-positive bacteria tested: streptococcus mutans, bacillus subtilis, brevibacterium ammoniagenes, and staphylococcus aureus (both penicillin-resistant and penicillin-susceptible strains). the bactericidal  activity of totarol was enhanced when it was tested in combination with several other natural products. noticeably, the activity of totarol against sta. aureus was increased eightfold when tested in combination with 1/2mic of anacardic acid  [9]. the synergistic activity of anacardic acid caused the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of totarol to be lowered from 1.56 to 0.2 micrograms/ml.

AB  == we treated five patients for postoperative endophthalmitis who demonstrated an initially good response to intravitreal management of their infection and then suffered a later recurrence. four of the five patients received a single intravitreal injection of antibiotics as the only intravitreal therapy, and the fifth patient received a single antibiotic injection in addition to a partial vitrectomy. all recurrent infections occurred between 10 and 21 days after the original intravitreal injection of antibiotics. at the time of the recurrence, all five patients remained culture positive with the same organism that was initially isolated. the bacterial species isolated were s. epidermidis, group d streptococcus, p. acnes, p. mirabilis, and p. aeruginosa. all patients were ultimately sterilized with repeated intravitreal injections of antibiotics, vitrectomy, and/or intraocular lens removal. factors that were related to recurrent infection were marginal susceptibility of the organism to the originally injected antibiotics, infection with a slowly replicating organism, and infection with a gram-negative bacillus. a single intravitreal injection of antibiotics may only partially treat bacterial endophthalmitis. patients should be observed for at least 3 weeks following treatment of endophthalmitis for recurrence of their infection, and aggressive management, including vitrectomy and repeated intravitreal injections of antibiotics, should be used to treat recurrent infections.

TI  == in-vitro studies with ramoplanin (mdl 62,198): a novel lipoglycopeptide antimicrobial.
AB  == ramoplanin is a novel lipoglycopeptide antimicrobial complex, isolated from the fermentation products of a strain of actinoplanes sp. (atcc 33076), which comprises three closely related polypeptides, each containing chlorinated phenyl  moieties and d-mannose. the in-vitro activity of ramoplanin was compared with those of vancomycin and teicoplanin. ramoplanin was very active against staphylococcus spp., irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, with all isolates inhibited by 1 mg/l or less. concentrations of vancomycin and teicoplanin required to inhibit the same population of bacteria were 4 and 16 mg/l, respectively. ramoplanin was also very active against streptococcus spp. (alpha- and beta-haemolytic species, str. pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis, corynebacterium spp. (including cory. jeikeium), listeria monocytogenes, gardnerella vaginalis, propionibacterium acnes and gram-positive anaerobic bacteria, with all isolates inhibited by 2 mg/l, or less. in general, the activity of ramoplanin against these species was either equal to or only slightly less than teicoplanin and equal to or somewhat greater than vancomycin. with the  exception of bacteroides melaninogenicus and bact. bivius, ramoplanin was not active against gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == contact neodynium-yttrium-aluminum garnet laser acts as a sterilizing scalpel.
AB  == as a cold knife cuts through contaminated or infected wounds, bacteria are dragged along with the blade of the knife through the entire wound. herein, the effect of incisions made with a cold knife is compared with that of incisions made by a contact neodynium-yttrium-aluminum garnet (nd:yag) laser. agar plates were inoculated with multiple strains of exogenous, endogenous, hospital-acquired and multiple antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria. while the cold knife dragged bacteria to sterile areas, incisions made with the contact laser were always sterile. in addition to not dragging bacteria, the tip of the contact laser sterilized itself and provided a bacteria-free zone on either side of the cut, depending on the power density applied. it appears that the contact nd:yag laser acts as a sterilizing wand while providing much needed tactile feedback, precision and hemostasis during surgical treatment with the laser.

AB  == the nasal bacterial flora was studied in 183 healthy men entering military service (entry group), 103 healthy recruits in service (service group), and 185 recruits with acute maxillary sinusitis. the 267 nasal and ipsilateral sinus aspirate findings in the same patients with acute maxillary sinusitis were compared pairwise. in the entry group presumed sinus pathogens were only rarely isolated from the nasal cavities: haemophilus influenzae in 4%, streptococcus pneumoniae in 1%, branhamella catarrhalis in 3%, and streptococcus pyogenes in 0%. the corresponding isolation frequencies in the service group were 19, 13, 3,  and less than 1%, respectively, and those in the group with acute maxillary sinusitis were 61, 25, 7, and 6%, respectively. suppression of the major components of the normal nasal flora, corynebacterium sp., coagulase-negative staphylococci, propionibacterium acnes, and staphylococcus aureus, was seen in the group with acute maxillary sinusitis and also occasionally in the service group. when a sinus aspirate culture yielded a presumed sinus pathogen, the same  pathogen was found in the nasal samples in 91% of the cases. the predictive value of a pathogen-positive nasal finding was highest (93.8%) for s. pyogenes, followed by 77.7% for h. influenzae and 68.7% for s. pneumoniae, and lowest (20%) for b. catarrhalis.

AB  == a comparative study has been made on the cariogenic potentials of propionibacterium acnes atcc 11828, streptococcus intermedius oe-1 and streptococcus mutans oz-1. the strains of p. acnes and s. intermedius have chondroitinase activity. as metabolic end-products, the p. acnes strain produces  mainly a weak acid, propionic acid, whereas strong lactic acid is the main product of the strains of s. intermedius and s. mutans. five germ-free rats were  used for infection with each bacterial strain. the rats were fed with a 25% sucrose diet for 100 days and then sacrificed. the upper and lower molars were used for the determination of the smooth surface caries score. the right upper and lower jaws were used for the preparation of sections which were employed for  the determination of the fissure caries score and microradiography. the left upper and lower jaws were decalcified and used for the preparation of thin sections for staining with gram's, hematoxilin eosin, mallory's, alcian blue-pas, silver and toluidine blue stain. the results obtained were as follows: 1. the recoveries of infected cells in the specimens obtained by swabbing the oral cavities were in the order of 10(4) cfu/mg wet weight regardless of the strains injected. 2. macroscopically, the p. acnes strain decalcified to a lesser extent  some of the enamel surfaces of the lower molars. however, the s. intermedius strain produced mainly the fissure caries of the lower molars. the s. mutans strain destroyed the enamel extensively, resulting in the induction of rampant carious lesions. 3. the caries scores of smooth surface determined by keyes's method were 19.4 +/- 7.8, 46.8 +/- 5.8 and 118.4 +/- 15.4 in the rats infected with the strains of p. acnes, s. intermedius and s. mutans, respectively. the fissure caries score determined by the modified konig's method were 8.5, 22.3 and 36.5 in the sections prepared from the rats infected with the strains of p. acnes, s. intermedius and s. mutans, respectively. 4. microradiography revealed no translucent area in the enamel and dentine of the p. acnes-infected molars, while in the s. intermedius-infected molars translucent areas were found at the dentino-enamel junction neighboring the bottoms of some fissures. the s. mutans-infected molars showed extensive translucent areas over the enamel and dentine of all of the molars. even defects of the enamel and dentinal areas were  observed in some of the molars. 5. the decalcified tooth sections were stained in a similar manner irrespective of the type of organisms used to infect them.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == ischaemic mouse thigh model for evaluation of pathogenicity of non-clostridial anaerobes.
AB  == a mouse thigh model has been devised in which the growing culture of non-clostridial anaerobe in the ischaemic tissue produces inflammatory swelling and death. the swelling of the right thigh served as an index of pathogenicity of the test strain in comparison to the negatively reacting left thigh which received injection of the control strain of bifidobacterium infantis. actinomyces naeslundii exceptionally caused death in all animals within 24 h. mortality and thigh swelling were pronounced (greater than 75%) in case of fusobacterium gonidiaformans and propionibacterium acnes but less (less than 50%) in acidaminococcus fermentans. high (less than 75%) rate of thigh swelling was also  encountered in case of bacteroides oralis, bacteroides corrodens, fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, fusobacterium plauti, peptococcus prevotii, streptococcus intermedius, eubacterium lentum and propionibacterium freudenreichii ss. shermanii.

TI  == bacteriological findings of acute maxillary sinusitis in young adults.
AB  == bacteriological findings in 339 sinus secretions obtained by puncture were investigated in 238 young adult patients with acute maxillary sinusitis. aerobic  and anaerobic cultures were performed immediately. a total of 76% of the secretions were positive. the most common pathogens isolated were haemophilus influenzae (50%), streptococcus pneumoniae (19%), streptococcus pyogenes (5%), and branhamella catarrhalis (2%). coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus were isolated in 8 and 1% of the specimens, respectively. the staphylococci were almost invariably present in low numbers and, therefore, probably represented nasal contamination. other aerobic species were found only occasionally. anaerobes were isolated in 5% of the secretions. in one-half of these, a low concentration of propionibacterium acnes was the sole anaerobe that  was found, and it was usually mixed with a facultative organism (suggestive of contamination with nasal flora). only 2% of the sinuses were considered to have true anaerobic infections (high concentrations of several species typical of anaerobic infection), indicating that anaerobes are not a significant cause of acute maxillary sinusitis in a young adult population. the high recovery of h. influenzae in this study indicates that aminopenicillins may be more appropriate  choice than conventional penicillin in the antimicrobial therapy of acute maxillary sinusitis (only 2 of 168 h. influenzae strains produced beta-lactamase).

TI  == [interferon production and natural killer activity of peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from patients with multiple sclerosis].
AB  == interferon (ifn) -system of patients with multiple sclerosis (ms) during the stable stage of the disease activity was investigated. thirty six patients were divided into 3 groups of mild, moderate and severe patients according to the scores of disability status scale (dss). ifn-alpha producibility and natural killer (nk) activity of peripheral blood lymphocytes (pbl) or large granular lymphocytes (lgl) fractionated from pbl were determined by culturing with hela cells persistently infected with measles virus (hela/mv) and k562 cells. ifn-gamma was induced in pbl obtained from the patients using killed cells of propionibacterium acnes (p. acnes), listeria monocytogenes (lm) and streptococcus salivarius (str. sal.) and a lectin of concanavalin a (con a). both ifn-alpha producibility and nk activity of pbl obtained from the patients were depressed in parallel with the severity of dss of the patients. the depressed nk activity of the patients could be recovered by neither ifn-alpha nor interleukin-2 added exogenously. in addition, the induction of ifn-gamma was also depressed in the patients in response to p. acnes and lm, but not str. sal. or con a. these results suggest that the defect of ifn-system observed in pbl of the patients may result from the depressed function of both lgl and t lymphocyte subpopulations which are responsive to p. acnes and lm. it is postulated that these immunocompetent cells might migrate to subclinical demyelinating lesions of central nervous system where cytokines including ifn-gamma were produced locally, and that their migration might result in the quantitative decrease of lymphocytes participating in ifn-system in pbl of patients with ms.

TI  == contribution of the microflora to proteolysis in the human large intestine.
AB  == protease activities in human ileal effluent were approximately 20-fold greater than in normal faeces. comparative studies with faeces from a person who did not  have a pancreas suggested that a substantial proportion of the proteolytic activity in normal faeces was of bacterial origin. thimerosal, iodoacetate, edta  and cysteine significantly inhibited proteolysis in faeces, but not in small intestinal contents, showing that cysteine and metalloproteases were produced by  bacteria in the large gut. these results, together with results from studies using p-nitroanilide substrates, demonstrated that faecal proteolysis was both qualitatively and quantitatively different from that in the small intestine. studies with pure cultures of proteolytic gut bacteria indicated that the cell-bound proteases of bacteroides fragilis-type organisms were likely to contribute significantly towards proteolytic activity associated with the washed  cell fraction and washed particulate fraction of faeces. extracellular proteases  were formed by streptococcus faecalis st6, propionibacterium acnes p6, clostridium perfringens c16, cl. bifermentans c21 and cl. sporogenes c25. inhibition results suggested that these bacteria, and similar organisms, may be partly responsible for the extracellular proteolytic activity found in the cell-free supernatant fraction of faeces.

TI  == changes in expression of bacterial surface antigens induced by antibiotics and their influence on host defenses.
AB  == concomitant with the discovery that a number of antibiotics were able to induce profound morphological changes (increased septation, thickened walls, filamentation) at low concentrations their ability to inhibit bacterial protein/polysaccharide synthesis was determined. in particular toxin and extracellular enzyme biosynthesis could be repressed by the lincosamines, fusidic acid, erythromycin and streptomycin in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. several of these exoproducts act as antigens associated with microbial virulence  and are therefore of importance in pathogenicity. likewise structural components  such as fimbriae in escherichia coli, m protein in streptococcus pyogenes, protein a in staphylococcus aureus and capsule in bacteroides fragilis and haemophilus influenzae were not synthesised when the producer bacteria were grown in low concentrations of antibiotic. these products, through their importance as  impedins of opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis by white blood cells, are important determinants in the host-parasite relationship. by their loss during drug exposure, potentiation of opsonophagocytosis occurred leading to more rapid  killing of the pathogen. the immunogenicity of the antibiotic-damaged bacteria was also changed under these circumstances.

TI  == distribution of metronidazole susceptibility factors in obligate anaerobes.
AB  == the distribution of metronidazole susceptibility factors in clinically important  bacteria was studied to determine why obligate anaerobes were susceptible to metronidazole and facultative ones were not. with obligate and facultative anaerobes, nitroreductase activity, metronidazole uptake, pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase activity and drug susceptibility were estimated. nitroreductase activity was distributed in the obligate anaerobes and some facultative ones such as streptococcus faecalis. propionibacterium acnes, bifidobacterium adolescentis, actinomyces israelii and most of the facultative anaerobes had no such activity.  bacteria with nitroreductase activity were able to absorb the drug. pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase activity was distributed in all of the obligate anaerobes, whereas prop. acnes, bif. adolescentis, a. israelii and all of the facultative anaerobes had no such activity. distribution of metronidazole  susceptibility was the same as that of pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase activity. therefore metronidazole may selectively inhibit obligate anaerobes with pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase activity. nitroreductase activity may be necessary for drug uptake as well.

AB  == botryomycosis is a chronic infection in which bacterial colonies, or "grains," occur in purulent exudate associated with draining sinus tracts or abscess formation. this condition usually is caused by staphylococcus and streptococcus,  but other organisms occasionally have been implicated. this report describes the  first case of botryomycosis caused by propionibacterium acnes, a diphtheroid that has been rarely associated with opportunistic disease. in this case, plastic embedding allowed the observation of the structural details of the organisms composing the grains and permitted their presumptive identification as diphtheroids. the differential diagnosis of infectious agents that produce grains in tissue sections also will be discussed.

TI  == frequency distributions of periodontal attachment loss. clinical and microbiological features.
AB  == the present investigation attempted to determine if the pattern of past periodontal destruction could be concisely summarized, and related to other clinical and microbiological parameters. 61 subjects between the ages of 12 and 61 years with destructive periodontal disease were evaluated at 6 sites per tooth for redness, plaque, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth, and attachment level. the frequency distribution of baseline attachment level measurements was computed for each individual. a curve fitting algorithm was used to fit the frequency distribution to 1-, 2-, and 3-term normal distributions. the parameters of the fit could be used to summarize concisely all of the frequency distributions. 3 major patterns of attachment loss could be distinguished. pattern i required a two-term distribution with localized destruction at less than 34% of sites and was further divided into 3 groups, depending on average attachment loss at diseased sites. the means of the second peak for the subgroups were 2.7, 5.3, and 8.6 mm, respectively. pattern ii exhibited more widespread disease (greater than 33% of sites affected) with multiple peaks in the frequency distribution requiring a 3-term distribution for satisfactory fit. however, a significant proportion of sites was not affected. pattern iii exhibited a single-peaked normal distribution in which virtually all sites were affected. mean attachment levels of the peaks in this group ranged from 2.7 to 8.4 mm. 23 of the 61 subjects showed significant attachment loss at 1 or more sites during the course of bi-monthly monitoring, as determined by the tolerance method of analysis. subgingival plaque samples were taken from these active sites and matched with control sites prior to therapy. the proportions of fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus intermedius, and eikenella corrodens were significantly  elevated in active and control sites of subjects in groups ii and iii combined (the widespread disease groups), and proportions of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and propionibacterium acnes were elevated in active and control sites of the more localized disease group i subjects. group i subjects showed a 13- to 15-fold decrease in hazard rates of periodontal sites after widman flap surgery and systemic tetracycline, whereas groups ii and iii subjects showed 2-to 6-fold decreases.

TI  == ability of oral bacteria to degrade fibronectin.
AB  == the fibronectin-degrading ability of 116, mainly oral, strains was assayed by using plasma-derived fibronectin adsorbed to a polystyrene surface. ability to degrade fibronectin was revealed in strains of bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides loeschii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, peptococcus prevotii, clostridium sporogenes, and propionibacterium acnes. the fibronectinolytic activity of subgingival bacteriological samples was found to be related to the presence of b. gingivalis  and b. intermedius. in addition, strains of the nonoral bacteroides species b. asaccharolyticus and b. fragilis showed fibronectin-degrading ability. no such ability was detected in the oral strains tested of streptococcus, veillonella, actinomyces, lactobacillus, actinobacillus, capnocytophaga, fusobacterium, or haemophilus species.

TI  == arthropathic properties of cell wall polymers from normal flora bacteria.
AB  == peptidoglycan-polysaccharide (pg-ps) fragments were purified from cell walls of group d streptococci (streptococcus faecium, strains atcc 9790 and f-24) with a protocol which minimizes autolytic activity and tested for ability to induce arthritis in rats. pg-ps fragments from cell walls of other normal flora bacteria (peptostreptococcus productus, and propionibacterium acnes), group a streptococci, and pseudomurein-ps fragments from cell walls of methanobacterium formicicum, were similarly purified and tested. upon intraarticular injection into rat ankles, all pg-ps polymers induced acute inflammation; pseudomurein-ps fragments were approximately five times less active than the pg-ps preparations.  after intraperitoneal injection, p. acnes pg-ps induced a minimal acute arthritis, peptostreptococcus productus pg-ps induced a moderately severe acute joint inflammation followed by a mild chronic arthritis, and both group a and group d streptococcal pg-ps induced severe acute arthritis which evolved into chronic, erosive joint disease; pseudomurein-ps fragments were without effect, consistent with a crucial role for the pg moiety of pg-ps. chronic arthritis induced by group d streptococcal pg-ps subsided after 60 days, whereas that induced by group a streptococcal pg-ps was still active after 128 days. the arthropathic properties of this modest number of common normal flora bacteria suggest that different pg-ps structures derived from the normal flora have the potential to induce a wide range of responses, from transient acute to chronic erosive joint disease.

TI  == the quantity and function of pulmonary alveolar macrophages after splenectomy and corynebacterium parvum.
AB  == we have previously shown that corynebacterium parvum (c. parvum), a nonspecific immunomodulator, partially protects splenectomized and nonsplenectomized mice when challenged with aerosolized pneumococci. we report here the effects of both  splenectomy and c. parvum on the phagocytic function of the lavageable pulmonary  alveolar macrophage (pam). groups of young adult male sprague dawley rats underwent splenectomy or sham operation 3 weeks before injection of c. parvum 1.5 mg ip (or saline) per animal. one week postinjection pam's were harvested. the in vitro phagocytic indices (pi) for pam incubated with tritiated thymidine-labeled  s. aureus or streptococcus pneumoniae, type 14, opsonized with normal rat serum,  were determined. splenectomy had no effect on lung weights, pam yield, or pam phagocytic activity. c. parvum administration significantly increased spleen weight in sham-operated animals, but had no effect on lung weights, pam yield, or phagocytic activity of either control or splenectomized animals. splenectomy in the adult rat did not induce a phagocytic defect in the pam and thus the lavageable pam cannot be considered a significant site of the postsplenectomy defect. since c. parvum protects animals from respiratory challenge with streptococcus pneumoniae but does not alter the number or activity of lavageable  alveolar macrophages, we hypothesize that c. parvum protection is more likely related to our previous finding of an increased clearance of blood-borne bacteria by the expanded and enhanced reticuloendothelial system.

TI  == the effect of the immunomodulator corynebacterium parvum on hemisplenectomized mice.
AB  == the immunomodulator corynebacterium parvum stimulates the reticuloendothelial system and causes splenic hypertrophy. the ability of c parvum to stimulate splenic regeneration in hemisplenectomized mice and decrease susceptibility to intranasal pneumococcal challenge was studied. mice were divided into two groups, control sham-operated (n = 48) and hemisplenectomized (n = 47) animals. ten days  later, each group was divided into two subgroups, those injected with c parvum (700 mcg ivp) and those injected with an equivalent volume of saline. the animals were challenged with streptococcus pneumoniae, which was injected into one nostril three weeks postoperatively, and mortality was assessed. four and one-half weeks postoperatively, splenic tissue was removed, measured, weighed, and submitted for histologic examination. the number of spleen cells per gram of  tissue was assessed. treatment with c parvum resulted in a significant increase in the splenic weight in both hemisplenectomized and control animals compared to  similar saline-injected mice (p less than 0.001). the percentage increase in spleen weight of hemisplenectomized mice (106%) was significantly greater than that for control animals (56%; p less than 0.01). there was no significant difference among experimental groups in the number of spleen cells per gram of splenic tissue or in the histologic characteristics, indicating that c parvum stimulated relatively normal splenic growth. survival following pneumococcal challenge was significantly increased for hemisplenectomized mice by c parvum treatment to a level that did not significantly differ from control mice. this study demonstrates that in mice the deficits related to resistance to infection and spleen size following hemisplenectomy are significantly improved by treatment with c parvum.

TI  == intradermal injection of propionibacterium acnes: a model of inflammation relevant to acne.
AB  == the intradermal injection of 140 micrograms of propionibacterium acnes (cn 6134)  into the ears of female sprague-dawley rats produced a chronic inflammation with  formation of acneiform lesions. inflammation was characterized by more than a doubling of ear thickness at 24 h and a peak of 3-4 times control levels at day 21. at 42 days post injection ears were still 3 times normal thickness. histologically there was early polymorph accumulation giving way to macrophages and lymphocytes by day 7. pilosebaceous follicles overlying the inflamed area lost their sebaceous glands and became hyperplastic cords of cells that grew down and encapsulated inflammatory loci. by day 9 many of these follicles had become secondary comedones. three isolates of p. acnes from inflammatory acne lesions and 4 of 5 isolates from non-acne patients produced results similar to that of the strain cn 6134. in these cases the number of histologically evident secondary comedones was correlated with ear thickness. in contrast, samples of streptococcus lactis, escherichia coli b, and staphylococcus epidermidis failed to produce this combination of chronic inflammation and high lesion count. benzoyl peroxide, tetracycline, erythromycin, phenidone, naproxen, and cis and trans retinoic acid were inactive as inhibitors of p. acnes cn 6134-induced ear thickening. the corticosteroid fluocinolone acetonide produced dramatic suppression of inflammation, but upon cessation of treatment the ears returned to inflamed levels. the specificity for p. acnes, the formation of acneiform lesions, and the recalcitrance of the inflammation suggest our model is indeed relevant to acne.

TI  == acetic, propionic, and oleic acid as the possible factors influencing the predominant residence of some species of propionibacterium and coagulase-negative staphylococcus on normal human skin.
AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of acetic and propionic acid for resident bacteria on normal human skin, such as propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus epidermidis, was 25 mg/ml or more at any ph tested (ph 5.5-6.8). while the mic of these acids for most of the transient bacteria was markedly decreased by lowering the ph of the media and at ph 5.5, the mean ph value of the normal human skin, the mic was 6.25 mg/ml or less. the mic of oleic acid for some strains of gram-positive transient bacteria of streptococcus, micrococcus, or bacillus was 100 micrograms/ml or less at all ph's tested. staphylococcus aureus  was resistant to this acid at ph 6.8, but became as sensitive as streptococcus when the ph was lowered. the growth of p. acnes, the most predominant resident bacterium, was enhanced markedly and reached a maximum level at 6.25 mg/ml of propionic acid, 12.5 mg/ml of acetic acid, and 50-100 micrograms/ml of oleic acid. on the basis of these results, we presumed that acetic, propionic, and oleic acids are factors influencing the predominant residence of some species of  propionibacterium and coagulase-negative staphylococcus on normal human skin.

AB  == the bacterial findings of 73 maxillary sinuses in 48 patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis, together with 7 non-inflamed sinuses, are reported. employing an intraoperative technique and simultaneous collection of 3 different  types of specimens in the present investigation made possible comparison of their bacterial characteristics. the results indicated that intraoperative culture of antral mucosa seems to provide the most reliable finding of bacterial flora in chronic maxillary sinusitis. the anaerobic bacteria were never found in the mucosal culture of non-inflamed sinus. the anaerobes appeared to invade the sinus cavity following the sealing of the ostium through the lymphatic or venous system and maintain the inflammatory process. microbiological analysis of the results between the infected and non-inflamed sinuses established anaerobic bacteria as the most important pathogen in chronic maxillary sinusitis. the predominant anaerobes recovered in descending order of frequency were veillonella sp., peptococcus sp., propionibacterium acne and anaerobic nonspore-forming gpb. statistical analysis of the results of mucosal culture of inflamed and control materials demonstrated that those aerobic and faculatative bacteria recovered in  the inflamed sinus appeared to be the normal inhabitants of non-inflamed sinus mucosa. the presence of normal flora in the normal healthy sinus mucosa may explain the chain of events that follows the occlusion of the ostium. these aerobic bacteria may become pathogenic and play a role in the pathogenesis of sinusitis.

TI  == adherence of streptococci to cells infected with herpesvirus.
AB  == the attachment of streptococci and staphylococci to cells infected with influenza virus has been previously reported and has been correlated with the increased incidence of these bacterial infections during flu epidemics. the present work was initiated to determine whether infection with herpes simplex virus (hsv) might lead to preferential bacterial attachment. hep-2 cells were grown in monolayer and infected with hsv, type i or type ii. twenty-four hours later the cells were incubated with suspensions of various organisms, including group a and b streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, propionibacterium acnes, and candida albicans. after incubation for one hour, the cells were washed and fixed. bacterial adherence and virus infection were assessed by scanning electron microscopy (sem) as well as conventional light and transmission electron microscopy (tem). only group a streptococci adhered to virus-infected cells, both to cells infected with hsv, type i and those infected with hsv, type ii. sem and  tem revealed bacteria attaching to cells with budding virus particles. preincubation of infected cells with anti-hsv serum prevented bacterial adherence. these findings suggest that infection of oral epithelium with hsv might lead to superinfection with group a streptococci.

TI  == improved survival after pneumococcus in splenectomized and nonsplenectomized mice with corynebacterium parvum.
AB  == splenectomy increases the susceptibility to infections with certain bacteria, particularly streptococcus pneumoniae. because the immunomodulator corynebacterium parvum expands the phagocytic cell compartment and enhances reticuloendothelial function, we tested the effect of c parvum in mice challenged with aerosolized pneumococci. mice splenectomized seven days before pneumococcal  challenge and treated intraperitoneally with 700 micrograms of c parvum immediately after exposure were protected when compared with splenectomized or sham-operated saline-injected controls. analysis of proportional hazards showed the risk of dying in order of greatest to least as follows: splenectomy/saline, sham/saline, splenectomy/c parvum and sham/c parvum. the benefits of an intact spleen and c parvum seemed to be additive in their protective effects after aerosol pneumococcal challenge. after intravenous challenge, bloodstream clearance was improved in sham-operated mice at three days after c parvum injection compared with saline-injected sham-operated controls and c parvum-injected splenectomized mice. a significant improvement in bacterial clearance did not occur until seven days after c parvum treatment in splenectomized mice. the results demonstrate the value of a nonspecific immunomodulator for enhancing the defense mechanisms of both normal and splenectomized animals.

AB  == the microbiology of otitis media (om) has been documented by cultures of middle ear fluid (mef) obtained by needle aspiration. the results of studies of bacteriology of om from sweden, finland and the united states are very similar: streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae are the most important pathogens: gram-negative enteric bacilli are isolated from mef of approximately equal to 20% of infants to six weeks of age but are rarely present in mef of older children; group a beta hemolytic streptococcus and staphylococcus aureus are infrequent causes of otitis. preliminary results suggest that anaerobic bacteria are responsible for some episodes of om. although epidemiologic data suggest that virus infection is associated with om, the results of ten studies indicate that these agents are infrequently isolated from mef of children with om. viruses were isolated from 29 to 663 patients (4.4%). respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus were isolated most frequently. the results of seven studies of mycoplasma infection in 771 patients with om included only one isolation of mycoplasma pneumoniae from mef. these results indicate that viruses  and mycoplasmas are uncommonly found in mef of patients with om, but few studies  have been attempted in recent years. chlamydia trachomatosis is the etiologic agent of a mild but prolonged pneumonia in infants. om may accompany the respiratory infection, and c. trachomatis has been isolated from mef of some of these infants. recent studies of asymptomatic children with persistent mef indicate that bacterial pathogens are present in some of these fluids. investigators in columbus, boston, and pittsburgh obtained mef for culture at the time of myringotomy or placement of tympanostomy tubes. bacteria were isolated from mef of 50% of these children; s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, or group a streptococcus were isolated from 10% to 20% of cases. there were only minimal differences in the rates of isolation of bacteria from serous, mucoid, or purulent fluids. the significance of these results is uncertain, but they suggest that the persistent effusion may be a result of asymptomatic but prolonged infection or may be an immune response to a persisting antigen.

TI  == antibody coated bacteria in otitis media with effusions.
AB  == the significance of bacterial isolates of coagulase negative staphylococcus epidermidis and corynebacterium species in middle ear fluids remains controversial. this study was undertaken to evaluate the possible role of these organisms in different effusions. cultures were obtained from the external cartilaginous ear, bony canal, tympanic membrane, middle ear fluids, tonsils and  nasopharynx of 93 patients at the time of myringotomy for otitis media with effusion. isolates of coagulase negative staphylococci from the middle ear, external ear and posterior aural skin were evaluated in regard to antibiotic sensitivity, biochemical tests and phage typing. furthermore, in another series of patients in whom these organisms were isolated, specific antibody activity in  both middle ear washings and corresponding sera were measured, using the technique of indirect immunofluorescence. the results suggest that the isolates from the middle ear and ear canal are not always identical. there is some evidence that specific igm and igg as well as iga responses to these organisms are present in middle ear washings and not in corresponding serum. these results  suggest that coagulase negative staphylococcus and corynebacterium species in middle ear effusions may not be contaminants from the external canal and that a local immune response may be produced by these organisms. whether or not these organisms represent etiologic agents responsible for otitis media with effusion cannot be ascertained from this data. one very interesting point is the presence  of igf coating of organisms in some effusions.

TI  == tumor-immunotherapeutic efficacy of serratia marcescens polyribosomes.
AB  == the ability of polyribosomes, obtained from several bacterial species, to suppress the development of cutaneous sad2 fibrosarcomas in dba/2 mice were evaluated. suppression of tumor appearance depended upon the tumor load at the time of treatment, dose of polyribosomes, and species source of polyribosomes, with serratia marcescens being superior to escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumoniae, mycobacterium bovis (pasteur), mycobacterium smegmatis, and propionibacterium acnes (formerly corynebacterium parvum). a single injection of  5 or 50 microgram of serratia polyribosomes at the tumor site 72 hr after the intradermal administration of 1.5 x 10(3) sad2 cells resulted in 66 to 95% survival. all untreated animals expired within 50 days. tumor suppression occurred at both flank and footpad sites. presensitization with polyribosomes and incorporation of polyribosomes into adjuvant were not required for the tumor-suppressive effect. treatment of serratia polyribosomes with rnase or pronase reduced the number of survivors. endotoxin was not detectable with the limulus amebocyte lysate assay.

TI  == biphasic protection against bacterial infection in mice induced by vaccination of propionibacterium acnes.
AB  == a single intraperitoneal injection of the phenol-treated cells of propionibacterium acnes into mice showed nonspecific resistance against subsequent lethal doses of an intraperitoneal challenge of klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes. the protection showed a biphasic pattern. the maximum protection, designated as the early phase protection, was seen in mice injected with p. acnes vaccine 1 to 2 days before the challenge, whereas the late phase protection was seen in mice vaccinated 16 to 22 days before the challenge. the activity of the reticuloendothelial system in mice after vaccination also showed a biphasic pattern with the peak on days 4  and 12. the delayed activation of the reticuloendothelial system lasted up to 3 weeks and coincided with the period of the late phase protection. the early phase resistance was markedly impaired by the treatment with hydrocortisone and carrageenan, but not by the treatment with anti-thymocyte serum, actinomycin d, or cyclophosphamide. the number of peritoneal polymorphonuclear leukocytes in vaccinated mice increased on days 1 to 2. the number of macrophages also increased at 2 to 21 days after vaccination and reached its maximum on day 14. total activities of acid phosphatase, nitro blue tetrazolium reduction, and the phagocytic activities of peritoneal exudate cells were also enhanced on and after day 1 after the injection of p. acnes vaccine.

TI  == immunotherapeutic response of concanavalin a-bound l1210 vaccine enhanced by a streptococcal immunopotentiator, ok-432.
AB  == immunotherapeutic response to concanavalin a (con a)-bound l1210 murine leukemic  vaccine and immunopotentiators was examined in histocompatible animals bearing a  small burden l1210 leukemic cells. when combined with con a-bound vaccine, a streptococcal immunopotentiator, ok-432 (nsc b116209), prepared from streptococcus pyogenes, was potent in antitumor therapy and resulted in a number  of cured animals. administration of either con-a-bound vaccine or ok-432 alone did not produce any beneficial effect on leukemic animals. the enhanced therapeutic response was dependent on the effectiveness of the dose and timing of the administration of ok-432 when given after vaccination. combined modality of con a-bound l1210 vaccine and ok-432 was not effective in animals bearing p388 murine leukemic cells, which indicates specificity of therapeutic response. in enhancing the therapeutic potency of con a-bound leukemia vaccine, pyran copolymer (nsc 46015) was as effective as ok-432, whereas bacillus calmette-guerin and corynebacterium parvum were far less effective. when combined with ok-432, therapeutic response to con a-bound l1210 vaccine was much greater than response to glutaraldehyde-, mitomycin c-, or vibrio cholerae neuraminidase-treated l1210 vaccine.

TI  == [the bacterial flora of preputial space].
AB  == the bacterial flora of the preputial space of 210 healthy males (43 children aged between 2 and 11 years, 137 males between 12 and 60 years and 30 men over 60 years) was determined by smears and cultueres from glans penis, sulcus coronarius and the adjacent prepuce. the results were grouped according to various criteria, e.g. glans covered or uncovered and age of males. differences in the distribution of germs could be found in relationship to age. in the case of an uncovered glans penis the presence of microbial flora corresponds to the grampositive saprophytic bacteria in areas rich in sebaceous glands. in the case of a covered glans the density of microorganisms increases. prevalent are gramnegative anaerobes, especially bacterioides melaninogenicus, also enterococci, enterobacteria and coagulase-positive staphylococci.

TI  == quantitation of skin bacteria: lethality of the wash solution used to remove bacteria.
AB  == a widely used technique for the quantitative removal of bacteria from the skin uses a detergent, triton x-100 (p, t-octylphenoxynonaethoxyethanol), to remove and suspend the bacteria. we determined the half-life for the survival of five common skin bacteria suspended in the solution. the shortest-lived was streptococcus pyogenes with a half-life of 0.9 hours. all of the others (propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, and  klebsiella pneumoniae) had half-lives of 1.5 hours or longer. k. pneumoniae, the  only gram-negative species tested, had a half-life of more than 30 hours. thus, a one hour delay in plating and incubation of samples suspended in this detergent solution inhibits quantitation of most species tested.

TI  == electron capture gas-liquid chromatographic study of metabolites produced by some arthritic transudate-associated organisms in vitro and in vivo in rabbit models.
AB  == computerized, frequency-pulsed, modulated electron capture gas-liquid chromatography was used to study the acid metabolites produced in vitro in fetal  calf serum and in vivo in an animal chamber model. several strains of diplostreptococcus agalactiae, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus serogroups a, b, and g were studied. all of these organisms have been reported to be associated with arthritic transudates in humans. metabolites were detected by this method from derivatized extracts of both spent  fetal calf serum and chamber fluids. since there was little host response to the  organisms cultured in the chambers, it is highly probable that the products detected represent metabolites produced in an in vivo type of environment. the metabolic patterns were reproducible and exhibited many similarities in vitro and in vivo. production of the acids detected was reproducible, and these acids were  useful identification markers. the data support published reports (j. b. brooks,  c. c. alley, and j. a. liddle, anal. chem. 46: 1930-1934, 1974; j. b. brooks, g.  choudhary, r. b. craven, d. edman, c. c. alley, and j. a. liddle, j. clin. microbiol. 5:625-628, 1977; j. b. brooks, r. b. craven, a. r. melton, and c. c. alley, in h. h. johnson and w. b. newson, ed., second international symposium on  rapid methods and automation on microbiology, 1976; j. b. brooks, r. b. craven, d. schlossberg, c. c. alley, and f. m. pitts, j. clin. microbiol. 8:203-208, 1978; j. b. brooks, d. s. kellogg, c. c. alley, h. b. short, and h. h. handsfield, j. infect. dis. 129:660-668, 1974) that bacterial metabolites might be detectable in diseased body fluids. the growth characteristics of the organisms in the animal model and fetal calf serum are discussed, and a moderately priced computer for performing data manipulations is evaluated.

TI  == synergistic lysis of erythrocytes by propionibacterium acnes.
AB  == sheep and human erythrocytes, partially processed by staphylococcus aureus or clostridium perfringens, were susceptible to lysis in the presence of propionibacterium acnes. p. acnes liberated a lipase that was detected on tween 80 agar and also on phospholipase c-precipitated egg yolk agar. such a lipase might have contributed in the process of an intensified cellular lysis. similar reactions were attempted with lactobacillus acidophilus, known to possess a nondiffusible lipase, and failed to produce any such reactions. the synergistic reactions, between p. acnes and c. perfringens, were compared with the classical  camp reaction in an attempt to find a correlation with the established membrane composition of the erythrocytes involved. synergistic reactions observed do seem  to reflect the membrane composition. such findings, besides being contributory to an understanding of the role of these organisms in the process of pathogenesis, are of importance in the elucidation of molecular organization of biomembranes. detailed studies, involving a large number of representative anaerobic bacteria,  may also help provide an avenue in anaerobic species identification.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of acute otitis media in children.
AB  == tympanocentesis and aerobic and anaerobic cultivation of the middle-ear fluid obtained was performed through one or both tympanic membranes of 62 children with acute otitis media. aerobic bacteria alone, predominantely pneumococcus and hemophilus influenzae, were isolated from 57% of patients; anaerobic organisms alone, most commonly propionibacterium acnes and peptococcus, from 15%. thirteen  percent yielded mixtures of aerobes and anaerobes, and several had multiple aerobic or anaerobic agents. the isolation of only anaerobic bacteria, supported  in some patients by gram-stain observations of middle-ear fluid, suggest that these bacteria, especially petococcus, may occasionally play a direct role in acute otitis media.

AB  == during 24 months, 200 upper gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed on 193 patients. blood cultures were obtained before and five and 30 minutes after the procedure using thiol (50 ml) and trypticase soy broth (100 ml) media. the mean endoscopic time was 34 minutes. sixteen patients developed bacteremia (8%). twelve groups of microorganisms were detected in positive blood cultures: streptococcus (5 species), lactobacillus sp, veillonella alcalescens, staphylococcus aureus, staph epidermidis, propioni-bacterium acnes, corynebacterium acnes, and bacillus subtilis. seven patients had positive blood cultures at five and 30 minutes, eight at five minutes, and one at 30 minutes only. there was no clear correlation of bacteremia with the age or previous history of the patient, biopsy, active bleeding, endoscopic time, or findings. a  follow-up study of all patients for six months to two years indicated no complications related to endoscopy and/or bacteremia.

TI  == [growth of non-sporing anaerobes in an oxygen-free blood culture system (author's transl)].
AB  == the efficacy of the commercially available vacutainer blood culture system to support the growth of non-sporing anaerobes was compared with two laboratory-prepared blood culture media (supplemented thioglycollate medium and brain heart infusion). the media were inoculated with 10, 100 and 1000 organisms  of the species tested, and the number of colony-forming units was determined at intervals of 8-10 hrs. analogous experiments were performed with batches of the media to which 10% vol/vol of human blood had been added. from the results obtained with strains of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides splanchnicus, sphaerophorus necrophorus, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and propionibacterium acnes it became obvious that growth of non-sporing anaerobes was significantly enhanced in the vacutainer culture tubes, whereas enterobacteriaceae and streptococcus spp. grew equally well in all the media tested.

TI  == isolation and identification of fecal bacteria from adult swine.
AB  == an examination of the fecal microflora of adult swine was made with regard to the efficiency of several roll tube media in enumeration and recovery of anaerobes, the effects of medium constituents on recovery, and the isolation and identification of the predominant kinds of bacteria. total number of organisms by microscopic bacterial counts varied among fecal samples from 4.48 x 10(10) to 7.40 x 10(10) bacteria/g (wet weight). comparison of different nonselective roll  tube media indicated that about 30% of the fecal bacteria could be recovered with a rumen fluid (40%, vol/vol) medium (m98-5). recoveries of 21 and 15%, respectively, were obtained with m10 and rumen fluid-glucose-cellobiose agar (rgca) media. rumen fluid, trypticase, sugars, and co2 gas phase were important components required for maximum recovery with this medium. similar high recoveries of anaerobes were also obtained with m98-5 containing swine cecal extract of place in rumen fluid or m10 plus swine cecal extract. significantly lower recoveries were observed with rcga, media supplemented with swine fecal extracts, reinforced clostridial medium, brain heart infusion agar, and prereduced blood agar. ninety percent of the bacteria isolated from roll tube media were gram positive and consisted of facultatively anaerobic streptococci, eubacterium sp., clostridium sp., and propionibacterium acnes. the remainder of the flora (8%) included several other species of anaerobes and escherichia coli.  rumen fluid (or volatile fatty acids), trypticase, and yeast extract additions to basal media stimulated the growth of anaerobic strains. variation in the relative proportions of the predominant fecal microflora was observed. this work indicates that satisfactory enumeration, isolation and cultivation of the predominant microflora in swine feces can be obtained when strict anaerobic culture methods and a rumen fluid medium are used.

TI  == effect of bacterial products on inflammatory reactions in the dental pulp.
AB  == culture filtrates (extracellular components) and material obtained from disintegrated cells (intracellular components) of cultured plaque bacteria were studied for their capacity to induce inflammatory reactions in the dental pulp. class v cavities were prepared on the buccal surface of 94 teeth: 42 test and 52  control teeth in six adult monkeys. lyophilized bacterial components were sealed  into the test cavities either alone or following an 8-h topical application of a  solution of the same components in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs). culture medium and pbs were applied in two sets of control cavities. a third set was restored with zinc oxide-eugenol cement. the animals were killed 32 h after the initiation of the experiment and the pulps were examined histologically. teeth treated trophil leukocytes in the area of the pulp subjacent to the cut dentin tubules. abscess formation was frequently found. the severe reactions which developed were independent of differences between individual animals and differences in thickness of the remaining dentin. the controls showed damage to the odontoblasts but little or no neutrophil infiltration. the findings confirm that products of bacteria applied to exposed dentin initiate inflammatory reactions in the dental pulp.

TI  == characteristics of bacteria isolated by the anaerobic roll-tube method from cheeses and ground beef.
AB  == in this study the methods of hungate were used to quantitate the anaerobic bacteria present in commercially available ground beef, cheddar cheese, and german hand cheese. of 235 anaerobic roll-tube isolates from ground beef and german hand cheese, all were facultative anaerobes. of 213 anaerobic roll-tube isolates from cheddar cheese, 91% were facultative anaerobes and 9% were obligate anaerobes. using results of biochemical tests, 14 or the 17 obligately anaerobic  isolates from cheddar cheese were propionibacterium acnes, two were strains of propionibacterium that could not be speciated, and one was tentatively identified as a strain of streptococcus evolutus. obligate anaerobes were estimated to be present in the cheddar cheese at a level of about 10(6)/g. the possible significance of these levels of p. acnes in nonsterile foods is discussed.
