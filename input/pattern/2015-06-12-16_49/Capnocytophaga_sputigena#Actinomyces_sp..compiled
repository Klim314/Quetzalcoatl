TI  - The cultivable human oral gluten-degrading microbiome and its potential implications in coeliac disease and gluten sensitivity.
AB  - Coeliac disease is characterized by intestinal inflammation caused by gluten, proteins which are widely contained in the Western diet. Mammalian digestive enzymes are only partly capable of cleaving gluten, and fragments remain that induce toxic responses in patients with coeliac disease. We found that the oral microbiome is a novel and rich source of gluten-degrading organisms. Here we report on the isolation and characterization of the cultivable resident oral microbes that are capable of cleaving gluten, with special emphasis on the immunogenic domains. Bacteria were obtained by a selective culturing approach and enzyme activities were characterized by: (i) hydrolysis of paranitroanilide-derivatized gliadin-derived tripeptide substrates; (ii) gliadin degradation in-gel (gliadin zymography); (iii) gliadin degradation in solution; (iv) proteolysis of the highly immunogenic alpha-gliadin-derived 33-mer peptide. For selected strains pH activity profiles were determined. The culturing strategy yielded 87 aerobic and 63 anaerobic strains. Species with activity in at least two of the four assays were typed as: Rothia mucilaginosa HOT-681, Rothia aeria HOT-188, Actinomyces odontolyticus HOT-701, Streptococcus mitis HOT-677, Streptococcus sp. HOT-071, Neisseria mucosa HOT-682 and Capnocytophaga sputigena HOT-775, with Rothia species being active in all four assays. Cleavage specificities and substrate preferences differed among the strains identified. The approximate molecular weights of the enzymes were ~75 kD (Rothia spp.), ~60 kD (A. odontolyticus) and ~150 kD (Streptococcus spp.). In conclusion, this study identified new gluten-degrading microorganisms in the upper gastrointestinal tract. A cocktail of the most active oral bacteria, or their isolated enzymes, may offer promising new treatment modalities for coeliac disease.
TI  - Comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (RP) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (GRs = good responders) or periodontal health (PH) using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). METHODS: At baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with PH and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM. The subjects with periodontitis were classified as having RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or more than three sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GRs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after treatment. Significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis and chi(2) tests. RESULTS: More species were detected in patients with disease (GR or RP) than in those without disease (PH). Subjects with RP were distinguished from GRs or those with PH by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Campylobacter gracilis, Eubacterium nodatum, Selenomonas noxia, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Treponema spp., and Eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, TM7 spp. oral taxon [OT] 346/356, Bacteroidetes sp. OT 272/274, Solobacterium moorei, Desulfobulbus sp. OT 041, Brevundimonas diminuta, Sphaerocytophaga sp. OT 337, Shuttleworthia satelles, Filifactor alocis, Dialister invisus/pneumosintes, Granulicatella adiacens, Mogibacterium timidum, Veillonella atypica, Mycoplasma salivarium, Synergistes sp. cluster II, and Acidaminococcaceae [G-1] sp. OT 132/150/155/148/135) (P <0.05). Species that were more prevalent in subjects with PH than in patients with periodontitis included Actinomyces sp. OT 170, Actinomyces spp. cluster I, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Lautropia mirabilis, Propionibacterium propionicum, Rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and Streptococcus sanguinis (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: As determined by HOMIM, patients with RP presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the GR and PH groups.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological analysis of subjects treated with Branemark or AstraTech implants: a 7-year follow-up study.
AB  - AIMS: To assess the impact of different implant systems on the clinical conditions and the microbiota at implants, and whether the presence of bacteria at tooth sites was predictive of the presence at implant sites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects with either AstraTech or Branemark in function for 7 years were enrolled. Sub-gingival bacterial samples at tooth and implant sites were collected with sterile endodontic paper points, and analyzed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method (40 species). RESULTS: Fifty-four subjects, 27 supplied with AstraTech (n=132 implants) and 27 with Branemark (n=102) implants, were studied. Test tooth sites had significantly less evidence of bleeding on probing (P<0.001) and presence of plaque (P<0.001) than implant test sites. Implant sites presented with deeper probing pocket depth than tooth sites (mean difference: 1.1 mm, standard error of differences: 0.08, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.9-1.3, P<0.001). Tannerella forsythia (P<0.05), Capnocytophaga sputigena (P<0.05), Actinomyces israelii (P<0.05) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (P<0.05) were found at higher levels at tooth surfaces. No differences in bacterial load for any species were found between the two implant systems. The odds of being present/absent at tooth and implants sites were only significant for Staphylococcus aureus [odds ratio (OR): 5.2 : 1, 95% CI: 1.4-18.9, P<0.01]. CONCLUSIONS: After 7 years in function, implants presented with deeper probing depths than teeth. S. aureus was commonly present at both teeth and implants sites. S. aureus at tooth sites was predictive of also being present at implant sites.
TI  - Gingival crevice microbiota from Chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing  ulcerative gingivitis.
AB  - The objective of this study was to quantitatively compare the bacterial population structure in plaque from the gingival margin of two groups of 21 Chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (NUG). Subjects were recruited in four dental clinics in Eastern China. Samples were quantitatively assessed by immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization for taxa known to be associated with periodontal diseases. The analyses showed that the fusiform taxa (Fusobacterium nucleatum/Fusobacterium periodonticum, Leptotrichia buccalis, Tannerella forsythensis, and Capnocytophaga sp.), Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Selenomonas sputigena, and treponemes were present in both groups with high prevalence. Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinomyces gerencseriae were much more prevalent in the NUG group. Quantitatively, most taxa, including P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum and the treponemes, accounted, on average, for < 3% of the total bacterial cell number. Only P. intermedia/P. nigrescens, P. gingivalis, S. sputigena, A. gerencseriae, and the sum of all monitored suspected periodontal pathogens were significantly increased in the NUG group. The present study demonstrates for both groups a highly diverse plaque composition and suggests that, etiologically, the overall concentration and the concerted effects of the entire group of opportunistic pathogens thriving in NUG-associated plaque are of prime importance.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult Sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.
AB  - Little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. We assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult Sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. A pooled subgingival plaque sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. Whole genomic DNA probes and the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. Using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold, between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. The percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. Miswak users harbored significantly higher Streptococcus intermedius, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Veillonella parvula, Actinomyces israelii, and Capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower Selenomonas sputigena, Streptococcus salivarius, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. Probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and V. parvula than those 4-5 mm. Our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.
TI  - Association of early onset periodontitis microbiota with aspartate aminotransferase activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the activity of the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) using the colorimetric PerioGard (PTM) test and the subgingival microflora in early onset periodontitis lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 25 otherwise healthy individuals exhibiting early onset periodontitis (EOP). In each patient four experimental sites were identified comprising one deep periodontal pocket (PD >5 mm) randomly chosen in each quadrant. Bacterial samples were obtained from the experimental sites, consecutively cultured anaerobically and in 10% CO(2) using selective and nonselective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. Clinical measurements as well as AST activity, assessed either as positive or negative using the PTM, were recorded at the same sites. RESULTS: Sixty-two sites exhibited AST positive and 38 AST negative activity. Analysis of bacterial counts using the ANOVA (Mann Whitney U-test) showed that Streptococcus intermedius, Peptostreptococcus micros, Campylobacter concisus, Bacteroides forsythus, Camplobacter gracilis, Campylobacter rectus and Selenomonas sputigena were significantly higher in sites with AST-positive activity. The odds ratio of having high prevalence of S. intermedius, P. micros, C. concisus, B. forsythus, C. gracilis, C. rectus and S. sputigena in the presence of a positive AST site was very high (range: 3.5-17.0). Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Gemella morbillorum, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Fusobacterium varium, Eubacterium lentum and Prevotella oralis were detected in significantly higher proportions in sites with AST negative activity and manifested a negative odds ratio in the presence of AST positive sites. The logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking and bleeding upon probing showed a significant association with AST activity, while plaque and suppuration were not found to be significant predictors of AST activity. The co-infection of Porphyromonas gingivalis, B. forsythus and P. micros, or P. gingivalis, B. forsythus and C. rectus were found to be significantly associated with the AST activity (p<0.001). AST positive sites revealed significantly higher occurrence of co-infections by P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, S. sputigena or by P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, S. intermedius than AST negative sites (p<0.001). P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, A. naeslundii co-infection was found significantly higher in the AST negative sites (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The present study found a high level of agreement between the presence of putative periodontal pathogens and positive AST scores at periodontal sites that clinically were considered to be potentially disease active. Prospective studies should be performed to confirm the findings.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  - A diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. To investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. Forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. Streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), Streptococcus mitis (66-65%), Prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), Eikenella corrodens (51-52%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), Capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), Actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and Prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. Several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella loescheii, Campylobacter gracilis, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter concisus, Peptostreptococcus micros and Selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. The bacterial species Streptococcus constellatus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, E. corrodens and Fusobacterium nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas Streptococcus intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were associated with bleeding.
TI  - Effect of three mouthrinses, containing amine/stannous fluoride, herbal extracts  or Emser salt on the growth of oral bacteria--an in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Clinical studies have shown the efficacy of mouthrinses in reducing plaque accumulation and inflammation of oral tissues. The aim of this in vitro study was to compare the effect of three mouthrinses: Meridol, an organic amine/ stannous fluoride solution; Parodontax, containing herbal ingredients; and an 0.8 % Emser salt solution, on the growth of oral bacteria and dental plaque. METHODS: Growth of Actinomyces viscosus T14V, Capnocytophaga ochracea 25, C. sputigena 4, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.) Y4, and pooled supragingival plaque in the presence of the various mouthrinses, applied to paper discs, was tested in an agar diffusion test. In a second series of tests, the 4 bacterial strains were exposed to the agents for about 3 min to simulate rinsing, then the agent was removed, and the bacteria were inoculated into fresh nutrient broth. After 48 h bacterial growth was measured in a spectrophotometer and compared with the controls. RESULTS: In the agar diffusion test only Meridol, the organic amine/stannous fluoride-containing solution, could inhibit bacterial growth, except for A. a. Y4. When the bacteria where in contact with the agents for only a few minutes these results were confirmed. Neither Paradontax nor Emser salt inhibited the growth of the bacteria, and A. a. Y4 proved to be resistant to all three agents. Growth of the other three strains was inhibited by Meridol 92-99% (undiluted), 85-96% (1:5) and 83-98% (1:10). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that only Meridol contains ingredients capable of inhibiting the growth of oral bacteria in vitro. The efficacy of the other two mouthrinses in reducing plaque accumulation in vivo has to be explained by other mechanisms.
TI  - Microbial composition of supra- and subgingival plaque in subjects with adult periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND, AIMS: The purpose of the present study was to compare and relate the  microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51 +/- 14 years). METHODS: A total of 1,170 samples of supra and subgingival plaque were collected from the mesial aspect of every tooth (up to 28 supra and 28 subgingival samples) from each subject and evaluated for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level, were made at 6 sites per tooth. The counts (levels), % DNA probe count (proportion) and % of sites colonized (prevalence) of each species in supra and separately in subgingival plaque were computed for each subject. Significance of differences between supra and subgingival plaque for each species was sought using the Wilcoxon signed ranks test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: All 40 taxa were detected in both supra and subgingival plaque. Actinomyces species were the most prevalent taxa in both habitats. 75 to 100% of supra and 62 to 100% of subgingival sites were colonized by at least one of the 5 Actinomyces species. Supragingival samples exhibited significantly higher counts of Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Neisseria mucosa, Streptococcus gordonii, Capnocytophaga ochracea and Capnocytophaga sputigena when compared with mean counts in subgingival samples taken from the same tooth surfaces. Subgingival plaque samples presented significantly higher counts of Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Bacteroides forsythus and Porphykromonas gingivalis. Subgingival samples exhibited a significantly higher proportion of "red" and "orange complex" species, while supragingival plaque exhibited higher proportions of "green" and "purple" complex species as well as Actinomyces species. Suspected periodontal pathogens could be detected in supragingival plaque from sites where subgingival samples were negative for the same species. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that supragingival plaque can harbor putative periodontal pathogens, suggesting a possible role of this environment as a reservoir of such species for the spread or reinfection of subgingival sites.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  - Eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. The aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. Forty-one different microbial species were isolated. Gemella morbillorum and Peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while P. micros, Streptococcus intermedius, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella loeschei, P. melaninogenica and Selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. The bacterial species S. constellatus, G. morbillorum and P. magnus were isolated in greater numbers in incisors and P. micros, S. intermedius, Campylobacter concisus, Bacteroides egertheii, B. forsythus, P. oralis and S. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. Cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. Cluster I was predominated by S. constellatus, S. mitis, S. sanguis, G. morbillorum, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; cluster II was predominated by S. sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, C. ochracea and P. intermedia; cluster III was predominated by S. mitis, C. ochracea, F. nucleatum, P. loeschei, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; and finally cluster IV was predominated by S. sanguis, C. gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Campylobacter gracilis, F. nucleatum and P. intermedia. The bacterial species S. constellatus, P. micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Eikenella corrodens and F. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while S. intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.
TI  - Subgingival microflora in smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  - Cigarette smoking is a potent risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. The objective of this study was to detect the microbial profile of early onset periodontitis in smokers and compare it to that of non-smokers. The study population consisted of 50 systemically healthy individuals aged 25 to 38 years, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. 25 patients were smokers (> 20 cigarettes/day) and 25 non-smokers. Two pooled bacterial samples comprised of four periodontal sites with probing depth > 5 mm each, were collected from each individual. The samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. The differences in bacterial counts using the Mann Whitney U test were statistically significant for Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter concisus, Eikenella corrodens, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides forsythus, Bacteroides gracilis, Campylobacter rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Selenomonas sputigena and Candida albicans in smokers. Statistically significant differences for Peptostreptococcus micros, Actinomyces naeslundii, Eubacterium lentum and Capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in non-smokers. The isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora like E. coli, C. albicans and S. aureus in smokers microflora underscores the importance of the host which is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.
TI  - Associations between microbial species in dental root canal infections.
AB  - The existence of commensal or antagonistic relationships between microorganisms in the root canals of teeth with apical periodontitis was investigated. Samples were taken from 65 infected human root canals and were analysed according to species, frequency of occurrence and proportion of the total isolated flora. The most frequent species were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Peptostreptococcus micros, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Eubacterium alactolyticum, Eubacterium lentum and Wolinella recta. An odds ratio system was used to calculate positive or negative associations between the isolated bacteria. Strong positive associations were found between F. nucleatum and P. micros, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Selenomonas sputigena and W. recta. There was also a positive association between P. intermedia and P. micros, P. anaerobius and the eubacteria. In general, species of streptococci, Propionibacterium propionica, Capnocytophaga ochracea and Veillonella parvula showed no or negative associations with the other bacteria. The results are consistent with the concept of a special and selective environment occurring in the root canal that is due, in part, to the cooperative as well as antagonistic nature of the relationships between bacteria in the root canal.
TI  - Isolation and purification of bacteriocin from Prevotella intermedia (Bacteroides intermedius).
AB  - Thirty-three out of 46 strains of Prevotella intermedia (Bacteroides intermedius) isolated from gingival deposits of patients with adult periodontitis possessed the ability to inhibit growth of P. intermedia strain ATCC 25611, and 6 of the 33 showed strong inhibitory activity. Thirteen isolates did not have the ability to inhibit the growth of P. intermedia strain ATCC 25611. An inhibition factor from one of the isolates, P. intermedia TH14 which had strong inhibition, was purified and characterized. Bacteriocin TH14 activity was effective against only P. intermedia ATCC 25611 and Fusobacterium nucleatum, but not against other crevicular bacteria, including P. intermedia ATCC 33563, Porphyromonas gingivalis (Bacteroides gingivalis), Capnocytophaga sputigena and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Streptococci, actinomyces, and veillonellas were not inhibited by bacteriocin TH14. Bacteriocin TH14 was heat sensitive, proteinaceous with molecular weight of 1,700 daltons and inhibited the growth of strain ATCC 25611 in 15 minutes. The growth inhibition of P. intermedia ATCC 25611 by bacteriocin TH14 was found to be due to the bactericidal activity of the bacteriocin.
TI  - Effects of chlorhexidine on proteolytic and glycosidic enzyme activities of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  - Chlorhexidine was tested for its ability to inhibit a wide range of glycosidic and proteolytic enzyme activities produced by Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Actinobacillus actinomycemcomitans, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Capnocytophaga orchracea, Capnocytophaga sp., Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus mitior, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus sanguis. The enzymes produced by Capnocytophaga spp. were the most resistant to inhibition by chlorhexidine while the hydrolysis of proteolytic substrates by all the other species was markedly susceptible to inhibition with less than 0.125 mM chlorhexidine inhibiting enzyme activities by greater than or equal to 50%. Glycosidase activities, of all species, were generally more resistant to inhibition, especially neuraminidase activity. Chlorhexidine at less than 0.032 mM inhibited the degradation of bovine serum albumin by suspensions of dental plaque bacteria. These observations support an hypothesis that chlorhexidine exerts a bacteristatic effect in vivo, in part, by reducing the ability of dental plaque bacteria to degrade host-derived proteins and glycoproteins which normally provide essential nutrients for growth.
TI  - [Bacteriological study on juvenile periodontitis].
AB  - The predominant cultivable microflora of 23 pockets in 15 juvenile periodontitis  (JP) patients was studied for the first time in China using the current anaerobic methodology. Samples were taken with sterile paper points and dispersed on a vortex mixer. Then the diluted samples were plated on the non-selective blood agar plates and selective MGB medium which favors the growth of Actinobacillus actimycetemcomitans (Aa) and incubated in anaerobic chamber for 5 days. From each sample 15 or more isolated colonies were picked in sequence without selection and subcultured. The isolates were identified mainly by Schrechenberger's 4 hour rapid methods for biochemical and fermentative tests and the chromatographic analysis of acid end products using ion-chromatography. The results were as follows: 1. The microflora of healthy sulci of 7 healthy young subjects was significantly different from that in the pocket of JP patients. The predominant species in healthy sulci were Streptococcus spp and Capnocytophaga gingivalis. 2. The species increased significantly in JP patients in prevalence and proportions was Eubacterium. Other species in high proportions were Bacteroides oris, B. melaninogenicus, B. gingivalis, Capnocytophaga sputigena, and Actinomyces meyeri, etc. 3. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any of the samples.
TI  - Microbiological and immunological aspects of experimental periodontal disease in  rats: a review article.
AB  - Animal models in which microbiological and immunological aspects of periodontal disease can be studied prospectively seem well warranted. The rat bears much resemblance to man with respect to periodontal anatomy, development and composition of dental plaque, histopathology of periodontal lesions, and basic immunobiology. Furthermore, reproducible methods are available for assessment of periodontal disease in rats, and detectable periodontal destruction can be induced in a few weeks in these animals without traumatizing periodontal tissues with ligatures. Experimental periodontitis studies in germ-free rats have confirmed the pathogenicity of several suspected periodontal pathogens (Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eikenella corrodens, and Fusobacterium nucleatum). The studies also suggest that the number of periodontal pathogens may be higher than generally believed, since species like Streptococcus sobrinus and Actinomyces viscosus are associated with periodontal bone loss in rats. Studies in rats with congenital or induced immune defects indicate that generalized or selective immunosuppression at the time of infection with periodontal pathogens may aggravate periodontal disease. Studies in immunized rats indicate that periodontal disease can be prevented by immunization against periodontal pathogens. However, it is also possible by immunization to induce periodontal destruction; i.e., the immune system has a destructive potential which should not be overlooked. In the future, the rat model may prove valuable for initial screening of antigen preparations and immunization regimens in the search for a periodontitis vaccine.
TI  - Coaggregation of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Selenomonas flueggei, Selenomonas infelix, Selenomonas noxia, and Selenomonas sputigena with strains from 11 genera of oral bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-eight strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum and 41 Selenomonas strains, including S. sputigena (24 strains), S. flueggei (10 strains), S. infelix (5 strains), and S. noxia (2 strains), were tested for their ability to coaggregate with each other and with 49 other strains of oral bacteria representing Actinobacillus, Actinomyces, Bacteroides, Capnocytophaga, Gemella, Peptostreptococcus, Porphyromonas, Propionibacterium, Rothia, Streptococcus, and Veillonella species. Selenomonads coaggregated with fusobacteria and with Actinomyces naeslundii PK984 but not with any of the other bacteria, including other selenomonads. In contrast, fusobacteria coaggregated with members of all genera, although not with all strains of each species tested. Each fusobacterium strain appeared to have its own set of partners and coaggregation properties, unlike their partners, whose coaggregation properties in earlier surveys delineated distinct coaggregation groups. Coaggregations of fusobacteria with the 63 gram-negative strains were usually inhibited by EDTA, whereas those with the 27 gram-positive strains were usually not inhibited. Likewise, lactose-inhibitable coaggregations were common among some strains of fusobacteria and some strains from each of the genera containing gram-negative partners but were rarely observed with gram-positive partners. Heating the fusobacteria at 85 degrees C for 30 min completely prevented coaggregation with most partners, suggesting the involvement of a protein on the fusobacteria. Heat treatment of many of the gram-negative partners not only enhanced their coaggregation with the fusobacteria but also changed lactose-sensitive coaggregations to lactose-insensitive coaggregations. Although fusobacteria coaggregated with a broader variety of oral partner strains than any other group of oral bacteria tested to date, each fusobacterium exhibited coaggregation with only a certain set of partner strains, and none of the fusobacteria adhered to other strains of fusobacteria, indicating that recognition of partner cell surfaces is selective. The strains of F. nucleatum are heterogeneous and cannot be clustered into distinct coaggregation groups. Collectively, these results indicate that coaggregation between fusobacteria and many gram-negative partners is significantly different from their coaggregation with gram-positive partners. The contrasting variety of partners for fusobacteria and selenomonads supports the concept of coaggregation partner specificity that has been observed with every genus of oral bacteria so far examined.
TI  - Bactericidal concentrations of chlorhexidine-digluconate, amine fluoride gel and  stannous fluoride gel for subgingival bacteria tested in serum at short contact times.
AB  - In vitro inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations in serum of chlorhexidine-digluconate, amine fluoride gel, stannous fluoride gel, stannous fluoride, metronidazole and amoxicillin were determined against Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Capnocytophaga sputigena. The minimal inhibitory concentration was assessed by the agar dilution technique. The killing curves and minimal bactericidal concentration of the antimicrobial agents in inactivated bovine serum were determined after 5, 10, 20 and 60 minutes contact time. The minimal inhibitory concentration varied amongst the tested bacteria. A concentration of 128 micrograms/ml chlorhexidine digluconate, 20 mg/ml amine fluoride gel, 1 mg/ml stannous fluoride, 128 micrograms/ml metronidazole and 4 micrograms/ml amoxicillin inhibited the growth of the tested species. The minimal bactericidal concentration in serum for B. gingivalis, B. intermedius, F. nucleatum, A. actinomycetemcomitans and C. sputigena after 10 min contact time was 5 mg/ml for chlorhexidine digluconate and 100 mg/ml for amine fluoride gel. A concentration of 200 mg/ml stannous fluoride gel in serum was bactericidal for the tested species after 10 min contact time, with exception of F. nucleatum.
TI  - The comparative cytotoxicity of periodontal bacteria.
AB  - The direct cytotoxicity of sonic extracts (SE) from nine periodontal bacteria for human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) was compared. Equivalent dosages (in terms of protein concentration) of SE were used to challenge HGF cultures. The cytotoxic potential of each SE was assessed by its ability to (1) inhibit HGF proliferation, as measured by direct cell counts; (2) inhibit 3H-thymidine incorporation in HGF cultures; or (3) cause morphological alterations of the cells in challenged cultures. The highest concentration (500 micrograms SE protein/ml) of any of the SEs used to challenge the cells was found to be markedly inhibitory to the HGFs by all three of the criteria of cytotoxicity. At the lowest dosage tested (50 micrograms SE protein/ml); only SE from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides gingivalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum caused a significant effect (greater than 90% inhibition or overt morphological abnormalities) in the HGFs as determined by any of the criteria employed. SE from Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eikenella corrodens, or Wolinella recta also inhibited cell proliferation and thymidine incorporation at this dosage; however, the degree of inhibition (5-50%) was consistently, clearly less than that of the first group of three organisms named above. The SE of the three other organisms tested (Actinomyces odontolyticus, Bacteroides intermedius, and Streptococcus sanguis) had little or no effect (0-10% inhibition) at this concentration. The data suggest that the outcome of the interaction between bacterial components and normal resident cells of the periodontium is, at least in part, a function of the bacterial species.
TI  - Early microbial colonization of permucosal implants in edentulous patients.
AB  - In edentulous patients, the microbial colonization of permucosal implants of sintered hydroxyapatite was studied. Samples were taken from mucosa and dentures before insertion of implants and from supra- and subgingival sites two to 10 weeks after insertion. In total, five patients and 10 implants with clinically healthy peri-implant tissues were studied. The samples were investigated by dark-field microscopy and anaerobic culture. The supragingival plaque of the implants was dominated by Gram-positive cocci and rods, the subgingival plaque by Haemophilus spp. and Veillonella parvula. A group of bacteria was found specifically related to the implants: Actinomyces odontolyticus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, Capnocytophaga sputigena, and Leptotrichia buccalis. Black-pigmented Bacteroides was not found in any of the examined samples. Spirochetes were observed in denture plaque samples and in supragingival plaque of the implants. It is concluded that bacteria known as potential periodontal pathogens colonize the permucosal implants in the first weeks after insertion. The presence of these species seems to be dependent on the ecological factors provided by the artificial gingival crevice of the permucosal implants in the edentulous mouth.
TI  - Coaggregation of oral Bacteroides species with other bacteria: central role in coaggregation bridges and competitions.
AB  - Seventy-three freshly isolated oral strains representing 10 Bacteroides spp. were tested for their ability to coaggregate with other oral gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. None coaggregated with any of the gram-negative strains tested, which included Capnocytophaga gingivalis, C. ochracea, C. sputigena, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Strains of Bacteroides buccae, B. melaninogenicus, B. oralis, and B. gingivalis failed to coaggregate with any of the gram-positive strains tested. However, six Bacteroides spp. coaggregated with one or more species of gram-positive bacteria. Most isolates of B. buccalis, B. denticola, B. intermedius, B. loescheii, B. oris, and B. veroralis coaggregated with strains of Actinomyces israelii, A. viscosus, A. naeslundii, A. odontolyticus, Rothia dentocariosa, or Streptococcus sanguis. The strongest coaggregations involved B. denticola, B. loescheii, or B. oris; 22 of 25 strains coaggregated with A. israelii. Only B. loescheii interacted with certain strains of S. sanguis; these coaggregations were lactose inhibitable and were like coaggregations between A. viscosus and the same strains of S. sanguis. In fact, B. loescheii and A. viscosus were competitors for binding to S. sanguis. Many bacteroides also acted as coaggregation bridges by mediating coaggregations between two noncoaggregating cell types (e.g., S. sanguis and A. israelii). Evidence for binding-site competition and coaggregation bridging involving noncoaggregating cell types from three different genera provides support for the hypothesis that these intergeneric cell-to-cell interactions have an active role in bacterial colonization of the oral cavity.
TI  - Sodium fluoride susceptibilities of suspected periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - Utilizing a blood-based medium, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) to sodium fluoride (NaF) of 45 bacterial strains representing 22 oral species. Bacterial susceptibility ranged from 128 micrograms/ml to 2048 micrograms/ml. Of those organisms tested, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Capnocytophaga ochracea, and Actinomyces viscosus were susceptible at lower levels of NaF.
TI  - Ultrasonic dispersion of pure cultures of plaque bacteria and plaque.
AB  - This study compared the sonic sensitivity of 12 Gram-negative and two Gram-positive bacteria commonly encountered in plaque associated with periodontal diseases. Pure bacterial cultures were grown to standard turbidity, diluted in 1/4 strength prereduced anaerobically sterilized Ringer's solution, and aliquots dispersed for 0-180 s, using an MSE sonic oscillator at 6 micron under 80% N2, 10% H2 and 10% CO2. Viable recoveries were determined on anaerobically cultured trypticase soy 5% blood agar plates. Breakage of T. denticola was assessed by electron microscopy. Gram-positive organisms tolerated sonication better than Gram-negative. A. viscous was more resistant than Strep sanguis. Gram-negative bacteria could be divided into groups according to their sensitivity. Eikenella corrodens was most resistant, followed by F. nucleatum B asaccharolyticus, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, A actinomycetemcomitans, a strain (2097) of Group IV Bacteroides, and B melaninogenicus ss intermedius resisted sonication better than "corroding' Bacteroides and oral Campylobacter. T. denticola, Selenomonas sputigena and Wolinella were most sensitive with viable counts which declined after sonication for 5-10 s. Recoveries from plaque taken from five patients with periodontal diseases increased with sonication time, reaching higher values for suprangingival than for subgingival samples.
