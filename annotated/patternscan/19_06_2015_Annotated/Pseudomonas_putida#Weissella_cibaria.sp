TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics of microbial communities during back-slop soaking of soybeans as determined by pcr-dgge and molecular cloning.
AB  == tempe is a traditional fermented food in indonesia. the manufacture process is quite complex, which comprises two stages, preparatory soaking of soybeans and fungal solid state fermentation. daily addition of previous soak water (back-slopping) during the soybean soaking step is considered to be crucial in the manufacture of high quality tempe. the microbial diversity and dynamics of the microbial communities evolving during back-slop soaking of soybeans for tempe making was investigated by culture-independent pcr-dgge and molecular cloning. both dna and total rna were isolated and included in this study, to obtain a view on the succession of total and viable bacteria in the complex microbiota. dgge profiles indicated that enterobacter sp., enterococcus sp., pseudomonas putida, leuconostoc fallax, pediococcus pentosaceus, and weissella cibaria, were the predominant bacteria. their occurrence shifted dramatically during the back-slop  soaking procedure. this study combined with previous culture-dependent studies could gain a better understanding of the complex microbiota of traditional fermented food and give useful information for its quality control.
