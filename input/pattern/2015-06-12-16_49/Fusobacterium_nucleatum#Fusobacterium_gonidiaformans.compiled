TI  - Identification of a 43-kDa outer membrane protein of Fusobacterium necrophorum that exhibits similarity with pore-forming proteins of other Fusobacterium species.
AB  - A pair of primers was designed in an attempt to amplify outer membrane protein (OMP) gene of Fusobacterium necrophorum based on nucleotide sequence of the OMP of Fusobacterium nucleatum. Further analysis was performed to characterize its molecular properties and phylogeny in the genus Fusobacterium. We identified a predicated 43kDa outer membrane protein (43K OMP) in F. necrophorum, which showed the same properties as other pore-forming proteins of Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria according to analysis of signal peptide, AT-rich, membrane-spanning region and conserved motifs. The predicated 43K OMP exhibited 70.22%, 62.04%, 56.75%, 58.72%, 51.59%, 31.49% and 50.26% amino acid identity with the OMPs of F. nucleatum, Fusobacterium varium, Fusobacterium ucerans, Fusobacterium periodonticum, Fusobacterium mortiferum, Fusobacterium gonidiaformans and F. necrophorum (hypothetical protein), respectively. 11 common conserved domains and 10 common variable domains were found among the 45 aligned OMPs of Fusobacterium species. Distributions of the conserved and variable domains were highly associated with predicted membrane-spanning regions, cell surface exposed regions and B-cell epitope regions. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the predicated 43K OMP of F. necrophorum was closely related with the OMPs from F. nucleatum and F. periodonticum. These data will increase understanding of pathogenesis and genetic evolution of F. necrophorum.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a novel adhesin unique to oral fusobacteria.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a gram-negative anaerobe that is prevalent in periodontal disease and infections of different parts of the body. The organism has remarkable adherence properties, binding to partners ranging from eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells to extracellular macromolecules. Understanding its adherence is important for understanding the pathogenesis of F. nucleatum. In this study, a novel adhesin, FadA (Fusobacterium adhesin A), was demonstrated to bind to the surface proteins of the oral mucosal KB cells. FadA is composed of 129 amino acid (aa) residues, including an 18-aa signal peptide, with calculated molecular masses of 13.6 kDa for the intact form and 12.6 kDa for the secreted form. It is highly conserved among F. nucleatum, Fusobacterium periodonticum, and Fusobacterium simiae, the three most closely related oral species, but is absent in the nonoral species, including Fusobacterium gonidiaformans, Fusobacterium mortiferum, Fusobacterium naviforme, Fusobacterium russii, and Fusobacterium ulcerans. In addition to FadA, F. nucleatum ATCC 25586 and ATCC 49256 also encode two paralogues, FN1529 and FNV2159, each sharing 31% identity with FadA. A double-crossover fadA deletion mutant, F. nucleatum 12230-US1, was constructed by utilizing a novel sonoporation procedure. The mutant had a slightly slower growth rate, yet its binding to KB and Chinese hamster ovarian cells was reduced by 70 to 80% compared to that of the wild type, indicating that FadA plays an important role in fusobacterial colonization in the host. Furthermore, due to its uniqueness to oral Fusobacterium species, fadA may be used as a marker to detect orally related fusobacteria. F. nucleatum isolated from other parts of the body may originate from the oral cavity.
TI  - Fusobacterial infections in children.
AB  - A total of 243 strains of Fusobacteria species was recovered from 226 of 1399 (16%) specimens obtained from 213 children. The strains included 65 (27%) Fusobacterium sp., 144 (59%) Fusobacterium nucleatum, 25 (10%) Fusobacterium necrophorum, five (2%) Fusobacterium varium, three (1%) Fusobacterium mortiferum, and one (0.4%) Fusobacterium gonidiaformans. Most Fusobacteria species were recovered from patients with abscesses (100), aspiration pneumonia (24), paronychia (15), bites (14), chronic sinusitis (ten), chronic otitis media (nine), and osteomyelitis (eight). Predisposing conditions were noted in 32 (15%) of the cases. These included immunodeficiency in nine (4%), steroid therapy in eight (4%), previous surgery in six (3%), diabetes in six (3%) and malignant neoplasms in five (2%). Fusobacteria sp. was the only isolate in 16 (8%) instances while mixed infections were encountered in 197 (92%) patients. The organisms most commonly isolated with Fusobacteria sp. were anaerobic cocci (155), pigmented Prevotella sp. and Porphyromonas sp. (95), Bacteroides fragilis group (80), Escherichia coli (43) and Bacteroides sp. (39). Most strains of B. fragilis group and E. coli were recovered from intra-abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections proximal to the rectal area. Most pigmented Prevotella sp. and Porphyromonas sp. were recovered from oropharyngeal and pulmonary sites and from sites around the head and neck. Antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients; surgical drainage was performed in 85 (40%). All patients, except two who died, recovered. These findings illustrate the prevalence of Fusobacteria sp. associated with infections in children.
TI  - Sugar metabolism by fusobacteria: regulation of transport, phosphorylation, and polymer formation by Fusobacterium mortiferum ATCC 25557.
AB  - Strains of eight Fusobacterium species differed in the ability to use sugars as energy sources for growth. For Fusobacterium russii ATCC 25533, F. gonidiaformans ATCC 25563, and F. nucleatum ATCC 10953 (except for fructose), growth was marginal to poor on all of the sugars tested. Other species displayed reasonable growth on glucose, fructose, mannose, and galactose, and two strains of F. mortiferum (ATCC 25557 and ATCC 9817) grew well on six of the sugars tested, including sucrose and maltose. Glucose transport by resting cells of most of the species was dependent upon (or markedly stimulated by) the presence of a fermentable amino acid. By contrast, F. mortiferum cells rapidly accumulated glucose and other sugars in the absence of amino acids. Although these cells were constitutive for glucose uptake, accumulation of other sugars was specifically induced by growth of F. mortiferum on the appropriate sugar. Spectrophotometric analyses and in situ staining of anionic polyacrylamide gels showed that glucose and fructose (mannose) are phosphorylated by separate ATP-dependent kinases. Fructokinase was stable in air at 4 degrees C, but under these conditions, greater than 70% of the glucokinase activity was lost. After overnight dialysis of the extract, no glucokinase activity was detectable; however, 65% of the initial enzyme activity was retained by inclusion of 1 mM dithiothreitol in the dialysis buffer. Thin-section electron microscopy showed that cells of F. mortiferum produced various amounts of intracellular glycogen during growth on the following sugars (in decreasing order of formation): galactose greater than sucrose greater than glucose greater than mannose greater than fructose. Mechanisms for sugar transport regulation, phosphorylation, and polymer synthesis by F. mortiferum cells are proposed.
TI  - Intrageneric relationships of members of the genus Fusobacterium as determined by reverse transcriptase sequencing of small-subunit rRNA.
AB  - The phylogenetic interrelationships of 14 members of the genus Fusobacterium were investigated by performing a comparative analysis of the 16S rRNA sequences of these organisms. The sequence data revealed considerable intrageneric heterogeneity. The four species Fusobacterium nucleatum (including F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, "F. nucleatum subsp. fusiforme," and "F. nucleatum subsp. animalis"), Fusobacterium alocis, Fusobacterium periodonticum, and Fusobacterium simiae, which colonize oral cavities, exhibited high levels of sequence homology with each other and formed a distinct group within the genus. Fusobacterium mortiferum, Fusobacterium varium, and Fusobacterium ulcerans also formed a phylogenetically coherent group, as did the two species Fusobacterium gonidiaformans and Fusobacterium necrophorum. Fusobacterium russii and Fusobacterium necrogenes displayed no specific relationship with any of the other fusobacteria. The sequence data are discussed in the context of previous physiological and chemical findings.
TI  - A pyrolysis mass spectrometry study of fusobacteria.
AB  - Strains of fusobacteria (143) were examined by pyrolysis mass spectrometry (Py-MS) with a Horizon Instruments PYMS 200X. Fusobacterium necrogenes, F. necrophorum, F. nucleatum, F. mortiferum, F. varium, F. gonidiaformans, F. naviforme, F. russii and Leptotrichia buccalis were discriminated. Strains of fusobacteria isolated from tropical ulcers, although similar to F. mortiferum in conventional tests, were discriminated from each of these species in Py-MS. Identification of 416 spectra to species level agreed with conventional bacteriological methods in 91.8% of cases, was equivocal in 3.4% and disagreed in 4.8%. Classification based on pyrolysis data resolved groups largely corresponding to the recognised species. However, F. nucleatum strains were divided between two distinct groups. The tropical ulcer strains were resolved as a distinct homogeneous group. Py-MS is a rapid, inexpensive and convenient procedure for characterisation of bacteria, with the capacity for a high throughput of samples, although the initial cost of the apparatus is high.
TI  - Composition of peptidoglycans in Bacteroidaceae: determination and distribution of lanthionine.
AB  - Peptidoglycans of organisms belonging to the strictly anaerobic family Bacteroidaceae were investigated for the presence of lanthionine. Different procedures for the quantitation of lanthionine were compared. Performic acid and peroxide oxidation procedures on 35S-labeled peptidoglycan from Fusobacterium nucleatum Fev1 resulted in low yields of cysteic acid (42 and 60%, respectively) and many other additional unidentified oxidation products. Lanthionine was, however, recovered in high yield (89% or more) from acid hydrolysates of unoxidized peptidoglycans. Lanthionine was found exclusively in some species of Fusobacterium, in particular F. nucleatum, F. necrophorum, F. russi, and F. gonidiaformans, for which lanthionine may be ascribed a function as a taxonomic marker. Peptidoglycans of these bacteria are thus proposed to belong to a new chemotype, assigned A1 delta. One strain of Fusobacterium, F. mortiferum VPI 0473 contained both lanthionine and diaminopimelic acid in about equal proportions. Species of F.plauti had a composition atypic of gram-negative cells. Chemotypic differences were also indicated among the species of Bacteroides investigated. Thus, some species contained lysine and not diaminopimelic acid as the major dibasic amino acid (e.g., F. asaccharolyticus). It is concluded that peptidoglycans of gram-negative organisms constitute a somewhat more heterogeneous group than hitherto assumed.
TI  - Gram-negative anaerobic bacilli: Their role in infection and patterns of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. II. Little-known Fusobacterium species and miscellaneous genera.
AB  - Twenty infrequently reported species of gram-negative anaerobic bacilli other than Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium necrophorum, and members of the genus Bacteroides were studied with regard to their role in infection and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. In addition, the literature regarding the recovery of these organisms from both the normal flora and infections of humans was reviewed. During a six-year period at the Wadsworth Clinical Anaerobic Bacteriology Research Laboratory (Veterans Administration Wadsworth Medical Center, Los Angeles, Calif.), 39 (6%) of 679 specimens obtained from anaerobic infections yielded "other gram-negative anaerobic bacilli" (OGNAB). Fusobacterium naviforme, Fusobacterium gonidiaformans, Fusobacterium varium, Fusobacterium mortiferum, and Fusobacterium russii were the most commonly isolated OGNAB. Most of the OGNAB tested were resistant to erythromycin, and most strains, except for F. varium, were susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics and clindamycin. Chloramphenicol and metronidazole were active against all strains of OGNAB tested. Certain Fusobacterium species are undoubtedly previously unrecognized members of the normal flora of the oropharynx, upper respiratory tract, or urogenital tract and may be present in infections derived from these floras.
TI  - Fatty acids of Fusobacterium species: taxonomic implications.
AB  - Fatty acids of Fusobacterium species were examined by gas-liquid chromatography.  Fusobacterium nucleatum, F. necrophorum, F. mortiferum, F. gonidiaformans and F. varium showed similar patterns, characterized by the presence of 3-hydroxytetradecanoate, n-tetradecanoate, hexadecenoate, n-hexadeconoate, ocadecenoate, n-octadecanoate and a component having the properties of octadecadienoate. Fusobacterium nucleatum contained 3-hydroxyhexadecanoate as a distinctive character. Simpler fatty acid patterns characterized by the absence of 3-hydroxytetradecanoate and other hydroxy fatty acids were observed in F. plauti, the single strain of F. prausnitzii and in the majority of strains classified as F. russii and F. naviforme. Neither methyl-branched nor cyclopropane fatty acids could be detected in any of the strains examined. In addition to fatty acid methyl esters, the chromatographic profiles of all species except F. mortiferum, F. gonidiaformans and F. naviforme contained substantial amounts of fatty aldehyde dimethyl acetals of chain lengths C14 to C18.
TI  - Fatty acids and neutral sugars present in lipopolysaccharides isolated from Fusobacterium species.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) extracted from cells of Fusobacterium necrophorum, F. mortiferum, F. Gonidiaformans. varium and single strains of F. naviforme and F. russi were analysed for sugars and fatty acids. All preparations contained a monosaccharide tentatively identified as L-glycero-D-mannoheptose, but showed variation with respect to the presence of glucose, galactose, rhamnose and another heptose isomer, tentatively identified as L-glycero-D-mannoheptose. L-glycero-D-mannoheptose was a monosaccharide of great abundance in all LPS examined. 2-keto-3-deoxy-octonate and glucosamine were present in all LPS preparations. The fatty acids present were 3-hydroxy-tetradecanoic acid as the main component, and n-tetradecanoic acid. Some LPS contained n-hexadecanoic acid. All the strains of F. nucleatum contained 3-hydroxy-hexadecanoic acid as a group-specific LPS constituent.
