TI  == environmental bacteria and childhood asthma.
AB  == background: we have previously found an inverse association of bacterial diversity with childhood asthma. it remains unclear whether certain bacteria account for the protective effect. methods: the high variability of the bacterial 16s rrna gene allows assessing diversity and specificity of bacterial communities by single-strand configuration polymorphism (sscp). dna was extracted from mattress dust samples of 489 school-age children from rural and suburban regions  in germany. a fragment of the bacteria-specific 16s rrna gene was amplified by pcr, digested to single-strand dna, and subjected to electrophoresis. the resulting band patterns reflect the underlying dna sequences. the individual bands were tested for associations with asthma, hay fever, and atopy in quantitative and qualitative multivariable analyses. significantly associated bands were isolated and sequenced. the sequences were compared to a database, and distinct bacteria were identified. results: seven of 76 independent bands were found to be inversely associated with asthma, atopic sensitization, and hay fever with odds ratios ranging from 0.17 to 0.73. the bands contained the sequences of  acinetobacter sp., lactobacillus spp., neisseria spp., staphylococcus sciuri, jeotgalicoccus sp., corynebacterium spp., and others. conclusions: in a diverse microbial environment, certain bacteria may account for the protective effect on  the development of asthma and atopy.

TI  == employment of broad-range 16s rrna pcr to detect aetiological agents of infection from clinical specimens in patients with acute meningitis--rapid separation of 16s rrna pcr amplicons without the need for cloning.
AB  == aims: the aim of this study was to develop a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page) method for the rapid separation of 16s rrna pcr amplicons from aetiological agents of acute meningitis. methods and results: blood samples from  40 patients with suspected acute meningococcal meningitis were examined for the presence of causal agents, including neisseria meningitidis employing two methods: (i) broad-range 16s rrna pcr in conjunction with page and automated sequencing and (ii) species-specific pcr employing abi taqman technology for n. meningitidis. analysis of clinical specimens employing 16s rrna pcr yielded 33/40 (82.5%) positive for the presence of bacterial dna. species-specific pcr yielded  30/40 (75%) clinical specimens positive for n. meningitidis. prior to separation  by page, only 6/33 (18.2%) amplicons were able to be identified by sequence analysis, the remaining amplicons (n=27) did not yield an identification due to the presence of mixed 16s rrna pcr amplicons. following separation, amplicons were re-amplified and sequenced, yielding 24/27 (88.9%) positive for n. meningitidis and three specimens positive for acinetobacter sp., staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. one specimen was positive for both n. meningitidis and streptococcus spp. and another specimen was positive for n. meningitidis and pseudomonas sp., by broad-range pcr. seven clinical specimens were negative for n. meningitidis and other eubacteria using both detection techniques. conclusions: clinical specimens including blood and cerebrospinal fluid from patients with suspected acute bacterial meningitis, may become contaminated with commensal skin flora, resulting in difficulties in downstream sequencing of pathogen plus contaminant dna. this study allows for the rapid separation of amplified pathogen from contaminant dna. significance and impact of study: this study demonstrated the usefulness of the rapid separation of multiple 16s rrna pcr amplicons using a combination of page and automated sequencing, without the need of cloning. adoption of this technique is therefore proposed when trying to rapidly identify pathogens in clinical specimens employing broad-range 16s rrna pcr.

TI  == natural transformation in mesophilic and thermophilic bacteria: identification and characterization of novel, closely related competence genes in acinetobacter  sp. strain bd413 and thermus thermophilus hb27.
AB  == the mesophile acinetobacter sp. strain bd413 and the extreme thermophile thermus  thermophilus hb27 display high frequencies of natural transformation. in this study we identified and characterized a novel competence gene in acinetobacter sp. strain bd413, coma, whose product displays significant similarities to the competence proteins coma and comec in neisseria and bacillus species. transcription of coma correlated with growth phase-dependent transcriptional regulation of the recently identified pilin-like factors of the transformation machinery. this finding strongly suggests that coma is part of a competence regulon. examination of the genome sequence of t. thermophilus hb27 led to detection of a coma/comec-like open reading frame (orf) which is flanked by an orf whose product shows significant similarities to the bacillus subtilis competence protein comea. to examine whether these two orfs, designated comec and comea, are implicated in natural transformation of t. thermophilus hb27, both were disrupted by using a thermostable kanamycin resistance marker. natural transformation in comec mutants was reduced 1,000-fold, whereas in comea mutants  the natural transformation phenotype was completely eliminated. these results strongly suggest that both genes, comec and comea, are required for natural transformation in t. thermophilus hb27. several transmembrane alpha-helices are predicted based on the amino acid sequences of coma in acinetobacter sp. strain bd413 and comec in t. thermophilus hb27, which suggests that coma and comec are located in the inner membrane and function in dna transport through the cytoplasmic membrane.

TI  == 16s rdna-based identification of bacteria from conjunctival swabs by pcr and dgge fingerprinting.
AB  == purpose: establishment of a new molecular biology technique for the identification of multiple bacteria from the ocular environment, which can be applied supplementarily to cultivation in cases of severe bacterial infections. methods: from 60 human conjunctivae (29 with purulent and 31 with nonpurulent conjunctivitis), swabs were taken and dna was extracted. fragments of 200 bp, spanning the v3 region of the eubacterial 16s rdna, were amplified by polymerase  chain reaction (pcr) and separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). for phylogenetic identification, dgge bands were excised and directly sequenced, or 16s rdna clone libraries were constructed and clones were screened  by dgge. sequences were compared with sequences of known bacteria listed in the embl database. furthermore, the results were compared with results obtained from  conventional cultivation. results: 16s rdna could be amplified from 25 of 29 investigated swabs taken from purulent conjunctivitis eyes and from 2 of 31 investigated swabs taken from nonpurulent conjunctivitis eyes. sixteen samples showed monomicrobial and 11 samples showed polymicrobial infections. the following genera (n is number of samples) were detected: staphylococcus (n = 8),  corynebacterium (n = 7), propionibacterium (n = 7), streptococcus (n = 6), bacillus (n = 2), acinetobacter (n = 3), pseudomonas (n = 3), proteus (n = 1), and brevundimonas (n = 1). four sequences could not be identified to the genus level. they had highest sequence similarities both to sequences of pantoea and enterobacter (n = 1), kingella and neisseria (n = 1), serratia and aranicola (n = 1), and leuconostoc and weissella (n = 2), respectively. culture was only positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9), corynebacteria (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), streptococcus sp. (n = 1), proteus sp. (n = 1), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1). in total, 45% of  the 60 analyzed conjunctival swabs were pcr positive, whereas only 22% were culture positive. no sample positive by culture gave negative results by pcr. conclusions: 16s rdna sequence analyses and dgge fingerprinting are appropriate methods for the detection and identification of monomicrobial as well as polymicrobial ocular infections of bacteria that might not be detected by conventional cultivation.

TI  == cerebrospinal meningitis with the presence of acinetobacter spp.
AB  == the study was conducted on 16 strains of acinetobacter sp. which were isolated from cerebrospinal fluid. the diagnostic material was analysed with the use of automatic bact/alert system (organon teknika). the analysis was performed in the  department of microbiology, medical university in bydgoszcz. api 20ne system (biomerieux) enabled the identification of 14 strains (87.5%) as a. baumannii, 1  strain as a. haemolyticus and 1 strain as a. lwoffii. the micro-organisms were isolated from patients whose age ranged between 4 and 66 years. these patients were treated in the departments of neurosurgery (75.0%), neurology (18.8%) and intensive therapy (6.2%). the infection of cerebrospinal fluid was caused by injury and subsequent exposure to the bacteria present in external environment. antibiotic-sensitivity of these micro-organisms was evaluated with the help of disc-diffusion method, observing standardisation conditions outlined by nccls. all the strains proved sensitive to carbapenems, 15 strains were sensitive to netilmicin, 7 strains--to tobramycin and 7 strains--to amikacin. all the strains  displayed multiple resistance. the only exception was a. haemolyticus. the use of two-discs allowed for the detection of esbls in 7 a. baumannii strains. positive  results were most frequently obtained after the combination of sublactam and aztreonam. due to microscopic resemblance between acinetobacter spp., and bacteria of neisseria, moraxella and haemophilus genus, microbiological diagnostics should not be restricted to microscopic assessment of cerebrospinal fluid and quick serological tests evaluating the antigens of the most frequent aetiological factors. considering multiple resistance of acinetobacter spp. to antibiotics, the treatment should be based on sensitivity tests and the ability of a given antibiotic to penetrate into cerebrospinal fluid. in our opinion, both reasonable antibiotic policy as well as observing the principles of hygiene and monitoring infections play equally important roles in the prevention of infections with acinetobacter spp. such combined measures may help to prevent the spreading of multiple resistant strains in hospital environment.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of ci-934 compared with that of other new 4-quinolones and  nalidixic acid.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of ci-934, a new 4-quinolone compound, was compared with that of the other new 4-quinolones, enoxacin and ciprofloxacin, and also with that of nalidixic acid. ci-934 was more active than any of the other 4-quinolones tested against gram-positive aerobic organisms including staphylococcus aureus (mics 0.06-0.25 mg/l), beta-haemolytic streptococci (mics 0.12-0.5 mg/l), streptococcus pneumoniae (mics 0.25-0.5 ml/l), viridans streptococci (mics 0.06-0.5 mg/l) and most enterococci (mics 0.12-0.5 mg/l), although some ampicillin-resistant isolates of str. faecium were slightly less susceptible (mics 2 mg/l). all three of the newer 4-quinolones tested were highly active against enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas sp., haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mics mostly less than 1 mg/l). the other gram-negative aerobes tested were in general somewhat less susceptible, although for acinetobacter and  pseudomonas aeruginosa mics seldom exceeded 8 mg/l. ci-934 was more active than enoxacin against gardnerella vaginalis (mics 1-8 mg/l) although it was a little less active than ciprofloxacin. bacteroides species (including about half of the  fragilis group) were susceptible to ci-934 (mics mostly 1-8 mg/l): ciprofloxacin  had similar activity but enoxacin was less active. other anaerobes tested were mostly highly susceptible to ci-934 (mics 1 mg/l or less) but were somewhat less  susceptible to enoxacin and ciprofloxacin.

TI  == [in vitro activity of a new 3d-generation cephalosporin, cefodizime, on hospital  bacteria].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefodizime were evaluated by agar dilution for 746 bacterial strains isolated in two hospitals. for enterobacteriaceae mics ranged from 0.008 micrograms/ml to more than 128 micrograms/ml (mode mic: 0.25); mode mics varied across species, ranging from 0.016 micrograms/ml for proteus mirabilis to 1 microgram/ml for citrobacter; mics ranged from 0.12 to 8 for most enterobacter and from 1 to 64 for serratia. the rare cefotaxime-resistant strains, most of which were citrobacter or enterobacter, also showed resistance to cefodizime. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter, with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128. haemophilus sp. and gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status, as well as neisseria meningitidis, were highly  susceptible (mic less than or equal to 0.008-0.016). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic: 2 to 16 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant. whereas the other streptococci and pneumococci had low  mics (0.03-0.12). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium (0.008 to 1) than for bacteroids (8 to 128 mu g/ml). our results show that cefodizime has the same properties as other third-generation cephalosporins: cefotaxime-resistant enterobacteriaceae strains also exhibit resistance to cefodizime.

TI  == [multicenter study of the in vitro effect of imipenem (n-formimidoyl-thienamycin) on hospital bacteria].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. imipenem proved highly active against enterobacteriaceae, with an mic less than or equal to 0.25  for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. the different groups of enterobacteriaceae exhibited  similar mode mics (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of serratia (0.25-0.5), p. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive proteus (2), and providencia (1). mics of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. imipenem also  exhibited satisfactory activity against p. aeruginosa (mode mic 1-2) and acinetobacter sp. (mode mic: 0.25-0.5). mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode mic: 0.5) for haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. mics for meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode mic : 0.016); mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely,  from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci, except for enterococci, and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); mics for enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode mic: 1-2). except  for four c. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode mics: 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for b. fragilis).

TI  == [in vitro activity of ceftriaxone on hospital bacteria. results of a multicenter  study].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. mics were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of enterobacteriaceae, with mode mics  varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for enterobacter. only a few resistant strains were  found, mainly among enterobacter and citrobacter. ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter (mode mics: 16 micrograms/ml). haemophilus sp. and gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic less than 0.008-0.032). ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other streptococci and pneumococci had low mics (0.03-0.25). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes (clostridium: 0.06-2, bacteroides: 0.5-32). our data show that its particularly strong activity against proteus, haemophilus and neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other  third-generation cephalosporins.

TI  == effect of saccharin on growth and acid production of glucose-grown pathogenic and oral bacteria.
AB  == growth and acid production of glucose-grown gram-positive and gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02  to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. all gram-positive rods, i.e. actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis and corynebacterium diphtheriae, and gram-positive cocci, i.e. streptococcus spp, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. while gram-negative cocci, i.e. veillonella sp and neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. saccharin caused a significant reduction  in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.

TI  == [multicenter study of the antibacterial activity of a new cephalosporin: cm 40874].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of cm were evaluated on 2 548 bacterial strains isolated in 8 hospitals. cm demonstrated high activity on enterobacteriaceae, the mic being less than or equal to 0.125 micrograms/ml for 71% of the 1 362 strains tested, less than or equal to 1 for 99.6%, and less than or equal to 4 for 99.9%. mode mic varies little among the different groups of enterobacteriaceae (from 0.06 to 0.12 micrograms/ml), with the exception of serratia sp. (mode mic : 0.25) and klebsiella oxytoca (mode mic : 0.03). most of  enterobacter, serratia, and citrobacter sp. strains not inhibited by cefotaxime are readily inhibited by cm at the same concentrations than susceptible strains.  cm has less activity on p. aeruginosa (mic 2-32 micrograms/ml) and acinetobacter  sp. (mic 8-128). staphylococci (mic 32) and enterococci are not susceptible. variable activity is found against other streptococci. cm inhibits haemophilus sp. at mics of 0.12 to 0.5 micrograms/ml and gonococci at mics of 0.03 to 0.5 (whether the strains produce beta-lactamase or not). meningococci have a mode mic of 0.03 micrograms/ml (range 0.008 to 0.25). thus, cm 40874 is a new third generation cephalosporin with high activity on enterobacteriaceae, including those strains not susceptible to cefotaxime and good activity on haemophilus sp.  and neisseria sp. this additional activity is probably supported by enhanced resistance to enzymatic inactivation by beta-lactamases.

AB  == the susceptibility to ceftizoxime of all bacterial strains isolated from seven university-affiliated hospitals over one month was tested with disk-diffusion technique. additionally, the mic of 1937 strains selected at random was evaluated by the agar dilution method. the majority of enterobacteriaceae are inhibited at  a concentration of less than 1 microgram/ml with a mode mic varying from 0.008 to 0.12 among the various groups. a few enterobacter and citrobacter strains are resistant. little activity was demonstrated by ceftizoxime on pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter sp. (mode mic 32 and 8 micrograms/ml respectively).  haemophilus sp. (mic 0.01-0.03) and neisseria (mic less than 0,008-0,016) are very susceptible to the drug. the mic of methicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococcus aureus varies from 1 to 4 micrograms/ml ; enterococci are less susceptible, whereas other streptococci and pneumococci have low mics (less than  0.008-0.025). the susceptibility of anaerobic pathogens varies widely between species, and within species ; mic ranges from 0.008 to 32 micrograms/ml for clostridium sp. and 0.25 to 128 micrograms/ml for bacteroides sp.

TI  == antigonococcal and antibacterial spectra of some bacterial isolates of the urogenital flora.
AB  == the antigonococcal and antibacterial spectra of bacterial isolates of the urogenital flora selected for their in vitro interference of neisseria gonorrhoeae growth were determined on solid medium. a broad antigonococcal spectrum was found for all the selected isolates when they were tested against gonococcal virulent (t1) strains, penicillinase producing strains and strains belonging to the auxotypes nr, thi-, pro- hyx-, pro- meth- thp-, arg- meth- and arg- hyx- ura-. except for the group d streptococci, all the selected isolates particularly the coagulase negative staphylococci showed a narrow interference spectrum towards aerobic and anaerobic bacterial representatives of the normal urogenital flora. the selected isolates inhibited also the growth of n. meningitidis and n. catarrhalis meaning that they produce antineisserial rather than antigonococcal activities. the crude preparations isolated from cultures of  micrococcus sp. no. 2 and 42, and acinetobacter sp. no. 13 on solid medium showed similar antigonococcal and antibacterial spectra as those observed with the basal spot/lawn method. these inhibitory activities were characterized for stability to extreme of temperature and ph values, and for susceptibility to different enzyme  treatments. based on ultrafiltration, differences in molecular size were observed between the inhibitors. these substances appear different from the previously reported gonococcal inhibitors of bacterial origin.

TI  == interference of neisseria gonorrhoeae growth by aerobic bacterial representatives of the urogenital flora.
AB  == aerobic bacterial isolates obtained from endocervical, vaginal and urethral swabbings were tested for interference of neisseria gonorrhoeae growth on solid medium. simultaneous antagonism was studied using the lawn spotting method, and delayed antagonism by the basal spot/lawn method. from 58 swabbings we recuperated a total of 181 isolates, 71 of those were found interfering with at least one out of four gonococcal strains (g-1, g-2, g-3 and g-4). similar percentages of interfering isolates were obtained from each of the isolation sites. the identification of the interfering isolates has revealed that similar numbers of coagulase negative staphylococci and identical numbers of group d streptococci were found for each of those sites. the majority of the interfering  isolates and also of the inhibitory coagulase negative staphylococci showed only  simultaneous antagonism. to complete the interference spectrum, we have tested all the active urogenital isolates against four other gonococcal strains (g-7, g-9, g-10 and g-11). this spectrum showed clearly that interference is not an all or none phenomenon. while the gonococcal interference spectrum of most of the gram positive cocci and the acinetobacter sp. strains is broad, that of all the other isolates is relatively narrow. gonococcal strains g-7 and g-9 were the most susceptible to inhibition by the interfering urogenital isolates while strain g-3 was the most resistant one.
