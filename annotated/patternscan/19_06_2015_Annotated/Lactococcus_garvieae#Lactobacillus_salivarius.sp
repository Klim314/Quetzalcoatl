TI  == assessment of the susceptibility of lactic acid bacteria to biocides.
AB  == biocides are antimicrobial compounds that are widely used in the food industry and medical environments. in this study, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) by the microdilution method of four different biocides for  a large collection of lab of different origins. the tested isolates belong to 11  species of the lactobacillus genus and to streptococcus thermophilus, streptococcus salivarius and lactococcus garvieae. the results obtained in this study indicate that low susceptibilities to benzalkonium chloride (bc), triclosan (tr), chlorhexidine (ch), and sodium hypochlorite (sh) are not frequent among lab. moreover, no systematic co-tolerance between two or more tested biocides was found; that is, strains displaying high mic values and thus low sensitivity to one of the biocides did not show higher mic values for the other biocides.

TI  == isolation and molecular characterization of antibiotic-resistant lactic acid bacteria from poultry and swine meat products.
AB  == the transfer via the food chain from animals to humans of microbes that are resistant to antimicrobial agents is of increasing concern. to determine the contributions of nonpathogenic microflora to the occurrence and spread of antibiotic resistance (ar) genes in the food chain, 123 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from 29 samples of raw and processed pork and chicken meat products that had previously tested positive for one or more ar genes that encode clinically relevant ars: tet(m), tet(o), tet(k), erm(a), erm(b), erm(c), aac (6')-ie aph (2")-ia, meca, and blaz. all of the isolates were initially tested for their ar gene profiles by pcr. the 59 isolates carrying a tet, erm, or blaz gene were taken through molecular identification, analyzed by determination of the mic, and subjected to genetic fingerprinting. lactococcus garvieae was the predominant species (28 isolates), followed by lactobacillus plantarum (11 isolates) and l. salivarius (6 isolates), whereas lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus  johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. crispatus, and l. brevis were identified at lower frequencies. the tet(m) and erm(b) genes were the most frequently detected. assessment of multiple resistances in 18 tet positive (tet+) isolates revealed that tet(m) plus erm(b) and tet(k) plus erm(b) were the most frequent ar gene patterns. partial sequencing of the tet(m) open reading frame of three selected strains showed high sequence similarities (> 99%) with tet(m) genes previously found in human pathogens (listeria monocytogenes and neisseria meningitidis). southern hybridization with plasmid profiles revealed these strains contained tet(m)-carrying plasmids.
