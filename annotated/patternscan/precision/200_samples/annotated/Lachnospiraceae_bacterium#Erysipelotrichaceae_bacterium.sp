TI == newly cultured bacteria with broad diversity isolated from eight-week continuous  culture enrichments of cow feces on complex polysaccharides.
AB == one of the functions of the mammalian large intestinal microbiota is the fermentation of plant cell wall components. in ruminant animals, the majority of their nutrients are obtained via pregastric fermentation; however, up to 20% can be recovered from microbial fermentation in the large intestine. eight-week continuous culture enrichments of cattle feces with cellulose and xylan-pectin were used to isolate bacteria from this community. a total of 459 bacterial isolates were classified phylogenetically using 16s rrna gene sequencing. six phyla were represented: firmicutes (51.9%), bacteroidetes (30.9%), proteobacteria (11.1%), actinobacteria (3.5%), synergistetes (1.5%), and fusobacteria (1.1%). the majority of bacterial isolates had <98.5% identity to cultured bacteria with sequences in the ribosomal database project and thus represent new species and/or genera. within the firmicutes isolates, most were classified in the families lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae, erysipelotrichaceae, and clostridiaceae i. the majority of the bacteroidetes were most closely related to bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. ovatus, and b. xylanisolvens and members of the porphyromonadaceae family. many of the firmicutes and bacteroidetes isolates were related to species demonstrated to possess enzymes which ferment plant cell wall components; the others were hypothesized to cross-feed these bacteria. the microbial communities that arose in these enrichment cultures had broad bacterial diversity. with over 98% of the isolates not represented as previously cultured, there are new opportunities to study the genomic and metabolic capacities of these members of the complex intestinal microbiota.

TI == infection with the carcinogenic liver fluke opisthorchis viverrini modifies intestinal and biliary microbiome.
AB == opisthorchis viverrini is a fish-borne trematode endemic in east asia. following  ingestion, the flukes locate to the biliary tre where chronic infection frequently leads to cholangiocarcinoma (cca). the mechanisms by which o. viverrini infection culminates in cca remain unknown. an unexplored aspect is its influence on the host microbiome. in the hamster, infection with this pathogen reliably leads to cca. genomic dnas of microbiota from colorectal contents and bile of hamsters and from whole o. viverrini were examined in this model of fluke-induced cca. microbial communities were characterized by high-throughput sequencing of variable regions 7-9 of prokaryotic 16s ribosomal dna. of approximately 1 million sequences, 536,009 with useable reads were assignable to 29,776 operational taxonomy units (otus) and, in turn, to 20 phyla and 273 genera of bacteria or archaea. microbial community analyses revealed that fluke infection perturbed the gastrointestinal tract microbiome, increasing lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae, and lactobacillaceae, while decreasing porphyromonadaceae, erysipelotrichaceae, and eubacteriaceae (p</=0.05). more than 60 otus were detected in the biliary system, which confirmed bacteriobilia and a noteworthy community of microbes associated with the parasites. the fluke-associated microorganisms included potential pathogens from the enterobacteriaceae and listeriaceae and others, including cyanobacteria and deinococci, usually found in external environments. given that opisthorchiasis is distinguished from other helminth infections by a robust inflammatory phenotype with conspicuously elevated il-6, and that inflammation of the biliary system leads to periductal fibrosis, which is a precursor of cca, the flukes and their microbiota may together drive this distinctive immune response.

TI == culturomics identified 11 new bacterial species from a single anorexia nervosa stool sample.
AB == the rebirth of bacterial culture has been highlighted successively by environmental microbiologists, the design of axenic culture for intracellular bacteria in clinical microbiology, and, more recently, by human gut microbiota studies. indeed, microbial culturomics (large scale of culture conditions with the identification of colonies by maldi-tof or 16s rrna) allowed to culture 32 new bacterial species from only four stool samples studied. we performed culturomics in comparison with pyrosequencing 16s rrna targeting the v6 region on an anorexia nervosa stool sample because this clinical condition has never been explored before by culture, while its composition has been observed to be atypical by metagenomics. we tested 88 culture conditions generating 12,700 different colonies identifying 133 bacterial species, with 19 bacterial species never isolated from the human gut before, including 11 new bacterial species for which the genome has been sequenced. these 11 new bacterial species isolated from a single stool sample allow to extend more significantly the repertoire in comparison to the bacterial species validated by the rest of the world during the last 2 years. pyrosequencing indicated a dramatic discrepancy with the culturomics results, with only 23 otus assigned to the species level overlapping (17 % of the culturomics results). most of the sequences assigned to bacteria detected only by pyrosequencing belonged to ruminococcaceae, lachnospiraceae, and erysipelotrichaceae constituted by strictly anaerobic species, indicating the future route for culturomics. this study revealed new bacterial species participating significantly to the extension of the gut microbiota repertoire, which is the first step before being able to connect the bacterial composition with the geographic or clinical status.

TI == the nonfermentable dietary fiber hydroxypropyl methylcellulose modulates intestinal microbiota.
AB == diet influences host metabolism and intestinal microbiota; however, detailed understanding of this tripartite interaction is limited. to determine whether the nonfermentable fiber hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (hpmc) could alter the intestinal microbiota and whether such changes correlated with metabolic improvements, c57b/l6 mice were normalized to a high-fat diet (hfd), then either maintained on hfd (control), or switched to hfd supplemented with 10% hpmc, or a low-fat diet (lfd). compared to control treatment, both lfd and hpmc reduced weight gain (11.8 and 5.7 g, respectively), plasma cholesterol (23.1 and 19.6%), and liver triglycerides (73.1 and 44.6%), and, as revealed by 454-pyrosequencing of the microbial 16s rrna gene, decreased microbial alpha-diversity and differentially altered intestinal microbiota. both lfd and hpmc increased intestinal erysipelotrichaceae (7.3- and 12.4-fold) and decreased lachnospiraceae (2.0- and 2.7-fold), while only hpmc increased peptostreptococcaceae (3.4-fold) and decreased ruminococcaceae (2.7-fold). specific microorganisms were directly linked with weight change and metabolic parameters in hpmc and hfd mice, but not in lfd mice, indicating that the intestinal microbiota may play differing roles during the two dietary modulations. this work indicates that hpmc is a potential prebiotic fiber that influences intestinal microbiota and improves host metabolism.
