TI  == intestinal microbiota and allergic diseases: a systematic review.
AB  == evidence suggests that possible imbalances in intestinal microbiota composition may be implicated in the occurrence of allergic diseases. although several studies published until 2006 indicated a correlation between microbiota composition and allergic symptoms, it has not been possible to distinguish protective microorganisms from those associated with increased risk of allergic diseases. therefore, the objective of this study was to review the studies published since 2007 that address the intestinal microbiota in allergic diseases. twenty-one studies were identified after excluding those that performed a clinical intervention before stool collection. in the early microbiota of children who later developed allergies, lower bacterial diversity was observed, with a predominance of firmicutes; a higher count of bacteroidaceae; a higher prevalence of the anaerobic bacteria bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum, and  bifidobacterium longum; and a lower prevalence of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, and lactobacillus. in the microbiota of allergic children whose intestinal microbiota was assessed at the onset of allergic symptoms, there was a higher count of bacteroides; a lower count of akkermansia muciniphila, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and clostridium; a higher prevalence of b. adolescentis; a lower prevalence of b. catenulatum and staphylococcus aureus; and a lower bacterial diversity.

TI  == double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled intervention trial to evaluate the effects of bifidobacterium longum cect 7347 in children with newly diagnosed coeliac disease.
AB  == interactions between the immune system and the intestinal microbiota may play a role in coeliac disease (cd). in the present study, the potential effects of bifidobacterium longum cect 7347 in children with newly diagnosed cd were evaluated. a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in  thirty-three children who received a capsule containing either b. longum cect 7347 (10(9) colony-forming units) or placebo (excipients) daily for 3 months together with a gluten-free diet (gfd). outcome measures (baseline and post-intervention) included immune phenotype of peripheral blood cells, serum cytokine concentration, faecal secretory iga (siga) content, anthropometric parameters and intestinal microbiota composition. comparisons between the groups  revealed greater height percentile increases (p= 0.048) in the b. longum cect 7347 group than in the placebo group, as well as decreased peripheral cd3(+) t lymphocytes (p= 0.004) and slightly reduced tnf-alpha concentration (p= 0.067). within-group comparisons of baseline and final values did not reveal any differences in t lymphocytes and cytokines in the placebo group, while decreased  cd3(+) (p =0.013) and human leucocyte antigen (hla)-dr(+) t lymphocytes (p =0.029) and slightly reduced tnf-alpha concentration (p= 0.085) were detected in  the b. longum cect 7347 group. comparison between the groups showed that the administration of b. longum cect 7347 reduced the numbers of the bacteroides fragilis group (p= 0.020) and the content of siga in stools (p= 0.011) compared with the administration of placebo. although this is a first exploratory intervention with limitations, the findings suggest that b. longum cect 7347 could help improve the health status of cd patients who tend to show alterations  in gut microbiota composition and a biased immune response even on a gfd.

TI  == interactions between bifidobacterium and bacteroides species in cofermentations are affected by carbon sources, including exopolysaccharides produced by bifidobacteria.
AB  == cocultures of strains from two bifidobacterium and two bacteroides species were performed with exopolysaccharides (eps) previously purified from bifidobacteria,  with inulin, or with glucose as the carbon source. bifidobacterium longum nb667 and bifidobacterium breve ipla20004 grew in glucose but showed poor or no growth  in complex carbohydrates (inulin, eps e44, and eps r1), whereas bacteroides grew  well in the four carbon sources tested. in the presence of glucose, the growth of bacteroides thetaiotaomicron dsm-2079 was inhibited by b. breve, whereas it remained unaffected in the presence of b. longum. ba. fragilis dsm-2151 contributed to a greater survival of b. longum, promoting changes in the synthesis of short-chain fatty acids (scfa) and organic acids in coculture with respect to monocultures. in complex carbohydrates, cocultures of bifidobacterium  strains with ba. thetaiotaomicron did not modify the behavior of bacteroides nor  improve the poor growth of bifidobacteria. the metabolic activity of ba. fragilis in coculture with bifidobacteria was not affected by eps, but greater survival of bifidobacteria at late stages of incubation occurred in cocultures than in monocultures, leading to a higher production of acetic acid than in monocultures. therefore, cocultures of bifidobacterium and bacteroides can behave differently against fermentable carbohydrates as a function of the specific characteristics of the strains from each species. these results stress the importance of considering specific species and strain interactions and not simply higher taxonomic divisions in the relationship among intestinal microbial populations and their different responses to probiotics and prebiotics.

TI  == influence of early environmental factors on lymphocyte subsets and gut microbiota in infants at risk of celiac disease; the proficel study.
AB  == introduction: it is known that the hla genotype can explain about a 40% of the genetic risk of celiac disease (cd), thus, other genetic predisposing factors as  well as factors that subtly modulate t cell activation and differentiation need to be studied. this includes environmental factors that are currently believed to impact on the immune system and gut microbiota development. aim: to assess the associations between early environmental factors (eef), lymphocyte subsets, and intestinal microbiota composition in infants at familial risk for cd. study design: prospective observational study. subjects: fifty-five 4 month-old infants with at least a first-degree relative suffering cd. infants were classified according to type of delivery, mother's antibiotic intake during pregnancy and during labor, milk-feeding practices, early infections and antibiotic intake, rotavirus vaccine administration, and allergy incidence within the first 18 months of life. methods: lymphocyte subsets and gut microbiota composition were studied at the age of 4 months. results: formula feeding and infant's infections  were associated with higher cd3+, cd4+, cd4+cd38+, cd4+cd28+ and cd3+cd4+cd45ro+  counts (p0.01). infant s infections were also associated with higher cd4+cd25+, cd4+hla-dr+ and nk cell counts (p0.01). cesarean delivery and rotavirus vaccine administration were associated with lower percentage of cd4+cd25+ cells. infant's antibiotic intake was associated and correlated with lower counts of bifidobacterium longum and higher counts of bacteroides fragilis group. conclusions: infant s infections and antibiotic intake in the first 4 months of life are the eef more strongly and/or frequently associated to lymphocyte subpopulations and microbiota composition, respectively, in infants at risk of cd.

TI  == ethnic diversity of gut microbiota: species characterization of bacteroides fragilis group and genus bifidobacterium in healthy belgian adults, and comparison with data from japanese subjects.
AB  == the composition of the human gut microbiota is related to host health, and it is  thought that dietary habits may play a role in shaping this composition. here, we examined the population size and prevalence of six predominant bacterial genera and the species compositions of genus bifidobacterium (g-bifid) and bacteroides fragilis group (g-bfra) in 42 healthy belgian adults by quantitative pcr (qpcr) over a period of one month. the population sizes and prevalence of these bacteria were basically stable throughout the study period. the predominant g-bifid species were bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium longum ss. longum,  and the predominant g-bfra species were bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides uniformis, and bacteroides ovatus. the belgian gut microbiota data were then compared with gut microbiota data from 46 japanese subjects collected according to the same protocol (matsuki et al., appl. environ. microbiol. 70, 167-173, 2004). the population size and prevalence of bifidobacterium catenulatum group were significantly lower in the belgian gut microbiota than in the japanese gut microbiota (p < 0.001); however, the population size and prevalence of g-bifid did not differ. this species-level qpcr analysis will be helpful for investigating the diversity of gut microbiota among ethnic groups.

TI  == treatment of bran containing bread by baking enzymes; effect on the growth of probiotic bacteria on soluble dietary fiber extract in vitro.
AB  == different ways of treating bran by baking enzymes prior to dough making and the baking process were used to increase the amount of water-soluble dietary fiber (df) in wheat bread with added bran. soluble df was extracted from the bread with water and separated from the digestible material with gastrointestinal tract enzymes and by solvent precipitation. the baking enzyme mixtures tested (xylanase and glucanase/cellulase, with and without lipase) increased the amounts of soluble arabinoxylan and protein resistant to digestion. the isolated fiber was used as a growth substrate for 11 probiotic and intestinal bifidobacterium strains, for commensal strains of bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli, and  for potential intestinal pathogenic strains of e. coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, and clostridium perfringens. fermentation analyses indicated that the tested strains had varying capacity to grow in the presence of the extracted  fiber. of the tested probiotic strains b. longum species generally showed the highest ability to utilize the fiber extracts, although the potential pathogens tested also showed an ability to grow on these fiber extracts. in sum, the enzymes used to improve the baking process for high-fiber bread can also be used  to produce in situ soluble fiber material, which in turn can exert prebiotic effects on certain potentially beneficial microbes.

TI  == molecular monitoring of the development of intestinal microbiota in japanese infants.
AB  == the faecal microbiota of 166 healthy japanese newborns was analysed periodically  from day 1 after birth until the age of 3 years by using the reverse transcription-quantitative pcr. faecal ph and the organic acid concentration were also examined. colonisation by both facultative anaerobes and strict anaerobes was confirmed in 95% of the meconium tested. bifidobacterium-predominant microbiota was established subsequently in most of the infants by 3 months after  birth. bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium catenulatum group and bifidobacterium bifidum were the species mainly detected. intergroup correlation analysis revealed that the bifidobacterial population levels, but not other strict anaerobe groups, were found to be negatively correlated with those of the enterobacteriaceae from 7 days until 3 months after birth. faecal ph was maintained at about 6 until 6 months after birth and reached 6.6 at 3 years after birth. the initial concentration of faecal organic acids (19 mum/g of faeces) just after birth increased until 3 years after birth to the level of 111 mum/g of faeces. early start of feeding formula milk promoted colonisation by obligate anaerobes such as the clostridium coccoides group, the clostridium leptum subgroup, prevotella, and atopobium cluster during the 3 months after birth. population levels of the bifidobacteria until 1 month after birth and those of the bacteroides fragilis group until 6 months after birth were lower in infants delivered by caesarean section than in those delivered normally. the results suggested that both earlier start of feeding of formula milk and the mode of infant delivery were found to be important in the development of intestinal microbiota in early infancy.

TI  == role of metabolism by human intestinal microflora in geniposide-induced toxicity  in hepg2 cells.
AB  == possible role of metabolism by the intestinal bacteria in geniposide-induced cytotoxicity was investigated in human hepatoma hepg2 cells. initially, toxic effects of geniposide and its metabolite genipin were compared. genipin, a deglycosylated form of geniposide, was cytotoxic at the concentrations that geniposide was not. as metabolic activation systems for geniposide, human intestinal bacterial cultures, fecal preparation (fecalase) and intestinal microbial enzyme mix were employed in the present study. when geniposide was incubated with human intestinal bacteria, either bifidobacterium longum hy8001 or bacteroides fragilis, for 24 h, the cultured media caused cytotoxicity in hepg2 cells. fecalase and intestinal enzyme mix were also effective to metabolically activate geniposide to its cytotoxic metabolite. the present results indicated that genipin, a metabolite of geniposide, might be more toxic than geniposide, and that intestinal bacteria might have a role in biotransformation of geniposide to its toxic metabolite. in addition, among three activation systems tested, intestinal microbial enzyme mix would be convenient to use in detecting toxicants requiring metabolic activation by intestinal bacteria.

TI  == influence of milk-feeding type and genetic risk of developing coeliac disease on  intestinal microbiota of infants: the proficel study.
AB  == interactions between environmental factors and predisposing genes could be involved in the development of coeliac disease (cd). this study has assessed whether milk-feeding type and hla-genotype influence the intestinal microbiota composition of infants with a family history of cd. the study included 164 healthy newborns, with at least one first-degree relative with cd, classified according to their hla-dq genotype by pcr-ssp dqb1 and dqa1 typing. faecal microbiota was analysed by quantitative pcr at 7 days, and at 1 and 4 months of age. significant interactions between milk-feeding type and hla-dq genotype on bacterial numbers were not detected by applying a linear mixed-model analysis for repeated measures. in the whole population, breast-feeding promoted colonization  of c. leptum group, b. longum and b. breve, while formula-feeding promoted that of bacteroides fragilis group, c. coccoides-e. rectale group, e. coli and b. lactis. moreover, increased numbers of b. fragilis group and staphylococcus spp., and reduced numbers of bifidobacterium spp. and b. longum were detected in infants with increased genetic risk of developing cd. analyses within subgroups of either breast-fed or formula-fed infants indicated that in both cases increased risk of cd was associated with lower numbers of b. longum and/or bifidobacterium spp. in addition, in breast-fed infants the increased genetic risk of developing cd was associated with increased c. leptum group numbers, while in formula-fed infants it was associated with increased staphylococcus and  b. fragilis group numbers. overall, milk-feeding type in conjunction with hla-dq  genotype play a role in establishing infants' gut microbiota; moreover, breast-feeding reduced the genotype-related differences in microbiota composition, which could partly explain the protective role attributed to breast  milk in this disorder.

TI  == effect of the oral intake of yogurt containing bifidobacterium longum bb536 on the cell numbers of enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis in microbiota.
AB  == enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis (etbf) strains have been suggested to be associated with acute and persistent diarrheal disease, inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer, although further epidemiological studies are needed for clarification. here, a pilot study was performed to examine the effect of the oral administration of yogurt supplemented with a probiotic strain on the  cell numbers of fecal etbf in a healthy population. among 420 healthy adults, 38  subjects were found to be etbf carriers, giving a prevalence of approximately 9%. among them, 32 subjects were enrolled in an open, randomized, parallel-group study to ingest yogurt supplemented with a probiotic strain, bifidobacterium longum bb536 (bb536y group), for 8 weeks, with milk provided to the control group (milk group). the cell numbers of etbf and the dominant species of the b. fragilis group were measured by a quantitative pcr method. compared with the baseline values, there was a significant decrease in the cell number of etbf at week 8 in the bb536y group but not in the milk group. linear mixed models analysis for longitudinal data revealed a significant difference in the changes of etbf cell number between the two groups during the intervention phase. these results imply the potential of probiotic yogurt for eliminating etbf in the microbiota, but its clinical significance needs to be evaluated in the future. this is the first report of a possible effect of probiotic intake on etbf in the  microbiota.

TI  == temporal variations in early gut microbial colonization are associated with allergen-specific immunoglobulin e but not atopic eczema at 2 years of age.
AB  == background: intestinal microbiota undergoes substantial development during the first 2 years of life, important for intestinal immunologic development and maturation influencing systemic immune responses. objective: we aimed to investigate, using a prospective study design, whether allergen-specific ige (sige) and atopic eczema are associated with variations in gut microbial colonization patterns in an unselected population during the first 2 years of life. methods: faeces from 94 infants were repeatedly sampled from 10 days, 4 months, 1 and 2 years postnatal and analysed for 12 different bacterial species by quantitative real-time pcr. venous blood samples from the infants were collected at 2 years of age and were analysed for sige for 12 specific allergens. the temporal gut colonization patterns for 42 sige-positive (sige>/=0.35 ku/l) and 52 sige-negative children (sige<0.1 ku/l) were then compared. the association between colonization pattern and phenotype as atopic eczema according to uk working party (ukwp) criteria were also described. results: subjects with atopic  sensitization had lower levels of escherichia coli at 4 months and 1 year, higher levels of bifidobacterium longum at 1 year and lower levels of bacteroides fragilis at 2 years. for e. coli and b. longum, the differences were only transient and had disappeared by 2 years of age. for other species, there were no differences in colonization patterns, and we found no association between colonization pattern and atopic eczema. conclusions and clinical relevance: we found temporal and transient variations in gut microbial colonization patterns associated with differences in sige sensitization at 2 years of age. a full understanding of the principles and mechanisms that underlie intestinal microbial colonization and diversity and host-microbiota relationships will be pivotal for  the development of therapeutic approaches that manipulate the intestinal microbiota to maintain human health.

TI  == dietary glycosaminoglycans interfere in bacterial adhesion and gliadin-induced pro-inflammatory response in intestinal epithelial (caco-2) cells.
AB  == dietary components may have an important role in maintaining a balanced gut microbiota composition. celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy caused by gliadins, and has been associated with a reduced proportion of bifidobacterium in gut microbiota. this study evaluates the influence of glycosaminoglycans (gags) on bacterial adhesion and their contribution in the gliadins-induced inflammatory response. the adhesion of potential probiotic (bifidobacterium longum cect 7347 and bifidobacterium bifidum cect 7365), commensal (escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis) and pathogenic (salmonella enterica cect 443 and listeria monocytogenes cect 935) bacteria to mucin and caco-2 cell cultures was determined. gliadins were subjected to in vitro digestion (pepsin/pancreatin-bile), with/out gags, and the presence or not of cell suspensions of b. longum (10(8) cfu/ml). b. longum, e. coli, and l. monocytogenes, markedly interact with the high-sulphur-containing fraction of gags. the gags reduced the gliadins-mediated production of interleukin-1beta, but not tumour necrosis factor-alpha. the results suggest that gags may ameliorate gliadin-induced inflammatory response, though they also slightly interfere with the action of b. longum.

TI  == consumption of human milk oligosaccharides by gut-related microbes.
AB  == human milk contains large amounts of complex oligosaccharides that putatively modulate the intestinal microbiota of breast-fed infants by acting as decoy binding sites for pathogens and as prebiotics for enrichment of beneficial bacteria. several bifidobacterial species have been shown to grow well on human milk oligosaccharides. however, few data exist on other bacterial species. this work examined 16 bacterial strains belonging to 10 different genera for growth on human milk oligosaccharides. for this propose, a chemically defined medium, zmb1, was used, which allows vigorous growth of a number of gut-related microorganisms  in a fashion similar to complex media. interestingly, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, bacteroides fragilis , and bacteroides vulgatus strains were able to metabolize milk oligosaccharides with high efficiency, whereas enterococcus , streptococcus , veillonella , eubacterium , clostridium , and escherichia coli strains grew less well or not at all. mass spectrometry-based glycoprofiling of the oligosaccharide consumption behavior revealed a specific preference for fucosylated oligosaccharides by bi. longum subsp. infantis and ba. vulgatus. this work expands the current knowledge of human milk oligosaccharide consumption by gut microbes, revealing bacteroides as avid consumers of this substrate. these results provide insight on how human milk oligosaccharides shape the infant intestinal microbiota.

TI  == pivotal advance: bifidobacteria and gram-negative bacteria differentially influence immune responses in the proinflammatory milieu of celiac disease.
AB  == cd is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the small intestine that presents in genetically predisposed individuals following gluten consumption. in this study,  the effects of bifidobacterium (bifidobacterium bifidum iata-es2 and bifidobacterium longum atcc15707) and gram-negative bacteria (bacteroides fragilis dsm2451, escherichia coli cbl2, and shigella cbd8 isolated from cd patients), alone and in the presence of cd triggers (gliadins and/or ifn-gamma) on surface marker expression and cytokine production by pbmcs, were determined. these effects were also evaluated in cocultures of pbmcs and caco-2 cells. the gram-negative bacteria induced higher secretion of th1-type proinflammatory cytokines (il-12 and/or ifn-gamma) than the bifidobacterium strains. shigella cbd8 and e. coli cbl2 up-regulated mainly hla-dr and cd40 expression involved in  th1 activation, and bifidobacterium strains up-regulated cd83 expression. specific interactions among the studied bacteria, gliadins, and ifn-gamma, which  favored the cd immune features, were also detected. therefore, intestinal bacteria could be additional factors that regulate the ability of monocytes recruited to the mucosa to respond to gliadins and ifn-gamma in cd patients, influencing the course of the disease.

TI  == interplay between weight loss and gut microbiota composition in overweight adolescents.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the influence of an obesity treatment program on the gut microbiota and body weight of overweight adolescents. thirty-six adolescents (13-15 years), classified as overweight according to the international obesity task force bmi criteria, were submitted to a calorie-restricted diet (10-40%) and increased physical activity (15-23 kcal/kg body weight/week) program over 10 weeks. gut bacterial groups were analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr before and after the intervention. a group of subjects (n=23) experienced >4.0 kg weight loss and showed significant bmi (p=0.030) and bmi z-score (p=0.035) reductions after the intervention, while the other group (n=13) showed <2.0 kg weight loss. no significant differences in dietary intake were found between both groups. in the whole adolescent population, the intervention led to increased bacteroides fragilis group (p=0.001) and lactobacillus group (p=0.030) counts, and to decreased clostridium coccoides group (p=0.028), bifidobacterium longum (p=0.031), and bifidobacterium adolescentis (p=0.044) counts. in the high weight-loss group, b. fragilis group and lactobacillus group counts also increased (p=0.001 and p=0.007, respectively), whereas c. coccoides group and b. longum counts decreased (p=0.001 and p=0.044, respectively) after the intervention. total bacteria, b. fragilis group and clostridium leptum group, and bifidobacterium catenulatum group counts  were significantly higher (p<0.001-0.036) while levels of c. coccoides group, lactobacillus group, bifidobacterium, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium  bifidum were significantly lower (p<0.001-0.008) in the high weight-loss group than in the low weight-loss group before and after the intervention. these findings indicate that calorie restriction and physical activity have an impact on gut microbiota composition related to body weight loss, which also seem to be  influenced by the individual's microbiota.

TI  == distribution of secretory inhibitor of platelet microbicidal protein among anaerobic bacteria isolated from stool of children with diarrhea.
AB  == aim: to study the secretory inhibitor of platelet microbicidal protein (sipmp) phenotypes of faecal anaerobic isolates from patients with diarrhea. methods: faecal isolates of anaerobic bacteria (b. fragilis, n = 42; b. longum, n = 70; a. israelii, n = 21; e. lentum, n = 12) from children with diarrhea were tested. sipmp production was tested by inhibition of platelet microbicidal protein (pmp)  bioactivity against b. subtilis and was expressed as percentage of inhibition of  pmp bactericidal activity. results: among anaerobic isolates 80% of b. longum strains, 85.7% of a. israelii strains, 50% of e. lentum strains and 92.86% of b.  fragilis strains were sipmp-positive. the isolated anaerobic organisms demonstrated sipmp production at a mean level of 13.8% +/- 0.7%, 14.7% +/- 1.8%,  3.9% +/- 0.9% (p < 0.05) and 26.8% +/- 7.5% (p < 0.05) for bifidobacteria, a. israelii, e. lentum and b. fragilis, respectively. conclusion: data from the present study may have significant implications in understanding the pathogenesis of microecological disorders in the intestine, as well as for future improvement  in the prevention and therapy of anaerobe-associated infections.

TI  == molecular studies of fecal anaerobic commensal bacteria in acute diarrhea in children.
AB  == background and objective: the commensal bacterial flora of the colon may undergo  changes during diarrhea, owing to colonization of the intestine by pathogens and  to rapid intestinal transit. this study used molecular methods to determine changes in the composition of selected commensal anaerobic bacteria during and after acute diarrhea in children. materials and methods: fecal samples were obtained from 46 children with acute diarrhea in a rural community during an episode of acute diarrhea, immediately after recovery from diarrhea, and 3 months after recovery. dna was extracted and quantitative polymerase chain reaction using sybr green and genus- and species-specific primers targeting 16s rdna were  undertaken to quantitate the following groups of bacteria: bifidobacterium spp.,  bifidobacterium longum group, bacteroides-prevotella group, bacteroides fragilis, lactobacillus acidophilus group, faecalibacterium prauznitzii, and eubacterium rectale, relative to amplification of universal bacterial domain 16s rdna. results: bacteria belonging to the bacteroides-prevotella-porphyromonas group, e  rectale, l acidophilus, and f prauznitzii groups were low during acute diarrhea compared with their levels after recovery from diarrhea. the pattern was similar  in rotavirus diarrhea and nonrotavirus diarrhea. administration of amylase-resistant maize starch as adjuvant therapy was associated with lower levels of f prauznitzii at the time of recovery but did not lead to other changes in the floral pattern. conclusions: specific classes of fecal bacteria are lower  during episodes of acute diarrhea in children than during periods of normal gastrointestinal health, suggesting specific alterations in the flora during diarrhea.

TI  == influence of bifidobacterium longum bb536 intake on faecal microbiota in individuals with japanese cedar pollinosis during the pollen season.
AB  == it has been reported that intake of yogurt or powder supplemented with the bifidobacterium longum bb536 probiotic strain alleviated subjective symptoms and  affected blood markers of allergy in individuals with japanese cedar pollinosis (jcpsis) during the pollen seasons of 2004 and 2005, based on randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. furthermore, the 2004 study found that intestinal bacteria such as the bacteroides fragilis group significantly fluctuated during the pollen season in jcpsis individuals and intake of bb536 yogurt tended to suppress these fluctuations. the present study investigated faecal microbiota to examine whether any changes occurred during the pollen season and whether any influence was exerted by intake of bb536 powder in the 2005 pollen season, which happened to be a heavy season, to confirm the 2004 findings and to evaluate the relationship of microbiota with symptom development. in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 44 jcpsis subjects received bb536 or a placebo for 13 weeks during the pollen season. another 14 japanese cedar pollen (jcp)-specific ige negative healthy subjects received placebo for the same period. faecal samples were collected before (week 0), during (weeks 4, 8 and 13) and after (week 17) intervention, and out of jcp season (week 28). faecal microbiota were analysed using terminal-rflp (t-rflp) and real-time pcr methods. principal component analysis based on t-rflp indicated distinct patterns of microbiota between healthy subjects and jcpsis subjects in the placebo group, but an intermediate pattern in the bb536 group at week 13, the last stage of the pollen season. the coordinate of principal component 1 at week  13 correlated with composite scores of jcpsis symptoms recorded during the pollen season. faecalibacterium prausnitzii and the bacteroides fragilis group were identified as the main contributors to microbiotal fluctuations. real-time pcr indicated that bb536 intake suppressed increases in the bacteroides fragilis group compared with the placebo group (p <0.05). these results suggest that faecal microbiota in jcpsis subjects, but not healthy subjects, fluctuate at the  end of the pollen season and that bb536 intake plays a role in maintaining normal microbiota.

TI  == fluctuation of fecal microbiota in individuals with japanese cedar pollinosis during the pollen season and influence of probiotic intake.
AB  == background: we have previously reported the results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that found the intake of yogurt supplemented with a probiotic strain, bifidobacterium longum bb536, alleviates symptoms and affects blood parameters in individuals with japanese cedar pollinosis (jcpsis) during the pollen season. objective: in the present study, fecal microbiota were investigated to examine whether any changes occur during the pollen season and whether any influence is exerted by probiotic intake. methods: yogurt either with bb536 (bb536 yogurt) or without bb536 (placebo yogurt) was administered for 14 weeks at 2 x 100 g per day to 40 subjects (17 men, 23 women) with a clinical history of jcpsis. fecal samples were obtained from 23 subjects (placebo group, n=13; bb536 group, n=10) before and during the intervention (weeks 4, 9 and 13) and fecal microbiota were analyzed using terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism and real-time polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) methods. results: from the fluctuation patterns of terminal-restriction fragments, the bacteroides fragilis group and bifidobacteria were among the species that changed most with pollen dispersion. real-time pcr analyses indicated that the cell numbers of the b fragilis group increased significantly along with pollen dispersion in both bb536 and placebo groups. cell numbers of bifidobacteria were significantly higher in the bb536 group compared with the placebo group (p < .05 at weeks 4 and 9). the ratio of cell numbers of the b fragilis group to bifidobacteria increased significantly during the pollen  season in the placebo group (p < .01 at weeks 9 and 14), but not in the bb536 group. an in vitro study using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from jcpsis subjects indicated that strains of the b fragilis group induced significantly more helper t cell (t(h)) type2 cytokines (interleukin [il]-6) but fewer t(h)1 cytokines (il-12 and interferon) compared with those of bifidobacteria. conclusions: these results suggest a relationship between fluctuation in intestinal microbiota and pollinosis allergy. furthermore, intake of bb536 yogurt appears to exert positive ihfluences on the formation of anti-allergic microbiota.

AB  == the growth of pure cultures of bacteroides thetaiotaomicron lmg 11262 and bacteroides fragilis lmg 10263 on fructose and oligofructose was examined and compared to that of bifidobacterium longum bb536 through in vitro laboratory fermentations. gas chromatography (gc) analysis was used to determine the different fractions of oligofructose and their degradation during the fermentation process. both b. thetaiotaomicron lmg 11262 and b. fragilis lmg 10263 were able to grow on oligofructose as fast as on fructose, succinic acid being the major metabolite produced by both strains. b. longum bb536 grew slower  on oligofructose than on fructose. acetic acid and lactic acid were the main metabolites produced when fructose was used as the sole energy source. increased  amounts of formic acid and ethanol were produced when oligofructose was used as an energy source at the cost of lactic acid. detailed kinetic analysis revealed a preferential metabolism of the short oligofructose fractions (e.g., f2 and f3) for b. longum bb536. after depletion of the short fractions, the larger oligofructose fractions (e.g., f4, gf4, f5, gf5, and f6) were metabolized, too. both bacteroides strains did not display such a preferential metabolism and degraded all oligofructose fractions simultaneously, transiently increasing the fructose concentration in the medium. this suggests a different mechanism for oligofructose breakdown between the strain of bifidobacterium and both strains of bacteroides, which helps to explain the bifidogenic nature of inulin-type fructans.

TI  == development of a membrane-array method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == a membrane-array method was developed for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples without using the expensive microarray-arrayer and laser-scanner. the 16s rdna sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to nitrocellulose membranes. digoxigenin (dig)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or pure cultured bacteria using two universal primers, and were hybridized to the membrane-array. hybridization signals were read by nbt/bcip color development. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, b. fragilis, b. distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, c. leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, r. bromii, r. callidus, r. albus, bifidobacterium  longum, b. adolescentis, b. infantis, eubacterium biforme, e. aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus,escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the membrane-array method is a reliable technique for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples. the result was also confirmed by  using specific pcr methods for these bacteria.

TI  == design and evaluation of oligonucleotide-microarray method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == an oligonucleotide-microarray method was developed for the detection of intestinal bacteria in fecal samples collected from human subjects. the 16s rdna  sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to glass slides. cyanine5 (cy5)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or bacterial dna using two universal primers and were hybridized to the oligo-microarray. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, clostridium leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, ruminococcus bromii, ruminococcus callidus, ruminococcus albus, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium infantis, eubacterium biforme, eubacterium aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the oligo-microarray method developed in this study is a reliable method for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples.

TI  == growth-inhibiting effects of cinnamomum cassia bark-derived materials on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibiting activity of cinnamomum cassia (blume) bark-derived materials toward five intestinal bacteria was examined using an impregnated paper disk method and compared with that of tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as four commercially available compounds (cinnamyl alcohol, trans-cinnamic acid,  eugenol, and salicylaldehyde). the biologically active component of c. cassia bark was characterized as cinnamaldehyde by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with each bacterial strain tested. in a test using 1 and 0.5 mg/disks, cinnamaldehyde revealed potent inhibition against clostridium perfringensand bacteroides fragilis. at 1 and 0.5 mg/disk, growth of bifidobacterium bifidum was significantly inhibited, whereas weak or no inhibitory activity was obtained against bifidobacterium longum or lactobacillus  acidophilus. the inhibitory effect was much more pronounced in cl. perfringens, b. fragilis, and bi. bifidum, compared to bi. longum or l. acidophilus. salicylaldehyde exhibited moderate growth-inhibiting activity, but little or no inhibition was observed from treatments with cinnamyl alcohol, trans-cinnamic acid, and eugenol. in contrast, tetracycline and chloramphenicol significantly inhibited growth of all test bacteria as low as 0.01 mg/disk. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of c. cassia bark.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == bifidobacterium, bacteroides, and clostridium spp. in fecal samples from breast-fed and bottle-fed infants with and without iron supplement.
AB  == bifidobacterium, bacteroides, and clostridium spp. isolated from the feces of 23  neonates during the first 3 months of life were identified. of the 23 neonates, 10 were breast fed, 6 received an infant formula with iron supplement (5 mg/liter), and 7 received the formula without iron supplement (iron concentration, less than 0.5 mg/liter). the bifidobacterium spp. most frequently  isolated from the three groups of infants were b. longum, b. breve, b. adolescentis, and b. bifidum. the bacteroides spp. most frequently isolated were  b. fragilis and b. vulgatus. the most common clostridium sp. in the three groups  of infants was c. perfringens. the type of milk did not select for species of bifidobacterium, bacteroides, or clostridium, except for clostridium butyricum, which was isolated significantly more often from bottle-fed infants with iron supplement than from the other groups, and clostridium tertium, which was more often isolated from breast-fed infants. the species of the three anaerobic genera did not persist for a long period of time in the three groups of infants.
