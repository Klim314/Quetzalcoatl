TI  == the microbiota of acute apical abscesses.
AB  == as the breadth of bacterial diversity in the oral cavity has been deciphered by molecular studies, several newly identified species/phylotypes have emerged as potential pathogens. we hypothesized that many of these species/phylotypes could  also be involved with the etiology of endodontic abscesses. abscess aspirates from 42 persons were analyzed for the presence of 81 species/phylotypes by means  of a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. associations between the most frequently detected taxa were calculated. the most prevalent taxa were fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, and porphyromonas endodontalis. other  frequently found taxa included olsenella uli, streptococci, eikenella corrodens,  some as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes (bacteroidetes clone x083 and synergistes clone ba121), and newly named species (prevotella baroniae and dialister invisus). several positive bacterial associations were disclosed. findings not only strengthen the association of many cultivable species with abscesses, but also include some newly named species and uncultivated phylotypes in the set of candidate pathogens associated with this disease.
