TI  - In vitro evaluation of MTAD and nisin in combination against common pathogens associated with root canal infection.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Many pathogenic microorganisms were found in an infected root canal. The object of this study was to evaluate the effect of MTAD in combination with nisin on the pathogens associated with root canal infection. METHODS: The survival rates of 9 pathogenic bacteria were determined after 1-, 5-, and 10-minute treatment with MTAD, MTAN (substitution of doxycycline with nisin), and MTADN (nisin in combination with doxycycline). The survival rates of Enterococcus faecalis in the starvation phase and pretreatment alkalization as well as in the normal physiological state under MTAD, MTAN, and MTADN challenge for 1, 5, and 10 minutes were evaluated and compared. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the morphologic modification of Actinomyces naeslundii, Lactobacillus paracasei, and Porphyromonas gingivalis after MTAD and MTADN treatment. RESULTS: L. fermenti, L. paracasei, A. viscosus, A. naeslundii, Streptococcus gordonii, and Peptostreptococcus were more sensitive to MTADN and MTAN than to MTAD. MTAD, MTAN, and MTADN showed a rapid antibacterial effect on P. gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Enterococcus faecalis in the stress state was as sensitive to MTAD, MTAN, and MTADN as the control E. faecalis. Furthermore, in the observation of scanning electron microscopy, the membranes in A. naeslundii and L. paracasei presented significant rupture, and P. gingivalis did not exhibit significant damage after MTADN treatment. CONCLUSIONS: MTAD in combination with nisin improved antibacterial efficacy against pathogens, especially for some gram-positive bacteria associated with persistent intracanal infection. Therefore, the combination had the potential to be used as an effective intracanal irrigation.
TI  - Vaginal bacterial flora activates rat peritoneal mast cells.
AB  - Sixteen strains of physiological and pathological vaginal bacteria were tested for their ability to secrete histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells in vitro. We noticed that Mycoplasma hominis-induced histamine release was very high (up to 53.6%). The stimulation of rat mast cells with Staphylococccus cohnii, Staphylococcus coagulase(-) (two strains), Ureaplasma urealyticum, Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides capillosus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae resulted in lower but significant histamine secretion (11.2%-17.5%). Other bacteria strains (Staphylococcus epidermidids, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Actinomyces naeslundii (two strains) and Lactobacillus fermentum (two strains) caused very low (4.2% - 8.8%) histamine release.
TI  - [The influence of anaerobic bacteria and mycoplasma isolated from the genital tract on mast cell activation].
AB  - Nowadays, it is known that mast cells, numerously appearing in all organs and being a source of a wide range of mediators and cytokines, are involved both in physiological and pathological processes. The aim of our study was to examine whether vaginal bacteria, especially those participating in Bacterial vaginosis, are able to activate mast cells to mediators secretion. The study was done on rat peritoneal mast cells. The mast cells were incubated in vitro with suspensions of Bacteroides capillosus, Actinomyces naeslundii (2 strains), Peptostreptococcus spp., Lactobacillus fermentum (2 strains), Mycoplasma hominis or Ureaplasma urealyticum killed by temperature. Activation of mast cells was estimated on the basis of histamine release. It was established that M. hominis, U. urealyticum and B. capillosus strongly stimulated rat mast cells to histamine secretion (histamine release 53.0%, 17.4% and 10.0%, respectively). Histamine release induced by Peptostreptococcus spp., A. naeslundii and L. fermentum was lower (at a range of 2.4%-8.2%). The obtained results can suggest that presumably interactions between vaginal bacteria and placental mast cells could influence the course of pregnancy.
TI  - [Studies on the locality and the function of spirosome in bacterial cells: relationship between the production of spirosome and anaerobic glycolysis].
AB  - The locality and the function of spirosome were studied by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and electron microscopy in Peptostreptococcus productus, Clostridium sp. HD-17, Lactobacillus fermentum, Eubacterium aerofaciens and Escherichia cali B. When the bacterial cells in phosphate buffered saline were disrupted by sonication and fractionated by differential centrifugation, the spirosome protein was found in the cytoplasmic fraction and not in the fraction of cell wall and cell membrane (the envelope fraction). The spirosome protein was found, however, in the envelope fraction when the bacterial cells were treated with a proper concentration of SDS. The spirosome protein in the envelope fraction disappeared after treatment with 2% Triton X-100 for 2 h. These results suggest that the spirosome protein anchored to the cell membrane upon SDS treatment. So it is presumed that the locality of spirosome is close to the cell membrane. Spirosome production increased in parallel to the concentration of glucose in the medium in obligate and aerotolerant anaerobes as well as in facultative anaerobes. This result indicates that the spirosome production was induced during the process of anaerobic glycolysis. Fructose as the sole carbon source in the minimal medium induced the spirosome production by E. coli as did glucose, but sodium pyruvate did not induce it either under aerobic or anaerobic condition.
TI  - Urease-producing species of intestinal anaerobes and their activities.
AB  - Urease activities of anaerobic bacteria that constituted predominant gut flora were examined. It was demonstrated that some strains of Eubacterium aerofaciens, E. lentum, and Peptostreptococcus products produced urease. They were the most numerous species in human feces. All strains of Bifidobacterium infantis and some strains of Bacteroides multiacidus, B. bifidum, Clostridium symbiosum, Fusobacterium necrophorum, F. varium, Lactobacillus fermentum, Peptococcus asaccharolyticus, and P. prevotii produced urease. The optimum pH of the Lactobacillus urease was found to be 4.0, whereas the pH value of B. multiacidus urease was 8.0.
