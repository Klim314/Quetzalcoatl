TI  - The ongoing revolution of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry for microbiology reaches tropical Africa.
AB  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) represents a revolution in routine pathogen identification in clinical microbiology laboratories. A MALDI-TOF MS was introduced to tropical Africa in the clinical microbiology laboratory of the Hopital Principal de Dakar (Senegal) and used for routine pathogen identification. Using MS, 2,429 bacteria and fungi isolated from patients were directly assayed, leading to the identification of 2,082 bacteria (85.7%) and 206 fungi (8.5%) at the species level, 109 bacteria (4.5%) at the genus level, and 16 bacteria (0.75%) at the family level. Sixteen isolates remained unidentified (0.75%). Escherichia coli was the most prevalent species (25.8%) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.8%), Streptococcus agalactiae (6.2%), Acinetobacter baumannii (6.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.9%), and Staphylococcus aureus (5.9%). MALDI-TOF MS has also enabled the detection of rare bacteria and fungi. MALDI-TOF MS is a powerful tool for the identification of bacterial and fungal species involved in infectious diseases in tropical Africa.
TI  - Influence of sequence mismatches on the specificity of recombinase polymerase amplification technology.
AB  - Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) technology relies on three major proteins, recombinase proteins, single-strand binding proteins, and polymerases, to specifically amplify nucleic acid sequences in an isothermal format. The performance of RPA with respect to sequence mismatches of closely-related non-target molecules is not well documented and the influence of the number and distribution of mismatches in DNA sequences on RPA amplification reaction is not well understood. We investigated the specificity of RPA by testing closely-related species bearing naturally occurring mismatches for the tuf gene sequence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and/or Mycobacterium tuberculosis and for the cfb gene sequence of Streptococcus agalactiae. In addition, the impact of the number and distribution of mismatches on RPA efficiency was assessed by synthetically generating 14 types of mismatched forward primers for detecting five bacterial species of high diagnostic relevance such as Clostridium difficile, Staphylococcus aureus, S. agalactiae, P. aeruginosa, and M. tuberculosis as well as Bacillus atropheus subsp. globigii for which we use the spores as internal control in diagnostic assays. A total of 87 mismatched primers were tested in this study. We observed that target specific RPA primers with mismatches (n > 1) at their 3'extrimity hampered RPA reaction. In addition, 3 mismatches covering both extremities and the center of the primer sequence negatively affected RPA yield. We demonstrated that the specificity of RPA was multifactorial. Therefore its application in clinical settings must be selected and validated a priori. We recommend that the selection of a target gene must consider the presence of closely-related non-target genes. It is advisable to choose target regions with a high number of mismatches (>/=36%, relative to the size of amplicon) with respect to closely-related species and the best case scenario would be by choosing a unique target gene.
TI  - Nosocomial bloodstream infections in a Finnish tertiary care hospital: a retrospective cohort study of 2175 episodes during the years 1999-2001 and 2005-2010.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nosocomial infections are major causes of morbidity in hospitalized patients. METHODS: Retrospective laboratory-based surveillance during 1999-2001 and 2005-2010 identified 2175 cases of nosocomial bloodstream infections (BSIs) in Tampere University Hospital (TAUH), Finland. RESULTS: Analysis revealed that 57% of BSIs were caused by a gram-positive organism, 27% by a gram-negative organism, 5% by a fungal organism, and 11% were polymicrobial. The most common cause of nosocomial BSI was coagulase-negative staphylococci (23%). Candida species caused 5% of the infections. The 7-day and 30-day case fatalities were 8% (161/2158) and 15% (313/2175), respectively, and were highest in BSIs caused by Candida albicans (22% and 44%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17% and 25%). The median age of patients was 54 years in 1999-2001, 57 years in 2005-2007, and 60 years in 2008-2010 (p < 0.001). The median time from hospital admission to the onset of BSI was 11 days (quartiles 5-18 days). This period was shortest for Streptococcus agalactiae BSI and longest for Candida non-albicans fungemia (1 vs 19 days). The case fatality rate in nosocomial BSI decreased during the years studied: 7-day and 30-day case fatalities were 9% and 16% during 1999-2001, 8.5% and 16% during 2005-2007, and 5% and 12% during 2008-2010, respectively (p < 0.003 and p = 0.022, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Gram-positive infections predominate in nosocomial BSIs. The median age of patients with nosocomial BSI has risen during the study years. The case fatality associated with nosocomial BSI has decreased.
TI  - Development of a multiplex real-time PCR assay for the rapid diagnosis of neonatal late onset sepsis.
AB  - The diagnosis of late onset sepsis (LOS), a severe condition with high prevalence in preterm infants, is hampered by the suboptimal sensitivity and long turnaround time of blood culture. Detection of the infecting pathogen directly in blood by PCR would provide a much more timely result. Unfortunately, PCR-based assays reported so far are labor intensive and often lack direct species identification. Therefore we developed a real-time multiplex PCR assay tailored to LOS diagnosis which is easy-to-use, is applicable on small blood volumes and provides species-specific results within 4h. Species-specific PCR assays were selected from literature or developed using bioinformatic tools for the detection of the most prevalent etiologic pathogens: Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp. and Serratia marcescens. The PCR assays showed 100% specificity, full coverage of the target pathogens and a limit of detection (LOD) of </=10CFUeq./reaction. These LOD values were maintained in the multiplex format or when bacterial DNA was isolated from blood. Clinical evaluation showed high concordance between the multiplex PCR and blood culture. In conclusion, we developed a multiplex PCR that allows the direct detection of the most important bacterial pathogens causing LOS in preterm infants.
TI  - Electrospun DOXY-h loaded-poly(acrylic acid) nanofiber mats: in vitro drug release and antibacterial properties investigation.
AB  - Electrospun DOXY-h loaded-poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) nanofiber mats (PAA/DOXY-h nanofiber mats) were prepared by the electrospinning technique and post-spinning sorption method at various doses: PAA/DOXY-h125, PAA/DOXY-h250, PAA/DOXY-h500, and PAA/DOXY-h1000. The morphology, drug content, release characteristics, and antibacterial activities of the PAA/DOXY-h nanofiber mats were investigated with scanning electron microscopy, UV-vis spectrophotometry, and disc diffusion methodology. The PAA/DOXY-h nanofiber mats had a diameter range of 285-340 nm, and a smooth surface without beads. Adsorption isotherms of DOXY-h could be described well with the Freundlich model. The amounts of DOXY-h, after the post-spinning sorption process, in the PAA/DOXY-h nanofiber mats ranged between 27.57 and 101.71 mg/g. All of the PAA/DOXY-h nanofiber mats exhibited an initial burst release characteristic with cumulative releasing percentages between 37.14 and 45.97%, which followed the Fickian diffusion mechanism. Based on the antibacterial investigation, the tested gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae, seemed to be more sensitive to PAA/DOXY-h nanofiber mats than the tested gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These PAA/DOXY-h nanofiber mats could be used as an antibacterial wound dressing.
TI  - Colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip test compromising optimised combinations of anti-S. suis capsular polysaccharide polyclonal antibodies for detection of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - A rapid diagnosis kit that detects Streptococcus suis (S. suis) antigens from urine with an immunochromatographic stripe (ICS) test was developed in this study. The ICS test was produced using colloidal gold coated with polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) against S. suis. The pAbs were developed from rabbits immunised with S. suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharides (CPS). Development of the pAbs was investigated to establish their binding to CPS and to determine the maximum sensitivity of two combination antibodies for the ICS test. The results of the ICS optimisation revealed that the combinations of pAb C-N1 and pAb C-N2 had the highest sensitivity to CPS. The minimum limitation of ICS sensitivity indicated 1.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (CFU) and a CPS concentration of 0.05 microg. The assay time for detection of S. suis antigens is less than 15 min, which is suitable for rapid detection. A cross-reactive test was also conducted, and it detected no other bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae). The cross-reactivity of other serotypes in S. suis was also investigated, and tests for serotypes of 1, 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, and 16 were positive. This study presents the first report of a development of an ICS that enables the quantitative detection of streptococcal antigens. The S. suis ICS provides several advantages over other methods, including the speed and simplicity of use.
TI  - Antibacterial Activities and In Vitro Anti-Inflammatory (Membrane Stability) Properties of Methanolic Extracts of Gardenia coronaria Leaves.
AB  - This work is carried out with Gardenia coronaria leaves that belong to the family Rubiaceae, which is a small-to-medium-sized but tall, deciduous tree, 7.6-9 m high on an average. Leaves are used for the treatment of rheumatic pain and bronchitis. The leaf of the plant consists of coronalolide, coronalolic acid, coronalolide methyl ester, ethyl coronalolate acetate triterpenes (secocycloartanes), and so forth. Methanol extract from the leaves of Gardenia coronaria was completely screened for membrane stability and antibacterial activity. The lower concentrations of Methanolic leaf extract of Gardenia coronaria gave good antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity, but higher concentrations gave relatively more projecting antibacterial activity in vitro as compared with Kanamycin. The crude drug's anti-inflammatory effects were compared with those of Aspirin as positive control. The Methanolic extracts of Gardenia coronaria leaves possessed a broad spectrum antibacterial activity against a variety of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms like Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Shigella sonnei, Shigella boydii, and Proteus mirabilis, with a zone of inhibition from 10 to 16 mm. The extract also showed good membrane stability to be considered as having significant anti-inflammatory action.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against isolates collected from complicated skin and skin structure infections and intra-abdominal infections in Africa and Middle East countries: TEST 2007-2012.
AB  - Complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs) and intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) are problematic due to decreasing therapeutic options available against multidrug-resistant pathogens common among these types of infections. A total of 2245 isolates from African and the Middle Eastern (AfME) countries were collected to determine in vitro activity for tigecycline and comparators during 2007-2012 as part of the Tigecycline Evaluation Surveillance Trial program. Tigecycline was launched in the AfME in 2007 and remains active against a wide range of targeted pathogens worldwide. Isolates were recovered from cSSSI (1990) and IAI (255) from 38 sites in 11 AfME countries. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common species from cSSSI (27.9%), and the methicillin-resistant S. aureus rate was 25%. Enterococcus spp. (7.1%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (2.9%) were other common Gram-positive pathogens represented. Enterobacter spp. (14.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.9%), Escherichia coli (11.4%), Klebsiella spp. (10.9%), and Acinetobacter spp. (7.2 %) were the most common Gram-negative species collected. Tigecycline MIC(90) values were 0.25 mug/mL against S. aureus. E. coli and Enterobacter spp. had tigecycline MIC(90) values of 1 and 2 mug/mL, respectively. E. coli was the most frequently collected species from IAI (28.3%), followed by Klebsiella spp. (20.8%), Enterococcus spp. (11.8%), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (6.3%). Isolates collected from IAI had the following tigecycline MIC(90) values: E. coli (1 mug/mL), Klebsiella spp. and other Enterobacteriaceae (2 mug/mL), Enterococcus spp. (0.25 mug/mL), and S. maltophilia (1 mug/mL). Tigecycline in vitro activity was observed against a broad spectrum of bacterial species, including strains resistant to other antimicrobial classes.
TI  - Is there a need for bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis in patients undergoing urological procedures?
AB  - Heart valve repair or replacement is a serious problem.The focused update on infective endocarditis of American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2008 (ACC/AHA guidelines) and Guidelines on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infective endocarditis (new version 2009) of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC guidelines) describe prophylaxis against infective endocarditis as not recommended for urinary tract procedures in the absence of active infection. A statistical association has been recently shown between urological procedures and the development of infective endocarditis. New evidences concerning infective endocarditis due to Actinobaculum schaalii, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aerococci and Staphylococcus aureus, and new findings indicate there is a need for bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis in patients undergoing urological procedures especially in elderly patients and in cancer and immunocompromised patients, to avoid serious consequences.
TI  - The microbiology of bacterial peritonitis due to appendicitis in children.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the microbiology of secondary bacterial peritonitis due to appendicitis and the appropriateness of current antimicrobial practice in one institution. METHODS: A 14-year retrospective single-centre study of 69 consecutive paediatric patients (age 1-14 years) with appendicitis-related peritonitis and positive peritoneal specimen cultures was conducted. Post-operative outcomes, microbiology and antibiotic susceptibility of peritoneal isolates were analysed in all patients. RESULTS: Escherichia coli was identified in 56/69 (81 %) peritoneal specimens; four isolates were resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate, and one other isolate was resistant to gentamicin. Anaerobes were identified in 37/69 (54 %) peritoneal specimens; two anaerobic isolates were resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate and one isolate was resistant to metronidazole. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was identified in 4/69 (6 %) peritoneal specimens, and all were susceptible to gentamicin. Streptococcal species (two Group F streptococci and three beta-haemolytic streptococci) were identified in 5/69 (7 %) specimens, and all were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate. Combination therapy involving amoxicillin-clavulanate and aminoglycoside is appropriate empirical treatment in 68/69 (99 %) patients. Addition of metronidazole to this regime would provide 100 % initial empirical coverage. Inadequate initial empiric antibiotic treatment and the presence of amoxicillin-clavulanate resistant E. coli were independent predictors of the post-operative infectious complications observed in 14/69 (20 %) patients. CONCLUSION: E. coli and mixed anaerobes are the predominant organisms identified in secondary peritonitis from appendicitis in children. Inadequate initial empirical antibiotic and amoxicillin-clavulanate resistant E. coli may contribute to increased post-operative infectious complications. This study provides evidence-based information on choice of combination therapy for paediatric appendicitis-related bacterial peritonitis.
TI  - Superior sensitivity and decreased time to detection with the Bactec Peds Plus/F  system compared to the BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN blood culture system.
AB  - Here, we compare the sensitivities and times to detection (TTD) of BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN (PF) and Bactec Peds Plus blood culture bottles. Test bottles were inoculated with 2 ml of banked whole blood, 1-ml aliquots of antibiotic suspension, and organisms diluted to simulate a bacteremia level of 10 to 100 CFU/ml. The control bottles were inoculated with 3 ml of banked blood and organism suspensions only. The organism-drug combinations were Staphylococcus epidermidis and vancomycin, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin, Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone, Streptococcus agalactiae, ampicillin, and cefotaxime, Escherichia coli, cefotaxime, and cefepime, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, and gentamicin, Neisseria meningitidis and ceftriaxone, and Haemophilus influenzae and ceftriaxone. The control and test bottle combinations were tested in duplicate. The bottles were incubated for 5 days; 32 control and 104 test bottles were incubated. Overall, the bacterial recovery rates for the PF and Peds Plus bottles were 37% and 62%, 94% and 100% in the controls, 19% and 50% in the test bottles, and 33% and 92% in the bottles with vancomycin, respectively. No bacteria were recovered from the bottles with S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, E. coli, N. meningitidis, or H. influenzae in combination with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. The Peds Plus system detected P. aeruginosa in bottles with cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam, but the PF system recovered bacteria only in bottles with trough levels of piperacillin-tazobactam. The mean TTD were shorter in the Peds Plus system controls (14.2 versus 18.0 h; P = 0.001) and the test bottles (14.3 versus 17.8 h; P = 0.008) than in the PF bottles. Overall, we demonstrated superior sensitivity, TTD, and antibiotic neutralization in the Bactec Peds Plus system compared to those in the Pediatric FAN system.
TI  - In Vitro Antimicrobial Long-Term Evaluation of Corneal Preservation Media Against Microorganisms Using A Closed-Chamber Study Model.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the existence of in vitro long-term antimicrobial activity of Optisol-GS against microorganisms related to corneal infection using a closed-chamber study model. METHODS: Optisol-GS was contaminated with microorganisms related to corneal infections, and different times after contamination was analyzed using a closed-chamber study model. Microbial growths were analyzed by macroscopic observation. RESULTS: For Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 7 days and 14 days after contamination occurred. For Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Candida albicans, microbial growth was observed in all samples studied. For Streptococcus pneumoniae, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 72 hours after contamination. For Streptococcus pyogenes, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 7 days after contamination. For Escherichia coli, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 48 hours after contamination occurred. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that no in vitro antimicrobial effect for any microorganism analyzed was observed in contaminated Optisol-GS after 72 hours; however, effective antimicrobial activity was observed for S. aureus, Str. pneumoniae, Str. pyogenes, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli after 7 to 10 days.
TI  - Improved protease stability of the antimicrobial peptide Pin2 substituted with D-amino acids.
AB  - Cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have attracted a great interest as novel class of antibiotics that might help in the treatment of infectious diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria. However, some AMPs with high antimicrobial activities are also highly hemolytic and subject to proteolytic degradation from human and bacterial proteases that limit their pharmaceutical uses. In this work a D-diastereomer of Pandinin 2, D-Pin2, was constructed to observe if it maintained antimicrobial activity in the same range as the parental one, but with the purpose of reducing its hemolytic activity to human erythrocytes and improving its ability to resist proteolytic cleavage. Although, the hydrophobic and secondary structure characteristics of L- and D-Pin2 were to some extent similar, an important reduction in D-Pin2 hemolytic activity (30-40 %) was achieved compared to that of L-Pin2 over human erythrocytes. Furthermore, D-Pin2 had an antimicrobial activity with a MIC value of 12.5 muM towards Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and two strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in agar diffusion assays, but it was half less potent than that of L-Pin2. Nevertheless, the antimicrobial activity of D-Pin2 was equally effective as that of L-Pin2 in microdilution assays. Yet, when D- and L-Pin2 were incubated with trypsin, elastase and whole human serum, only D-Pin2 kept its antimicrobial activity towards all bacteria, but in diluted human serum, L- and D-Pin2 maintained similar peptide stability. Finally, when L- and D-Pin2 were incubated with proteases from P. aeruginosa DFU3 culture, a clinical isolated strain, D-Pin2 kept its antibiotic activity while L-Pin2 was not effective.
TI  - [The pharmacodynamic research on fuxiye, a Chinese herbal lotion for external wash].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe antisepsis, anti-swelling, and therapeutic effects of Fuxiye (FXY), a Chinese medical lotion for external wash in treating vaginitis model rats. METHODS: The cervicitis rat model was induced by agar plate diffusion, ear auricle swelling induced by dimethylbenzene, and chemical stimulus. The in vitro antibiotic actions of FXY were observed. Besides, its effects on the swelling and inflammation in model rats were also observed. RESULTS: FXY at 25 mg/mL could completely inhibit the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, pyogenic Streptococcus, and Streptococcus agalactiae. FXY at 50 mg/mL could completely inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. It obviously restrained dimethylbenzene induced ear auricle swelling. It significantly alleviated cervicitis induced by chemical stiumli. CONCLUSION: FXY showed better effects on antisepsis, anti-inflammation, and treating cervicitis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of pure platelet-rich plasma against microorganisms isolated from oral cavity.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Autologous platelet concentrates (PCs) have been extensively used in  a variety of medical fields to promote soft and hard tissue regeneration. The significance behind their use lies in the abundance of growth factors in platelets alpha-granules that promotes wound healing. In addition, antibacterial properties of PCs against various bacteria have been recently pointed out. In this study, the antimicrobial effect of pure platelet-rich plasma (P-PRP) was evaluated against oral cavity microorganisms such as Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus oralis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Blood samples were obtained from 17 patients who underwent oral surgery procedures involving the use of P-PRP. The antibacterial activity of P-PRP, evaluated as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), was determined through the microdilution twofold serial method. RESULTS: P-PRP inhibited the growth of Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus oralis, but not of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. CONCLUSIONS: P-PRP is a potentially useful substance in the fight against postoperative infections. This might represent a valuable property in adjunct to the enhancement of tissue regeneration.
TI  - Proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. Bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. The objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. METHOD: Bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. Proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an ELISA plate reader and zymography. RESULTS: We identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. Of these, six were Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium, and Streptococcus bovis) and seven were Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Serratia marcescens) organisms. Two of these, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, are recognized wound pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. Matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.
TI  - Chemical composition of 8 eucalyptus species' essential oils and the evaluation of their antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 1957, Tunisia introduced 117 species of Eucalyptus; they have been used as fire wood, for the production of mine wood and to fight erosion. Actually, Eucalyptus essential oil is traditionally used to treat respiratory tract disorders such as pharyngitis, bronchitis, and sinusitis. A few investigations were reported on the biological activities of Eucalyptus oils worldwide. In Tunisia, our previous works conducted in 2010 and 2011 had been the first reports to study the antibacterial activities against reference strains. At that time it was not possible to evaluate their antimicrobial activities against clinical bacterial strains and other pathogens such as virus and fungi. METHODS: The essential oils of eight Eucalyptus species harvested from the Jbel Abderrahman, Korbous (North East Tunisia) and Souinet arboreta (North of Tunisia) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities by disc diffusion and microbroth dilution methods against seven bacterial isolates: Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. In addition, the bactericidal, fungicidal and the antiviral activities of the tested oils were carried out. RESULTS: Twenty five components were identified by GC/FID and GC/MS. These components were used to correlate with the biological activities of the tested oils. The chemical principal component analysis identified three groups, each of them constituted a chemotype. According to the values of zone diameter and percentage of the inhibition (zdi, % I, respectively), four groups and subgroups of bacterial strains and three groups of fungal strains were characterized by their sensitivity levels to Eucalyptus oils. The cytotoxic effect and the antiviral activity varied significantly within Eucalyptus species oils. CONCLUSIONS: E. odorata showed the strongest activity against S. aureus, H. influenzae, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae and against all the tested fungal strains. In addition, E. odorata oil showed the most cytotoxic effect. However, the best antiviral activity appeared with E. bicostata. Virus pretreatment with E. bicostata essential oil showed better antiviral activity (IC(50) = 0.7 mg/ml, SI = 22.8) than cell-pretreatment (IC(50) = 4.8 mg/ml, SI = 3.33). The essential oil of E. astringens showed antiviral activity only when incubated with virus prior to cell infection. This activity was dose-dependent and the antiviral activity diminished with the decreasing essential oil concentration.
TI  - Gender and age-dependent etiology of community-acquired urinary tract infections.
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most frequent community-acquired infections worldwide. Escherichia coli is the most common UTI pathogen although underlying host factors such as patients' age and gender may influence prevalence of causative agents. In this study, 61 273 consecutive urine samples received over a 22-month period from outpatients clinics of an urban area of north Italy underwent microbiological culture with subsequent bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of positive samples. A total of 13 820 uropathogens were isolated and their prevalence analyzed according to patient's gender and age group. Overall Escherichia coli accounted for 67.6% of all isolates, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.8%), Enterococcus faecalis (6.3%), Proteus mirabilis (5.2%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%). Data stratification according to both age and gender showed E. coli isolation rates to be lower in both males aged >/=60 years (52.2%), E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa being more prevalent in this group (11.6% and 7.8%, resp.), as well as in those aged </=14 years (51.3%) in whom P. mirabilis prevalence was found to be as high as 21.2%. Streptococcus agalactiae overall prevalence was found to be 2.3% although it was shown to occur most frequently in women aged between 15 and 59 years (4.1%). Susceptibility of E. coli to oral antimicrobial agents was demonstrated to be as follows: fosfomycin (72.9%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (72.9%), ciprofloxacin (76.8%), ampicillin (48.0%), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (77.5%). In conclusion, both patients' age and gender are significant factors in determining UTIs etiology; they can increase accuracy in defining the causative uropathogen as well as providing useful guidance to empiric treatment.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of wine phenolic compounds and oenological extracts against potential respiratory pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the effect of seven wine phenolic compounds and six oenological phenolic extracts on the growth of pathogenic bacteria associated with respiratory diseases (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sp Group F, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae). METHODS AND RESULTS: Antimicrobial activity was determined using a microdilution method and quantified as IC(50) . Mor. catarrhalis was the most susceptible specie to phenolic compounds and extracts. Gallic acid and ethyl gallate were the compounds that showed the greatest antimicrobial activity. Regarding phenolic extracts, GSE (grape seed extract) and GSE-O (oligomeric-rich fraction from GSE) were the ones that displayed the strongest antimicrobial effects. CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight the antimicrobial properties of wine phenolic compounds and oenological extracts against potential respiratory pathogens. The antimicrobial activity of wine phenolic compounds was influenced by the type of phenolic compounds. Gram-negative bacteria were more susceptible than Gram-positive bacteria to the action of phenolic compounds and extracts; however, the effect was species-dependent. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: The ability to inhibit the growth of respiratory pathogenic bacteria as shown by several wine phenolic compounds and oenological extracts warrants further investigations to explore the use of grape and wine preparations in oral hygiene.
TI  - Escherichia coli Isolated from Urinary Tract Infections of Lebanese Patients between 2000 and 2009: Epidemiology and Profiles of Resistance.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the bacterial etiology of urinary tract infections in one of the busiest hospitals of Lebanon and to examine the epidemiologic and microbiologic properties of Escherichia coli isolated from urinary tract infections of Lebanese patients over a 10-year period. Methods. This retrospective study analyzed the data generated between 2000 and 2009 (10,013 Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria). Bacterial identification was based on standard culture and biochemical characteristics of isolates. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by the disk diffusion method, and ESBL production was detected by synergy with third-generation cephalosporins and amoxiclav. Results. E. coli was the most frequent isolate throughout the ten years (60.64% of the total isolates). It was followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus sp., and Streptococcus agalactiae. E. coli occurred more frequently in women (69.8%) than in men (61.4%). The lowest percentage of susceptibility of E. coli was manifested against piperacillin and ampicillin. An increase in the production of ESBL was observed (2.3% in 2000 to 16.8% in 2009). Conclusions. The etiology of urinary tract infections and their susceptibility profiles are important to be evaluated in countries like Lebanon where a severe misuse of antibiotics at all levels is observed.
TI  - The microbiology of tonsils in khamis civil hospital, saudi arabia.
AB  - Objectives. Tonsillitis is a common infection in all age groups, especially under the age of five. Organisms causing this condition vary from place to place. Our aim is to find out the main causative agents of this condition in our hospital. Patients and Methods. Fifty-two consenting patients who needed tonsillectomy in Khamis civil hospital, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, between September 2006 and April 2007, were enrolled for the study. Swabs were taken from their inner surfaces and cultured for anaerobes and aerobes according to standard microbiological techniques. Results. Fifty-two patients, consisting of 30 males and 22 females were enrolled. Their mean age was 9.81 +/- 6.47. Nearly 65% of patients had positive cultures while 35% were negative. The commonest bacteria isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (44.1%); and Group B Streptococcus (35.3 %). Two Gram-negative bacteria, Klebsiella pneumoniae, (8.82%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.94 %), were also isolated. No anaerobe was isolated. Conclusion. Gram-positive cocci, consisting of Staphylococcus aureus and Group B Streptococcus (Streptococcus agalactiae), are the major causes of tonsillitis requiring surgery in our hospital. Antibiotic treatment of this condition should be directed largely against these organisms.
TI  - Structure of plantaricin locus of Lactobacillus plantarum 8P-A3.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum 8P-A3 is a strain which is well known on the Russian pharmaceutical market and it is included in several probiotic products. The strain has been widely used since 1973 but the mechanisms of its antibacterial activity were unknown. L. plantarum 8P-A3 expressed high antagonistic activity against the wide range of bacterial pathogens including Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains. DNA sequence analysis of L. plantarum 8P-A3 genome revealed the presence of a complete plantaricin locus of about 20,000 bp encoding genes of at least two bacteriocins--plantaricins EF and NC8. The plantaricin locus found in L. plantarum 8P-A3 is homologous to the plantaricin cluster in L. plantarum J51.
TI  - Microbiology at first visit of moderate-to-severe diabetic foot infection with antimicrobial activity and a survey of quinolone monotherapy.
AB  - Samples from 1295 patients with diabetic foot infection were evaluated; 4332 samples were collected with an average of 3.3 samples per patient. Fifty-seven percent of patients had a 2B ulcer and 23% had a 3B ulcer according to Texas University Classification. In 64.2% of samples collected at first visit an etiologic agent was identified. About 40% of the positive samples were polymicrobial. Gram positive bacteria were more frequently isolated (52.6%), Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated single agent (29.9%) and MRSA was 22% of S. aureus. Enterococcus spp., mainly Enterococcus faecalis, were 9.9%, all vancomycin susceptible except 2 isolates. Streptococci were 4.6%, more than 60% Streptococcus agalactiae. Gram negative rods were 40.6%, with enterobacteria 23.5% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 10.3%. Anaerobes were only 0.3%, probably due to culture methods applied in our laboratory. Cotrimoxazole, rifampin and doxycycline were still active against S. aureus. ESBL producers, among enterobacteria, were 10%, mainly Escherichia coli and Proteus spp. Only colistin had a rate of susceptibility against P. aeruginosa above 90%. Levofloxacin had the best clinical activity with respect to the other quinolones, but when it failed, selected more resistant strains with respect to moxifloxacin among S. aureus and with respect to ciprofloxacin among P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Urinary tract infection in patient after brain injury].
AB  - INTRUDUCTION: One of the most important problems in treating patients after head  injury is urinary complication. The first place take urinary infections, which disturb rehabilitation process. Clean intermittent catherization, bladder training and good care do not preserve infection. The purpose of our study was to present the frequency of urinary infections and main pathogens involved in these infections among patients treated in The Department of Rehabilitation after head injury. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We gathered microbiological tests and observations from 398 patients (from 2 to 73 years old) after head injury treated in years 2003-2005. Some of them survived head injury and some of them had also multiorgan injury. RESULTS: In 133 of them we found bladder and urethra infections, vesical calculus in 11 cases. In one case we found prostatic abscessus and in one case urethroscrotal fistula. Each patient had microbiological test of urine after he was admitted to the Department. If the test was positive he had pharmacological treatment. In 157 urinary infections we selected Proteus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Enterococcus sp., Acinetobacter sp. Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae and Candida albicans was represented not so often. CONCLUSIONS: The most frequent pathogens were: Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli. Most of patients had positive microbiological tests at the admittance to our Department. These complications extend the rehabilitation process and generate high costs. It is necessary to create standards of care of neuropathic bladder in patients after head injury.
TI  - Evaluation antimicrobial and antiadhesive properties of the biosurfactant Lunasan produced by Candida sphaerica UCP 0995.
AB  - Different groups of biosurfactants exhibit diverse properties and display a variety of physiological functions in producer microorganisms; these include enhancing the solubility of hydrophobic/water-insoluble compound, heave metal binding, bacterial pathogenesis, cell adhesion and aggregation, quorum sensing and biofilm formation. Candida sphaerica was grown in a low cost medium, consisting of distilled water supplemented with 9% refinery residue of soybean oil and 9% corn steep liquor, for 144 h at 28 degrees C and 150 rpm. The cell-free supernatant obtained at the end of the experiments was submitted to extraction, and afterward the biosurfactant was isolated using methanol with a yield of 9 g l(-1). The critical micelle concentration of the biosurfactant was found to be 0.25 mg ml(-1) with a surface tension of 25 mN m(-1). Several concentrations of the biosurfactant (0.625-10 mg ml(-1)) were used to evaluate its antimicrobial and antiadhesive activities against a variety of microorganisms. The biosurfactant showed antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus oralis (68%), Candida albicans (57%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis(57.6%) for the highest concentration tested. Furthermore, the biosurfactant at a concentration of 10 mg ml(-1) inhibited the adhesion between 80 and 92% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus sanguis12. Inhibition of adhesion with percentages near 100% occurred for the higher concentrations of biosurfactant used. Results gathered in this study point to a potential use of the biosurfactant in biomedical applications.
TI  - Nationwide survey of antibacterial activity against clinical isolates from urinary tract infections in Japan (2008).
AB  - In this study, the causative bacteria and their sensitivity to various antimicrobial agents as well as risk factors for quinolone-resistant Escherichia coli were investigated in patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis or complicated cystitis by isolation and culture of bacteria from urine samples. In total, 1312 strains were isolated from 1009 patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis, including E. coli (63.3%), Enterococcus faecalis (12.8%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (4.6%). In addition, 994 strains were isolated from 725 patients with complicated cystitis, including E. coli (36.4%), E. faecalis (19.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.0%), S. agalactiae (4.7%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.5%). At least 90% of E. coli isolates from acute uncomplicated cystitis showed sensitivity to fluoroquinolones and cephems, whilst 70.4-88.4% of E. coli isolates from complicated cystitis were sensitive to fluoroquinolones and 85.4-89.5% were sensitive to cephems. Factors associated with quinolone-resistant E. coli included two or more episodes of cystitis within 1 year, failure of quinolone therapy, underlying urinary tract disease, prior quinolone treatment within 1 month and age >/= 75 years. It is important to confirm the sensitivity of causative bacteria for optimal antimicrobial therapy, and empirical antimicrobial agents should be selected by considering patient characteristics and other factors.
TI  - Predictive factors for lower extremity amputations in diabetic foot infections.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the epidemiology of diabetic foot infections (DFIs) and its predictive factors for lower extremity amputations. A prospective study of 100 patients with DFIs treated at the National University Hospital of Singapore were recruited in the study during the period of January 2005-June 2005. A protocol was designed to document patient's demographics, type of DFI, presence of neuropathy and/or vasculopathy and its final outcome. Predictive factors for limb loss were determined using univariate and stepwise logistic regression analysis. The mean age of the study population was 59.8 years with a male to female ratio of about 1:1 and with a mean follow-up duration of about 24 months. All patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus. Common DFIs included abscess (32%), wet gangrene (29%), infected ulcers (19%), osteomyelitis (13%), necrotizing fasciitis (4%) and cellulitis (3%). Thirteen patients were treated conservatively, while surgical debridement or distal amputation was performed in 59 patients. Twenty-eight patients had major amputations (below or above knee) performed. Forty-eight percent had monomicrobial infections compared with 52% with polymicrobial infections. The most common pathogens found in all infections (both monomicrobial and polymicrobial) were Staphylococcus aureus (39.7%), Bacteroides fragilis (30.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (26.0%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (21.0%). Significant univariate predictive factors for limb loss included age above 60 years, gangrene, ankle-brachial index (ABI) <0.8, monomicrobial infections, white blood cell (WBC) count >/= 15.0x10(9)/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate >/=100 mm/hr, C-reactive protein >/=15.0 mg/dL, hemoglobin (Hb) </=10.0g/dL and creatinine >/=150 micromol/L. Upon stepwise logistic regression, only gangrene, ABI <0.8, WBC >/= 15.0x10(9)/L and Hb </=10.0g/dL were significant.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of E-101 Solution, a novel myeloperoxidase-mediated antimicrobial, against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: E-101 Solution (E-101) is a novel myeloperoxidase-mediated antimicrobial. It is composed of porcine myeloperoxidase (pMPO), glucose oxidase, glucose as the substrate and specific amino acids in an aqueous vehicle. E-101 is being developed for topical application directly into surgical wounds to prevent surgical site infections (SSIs). The in vitro activity of E-101 was investigated. METHODS: MIC, MBC, time-kill and antimicrobial combination experiments were performed according to CLSI guidelines with modifications. Resistance selection studies were performed using a serial passage method. RESULTS: E-101 showed MIC(90) values of 0.03, 0.5 and 0.5 mg pMPO/L for staphylococci (n = 140), streptococci (n = 95) and enterococci (n = 55), respectively. MIC(90) values ranged between 0.03-0.5 and </= 0.004-0.12 mg pMPO/L for Enterobacteriaceae (n = 148) and Gram-negative non-Enterobacteriaceae (n = 92) strains, respectively. There was no antimicrobial tolerance to E-101 for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae or Streptococcus pyogenes. Time-kill studies demonstrated a rapid (<30 min) bactericidal effect against S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner. There was no evidence of stable resistance to E-101 among staphylococci, enterococci, E. coli or P. aeruginosa strains and no evidence of E-101 interaction with antibiotics commonly used in clinical medicine. Conclusions E-101 shows potent and broad-spectrum in vitro activity against bacteria that are the causative pathogens of SSIs, thereby providing the impetus to test its clinical utility in the prevention of SSIs.
TI  - Real-time PCR assays compared to culture-based approaches for identification of aerobic bacteria in chronic wounds.
AB  - Chronic wounds cause substantial morbidity and disability. Infection in chronic wounds is clinically defined by routine culture methods that can take several days to obtain a final result, and may not fully describe the community of organisms or biome within these wounds. Molecular diagnostic approaches offer promise for a more rapid and complete assessment. We report the development of a suite of real-time PCR assays for rapid identification of bacteria directly from tissue samples. The panel of assays targets 14 common, clinically relevant, aerobic pathogens and demonstrates a high degree of sensitivity and specificity using a panel of organisms commonly associated with chronic wound infection. Thirty-nine tissue samples from 29 chronic wounds were evaluated and the results compared with those obtained by culture. As revealed by culture and PCR, the most common organisms were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) followed by Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B streptococcus) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The sensitivities of the PCR assays were 100% and 90% when quantitative and qualitative culture results were used as the reference standard, respectively. The assays allowed the identification of bacterial DNA from ten additional organisms that were not revealed by quantitative or qualitative cultures. Under optimal conditions, the turnaround time for PCR results is as short as 4-6 h. Real-time PCR is a rapid and inexpensive approach that can be easily introduced into clinical practice for detection of organisms directly from tissue samples. Characterization of the anaerobic microflora by real-time PCR of chronic wounds is warranted.
TI  - Myeloperoxidase selectively binds and selectively kills microbes.
AB  - Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is reported to selectively bind to bacteria. The present study provides direct evidence of MPO binding selectivity and tests the relationship of selective binding to selective killing. The microbicidal effectiveness of H(2)O(2) and of OCl(-) was compared to that of MPO plus H(2)O(2). Synergistic microbicidal action was investigated by combining Streptococcus sanguinis, a H(2)O(2)-producing microbe showing low MPO binding, with high-MPO-binding Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa without exogenous H(2)O(2), with and without MPO, and with and without erythrocytes (red blood cells [RBCs]). Selectivity of MPO microbicidal action was conventionally measured as the MPO MIC and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) for 82 bacteria including E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and viridans streptococci. Both H(2)O(2) and OCl(-) destroyed RBCs at submicrobicidal concentrations. Nanomolar concentrations of MPO increased H(2)O(2) microbicidal action 1,000-fold. Streptococci plus MPO produced potent synergistic microbicidal action against all microbes tested, and RBCs caused only a small decrease in potency without erythrocyte damage. MPO directly killed H(2)O(2)-producing S. pyogenes but was ineffective against non-H(2)O(2)-producing E. faecalis. The MPO MICs and MBCs for E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus were significantly lower than those for E. faecalis. The streptococcal studies showed much higher MIC/MBC results, but such testing required lysed horse blood-supplemented medium, thus preventing valid comparison of these results to those for the other microbes. E. faecalis MPO binding is reportedly weak compared to binding of E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus but strong compared to binding of streptococci. Selective MPO binding results in selective killing.
TI  - Mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  - The oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. When this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. Generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. The mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. Several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the Streptococcus (Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis) and Staphylococcus (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Porphyromonas gingivalis. In addition, some members of both the Streptococcus and the Staphylococcus genera, as well as Porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. The current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. The pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.
TI  - Microbial colonization of tracheoesophageal voice prostheses (Provox2) following  total laryngectomy.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the presence of individual microorganisms and the most frequent microbial combinations in the biofilm of the indwelling Provox2 voice prosthesis in situ. Furthermore, we wanted to evaluate the possible influence of biofilm composition on the mean and median lifetime of these voice prostheses. Over a 5-year period, implantation of a Provox2 voice prosthesis was performed in 85 patients, or 90% of the overall number of patients who underwent total laryngectomy. In total 100 implanted voice prostheses, at least one of every patient, were microbiologically processed immediately after being replaced. Out of the total of 292 isolates, 67% were bacteria and the remaining 33% were yeasts. The most frequently found yeast species on voice prostheses biofilms was C. albicans, followed by C. krusei and C. tropicalis. The most frequently isolated bacteria included Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus agalactiae. Simultaneous presence of bacteria and fungi was established in 83% of the processed voice prostheses; in 16% of samples the biofilm contained only one or more bacterial species. The mean time of implantation was 238 days and the median lifetime of the device was 180 days. Dividing the prostheses in four groups according to the composition of biofilm revealed that the device lifetimes varied significantly between groups. The longest lifetime of voice prostheses was associated with the presence of single fungal isolate in combination with bacteria. There is a significant correlation between biofilm composition and the device life time.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against patient isolates collected during phase  3 clinical trials for diabetic foot infections.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparative antimicrobial agents was evaluated against 1828 primary baseline pathogens isolated from 844 patients enrolled in the phase 3 clinical trials investigating the efficacy of tigecycline in diabetic foot infection (DFI). The trials were global, enrolling patients in 30 countries. Tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens in DFI, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with 95% of MICs < or =2 microg/mL for the entire collection. The spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens for DFI, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis. As reported previously, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and several pathogens in the Proteeae group were generally less susceptible to tigecycline by comparison to other Gram-negative pathogens. The excellent in vitro expanded broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline in the clinical isolates confirmed the potential utility of tigecycline for pathogens associated with DFIs.
TI  - Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity- and complement-dependent cytotoxicity-independent bactericidal activity of an IgG against Pseudomonas aeruginosa O6ad.
AB  - In addition to Ag recognition, some Abs are capable of killing target organisms in the absence of phagocytes and complement. In this study, we report that an anti-Pseudomonas aeruginosa O6ad LPS IgG(1), tobacco-expressed human S20 IgG(1) (te-hS20), as well as its recombinant Fab and single-chain variable fragment (scFv) fragments have cellular- and complement-independent bactericidal activity. te-hS20 and its Fab and scFv significantly reduced viability of P. aeruginosa O6ad in dose- and time-dependent manners in vitro and also showed lower levels of bactericidal activity against P. aeruginosa PAO1, but had no activity against P. aeruginosa O10, Escherichia coli TG1, and Streptococcus agalactiae. The H chain and its Fd fragment both had significant Ag-binding and bactericidal activities against P. aeruginosa O6ad. Bactericidal activity was completely inhibited with specific LPS Ag, suggesting that Ag binding is involved in the bactericidal mechanism. Live/dead cell staining and electron microscopic observations indicate that the bactericidal effect was due to disruption of the cell wall and suggest inhibition of cell division. In addition to te-hS20, the Fab and scFv were also protective in vivo, as leukopenic mice had prolonged and improved survival after administration of these Ab fragments followed by challenge with P. aeruginosa O6ad cells at 80-90% lethal dose, supporting a bactericidal mechanism independent of phagocytes and complement. Understanding of the bactericidal mechanism will allow assessment of the potential for therapeutic application of these Abs.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms: tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial 2004 to 2007.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial began in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Against Gram negatives (n = 63 699), tigecycline MIC(90)'s ranged from 0.25 to 2 mg/L for Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens (but was > or =32 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Against Gram-positive organisms (n = 32 218), tigecycline MIC(90)'s were between 0.06 and 0.25 mg/L for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. The in vitro activity of tigecycline was maintained against resistant phenotypes, including multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (9.2% of isolates), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (7.0%) and K. pneumoniae (14.0%), beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae (22.2%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (44.5%), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (45.9%) and E. faecalis (2.8%), and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (13.8%). Tigecycline represents a welcome addition to the armamentarium against difficult to treat organisms.
TI  - Synthesis, spectroscopic characterization and antibacterial activity of new cobalt(II) complexes of unsymmetrical tetradentate (OSN2) Schiff base ligands.
AB  - Cobalt ion complexes with the Schiff bases, (4-X-2-{[2-(2-pyridine-2-yl-ethylsulfanyl)ethylimino]methyl}phenol (X=methoxy (OMe), phenylazo (N(2)Ph), bromo (Br), nitro (NO(2))),were synthesized and investigated by several techniques using elemental analysis (C, H, N), FTIR, electronic spectra and molar conductivity. The thermal stability of free ligands and related cobalt complexes were studied by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analyses (TGA). Cyclic voltammetry indicates that the investigated cobalt complexes, under the experimental conditions, have irreversible redox behavior. The synthesized compounds have antibacterial activity against the four Gram-positive bacteria: Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus anthracis and also against the two Gram-negative bacteria: Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The activity data show that the parent Schiff bases are more potent antibacterials than the cobalt complexes.
TI  - Comparison of clinical symptoms scored according to the National Institutes of Health chronic prostatitis symptoms index and assessment of antimicrobial treatment in patients with chronic prostatitis syndrome.
AB  - We examined a total of 194 patients over 18 years of age with chronic prostatitis syndrome and no evidence of structural or functional lower genitourinary tract abnormalities. The following data were obtained for each patient: clinical history--the severity of chronic prostatitis symptoms scored by a Croatian translation of the NiH CPSI questionnaire, clinical status including digitorectal examination, urethral swab specimens, and selective samples of urine and expressed prostatic secretion, according to the 4-glass localization test (meares and Stamey localization technique). Patients were treated orally with antimicrobial agents in doses and duration according to clinical practice in Croatia. An infectious etiology was determined in 169 (87%) patients. Chlamydia trachomatis was the causative pathogen in 38 (20%), Trichomonas vaginalis in 35 (18%), Enterococcus in 36 (19%) and Escherichia coli in 35 (18%) patients. In the remaining 25 patients the following causative pathogens were found: Ureaplasma urealyticum, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Comparison of symptoms scores and effect on quality of life has shown that the most severe clinical presentation of disease was recorded in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by E. coli and Enterococcus (p<0.001). Clinical success was paralleled by bacteriological eradication in chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by C. trachomatis, Enterococcus and E. coli (kappa >0.2<0.5), but not in inflammatory chronic pelvic pain syndrome caused by T. vaginalis.
TI  - Monitoring major mastitis pathogens at the population level based on examination  of bulk tank milk samples.
AB  - The objective was to determine the proportions and bacterial counts of major mastitis pathogens in samples of bulk tank milk (BTM), as well as to clarify the relationship between these bacteria counts and bulk tank somatic cell count (BTSCC). The purpose was to judge the importance of the counts of mammary pathogens for BTSCC at the population level. Samples of BTM were collected from 268 randomly selected anonymous dairy herds (with approximately 29 000 dairy cows). Staphylococcus aureus, other coagulase-positive staphylococci, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus dysgalactiae were grouped as contagious pathogens, and Streptococcus uberis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium as environmental pathogens. Based on assessment of the dominant pathogen in each herd, environmental pathogens were found to dominate. Counts of specific mammary pathogens in BTM samples did not exceed a geometric mean of 1000 cfu/ml. Significant differences were documented in BTSCC between BTM samples containing Str. agalactiae, Staph. aureus, and Str. dysgalactiae and BTM samples that were pathogen-free. Geometric means of BTSCC associated with these pathogens were noticeably higher than the overall BTSCC (Str. agalactiae 243 628; Staph. aureus 205 610; Str. dysgalactiae 203 978; overall 173 000 cells/ml). It follows that the somatic cell count (SCC) associated with these pathogens contributed substantially to the overall BTSCC. Environmental pathogens predominated in samples of BTM with SCC <300x103/ml and contagious mastitis pathogens predominated in BTM samples with SCC >300x103/ml. No correlation was detected between bacterial counts of specific pathogens and BTSCC. This study revealed that the assessment of bacterial counts of mammary pathogens in samples of BTM in relation to BTSCC is applicable for the monitoring of changes in the occurrence of major mastitis pathogens in dairy herds at a national level.
TI  - Surfactants as microbicides and contraceptive agents: a systematic in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The urgent need for cheap and easy-to-use protection against both unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases has stimulated considerable interest in the use of surfactants as microbicides, anti-viral, and contraceptive agents in recent years. In the present study we report a systematic in vitro evaluation of the microbicidal, anti-viral and contraceptive potential of cationic, anionic, zwitterionic, and non-ionic surfactants. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Toxicity was evaluated in mammalian columnar epithelial (MDCK) cells, human sperm cells, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Enterococcus faecalis. The inhibition of adenovirus and lentivirus infection of MDCK cells was also tested. A homologous series of cationic surfactants, alkyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium bromides (C(n)TAB), with varying alkyl chains were shown to be bactericidal and fungicidal at doses that were related to the surfactant critical micelle concentrations (CMC), all of them at concentrations significantly below the CMC. In general, bacteria were more susceptible to this surfactant group than C. albicans and this organism, in turn, was more susceptible than MDCK cells. This suggests that the C(n)TAB may be useful as vaginal disinfectants only in so far as bacterial and fungal infections are concerned. None of the surfactants examined, including those that have been used in pre-clinical studies, showed inhibition of adenovirus or lentivirus infection of MDCK cells or spermicidal activity at doses that were sub-toxic to MDCK cells. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this study lead us to propose that systematic analysis of surfactant toxicity, such as we report in the present work, be made a mandatory pre-condition for the use of these substances in pre-clinical animal and/or human studies.
TI  - The establishment of resistance phenotypes for bacteria isolated from outpatients in urine cultures.
AB  - From 1911 outpatients, who addressed a Timisoara private clinical laboratory, from January to December 2005, we collected 1,889 urine cultures, 431 being positive. Bacteria identification was generally done using morphological, cultural, biochemical characters and pathogenicity tests. Sensitivity testing to antimicrobial medical drugs was done by using the classical diffusion Kirby-Bauer method and the automatic analyzer Osiris, also. The main bacteria involved in the etiology of these infections were represented by Enterobacteriaceae, head of the list being Escherichia coli (81.21%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.35%) and Proteus mirabilis (3.02%). We also isolated Gram positive cocci (in a much smaller proportion), mainly represented by Enterococcus faecalis (1.16%), Staphylococcus aureus (0.93%), Streptococcus agalactiae, and also Gram negative non-fermentative bacilli, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.93%) or Acinetobacter baumanii (0.23%). As soon as we performed the sensitivity tests, we divided them in resistance phenotypes: Most of the Enterobacteriaceae were integrated in the wild phenotype, followed by the penicillinase producing phenotype. An E. coli strain (0.29%) and 3 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains (8.33%) were integrated in the large spectrum, multidrug resistant, beta-lactamase producing phenotype, also associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides; Non-fermentative bacilli did not present special resistance problems, the four Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were integrated in the wild phenotype (secreting induced chromosomal cephalosporinase). As for Staphylococcus aureus it was identified a strain having fluoroquinolone resistance, two strains secreting penicillinase and having a K (Nm) phenotype and a strain secreting penicillinase only. Antibiotic resistance represents a major concern for patients, physicians, healthcare managers, and policymakers. The use of antibiotics is closely linked with the development of acquired antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of tigecycline against aerobic and facultative isolates recovered from hospitalized patients: an Argentinean multicenter study.
AB  - Tigecycline, the 9-t-butylglycylamino derivative of minocycline is the first commercially available glycylcycline exhibiting an extended spectrum of antibacterial activity due to its capacity to evade the tetracycline ribosomal and efflux resistance mechanisms. We conducted a collaborative in vitro study determining the activity of tigecycline compared to 14 antimicrobials against clinically relevant isolates obtained from adult patients hospitalized in 9 Argentinean institutions. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the reference broth microdilution method. The number of isolates and MICs 50/90 (mg/L) for tigecycline were the following: Acinetobacter spp. 132 (0.5/1); Escherichia coli 220 (0.12/0.25); Klebsiella spp. 220 (0.5/1), Enterobacter spp. 205 (0.5/1); Serratia spp. 84 (0.5/2); Haemophilus influenzae 96 (0.25/0.5); Staphylococcus aureus 223 (0.12/0.25); Streptococcus pneumoniae 98 (<or= 0.25/1); S. agalactiae 51 (0.5/0.5); Enterococcus spp. 104 (0.06/0.12); Pseudomonas aeruginosa 169 (8/16). We conclude that tigecycline is a promising drug for the treatment of infections in hospitalized patients in Argentina.
TI  - Improved diagnosis specificity in bone and joint infections using molecular techniques.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The microbiological diagnosis of osteoarticular infections currently  relies on microbiological cultures, to specifically target treatment. However, these conventional methods sometimes lack of sensitivity and of specificity to establish definitive diagnosis. This study was conducted to determine whether molecular method could improve bacterial bone and joint infection diagnosis. METHODS: We evaluated the performance of nucleic acid extraction with the semi-automated NucliSens miniMAG instrument coupled to 16S rDNA sequencing on 76 samples collected from 51 patients with suspected infections: prosthetic-joint infection (15), spondylodiscitis (7) acute septic arthritis (11) and 18 controls. No pre-treatment of the sample was done before nucleic acid extraction. Classification in infected group required an accumulation of arguments. RESULTS: Our molecular method identified a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and fastidious bacteria like Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The overall PCR sensitivity was 73.3%: 53.8% for prosthetic-joint infections and 88.2% for infections without prostheses. The overall PCR specificity was 95.2%, whereas culture specificity was only 85.7%. CONCLUSIONS: The instrument was simple to use and provided nucleic acids free of PCR inhibitors and free of contamination by foreign bacterial DNA. Our study highlights the need for still improved molecular diagnostic sensitivity.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Quercus ilex bark's extracts.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of different extracts of Quercus ilex bark (Fagaceae)  was studied in vitro against seven reference strains of bacteria by using a disc-diffusion method and agar-dilution method. The ethyl acetate extract (QE), n-butanol extract (QB) and final aqueous layer (QA) were effective against all bacterial strains tested at MICs ranging from 128 to 512 microg/ml. The n-hexane extract (QH) and dichloromethane extract (QD) showed no activity.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - Comparison of BACTEC PLUS blood culture media to BacT/Alert FA blood culture media for detection of bacterial pathogens in samples containing therapeutic levels of antibiotics.
AB  - Blood culture bottles with antimicrobial removal systems are recommended for patients who develop fever while on antibiotics. This study compared the ability of Becton Dickinson (Sparks, MD) BACTEC PLUS bottles and bioMerieux (Durham, NC) BacT/Alert FA bottles to effectively remove vancomycin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin, oxacillin, gentamicin, and a combination of gentamicin/penicillin, thus allowing bacterial pathogens to grow. Each bottle was spiked with 10 ml of human blood, antibiotic, and strains of organisms susceptible to the antibiotic evaluated. The organisms used were type strains and clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible and resistant), Streptococcus pneumoniae, a viridans streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Testing was completed in triplicate, using 10 to 100 CFU/ml of organisms with various concentrations of each antibiotic. Two rounds of testing were completed per antibiotic/organism combination. Bottles were mixed and loaded onto their respective instruments as per the manufacturer's instructions. Antimicrobial removal was evaluated on the basis of time to detection of organism growth, for up to 5 days of incubation. Overall, the BacT/Alert FA system recovered 25.1% of strains from test bottles and 96.9% of strains from growth control bottles (no antibiotic added), and the BACTEC PLUS system recovered 95.1% of strains from test bottles and 100% of strains from growth control bottles. Both systems performed well in the detection of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of gentamicin. In the presence of ceftriaxone, neither system was able to recover Streptococcus pneumoniae. The ability to remove vancomycin and cefoxitin was also determined by measuring antibiotic levels remaining in bottles after 1 h of incubation. The results demonstrated remaining levels of 72 to 90% of vancomycin and 71 to 72% of cefoxitin in the BacT/Alert system. For the BACTEC system, remaining levels were 0 to 30% of vancomycin and 0% of cefoxitin. Under these simulated conditions, the BACTEC PLUS system was superior to the BacT/Alert FA system in recovering gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics, gentamicin/penicillin, and vancomycin.
TI  - Etiological agents of dairy cows' mastitis in western part of Poland.
AB  - The purpose of the study was to determine the etiological mastitis agents in cows from herds located in the western part of Poland in years 2003-2005. Bacteriological examinations of 18,713 samples taken from California Mastitis Test (CMT) positive quarters were performed according to standard methods. Some Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci were examined with the use of API tests (Analytical Profile Index). It was found that 32.7% of samples that were CMT positive were culture negative and 9.3% of samples were contaminated. Streptococcus species (15.7%), coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) (14.6%), Staph. aureus (8.6%), Gram-negative bacilli (4.0%) and Corynebacterium species (3.8%) were most frequently isolated. Escherichia coli (52.3%) dominated among Gram-negative bacilli followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.6%), Enterobacter cloacae (3.6%), Serratia marcescens (3.1%), Pasteurella multocida (3.1%), Acinetobacter lwofii (3.1%), and 26 other bacteria species. Stahylococcus xylosus (31.5%), Staph. hyicus (12.2%), Staph. haemolyticus (12.2%), Staph. sciuri (11.6%), Staph. chromogenes (8.8%), Staph. epidermidis (8.3%) and Staph. simulans (6.1%) were the most frequent CNS. Streptococcus uberis (50%), Str. dysgalactiae (19.7%), Str. acidominimus (6.6%) and Enterococcus faecalis (5.3%) were mostly found among CAMP-negative streptococci. An increase in frequency of mastitis caused by non-agalactiae streptococci, Staph. aureus, A. pyogenes and yeast-like fungi and a decrease in that produced by Str. agalactiae in 2005 as compared to years 2003 or 2004 were observed.
TI  - [Clinical effect of continuous infusion of meropenem on bacterial pneumonia in the elderly].
AB  - We studied the clinical effect of continuous infusion over 24 hours of meropenem  (MEPM) on bacterial pneumonia in the elderly (over 65). The subjects were 26 patients (community-acquired pneumonia: moderate, n = 9; severe, n= 4; hospital-acquired pneumonia: group III, n = 13) whose performance status was 3 or 4. MEPM 1.0g/day was infused continuously for 7-14 days, and its clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy, and side effects were examined prospectively. It was effective in 23 of the 26 patients (community-acquired pneumonia: moderate, 8/9; severe, 3/4; hospital-acquired pneumonia: group III, 12/13; efficacy rate: 88.5%). Bactericidal effects were obtained in 3 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of methicillin-sensitive Staphlococcus aureus, 1 strain of Streptococcus agalactiae and 1 strain of Proteus mirabilis, but not in 2 strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus, 1 strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 1 strain of Serratia marcescens. Mild abnormal laboratory findings were observed in 2 patients: elevation of GPT, gamma-GTP, BUN and elevation of ALP. Based on the above, continuous infusion of MEPM on bacterial pneumonia in the elderly obtained excellent clinical effects. Further study is needed to compare the efficacy of continuous versus intermittent administration of MEPM.
TI  - [Use of transport medium in sputum bacterial culture examination of lower airway  infection].
AB  - Our medical institution does not have a bacterial culture facility, requiring outsourcing of bacterial culture tests. Due to the time elapsed from the time of specimen collection to culturing, the identification of causative bacteria in respiratory tract infections tends to be difficult. We therefore used transport medium for sputum bacteria examinations. Expectorated purulent or purulent-mucous sputum specimens were collected from 32 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. We divided each of the sputum specimens into the two treatment groups: transport medium (Seedswab gamma2) ndar and stad disinfection container. Paired samples prepared from each patient were sent out for bacterial culture together. The time elapsed from collection to delivery to the lab were as follows: day 0 (same day, n = 14 patients), day 1 (n = 15), day 2 (n = 2), and day 3 (n = 1). The identified causative bacteria were Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 6 patients), Haemophilus influenzae (n =5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 2), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1), and Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 1). Samples prepared by each of the two methods gave similar results. The utility of transport medium for examination of general bacteria for lower airway infection from sputum samples was not demonstrated. The rate of detection of bacteria decreased, when the transport of samples was delayed. Therefore, we need to send the sputum specimens as quickly as possible.
TI  - Lower extremity reconstruction after necrotising fasciitis and necrotic skin lesions using a porcine-derived skin substitute.
AB  - Seven consecutive clinical cases of necrotising fasciitis or necrotic skin lesions (42-78 years old; average 65.0 years of age, three females and four males) due to group A Streptococcus, group B Streptococcus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the lower extremities, who demonstrated rapid systemic symptoms, were investigated for the usefulness of a bilayer artificial dermis, derived from porcine tendons, over 4 +/- 2.4 years (1-7 years). All surgical debridement was confirmed as sufficiently deep and wide for clinically infected lesions and artificial dermis was applied to all wounds. The average interval to secondary split-thickness skin grafting was about 17.5 days (17.5 +/- 2.44 days, 21 days max., 14 days min.) and the average thickness was 0.009 +/- 0.0022 in. (range: 0.006 - 0.012 in.). No clinical problems were noted during the application of the artificial dermis and the subsequent skin grafting. Since, the donated skin graft was thin, the morbidity was minimised. The use of artificial dermis after extensive surgical debridement in necrotising fasciitis was easy and effective. Local or systemic infection was negligible.
TI  - Universal primers for detection of common bacterial pathogens causing prosthetic  joint infection.
AB  - The diagnosis of low grade prosthetic joint infection is difficult and time consuming. Nested-PCR for universal bacterial DNA segments detection of "orthopaedic" bacteria was tested in a laboratory setting. This method is based on amplification of the 16S bacterial ribosomal RNA coding sequences. 11 species of the most frequent bacterial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens) involved in prosthetic joint infections were studied. All could be detected rapidly and sensitively by this method.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2003). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from 565 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 14 institutions in Japan were collected between August 2003 and July 2004. The susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. Of them, 701 strains were estimated as prophlogistic bacteria and used for the investigation. The strains consisted of 258 Gram-positive bacterial strains (36.8%) and 443 Gram-negative bacterial strains (63.2%). Against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 2 microg/mL. Against Streptococcus agalactiae, ampicillin (ABPC), cefozopran (CZOP), imipenem (IPM), and clarithromycin (CAM) showed a strong activity and the MIC90 was 0.125 microg/mL or less. Against Enterococcus faecalis, VCM, ABPC, and IPM showed a strong antibacterial activity. The antibacterial activity of cephems to Escherichia coli was generally good, and especially CZOP and cefpirome (CPR) showed the strongest activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Quinolone resistant E. coli [MIC of ciprofloxacin (CPFX): > or =4 microg/mL] was detected at frequency of 15.7%, which was higher than that in the last year. Against Klebsiella pneumoniae, meropenem (MEPM) showed the strongest activity and next, the antibacterial activity of CRMN and CZOP was good. The antibacterial activity of the other cephems, however, significantly decreased, compared with that evaluated in last year. Against Serratia marcescens, MEPM had the strongest antibacterial activity. Against Proteus mirabilis, MEPM and CRMN showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/mL or less. Nest, cefmenoxime (CMX), ceftazidime (CAZ), cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX), CPR, CZOP, and cefditoren (CDTR) showed a strong activity. The antibacterial activity of the drugs to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and MIC90 of all the drugs was ranged from 32 to < or = 256 microg/mL except IPM and amikacin (AMK) having 16 microg/mL. The antibacterial activity of CZOP was relatively good (MIC50: 2 microg/mL).
TI  - A retrospective study of the aetiology and temporal distribution of bovine clinical mastitis in smallholder dairy herds in the Dar es Salaam region of Tanzania.
AB  - A 31-year record-based retrospective study was carried out to determine the aetiology and temporal distribution of bovine clinical mastitis in smallholder dairy herds in the Dar es Salaam region of Tanzania over the period November 1971-December 2002. Laboratory information on 1964 quarter samples from 1365 cows in 281 smallholder dairy herds were retrieved, compiled and studied. Eighty-eight percent of the quarter samples were culture-positive and the predominant mastitis pathogens isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (25.7%), Streptococcus agalactiae (15.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.3%) and Escherichia coli (14.1%). Other isolates included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.5%), Streptococcus dysgalactiae (5.2%) and Streptococcus uberis (4.2%). Contagious mastitis pathogens were isolated from 45.6% of the culture-positive samples, whereas environmental and miscellaneous pathogens were isolated from 48.2% and 5.7%, respectively. Thirty percent of the miscellaneous mastitis pathogens were Candida species. The results demonstrate a steady increase in clinical Candida albicans mastitis. The prevalence of Candida albicans has increased from 1% in 1971 to 17.0% in November 2002. Conversely, despite some fluctuations, the prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, E. coli and K. pneumoniae remain above 10%. The possible risk factors for these observations are discussed.
TI  - Evaluation of a new chromogenic medium for isolation and identification of common urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - In the study presented here, a new chromogenic medium (CPS ID 3; bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) was compared to routine media for the isolation, identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacteria recovered from urine specimens, and a cost analysis was performed. Escherichia coli, Proteeae tribe, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. and Streptococcus agalactiae grew on the chromogenic medium as typical differentiated colonies and were accurately identified even in mixed cultures. Although the similarity of colors produced by isolates belonging to the Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia and Citrobacter (KESC) group prevents differentiation among them, members of KESC were easily identified as coliforms. No substantial difference was observed when comparing the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing performed on colonies selected from reference media versus CPS ID 3. Use of the new medium was associated with a savings of 75% over the conventional methods and the API system. Furthermore, this medium facilitated a remarkable reduction in the laboratory workload and consequently resulted in additional time and cost savings.
TI  - The group B streptococcal sialic acid O-acetyltransferase is encoded by neuD, a conserved component of bacterial sialic acid biosynthetic gene clusters.
AB  - Nearly two dozen microbial pathogens have surface polysaccharides or lipo-oligosaccharides that contain sialic acid (Sia), and several Sia-dependent virulence mechanisms are known to enhance bacterial survival or result in host tissue injury. Some pathogens are also known to O-acetylate their Sias, although the role of this modification in pathogenesis remains unclear. We report that neuD, a gene located within the Group B Streptococcus (GBS) Sia biosynthetic gene cluster, encodes a Sia O-acetyltransferase that is itself required for capsular polysaccharide (CPS) sialylation. Homology modeling and site-directed mutagenesis identified Lys-123 as a critical residue for Sia O-acetyltransferase activity. Moreover, a single nucleotide polymorphism in neuD can determine whether GBS displays a "high" or "low" Sia O-acetylation phenotype. Complementation analysis revealed that Escherichia coli K1 NeuD also functions as a Sia O-acetyltransferase in GBS. In fact, NeuD homologs are commonly found within Sia biosynthetic gene clusters. A bioinformatic approach identified 18 bacterial species with a Sia biosynthetic gene cluster that included neuD. Included in this list are the sialylated human pathogens Legionella pneumophila, Vibrio parahemeolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Campylobacter jejuni, as well as an additional 12 bacterial species never before analyzed for Sia expression. Phylogenetic analysis shows that NeuD homologs of sialylated pathogens share a common evolutionary lineage distinct from the poly-Sia O-acetyltransferase of E. coli K1. These studies define a molecular genetic approach for the selective elimination of GBS Sia O-acetylation without concurrent loss of sialylation, a key to further studies addressing the role(s) of this modification in bacterial virulence.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in outpatient urinary isolates: final results from the North American Urinary Tract Infection Collaborative Alliance (NAUTICA).
AB  - The goal of the North American Urinary Tract Infection Collaborative Alliance (NAUTICA) study was to determine antibiotic susceptibility to commonly used agents for urinary tract infections against outpatient urinary isolates obtained in various geographic regions in the USA and Canada. Forty-one medical centres (30 from the USA and 11 from Canada) participated, with each centre submitting up to 50 consecutive outpatient midstream urine isolates. Isolates were identified to species level by the standard protocol of each laboratory. Susceptibility testing was determined using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) microdilution method. Resistance breakpoints used were those published by the NCCLS, including: ampicillin (resistant > or = 32 microg/mL), sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) (resistant > or = 4 microg/mL), nitrofurantoin (resistant > or = 128 microg/mL), ciprofloxacin (resistant > or = 4 microg/mL) and levofloxacin (resistant > or = 8 microg/mL). Of the 1990 isolates collected, 75.1% (1494) were collected from the USA and 24.9% (496) were collected from Canada. The mean age of the patients was 48.3 years (range 1 month to 99 years), and 79.5% and 20.5% of isolates were obtained from women and men, respectively. The most common organisms were Escherichia coli (57.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.4%), Enterococcus spp. (6.6%), Proteus mirabilis (5.4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9%), Citrobacter spp. (2.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (2.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (1.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (1.3%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (1.2%), Klebsiella spp. (1.2%), Enterobacter aerogenes (1.1%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (1.0%). Among all 1990 isolates, 45.9% were resistant to ampicillin, 20.4% to SMX/TMP, 14.3% to nitrofurantoin, 9.7% to ciprofloxacin and 8.1% to levofloxacin. Fluoroquinolone resistance was highest in patients > or = 65 years of age. For the 1142 E. coli isolates, resistance rates were: ampicillin 37.7%, SMX/TMP 21.3%, ciprofloxacin 5.5%, levofloxacin 5.1% and nitrofurantoin 1.1%. For all 1990 isolates and for the 1142 E. coli only, resistance rates were significantly higher in US compared with Canadian medical centres. This study reports higher rates of antibiotic resistance in US versus Canadian outpatient urinary isolates and demonstrates the continuing evolution of resistance to antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Spectrum and antibiotic resistance of uropathogens isolated from hospital and community patients with urinary tract infections in two large hospitals in Kuwait.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the spectrum of microbial etiology and antibiotic resistance pattern of the uropathogens that cause urinary tract infections in 2 large teaching hospitals in Kuwait over a period of 1 year. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Vitek identification card system was used to identify the uropathogens. Susceptibility of the isolates against 18 antibiotics was performed by the microbroth dilution method using the Vitek automated system. In addition, gram-positive bacteria were tested in parallel by the disk diffusion technique. RESULTS: The six overall most common isolates were: Escherichia coli, accounting for 47% of isolates in both hospitals, followed by Candida spp. (10.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.6%), Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS; 9.5%), Enterococcus faecalis (4.2%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.1%). Amikacin provided the widest coverage amongst all the antibiotics tested followed by ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and piperacillin-tazobactam. For the gram-negatives, high resistance (26-63%) to the beta-lactam antibiotics was noted, especially to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cephalothin and cefuroxime. Resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was also high. None of the enterococci was resistant to the glycopeptides, but 38-60% of the Staphylococcus haemolyticus were resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin. CONCLUSION: These data show the high level of antimicrobial resistance amongst the uropathogens causing urinary tract infection in the two hospitals studied.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against 6792 Gram-negative and Gram-positive clinical isolates from the global Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST Program, 2004).
AB  - Tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antibiotic, has shown promising in vitro activity against many common pathogens, including multidrug-resistant strains. To determine the activity of tigecycline against a broad range of pathogens from diverse populations and geographic areas, the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST Program) commenced in 2003. This study evaluated the activity of tigecycline and commonly used antimicrobials against 6792 clinical isolates from 40 study centers in 11 countries. Tigecycline was the most active agent tested against Gram-positive facultative species including multidrug-resistant strains. MIC90 results (microg/mL) for tigecycline against Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.12, 0.12, 0.25, and 0.25 microg/mL, respectively. Tigecycline was active against Enterobacteriaceae with an MIC90 of 1 microg/mL. Haemophilus influenzae was very susceptible to tigecycline with an MIC90 of only 0.25 microg/mL. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the least susceptible organism tested against tigecycline. Tigecycline appears to be a promising new glycylcycline agent for the treatment of many types of pathogens with varying resistance phenotypes.
TI  - Clinical effect of intravenous ciprofloxacin on hospital-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - The effect of intravenous ciprofloxacin (CPFX) on hospital-acquired pneumonia was examined. The subjects were 32 patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia classified as being in group I, group II, and group III, based on The Japanese Respiratory Society Guidelines for management of hospital-acquired pneumonia. None of the patients had received antibiotic treatment for the pneumonia. CPFX 300 mg was intravenously infused twice daily for 3-14 days, and its clinical effect, bacterological effect, and side effects were examined. Intravenous CPEX was clinically effective in 21 of the 32 patients, with an efficacy rate of 65.6%. With regard to bacteriological efficacy, 4 of 5 strains of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 2 of 3 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 of 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 of 2 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 1 of 2 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 of 2 strains of Serratia marcescens, and the 1 strain of Klebsiella oxytoca were eradicated, with an eradication rate of 42.3% (11 of 26 strains whose fate was confirmed eradicated). Abnormal laboratory findings (side effects) were observed in 11 of the 32 patients (34.4%), but all side effects were mild. Based on the above data, intravenous CPFX may be the drug which should be recommended as the first choice for hospital-acquired pneumonia.
TI  - Screening of lactic-acid bacteria from South African barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain ST11BR), L. pentosus  (strain ST151BR), L. plantarum (strain ST13BR), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain ST34BR) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the Western, Northern and Eastern provinces of South Africa. The peptides (bacST11BR, bacST151BR, bacST13BR and bacST34BR) lost their activity after treatment with proteinase K, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. The peptides inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus casei, L. sakei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Enterobacter cloacae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, L. salivarius, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. caprinus and S. pneumoniae. Peptides bacST11BR and bacST13BR differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill Klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the E. coli strains. Peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees C. When autoclaved (121 degrees C, 20 min), only bacST13BR lost its activity. The bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C.
TI  - The role of unusual pathogens in prostatitis syndrome.
AB  - A total of 1442 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis were examined over  a 4-year period at the Outpatient Department for Urogenital Infections, University Hospital for Infectious Diseases "Dr. Fran Mihaljevic", Zagreb, Croatia. An infectious aetiology was determined in 1070 (74.2%) patients. In 561 of 1070 (52.4%) patients the inflammatory finding (>10 WBC/hpf) was found in expressed prostatic secretions (EPS) or voided bladder urine (VB(3)). Normal, <10 WBCs/hpf was found in 362 of 536 (67.5%) patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis in whom Chlamydia trachomatis was detected in EPS or VB(3), in 51 of 151 (33.8%) patients with isolated Trichomonas vaginalis and in 40 of 72 (55.6%) patients with isolated Ureaplasma urealyticum. Escherichia coli was the causative pathogen in 95, Enterococcus in 68, Proteus mirabilis in 37, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 16, Streptococcus agalactiae in 19, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 3 patients with chronic prostatitis. Other patients had a mixed infection. In patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP) caused by E. coli, P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae, E. or S. agalactiae, an inflammatory finding was regularly found in EPS or VB(3).
TI  - Relationship between oral motor dysfunction and oral bacteria in bedridden elderly.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between oral bacterial colonization and oral motor dysfunction. STUDY DESIGN: Oral motor dysfunction (swallowing and speech disorders) and detection of oral bacterial species from dental plaque in 55 elderly persons who had remained hospitalized for more than 3 months were investigated and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The detection rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were significantly higher in subjects with than in those without a swallowing disorder. A similar result was found with regard to the presence of a speech disorder. About half of subjects who had oral motor dysfunction and hypoalbuminemia had colonization by MRSA and/or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the combination of oral motor dysfunction and hypoalbminemia elevated the risk of opportunistic microorganisms colonization in the oral cavity of elderly patients hospitalized over the long term.
TI  - Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry for glycoscreening in biomedical research.
AB  - Application of capillary electrophoresis (CE) in combination with mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem MS to glycoscreening in biomedical projects is highlighted. In the first part recent CE-MS experiments by sheath liquid CE and multiple stage MS are reported. Neutral and negatively charged N-glycan mixtures from ribonuclease B and fetuin, high-mannose type N-glycoforms, oligosaccharides from lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of Haemophilus influenzae, polysaccharides of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were analyzed. A particular emphasis is devoted to the applicability of novel off- and on-line CE-MS and tandem MS methods for screening of proteoglycan-derived oligosaccharides, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as hyaluronates from Streptococcus agalactiae, chondroitin/dermatan sulfates (CS/DS) from bovine aorta and human skin fibroblast decorin, and heparin/heparan sulfate (HS) from porcine and bovine mucosa. The performance of CE-MS/MS for identification of glycoforms in glycopeptides and glycoproteins is illustrated by experiments performed on complex mixtures from urine of patients suffering from a hereditary N-acetylhexosaminidase deficiency (Schindler's disease) and urine of patients suffering from cancer cachexia. For determination of glycosylation patterns in glycoproteins like enzymes and antibodies by CE/MS, both CE-matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and CE-electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS were functional. Finally, the potential of CE-ESI-MS strategy in glycolipid analysis is demonstrated for gangliosides from bovine brain for which particular CE buffer conditions are required.

AB  - We developed real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for rapid detection of the most common and clinically relevant bacteria in positive blood culture bottles, including Staphylococcus spp., S. epidermidis, S. aureus, Enterococcus spp. (including differentiation of E. faecalis and E. faecium), Streptococcus spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter spp., Bacteroides spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. A total of 507 positive blood cultures were investigated according to a specific PCR algorithm based on the microscopic result of the blood culture, and the PCR results were compared to the culture results. Apart from-cross reactions between E. coli and Chryseomonas luteola and Enterococcus faecium and E. durans, the PCR assay correctly identified all bacteria in the blood cultures and did not show any false-positive results. Regarding blood cultures positive with a single species of bacteria (n = 474), 98.3% of all bacteria were correctly detected by the PCR algorithm within a few hours. However, in mixed infections, the sensitivity was lower. The PCR algorithm is well suited for rapid identification of the most common bacteria in positive blood cultures.
TI  - Neonatal bacterial septicaemia at the Mount Hope Women's Hospital, Trinidad.
AB  - This retrospective study to determine the incidence of bacterial septicaemia in neonates at the Mount Hope Women's Hospital, Trinidad during a 2-year period, 1996 to 1997, included all neonates whose blood or cerebrospinal fluid cultured positive for bacteria. There were 9866 live births (LB), 102 of whom were diagnosed with bacterial sepsis, an incidence of 10/1000 LB. Thirty-one neonates had a positive culture for group B Streptococcus, an incidence of 3/1000 LB. Gram-negative organisms accounted for 63% of positive cultures. There were three outbreaks of nosocomial infection, two caused by Enterobacter spp with mortality rates of 37% and 50% and one outbreak caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a mortality rate of 25%. The overall mortality rate was 27% (27/102), 63% were boys and 58% were preterm. The incidence of neonatal bacterial sepsis of 10/1000 LB is the highest recorded for the Caribbean and indicates that infection might be an important cause of the high perinatal mortality rate.
TI  - Comparison of the microbicidal and muramidase activities of mouse lysozyme M and  P.
AB  - Lysozyme is one of the most abundant antimicrobial proteins in the airspaces of the lung. Mice express two lysozyme genes, lysozyme M and P, but only the M enzyme is detected in abundance in lung tissues. Disruption of the lysozyme M locus significantly increased bacterial burden and mortality following intratracheal infection with a Gram-negative bacterium. Unexpectedly, significant lysozyme enzyme activity (muramidase activity) was detected in the airspaces of uninfected lysozyme M-/- mice, amounting to 25% of the activity in wild-type mice. Muramidase activity in lysozyme M-/- mice was associated with increased lysozyme P mRNA and protein in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid respectively. The muramidase activity of recombinant lysozyme P was less than that of recombinant M lysozyme. Recombinant P lysozyme was also less effective in killing selected Gram-negative bacteria, requiring higher concentrations than lysozyme M to achieve the same level of killing. The lower antimicrobial activity of P lysozyme, coupled with incomplete compensation by P lysozyme in lysozyme M-/- mice, probably accounts for the increased susceptibility of null mice to infection. Recombinant lysozyme M and P were equally effective in killing selected Gram-positive organisms. This outcome suggests that disruption of both M and P loci would significantly increase susceptibility to airway infections, particularly those associated with colonization by Gram-positive organisms.
TI  - [Antimicrobial action of ammonium salts of fused heterocycles containing ortho-nitrogen].
AB  - By alkylation of hexamethylenetetramine with halogenated derivatives of ketones,  ethers, esters or amides of acids, alkyl- and aralkyl halides the corresponding N-monoalkylated compounds of hexamethylenetetramine were obtained. The quaternization of pyridine nitrogen in 5,6-benzoquinoline, 8-hydroxyquinoline, quinoline, 1,10-phenanthroline molecules with alkyl- or aralkylhalides was carried out. The susceptibility of Gram-positive (Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (E. coli, Salmonella cholerae suis, Salmonella enteridis Gartneri) microorganisms to synthesized quaternary ammonium salts by disc difussion method has been detected. The bacteriostatic action of 0.5-1% solutions of all compounds was assessed in comparison with benzalkonium chloride. It was shown, that the most effectiveness against all strains is possessed by quaternary hexamethylenetetramine ammonium salts, and especially salts, containing 1-propynyl- or hydroxycarbamoylmethyl radicals. The action of these two compounds against Salmonella and Streptococcus was stronger than the action of benzalkonium chloride. Susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to these compounds were detected. It was shown, that 1% solutions of chlorides of N-(1-propynyl) hexamethylenetetramonium and N-(hydroxycarbamoylmethyl) hexamethylenetetrammonium demonstrate the same bacteriostatic action against P. aeruginosa as well as benzalkonium chloride.
TI  - Epidemiology and antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria causing skin and soft tissue infections in the USA and Europe: a guide to appropriate antimicrobial therapy.
AB  - Susceptibility data for all organisms associated with a range of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) in hospitalised patients were studied. Data were reported by clinical laboratories in the USA, France, Germany, Italy and Spain during 2001 which participate in The Surveillance Network (TSN). Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp. and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most prevalent pathogens in all countries. MRSA was detected in 44.4, 34.7, 12.4, 41.8 and 32. 4% of S. aureus in each country, respectively. The majority of MRSA were cross resistant to other compound classes tested except for vancomycin (100% susceptible) trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole with range 1.7% (France) to 15.9% (Italy) resistant, and gentamicin with range 12.2% (France) to 87.0% (Italy) resistant. More than 99.0% of MSSA tested susceptible to ceftriaxone and >94.9% to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. 87.2% (France) to 94.6% of MSSA (Germany) were ciprofloxacin susceptible; 73.2% (USA) to 86.6% (Spain) were erythromycin susceptible; 85.4% (Italy) to 99.2% (France) were gentamicin susceptible. MSSA were more frequently found and generally more antibiotic susceptible from out patients. Overall, 100% of Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes were susceptible to penicillin, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. Macrolide resistance was common among S. agalactiae (20.7%, Germany to 10%, Italy and Spain), S. pyogenes (19.2%, France to 11.1%, USA) and viridans streptococci (25.7%, France to 14.1%, Germany). Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. were uncommon outside the USA (17.5%) and Italy (7.4%). For all countries susceptibility of E. coli was 100% to imipenem, >98.7% to amikacin, >96.0% to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. Susceptibility of E. coli isolates to ciprofloxacin was 77.6% in Spain to 94.3% in Germany. Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., Citrobacter spp. and Enterobacter spp. displayed varying susceptibilities between countries to drugs tested. Putative extended spectrum beta-lactamase expression in E. coli remained rare comprising 4-5% of isolates in USA, Italy and Spain and in France and Germany <2%. For P. aeruginosa piperacillin-tazobactam, amikacin, imipenem and ceftazidime were the most active compounds tested irrespective of region. Surveillance data should be considered when selecting empirical therapy for treating SSTI.
TI  - Comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent North American clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the US and Canada between 1997 and 1999. Based upon Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many Gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. Against Enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general, displayed weak activity with only Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of Gram-negative non-Enterobacteriaceae including Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against Burkholderia cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.
TI  - In vitro activity of ertapenem against common clinical isolates in relation to human pharmacokinetics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ertapenem against bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with moderate to severe complicated intra-abdominal, complicated skin/skin structure, acute pelvic, or complicated urinary tract infection or community acquired pneumonia was compared to ceftriaxone and piperacillin-tazobactam and related to known plasma concentrations of the three agents. Ertapenem was more potent against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) than ceftriaxone and piperacillin-tazobactam and was more potent and more active than both of these agents against Enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes. Piperacillin-tazobactam was the most active agent against enterococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (n=1088), Streptococcus pyogenes (n=37), Streptococcus agalactiae (n=48), MSSA (n=187), Haemophilus influenzae (n=59), and Moraxella catarrhalis (n=9) were susceptible to ertapenem; < 1% of 1284 anaerobes and only 1 of 113 Streptococcus pneumoniae (a penicillin-resistant isolate) were resistant to ertapenem. The MIC value at which 90% of all Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci, MSSA, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and anaerobes were inhibited (MIC90) was < or = 1 microg/ml and below the mean plasma concentration of total ertapenem following a 1 g intravenous infusion for at least 24 hours, i.e., the entire recommended dosing interval, and below the free drug concentration for at least 8 h.
TI  - [Use of MPO chromogenic culture medium for routine processing of urine cultures].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The chromogenic culture medium, MPO, was compared to culture on CLED  (cystein, lactose, electrolyte-deficient) agar for the detection, enumeration and identification of urinary tract pathogens. METHODS: A total of 1,080 clinical urine specimens were assessed. All samples were inoculated in MPO and CLED using the calibrated loop method. RESULTS: Among 145 positive urine samples, 171 strains of bacteria were isolated (111 Escherichia coli, 26 Enterococcus spp., 12 Proteus spp., 10 Enterobacteriaceae from the Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Serratia group, 5 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 Streptococcus agalactiae, 3 Staphylococcus spp. and 4 Candida albicans. For all samples, enumeration of microorganisms was comparable with the two media studied. Identification was also similar, except for 6 cases in which Enterococcus spp. were only detected with the chromogenic medium. CONCLUSIONS: Overall urine culture results with MPO chromogenic medium were similar to those obtained with CLED, making it a feasible alternative to the standard medium. Moreover, use of a chromogenic technique implies a significant reduction in workload, since additional tests to identify the microorganisms isolated are not needed in most cases.
TI  - Vaginal microbiota in healthy pregnant women and prenatal screening of group B streptococci (GBS).
AB  - The microbiota of the lower female genital tract was evaluated from vaginal swabs obtained from 623 healthy pregnant women at gestation periods of 35-40 weeks. Isolated and identified microorganisms were expressed as percentages of total samples. As expected, lactobacilli made up the dominant vaginal microbiota (70%). Enterobacteriaceae, mainly Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus, were present in 38% of the samples, which might reflect the possible contamination of vaginal tract with rectal microorganisms. Candida albicans was present in 10% of healthy pregnant woman assayed. Streptoccocci (Streptococcus sp. and Enterococcus faecalis with 3% and 4%, respectively) and other gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus sp., 5%), along with other microorgansisms such as Gardnerella vaginalis (5%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2%) may represent a potential infection risk. Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococci beta-hemolytic, GBS) was detected in 7% of the samples. GBS infection is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality in the developed world. Furthermore, GBS was often co-isolated with C. albicans (54.5%) in the samples. A complete and detailed evaluation of the vaginal biota swab, with particular attention to the presence of potential pathogens such as GBS, is a preventive strategy that can provide useful information to obstetricians and gynecologist in managing the last days of pregnancy and delivery.
TI  - Isolation of S-n-butylcysteine sulfoxide and six n-butyl-containing thiosulfinates from Allium siculum.
AB  - Isolation and identification of (S(S)R(C))-S-n-butylcysteine sulfoxide (1) from the bulbs of Allium siculum is reported. This compound was found in all parts of the plant (bulbs, stem, leaves, and flowers) along with known compounds (S(S)R(C))-S-methyl- and (R(S)R(C))-(E)-S-(1-propenyl)cysteine sulfoxides (2 and 3, respectively). In addition, six n-butyl-containing thiosulfinates (4-9) have been found in a CH2Cl2 extract of the bulbs. Structures were determined by a combination of spectral methods (primarily NMR and MS) and by comparison with authentic compounds obtained by synthesis. Antimicrobial activities of 4-7 and 9 are reported.
TI  - Trends in antibacterial susceptibility of mastitis pathogens during a seven-year  period.
AB  - Milk samples collected from dairy cattle suspected of having mastitis were submitted to the Microbiology Laboratory of the Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory, Michigan State University, for bacteriologic culture. A total of 2778 isolates, from the years 1994 to 2000, were isolated, identified, and subjected to in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing using the disk diffusion method, in accordance with National Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) standards. Isolates included in this study were Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcesens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The proportion of bacterial isolates determined to be susceptible did not change during the 7-yr period for the majority of bacterial-antibacterial interactions tested. However, analysis for linear trend in proportions determined that there were increases in the proportion of S. aureus isolates that were susceptible to ampicillin, penicillin, and erythromycin. For Strep. uberis, increases in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred for oxacillin, sulfa-trimethoprim, gentamicin, and pirlimycin, and a decrease in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred with penicillin. For Strep. dysgalactiae, increases in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred with erythromycin, gentamicin, sulfa-trimethoprim, and tetracycline. For Strep. agalactiae, increases in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred with sulfa-trimethoprim. Among E. coli isolates, there was an increase in the proportion that were susceptible to ampicillin and cephalothin. Among K pneumoniae isolates, there was an increase in the proportion that were susceptible to ceftiofur. Overall, there was no indication of increased resistance of mastitis isolates to antibacterials that are commonly used in dairy cattle.
TI  - Biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  - The Calgary Biofilm Device (CBD) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin G, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. Bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the CBD under selected conditions. The biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. Biofilms composed of Arcanobacterium (Actinomyces) pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hyicus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium renale, or Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. Biofilm and planktonic Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. Planktonic Escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. Enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against E. coli growing as a biofilm. Salmonella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. Planktonic and biofilm Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. The CBD provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.
TI  - An in vitro study of antibacterial properties of the cervical mucus plug in pregnancy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether cervical mucus plugs are antibacterial in vitro. STUDY DESIGN: Cervical mucus plugs from 56 healthy women in labor were studied by 2 different antimicrobial assays: (1) analysis of the inhibition by the cervical mucus plug of several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by overlaying the cervical mucus plug onto an agar plate with imbedded bacteria, and (2) determination of the antibacterial property of the cervical mucus plug material by radial diffusion assay with group B Streptococcus and Escherichia coli. RESULTS: In the agar overlay assay, there was complete inhibition of clinical isolates of Staphylococcus saprophyticus, E coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and patient-variable partial-to-complete inhibition of Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae. In the radial diffusion assay, cervical mucus plugs had activity toward group B Streptococcus equivalent to 0.075 microg/mL of gentamicin and toward E coli equivalent to 0.5 microg/mL of gentamicin. CONCLUSION: A low-molecular substance with antibacterial activity in the cervical mucus plug may protect the fetus against ascending infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of human amnion and chorion in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to explore the direct effects of  amnion and chorion on bacterial growth in vitro including the antibacterial spectrum. Chorioamniotic membranes were obtained under sterile conditions from 13 healthy women undergoing elective cesarean section at term. Likewise, chorioamniotic membranes were obtained from 10 healthy women with spontaneous vaginal delivery at term. Five strains of Hemolytic streptococci group B (GBS) were tested and one clinical isolate of the following species or bacterial groups: Hemolytic streptococcus group A, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Lactobacillus species. Bacteriological media included (1) blood-agar medium; (2) a transparent agar medium for submerged cultures; and (3) a nutrient broth medium. RESULTS: An inhibitory effect of fetal membranes against a range of bacteria was found. Consistent results were obtained in experiments with cultures on agar and cultures suspended in agar (membranes from eight women in both studies). In experiments with liquid cultures (seven women) only chorion showed a marginal inhibitory effect. All strains were inhibited, but the most pronounced inhibition was obtained for streptococcus group A, S. aureus and S. saprophyticus by both chorion and amnion. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated an inhibitory effect of the fetal membranes on a diverse panel of bacteria
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of piperacillin in several fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - We investigated activity of piperacillin (PIPC) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. The following results were obtained: 1. PIPC had its MIC90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in Gram-positive bacteria (Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis) and showed its MIC of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible PRSP strains out of 38 isolates of S. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. PIPC showed favorable antibacterial activities as its MIC90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae), except for P. mirabilis in which its MIC90 was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of P. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as PIPC, ABPC, CTM and CZOP. 3. PIPC had its MIC90 of > 128 micrograms/ml in Bacteroides fragilis. From these results, PIPC was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when 20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the USA.
AB  - The antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 Gram-positive and 995 Gram-negative organisms collected from various USA sites. Time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0. 016 mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/L), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/L), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.03 mg/L), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/L), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/L). Against Gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. MIC(90)s for gemifloxacin were: Haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/L), Escherichia coli (0.016 mg/L), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/L), Enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/L), Proteus spp. (4 mg/L), Serratia spp. (1 mg/L), Citrobacter freundii (2 mg/L), Morganella morganii (0.12 mg/L), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/L), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/L). Gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x MIC. The PAE for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at 2 and 4 x MIC, although longer PAEs were observed with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x MIC) and shorter PAEs with E. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and K. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). In conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. It has substantially improved potency against Gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. It retains the good Gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged PAEs.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin against 4151 Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms.
AB  - Gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin are fluoroquinolones  with enhanced Gram-positive activity while retaining broad-spectrum activity against Gram-negative pathogens. Levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin are older quinolones with broad activity against Gram-negative pathogens and borderline activity against some Gram-positive organisms. We compared the in vitro activity of these compounds against 4151 Gram-negative and -positive organisms. Gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin were highly active against penicillin sensitive and resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae. Ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were active but less potent. All compounds were highly active (overall) against Gram-negative pathogens with ciprofloxacin being the most active agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our data indicate that the advanced fluoroquinolones will be important compounds for treating infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of biapenem in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - Biapenem is a new injectable carbapenem antibiotic which has favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and is stable to hydrolysis by dehydropeptidase I. Biapenem inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Peptostreptococcus magnus, Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella bivia at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. The MIC(90) of biapenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was lower than that of panipenem, equivalent to that of imipenem, and greater than that of meropenem. The in vivo efficacy of biapenem was evaluated using the experimental infection model of uterine endometritis. The accumulation of neutrophils in the uterus in the biapenem- treated group was less marked than in the nontreated group, as well as bacteriological response. These results suggest that the new antimicrobial agent biapenem might be useful for the treatment of polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
TI  - Altered surfactant protein B levels in transgenic mice do not affect clearance of bacteria from the lungs.
AB  - To determine the role of surfactant protein B (SP-B) in bacterial clearance from  the airways, three groups of mice expressing different levels of SP-B were studied: wild-type mice, hemizygous SP-B mice, and SP-B overexpressing transgenic mice. SP-B levels in overexpressing mice were increased 5-fold relative to hemizygous mice and 2- to 3-fold over wild-type littermates. Mice from each group were infected intratracheally with the common airway pathogens, group B streptococci or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There was no significant difference in the number of recoverable viable bacteria at 6 h (group B streptococci and P. aeruginosa) and at 24 h (P. aeruginosa) among the three groups. Similarly, systemic dissemination of bacteria was not different among the three groups for both pathogens and at both time points. We conclude that SP-B levels in vivo do not influence clearance of bacteria from the lungs.
TI  - Risk factors associated with early-onset sepsis in premature infants.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define perinatal factors associated with early-onset neonatal sepsis. STUDY DESIGN: Maternal and neonatal variables were analysed retrospectively in 343 infants born before 35 weeks using univariate and multivariate statistical analysis. RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis identified risk factors for probable neonatal sepsis: gestational age at delivery (odds ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91-0.96), premature rupture of the membranes (odds ratio 2.9, 95% CI 1.004-8.56), Apgar score after 1 min (odds ratio 0.7, 95% CI 0.53-0.96), and histological chorioamnionitis and/or funisitis (odds ratio 4.1, 95% CI 1.36-12.12). There was a strong association between probable sepsis and intracranial haemorrhage of the infant (odds ratio 4.3, 95% CI 1.07-17.40). Funisitis had a high specificity (91%) and positive predictive value (82%) for the detection of neonatal sepsis < or =32 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Independent obstetrical risk factors for early-onset neonatal sepsis in premature infants may help to identify newborns who benefit from maternal antibiotic prophylaxis before birth. The histological examination of the umbilical cord can be used as an additional diagnostic test to detect newborns at risk of infection.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (CFDN) and cefditoren (CDTR). FK041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK041 was active against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms except Enterococcus faecalis with MIC90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. FK041 was more active than CFDN and CDTR against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to CFDN and CDTR against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. FK041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae with an MIC range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to CFDN but inferior to CDTR. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, FK041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of CFDN and CDTR. However, it was inferior to CDTR in activity against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Morganella morganii, and Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With FK041 a small difference between MIC and MBC against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. FK041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. The stability of FK041 to these enzymes was similar to those of CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of S. aureus (PBP 3, 2, and 1) and E. coli (PBP 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
TI  - Susceptibility to levofloxacin of clinical isolates of bacteria from intensive care and haematology/oncology patients in Switzerland: a multicentre study.
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the susceptibility of clinical isolates to levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone with extended activity against Gram-positive bacteria, and other antibiotics in 12 Swiss clinical microbiology laboratories using the NCCLS disc diffusion technique. Isolates were prospectively collected from intensive care units (ICUs (59%), oncology wards (7%) and other units with haematology/oncology patients (34%) from June 1995 to March 1996. The levofloxacin breakpoints used were as recommended by the manufacturer. A total of 310 Gram-positive and 580 Gram-negative isolates from the respiratory tract (36%), skin/wounds (12%), blood (16%), urine (17%) and other sources (19%) were tested. The percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin was 100% for Enterococcus spp. (38 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (13), Streptococcus pneumoniae (65), Acinetobacter spp. (11), Citrobacter diversus (6), Citrobacter freundii (17), Klebsiella oxytoca (39), Morganella morganii (16), Proteus mirabilis (20), Proteus vulgaris (23), Serratia spp. (19), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (10) and Haemophilus influenzae (41). The percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin for Staphylococcus aureus (95 strains, including 2% MRSA) was 94%, coagulase-negative staphylococci (85) 65%, Enterobacter spp. (75) 99%, Escherichia coli (111) 97%, Klebsiella pneumoniae (45) 98% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (124) 87%. In conclusion, levofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone to which the most common clinical isolates in Switzerland are susceptible. The susceptibility of Enterococcus spp. and S. pneumoniae to levofloxacin was particularly remarkable. This compound appears to be a promising therapeutic alternative for the treatment of Gram-positive infections.
TI  - In vitro activities of pazufloxacin, a novel injectable quinolone, against bacteria causing infections in obstetric and gynecological patients.
AB  - T-3762 is an injectable new quinolone with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. Pazufloxacin (T-3761) is an active form of T-3762. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of pazufloxacin for 50% of the clinical isolates tested were 3.13 microg/ml for Streptococcus agalactiae, 6.25 microg/ml for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.025 microg/ml for Escherichia coli, 0.78 microg/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 6.25 microg/ml for Peptostreptococcus magnus, 6.25 microg/ml for Bacteroides fragilis and 12.5 microg/ml for Prevotella bivia. The MICs of T-3762 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 3.13 microg/ml for S. agalactiae, 6.25 microg/ml for G. vaginalis, 0.10 microg/ml for E. coli, 12.5 microg/ml for P. aeruginosa, 25 microg/ml for P. magnus, 12.5 microg/ml for B. fragilis and 25 microg/ml for P. bivia. The results of this study suggest that, subject to confirmation by clinical trials, T-3762, in combination with an agent with reliable activity against anaerobic bacteria, is suitable as an empirical therapy of patients with obstetric and gynecological infections.
TI  - Lipid peroxidation of lung surfactant by bacteria.
AB  - The epithelium of the lung is lined with extracellular pulmonary surfactant. This is the surface that invading bacteria first come into contact with when they enter the alveoli. As bacteria become established and interact with this layer, various characteristics of surfactant may become altered. We studied free radical production by three bacterial species, group B streptococci, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as the effect of two concentrations of lung surfactant (Curosurf at 0.04 and 0.4 mg/ml) on this production estimated by the nitro blue tetrazolium reduction test. We also measured the lipid peroxidation of surfactant at various incubation times (0-20 h), using a LPO-586 test kit. In addition, the effect of vitamin E as an antioxidant in a concentration of 0.5 microM was determined by the lipid peroxidation test. We found that the nitro blue tetrazolium reduction by the three bacterial species and lipid peroxidation of lung surfactant increased with time. Vitamin E reduced the lipid peroxidation of this surfactant. By measuring bacterial growth at various incubation times we showed that lung surfactant was bactericidal to group B streptococcal and E. coli strains and that P. aeruginosa strains were resistant to surfactant. We conclude that bacteria, probably by their production of reactive oxygen species, cause lipid peroxidation of lung surfactant.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the urine of children with urinary tract infections from 1986 to 1995].
AB  - In adults and in children urinary system infections are mostly caused by gram-negative and rarely by gram-positive bacteria. Of gram-negative bacteria the most frequent cause of infections are Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Serratia etc., and of gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus agalactiae. In rare cases the cause of infection may also be Pneumococcus and Haemophilus influenzae. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the study was to investigate the sensitivity to antibiotics of gram-negative bacteria as the predominant cause of urinary infections. METHOD OF THE STUDY: We isolated 20,615 bacterium species from urine of children hospitalized or treated as outpatients at the University Children's Hospital in Belgrade. Urine was collected classically, i.e. by taking the second clean stream into a sterile test tube or by Uricult test. The samples were cultured on blood plates and endo-agar. Identification was done by standard bacteriologic methods and when findings were dubious API-20E (bioMerieux) was used. Bacterium sensitivity to nine antibiotics (ampicillin, cephalexin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, amikacin, co-trimoxazole, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin) was assessed with disc diffuse method on Muller-Hinton agars. RESULTS: Based on the obtained results, Escherichia coli species sensitivity to amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin ranged from 90 to 100%; sensitivity to co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol ranged from 70 to 80%, to cephalexin from 50 to 60%, while to ampicillin it was only 20%. Klebsiella species sensitivity to nalidixic acid and cefotaxime was 70-85%; to amikacin, cefotaxime, co-trimoxazole and gentamicin 60-80%; to cephalexin and chloramphenicol 40-50%, and to ampicillin only 5-15%. Proteus species showed sensitivity to amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime and nalidixic acid of 90-95%; to co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol 70-80%; to cephalexin and ampicillin 40-50%, and to nitrofurantoin 10%. Pseudomonas aeruginosa species showed the highest level of sensitivity to amikacin (40-50%), and somewhat lower to gentamicin (10-40%), and a very low sensitivity to other antimicrobial drugs (10-25%). DISCUSSION: It may be noted from the above data that gram-negative bacteria are the cause of urinary infections in about 90% of cases, while gram-positive bacteria are the cause in only 10%, which is in accordance with data from literature. Of all antibiotic drugs ampicillin (a wide spectrum penicillin) had a very significant role in the therapy of urinary infections. However, the long-term usage of ampicillin led to increased resistance to the drug in infections caused by Escherichia coli. Natural resistance to ampicillin of Klebsiella species limited its usage when penicillin was first introduced. Proteus mirabilis species, especially those isolate in primary infection, are often sensitive to amino penicillin. Contrary to Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus and Providentie species show a high resistance to these antibiotics. Due to the crisis in our country and the lack of other antibiotics, ampicillin was widely used. The wide use of the drug caused evident resistance of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis to this antibiotic. A fall in the sensitivity of Klebsiella to cephalexin, gentamicin, amikacin and co-timoxazole, which occurred in 1992, has been explained by intrahospital circulation of multiresistant Klebsiella species. The sensitivity of isolated gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most prominent to aminoglycosides (amikacin and gentamicin). The most frequent mechanism of enterobacterial resistance to trimethoprim and co-trimoxazole involves dihydrofolate reductase enzyme. Comparative studies related to the administration of co-trimoxazole have shown that the difference in the efficacy between thes
TI  - Effect of therapeutic concentrations of nitric oxide on bacterial growth in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Besides its vasodilative actions, nitric oxide (NO) is also involved  in host defense on a cellular level. We studied the antimicrobial properties of NO in concentrations used with inhaled NO therapy for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in neonates. DESIGN: In vitro study of bacterial growth of five species, with and without NO exposure. SETTING: Level IV neonatal intensive care unit at a university children's hospital. SUBJECTS: In vitro bacterial cultures. INTERVENTIONS: We tested ten different strains of five bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, group B streptococcus [GBS/Streptococcus agalactiae], Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), derived from the tracheal isolates of ventilated premature and term infants. Cultures were exposed to three different concentrations of NO (40, 80, and 120 parts per million [ppm]) and bacterial growth was compared with the same strains incubated in ambient air for 24 hrs. After incubation (with or without NO), colony-forming units were counted. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Bacterial growth of S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa was not reduced with the NO concentrations applied. The number of colony-forming units of S. aureus increased at 80 ppm of NO. Growth of S. epidermidis and GBS was significantly affected at 120 ppm, resulting in decreased numbers of colony-forming units as compared with controls exposed to ambient air. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that NO has a selective bacteriostatic effect on some of those bacteria most commonly cultured in tracheal specimens of premature infants and neonates. This effect appears to be dose-dependent and occurs in the upper range of dosages used with inhaled NO therapy. However, in the range of dosages applied in ongoing controlled trials of inhaled NO in neonates and premature infants (1 to 80 ppm), a bacteriostatic effect of NO is not to be expected.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1996). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 680 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1996 to May 1997. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.4% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.6% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptabilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) showed the highest activity against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. Imipenem (IPM) and vancomycin (VCM) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA Arbekacin (ABK) and VCM showed the highest activities against both S. aureus and MRSA isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 or 2 micrograms/ml. The others except minocycline (MINO) had low activities with the MIC90S of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and VCM showed the strongest activities against S. epidermis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 2 micrograms/ml. Cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM) and cefozopran (CZOP) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Compared with antimicrobial activities of cephems is 1995, the MIC90S of them had changed into a better state. They ranged from 4 micrograms/ml 16 micrograms/ml in 1996. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except MINO were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, CZOP, IPM, and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 micromilligrams. Tosufloxacin (TFLX) and VCM were also active with the MIC90S of 0.5 micromilligrams. 5. Citrobacter freundii Gentamicin (GM) showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 0.5 micrograms/ml. IPM and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Cefpirome (CPR) and CZOP were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 16 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and TFLX were 1 microgram/ml, the MIC90 of AMK was 2 micrograms/ml, the MIC90S of CZOP, GM and ofloxacin (OFLX) were 4 micrograms/ml. The MIC50S of cephems except CEZ, cefmetazole (CMZ) and cefaclor (CCL) had changed into a better state in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 7. Escherichia coli All drugs except penicillins and MINO were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90S of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Among E. coli strains, those with low susceptibilities to cephems except CEZ, cefoperazone (CPZ), latamoxef (LMOX) and CCL have increased in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. CPR had the strongest activity, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.25 microgram/ml. Flomoxef (FMOX), cefixime (CFIX), CZOP and carumonam (CRMN) were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 9. Pseudomonas aeruginosa All drugs except quinolones were not so active against P. aeruginosa with the MIC90S were 32 micrograms/ml or above. Quinolones were more active in 1996 than 1995. The MIC90S of them were between 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml, and the MIC50S of them were between 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml. 10. Serratia marcescens GM showed the highest activity against S. marcescens. Its MIC90 was 1 micro
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of GV129606, a new broad-spectrum trinem.
AB  - GV129606 is a new parenteral trinem antibiotic belonging to the beta-lactam class. It combines broad-spectrum activity (against gram-negative and -positive bacteria, aerobes and anaerobes), with high potency and resistance to beta-lactamases. Comparative in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities were determined for GV129606 against more than 400 recent clinical isolates (aerobes, including beta-lactamase producers, and anaerobes), using representative antibacterial agents (meropenem, piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin for aerobes and metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin, and clindamycin for anaerobes). Against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and streptococci, GV129606 and meropenem were the most active of the drugs tested. GV129606 showed an MIC for 90% of strains tested (MIC90) ranging from < or =0.015 to 0.06 microg/ml against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae. Against penicillin-susceptible and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, GV129606, meropenem, and cefpirome showed MIC90s of < or =0.015 and 1 microg/ml, respectively. Meropenem was the most active compound against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae with MIC90s of < or =0.5 microg/ml. Against these species, GV129606 possessed activity superior to those of piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, and gentamicin, with MIC90s of < or =8 microg/ml, but its activity was two- to sixfold less than that of ciprofloxacin (with the exception of Proteus rettgeri and Providencia stuartii). Haemophilus spp., Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were also included in the spectrum of GV129606. GV129606 showed good antianaerobe activity, similar to metronidazole. It was stable against all clinically relevant beta-lactamases (similar to meropenem). The in vitro activity was confirmed in vivo against septicemia infections induced in mice by selected gram-positive and -negative bacteria with 50% effective doses (ED50s) of < or =0.05 and < or =0.5 mg/kg of body weight/dose, respectively. GV129606 was as effective as meropenem against septicemia in mice caused by ceftazidime-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, exhibiting an ED50 of 0.33 mg/kg/dose.
TI  - [Study of bacterial flora in the oral cavity and stomach of elderly patients receiving nasogastric tube feeding].
AB  - To investigate the significance of oropharyngeal flora and gastric flora in elderly patients receiving nasogastric tube feeding, throat secretions and gastric aspirates were cultured and the pH of the latter was measured. Of 116 bacterial isolates from throat secretions of 27 elderly patients, 30 were beta-streptococci and 28 were Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bacteria isolated from gastric aspirates numbered 86 and 24 (27.9%) of them were the same species as those found in the throat secretions. Patients with gastric pH were below 3.5 had significantly lower concentrations of gram-negative bacili in gastric aspirates. We also studied oropharyngeal flora in 33 elderly patients who were admitted to Nagoyashi Koseiin Geriatric Hospital. The major bacterial isolates from throat swabs of bedridden patients were gram-negative bacilli and beta-streptococci, especially group B streptococci (GBS). We measured the level of antibody to GBS in these patients. Those from whom GBS were isolated had high titers. These results suggest that in elderly patients receiving enteral nasogastric) tube feeding, large numbers of bacteria colonize the oral cavity and stomach. The measurement of type-specific antibody to GBS may be useful in managing such patients.
TI  - Hydrocortisone 17-butyrate degradation in the presence of micro-organisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study compared the degradation of hydrocortisone 17-butyrate (H17B) in the presence of six different bacteria, commonly found on psoriatic skin. METHOD: H17B and its degradation products (hydrocortisone and hydrocortisone 21-butyrate (H21B)) were assayed by HPLC. RESULTS: In the absence of micro-organisms, we observed 16.6 +/- 7.1% degradation. In the presence of micro-organisms and otherwise similar conditions, we noted that H17B degradation was not modified by cocci (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae). Three bacilli increased degradation, Escherichia coli 59.1 +/- 19.4%, Klebsiella oxytoca 62.1 +/- 6.7% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 56.0 +/- 17.9%. CONCLUSION: The degradation of H17B into hydrortisone and H21B may produce a loss of therapeutic activity.
TI  - In vitro activity of BAY 12-8039, a new 8-methoxyquinolone.
AB  - BAY 12-8039 is a new 8-methoxyquinolone with antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria which is significantly better than those of sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.062 and 2 mg/l, respectively. The MIC90s for ciprofloxacin-resistant, methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 8 mg/l. Against the staphylococcal strains tested sparfloxacin was 2-fold and ciprofloxacin > or = 10-fold less active. MIC90s for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.125-0.5 mg/l, irrespective of whether strains with diminished ciprofloxacin susceptibility or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains were tested. Against the streptococci sparfloxacin was 2- to 4-fold less active. Against gram-negative bacteria BAY 12-8039 is almost as active as ciprofloxacin, except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. BAY 12-8039 was as active as metronidazole. The bactericidal activity against S. aureus and S. pneumoniae was in contrast to that of the other quinolones tested, penicillin G, amoxicillin+/-clavulanate, cefuroxime and clarithromycin, concentration-dependent. As compared to ciprofloxacin, development of resistance was less pronounced. The spontaneous mutation frequency towards BAY 12-8039 resistance was 2.8 x 10(-8) in Escherichia coli, 7.06 x 10(-8) in S. aureus and < 1.4 x 10(-9) in S. pneumoniae.
TI  - An abietane diterpene and two phenolics from Salvia forskahlei.
AB  - From the roots of Salvia forskahlei a new diterpenoid, forskalinone, two new aromatic compounds, the octanol esters of cis- and trans-4-O-methyl-caffeic acid dimers, were isolated together with the known compounds stigmast-3-one, sitosterol and alpha-amyrin. The structures of the new and the known compounds were established by spectral data. The antimicrobial activity of forskalinone and the dimeric cinnamic acid esters was tested against standard bacterial strains and a yeast, namely Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus 6538P, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumonia ATC 4352, Pseudomonus aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, beta-haemolytic Streptococcus and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Forskalinone showed moderate resistance against S. epidermidis (670 micrograms ml-1) and slight activity against E. faecalis (168 micrograms ml-1). trans-4-O-Methyl-caffeic acid dimer octanol ester was inactive while the cis isomer showed a slight activity against C. albicans (156 micrograms ml-1).
TI  - Diffusion of 3-quaternary ammonium cephem antibiotics into cerebrospinal fluid of patients with bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Cefepime and cefpirome are new beta-lactamase resistant parenteral cephalosporin  derivatives whose spectrum of activity makes them suitable for use in the treatment of severe infections such as bacterial meningitis. However, the published information on the penetration of these new agents into human CSF and on their use in the treatment of bacterial meningitis are really scarce. Experimental studies have shown that cefepime and cefpirome penetrated remarkably well into the CSF of animals infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The mean changes in bacterial colony count in CSF after cefpirome or cefepime administration express the antibacterial activity of these drugs. Studies in patients show that cefepime and cefpirome crossed the blood-brain barrier and reached concentrations in the CSF that are bactericidal against most potential pathogens. Higher levels are likely to be achieved with multiple dosing and in the presence of inflamed meninges. No study has been performed to investigate the efficacy of cefpirome in the treatment of bacterial meningitis. Cefepime was as effective and safe as cefotaxime for treatment of patients with bacterial meningitis as shown in the only clinical trial.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1993). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 657 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1993 to May 1994.

TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1992). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 732 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 11 hospitals during the period of June 1992 to May 1993.

TI  - Infection of the pancreatic duct following pancreas transplantation with bladder  drainage.
AB  - Combined kidney-pancreas transplantation represents a widely accepted therapy for endstage diabetic nephropathy. Drainage of the pancreatic juice into the urinary bladder is the preferred surgical technique in most centers. Between January 1987 and December 1994 a total of 85 pancreas transplantations with pancreatocystostomy were performed at the Innsbruck University Hospital. In all cases a polyvinylcatheter was placed into the pancreatic duct and drained transvesically to the exterior. During several weeks after transplantation pure pancreatic juice was harvested for immunological and microbiological monitoring. Whenever a patient required antibiotic treatment, antibiotic concentrations in pancreatic juice, urine or serum were determined by means of a biological test system using Bacillus subtilis. Nine different ATCC bacterial strains were incubated in pancreatic juice collected from transplant recipients and tested for their multiplication rate. Thirteen patients acquired an infection of the pancreatic duct. Non-fermentative bacteria, gram-negative rods, Enterococcus spp. and Candida spp. were the most often isolated organisms. The in vitro tests revealed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Escherichia coli grew very well whereas Streptococcus agalactiae was unable to multiply in pancreatic juice. Ampicillin/sulbactam was found to be excreted in high concentrations into the pancreatic juice. Many other tested antibiotics (cephalosporins, carboxypenicillins and aminoglycosides) achieved levels below the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for most bacteria. Antibiotic treatment was required for up to 5 weeks to eliminate the pathogens from the pancreas but was successful in 11 out of the 13 patients at the end. The results of this study led to changes in our antibiotic policy and helped to improve the results after pancreatic transplantation.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1989). I. Susceptibility distribution].

TI  - [Evidence of antimicrobial activity of the follicular fluid: an evaluation and analytical study of samples obtained in an assisted reproduction program].
AB  - Due to lack of evidence of infection in patients for ovarian punction for ovular  capture, the hypothesis of possible antibacterial action that could exist in follicular fluid, was evaluated. One hundred and ten samples of such fluid, were taken for antibacterial analysis, 37 of which, were studied, as they were the clearest ones and not contaminated. Such samples were obtained from hyperstimulated patients, ready for ovular capture through vagina by ultrasonographic guide. A bacterial inoculum, was prepared, in order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of follicular fluid against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. agalactiae, L. monocytogenes and C. albicans. Counting of bacterial colonies, at 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 hours. Results summary shows bacteriostatic activity in all studied colonies, and E. coli and S. agalactiae seem to be the most sensitive, followed by P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and L. monocytogenes; and still present in C. albicans. It is concluded that follicular fluid has an antibacterial action, probably selective; and that keeping this research line will confirm this finding, and possibly will determine the concerned factors.
TI  - [Yearly changes of isolated organisms from the respiratory tract in Hokusho Central Hospital].
AB  - Isolated organisms from the respiratory tract have been studied in our hospital from 1986 to 1993. The total number of samples were 18,345 and samples which showed 10(5) cfu/ml organisms were 8648 in our hospital for 8 years. Enterobacteriacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and glucose nonfermenting gram-negative rods were major isolates in 8 years. Haemophilus influenzae, which used to be the commonest isolate, decreased from 10.9% in 1993 while Enterobacteriacae increased from 8.9% in 1986 to 17.6% in 1993. S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were major isolates from out-patients consisting of 50%, followed by Enterobacteriacae, P. aeruginosa and MSSA. Enterobacteriacae and P. aeruginosa were major isolates from in-patients, followed by MRSA and beta-Streptococcus. Streptococcus agalactiae, Serratia marcescens and Corynebacterium spp. prevailed especially in the geriatric ward. S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were major isolates from patients with pneumoconiosis, especially in winter.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of cefepime in vitro.
AB  - Cefepime is a new parenterally active fourth-generation cephalosporin which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. Using the standard agar dilution method we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli (98 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (99 strains), Acinetobacter spp. (24 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (98 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (108 strains), Staphylococcus aureus (100 strains), Enterococcus spp. (45 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (10 strains), Streptococcus pyogenes (group A; 19 strains) and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B; 36 strains). Cefepime showed excellent activity against E. coli and K. pneumoniae, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 0.12 mg/l. The in vitro activity of cefepime was superior to or comparable to the third-generation cephalosporins tested but was inferior to ciprofloxacin against Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa. Against H. influenzae, whether or not the strains produced beta-lactamase, its activity was similar to comparable drugs. All 84 isolates of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime whereas, like other cephalosporins, it had little activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Of the 45 enterococci isolates tested, 44.4% were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime. Against streptococci, its activity was superior to any drug tested. This in vitro study indicates that cefepime has the potential to be a valuable agent for the treatment of community- and hospital-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.
TI  - Agar disk diffusion (Bauer-Kirby) tests with various fastidious and nonfastidious reference (ATCC) strains: comparison of several agar media.
AB  - Several agar media (Mueller-Hinton agar, MHA; diagnostic sensitivity test agar, DSTA; Schaedler agar, SchA; Todd-Hewitt agar with added yeast extract, THYA; Wilkins-Chalgren agar, WCA) were compared using the Bauer-Kirby agar disk diffusion test against six nonfastidious quality control strains: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and ATCC 29213, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and ATCC 35218, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212. MHA, DSTA, and THYA yielded essentially comparable inhibition zones. However, WCA and SchA antagonized cotrimoxazole and aminoglycoside antibiotics; furthermore, SchA antagonized polymyxin B, and both WCA and SchA antagonized imipenem against the P. aeruginosa strain, but not against the E. coli strains. Sheep blood-MHA (Bl-MHA), WCA, THYA, and DSTA were examined with Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615, Streptococcus agalactiae ATCC 13813, and Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 6306. In comparison with Bl-MHA, both WCA and THYA yielded comparable inhibition zones against S. pyogenes; DSTA afforded suboptimal growth. DSTA yielded larger inhibition zones with the majority of antimicrobial drugs against S. agalactiae, whereas WCA and THYA enhanced the activity of oxacillin and penicillin G against this strain. S. pneumoniae strain ATCC 6306 grew well on Bl-MHA, yielded suboptimal growth on WCA and faint growth on THYA, and failed to grow on DSTA. Chocolate-supplemented sheep blood-MHA (CHOC-MHA) was compared with Haemophilus test medium (HTM), WCA with added NAD, and THYA with added hematin and NAD against Haemophilus influenzae strains ATCC 35056 and ATCC 49247. The activities of doxycycline and rifampin were enhanced against both strains by HTM, WCA+NAD, and THYA+hematin+NAD. Only WCA+NAD antagonized cotrimoxazole against both H. influenzae strains, an effect due to thymidine; however, HTM antagonized cotrimoxazole against S. aureus ATCC 25923 and E. coli ATCC 25922. It was concluded that Bl-MHA performed best for beta-hemolytic streptococci quality control strains. Likewise, CHOC-MHA was optimal for the two H. influenzae strains used in this comparative agar disk diffusion study.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of PD 138312 and PD 140248, new fluoronaphthyridines with outstanding gram-positive potency.
AB  - PD 138312 and PD 140248 are new quinolones with high in vitro activities against  a wide spectrum of bacterial species, notably including gram-positive isolates. The respective MICs (in micrograms per milliliter) of PD 138312 and PD 140248 capable of inhibiting > or = 90% of the strains were < or = 0.06 and < or = 0.06 for oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococci, streptococci (including Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, and viridans group streptococci), Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; 0.125 and 0.03 for Legionella pneumophila; 0.25 and 0.125 for Listeria monocytogenes; 0.25 and 0.25 for Enterococcus faecalis; 0.5 and 0.06 for anaerobic gram-positive cocci; 0.5 and 0.25 for Acinetobacter spp.; 0.5 and 0.5 for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (excluding Serratia marcescens); 2 and 0.5 for Bacteroides fragilis; 2 and 2 for Serratia marcescens and ciprofloxacin-resistant staphylococci; and 8 and 4 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - In vitro activities of BAY Y3118, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract and soft tissue infections.
AB  - BAY Y3118 was highly active against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC for 90% of strains tested [MIC90], 0.063 micrograms/ml). For Enterococcus faecalis and Corynebacterium jeikeium, MIC90s were 4 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. BAY Y3118 was as active as ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and had potent activity against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml).
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin and its effect on bacterial adherence to medical material].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin (CAM) in comparison with other 6 macrolides was determined against 419 recent clinical isolates including Streptococci, Enterococci, Staphylococci, Moraxella, Haemophilus and Bacteroides strains. MICs80's of CAM against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.78, 0.10 and 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. MICs80's against Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae were 0.05 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. Laboratory-induced resistance to CAM in strains of S. pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis occurred in stepwise fashion and at a very low rate. Adherence to silicon filter of strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or S. epidermidis was strongly repressed by the addition of sub-MIC of CAM or other macrolides. Although tosufloxacin (TFLX) alone had no bactericidal activity against the sessile cells of P. aeruginosa strains tested, TFLX showed synergistic bactericidal activity when combined with sub-MICs of CAM or erythromycin.
TI  - Immunodiagnosis of group-A streptococci by latex agglutination assays with monoclonal or monospecific polyvalent antibodies.
AB  - Seven clones of murine monoclonal antibodies specific for group-A streptococci were generated. All of them were of IgM isotypes and recognized trypsinized as well as nontrypsinized group-A streptococci and polysaccharide. These were devoid of reactivity with streptococci-B, -C, -G and Staphylococcus aureus. Polyclonal antibodies against group-A polysaccharide (APS) were also raised in rabbits by linking APS to bovine serum albumin, and rendered monospecific by adsorption. Latex agglutination assays were developed employing both types of antibodies. The assay employing monospecific polyvalent antibodies had a sensitivity of 12.5 ng APS/ml as compared to 1 microgram APS/ml for latex sensitized with monoclonal antibodies. Both assays were specific, as no agglutination was observed with polysaccharides obtained from streptococci-B, -C, -G, Staph. aureus, Cornybacterium diptheriae, Candida albicans, Candida spp., Morexella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Strep. pneumoniae. Salmonella typhi and S. paratyphi A and B. Throat swabs from children obtained in duplicate, when tested for the presence of streptococci-A, showed a good correlation of the results obtained by latex agglutination assay with the microbial culture test and serogrouping.
TI  - [Clinical and experimental study of xiao er ke cuan ling oral liquid in the treatment of infantile bronchopneumonia].
AB  - Xiao Er Ke Chuan Ling Oral Liquid (KCL) is a Chinese herbal preparation consisted of 10 herbs such as Prunus armeniacae, Scutelaria baicalensis, Lonicera japonica etc. 30 children suffering from bronchopneumonia and/or acute bronchitis were treated with KCL (treated group) and another 30 cases were treated with penicillin and aminophylline (control group). RESULTS: cure rate and effective rate in treated group was 26.6%, and 93.3% respectively. While in control group was 30% and 96.6% respectively. No significant differences were seen between them(P > 0.05). The pharmacodynamic experiment showed KCL had potent pharmacological action. The experiment on tracheal fragment of Guinea pig in vitro showed it caused moderately strong smooth muscle relaxation, through inhibition the effect of histamine and acetylcholine. Asthma induction experiment of Guinea pig in vivo showed KCL could significantly prolong the latent period of asthma and alleviate asthmatic symptom. Ammonium water cough induction experiment in mice showed it may apparently prolong cough latent period and reduce times of cough relapse and alleviate cough symptom. KCL had potent antipyretic effect on fever model induced by triple vaccine in rabbits. Bacteriostatic and antiviral experiment in vitro showed the drug had quite strong inhibitory effects for Streptococcus hemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Flexners Dysentery bacillus, Diplococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and it could potently inhibit the respiratory syncytial virus. KCL is an effective drug in treating bronchopneumonia and acute bronchitis.
TI  - Antibacterial in vitro-activity of meropenem against 200 clinical isolates in comparison to 11 selected antibiotics.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was tested  in vitro by an agar dilution method against 200 clinical isolates (gram-negative/positive aerobes and anaerobes). Meropenem was compared with imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin; and metronidazole, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, vancomycin when appropriate. Meropenem and imipenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Only one strain each of Enterococcus faecium and Pseudomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia were resistant. Of the carbapenems, imipenem was slightly more active against Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococci, but meropenem was obviously more active against enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium perfringens. Both, meropenem and imipenem had similar activities towards Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacteroides sp. All other antibiotics tested were less potent than the carbapenems with the exception of ciprofloxacin which generally exhibited similar antibacterial activities, except for anaerob microorganisms.
TI  - [Basic and clinical study of meropenem in pediatric field].
AB  - Meropenem (MEPM), a novel parenteral carbapenem antibiotic, was examined in a cooperative study involving 12 pediatric and 1 neonatologic facilities. The results are summarized as follows. 1. Antibacterial activity Antibacterial activity of MEPM against stock organisms including 31 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 14 of Listeria monocytogenes, 4 of Bordetella pertussis and 3 of Neisseria meningitidis ranged from 0.025 to 0.10 micrograms/ml in MIC90's, which were equal or lower than those of control drugs such as imipenem cefazolin, cefotiam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and latamoxef. MICs against clinical isolates were as follows: In Gram-positive bacteria, MICs were 0.20 micrograms/ml to 6.25 micrograms/ml against 3 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, and 0.025 micrograms/ml or less against 4 of Streptococcus pneumoniae. In Gram-negative bacilli, MICs were 0.10 micrograms/ml to 0.20 micrograms/ml against 3 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 0.78, 0.10 and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively, against one strain each of Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. MIC against 1 strain of Peptococcus saccharolyticus was < or = 0.025 micrograms/ml. 2. Pharmacokinetics Maximum plasma concentrations after intravenous infusion of MEPM over 30 minutes at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg, respectively, to 3 different groups of 3 children (total 9 cases) were observed at the completion of the treatment. Mean maximum concentrations in the 3 groups were 36.3, 69.5 and 129.8 micrograms/ml, respectively, exhibiting clear dose response. Mean plasma half lives in beta phase were 0.94, 0.86 and 0.94 hours, respectively, exhibiting no difference by doses, and this trend was observed also by HPLC. Urinary excretion rates in the first 6 hours after dose in the 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg groups were 67.3, 65.6 and 68.4%, respectively. Concentrations of MEPM in cerebrospinal fluid were determined in 2 cases of pyogenic meningitis. In 1 case, 500 mg (5.9 mg/kg) of MEPM was infused intravenously over 30 minutes and concentrations on Days 6, 8 and 15 observed at 190, 60 and 100 minutes after respective doses were 0.13, 0.10 micrograms/ml and less than the detection limit. Cerebrospinal fluid-plasma concentration ratio was determinable only on Day 8 and was 2.8%. In another case to which 250 mg (38.5 mg/kg) of MEPM was infused intravenously over 30 minutes, the concentration at Days 6, 7 and 10, 1 hour after the dose were less than the detection limit on day 6, and 2.04 and 2.62 micrograms/ml, respectively on days 7 and 10. 3. Clinical efficacy Clinical efficacies were evaluated in 49 cases and the efficacy rate was 93.9%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [A report of two cases of cervical necrotizing soft-tissue infection].
AB  - Two recent cases of cervical necrotizing soft-tissue infection are herein presented. Case 1. A 52-year-old man with uncontrolled diabetes was hospitalized because of an erythematous swelling of the left side of his neck and high grade fever. Fetid yellowish pus exuded from the left parotid area. The swelling extended from the left temporal area to the left supraclavicular fossa, with necrosis of the parotid gland, sternocleidomastoid, masseter and a portion of the strap muscles. Wound cultures revealed Staphylococcus aureus and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus. No anaerobic bacteria were detected. Treatment consisted of intravenous administration of antibiotics, control of diabetes with insulin, and debridement of the necrotic tissue, which left an epidermal defect in the initially swollen area. Transfer of a forearm free flap was done after the growth of healthy granulation tissue over the affected area. Case 2. A 55-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis was transferred to our hospital after tracheotomy performed in another hospital because of dyspnea due to severe crepitant swelling of her cheeks and submandibular areas bilaterally, and her left temporal area. A copious amount of fetid pus exuded from the incisions made in the left temporal area, left cheek, and right submandibular area. There were bilateral diffuse rales. Culturing the pus revealed alpha-hemolytic streptococci, while MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were detected from cultures of sputum. No anaerobic bacteria were found. After intravenous administration of antibiotics, infected wounds and pneumonia were ameliorated, and necrotic subcutaneous tissue and fascia were debrided. The patient was discharged with a residual depression in her left cheek and a scar on her left temporal area.
TI  - The bactericidal effect of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase on bacteria.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase) on some of  the potential bacterial pathogens of the cow was determined. NAGase treatment significantly decreased the mean log10 number of Actinomyces pyogenes (P less than 0.01) and Staphylococcus aureus (P less than 0.05) after 2 and 4 hours of incubation at 37 degrees C. Similarly NAGase treatment significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced the mean log10 number of Streptococcus agalactiae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa after 4 hours incubation at 37 degrees C. NAGase did not reduce the numbers of Escherichia coli or Enterobacter aerogenes after either 2 or 4 hours incubation. Since NAGase and presumably other lysosomal enzymes are free on normal mucosal surfaces such as the uterus it is suggested that this direct bactericidal activity may be an important component of the normal defense mechanisms.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of RU29246, the active metabolite of HR916B.
AB  - HR 916B is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. In tests its active metabolite, RU29246, inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the antibacterial activity of cefuroxime, and was more active than cefaclor. It was also more active (MIC 2 micrograms/ml) than cefixime, cefuroxime, cefaclor and cefotaxime against staphylococci. RU29246 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii and Salmonella spp. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, thus being more active than cefuroxime and cefaclor, but was less active than cefixime and cefotaxime. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens or Bacteroides fragilis. RU29246 was not hydrolyzed by TEM-1, Staphylococcus aureus TEM-2 or Moraxella catarrhalis beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Proteus vulgaris and Morganella morganii. Plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases were inhibited by RU29246.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of the fluoroquinolones PD 117596, PD 124816, and PD 127391.
AB  - Three new aminopyrrolidine-substituted fluorocyclopropyl quinolones--PD 117596, PD 124816, and PD 127391--were tested for in vitro antibacterial activity against 349 bacterial strains, which are primarily clinical isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) in micrograms/ml required for greater than or equal to 90% of strains were 0.03-0.06 for staphylococci (26 strains); 0.06-0.25 for Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis (80); less than or equal to 0.015 for Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (42); 0.06 for Enterobacteriaceae (97); 0.125-0.25 for Acinetobacter spp. (14); 0.5 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20); 0.125-1.0 for Bacteroides fragilis (13); and 0.25-0.5 for anaerobic cocci (11). These activities were generally superior to that of ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ampicillin, penicillin G, oxacillin, cefazolin, ceftazidime, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, aztreonam, piperacillin, amikacin, spectinomycin, doxycycline, erythomycin, clindamycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin. The activities of the new quinolones were generally unchanged with light, 50% human serum, aerobic/anaerobic atmosphere, 5% sodium choate, cation supplementation, and 100-fold increased or decreased inoculum; as with other quinolones, potency was measurably diminished with decreasing pH (pH less than or equal to 6.0) and in 100% urine.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of PD 131628, a new 1,8-naphthyridine anti-infective agent.
AB  - PD 131628 is a new aminopyrrolidine-substituted fluorocyclopropyl naphthyridine quinolone which possesses high in vitro activity against a wide spectrum of bacterial species. The MICs for greater than or equal to 90% of strains were 0.125 to 0.25 microgram/ml for staphylococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, and S. pneumoniae; 0.5 micrograms/ml for S. agalactiae and Enterococcus faecalis; 0.125 micrograms/ml for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter spp.; 0.5 micrograms/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and less than or equal to 0.03 micrograms/ml for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In these in vitro comparisons with ciprofloxacin, PD 131628 is more active against gram-positive organisms, approximately equivalent against gram-negative organisms, and, like most other quinolones, relatively inactive against gram-negative anaerobes. In most instances, the in vitro potency of PD 131628 exceeded those of widely used compounds: ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ampicillin, penicillin G, oxacillin, cefazolin, ceftazidime, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, aztreonam, piperacillin, amikacin, spectinomycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of ceftibuten against multiply-resistant microorganisms from Belgium.
AB  - To study the activity of ceftibuten, we obtained multiply-resistant isolates from approximately 20 hospitals in Belgium. Against Enterobacteriaceae, all of the tested comparative compounds were more active than cefaclor, and ceftibuten and tigemonam were the most active of the agents tested. Ceftibuten MIC50s were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml for most enteric bacilli species and 85% of strains were susceptible (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml). This level of activity compared favorably to that recorded for cefaclor (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml), cefetamet (less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml), and cefteram (less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml), that is, 37%, 69%, and 59%, respectively. Ceftibuten, cefetamet, cefteram, and tigemonam were highly active against isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. None of the comparative agents were as active as cefaclor against staphylococcal isolates. Against streptococci, cefteram was the most active, and tigemonam the least active of the agents. The MIC90s of ceftibuten for strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were 2 micrograms/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively. Strains of Streptococcus agalactiae were resistant to both ceftibuten and tigemonam; cefaclor and cefteram inhibited 100% of isolates of this species. Strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were consistently resistant to all of the compounds. Overall, ceftibuten exhibited potent activity against many multiply-resistant clinical isolates.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinically isolated bacterial strains to imipenem/cilastatin sodium].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activities of imipenem/cilastatin sodium (imipenem) and other beta-lactams against clinically isolated 353 bacterial strains were investigated. The results obtained in this study are summarized as follows: 1. Imipenem (IPM) showed potent antibacterial activities against Gram-positive cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae. 2. IPM had inferior or equivalent antibacterial activities to beta-lactams against clinically isolated Enterobacteriaceae, that is, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus spp. 3. IPM showed potent antibacterial activities against clinically isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter anitratus but not against Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Comparison of norfloxacin versus nalidixic acid in therapy of acute urinary tract infections.
AB  - Thirty-seven adult patients with acute urinary tract infections (UTI) were randomized to receive either a seven day (lower UTI) or a 14 day (upper UTI) course of norfloxacin 400 mg orally twice daily, or nalidixic acid 1 g orally four times per day. Mean age, underlying disease and infecting organisms were similar in the two groups. Nine patients in the norfloxacin group and seven in the nalidixic acid group had presumptive evidence of upper UTI. Overall, 12 patients had antibody-coated bacteria-positive infections. The infecting organisms were: Escherichia coli (27), coagulase-negative staphylococci (four), Citrobacter freundii (three), Klebsiella pneumoniae (three), and Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter agglomerans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis (one of each). All of the organisms were susceptible to norfloxacin, while 81% were susceptible to nalidixic acid. The effects on the periurethral and anal canal flora were similar in both groups. Five patients in each group experienced adverse clinical effects. The cure rates for norfloxacin and nalidixic acid were 79 and 83%, respectively. There were two failures, two relapses and four reinfections in the norfloxacin group. In the nalidixic acid group, there were two failures, one relapse and four reinfections. One of the failure patients in the nalidixic acid group developed resistance to the drug, and two of the four reinfections were due to organisms resistant to nalidixic acid. In this patient population it was concluded that nalidixic acid may be as effective as norfloxacin in the treatment of acute, symptomatic UTI.
TI  - Therapeutic studies of cefepime (BMY 28142) in murine meningitis and pharmacokinetics in neonatal rats.
AB  - Cefepime (BMY 28142) was compared with ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and moxalactam for efficacy in treating experimental meningitis in mice and neonatal rats. Mice were infected intracranially with Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and treated intramuscularly. Five- to eight-day-old neonatal rats were injected intracisternally with Haemophilus influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and S. agalactiae and treated intraperitoneally. Cefepime was found to be the most active compound against induced meningitis in mice infected with S. agalactiae. Cefepime was as active as cefotaxime against Staphylococcus aureus meningitis, slightly more active than cefotaxime against S. pneumoniae and E. coli, and as active as ceftazidime against K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa meningitis. Cefepime was found to be the most active compound against S. pneumoniae and S. agalactiae meningitis in neonatal rats. Against H. influenzae, cefepime was as active as moxalactam and cefotaxime. Ceftazidime was the least active compound. The pharmacokinetics of cefepime in neonatal rats were similar to those of ceftazidime. Both compounds penetrated well into cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissues of uninfected neonatal rats. Relative concentrations were twice as high as those of cefotaxime and moxalactam.
TI  - Purification, composition, and activity of two bactenecins, antibacterial peptides of bovine neutrophils.
AB  - Extracts of granules of bovine neutrophils are known to exhibit a marked antibacterial activity in vitro. By a simple, two-step chromatographic procedure, we have resolved two peptide components of the antibacterial system. They were named Bac-5 and Bac-7 from the general term bactenecin and had molecular masses of about 5 and 7 kilodaltons, respectively. Over 45 and 20% of the amino acid residues in the two bactenecins are proline and arginine, respectively. The remaining amino acids are mainly hydrophobic (isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine). Both Bac-5 and Bac-7 efficiently kill Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. They also arrest the growth of Enterobacter cloacae (MICs, 25 to 200 micrograms/ml) but not of Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC, greater than 200 micrograms/ml). Finally, Bac-7 but not Bac-5 has MICs of less than or equal to 200 micrograms/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis. From the comparison between the efficient bactericidal concentrations in vitro and the estimated content of bactenecins in neutrophils (125 ng of Bac-5 and Bac-7 each per 10(6) cells), it is reasonable to conclude that the two cationic peptides may exert a major role in host defense against at least some microorganisms.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - Species-specific interpretive breakpoints for ciprofloxacin disk diffusion susceptibility testing.
AB  - When ciprofloxacin was introduced on the Swedish market the recommended interpretive standards for disk diffusion susceptibility testing using a 10 microgram disk were: Sensitive greater than or equal to 24 mm (MIC less than or equal to 1 mg/l) and Resistant less than 18 mm (MIC greater than 4 mg/l), except for enterococci where S greater than or equal to 18 mm and R less than 14 mm were recommended. A quality control study revealed that the accuracy of the routine susceptibility testing of ciprofloxacin was low. 50% of the strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 90% of Streptococcus agalactiae strains were falsely assigned to the intermediate instead of the sensitive category, and the test missed to detect true resistance in Pseudomonas maltophilia. New species-specific breakpoints were determined by the SRA method. Separate breakpoints were required only for the pseudomonas species. Streptococcus faecalis was found to belong mainly to the intermediate group and it is suggested that these strains are not categorized as sensitive. The breakpoints that gave acceptable accuracy in routine susceptibility testing of ciprofloxacin were S greater than or equal to 20 mm, R less than 13 mm for all relevant bacteria except Pseudomonas aeruginosa for which S greater than or equal to 27 mm, R less than 18 mm is proposed, and Pseudomonas maltophilia where S greater than or equal to 30 mm, R less than 23 mm are adequate breakpoints. The 10 microgram disk gave acceptable inhibition zones for all strains with MICs within the clinically interesting MIC range.
TI  - Lung antibacterial defense mechanisms in infant and adult rats: implications for  the pathogenesis of group B streptococcal infections in the neonatal lung.
AB  - We investigated factors that may contribute to lung infections in infants by studying the intrapulmonary responses to aerosols of three different types of organisms--group B streptococcus with and without type-specific capsule, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus--in infant (12-h-old or 24-36-h-old) and adult (150 g, 6-w-old) rats. After aerosol exposure, the lung clearance rate of each organism varied inversely with the age of the animals, and the magnitude of the clearance defect was related more strongly to animal age than to the bacterial species. Fewer alveolar macrophages from infant animals phagocytosed each type of organism in vivo, and the rate of neutrophil accumulation in the lungs of infant animals was delayed. The neonatal lung functioned effectively, however, as an antibacterial barrier, as newborn animals survived an aerosolized inoculum that exceeded the LD50 by the subcutaneous route.
TI  - The effect of transferrin and lysozyme on antibacterial activity of amniotic fluid.
AB  - Amniotic fluid obtained from normal full term gestation inhibited the growth of E. coli, Staph. aureus and B. subtilis, while Ps. aeruginosa, Str. faecalis and Str. agalactiae proliferated readily in amniotic fluid. But when amniotic fluid was heated at 100 degrees C for 5 minutes, its antibacterial activity was completely lost. The levels of transferrin and lysozyme in amniotic fluid at term were determined to be 29.1 +/- 17.6 mg/100 ml (n = 90) and 19.1 +/- 8.3 micrograms/ml (n = 145), respectively. Antibacterial activity against E. coli was restored by adding transferrin into heat-treated amniotic fluid at a concentration of 250 mg/100 ml or higher, but simultaneous addition of transferrin and sufficient concentration of iron to form a transferrin-iron complex resulted in the loss of antibacterial activities. When lysozyme was added to the amniotic fluid, which had lost its antibacterial activity through exposure to heat, the antibacterial effect on B. subtilis was restored. The growth of Staph. aureus in heat-treated amniotic fluid was inhibited by the concomitant addition of lysozyme and aminobenzyl penicillin.
TI  - Silver-coated nylon fiber as an antibacterial agent.
AB  - A blend of nylon fiber and silver-coated nylon fiber (the latter known as X-static) was used in these experiments. This fiber was bactericidal when bacteria were exposed to it directly or to an extract derived from its prior incubation in salt solution. At ambient temperatures, a rapid exponential decrease of survival occurred, usually after a delay of approximately 1 h. The rate of killing (decrease of survival) increased with an increase in X-static percentage of the fiber blend, temperature of fiber extraction, concentration of Tris buffer present during extraction, and temperature at which bacteria were exposed to the extract. When bacteria were exposed to the extract at 37 degrees C as opposed to ambient temperature, there was no delay in onset of killing. Escherichia coli was generally the indicator organism tested, but comparable results were also found for Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus species. The rate of killing increased with increasing silver ion concentration of the fiber extract, as determined through atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The rate of killing was greater and the onset was earlier with an extract containing silver ions from fiber than with a salt solution containing the same concentration of silver ions from silver nitrate. Studies of the kinetics of ion release suggested that X-static may be an effective, sustained-release antibacterial agent.
TI  - In-vitro activity of newer quinolones against aerobic bacteria.
AB  - Nalidixic and five newer 4-quinolones, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin were tested against 576 recent clinical aerobic bacterial isolates. The 4-quinolones were regularly active (MIC90 less than 4 mg/l) against the following bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, different Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Agrobacter spp., Aeromonas spp., Plesiomonas spp., Neisseria meningitidis. Other bacteria were usually intermediately susceptible or resistant: different streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Nocardia asteroides, P. maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxydans and Alcaligenes denitrificans. Ciprofloxacin was the most potent compound, followed by ofloxacin and pefloxacin, norfloxacin and enoxacin being less active. All the 4-quinolones were much more active than nalidixic acid. The MBC/MIC ratios of the 4-quinolones were between 1 and 2 with a majority of strains, and between 2 and 3 with Streptococcus agalactiae, Str. faecalis and L. monocytogenes. A two- to eight-fold increase of MIC was observed by increasing the inoculum 10,000-fold with most of the strains tested. Susceptible bacterial population of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens and P. aeruginosa contained more clones resistant to nalidixic acid (10(4) to 10(8) at four times the MIC) than to 4-quinolones (10(5) to 10(9) at four times the MIC). Supplementing the media with MgSO4 produced smaller inhibition zone diameters with a disc diffusion method than those obtained with non-supplemented agar, with all quinolone or strains. Less regular effect, or no effect was obtained after supplementation with ZnSO4 or Ca(NO3)2.
TI  - Role of cephalosporins in the treatment of bacterial meningitis in adults. Overview with special emphasis on ceftazidime.
AB  - Experience with the use of first-generation cephalosporins in bacterial meningitis has been disappointing; low concentrations were obtained in the cerebrospinal fluid, and therapeutic failures were encountered. Of the second-generation cephalosporins cefamandole, cefuroxime, and cefoxitin, only cefuroxime has proved efficacy in meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or Hemophilus influenzae. The third-generation cephalosporins offer new advantages in the treatment of meningitis because they are active at the cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtainable. Cefotaxime has produced high cure rates in patients with meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or H. influenzae. Several controlled comparative studies indicate that ceftriaxone is as effective as conventional treatment in therapy for neonatal or childhood meningitis caused by Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, or H. influenzae. Moxalactam has been found in uncontrolled studies to be effective when the cause was enteric gram-negative bacilli. Ceftazidime is a new cephalosporin with a high degree of beta-lactamase stability and a broad antibacterial spectrum, which includes Pseudomonas aeruginosa that enters the cerebrospinal fluid. Data from 29 patients who received ceftazidime as monotherapy for bacterial meningitis showed an overall cure or improvement rate of 75.9 percent. Therapy failed in three patients with meningitis caused by gram-positive organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. agalactiae), and in three with gram-negative organisms. Of 14 patients with Pseudomonas meningitis, 11 showed a cure, as did six of six patients with meningitis caused by Enterobacter, Serratia, or Acinetobacter. More, preferably controlled, studies of the efficacy of ceftazidime in the treatment of meningitis should be undertaken.
TI  - Evaluation of Malthus 128H microbiological growth analyser for detecting significant bacteriuria.
AB  - In a pilot study a prototype Malthus 128H microbiological growth analyser was used to study the growth of six commonly encountered urinary pathogens in a range of five different laboratory media. No single medium had been able to show acceptable conductance changes for all bacteria within five hours. Subsequently, the Malthus system, with fastidious anaerobe broth as the culture medium, was used to screen 500 consecutive clinical specimens of urine for significant bacteriuria. After two and a half hours the Malthus system detected 32 out of the 40 true positives and eight of the 44 contaminated urines. Increasing the detection time to five hours permitted the recognition of 39 true positives and 37 contaminated urines.
TI  - [Evaluation of bacterial growth rate by the ATP-bioluminescence method (luciferase assay)--comparison with conventional methods and application to clinical studies].
AB  - Bacterial growth rate was evaluated by estimating the increase in ATP content of  cultures of bacterial suspensions using luciferase assay, and the method was applied to the estimation of bactericidal activity of serum and anti-bacterial activity of antibiotics. The results obtained were as follows: The bacterial numbers or bacterial growth rate determined by the ATP-Bioluminescence method was in accordance with those by CFU assay and spectrometrical assay by optical density readings. Furthermore this method was confirmed to be non-time-consuming and more simple than other methods. Using this method, anti-bacterial activity of fresh serum was evaluated. The serum suppressed the growth rate of E. coli, Str. fecalis, CBS, Kleb. pneumoniae and Staph. aureus at least for 2 hours. Heat-inactivated serum and absorbed serum with bacteria tended to lose such suppressive effect. Thus the main effective factors seem to be complements and specific antibody. The anti-microbial activity of antibiotics was enhanced by addition of fresh serum to bacterial cultures, and the results were not in accordance with those by the conventional Disc method. Thus the sensitivity test under the influence of fresh serum is recommended in order to know the clinical effect of antibiotics. These results suggest the usefulness of ATP-Bioluminescence method in the clinical laboratory examinations or investigations.
TI  - Cefmenoxime: clinical evaluation.
AB  - Cefmenoxime was evaluated in an open trial consisting of 41 patients. Forty infections in 36 patients could be evaluated. Thirteen patients had pyelonephritis due to Escherichia coli (two bacteremic), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Streptococcus faecalis; all improved and 12 of 13 were clinically cured, but one relapse (S. faecalis) occurred at two weeks. Six patients with cystitis due to E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, P. aeruginosa, or S. faecalis all improved, but relapse or reinfection, or both, occurred in five due to P. aeruginosa, S. faecalis, C. fruendii, or E. coli. Neurogenic bladder or other complications were present in five of 13 patients with pyelonephritis and five of six with cystitis. Ten patients with pneumonia and one with tracheobronchitis due to Hemophilus influenzae, S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, or Neisseria meningitidis all improved and seven had resolution without relapse, but P. aeruginosa emerged in two patients, one of whom died. Eight soft tissue infections due to Staphylococcus aureus, Peptococcus prevotti, Streptococcus species, or infections of mixed origin resolved in six. Sterility of blood cultures was obtained in one patient with endocarditis due to S. anginosus, but other therapy was substituted. Clinical resolution of the toxic shock syndrome and subsequent negative endocervical cultures for S. aureus occurred in one. Granulocytopenia of unverified cause in four (with less than 1,500 mm3) and two (with less than 2,000 mm3) was reversible. Headache during treatment occurred in six patients and a possible disulfiram-like effect in three. Elevations of serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase and alkaline phosphatase occurred in five, Coombs' positivity in two, and diarrhea in three. Clinical efficacy of cefmenoxime was significant. Possible side effects require further study.
TI  - Evaluation of experimental teat dip containing sodium chlorite and lactic acid by excised teat assay.
AB  - An experimental teat dip containing sodium chlorite and lactic acid, diluted in water, was evaluated by excised teat protocol. The teat dip was tested against 21 microorganisms. Included were: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Numerous strains were tested for strain differences. Environmental bacteria were included because of their increasing importance as a cause of bovine mastitis. All excised teats were dipped in a bacterial suspension containing about 1 X 10(8) cfu/ml. Negative control teats were not dipped in a germicidal compound. Positive controls were dipped in 1% iodophor. Effectiveness of the experimental teat dip was expressed as the percent reduction in mean log of bacteria recovered from dipped teats as compared to numbers recovered from control teats. The sodium chlorite - lactic acid dip caused a greater percent log reduction than iodophor for 14 of 21 strains tested. However, differences were generally slight. The experimental teat dip appeared effective against Gram-negative bacteria. Some differences in percent log reduction were observed between strains of the same species. Lowest effectiveness and greatest strain variation were observed with Staphylococcus aureus for both dips tested.
TI  - Reversible inhibition of bacterial growth after specific inhibition of spermidine synthase by dicyclohexylamine.
AB  - The effect of dicyclohexylamine on seven freshly isolated bacterial strains of mastitis pathogens was studied. Streptococcus uberis was the most sensitive strain investigated, since 5 mM-dicyclohexylamine totally arrested its growth and 1.25 mM of the drug caused 60% growth inhibition. The Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were also sensitive to the drug, but less so than Strep. uberis, since 5 mM drug caused only partial inhibition of growth. Micrococcus sp. and Klebsiella sp. grew in the presence of 10.0 mM-dicyclohexylamine, and, finally the growth of Streptococcus agalactiae was not at all affected by dicyclohexylamine. These different sensitivities towards dicyclohexylamine in vivo were paralleled by different sensitivities of the bacteria's spermidine synthase to the drug in vitro, and also by the ability of the drug to lower spermidine concentration in bacterial cells. Spermidine synthase from sensitive bacteria was inhibited by more than 90% by 50 microM-dicyclohexylamine in vitro, and the concentration of spermidine was decreased in E. coli and Ps. aeruginosa by 70% and in Strep. uberis by 95%, whereas in Strep. agalactiae 5 mM-dicyclohexylamine did not affect the concentration of spermidine at all. Dicyclohexylamine treatment led to the accumulation of putrescine in Strep. uberis. Spermidine synthesis catalysed by the extracts of Micrococcus sp. required 500 microM-dicyclohexylamine for 90% inhibition, and Strep. agalactiae contained a spermidine synthase that was still active at 1000 microM-dicyclohexylamine, The observed inhibition of growth was totally reversed by adding 50 microM-spermidine (final concentration) to the medium. Putrescine reversed the inhibition only when bacteria had a spermidine synthase activity insensitive to dicyclohexylamine. Spermine did not overcome the inhibition of growth caused by dicyclohexylamine, probably because it was not taken up by the bacterial cells used in this study. The inhibition of the growth by dicyclohexylamine (even in the case of Strep. uberis) was reversible in the sense that addition of 50 microM-spermidine 18 h after dicyclohexylamine still restored the growth rate of untreated controls.
TI  - The effects of group B streptococcus and other organisms on the pulmonary vasculature.
AB  - In this article, the authors review the effects of group B streptococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli on the pulmonary vasculature and the possible mechanisms involved in their genesis.
TI  - Assessment in the mouse of cefoperazone as a treatment for mastitis.
AB  - The value of cefoperazone in mastitis therapy was assessed in the mouse model of  mastitis primarily by its effect on bacterial cell numbers in the gland. In addition histological studies showed that the drug was not an irritant in the mammary gland. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that it was slowly absorbed from the gland (six days to absorb 500 micrograms) but was easily removed by milking. In ascending order of efficacy cefoperazone (500 micrograms/gland) was active against four-hour-old intramammary infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and Strep uberis. The effect against Staph aureus was titrated down to a dose of 50 micrograms/gland. Cefoperazone was not bactericidal against intracellular staphylococci but it did sensitise them to the action of lytic enzyme. Cefoperazone and cloxacillin behaved similarly against progressive staphylococcal mastitis. Both antibiotics significantly reduced the bacterial numbers when four-hour-old infections were treated but the effect on 26-hour-old infections was perceptible only when each antibiotic was assayed against saline treatment in the mouse. The results suggest that further studies in dairy cattle should be undertaken.
TI  - Interbacterial adherence between Actinomyces viscosus and strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Interbacterial adherence was sought between strains of Actinomyces viscosus indigenous to the human mouth and strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Six of nine strains of S. pyogenes, three of five strains of S. agalactiae, and two of four strains of P. aeruginosa were found to coaggregate with each of five strains of A. viscosus tested. Some coaggregation reactions were inhibited by 0.05 M lactose and were dependent upon heat- and protease-sensitive Actinomyces components. Such reactions appear to involve the galactosyl-binding adhesin previously described in type 2 fimbriae on A. viscosus. Other coaggregation reactions were dependent upon heat- and protease-sensitive components of the pathogen. That such pathogen strains possessed an adhesin(s) was further suggested by the observation that they agglutinated human erythrocytes. The ability of coaggregation-positive and -negative strains of S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae to adhere to Actinomyces-coated agarose beads was also studied. Coaggregation-positive streptococcal strains attached in higher numbers to the Actinomyces-coated beads than did strains which were coaggregation negative. Lactose (0.05 M) inhibited the attachment of those streptococcal strains which coaggregated with A. viscosus in a lactose-sensitive manner. The adherence of those streptococcal strains whose coaggregation appeared to depend upon the galactosyl-binding adhesin of A. viscosus was also reduced by components of human saliva. Crude sonic extracts of coaggregation-positive streptococci or of P. aeruginosa were also effective in aggregating Actinomyces cells. The effect of lactose and of salivary components on this extract-induced aggregation of Actinomyces cells generally paralleled that observed in other assays. The apparent prevalence and diversity of adherent reactions between the pathogens studied and indigenous strains of A. viscosus suggest that some may affect host susceptibility to these infectious agents.
TI  - Comparative opsonic activity of intravenous gamma globulin preparations for common bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Immune globulin intravenous is a reduced and alkylated preparation of gamma globulin that is stabilized in 10 percent maltose and 0.1 M glycine at pH 6.8. Recently, a modified immune globulin intravenous preparation was developed that is identical to the standard preparation except that it does not contain glycine and the pH has been lowered to 5.25. The effect of these modifications has resulted in a higher IgG monomer content in the preparation. In the present studies the opsonic activity against several common bacterial pathogens was assessed in the standard (pH 6.8) versus the more acidic immune globulin intravenous (pH 5.25). Opsonic activity was detected in each preparation for Staphylococcus aureus, group B streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens. With all of the organisms except S. marcescens, an intact complement system was required for optimal uptake and killing with each preparation. In general, the opsonic activity of the pH 5.25 immune globulin intravenous was equivalent to the standard pH 6.8 preparation. With several organisms, however, the more acidic preparation had greater activity than the standard one. An immune globulin intravenous preparation with increased antibody titers to P. aeruginosa was also prepared from selected donors and tested for opsonic activity against six of the seven Pseudomonas immunotypes. This preparation was found to have strikingly increased opsonic titers for most of the Pseudomonas immunotypes when compared with the standard immune globulin intravenous. These studies indicate that changes in donor selection or minor modifications in production techniques may markedly affect the biologic activity of intravenous gamma globulin.
TI  - Comparative anti-Pseudomonas aeruginosa activity of chemically modified and native immunoglobulin G (human), and potentiation of antibiotic protection against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and group B Streptococcus in vivo.
AB  - Immunoglobulin G intravenous is prepared by controlled reduction and alkylation of approximately four interheavy chain disulfide bonds per molecule. To determine if the protective activity of antibody modified by this process is diminished, mice were treated with identical doses of reduced and alkylated IgG and native IgG prepared from the same plasma pool. Three hours later mice were given a 10 percent body surface burn followed by challenge with the seven Fisher-Devlin-Gnabasik immunotypes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against five of the seven immunotypes, the 50 percent protective doses were approximately 100 mg or less per kg body weight. Overall there was no significant difference in protection afforded to the mice by the two immunoglobulin preparations indicating that in vivo the activity of IgG against P. aeruginosa remains unimpaired by reduction and alkylation. In the second part of this study, immunoglobulin G intravenous significantly enhanced the activity of tobramycin and carbenicillin in the treatment of P. aeruginosa infection in burned mice and of penicillin G in the treatment of group B Streptococcus 1C infection in normal mice.
TI  - Antibacterial monoclonal antibodies and the dawn of a new era in the control of infection.
AB  - Literature reports concerned with monoclonal antibodies against bacteria, or their toxins, which are pathogens for man and animals were surveyed. These antibodies have important potential uses in human and veterinary pathology and medicine. They are likely to become key elements in a fast progression toward a more complete understanding and control of infectious diseases and of toxin poisoning. A new area of bacteriology relevant to sanitary engineering is also being advanced with the help of antibacterial monoclonal antibodies. This area involves bacteria that produce the biofuel methane, along with other molecules of nutritional value, through a process which brings about the recycling of organic wastes and thereby limits or controls microbial contamination of soil and water.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of microbicidal cationic proteins 1 and 2, natural peptide antibiotics of rabbit lung macrophages.
AB  - Microbicidal cationic proteins 1 and 2, peptides derived from rabbit lung macrophages, were tested for bactericidal activity against various bacterial species. Both were highly active against diverse gram-positive and gram-negative organisms under conditions of near-neutral pH (between 7 and 8) and relatively low ionic strength. Susceptible species included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens. Streptococcus agalactiae, type 1A, was less susceptible than the aforementioned organisms or S. agalactiae, type 3. Bordetella bronchiseptica, a common commensal and pathogen of the rabbit respiratory tract, was completely resistant to both peptides.
TI  - Action of EDTA-Tris and antimicrobial agent combinations on selected pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The concentration of EDTA-Tris (3.22 mM EDTA and 0.05 M Tris) used as a lavage to treat otitis externa, cystitis or other persistent infections in dogs and cats, was found to prevent the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and beta streptococci when present in growth media. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was rapidly lysed in this solution. Escherichia coli and Proteus vulgaris grew in the presence of EDTA-Tris, but to a lesser extent than the controls without these compounds. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for 8 antimicrobial agents with and without EDTA-Tris were determined for E. coli and P. vulgaris. A potentiation effect on E. coli (greater than 50% decrease MIC) was observed when EDTA-Tris was combined with penicillin, oxytetracycline or chloramphenicol. A similar effect was observed with P. vulgaris when combinations of EDTA-Tris plus gentamicin, oxytetracycline, polymyxin-B or triple sulfa were used. The results of this study indicate that EDTA-Tris appears to have merit in selected cases of otitis externa, cystitis or other persistent infections where lavage might be used.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide-mediated antagonism against serratia marcescens by Streptococcus mitis.
AB  - The alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus mitis strain no. 17-1, isolated from the oral cavity of an healthy female adult, antagonized the growth of all 24 test strains of Serratia marcescens examined; furthermore, this strain inhibited the growth of various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae. However, strans of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved refractory. The mechanism of microbial antagonism was due to production and release of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic atmospheric conditions, which was neutralized through incorporation of bovine liver catalase into the solid assay medium.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - The growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. fecalis, S. sanguis, S. bovis, S. mitior, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli, A-D group, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Pasteurella multocida or Listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. Two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. The analysis detected the growth of S. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and species of Micrococcus, Corynebacterium or Bacillus in 18 blood cultures.
TI  - Rapid methods for identification of common clinical isolates.
AB  
TI  - In vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  - Norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. We examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including anaerobic species. It inhibited 90% (MIC90) of strains of Escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, Klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Salmonella and Shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, Citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, Enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and Enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. The MICs of Proteus mirabilis, Morganella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Proteus rettgeri, and Providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 of Serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of Acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa the MIC50, the MIC75, and the MIC90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC50 of Pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the MIC90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. Yersinia, Arizona, and Aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was Campylobacter. The activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the MIC90s of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. All Listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. The activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, pH, or inoculum size. There was no major difference between MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration values. Norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.
TI  - Effects of washing on the bacterial flora of the stallion's penis.
AB  - Six stallions were subjected to extensive cleansing of the penis and prepuce with water, Ivory Soap and water, or Betadine surgical scrub and water. The stallions were all washed for 14 days, and then allowed 14 days respite. This pattern of washing and resting was repeated consecutively. Swabs were taken from all 7 stallions twice weekly and semen was collected once a week for bacteriological examination. All forms of cleansing altered the bacterial flora of the stallion's penis; the Ivory Soap tended to encourage the replacement of the normal flora with coliform organisms, while Betadine favoured the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella spp. This experiment showed that the systematic washing of a stallion's penis will cause the normal flora to be replaced with pathogens and potential pathogens.
TI  - Intravenous cefotaxime in children with bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Thirteen children with meningitis due to Haemophilus influenzae, beta-haemolytic  streptococcus group B, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Neisseria meningitidis, Escherichia coli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa and who had been unsuccessfully treated with other antibiotics or had causative organisms which were resistant to available antibiotics were treated with intravenous cefotaxime. Nine children were cured; in one case infection (with a different organism) recurred but a further course of cefotaxime was successful; one child died, with sterile CSF; one child died from his underlying disease (astrocytoma); and one child was cured with sequelae (hydrocephalus). A further child with meningitis caused by E. coli had been treated unsuccessfully by intravenous and intraventricular chloramphenicol and gentamicin; intravenous and intraventricular cefotaxime was successful. The agent was well tolerated. CSF levels were measured in seven children and ranged from 300 to 27 200 microgram/l; published and unpublished in-vitro studies suggest that minimum inhibitory concentrations for cefotaxime against the organisms commonly causing bacterial meningitis are usually well below 250 microgram/l.
TI  - [Clinical differentiation between idiopathic respiratory distress, neonatal septicemia caused by group B streptococci and septicemia caused by other pathogens (author's transl)].
AB  - Since bacterial infection in newborns must be treated as specifically and as early as possible, it is important to confirm a diagnosis of suspected infection based on clinical symptoms and to take possible pathogens into consideration when choosing therapy. RDS and septicemia with Group B streptococci can present very similar clinical symptoms, but leucopenia on the first day of life is most probably an indication of septicemia with Group B streptococci. Septicemia caused by other pathogens, however, usually has a much later onset. In the days following birth a raised cardiothoracic index indicates RDS. Other differential criteria are being investigated.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY127935.
AB  - LY127935 is a unique new beta-lactam antibiotic. Its activity against 536 clinical isolates was studied by using microdilution methods of susceptibility testing and compared with the activities of cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cephalothin. The lowest concentrations required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (MIC(90)s) of LY127935 for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae ranged from 2 to 8 mug/ml. The MIC(90)s for other staphylococci and streptococci were higher. The MIC(90)s for Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas species ranged from 0.12 to 8 mug/ml and 8 to >32 mug/ml, respectively. The MIC(90)s for anaerobes ranged from 2 to >32 mug/ml. As determined by MIC(90)s, LY127935 was consistently the least active antibiotic against facultatively anaerobic gram-positive cocci and the most active against aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. Its position with respect to activity against anaerobes varied from being the most active against Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens to the least active against anaerobic cocci. In a population of multidrug-resistant isolates, concentrations of 8 mug or less of LY127935 per ml inhibited 82% of Enterobacteriaceae; concentrations of 32 mug or less per ml inhibited 100% of Enterobacteriaceae and 40% of P. aeruginosa. Increasing the inoculum size by 100-fold did not increase the minimal inhibitory concentrations of LY127935 or cefoxitin but did increase minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefamandole and cephalothin for some Enterobacteriaceae. All four drugs were bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations were the same or one concentration higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations for 91 to 96% of strains tested. The broad spectrum and marked in vitro activity of LY127935 make it a promising new antibiotic.
TI  - Detection of experimental bacteremia and fungemia by examination of buffy coat prepared by a micromethod.
AB  - Rabbits received intravenous injections of bacteria or fungi, and a comparison was made of the abilities of broth cultures, plating after dilution either in saline solution or in distilled water containing Triton X-100, and buffy coat examinations to detect the organisms in heart blood. The most sensitive method was broth culture. By microscopy or subculture of buffy coat cells prepared by centrifugation of blood in microhematocrit tubes, organisms were rapidly and regularly detected when their viable counts increased to 300--1,000/ml as detected by plating. By micromodification, buffy coat examination is technically easy to perform, and the method is only slightly less sensitive than when a larger amount of blood is used. Thus, it would be ideal for rapid provisional diagnosis of sepsis in patients, e.g., neonates, when the use of only a small blood sample is preferred.
TI  - [Microbial etiology of subclinical bovine mastitis in the Santa Fe dairy basin].
AB  - A study of 320 samples of mammary quarters from cows in 40 dairy farms around Santa Fe city during 1977-1978 was made. The samples were selected based on clinical examination and California Mastitis Test (GMT). High percentage of subclinical mastitis was found. The etiological agents most frequently isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (54,1%), Streptococcus agalactiae (23.4%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13,2%). A winter increment of S. aureus (48,1%) and P. aeruginosa (3,7% and 22,5%) was observed. But S. agalactiae did not experiment considerable variation (26,8% and 20% throughout the year. The sensitivity to antibiotics of some strains decreased in winter specially in S. aureus and P. aeruginosa (61,5% and 38,9%), and some biochemical properties related with their virulence increased. Penicillin in milk was not detected, but the levels of contamination by non specific inhibitory substances were very high (40%). Besides it was found a great contamination with aerobic sporeforming bacteria in these samples, being Bacillus coagulans (59,1%), B. polymyxa (26,1%) and B. sphaericus (9,5%) the most frequent.
TI  - Hygiene in the prevention of udder infections. IV. Evaluation of teat dips with excised cows' teats.
AB  - Suspensions of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used to contaminate teats excised from cows. Commercially available teat dips were applied for evaluation of comparative germicidal activity. Iodophors, sodium hypochlorite, and sodium dichloro-s-triazenetrione were highly effective against all four test organisms. Quarternary ammonium, chlorhexidine, and cetylpyridinium chloride were effective against Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae but not Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bronopol and 8-hydroxyquinoline sulfate were marginally effective on the two Gram positive organisms and ineffective on the two Gram negatives. Three of the dips were ineffective against all four pathogens; two were in nonaqueous bases, and the other was a blend of pine oil and antibodies with udder origin. In other trials, iodophor at .3% titratable iodine was highly effective against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae. Products containing .5 and 1% iodophor maintained effectiveness after each was used to dip 140 teats under conditions of commercial dairying. Logarithmic reduction in the geometric mean number of organisms recovered from teats was more meaningful for evaluating data than percent reduction.
TI  - Pathogenesis of bacteremia due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cyclophosphamide-treated mice and potentiation of virulence of endogenous streptococci.
AB  - Mice treated with cyclophosphamide on day 0 were killed at sequential intervals during subsequent administration of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in drinking water and were examined for sites of bacterial colonization and multiplication with use of peroxidase-labeled antibody and culture techniques. These studies were coordinated with those of clinical and histopathologic changes. Bacterial antigen was first detected on day 4 on the surface of nasal squamocolumnar junctions and the stratum corneum of gingival sulci and crests. Invasion of tissue by P. aeruginosa proceeded rapidly from these sites and led to bacteremia. There was no invasion of the lower alimentary canal. Endogenous group B beta-hemolytic streptococci colonized and penetrated ulcers created by previous pseudomonas invasion. These results suggest that epithelial colonization is the critical event in the pathogenesis of bacteremia due to P. aeruginosa in the immunosuppressed host. The resulting infection may provide a conduit for invasion and enhancement of the virulence of endogenous streptococci.
TI  - Bacterial etiology of otitis media during the first six weeks of life.
AB  - Tympanocentesis was performed on 70 infants who had otitis media during the first six weeks of life. The bacteria isolated from their middle-ear effusions were Streptococcus pneumoniae (13 patients), Neisseria catarrhalis (11 patients), Hemophilus influenzae (ten patients), Enterobacteriaceae (four patients), Staphylococcus aureus (four patients), streptococci (groups A and B) (three patients), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (two patients). Thirty patients (42.9%) had middle-ear effusions which did not contain pathogenic bacteria. Twenty-seven infants were followed for at least 12 months and 12 (44.4%) of these infants had six or more episodes of otitis media during the observation period. Further studies will be needed to establish the significance of middle-ear disease at this age and the role of therapy in improving its outcome.
TI  - Ticarcillin: a collaborative in vitro comparison with carbenicillin against over  9,000 clinical bacterial isolates.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations of ticarcillin and carbenicillin were determined for 9,236 clinical bacterial isolates by the broth microdilution method at four participating laboratories. Ticarcillin showed significantly increased activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae (P less than .001), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P less than .001) and Aeromonas hydrophilia (P less than .005) when compared to carbenicillin, but no signifcant differences were observed against other gram-negative organisms. Ticarcillin was consistently less active against the gram-positive cocci, and these differences were significant for Staphylococcus aureus (P less than .001), Streptococcus agalactiae (P less than .001), Staphylococcus epidermidis (P less than .001) and Streptococcus viridans (P less than .005). Significant regional and institutional differences in susceptibility to the two drugs were observed for several species, including common nosocomial pathogens such as S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and Escherichia coli.
TI  - [Selective effect of propolis in the isolation of Listeria monocytogenes (author's transl)].
AB  - Propolis is a substance produced by honeybees. It is inhibitory to some bacteria  species, mainly Gram-positive bacteria, but less inhibitory to Listeria monocytogenes (L.m) than to the other Gram-positive bacteria tested. In order to obtain selective growth of L.m. from contaminated samples, the effect of propolis in plating media and broths on various strains of bacteria was examined. Table I shows the effect of increasing concentrations of propolis in tryptose-agar (TA). L.m. tolerated higher concentrations of propolis than Streptococcus viridans and Staphylococcus aureus. L.m. grew well in tryptosebroth (TB) that contained 0.15 mg propolis pr. ml medium, while Streptococcus viridans and Streptococcus agalactiae were completely inhibited as seen in Table II. Table III shows that when serum was added to the agar, the inhibitory effect was reduced. It can also be seen that Gram-negative bacteria grew quite well on media that contained 0.19 mg propolis pr. ml. To reduce the growth of Gram-negative bacteria, nalidixic acid was added to the medium. Table IV illustrates growth of various species of bacteria in tryptosephosphatebroth (TFB) with or without propolis and nalidixic acid. Most of the strains tested were inhibited, but Pseudomonas aeruginosa and to some extent faecal streptococci were able to grow in the medium that contained the selective substances. As a conclusion it seems that propolis may be a valuable additive to a medium for the selective isolation of L.m.
TI  - [Infective situation in a cow barn contaminated with Klebsiella mastitis].
AB  - The infection situation in a four-row cow-house for 153 animals with a frequent occurrence of Klebsiella mastitis was subject to a detailed analysis. The following results were obtained after two collections of blood and udder-quarter milk samples examined by the test-tube agglutination, gel precipitation, and bacteriological diagnosis methods: 1. Streptococcus agalactiae was isolated from milk samples 28 and 31 times, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 15 and 19 times, Staphylococcus arueus 16 and 19 times, Klebsiella pneumoniae 6 and 6 times, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus once and 4 times, Enterobacter aerogenes twice and three times, and Escherichia coli twice. The authors failed to determine the causative agent in 26--38 cows (20--30%) with a pathologically changed secretion. 2. Double test-tube agglutination performed in a 30-day interval revealed suspected Klebsiella antibodies having a titre of 80 + + and higher in 13 dairy cows (12%); However, the suspicion was disproved by the negative results of gel precipitation. 3. The final deduction concerning the exogenic character of Klebsiella mastitis should encourage efforts for good housing, due nutrition, efficacious disinfection, and hygienic milk production.
TI  - [Devitalizing effect of Jodonal A in vitro on bacteria subject to a short-term exposure].
AB  - In a three-minute exposure in vitro Jodonal A devitalized a culture of serological group B streptococci in a 2% concentration, Staphylococcus aureus in a 16% concentration, Pneumococcus in a 4.5% concentration, Corynebacterium pyogenes in a 2.5% concentration, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a 3% concentration, and Klebsiella pneumoniae in a 2% concentration. Hence Jodonal A concentrations higher than 16% should be tested for udder teat disinfection after the removal of teat cups.
TI  - [Determination of the effective concentration of Jodonal a for the disinfection of the skin and teats after milking].
AB  - The bactericidal effectivity of Jodonal A in 1:10, 1:5, and 1:3 solutions was tested on human skin and on the teats of cow mammary glands. The 1:3 dilution ratio proved best for three-minute exposure. Jodonal A used in this concentration in 522 cows for the post-milking disinfection of teats for 10 months exerted no harmful effect on the skin of the mammary glands.
TI  - Acute severe mastitis in cows of the Dutch-Friesian Breed (author's transl).
AB  - One hundred cases of severe acute mastitis are reported. Bacteriological examination of the milk was negative in 23% of the cases. E. coli was most frequently found to be the causative organism (23%), followed by St. aureus (19%), C. pyogenes (10%), Str. dysgalactiae (9%), Str. agalactiae (5%) and a number of other pathogenic agents such as atypical streptococci, Str. uberis, haemolytic streptococci, Aerobacter aerogenes, Kl. pneumoniae, a clostridium and P. multocida. In several cases, a tentative diagnosis may be based on the clinical symptoms, which is then found to be correct on bacteriological examination of the milk. The prognosis will vary with the causative organism. Treatment was life-saving in more than 90% of the cases, the milk-producing capacity of the affected quarter being completely preserved in 36% and partly preserved in 27% of the cases.
TI  - Meatal recolonization in bitches.
AB  - Colonization of the urethrovaginal area precedes urinary tract infection in women. Among the potential factors limiting colonization by fecal pathogens is bacterial interference, the ability of established commensals to inhibit colonization by pathogenic bacteria. Since the microcontour of the canine distal urethra possesses microvilli like those in the vagina rather than the microplicae found at higher levels and also has similarities in cellular glycogen content the meatal area would be expected to respond to hormonal influences like the vagina. The normal canine urethrovaginal flora was determined by serial cultures. It consisted principally of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium and Acinetobacter-Haemophilus. Estrus produced a selective overgrowth of beta-Streptococcus and Acinetobacter-Haemophilus. A normal canine transient, Escherichia coli, and a normal resident, Corynebacterium, persisted only for a short time (4.5 days) unless inoculated during estrus, when they remained for a mean period of 70 days. In contrast, human Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas persisted only a short time, whether during anestrus (4.8 days) or during estrus (8.5 days). The commensals had returned fully by 14 days after sterilization, while those in estrus overresponded. Thus, indigenous bacteria inhibit establishment of certain foreign species in the urethra and hormones enhance the susceptibility to colonization.
