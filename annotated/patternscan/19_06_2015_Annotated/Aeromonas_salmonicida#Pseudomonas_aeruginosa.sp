TI  == characterization of aeromonas hydrophila wound pathotypes by comparative genomic  and functional analyses of virulence genes.
AB  == aeromonas hydrophila has increasingly been implicated as a virulent and antibiotic-resistant etiologic agent in various human diseases. in a previously published case report, we described a subject with a polymicrobial wound infection that included a persistent and aggressive strain of a. hydrophila (e1), as well as a more antibiotic-resistant strain of a. hydrophila (e2). to better understand the differences between pathogenic and environmental strains of a. hydrophila, we conducted comparative genomic and functional analyses of virulence-associated genes of these two wound isolates (e1 and e2), the environmental type strain a. hydrophila atcc 7966(t), and four other isolates belonging to a. aquariorum, a. veronii, a. salmonicida, and a. caviae. full-genome sequencing of strains e1 and e2 revealed extensive differences between the two and strain atcc 7966(t). the more persistent wound infection strain, e1, harbored coding sequences for a cytotoxic enterotoxin (act), a type 3 secretion system (t3ss), flagella, hemolysins, and a homolog of exotoxin a found  in pseudomonas aeruginosa. corresponding phenotypic analyses with a. hydrophila atcc 7966(t) and ssu as reference strains demonstrated the functionality of these virulence genes, with strain e1 displaying enhanced swimming and swarming motility, lateral flagella on electron microscopy, the presence of t3ss effector  aexu, and enhanced lethality in a mouse model of aeromonas infection. by combining sequence-based analysis and functional assays, we characterized an a. hydrophila pathotype, exemplified by strain e1, that exhibited increased virulence in a mouse model of infection, likely because of encapsulation, enhanced motility, toxin secretion, and cellular toxicity. importance: aeromonas  hydrophila is a common aquatic bacterium that has increasingly been implicated in serious human infections. while many determinants of virulence have been identified in aeromonas, rapid identification of pathogenic versus nonpathogenic  strains remains a challenge for this genus, as it is for other opportunistic pathogens. this paper demonstrates, by using whole-genome sequencing of clinical  aeromonas strains, followed by corresponding virulence assays, that comparative genomics can be used to identify a virulent subtype of a. hydrophila that is aggressive during human infection and more lethal in a mouse model of infection.  this aggressive pathotype contained genes for toxin production, toxin secretion,  and bacterial motility that likely enabled its pathogenicity. our results highlight the potential of whole-genome sequencing to transform microbial diagnostics; with further advances in rapid sequencing and annotation, genomic analysis will be able to provide timely information on the identities and virulence potential of clinically isolated microorganisms.

TI  == contribution of type iv pili to the virulence of aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida in atlantic salmon (salmo salar l.).
AB  == aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, a bacterial pathogen of atlantic salmon, has no visible pili, yet its genome contains genes for three type iv pilus systems. one system, tap, is similar to the pseudomonas aeruginosa pil system, and a second, flp, resembles the actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans flp pilus, while the third has homology to the mannose-sensitive hemagglutinin pilus  of vibrio cholerae. the latter system is likely nonfunctional since eight genes,  including the gene encoding the main pilin subunit, are deleted compared with the orthologous v. cholerae locus. the first two systems were characterized to investigate their expression and role in pathogenesis. the pili of a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida were imaged using atomic force microscopy and tap- and flp-overexpressing strains. the tap pili appeared to be polar, while the flp pili appeared to be peritrichous. strains deficient in tap and/or flp were used in live bacterial challenges of atlantic salmon, which showed that the tap pilus made a moderate contribution to virulence, while the flp pilus made little or no  contribution. delivery of the tap mutant by immersion resulted in reduced cumulative morbidity compared with the cumulative morbidity observed with the wild-type strain; however, delivery by intraperitoneal injection resulted in cumulative morbidity similar to that of the wild type. unlike the pili of other piliated bacterial pathogens, a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida type iv pili are  not absolutely required for virulence in atlantic salmon. significant differences in the behavior of the two mutant strains indicated that the two pilus systems are not redundant.

TI  == function and molecular architecture of the yersinia injectisome tip complex.
AB  == by quantitative immunoblot analyses and scanning transmission electron microscopy (stem), we determined that the needle of the yersinia enterocolitica e40 injectisome consists of 139 +/- 19 yscf subunits and that the tip complex is formed by three to five lcrv monomers. a pentamer represented the best fit for an atomic model of this complex. the n-terminal globular domain of lcrv forms the base of the tip complex, while the central globular domain forms the head. hybrids between lcrv and its orthologues pcrv (pseudomonas aeruginosa) or acrv (aeromonas salmonicida) were engineered and recombinant y. enterocolitica expressing the different hybrids were tested for their capacity to form the translocation pore by a haemolysis assay. there was a good correlation between haemolysis, insertion of yopb into erythrocyte membranes and interaction between  yopb and the n-terminal globular domain of the tip complex subunit. hence, the base of the tip complex appears to be critical for the functional insertion of yopb into the host cell membrane.

TI  == further characterization of a type iii secretion system (t3ss) and of a new effector protein from a clinical isolate of aeromonas hydrophila--part i.
AB  == a type iii secretion system (t3ss)-associated cytotoxin, aext, with adp-ribosyltransferase activity and homology to pseudomonas aeruginosa bifuncational toxins exot/s, was recently identified from a fish pathogen aeromonas salmonicida. in this study, we reported the molecular characterization  of an aext-like toxin gene (designated as aexu) from a diarrheal isolate ssu of a. hydrophila. the aexu gene was 1539bp in length and encoded a protein of 512 amino acid (aa) residues. the nh(2)-terminus of aexu (aa residues 1-231) exhibited a 67% homology with the nh(2)-terminus of aext from a. salmonicida. importantly, its cooh-terminus (aa residues 232-512) had no homology with any known functional proteins in the database; however, the full-length aexu retained adp-ribosyltransferase activity. the expression and subsequent secretion of aexu  was t3ss dependent, as inactivation of the ascv gene that codes for an inner-membrane component of the t3ss channel from the wild-type (wt) bacterium, blocked translocation of aexu in ht-29 human colonic epithelial cells. we provided evidence that inactivation of acrv and axse genes (homologs of lcrv and  exse in yersinia species and p. aeruginosa, respectively) from a. hydrophila ssu, altered expression and/or secretion of aexu. we deleted an aexu gene from the wt, as well as from the deltaaopb mutant, of a. hydrophila, generating a single knockout (deltaaexu) and a double knockout mutant, deltaaopb/deltaaexu. increased phagocytosis was observed in raw264.7 murine macrophages infected with the deltaaopb/deltaaexu mutant, as compared to macrophages when infected with the parental deltaaopb strain. further, mice infected with the deltaaexu mutant had a 60% survival rate, compared to animals infected with the wt or the deltaaexu-complemented strain that caused 90-100% of the animals to die at a 2-3  ld(50s) dose. immunization of mice with the recombinant aexu protected them from  subsequent lethal challenge dose by the wt bacterium. finally, we detected specific anti-aexu antibodies in the sera of mice that survived challenge by the  wt bacterium, which may indicate that aexu plays an important role in the pathogenesis of aeromonas infections.

TI  == biological characterization of a new type iii secretion system effector from a clinical isolate of aeromonas hydrophila-part ii.
AB  == we recently identified a novel type iii secretion system (t3ss) effector, aexu, from a diarrheal isolate ssu of aeromonas hydrophila, and demonstrated that mice  infected with the deltaaexu mutant were significantly protected from mortality. although the nh(2)-terminal domain of this toxin exhibits homology to aext of a.  salmonicida, a fish pathogen, and exot/s of pseudomonas aeruginosa, the cooh-terminal domain of aexu is unique, with no homology to any known proteins in the ncbi database. in this study, we purified the full-length aexu and its nh(2)-terminal (amino acid residues 1-231) and cooh-terminal (amino acid residues 232-512) domains after expression of their corresponding genes in escherichia coli as histidine-tag fusion proteins using the bacteriophage t7 rna polymerase/promoter-based pet-30a vector system. the full-length and nh(2)- and cooh-terminal domains of aexu exhibited adp-ribosyltransferase activity, with the former two exhibiting much higher activity than the latter. these different forms of aexu were also successfully expressed and produced in the hela tet-off cell system using a pbi-egfp vector, as demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, western blot analysis, and intracellular staining of the toxin using flow cytometric analysis. production of aexu in hela cells resulted in possible actin reorganization and cell rounding, as determined by phalloidin staining and confocal microscopy. based on electron microscopy, the toxin also caused chromatin condensation, which is indicative of  apoptosis. apoptosis of hela cells expressing and producing aexu was confirmed by 7-amino actinomycin d (7-aad) and mtt [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl  tetrasodium bromide] assays, by detection of cytoplasmic histone-associated dna fragments, and by activation of caspases 3 and 9. these effects were much more pronounced in host cells that expressed and produced the full-length or nh(2)-terminal domain of aexu, compared to those that expressed and produced the  cooh-terminal domain or the vector alone. this study represents the first characterization of this novel t3ss effector.

TI  == occurrence of n-acyl-l-homoserine lactones in extracts of some gram-negative bacteria evaluated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
AB  == acylated homoserine lactones (ahls) are self-generated signal molecules that mediate population density-dependent gene expression (quorum sensing) in a variety of gram-negative bacteria. these signal molecules diffuse from bacterial  cells and accumulate in the medium as a function of cell growth. in selected foods ahls contribute to product spoilage. as different bacterial species produce ahl analogs that differ in length of the n-acyl chain, ranging from 4 to 14 carbons and in the substitution at the c-3 position of the side chain (i.e., oxo  or hydroxyl group), the suitability and applicability of a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry direct method for characterizing trace amounts of ahls was evaluated using n-heptanoyl-homoserine lactone as internal standard.  crude cell-free supernatants of bacterial cultures of aeromonas hydrophila, aeromonas salmonicida, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, yersinia  enterocolitica, and serratia liquefaciens were screened for ahl production in selected ion monitoring mode, using the prominent fragment at m/z 143. the observed profiles of distinguishable n-acyl-homoserine lactones occurring in bacterial extracts were compared and discussed. the presence of a labile 3-oxo-hexanoylhomoserine lactone was evidenced but serious difficulties arose in  estimating its concentration as thermal degradation occurs during the gas chromatographic separation. its electron impact mass spectra was, however, given  and interpreted.

TI  == characterization of a type iii secretion substrate specificity switch (t3s4) domain in yscp from yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == the length of the needle ending the yersinia ysc injectisome is determined by yscp, a protein acting as a molecular ruler. in addition, yscp is required for yop secretion. in the present paper, by a systematic deletion analysis, we localized accurately the region required for yop secretion between residues 405 and 500. as this c-terminal region of yscp has also been shown to control needle  length it probably represents the substrate specificity switch of the machinery.  by a bioinformatics analysis, we show that this region has a globular structure,  an original alpha/beta fold, a p-x-l-g signature and presumably no catalytic activity. in spite of very limited sequence similarities, this structure is conserved among the proteins that are presumed to control the needle length in many different injectisomes and also among members of the flik family, which control the flagellar hook length. this region thus represents a new protein domain that we called t3s4 for type iii secretion substrate specificity switch. the t3s4 domain of yscp can be replaced by the t3s4 domain of ascp (aeromonas salmonicida) or pscp (pseudomonas aeruginosa) but not by the one from flik, indicating that in spite of a common global structure, these domains need to fit  their partner proteins in the secretion apparatus.

TI  == an aeromonas salmonicida type iv pilin is required for virulence in rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss.
AB  == aeromonas salmonicida expresses a large number of proven and suspected virulence  factors including bacterial surface proteins, extracellular degradative enzymes,  and toxins. we report the isolation and characterization of a 4-gene cluster, tapabcd, from virulent a. salmonicida a450 that encodes proteins homologous to components required for type iv pilus biogenesis. one gene, tapa, encodes a protein with high homology to type iv pilus subunit proteins from many gram-negative bacterial pathogens, including aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio vulnificus. a survey of a. salmonicida isolates from a variety of sources shows that the tapa gene is as ubiquitous in this species as it is in other members of the aeromonads. immunoblotting experiments demonstrate  that it is expressed in vitro and is antigenically conserved among the a. salmonicida strains tested. a mutant a. salmonicida strain defective in expression of tapa was constructed by allelic exchange and found to be slightly less pathogenic for juvenile oncorhynchus mykiss (rainbow trout) than wild type when delivered by intraperitoneal injection. in addition, fish initially challenged with a high dose of wild type were slightly more resistant to rechallenge with wild type than those initially challenged with the tapa mutant strain, suggesting that presence of tapa contributes to immunity. two of the other three genes identified, tapb and tapc, encode proteins with homology to factors known to be required for type iv pilus assembly in p. aeruginosa, but in  an as yet unidentified manner. tapb is a member of the abc-transporter family of  proteins that contain characteristic nucleotide-binding regions, and which may provide energy for type iv pilus assembly through the hydrolysis of atp. tapc homologs are integral cytoplasmic membrane proteins that may play a role in pilus anchoring or initiation of assembly. the fourth gene, tapd, encodes a product that shares homology with a family of proteins with a known biochemical function, namely, the type iv prepilin leader peptidases. these bifunctional enzymes proteolytically cleave the leader peptide from the pilin precursor (prepilin) and then n-methylate the newly exposed n-terminal amino acid prior to assembly of the subunits into the pilus structure. we demonstrate that a. salmonicida tapd is able to restore type iv pilus assembly and type ii secretion in a p. aeruginosa strain carrying a mutation in its type iv peptidase gene, suggesting that it plays the same role in a. salmonicida.

TI  == characterization of an adp-ribosyltransferase toxin (aext) from aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida.
AB  == an adp-ribosylating toxin named aeromonas salmonicida exoenzyme t (aext) in a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, the etiological agent of furunculosis in fish, was characterized. gene aext, encoding toxin aext, was cloned and characterized by sequence analysis. aext shows significant sequence similarity to the exos and  exot exotoxins of pseudomonas aeruginosa and to the yope cytotoxin of different yersinia species. the aext gene was detected in all of the 12 a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida strains tested but was absent from all other aeromonas species. recombinant aext produced in escherichia coli possesses enzymatic adp-ribosyltransferase activity. monospecific polyclonal antibodies directed against purified recombinant aext detected the toxin produced by a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida and cross-reacted with exos and exot of p. aeruginosa. aext toxin could be detected in a wild type (wt) strain of a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida freshly isolated from a fish with furunculosis; however, its expression required contact with rtg-2 rainbow trout gonad cells. under these conditions, the aext protein was found to be intracellular or tightly cell associated. no aext was found when a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida was incubated in cell culture medium in the absence of rtg-2 cells. upon infection with wt a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, the fish gonad rtg-2 cells rapidly underwent significant morphological changes. these changes were demonstrated to constitute cell rounding, which accompanied induction of production of aext and which led to cell lysis after extended incubation. an aext mutant which was constructed from the wt strain with an insertionally inactivated aext gene by allelic exchange had no toxic effect on rtg-2 cells and was devoid of aext production. hence aext is directly involved in the toxicity of a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida for rtg-2 fish cells.

TI  == a major secreted elastase is essential for pathogenicity of aeromonas hydrophila.
AB  == aeromonas hydrophila is an opportunistic pathogen and the leading cause of fatal  hemorrhagic septicemia in rainbow trout. a gene encoding an elastolytic activity, ahyb, was cloned from aeromonas hydrophila ag2 into puc18 and expressed in escherichia coli and in the nonproteolytic species aeromonas salmonicida subsp. masoucida. nucleotide sequence analysis of the ahyb gene revealed an open reading frame of 1,764 nucleotides with coding capacity for a 588-amino-acid protein with a molecular weight of 62,728. the first 13 n-terminal amino acids of the purified protease completely match those deduced from dna sequence starting at aag (lys-184). this finding indicated that ahyb is synthesized as a preproprotein with a 19-amino-acid signal peptide, a 164-amino-acid n-terminal propeptide, and  a 405-amino-acid intermediate which is further processed into a mature protease and a c-terminal propeptide. the protease hydrolyzed casein and elastin and showed a high sequence similarity to other metalloproteases, especially with the  mature form of the pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase (52% identity), helicobacter pylori zinc metalloprotease (61% identity), or proteases from several species of  vibrio (52 to 53% identity). the gene ahyb was insertionally inactivated, and the construct was used to create an isogenic ahyb mutant of a. hydrophila. these first reports of a defined mutation in an extracellular protease of a. hydrophila demonstrate an important role in pathogenesis.

TI  == identification and molecular characterization of two tandemly located flagellin genes from aeromonas salmonicida a449.
AB  == two tandemly located flagellin genes, flaa and flab, with 79% nucleotide sequence identity were identified in aeromonas salmonicida a449. the fla genes are conserved in typical and atypical strains of a. salmonicida, and they display significant divergence at the nucleotide level from the fla genes of the motile species aeromonas hydrophila and aeromonas veronii biotype sobria. flaa and flab  encode unprocessed flagellins with predicted mrs of 32,351 and 32,056, respectively. when cloned under the control of the ptac promoter, flab was highly expressed when induced in escherichia coli dh5alpha, and the flab protein was detectable even in the uninduced state. in flaa clones containing intact upstream sequence, flaa was barely detectable when uninduced and poorly expressed on induction. the a. salmonicida flagellins are antigenically cross-reactive with the a. hydrophila tf7 flagellin(s) and evolutionarily closely related to the flagellins of pseudomonas aeruginosa and vibrio anguillarum. electron microscopy  showed that a. salmonicida a449 expresses unsheathed polar flagella at an extremely low frequency under normal laboratory growth conditions, suggesting the presence of a full complement of genes whose products are required to make flagella; e.g., immediately downstream of flaa and flab are open reading frames encoding flag and flah homologs.

TI  == freeze-substitution of gram-negative eubacteria: general cell morphology and envelope profiles.
AB  == freeze-substitution was performed on strains of escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, campylobacter fetus, vibrio cholerae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, aeromonas salmonicida, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus pleuropneumoniae, caulobacter crescentus, and leptothrix discophora with a substitution medium composed of 2% osmium tetroxide and 2% uranyl acetate in anhydrous acetone. a thick periplasmic gel ranging from 10.6 to 14.3 nm in width  was displayed in e. coli k-12, k30, and his 1 (a k-12 derivative containing the k30 capsule genes), p. multocida, c. fetus, p. putida, a. salmonicida, h. pleuropneumoniae, and p. mirabilis. the other bacteria possessed translucent periplasms in which a thinner peptidoglycan layer was seen. capsular polysaccharide, evident as electron-dense fibers radiating outward perpendicular  to the cell surface, was observed on e. coli k30 and his 1 and p. mirabilis cells. a more random arrangement of fibers forming a netlike structure was apparent surrounding cells of h. pleuropneumoniae. for the first time a capsule,  distinct from the sheath, was observed on l. discophora. in all instances, capsular polysaccharide was visualized in the absence of stabilizing agents such  as homologous antisera or ruthenium red. other distinct envelope structures were  observed external to the outer membrane including the sheath of l. discophora and the s layers of a. salmonicida a450 and c. crescentus cb15a. we believe that the  freeze-substitution technique presents a more accurate image of the structural organization of these cells and that it has revealed complex ultrastructural relationships between cell envelope constituents previously difficult to visualize by more conventional means of preparation.

TI  == interaction of pseudomonas and enterobacteriaceae plasmids in aeromonas salmonicida.
AB  == we observed that aeromonas salmonicida aro200 will maintain either or both the pseudomonas r-factor, pmg1, and enterobacteriaceae r-factors. this bacterial strain, therefore, provides a unique background wherein the host ranges of pseudomonas and enterobacteriaceae plasmods overlap. co-maintenance of these plasmids resulted in behavior of plasmid aggregates that allowed transfer of r-dterminants beyond the host range of the parent plasmid. we observed that the aro200 genetic background facilitated the redistribution of b determinants among  unrelated and conjugally noninterfertile gram-negative bacteria. aberrant behavior resulting in the deletion of r-determinants for plasmids singly maintained in aro200 was also observed. plasmids studied included rp1, r702, incp; rs-a, incw; r192.7, incfii; r64-11, inci; r390, incn; and r6k, incx.
