TI  == [colonization of porphyromonas endodontalis in primary and secondary endodontic infections].
AB  == objective: this study aims to assess and compare the prevalence of porphyromonas  endodontalis (p. endodontalis) in root canals associated with primary and secondary endodontic infections by using 16s rdna pcr and real-time fluorescence  quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rtfq-pcr). methods: a total of 120 adult  patients with one radiographically documented periapical lesion were included. sixty teeth presented with primary endodontic infections and 60 with secondary endodontic infections requiring retreatment. p. endodontalis was identified by using 16s rdna pcr techniques. the positive dna expression of p. endodontalis in  two types of infected root canals were quantitatively compared by using sybr green i rtfq-pcr. results: the prevalence of p. endodontalis in the root canals with primary endodontic infections was significantly higher than that in root canals with secondary endodontic infections (p = 0.001). however, rtfq-pcr results showed no significant difference in dna expression quantities between the primary and secondary endodontic infections root canals (p = 0.303). conclusion:  p. endodontalis is more highly associated with root canals having primary endodontic infections, although p. endodontalis colonize in both root canals with primary and secondary chronic apical periodontitis.

TI  == [study of association between parvimonas micra and pulp dominant pathogens in the infected root canals with chronic periradicular periodontitis].
AB  == objective: to study the prevalence of parvimonas micra (pm) and the associations  between pm and pulp dominant pathogens in order to reflect the colonization of pm in the infected root canals with chronic periradicular periodontitis. methods: a  total of 120 teeth diagnosed as chronic periradicular periodontitis from 104 patients were included into the study. the teeth were allocated into untreated (primary infectious) and root-canal- treated (secondary infectious) groups with 60 in either group. samples were collected from the root canals using sterile files and paper points, and subsequent extraction of bacterial dna was undertaken. the pm 16s rdna level was evaluated using 16s rdna pcr. the prevalence of pm in chronic periradicular periodontitis was determined accordingly. then, the associations of pm and enterococcus faecalis (ef), porphyromonas endodontalis (pe) as well as porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) were analysed. results: pm was detected in 40% (24/60) of the samples from the primary infectious group, 5% (3/60) from the secondary infectious group. the prevalences  of pm from the two groups were different significantly (chi(2) = 21.06, p < 0.05). significant correlations (untreated group or = 5.98, root-canal-treated group or = 33.50) between pm and pe were identified in both groups, while the correlations between pm and pg as well as ef were not of significance, respectively. conclusions: a significantly higher relevance ratio of pm was estimated in the primary infectious group than the secondary infectious one. pm and pe were correlated significantly in the infected root canals, suggesting a symbiotic relation between these two bacteria.

TI  == salivary microbiota and metabolome associated with celiac disease.
AB  == this study aimed to investigate the salivary microbiota and metabolome of 13 children with celiac disease (cd) under a gluten-free diet (treated celiac disease [t-cd]). the same number of healthy children (hc) was used as controls. the salivary microbiota was analyzed by an integrated approach using culture-dependent and -independent methods. metabolome analysis was carried out by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-solid-phase microextraction. compared to  hc, the number of some cultivable bacterial groups (e.g., total anaerobes) significantly (p < 0.05) differed in the saliva samples of the t-cd children. as  shown by community-level catabolic profiles, the highest shannon's diversity and  substrate richness were found in hc. pyrosequencing data showed the highest richness estimator and diversity index values for hc. levels of lachnospiraceae,  gemellaceae, and streptococcus sanguinis were highest for the t-cd children. streptococcus thermophilus levels were markedly decreased in t-cd children. the saliva of t-cd children showed the largest amount of bacteroidetes (e.g., porphyromonas sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, and prevotella nanceiensis), together with the smallest amount of actinobacteria. t-cd children were also characterized by decreased levels of some actinomyces species, atopobium species, and corynebacterium durum. rothia mucilaginosa was the only actinobacteria species found at the highest level in t-cd children. as shown by multivariate statistical analyses, the levels of organic volatile compounds markedly differentiated t-cd children. some compounds (e.g., ethyl-acetate, nonanal, and 2-hexanone) were found to be associated with t-cd children. correlations (false discovery rate [fdr], <0.05) were found between the relative abundances of bacteria and some volatile organic compounds (vocs). the findings of this study indicated that cd is associated with oral dysbiosis that could affect the oral metabolome.

TI  == assessing the oral microbiota of healthy and alcohol-treated rats using whole-genome dna probes from human bacteria.
AB  == objective: this study aimed to evaluate the capacity of whole-genome dna probes prepared from human oral bacteria to cross-react with bacteria from the oral cavity of rats, and to assess the influence of alcohol ingestion on the animals'  oral biofilm. design: twenty four mature wistar rats were equally divided in two  groups. one group (control) was fed balanced diet of rat pellets and water. the alcohol-treated group (at) received the same diet and 20% ethanol solution. upon  euthanasia after 30 days, bacterial samples from the oral biofilm covering the animals' teeth were collected using microbrushes. bacteria identification and quantification were performed using the dna checkerboard hybridization method with 33 probes prepared from human oral bacteria. signals corresponding to bacterial genome counts and percentages were compared using a mann-whitney u test with a significance level <0.05. results: cross-reaction for all targeted species, except streptococcus mutans and streptococcus mitis-like species, occurred in the control group. escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, porphyromonas endodontalis, and veillonella parvula-like species only produced detectable signals in the at group. significantly more signals were detected in the control group compared to the at group (p=0.001). the percentage of e. coli-like species was highest in both groups. conclusions: whole-genome dna probes prepared from human oral bacteria can cross-react with rats' oral bacterial species. alcohol consumption is associated with lower levels and diversity of bacterial species in the oral cavity of rats.

TI  == comparison of endotoxin levels found in primary and secondary endodontic infections.
AB  == introduction: this clinical study was conducted to compare the levels of endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides [lpss]) found in primary and secondary endodontic infections with apical periodontitis by correlating lps contents with clinical/radiographic findings. in addition, the presence of target gram-negative anaerobic bacteria was also investigated. methods: samples were taken from 15 root canals with primary infections and 15 with secondary infections by using paper points. the limulus amebocyte lysate assay was used to quantify endotoxins, and the polymerase chain reaction technique (16s rdna) was used for bacterial investigation. results: endotoxins were detected in 100% of the root canal samples collected from primary (15/15) and secondary (15/15) infections with median values of 7.49 eu/ml and 3.96 eu/ml, respectively (p < .05). the median value of endotoxins found in the presence of clinical symptoms was significantly  higher than in asymptomatic teeth with primary infections (p < .05). a positive correlation was found between endotoxin contents and a larger size of the radiolucent area (>3 mm) (p < .05). prevotella nigrescens (10/15, 4/15), fusobacterium nucleatum (5/15, 1/15), treponema denticola (3/15, 1/15), and treponema socranskii (5/15, 1/15) were detected in teeth with primary and secondary infections, respectively. p. endodontalis was present only in teeth with primary infections (5/15). conclusions: teeth with primary endodontic infections had higher contents of endotoxins and a more complex gram-negative bacterial community than teeth with secondary infections. moreover, the levels of endotoxins were related to the severity of bone destruction in periapical tissues as well as the development of clinical features in teeth with primary infections.

TI  == detection of porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella  intermedia in primary endodontic infections in a chinese population.
AB  == aim: to assess the prevalence of three black-pigmented bacterial species (porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia)  using microarray technology in root canals of teeth associated with primary endodontic infections in a chinese population. methodology: microbial samples were taken from root canals of 80 teeth with pulp necrosis and primary endodontic infections in a chinese population. dna extracted from the samples was amplified  by pcr with universal bacterial primers based on 16s rrna gene sequences, and the products hybridized with the microarrays in which the specific oligonucleotide probes were added. the results of hybridization were screened by a confocal laser scanner. pearson chi-square test and the two-sided fisher exact test were used to analyse whether a significant association existed between the species and symptoms as well as in co-existence of two target organisms by a statistical software package (sas 8.02). results: the 16s rrna gene microarray detected at least one of the three test species in 76% of the study teeth. p. endodontalis, p. gingivalis and p. intermedia were found in 50%, 33% and 45%, respectively. a significant association was found in the presence of the pair p. endodontalis / p. gingivalis (p < 0.005). both p. endodontalis (p <0.05) and p. gingivalis (p <0.005) had a statistically significant association with the presence of a sinus  tract. the simultaneous presence of p. endodontalis and p. gingivalis was also associated with the presence of a sinus tract (p<0.005) and abscess formation (p<0.05). conclusions: the three black-pigmented bacteria were prevalent in teeth with pulp necrosis and primary endodontic infections in a chinese population. p.  gingivalis and p. endodontalis were associated with the presence of sinus tract and abscess formation.

TI  == molecular methods for diagnosis of odontogenic infections.
AB  == purpose: historically, the identification of microorganisms has been limited to species that could be cultured in the microbiology laboratory. the purpose of the present study was to apply molecular techniques to identify microorganisms in orofacial odontogenic infections (ois). materials and methods: specimens were obtained from subjects with clinical evidence of oi. to identify the microorganisms involved, 16s rrna sequencing methods were used on clinical specimens. the name and number of the clones of each species identified and the combinations of species present were recorded for each subject. descriptive statistics were computed for the study variables. results: specimens of pus or wound fluid were obtained from 9 subjects. a mean of 7.4 +/- 3.7 (standard deviation) species per case were identified. the predominant species detected in  the present study that have previously been associated with ois were fusobacterium spp, parvimonas micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, and prevotella oris. the predominant species detected in our study that have not been previously associated with ois were dialister pneumosintes and eubacterium brachy. unculturable phylotypes accounted for 24% of the species identified in our study. all species detected were obligate or facultative anaerobes. streptococci were not detected. conclusions: molecular methods have enabled us to detect previously cultivated and not-yet-cultivated species in ois; these methods could change our  understanding of the pathogenic flora of orofacial ois.

TI  == molecular analysis of 16s rrna genes identifies potentially periodontal pathogenic bacteria and archaea in the plaque of partially erupted third molars.
AB  == purpose: small subunit rrna sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were used to identify cultivable and uncultivable microorganisms present in the dental plaque  of symptomatic and asymptomatic partially erupted third molars to determine the prevalence of putative periodontal pathogens in pericoronal sites. materials and  methods: template dna prepared from subgingival plaque collected from partially erupted symptomatic and asymptomatic mandibular third molars and healthy incisors was used in polymerase chain reaction with broad-range oligonucleotide primers to amplify 16s rrna bacterial and archaeal genes. amplicons were cloned, sequenced,  and compared with known nucleotide sequences in online databases to identify the  microorganisms present. results: two thousand three hundred two clones from the plaque of 12 patients carried bacterial sequences from 63 genera belonging to 11  phyla, including members of the uncultivable tm7, sr1, and chloroflexi, and difficult-to-cultivate synergistetes and spirochaetes. dialister invisus, filifactor alocis, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella denticola, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola, which have been associated with periodontal disease, were found in significantly greater abundance in pericoronal compared with incisor sites. dialister invisus and f nucleatum were found in greater abundance in sites exhibiting clinical symptoms.  the archaeal species, methanobrevibacter oralis, which has been associated with severe periodontitis, was found in 3 symptomatic patients. conclusions: these findings have provided new insights into the complex microbiota of pericoronitis. several bacterial and archaeal species implicated in periodontal disease were recovered in greater incidence and abundance from the plaque of partially erupted third molars compared with incisors, supporting the hypothesis that the pericoronal region may provide a favored niche for periodontal pathogens in otherwise healthy mouths.

TI  == impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n  = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after  treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in  rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203,  pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia  dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated  with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI  == gingival fluid cytokine expression and subgingival bacterial counts during pregnancy and postpartum: a case series.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to assess gingival fluid (gcf) cytokine messenger rna (mrna) levels, subgingival bacteria, and clinical periodontal conditions during a normal pregnancy to postpartum. materials and methods: subgingival bacterial samples were analyzed with the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. gcf samples were assessed with real-time pcr including five proinflammatory cytokines and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor. results: nineteen pregnant women with a mean age of 32 years (s.d. +/- 4 years, range 26-42) participated in the study. full-mouth bleeding scores (bop) decreased from an average of 41.2% (s.d. +/- 18.6%) at the 12th week of pregnancy to 26.6% (s.d. +/- 14.4%) at the 4-6 weeks postpartum (p < 0.001). between week 12 and 4-6 weeks postpartum, the mean probing pocket depth changed from 2.4 mm (s.d. +/- 0.4) to 2.3 mm (s.d. +/- 0.3) (p = 0.34). higher counts of eubacterium saburreum, parvimonas micra, selenomonas noxia, and staphylococcus aureus were found at week 12 of pregnancy than at the 4-6 weeks postpartum examinations (p < 0.001). during and after pregnancy, statistically significant correlations between bop scores and bacterial counts were observed. bop scores and gcf levels of selected cytokines were not related to each other and no differences in gcf levels of the  cytokines were observed between samples from the 12th week of pregnancy to 4-6 weeks postpartum. decreasing postpartum counts of porphyromonas endodontalis and  pseudomonas aeruginosa were associated with decreasing levels of il-8 and il-1beta. conclusions: bop decreased after pregnancy without any active periodontal therapy. associations between bacterial counts and cytokine levels varied greatly in pregnant women with gingivitis and a normal pregnancy outcome.  postpartum associations between gcf cytokines and bacterial counts were more consistent. clinical relevance: combined assessments of gingival fluid cytokines  and subgingival bacteria may provide important information on host response.

TI  == impact of supragingival therapy on subgingival microbial profile in smokers versus non-smokers with severe chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to assess subgingival microbiological changes in smokers versus non-smokers presenting severe chronic periodontitis after supragingival periodontal therapy (st). methods: non-smokers (n=10) and smokers (n=10) presenting at least nine teeth with probing pocket depth (ppd) (>/=5 mm), bleeding on probing (bop), and no history of periodontal treatment in  the last 6 months were selected. clinical parameters assessed were plaque index (pi), bop, ppd, relative gingival margin position (rgmp) and relative clinical attachment level (rcal). subgingival biofilm was collected before and 21 days after st. dna was extracted and the 16s rrna gene was amplified with the universal primer pair, 27f and 1492r. amplified genes were cloned, sequenced, and identified by comparison with known 16s rrna sequences. statistical analysis was  performed by student's t and chi-square tests (alpha=5%). results: clinically, st promoted a significant reduction in pi and ppd, and gain of rcal for both groups, with no significant intergroup difference. microbiologically, at baseline, data analysis demonstrated that smokers harbored a higher proportion of porphyromonas  endodontalis, bacteroidetes sp., fusobacterium sp. and tannerella forsythia and a lower number of cultivated phylotypes (p<0.05). furthermore, non-smokers featured significant reductions in key phylotypes associated with periodontitis, whereas smokers presented more modest changes. conclusion: within the limits of the present study, st promoted comparable clinical improvements in smokers and non-smokers with severe chronic periodontitis. however, in smokers, st only slightly affected the subgingival biofilm biodiversity, as compared with non-smokers.

TI  == predominant bacterial species in subgingival plaque in dogs.
AB  == background and objective: the dog has been used extensively for experimental and  microbiological studies on periodontitis and peri-implantitis without detailed knowledge about the predominant flora of the subgingival plaque. this study was designed to evaluate the predominant cultivable bacterial species in dogs and compare them phenotypically and genotypically with corresponding human species. material and methods: four subgingival samples were taken from two upper premolars in each of six labrador retrievers. the samples from each dog were processed for anaerobic culture. from the samples of each dog, the five or six predominating bacteria based on colony morphology were selected and pure cultured. each of the strains was characterized by gram stain, anaerobic/aerobic  growth and api-zym test. eighteen strains showing clear-cut phenotypic differences were further classified based on dna sequencing technology. cross-reactions of dna probes from human and dog strains were also tested against a panel of both human and dog bacterial species. results: thirty-one strains in the dogs were isolated and characterized. they represented 21 different species,  of which six belonged to the genus porphyromonas. no species was found consistently in the predominant flora of all six dogs. porphyromonas crevioricanis and fusobacterium canifelinum were the two most prevalent species in predominant flora in dogs. dna probes from human and dog species cross-reacted to some extent with related strains from humans and dogs; however, distinct exceptions were found. conclusion: the predominant cultural subgingival flora in  dogs shows great similarities with the subgingival bacteria from humans at the genus level, but distinct differences at the species level; however, a genetic relatedness could be disclosed for most strains investigated.

TI  == the subgingival microbiota of papillon-lefevre syndrome.
AB  == background: there is little information about the microbiologic profiles of periodontal lesions in papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls) and the significance of bacteria in the pathogenesis of periodontitis in these patients. this comprehensive analysis of the subgingival microbiota in patients with pls used 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) clonal analysis and the 16s rrna-based human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: thirteen patients with pls from seven unrelated families volunteered for this microbiologic study. subgingival plaque was collected with sterile paper points from multiple sites with >/=5 mm probing depth, and whole genomic dna was extracted. the 16s rrna genes were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. the samples were then probed for approximately 300 predominant oral bacterial species using the homim. results: the most commonly detected phylotypes in the clonal analysis were gemella morbillorum, gemella haemolysans, granulicatella adiacens, lachnospiraceae ot 100 (ei074), parvimonas micra, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. as a group, streptococci were commonly detected in these individuals. in the homim analysis, a total of 170 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected, with a range of 40 to 80 species per patient with pls. of these, 12 bacterial species were detected in medium to high levels in >/=50% of the individuals. the high-frequency strains were clustered into eight groups: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter spp., capnocytophaga granulosa, g. morbillorum, p. micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, streptococcus spp., and tannerella forsythia. conclusions: the subgingival microbiota in pls is diverse.  periodontal pathogens commonly associated with chronic and aggressive periodontitis and opportunistic pathogens may be associated with the development  of severe periodontitis in patients with pls.

TI  == porphyromonas endodontalis lipopolysaccharides induce rankl by mouse osteoblast in a way different from that of escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide.
AB  == introduction: porphyromonas endodontalis lipopolysaccharide (lps) has been shown  to have a high positive rate in infected root canals and symptomatic apical periodontitis. it may play an integral role as a potent stimulator of inflammatory cytokines involved in apical lesions. the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappab ligand (rankl) has been proven to be the key regulator of bone remodeling. this study investigated p. endodontalis lps-induced rankl production and lps signaling in mouse osteoblasts. methods: lps-induced rankl production in mouse osteoblast mc3t3-e1 cells was measured by western blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the toll-like receptors (tlrs) were determined by the blocking test using anti-tlrs antibodies. in addition, specific inhibitors were used to analyze the intracellular signaling pathways. escherichia coli lps was used as the control. results: both of the anti-tlr2 and anti-tlr4 antibodies significantly (p < .05) inhibited the expression of rankl from osteoblasts stimulated with p. endodontalis lps; only anti-tlr2 antibody had a significant (p < .05) inhibitory effect on e. coli lps signaling. sp600125 (c-jun n-terminal kinase [jnk] inhibitor) prevented the up-regulation of rankl expression in p. endodontalis lps-infected osteoblasts (p < .05). the inhibitory  effect of wortmannin (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor) and pd98059 (mitogen-activated protein kinase [mapk]/extracellular signal-regulated kinase [erk] kinase-1/2 [mek 1/2] inhibitor) were observed in e. coli lps-treated mouse  osteoblasts (p < .05). conclusions: results from this study showed that p. endodontalis lps has the ability to promote the expression of rankl in mouse osteoblasts, and this induction was mainly through the tlr2/4-jnk signaling pathway, a situation quite different from that of typical bacterial endotoxin (e. coli lps).

TI  == asp- and glu-specific novel dipeptidyl peptidase 11 of porphyromonas gingivalis ensures utilization of proteinaceous energy sources.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis and porphyromonas endodontalis, asaccharolytic black-pigmented anaerobes, are predominant pathogens of human chronic and periapical periodontitis, respectively. they incorporate di- and tripeptides from the environment as carbon and energy sources. in the present study we cloned a novel dipeptidyl peptidase (dpp) gene of p. endodontalis atcc 35406, designated as dpp11. the dpp11 gene encoded 717 amino acids with a molecular mass of 81,090  da and was present as a 75-kda form with an n terminus of asp(22). a homology search revealed the presence of a p. gingivalis orthologue, pgn0607, that has been categorized as an isoform of authentic dpp7. p. gingivalis dpp11 was exclusively cell-associated as a truncated 60-kda form, and the gene ablation retarded cell growth. dpp11 specifically removed dipeptides from oligopeptides with the penultimate n-terminal asp and glu and has a p2-position preference to hydrophobic residues. optimum ph was 7.0, and the k(cat)/k(m) value was higher for asp than glu. those activities were lost by substitution of ser(652) in p. endodontalis and ser(655) in p. gingivalis dpp11 to ala, and they were consistently decreased with increasing nacl concentration. arg(670) is a unique amino acid completely conserved in all dpp11 members distributed in the genera porphyromonas, bacteroides, and parabacteroides, whereas this residue is converted to gly in all authentic dpp7 members. substitution analysis suggested that arg(670) interacts with an acidic residue of the substrate. considered to preferentially utilize acidic amino acids, dpp11 ensures efficient degradation of oligopeptide substrates in these gram-negative anaerobic rods.

TI  == electrochemically induced anatase inhibits bacterial colonization on titanium grade 2 and ti6al4v alloy for dental and orthopedic devices.
AB  == bacterial contamination of implanted devices is a common cause of their failure.  the aim of the present study was to assess the capability of electrochemical procedures to: (a) promote the formation of anatase on the surface of commercially pure grade 2 ti and ti grade 5 (ti6al4v) alloy; (b) inhibit in vitro biofilm formation of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis and oral plaque in vivo, (c) preserve favorable response of osteoblasts and fibroblasts to materials surfaces. ti grade 2 and ti grade 5 were respectively anodized at two different voltages: 90 and 130v for pure titanium; 100 and 120v for ti6al4v alloy. surface characterization was performed by scanning electron microscopy (sem) equipped with eds probe, laser profilometry and x-ray diffractometry. bacterial adhesion characterization was performed either in vitro and in vivo in patients. osteoblast and fibroblast response was evaluated by metabolic activity assessment. the higher voltage applied in the anodization treatment of pure titanium (130v) and ti6al4v alloy (120v) surfaces, compared to the untreated pure titanium and ti6al4v and to lower voltage treatments, resulted in a greater decrease in bacterial attachment and biofilm formation in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. in contrast, the high voltage treatments were found to promote  osteoblasts and fibroblasts proliferation. the observations indicated that the experimented high voltage anodization treatments may contribute to preserve the tissue integration and reduce bacteria colonization of titanium and titanium alloy for implantable applications.

TI  == characterization of the porphyromonas gingivalis conjugative transposon ctnpg1: determination of the integration site and the genes essential for conjugal transfer.
AB  == in our previous study, extensive genomic rearrangements were found in two strains of the gram-negative anaerobic bacterium porphyromonas (por.) gingivalis, and most of these rearrangements were associated with mobile genetic elements such as insertion sequences and conjugative transposons (ctns). ctnpg1, identified in por. gingivalis strain atcc 33277, was the first complete ctn reported for the genus porphyromonas. in the present study, we found that ctnpg1 can be transferred from strain atcc 33277 to another por. gingivalis strain, w83, at a frequency of 10(-7) to 10(-6). the excision of ctnpg1 from the chromosome in a donor cell depends on an integrase (int; pgn_0094) encoded in ctnpg1, whereas ctnpg1 excision is independent of pgn_0084 (a dna topoisomerase i homologue; exc) encoded within ctnpg1 and reca (pgn_1057) on the donor chromosome. intriguingly,  however, the transfer of ctnpg1 between por. gingivalis strains requires reca function in the recipient. sequencing analysis of ctnpg1-integrated sites on the  chromosomes of transconjugants revealed that the consensus attachment (att) sequence is a 13 bp sequence, ttttcnnnnaaaa. we further report that ctnpg1 is able to transfer to two other bacterial species, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and prevotella oralis. in addition, ctnpg1-like ctns are located in the genomes of other oral anaerobic bacteria, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella buccae and  prevotella intermedia, with the same consensus att sequence. these results suggest that ctns in the ctnpg1 family are widely distributed among oral anaerobic gram-negative bacteria found in humans and play important roles in horizontal gene transfer among these bacteria.

TI  == detection and clonal analysis of anaerobic bacteria associated to endodontic-periodontal lesions.
AB  == background: microbial agents in root canal systems can induce periodontal inflammation. the aims of this study are to detect anaerobic microorganisms in endodontic-periodontal lesions, determine the genetic diversity among them, and assess the simultaneous colonization of the pulp and periodontal microenvironments by a single clone. methods: twenty-seven teeth of patients with endodontic-periodontal lesions were selected. samples were spread on an agar-blood medium, the detection of each species was performed using a polymerase chain reaction, and the determination of the simultaneous presence of the same species in the microenvironments by one or more clones was determined using arbitrarily primed pcr. results: prevotella intermedia (pi) was the most prevalent species of the colonies in periodontal pockets, whereas porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) and pi were the more prevalent in root canals. isolates of pi and pg were simultaneously identified in root canals and periodontal pockets. eighteen percent of teeth exhibited the simultaneous colonization by pg, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and porphyromonas endodontalis in the pulp and periodontal microenvironments. the presence of these species was  noted even in niches from which no colonies were isolated. seventeen different genotypes were found in periodontal and pulp sites, with the majority of sites colonized by one or two different genotypes. a high degree of genotype similarity was found for samples of pg isolated from only one site as well as for those isolated from both microenvironments. conclusion: different clones of pi and pg with a high intraspecific genotype similarity were found to colonize the same anatomic sites in endodontic-periodontal infections.

AB  == objective: viral-bacterial and bacterial synergism have been suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of several human diseases. this study sought to investigate the possible associations between 9 candidate endodontic bacterial pathogens and 9 human viruses in samples from acute apical abscesses. study design: dna extracts from purulent exudate aspirates of 33 cases of acute apical  abscess were surveyed for the presence of 9 selected bacterial species using a 16s ribosomal rna gene-based nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr) approach. single or nested pcr assays were used for detection of the human papillomavirus (hpv) and herpesviruses types 1 to 8. results: two-thirds of the abscess samples  were positive for at least one of the target viruses. specifically, the most frequently detected viruses were hhv-8 (54.5%); hpv (9%); and varicella zoster virus (vzv), epstein-barr virus (ebv), and hhv-6 (6%). bacterial dna was present  in all cases and the most prevalent bacterial species were treponema denticola (70%), tannerella forsythia (67%), porphyromonas endodontalis (67%), dialister invisus (61%), and dialister pneumosintes (57.5%). hhv-8 was positively associated with 7 of the target bacterial species and hpv with 4, but all these associations were weak. several bacterial pairs showed a moderate positive association. viral coinfection was found in 6 abscess cases, but no significant viral association could be determined. conclusions: findings demonstrated that bacterial and viral dna occurred concomitantly in two-thirds of the samples from  endodontic abscesses. although this may suggest a role for viruses in the etiology of apical abscesses, the possibility also exists that the presence of viruses in abscess samples is merely a consequence of the bacterially induced disease process. further studies are necessary to clarify the role of these viral-bacterial interactions, if any, in the pathogenesis of acute apical abscesses.

TI  == apical root canal microbiota as determined by reverse-capture checkerboard analysis of cryogenically ground root samples from teeth with apical periodontitis.
AB  == introduction: bacteria located in the apical root canal system potentially participate in the pathogenesis of apical periodontitis. detection and identification of apical bacteria can be compromised because of limitations in conventional sampling and identification procedures. this study identified several bacterial taxa in the apical and middle/coronal segments of primarily infected root canal system by using pulverized root segments and a culture-independent molecular method. methods: seventeen extracted teeth with attached apical periodontitis lesions were sectioned to obtain 2 root fragments (apical and middle/coronal segments). root fragments were cryogenically ground, and dna was extracted from samples. after multiple displacement amplification, dna from samples was used as template in a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay targeting 28 bacterial taxa. results: bacterial dna was detected in all samples. the most prevalent taxa in the apical root canal system  were olsenella uli (76.5%), prevotella baroniae (71%), porphyromonas endodontalis (65%), fusobacterium nucleatum (53%), and tannerella forsythia (47%). o. uli, p.  endodontalis, and propionibacterium acnes were as frequently detected in apical samples as they were in middle/coronal samples. p. baroniae, t. forsythia, and f. nucleatum were found more frequently in the apical part of the canal as compared  with matched coronal segments. streptococcus species were more prevalent in middle/coronal samples. the median and mean of shared bacterial taxa between matched apical and middle/coronal segments were 27% and 41%, respectively. conclusions: several candidate endodontic pathogens were very prevalent in the apical root canal system. the apical microbiota was usually complex and differed  in species composition when compared with the microbiota of middle/coronal samples from the same tooth.

TI  == surgical endodontic treatment of refractory periapical periodontitis with extraradicular biofilm.
AB  == objective: this study explored the effect of surgical endodontic treatment of refractory periapical periodontitis with extraradicular biofilm. study design: endodontic surgery was conducted on a case of refractory periapical periodontitis with extraradicular biofilm. during the procedure, the samples of periapical tissues were collected for microbiologic analysis. the resected root ends were observed under scanning electron microscope. the patient was recalled every 3 months to evaluate the treatment effect for 1 year. results: the samples yielded  1 type of facultative anaerobic bacteria (streptococcus sanguis) and 2 types of obligate anaerobic bacteria (porphynomonas endodontalis and prevotella oralis). mature bacteria biofilms were formed on the surface of the root apexes. at the 1-year recall visit, the radiograph and the clinic examination showed the refractory periapical periodontitis was cured successfully. conclusions: the periapical bacterial biofilm may contribute to the refractory periapical periodontitis. endodontic surgery is a good option for definitive removal of an established extraradicular infection.

TI  == mapk signaling is required for lps-induced vegf in pulp stem cells.
AB  == caries-induced pulpitis is typically accompanied by an increase in dental pulp microvascular density. however, the mechanisms by which dental pulp cells recognize lipopolysaccharides (lpss) remain unclear. we hypothesized that porphyromonas endodontalis and escherichia coli lpss induce vascular endothelial  growth factor (vegf) expression in dental pulp stem cells (dpsc) and human dental pulp fibroblasts (hdpf) through mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) signaling. elisa, semi-quantitative rt-pcr, immunofluorescence, and western blots were used. here, we observed that lpss induced vegf expression in dpsc and hdpf cells, and both cell types express toll-like receptor 4 (tlr- 4). notably, lps-induced vegf is associated with phosphorylation of protein kinase c (pkc zeta) and extracellular signal-regulator kinase (erk1/2) and is dependent upon mapk activation. analysis of these data, collectively, unveils a signaling pathway responsible for synthesis of vegf by pulp cells and suggests a novel therapeutic target for the management of vascular responses in teeth with pulpitis.

TI  == sonic extracts from a bacterium related to periapical disease activate gelatinase a and inactivate tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases timp-1 and timp-2.
AB  == aim: to examine the effects of sonicated bacterial extracts (sbes) from three related to periapical disease bacteria (porphyromonas gingivalis, p. endodontalis and f. nucleatum) on the activation of matrix metalloproteinase (mmp-2) and the inactivation of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (timp-1 and timp-2). methodology: each sbe was added to cultures of human periodontal ligament (pl) cells or ht1080 cells and their supernatants were analysed by zymography for mmp-2. each sbe was added to pl cell cultures, and the amount of timp-1 was determined by elisa. p. gingivalis sbe was incubated with ht1080 cell culture supernatants, and the amounts of timp-1 and timp-2 were determined by elisa. statistical analysis was performed with the paired student's t-test. results: in  extracts of pl cells that had been incubated in the presence of p. gingivalis sbe, one representing pro-mmp-2 (72 kda) and a band corresponding to the active mmp-2 (66 kda) were observed; but in the other extracts it was not detected. when ht1080 cells were treated with p. gingivalis sbe, the pro-mmps was processed into 86- and 66-kda fragments, but in the other extracts, the processing did not occur when the other sbes were used. when pl cells were incubated with the same sbes, the amount of timp-1 was markedly decreased (p < 0.01), but in the other extracts, it was not. the amounts of both timp-1 and timp-2 were decreased in a dose-dependent manner when ht1080 cell culture supernatant was incubated with p.  gingivalis sbe. conclusions: these findings suggest that p. gingivalis sbe may cause connective tissue to be destroyed, contributing to the process of periapical disease, by activating pro-mmp-2 as well as by inactivating timp-1 and timp-2.

TI  == bacteria in the apical root canal of teeth with primary apical periodontitis.
AB  == objective: bacteria settled in the apical root canal are in a privileged position to inflict damage to the periradicular tissues. therefore, the species identified in this region can be of special relevance for the pathogenesis of apical periodontitis. this study investigated the occurrence and levels of several bacterial taxa in the apical root canal of teeth with apical periodontitis. study design: dna extracts from samples taken from the apical part of the root canal of extracted teeth evincing chronic apical periodontitis lesions served as templates for analysis of the presence and levels of 28 bacterial species/phylotypes using  a 16s ribosomal rna gene-based reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay.  results: bacterial dna was detected in 19 out of 20 samples. detected taxa included pseudoramibacter alactolyticus (32%), bacteroidetes clone x083 (26%), streptococcus species (21%), olsenella uli (10.5%), synergistes clone ba121 (10.5%), fusobacterium nucleatum (10.5%), porphyromonas endodontalis (10.5%), dialister clone bs016 (5%), filifactor alocis (5%), parvimonas micra (5%), and treponema denticola (5%). of these, only bacteroidetes clone x083 and synergistes clone ba121 were found at levels above 10(5). conclusion: occurrence of these bacterial taxa in the apical part of infected root canals indicates their potential pathogenetic role in the etiology of apical periodontitis.

TI  == the microbiota of acute apical abscesses.
AB  == as the breadth of bacterial diversity in the oral cavity has been deciphered by molecular studies, several newly identified species/phylotypes have emerged as potential pathogens. we hypothesized that many of these species/phylotypes could  also be involved with the etiology of endodontic abscesses. abscess aspirates from 42 persons were analyzed for the presence of 81 species/phylotypes by means  of a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. associations between the most frequently detected taxa were calculated. the most prevalent taxa were fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, and porphyromonas endodontalis. other  frequently found taxa included olsenella uli, streptococci, eikenella corrodens,  some as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes (bacteroidetes clone x083 and synergistes clone ba121), and newly named species (prevotella baroniae and dialister invisus). several positive bacterial associations were disclosed. findings not only strengthen the association of many cultivable species with abscesses, but also include some newly named species and uncultivated phylotypes in the set of candidate pathogens associated with this disease.

TI  == antibacterial activity of [10]-gingerol and [12]-gingerol isolated from ginger rhizome against periodontal bacteria.
AB  == ginger (zingiber officinale roscoe) has been used widely as a food spice and an herbal medicine. in particular, its gingerol-related components have been reported to possess antimicrobial and antifungal properties, as well as several pharmaceutical properties. however, the effective ginger constituents that inhibit the growth of oral bacteria associated with periodontitis in the human oral cavity have not been elucidated. this study revealed that the ethanol and n-hexane extracts of ginger exhibited antibacterial activities against three anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 53978, porphyromonas endodontalis atcc 35406 and prevotella intermedia atcc 25611, causing periodontal diseases. thereafter, five ginger constituents were isolated  by a preparative high-performance liquid chromatographic method from the active silica-gel column chromatography fractions, elucidated their structures by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and their antibacterial activity evaluated. in conclusion, two highly alkylated gingerols, [10]-gingerol and [12]-gingerol effectively inhibited the growth of these oral pathogens at a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) range of 6-30 microg/ml. these ginger compounds also killed the oral pathogens at a minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) range of 4-20 microg/ml, but not the other ginger compounds 5-acetoxy-[6]-gingerol, 3,5-diacetoxy-[6]-gingerdiol and galanolactone.

TI  == molecular identification and quantification of bacteria from endodontic infections using real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == introduction: it was the aim of the present study to evaluate root canal samples  for the presence and numbers of specific species as well as for total bacterial load in teeth with chronic apical periodontitis using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). methods: forty adult patients with one radiographically documented periapical lesion were included. twenty teeth presented with primary infections and 20 with secondary infections, requiring retreatment. after removal of necrotic pulp tissue or root canal filling, a first bacterial sample was obtained. following chemo-mechanical root canal preparation  a second sample was taken and a third sample was obtained after 14 days of intracanal dressing with calcium hydroxide. analysis by real-time pcr enabled the quantification of total bacterial counts and of nine selected species. results: root canals with primary infections harbored significantly more bacteria (by total bacterial count) than teeth with secondary infections (p < 0.05). mean total bacterial count in the retreatment group was 2.1 x 10(6) and was significantly reduced following root canal preparation (3.6 x 10(4)) and intracanal dressing (1.4 x 10(5)). corresponding values for primary infections were: 4.6 x 10(7), 3.6 x 10(4), and 6.9 x 10(4). the numbers of the selected bacteria and their detection frequency were also significantly reduced. conclusion: root canals with primary infections contained a higher bacterial load. chemo-mechanical root canal preparation reduced bacterial counts by at least 95%.

TI  == root canal microbiota of teeth with chronic apical periodontitis.
AB  == samples from infected root canals of 43 teeth with chronic apical periodontitis were analyzed for the presence and relative levels of 83 oral bacterial species and/or phylotypes using a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. associations between the most frequently detected taxa were also recorded. the most prevalent taxa were olsenella uli (74%), eikenella corrodens (63%), porphyromonas endodontalis (56%), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (54%), and bacteroidetes oral clone x083 (51%). when prevalence was considered only for bacteria present at levels >10(5), bacteroidetes clone x083 was the most frequently isolated bacterium (37%), followed by parvimonas micra (28%), e. corrodens (23%), and tannerella forsythia (19%). the number of target taxa per canal was directly proportional to the size of the apical periodontitis lesion, with lesions >10 mm in diameter harboring a mean number of approximately 20 taxa. several positive associations for the most prevalent taxa were disclosed for the  first time and may have important ecological and pathogenic implications. in addition to strengthening the association of several cultivable named species with chronic apical periodontitis, the present findings using a large-scale analysis allowed the inclusion of some newly named species and as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes in the set of candidate pathogens associated with  this disease.

TI  == tannerella forsythia and pseudomonas aeruginosa in subgingival bacterial samples  from parous women.
AB  == background: information on the subgingival microbiota in parous women is limited. the present study assessed 74 bacterial species at periodontal sites. methods: subgingival bacterial plaque was collected from women > or =6 months after delivery. bacteria were assessed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. gingivitis was defined as > or =20% of sites with bleeding on probing (bop), and periodontitis was defined as radiographic evidence of bone loss and probing depths > or =5.0 mm. results: a total of 197 women (mean age: 29.4 +/- 6.8 years; range: 18 to 46 years) were included in the study. gingivitis was identified in 82 of 138 subjects without evidence of periodontitis (59.4%). periodontitis was found in 59 women (32%). higher bacterial levels in subjects with gingivitis compared to those without evidence of gingivitis were observed for actinomyces neuii, bifidobacterium bifidum, corynebacterium pseudogenitalis,  porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella bivia, and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p <0.001 for each). higher bacterial levels in subjects with periodontitis compared to those without periodontitis (bop not accounted for) were found for 32 of 79 species (p <0.001) including lactobacillus iners, haemophilus influenzae, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), prevotella bivia, p. aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus. binary univariate logistic regression analysis identified that p. aeruginosa (p <0.001) and t. forsythia (p <0.05) were independently predictive of periodontal status. the odds ratio of having p. aeruginosa at levels > or =1 x 10(5) in the sample and periodontitis was 3.1 (95% confidence interval: 1.6 to 5.9; p <0.001). conclusion: in addition to p. gingivalis and t. forsythia, a diverse microbiota,  including p. aeruginosa, p. endodontalis, p. bivia, and s. aureus, can be found in subgingival plaque samples from women of child-bearing age with periodontitis.

TI  == improved accuracy in terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism phylogenetic analysis using a novel internal size standard definition.
AB  == background: terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis is commonly used to analyze microbial communities, including oral microflora. however, accurate identification of terminal restriction fragment (t-rf) origins  is prevented by unpredictable errors in sizing, thus necessitating the clone library analysis. to minimize sizing errors, we proposed optimizing the size definition of internal standards. methods: genescan-1000 rox was regenerated as an internal standard by redefining the fragment sizes in terms of molecular weight (mw) based on their mobility relative to 6-carboxyfluorescein (fam) -labeled restriction fragments derived from the 16s recombinant rna gene of porphyromonas gingivalis. using the new size definition, the average sizing error among eight oral bacteria from six phyla was estimated and compared with that of  the conventional method. microbial communities isolated from saliva were analyzed using the new mw size definition. bacterial species were assigned to peaks using  trfma, a web-based tool for t-rflp analysis, and compared with those identified in a clone library analysis. results: using the new size definition, the average  sizing error for 40 t-rfs was drastically reduced from 2.42 to 0.62 bases, and large sizing errors (more than two bases) were eliminated. more than 90% of the total bacterial clones detected by the clone library analysis were assigned by t-rflp. conclusion: the size definition of the newly constructed internal standards reduced fragment sizing errors and allowed for accurate assignment of bacteria to peaks by the t-rflp analysis. this provided a more effective means for studying microbial communities, including the oral microflora.

TI  == prevalence of selected bacterial named species and uncultivated phylotypes in endodontic abscesses from two geographic locations.
AB  == evidence is mounting that the prevalence of some putative endodontic pathogens can significantly vary according to the geographic location in which samples were taken. this study aimed to provide additional knowledge on this subject by comparing the frequencies of 10 selected candidate endodontic pathogens in samples of acute apical abscesses obtained from two distinct geographic locations; portland, or, and rio de janeiro, brazil. dna was extracted from aspirates and used as template in nested pcr assays using 16s rrna gene taxon-specific oligonucleotide primers. of the target species/phylotypes, treponema denticola (73% of the cases), porphyromonas endodontalis (70%), and tannerella forsythia (57%) were the most prevalent taxa found in brazilian samples. dialister invisus (70% of the cases), p. endodontalis (63%) and dialister pneumosintes (55%) were the most frequent taxa in the portland, or samples. data analysis revealed that t. denticola and t. forsythia were significantly more detected in brazilian samples than in the portland, or samples. although d. invisus, filifactor alocis, and synergistes oral clone w090  were detected in many more samples from the portland, or patients, differences were not found to be statistically significant. these findings confirmed that some bacterial taxa can markedly differ in the frequencies they occur in samples  from different locations. it remains to be clarified whether this observation translates into relevant therapeutic implications.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal species in symptomatic and asymptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal 16s rrna was used to examine polymicrobial communities within infected root canals of 20 symptomatic and 14 asymptomatic patients. nucleotide sequences from approximately 750 clones amplified from each patient group with universal bacterial primers were matched to the ribosomal database project ii database. phylotypes from 37 genera representing actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, firmicutes, fusobacteria and proteobacteria were identified. results were compared to those obtained with species-specific primers designed to detect prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas  gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus sp., streptococcus sp., fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythensis and treponema denticola. since members of the domain archaea have been implicated in  the severity of periodontal disease, and a recent report confirms that archaea are present in endodontic infections, 16s archaeal primers were also used to detect which patients carried these prokaryotes, to determine if their presence correlated with severity of the clinical symptoms. a methanobrevibacter oralis-like species was detected in one asymptomatic and one symptomatic patient. dna from root canals of these two patients was further analysed using species-specific primers to determine bacterial cohabitants. trep. denticola was  detected in the asymptomatic but not the symptomatic patient. conversely, porph.  endodontalis was found in the symptomatic but not the asymptomatic patient. all other species except enterococci were detected with the species-specific primers  in both patients. these results confirm the presence of archaea in root canals and provide additional insights into the polymicrobial communities in endodontic  infections associated with clinical symptoms.

AB  == the aims of this study were to investigate the effects of photodynamic therapy (pdt) on endodontic pathogens in planktonic phase as well as on enterococcus faecalis biofilms in experimentally infected root canals of extracted teeth. strains of microorganisms were sensitized with methylene blue (25 microg/ml) for  5 minutes followed by exposure to red light of 665 nm with an energy fluence of 30 j/cm2. methylene blue fully eliminated all bacterial species with the exception of e. faecalis (53% killing). the same concentration of methylene blue  in combination with red light (222 j/cm2) was able to eliminate 97% of e. faecalis biofilm bacteria in root canals using an optical fiber with multiple cylindrical diffusers that uniformly distributed light at 360 degrees. we conclude that pdt may be developed as an adjunctive procedure to kill residual bacteria in the root canal system after standard endodontic treatment.

TI  == multiplex polymerase chain reaction detection of black-pigmented bacteria in infections of endodontic origin.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to detect the presence of porphyromonas endodontalis, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, p. nigrescens, and p. tannerae from clinical samples using multiplex polymerase chain reactions (pcr).  two different multiplex pcr protocols were used (one for the two porphyromonas species and the other for the three prevotella species), each one using a primer  pair specific for each target species. the results were compared to those of the  conventional culture procedures. microbial samples were taken aseptically from 40 infected root canals and abscesses from patients. samples were cultured in an anaerobic condition for conventional identification using a rapid id 32 a kit. multiplex pcr was processed using the dna extracted from each sample. at least one of the five species of black-pigmented bacteria (bpb) were detected in 65% (26 of 40) of the samples using multiplex pcr, and in 15% (6 of 40) using the conventional culture procedures. multiplex pcr was more rapid, sensitive, specific, and effective in detecting bpb than the conventional culture procedures.

TI  == a new checkerboard panel for testing bacterial markers in periodontal disease.
AB  == background/aims: various microbiological methods have been used for testing bacterial markers for periodontitis and periodontal disease progression. most studies have used only a limited number of well recognized bacterial species. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the association of 13 more recently  identified bacterial species in a new panel in comparison with 12 previously more recognized periodontotopathogens ('old panel') using the 'checkerboard' dna-dna hybridization method. methods: fifty individuals were chosen who showed at least  one site with a probing pocket depth of 6 mm or more (disease) and bleeding on probing and at least one site with a probing pocket depth of 3 mm and without bleeding on probing (health). one diseased and one healthy site on each individual were sampled with the paperpoint technique and the samples were processed in the checkerboard technique against deoxigenin-labeled whole genomic  probes to 25 subgingival species representing 12 well recognized and 13 newly identified periodontitis associated species. results: twenty-four (out of 25) species were detected more frequently in the subgingival plaque of diseased than  healthy sites both at score 1 (> 10(4)) and score 3 (> 10(5)). a significant difference at the higher score (score 3) was noticed for all species of the old panel except for three (streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, and eikenella corrodens). of the species in the new panel only prevotella tannerae, filifactor alocis, and porphyromonas endodontalis showed a statistical significant difference between diseased and healthy sites. conclusion: it was concluded that p. tannerae, f. alocis, and p. endodontalis should be added to the 12 species used for routine diagnostics of periodontitis-associated bacterial flora.

TI  == examination of the signal transduction pathways leading to upregulation of tissue type plasminogen activator by porphyromonas endodontalis in human pulp cells.
AB  == aim: to investigate the tissue type plasminogen activator (t-pa) activity in human pulp cells stimulated with porphyromonas endodontalis (p. endodontalis) in  the absence or presence of p38 inhibitor sb203580, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (mek) inhibitor u0126 and phosphatidylinositaol 3-kinase (pi3k) inhibitor ly294002. methodology: the supernatants of p. endodontalis were used to evaluate t-pa activity in human pulp cells using casein zymography and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). furthermore, to search for possible signal transduction pathways, sb203580, u0126 and ly294002 were added to test how they modulated the t-pa activity. results: the main casein secreted by human pulp cells migrated at 70 kda and represented t-pa. secretion of t-pa was found to be  stimulated with p. endodontalis during 2-day cultured period (p < 0.05). from the results of casein zymography and elisa, sb203580 and u0126 significantly reduced  the p. endodontalis stimulated t-pa production respectively (p < 0.05). however,  ly294002 lacked the ability to change the p. endodontalis stimulated t-pa production (p > 0.05). conclusions: porphyromonas endodontalis enhances t-pa production in human pulp cells, and the signal transduction pathways p38 and mek  are involved in the inhibition of t-pa.

TI  == nf-kappab activation in human dental pulp stem cells by tnf and lps.
AB  == post-natal human dental pulp stem cells (dpscs) represent a unique precursor population in the dental pulp, which has multipotential and can regenerate a dentin/pulp-like structure. because the dental pulp is frequently infected by oral bacteria due to dental decay, in this study, we examined whether lipopolysaccharide (lps) and tumor necrosis factor (tnf) activated the immunologic transcription factor nuclear factor kappa b (nf-kappab) in dpscs. we  found that both tnf and lps activated the i-kappa b kinase complex (ikk) in dpscs to induce the phosphorylation and degradation of ikappabalpha, resulting in the nuclear translocation of nf-kappab. consistently, both tnf and lps rapidly induced the expression of the nf-kappab-dependent gene interleukin-8 (il-8). however, unlike in monocytes, we found that lps could not induce the phosphorylation of the nf-kappab active subunit p65 in dpscs. in summary, our studies suggest that dpscs may be involved in immune responses during pulpal infection through activating nf-kappab.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens in endodontic lesions detected by culture and by pcr.
AB  == he aim of this study was to investigate the presence of four black-pigmented bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens, in endodontic infections by culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analyses. microbial samples were obtained from 50 teeth with untreated necrotic pulps (primary infection) and from 50 teeth with failing endodontic treatment (secondary infection). microbiological strict anaerobic techniques were used for serial dilution, plating, incubation, and identification. for pcr detection, the samples were analyzed using species-specific primers of 16s rdna and the downstream intergenic spacer region. culture and pcr detected the test species in 13/100 and 50/100 of the study teeth, respectively. the organisms were cultured from 11/50 (22%) of primarily infected root canal samples and from 2/50 (4%) of secondary root canal samples. pcr detection identified the target species in 32/50 (64%) and 18/50 (36%) of primary and secondary infections, respectively. p. gingivalis was rarely isolated by culture methods (1%), but was the most frequently identified test species by pcr (38%). similarly, p. endodontalis was not recovered by culture from any tooth studied, but was detected by pcr in 25% of the sampled teeth. pcr-based identification also showed higher detection rates of p. intermedia (33%) and p. nigrescens (22%) than culture (13%). in conclusion, p. gingivalis, p. endodontalis, p. intermedia, and p. nigrescens were identified more frequently in teeth with necrotic pulp than in teeth with failing endodontic treatment. also, a higher frequency of black-pigmented species was detected by pcr than by culture.

TI  == differences in prevalence of selected bacterial species in primary endodontic infections from two distinct geographic locations.
AB  == objective: this study intended to compare the prevalence of 7 putative endodontic pathogens in samples of primary endodontic infections taken from patients of 2 distant geographic locations. study design: samples from infected root canals associated with asymptomatic periradicular lesions or from pus aspirated from acute periradicular abscesses were collected from patients in rio de janeiro, brazil, and seoul, south korea. south korean samples were frozen and delivered to brazil, where all steps in the molecular analysis were performed. dna was extracted and a species-specific nested polymerase chain reaction assay was used  to detect 7 target bacterial species. results: the most prevalent species detected in brazilian samples were porphyromonas endodontalis (79% of the cases)  , treponema denticola (79%), and dialister pneumosintes (76%). the most prevalent species found in south korean samples were fusobacterium nucleatum (38% of the cases) , tannerella forsythia (26%), and treponema maltophilum (24%). overall, p  endodontalis, d pneumosintes, filifactor alocis, t denticola, and t forsythia were significantly more detected in brazilian samples than in south korean samples ( p < .05). conclusions: findings indicated that the prevalence of some species in infections of endodontic origin may significantly differ from one geographic location to another.

TI  == 16s-23s rrna gene internal transcribed spacer sequences for analysis of the phylogenetic relationships among species of the genus porphyromonas.
AB  == the 16s-23s rrna gene internal transcribed spacer (its) regions of 11 reference strains of porphyromonas species, together with bacteroides distasonis and tannerella forsythensis, were analysed to examine interspecies relationships. compared with the phylogenetic tree generated using 16s rrna gene sequences, the  resolution of the its sequence-based tree was higher, but species positioning and clustering were similar with both approaches. the recent separation of porphyromonas gulae and porphyromonas gingivalis into distinct species was confirmed by the its data. in addition, analysis of the its sequences of 24 clinical isolates of porphyromonas asaccharolytica plus the type strain atcc 25260(t) divided the sequences into two clusters, of which one was alpha-fucosidase-positive (like the type strain) while the other was alpha-fucosidase-negative. the latter resembled the previously studied unusual extra-oral isolates of 'porphyromonas endodontalis-like organisms' (pelos) which  could therefore be called 'porphyromonas asaccharolytica-like organisms' (palos), based on the genetic identification. moreover, the proposal of alpha-fucosidase-negative p. asaccharolytica strains as a new species should also be considered.

TI  == detection of periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis by loop-mediated isothermal amplification method.
AB  == a method for nucleic acid amplification, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) was employed to develop a rapid and simple detection system for periodontal pathogen, porphyromonas gingivalis. a set of six primers was designed by targeting the 16s ribosomal rna gene. by the detection system, target dna was  amplified and visualized on agarose gel within 30 min under isothermal condition  at 64 degrees c with a detection limit of 20 cells of p. gingivalis. without gel  electrophoresis, the lamp amplicon was directly visualized in the reaction tube by addition of sybr green i for a naked-eye inspection. the lamp reaction was also assessed by white turbidity of magnesium pyrophosphate (a by-product of lamp) in the tube. detection limits of these naked-eye inspections were 20 cells  and 200 cells, respectively. although false-positive dna amplification was observed from more than 10(7) cells of porphyromonas endodontalis, no amplification was observed in other five related oral pathogens. further, quantitative detection of p. gingivalis was accomplished by a real-time monitoring of the lamp reaction using sybr green i with linearity over a range of 10(2)-10(6) cells. the real-time lamp was then applied to clinical samples of dental plaque and demonstrated almost identical results to the conventional real-time pcr with an advantage of rapidity. these findings indicate the potential usefulness of lamp for detecting and quantifying p. gingivalis, especially in its rapidity and simplicity.

TI  == porphyromonas uenonis sp. nov., a pathogen for humans distinct from p. asaccharolytica and p. endodontalis.
AB  == three porphyromonas species (porphyromonas asaccharolytica, p. endodontalis, and  the novel species that is the subject of the present report, p. uenonis) are very much alike in terms of biochemical characteristics, such as enzyme profiles and cellular fatty acid contents. p. asaccharolytica is distinguished from the other  two species by virtue of production of alpha-fucosidase and glyoxylic acid positivity. the novel species is difficult to differentiate from p. endodontalis  phenotypically and was designated a p. endodontalis-like organism for some time.  however, p. endodontalis is recovered almost exclusively from oral sources and also grows poorly on biolog universal agar, both characteristics that are in contrast to those of the other two organisms. furthermore, p. uenonis is glycerol positive in the biolog an microplate system. both p. asaccharolytica and p. uenonis are positive by 13 other tests in the biolog system, whereas p. endodontalis is negative by all of these tests. p. asaccharolytica grew well in both solid and liquid media without supplementation with 5% horse serum, whereas  the other two species grew poorly without supplementation. sequencing of 16s rrna revealed about 10% divergence between the novel species and p. endodontalis but less than 2% sequence difference between the novel species and p. asaccharolytica. subsequent dna-dna hybridization studies documented that the novel organism was indeed distinct from p. asaccharolytica. we propose the name porphyromonas uenonis for the novel species. we have recovered p. uenonis from four clinical infections in adults, all likely of intestinal origin, and from the feces of six children.

AB  == the antimicrobial efficacy of endodontic procedures performed in one-visit (including a 10-min intraappointment dressing with 5% iodine-potassium-iodide) was compared with a two-visit procedure (including an interappointment dressing with calcium-hydroxide paste). teeth with apical periodontitis (n = 96) were randomly assigned to either group. root canal sampling and culturing were performed before and immediately after instrumentation, and after medication. initial sampling demonstrated the presence of microorganisms in 98% of the teeth. postinstrumentation sampling showed reduction of cultivable microbiota. antibacterial dressing further reduced the number of teeth with surviving microbes. in the postmedication samples, residual microorganisms were recovered in 29% of the one-visit teeth and in 36% of the two-visit treated teeth. no statistically significant differences between the groups were discerned. it was concluded that from a microbiological point of view, treatment of teeth with apical periodontitis performed in two appointments was not more effective than the investigated one-visit procedure.

TI  == the role of lipopolysaccharide in infectious bone resorption of periapical lesion.
AB  == background: the role of lipopolysaccharide (lps) in periapical lesion-induced bone resorption was investigated. polymyxin b (pmb), a specific inhibitor of lps, was evaluated to treat the apical lesion. methods: lipopolysaccharide isolated from two common endodontic pathogens, fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas endodontalis, stimulated mouse macrophage (j774) to release interleukin-1alpha (il-1 alpha) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) in a time-dependent manner. results: combination of lps further enhanced the stimulation. pmb inhibited these effects significantly. lps also stimulated matrix metalloproteinase-1 (mmp-1) gene expression in j774, whereas anti-il-1 alpha and  anti-tnf-alpha antibodies, as well as pmb, diminished this effect. a disease model of periapical lesion was established in wistar rat. administration of pmb reduced the extent of lesion-associated bone resorption by 76% to approximately 80%, and simultaneously reduced the numbers of mmp-1-producing macrophages. conclusions: it is suggested that lps released from the infected root canal triggers the synthesis of il-1 alpha and tnf-alpha from macrophages. these pro-inflammatory cytokines up-regulate the production of mmp-1 by macrophages to  promote periapical bone resorption.

TI  == microbiological examination of infected dental root canals.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate the root canal microbiota of primary and secondary root-infected canals and the association of constituent species with specific endodontic signs and symptoms. methods: microbial samples were taken from 60 root canals, 41 with necrotic pulp tissues (primary infection) and 19 with failed endodontic treatment (secondary infection). strict anaerobic techniques were used for serial dilution, plating, incubation and identification. results: a total of 224 cultivable isolates were recovered belonging to 56 different bacterial species. individual root canals yielded a maximum of 10 bacterial species. of the bacterial isolates, 70% were either strict anaerobes or microphilic. the anaerobes most frequently isolated were: peptostreptococcus micros (35%), fusobacterium necrophorum (23.3%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.7%), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (16.7%), porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%) and porphyromonas endodontalis (5%). the root canal microflora of untreated teeth with apical periodontitis was found to be mixed, comprising gram-negative and gram-positive and mostly anaerobic microorganisms and usually containing more than 3 species per canal. on the other hand, facultative anaerobic and gram-positive bacteria predominated in canals with failed endodontic treatment, which harbored 1-2 species per canal. suggested relationships were found between  anaerobes, especially gram-negatives, and the presence or history of pain, tenderness to percussion and swelling (p<0.05). in particular, associations were  found between: a) pain (n=29) and p. micros (p<0.01), p. intermedia/nigrescens and eubacterium spp. (both p<0.05); b) history of pain (n=31) and p. micros (p<0.01) porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); c) tenderness to percussion (n=29) and porphyromonas spp. (p<0.01), peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.001); d) swelling (n=20) and peptostreptococcus spp. (p<0.01), porphyromonas and enterococcus spp. (p<0.05); e) wet canals (n=33) and  porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); f) purulent exudate (n=20) and porphyromonas, peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); previous endodontic treatment and enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus spp., p. micros, f. necrophorum (p<0.05). conclusions: our findings indicate potential complex interactions of species resulting in characteristic clinical pictures which cannot be achieved by individual species alone. they also indicate that the microbiota of primary infected canals with apical periodontitis differs in number and in species from the secondary infected canals by using the culture technique.

TI  == induction of cyclooxygenase-2 mrna and protein expression in human pulp cells stimulated with black-pigmented bacteroides.
AB  == cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2) is induced after the activation of cells by a variety of proinflammatory agents. recently, evidence has shown that cox-2 may play a role in the pathogenesis of pulpal inflammation. however, little is known regarding the mechanism of pulpal inflammation at the site of bacterial infection. the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of the supernatants from black-pigmented bacteroides (porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia) on the cox-2 expression in primary human pulp cells in vitro. investigations of the time dependence of cox-2 mrna expression in black-pigmented bacteroides-treated human pulp cells revealed a rapid accumulation of the transcript, a significant signal first detectable after 1 h of exposure. in addition, black-pigmented bacteroides also up-regulated cox-2 protein expression in human pulp cells. data from our in vitro experiment showed  that black-pigmented bacteroides were capable of stimulating cox-2 expression in  human pulp cells. these results indicate that black-pigmented bacteroides species may play an important role in the pathogenesis of pulpal inflammation. the activation of cox-2 may be one of the distinct host degradative pathways in the pathogenesis of microbial-induced pulpal/periapical inflammation.

TI  == production of macrophage inflammatory protein (mip)-1alpha and mip-1beta by human polymorphonuclear neutrophils stimulated with porphyromonas endodontalis lipopolysaccharide.
AB  == this study was undertaken to investigate the capacity of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmns) to secrete macrophage inflammatory protein (mip)-1alpha and mip-1beta after stimulation with porphyromonas endodontalis lipopolysaccharide (lps). escherichia coli lps was used as a positive control. venous blood was collected and pmns were isolated from healthy volunteers. cells were cultured with various concentrations of lps for different periods of time. cell supernatants were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the levels of chemokine secretion in pmns stimulated with each lps were found to be significantly higher than in the unstimulated control cells (p < 0.05), and this  expression occurred in a time- and dose-dependent manner. e. coli lps induced higher levels of cytokines than p. endodontalis lps. these findings demonstrated  that p. endodontalis lps is capable of stimulating pmns to produce chemotactic cytokines and suggested that pmns stimulated with p. endodontalis lps may play a  crucial role in the inflammatory and immunopathological reactions of pulpal and periapical diseases.

TI  == invasion of vascular cells in vitro by porphyromonas endodontalis.
AB  == aim: the objective of this study was to determine whether laboratory strains and  clinical isolates of microorganisms associated with root canal infections can invade primary cultures of cardiovascular cells. methodology: quantitative levels of bacterial invasion of human coronary artery endothelial cells (hcaec) and coronary artery smooth muscle cells (casmc) were measured using a standard antibiotic protection assay. transmission electron microscopy was used to confirm and visualize internalization within the vascular cells. results: of the laboratory and clinical strains tested, only p. endodontalis atcc 35406 was invasive in an antibiotic protection assay using hcaec and casmc. invasion of p.  endodontalis atcc 35406 was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. discussion: certain microorganisms associated with endodontic infections are invasive. if bacterial invasion of the vasculature contributes to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, then microorganisms in the pulp chamber represent potential pathogens.

TI  == stimulation of matrix metalloproteinases by black-pigmented bacteroides in human  pulp and periodontal ligament cell cultures.
AB  == matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) are a group of proteolytic enzymes capable of degrading most components of the extracellular matrix. recently, evidence has shown that mmps may play a role in tissue degradation in inflamed dental pulp. to date very little is known regarding the mechanism of extracellular matrix destruction at the site of bacterial infection. the purpose of this study was to  determine the effects of the supernatants from porphyromonas endodontalis and porphyromonas gingivalis on the production and secretion of mmps by primary human pulp and periodontal ligament (pdl) cell cultures in vitro. the results were evaluated by substrate gel zymography from long-term cultures. the main gelatinase secreted by human pulp and pdl cells migrated at 72 kda and represented mmp-2. minor gelatinolytic bands were also observed at 92 kda regions that correspond to mmp-9. after an 8-day culture period, p. endodontalis and p. gingivalis were found to elevate mmp-2 production both in human pulp and pdl cell cultures. in addition, the stimulation was in a dose- and time-dependent manner.  both human pulp and pdl cells, however, treated with either p. endodontalis or p. gingivalis had no effect on the pattern of mmp-9 produced or secreted in either cell extracts or conditioned medium fractions. these results indicate that black-pigmented bacteroides species play an important role in tissue destruction  and disintegration of extracellular matrix in pulpal and periapical diseases. thus, activation of mmps may be one of the distinct host degradative pathways in  the pathogenesis of microbial-induced pulpal and periapical lesion. an understanding of the actions of these black-pigmented bacteroides species on pulp and pdl cells may result in new therapies to augment current treatment of pulpal  and periapical lesions.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers against endodontic pathogens.
AB  == the antibacterial effects of various types of widely used endodontic sealers have not been compared systematically on facultative or obligate anaerobic endodontic  pathogens. the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of  four commonly used endodontic sealers: two epoxy-resin-based sealers (ah26, ah plus), one zinc-oxide eugenol-based sealer (n2), and one calcium hydroxide-based  sealer (sealapex). the testing microbes were four facultative anaerobic species (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus) and four obligate anaerobic species (porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia). the freshly mixed sealers were placed into the prepared wells of agar plates inoculated with the test microorganisms. after varying periods of incubation (2 days for facultative anaerobic species and 7 days for obligate anaerobic species), the zones of growth inhibition were observed and measured. all the sealers were distinctly different from each other in their antimicrobial  activity. the sealers showed different inhibitory effects depending on the types  and bacterial strains. n2 containing formaldehyde and eugenol proved to be the most effective against the microorganisms. the extreme antimicrobial potency of this root canal sealer must be weighted against its pronounced tissue toxic effect.

TI  == the purification and characterization of an 88-kda porphyromonas endodontalis 35406 protease.
AB  == a porphyromonas endodontalis atcc 35406 protease was purified from triton x-114 cell extracts by preparative sds-page followed by electroelution. the purified enzyme exhibits a molecular size of 88 kda and was dissociated into two polypeptides of 43 and 41 kda upon heating in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate with or without a reducing agent. the protease (ph optimum 7.5-8.0) degraded the extracellular matrix proteins fibrinogen and fibronectin. collagen iv was also degraded at 37 degrees c but not at 28 degrees c. the protease also cleaved the bioactive peptide angiotensin at amino acid residue phenylalanine-8 and tyrosine-4 but failed to hydrolyze bradykinin, vasopressin and synthetic chromogenic substrates with phenylalanine or tyrosine at the p1 position. in addition, two peptidases were detected in p. endodontalis cells: a proline aminopeptidase that remained associated with the cell pellet after detergent extraction and peptidase/s that partitioned into the triton x-114 phase after phase separation and degraded the bioactive peptides bradykinin and vasopressin.  these p. endodontalis peptidases and proteases may play an important role in both the nutrition and pathogenicity of these assacharolytic microorganisms. the inactivation of bioactive peptides and degradation of extracellular matrix proteins by bacterial enzymes may contribute to the damage of host tissues accompanied with endodontic infections.

TI  == a possible mechanism of maxillofacial abscess formation: involvement of porphyromonas endodontalis lipopolysaccharide via the expression of inflammatory  cytokines.
AB  == in a previous study, we developed a specific monoclonal antibody against porphyromonas endodontalis lipopolysaccharide, and demonstrated that this lipopolysaccharide was detected in bacterially infected root canal fluid. we suggest here that p. endodontalis lipopolysaccharide in the infectious materials  plays a stimulatory role in maxillofacial abscess formation via the expression of inflammatory cytokines. our epidemiological study showed that this lipopolysaccharide was detected in significant levels the infectious material of  patients with periapical periodontitis and odontogenic abscesses. interestingly,  infectious material-induced expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, or neutrophil chemoattractant kc genes in mouse macrophages, was significantly neutralized by monoclonal antibody against the lipopolysaccharide. in addition, we also detected a significant amount of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the infectious material. these results suggest that p. endodontalis lipopolysaccharide plays an important role in the pathogenic mechanism of maxillofacial abscess formation via the expression of inflammatory cytokines.

TI  == detection of putative oral pathogens in acute periradicular abscesses by 16s rdna-directed polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == a 16s rdna-directed polymerase chain reaction method was used to assess the occurrence of four black-pigmented anaerobic rods, treponema denticola, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in acute periradicular abscesses. pus was collected by aspiration from 10 cases diagnosed as acute abscesses of endodontic  origin. dna was extracted from the samples and analyzed using a polymerase chain  reaction-based identification assay. the method allowed detecting black-pigmented anaerobes in 80% of the examined abscesses. porphyromonas endodontalis was found  in 70%, t. denticola in 50%, porphyromonas gingivalis in 40%, and prevotella intermedia in 10% of the cases. p. gingivalis was always found associated with p. endodontalis. prevotella nigrescens and a. actinomycetemcomitans were not found in any pus sample. the high prevalence of p. endodontalis, t. denticola, and p. gingivalis suggests that they can play an important role in the etiology of acute periradicular abscesses.

TI  == detection of porphyromonas endodontalis in infected root canals by 16s rrna gene-directed polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == porphyromonas endodontalis has been isolated from the endodontic infections mainly in symptomatic teeth. this study evaluated the occurrence of p. endodontalis in both symptomatic and asymptomatic endodontic infections using 16s rrna gene-directed polymerase chain reaction. p. endodontalis was detected in 39.5% of the cases (17 of 43 teeth). it was present in 4 of the 6 cases with acute periradicular abscess (66.7%) and in 13 of the 37 other cases (35.1%). the  presence of p. endodontalis was associated with an asymptomatic periradicular lesion in 6 cases (25%) and in 10 teeth with tenderness to percussion (52.6%). p. endodontalis was also found in one asymptomatic case without evidence of periradicular pathosis. our results indicated that, although p. endodontalis is commonly detected in symptomatic cases, it can be present in asymptomatic root canal infections. further studies should determine if this bacterial species is really an important endodontopathogen.

TI  == porphyromonas endodontalis binds, reduces and grows on human hemoglobin.
AB  == porphyromonas endodontalis is a black-pigmented, obligate anaerobic rod-shaped bacterium implicated as playing a major role in endodontic infections. we have previously shown that p. endodontalis requires the porphyrin nucleus, preferably  supplied as hemoglobin, as a growth supplement. the bacteria also actively transport free iron, although this activity does not support growth in the absence of a porphyrin source. the purpose of this study was to further investigate the binding and subsequent utilization of human hemoglobin by p. endodontalis. p. endodontalis binds hemoglobin and reduces the fe(iii) porphyrin, resulting in a steady accumulation of ferrous hemoglobin. reduction of methemoglobin was similar to the extracellular reduction of nitrobluetetrazolium  in the presence of oxidizable substrate. turbidimetric and viable cell determinations showed that p. endodontalis grew when supplied only hemoglobin. therefore, we conclude that hemoglobin appears to serve as a sole carbon and nitrogen source, and that these bacteria reduce extracellular compounds at the expense of oxidized substrates.

TI  == assessment of periradicular microbiota by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == in the present study the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. in group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. the gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. bacterial dna was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. the mean number (+/- sd) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in group 2 (p < 0.001). the majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from group 1 than from group 2. the differences were most notable for campylobacter gracilis, porphyromonas endodontalis, propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, streptococcus constellatus and actinomyces naeslundii i. bacterial species such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. also, p. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. the data supported the idea that  following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. the study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. the detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.

TI  == anaerobic bacterial extracts influence production of matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors by human dental pulp cells.
AB  == the role of human dental pulp (hdp) cells in extracellular matrix degradation in  pulpitis is still unclear. in this study, the effects of sonicated bacterial extracts (sbes) from prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas endodontalis, and porphyromonas gingivalis on the balance between the production of matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) and that of their inhibitors [tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (timps)] by hdp cells were examined. hdp cells were treated with sbes, and their culture media were later harvested. mmp activities and timp concentrations were determined by use of independent measurement strategies and sensitive elisas. the production of mmp-1 and mmp-2 was accelerated by all sbe. on the other hand, timp-1 production was slightly elevated; and timp-2 production was markedly inhibited by all of the extracts. sbes derived from these anaerobic bacteria seemed to affect the acceleration of extracellular matrix degradation activity by hdp cells. these findings suggest that hdp cells stimulated by bacterial byproducts may be involved in the pathogenesis of pulpitis.

TI  == whole genomic dna probe for detection of porphyromonas endodontalis.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to develop a dna probe for porphyromonas endodontalis. pure cultures of p. endodontalis were grown in typ medium, in an anaerobic chamber. dna was extracted from the p. endodontalis and labeled using the genius system by boehringer mannheim. the labeled p. endodontalis dna was used in dot-blot hybridization reactions with homologous (p. endodontalis) and unrelated bacterial samples. to determine specificity, strains of 40 other oral bacterial species (e.g. porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica,  and prevotella intermedia) were spotted and reacted with the p. endodontalis dna  probe. none of the panel of 40 oral bacteria hybridized with the p. endodontalis  probe, whereas the blot of the homologous organism showed a strong positive reaction. to determine the sensitivity of the probe, dilutions of a p. endodontalis suspension of known concentration were blotted onto a nylon membrane and reacted with the probe. the results of our investigation indicate that the dna probe that we have prepared specifically detects only p. endodontalis and can detect at least 3 x 10(4) cells.

TI  == growth stimulation of porphyromonas endodontalis by hemoglobin and protoporphyrin ix.
AB  == porphyromonas endodontalis, like other porphyromonas species, has a complex set of nutritional requirements. in addition to being an obligate anaerobe, the bacterium must be grown in a complex medium consisting of amino acids, reducing agents and heme compounds. p. endodontalis accumulates high concentrations of heme pigments to the extent that colonies appear black on blood agar. this accumulation of heme and the need for these compounds has been characterized as iron requirements by these species. however, in our studies, p. endodontalis demonstrated growth dependence on hemoglobin or protoporphyrin ix but not on free iron. iron added to other heme compounds actually decreased growth stimulation by porphyrin-containing compounds. p. endodontalis actively transported free iron, but this process did not appear to be critical for growth. the maximum stimulation of growth by protoporphyrin ix, under conditions of iron deprivation, suggests that p. endodontalis requires the porphyrin moiety as a growth factor.

TI  == "checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  == background: we explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum igg responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. methods: one hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients  aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject;  2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic dna probes. serum igg antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. results: cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of eikenella corrodens, veillonella  parvula, and actinomyces naeslundii in controls. cases displayed higher igg levels against p. gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against f. nucleatum, t. denticola, e. nodatum,  and capnocytophaga ochracea. positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. in cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species  out of which only one was positive (v. parvula). both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. a logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. conclusion: a combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and arnica montana against oral pathogens.
AB  == arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. they possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. also, the antimicrobial activity of arnica has not been extensively investigated. therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by arnica and propolis extracts. arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from minas gerais state were compared with controls. fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: candida albicans--ntcc 3736, f72; staphylococcus aureus--atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis--atcc 29212;  streptococcus sobrinus 6715; strep. sanguis--atcc 10556; strep. cricetus--hs-6; strep. mutans--ingbritt 1600; strep. mutans--omz 175; actinomyces naeslundii--atcc 12104, w 1053; act. viscosus omz 105; porphyromonas gingivalis;  porph. endodontalis and prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. to assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30  degree angle. to assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 m sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. the propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for actinomyces spp. the arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. the arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for strep. mutans and 15% for strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same  concentrations. thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.

TI  == survey for collagenase gene prtc in porphyromonas gingivalis and porphyromonas endodontalis isolated from endodontic infections.
AB  == collagenase is a potential virulence factor shown to be expressed by porphyromonas gingivalis associated with periodontal disease. the purpose of this study was to use the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to detect the presence of the collagenase gene (prtc) in 21 strains of porphyromonas species isolated from  endodontic infections. type strains for p. gingivalis (atcc 33277), p. endodontalis (atcc 35406), prevotella intermedia (atcc 25611), and prevotella nigrescens (atcc 33563) were used as controls. when pcr primers specific for the  16s ribosomal rna gene of p. gingivalis or p. endodontalis were used, 16 of the strains were identified as p. gingivalis, and five strains were identified as p.  endodontalis. the presence of the prtc gene for collagenase was detected using pcr. amplicons were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, with an 815 bp amplicon representing the presence of the collagenase gene. type strain atcc 33277 and all 16 clinical isolates of p. gingivalis produced the collagenase gene amplicon. neither type strain atcc 35406 nor the five strains from clinical isolates of p. endodontalis produced the collagenase gene amplicon. these results indicate that p. gingivalis from endodontic infections possesses the prtc gene. p. endodontalis does not seem to exhibit prtc. the virulence of p. gingivalis may be related to its production of collagenase.

TI  == bacterium-dependent induction of cytokines in mononuclear cells and their pathologic consequences in vivo.
AB  == viridans streptococci are a heterogeneous group of gram-positive bacteria that are normal inhabitants of the mouth. these organisms are thought to contribute significantly to the etiology of infective endocarditis, although recently they have been implicated in serious infections in other settings. another group of oral bacteria, gram-negative anaerobes, is associated with chronic dental infections, such as periodontal diseases or endodontic lesion formation. we evaluated the ability of the oral pathogens streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas endodontalis to induce a pathogenic response in vivo, with the goal of quantifying the inflammatory response in soft tissue by measuring leukocyte recruitment and hard tissues by measuring osteoclastogenesis. s. mutans induced a strong inflammatory response and was a potent inducer of osteoclast formation, while p. endodontalis was not. to further study the mechanisms by which p. endodontalis and s. mutans elicit significantly different levels of inflammatory  responses in vivo, we tested the capacity of each to induce production of cytokines by mononuclear cells in vitro. s. mutans stimulated high levels of interleukin-12 (il-12), gamma interferon (ifn-gamma), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), all of which are associated with inflammation, enhanced monocyte function, and generation of a th1 response. in contrast, p. endodontalis stimulated production of il-10 but not of tnf-alpha, il-12, or ifn-gamma. these results demonstrate that oral pathogens differ dramatically in their abilities to induce inflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines. moreover, there is a high degree of correlation between the cytokine profile induced by these bacteria in vitro and their pathogenic capacity in vivo.

TI  == genetic relatedness between oral and intestinal isolates of porphyromonas endodontalis by analysis of random amplified polymorphic dna.
AB  == genomic fingerprints from the dna of 27 strains of porphyromonas endodontalis from diverse clinical and geographic origins were generated as random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) using the technique of pcr amplification with a single primer of arbitrary sequence. cluster analysis of the combined rapd data obtained with three selected 9- or 10-mer-long primers identified 25 distinct rapd types which clustered as three main groups identifying three genogroups. genogroups i and ii included exclusively p. endodontalis isolates of oral origin, while 7/9 human intestinal strains of genogroup iii which linked at a similarity level of 52% constituted the most homogeneous group in our study. genotypic diversity within p. endodontalis, as shown by rapd analysis, suggests that the taxon is composed of two oral genogroups and one intestinal genogroup. this hypothesis remains to be confirmed.

AB  == establishment of a microbial community in the root canal system depends on numerous factors, of which nutrient availability may be one of the most important. we hypothesized that the presence of red blood cells or hemoglobin in  this environment could cause shifts in microbial composition of communities, resulting in organisms such as porphyromonas endodontalis becoming more dominant. an in vitro model system using mixed, batch cultures was performed with the bacteria p. endodontalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros and  campylobacter rectus. bacteria were cultured in media with or without the addition of washed red blood cells, hemoglobin, or serum. cyclic growth studies revealed that p. endodontalis was lost from the community of organisms after three cycles. however, inclusion of red blood cells resulted in establishment of  this organism. moreover, red blood cells added to pure cultures of p. endodontalis substantially enhanced growth and protected the organisms from oxygen. we conclude that the presence of red blood cells could result in shifts of microbial communities of organisms within the root canal system.

TI  == isolation and characterization of a nonpigmented variant of porphyromonas endodontalis.
AB  == porphyromonas endodontalis forms dark colonies on media containing blood. we isolated, from an infected root canal, a non-black-pigmented p. endodontalis variant, ksew01, which forms beige colonies on blood agar media. to characterize  this variant, we compared its properties with those of two black-pigmented p. endodontalis strains, atcc35406 and kse105. strain ksew01 had a gelatinase activity comparable to that of the pigmented strains. cell lysates of these three strains resolved by sds-page electrophoresis showed similar protein patterns. quantitative dna-dna hybridization experiments indicated high homology between the nonpigmented strain ksew01 and the two dark-pigmented strains. from these results, we identified strain ksew01 as a p. endodontalis nonpigmented variant. dna restriction endonuclease analysis indicated that the variant was closely related to a pigmented strain, kse105. in contrast to the pigmented strains, strain ksew01 did not degrade hemoglobin and formed no vesicles when cultured in  the presence of blood. the susceptibilities of these three strains to 22 antibiotics were similar except for vancomycin. the nonpigmented variant was the  most resistant to vancomycin (mic: atcc35406, 6.25 micrograms/ml; kse105,12.5 micrograms/ml; ksew01, 100 micrograms/ml). overall, a relationship may exist between the presence of black-pigmentation and outer membrane systems of p. endodontalis.

TI  == stimulation of interleukin-1 beta production of human dental pulp cells by porphyromonas endodontalis lipopolysaccharide.
AB  == il-1 beta is synthesized as an inactive precursor, which is subsequently processed by il-1 beta converting enzyme (ice) and found extracellularly as a mature biologically active polypeptide. also, il-1 beta has been detected in necrotic and inflamed dental pulp. we examined the il-1 beta production in human  dental pulp (hdp) cells treated with lipopolysaccharide (lps) from porphyromonas  endodontalis (p. e.) isolated from root canals and radicular cyst fluids. we demonstrated that p. e. lps stimulated il-1 beta release from hdp cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. however, ice activity was not increased by p. e. lps. northern blot hybridization analysis revealed that the il-1 beta mrna level  in hdp cells was increased by p. e. lps. these results suggest that stimulation of il-1 beta release from hdp cells by p. e. lps may have an important role in the progression of inflammation in pulpal and periapical disease.

TI  == stimulation of interleukin-1beta-independent interleukin-6 production in human dental pulp cells by lipopolysaccharide.
AB  == dental pulpal infection is most commonly caused by extensive dental caries. a principal driving force behind pulpal disease response appears to lie in the immune system's response to bacteria. however, the production of interleukin (il)-1beta and il-6 in human dental pulp (hdp) cells in response to lipopolysaccharide (lps) has not been well characterized. we examined il-1beta and il-6 production in hdp cells by challenging with lps from porphyromonas endodontalis, which is a gram-negative bacteria found in root canals. our results presented here showed that when hdp cells were stimulated by lps, the production  of il-6 always preceded that of il-1beta. since the il-6 production was observed  even in the presence of the il-1beta receptor antagonist, we concluded il-6 production was independent of the il-1beta molecule in lps-stimulated hdp cells.  this idea was further supported by the results obtained from rt-pcr experiments,  in which il-6 mrna, but not il-1beta mrna, was present in the rna preparation isolated from the early stage of cells.

TI  == update on the taxonomy and the clinical and laboratory characteristics of pigmented anaerobic gram-negative rods.
AB  == pigmented anaerobic gram-negative rods are currently categorized as 17 species distributed in three genera: prevotella, porphyromonas, and bacteroides. these organisms are often encountered in clinical specimens but are also found as part  of the indigenous flora on various mucosal surfaces. several studies are presently assessing the association of individual species with health and disease. for example, porphyromonas gingivalis and porphyromonas endodontalis are key putative pathogens in adult periodontitis and root canal infections, respectively. porphyromonas asaccharolytica is prevalent in extraoral infections. the porphyromonas species of animal origin have been isolated from infected bite  wounds in humans. isolates closely resembling bacteroides levii have been recovered from various types of human infections. according to preliminary reports, prevotella intermedia tends to be associated more often with periodontal disease than with a healthy oral cavity. in the laboratory, enzyme profiling facilitates the identification of these pigmented rods. beta-lactamase production is more common among prevotella species (30%-50%) than among porphyromonas species (< 10%).

TI  == effects of lipopolysaccharides on human dental pulp cells.
AB  == human dental pulp cells were treated with 1, 10, and 100 micrograms/ml of lipopolysaccharide (lps). the effects of treatment were examined by measurement of the dna content, protein content, and alkaline phosphatase activity of the cells. lps samples were purified from porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum isolated from root canals, and escherichia coli 0111:b4 lps was used as a positive control. at a concentration of 1 microgram/ml, none of the lpss caused any change in the production of dna or protein, whereas the amount of dna was increased at 10 micrograms/ml and inhibited at 100 micrograms/ml. protein synthesis was decreased by lpss at both 10 and 100 micrograms/ml. alkaline phosphatase activity was not changed at any concentration of lps tested.

TI  == oligonucleotide probes to the 16s ribosomal rna: implications of sequence homology and secondary structure with particular reference to the oral species prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == eight oligonucleotides based upon regions of the small subunit 16s ribosomal rna  gene sequences were analysed against a background of their position within the molecule and their two-dimensional structure to rationalise their use in recognising prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens. the 41 clinical isolates from both oral and respiratory sites and two reference strains were subjected to dna-dna hybridisation and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis to confirm their identity. alignment of oligonucleotide probes designated i bi-2 to  i bi-6 (for p. intermedia) and 2bi-2 (for p. nigrescens) with the 16s rrna suggested that these probes lacked specificity or were constructed from hypervariable regions. a 52-mer oligonucleotide (designated bi) reliably detected both species. because of the high degree of concordance between the 16s rrnas of  both species, it was necessary to vary the stringency of hybridisation conditions for detection of both species. thus probe i bi-i recognised p. intermedia while i bi-i detected both p. intermedia and p. nigrescens at low stringency. however, under conditions of high stringency only p. nigrescens was recognised by probe 2bi-i. these probes were highly specific and did not hybridise with dna from the  closely related p. corporis, nor other periodontal pathogens such as fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola and several pigmented species such as prevotella melaninogenica, p. denticola, p. loescheii, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, py. endodontalis, py. gingivalis, py. levii, and py. macacae.

TI  == degradation of immunoglobulin g by periodontal bacteria.
AB  == several subgingival microorganisms were tested for their ability to utilize human immunoglobulin g (igg) as a substrate for growth. this was done using a protein-free chemically defined medium, supplemented with igg. stimulation of growth was observed for capnocytophaga ochracea, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella oralis, lactobacillus catenaforme and streptococcus intermedius. immunoelectrophoresis, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and a protein assay demonstrated that p. intermedia and p. endodontalis completely degraded the protein chains of igg. partial breakdown of igg was observed for p. asaccharolytica and c. ochracea, whereas p. oralis cleaved the igg heavy chain, yielding fc and fab fragments. all these bacteria utilized igg as a substrate for growth. binding studies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, revealed complete loss of in vitro antigen-antibody binding capacity after incubation of specific igg with p. endodontalis and partial loss of binding with  p. intermedia, p. gingivalis, c. ochracea or fusobacterium nucleatum. degradation or inactivation of igg by oral bacteria is thought to be important in the causation of polymicrobial infections.

TI  == stimulation of interleukin-6 production of periodontal ligament cells by porphyromonas endodontalis lipopolysaccharide.
AB  == interleukin-6 (il-6), which is a multifunctional cytokine, has important roles in acute and chronic inflammation and may also be implicated in bone resorption. we  examined the il-6 production in periodontal ligament (pdl) cells which were treated with lipopolysaccharide (lps) from several oral inflammatory pathogens. the lps from porphyromonas endodontalis, which was isolated from infected root canals and radicular cyst fluids, was more potent than the lps from any other periodontal organisms examined. p. endodontalis lps stimulated il-6 release from  pdl cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. northern blot hybridization analysis revealed that the il-6 mrna level in pdl cells was increased by p. endodontalis lps. these results suggest that stimulation of the il-6 release of pdl cells by p. endodontalis lps may have a role in the progression of inflammation and alveolar bone resorption in periodontal and periapical diseases.

AB  == a new species, porphyromonas canoris, is proposed for black-pigmented asaccharolytic strains isolated from subgingival plaque samples from dogs with naturally occurring periodontal disease. this bacterium is an obligately anaerobic, nonmotile, non-spore-forming, gram-negative, rod-shaped organism. on laked rabbit blood or sheep blood agar plates, colonies are light brown to greenish brown after 2 to 4 days of incubation and dark brown after 14 days of incubation. colonies on egg yolk agar and on nonhemolyzed sheep blood agar are orange. the cells do not grow in the presence of 20% bile and have a guanine-plus-cytosine content of 49 to 51 mol%. the type strain is vpb 4878 (= nctc 12835). the average levels of dna-dna hybridization between p. canoris strains and other members of the genus porphyromonas are as follows: porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277t (t = type strain), 6.5%; porphyromonas gingivalis cat strain vpb 3492, 5%; porphyromonas endodontalis atcc 35406t, 1%; porphyromonas salivosa nctc 11362t, 5%; and porphyromonas circumdentaria nctc 12469t, 6%. the level of hybridization between p. canoris nctc 12835t dna and porphyromonas asaccharolytica atcc 25260t dna is 3%. p. canoris cells produce major amounts of acetic, propionic, isovaleric, and succinic acids and minor amounts of isobutyric and butyric acids as end products of metabolism in cooked meat medium. the major cellular fatty acid is 13-methyltetradecanoic acid (iso-c15:0). glutamate and malate dehydrogenases are present, as are glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity (65.7 nmol mg of protein-1 min-1) and  6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activity (63.0 nmol mg of protein-1 min-1).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == hydrolytic enzymes and lectin-binding activity of black-pigmented anaerobic rods.
AB  == recent taxonomic studies on black-pigmented anaerobic rods, a group of bacteria found on mucosal surfaces of humans and animals, led to the subdivision of existing species and to the creation of new species. the aim of this study was to characterize all 11 currently recognized species of black-pigmented bacteria (55  strains) for their ability to hydrolyse a variety of natural and synthetic substrates and for their lectin reactivity. although most of the strains demonstrated some activity against proteinaceous substrates, porphyromonas gingivalis was the only species able to hydrolyse type i collagen. most strains possessed glycylprolyl protease activity, elastase-like activity and phospholipase c activity, whereas trypsin-like activity was restricted to p. gingivalis, porphyromonas salivosa and bacteroides macacae. beta-lactamase activity was demonstrated in five strains belonging to the saccharolytic group. the lectin reactivity of the bacteria was determined by a dot-blot procedure using horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated lectins. three lectins, lotus a, rca-i and cona, failed to react with any of the bacteria tested. wga reacted strongly with the cell surface of human biotypes of asaccharolytic black-pigmented bacteria (p. gingivalis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica and porphyromonas endodontalis) and prevotella intermedia. the animal biotype strains of p. gingivalis showed a higher affinity for sba and pna than for wga.

TI  == phylogeny of bacteroides, prevotella, and porphyromonas spp. and related bacteria.
AB  == the phylogenetic structure of the bacteroides subgroup of the cytophaga-flavobacter-bacteroides (cfb) phylum was examined by 16s rrna sequence  comparative analysis. approximately 95% of the 16s rrna sequence was determined for 36 representative strains of species of prevotella, bacteroides, and porphyromonas and related species by a modified sanger sequencing method. a phylogenetic tree was constructed from a corrected distance matrix by the neighbor-joining method, and the reliability of tree branching was established by bootstrap analysis. the bacteroides subgroup was divided primarily into three major phylogenetic clusters which contained most of the species examined. the first cluster, termed the prevotella cluster, was composed of 16 species of prevotella, including p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, and the ruminal species p. ruminicola. two oral species, p. zoogleoformans and p. heparinolytica, which had been recently placed in the genus prevotella, did not fall within the prevotella cluster. these two species and six species of bacteroides, including the type species b. fragilis, formed the second cluster, termed the bacteroides cluster. the third cluster, termed the porphyromonas cluster, was divided into two subclusters. the first contained porphyromonas gingivalis, p. endodontalis, p. asaccharolytica, p. circumdentaria, p. salivosa,  [bacteroides] levii (the brackets around genus are used to indicate that the species does not belong to the genus by the sensu stricto definition), and [bacteroides] macacae, and the second subcluster contained [bacteroides] forsythus and [bacteroides] distasonis. [bacteroides] splanchnicus fell just outside the three major clusters but still belonged within the bacteroides subgroup. with few exceptions, the 16 s rrna data were in overall agreement with  previously proposed reclassifications of species of bacteroides, prevotella, and  porphyromonas. suggestions are made to accommodate those species which do not fit previous reclassification schemes.

TI  == porphyromonas endodontalis: prevalence and distribution of restriction enzyme patterns in families.
AB  == in this study we determined the prevalence and distribution of porphyromonas endodontalis in 26 families consisting of 107 subjects. p. endodontalis was present in 24% of the investigated subjects and was recovered most often from the dorsum of the tongue (50%). isolation was also possible from the tonsils, the buccal mucosa, the saliva and the periodontal pocket. the usefulness of restriction endonuclease analysis as a typing method for this particular species  was investigated by typing 19 isolates from unrelated individuals. all these isolates had unique restriction endonuclease patterns. the observed heterogeneity indicates that restriction endonuclease analysis is a sensitive measure of genetic dissimilarity between p. endodontalis isolates and is able to characterize individual isolates. application of restriction endonuclease analysis to the obtained clinical isolates in this study shows the possibility of the presence of multiple clonal types within one subject. the dna patterns of all p. endodontalis isolates from unrelated individuals were found to be distinct. in 3 families the dna patterns of isolates from the mother and her child were indistinguishable. these data indicate the possibility of intrafamilial transmission of p. endodontalis.

TI  == black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes in endodontic infections.
AB  == necrotic dental root canal infections are polymicrobial infections dominated by anaerobic bacteria. the number of different species in one canal is usually low,  approx. 4-7 species. the species isolated most frequently belong to the genera prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium and streptococcus. the frequency of isolation of black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes in endodontic infections varies from 25% to > 50%. pr. intermedia is the most commonly found pigmented species, followed by pr. denticola and two porphyromonas species, p. gingivalis and p. endodontalis. several studies have shown that p. gingivalis and p. endodontalis are closely related to the presence  of acute symptoms in endodontic infections, whereas other black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes are not. however, several other species may also be involved in acute infections. moreover, porphyromonas species have occasionally been isolated from cases with no symptoms. although porphyromonas spp. are clearly related to symptoms at the beginning of therapy, they are not important for the prognosis of the treatment.

AB  == the aim of the present study was to develop a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the shared antigen of porphyromonas endodontalis so that we could use the antibody in direct identification and detection of p. endodontalis in infectious  material from apical periodontal patients. we established a hybridoma cell line producing monoclonal antibody (beb5) specific for p. endodontalis. beb5 antibody  reacted with all of the p. endodontalis strains tested, but not with any of the other black-pigmented porphyromonas and bacteroides spp. the antibody reacted specifically with the lipopolysaccharide (lps) of three p. endodontalis strains of different serotypes (o1k1, o1k2, and o1k-). western blotting (immunoblotting)  analysis confirmed the specificity of the antibody to these lpss, because the antibody recognized the typical "repetitive ladder" pattern characteristic of lps on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoretic gels. these observations demonstrate that p. endodontalis lps is the shared antigen of this species. the antibody can specifically identify p. endodontalis on nitrocellulose membrane blots of bacterial colonies grown on agar. the antibody is also capable of directly detecting the presence of p. endodontalis in infectious material by immunoslot blot assay. these results indicate that lps is the shared antigen of p. endodontalis and that beb5 antibody against lps is a useful one for direct identification and detection of the organisms in samples from apical periodontal  patients.

AB  == recent studies have demonstrated the presence of three serotypes (o1k1, o1k2, and o1k-) of porphyromonas (bacteroides) endodontalis. in the present study, a hybridoma cell line producing monoclonal antibody (bee11) specific for serotype o1k1 of p. endodontalis was established. the specificity of the antibody was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoslot blot analysis. bee11 antibody reacted with strains atcc 35406, hg 400, and hg 421 of the bacterium. however, it did not react with hg 422 or hg 948. also, the antibody did not react with any of the black-pigmented bacteroides strains tested. although the antibody reacted with total cell envelope and capsule materials, it  did not do so with lipopolysaccharide. the antibody reacted with antigen material having a molecular mass of 110 kilodaltons (kda), as judged from fractionation by superose 12 prep gel chromatography. when the peak fraction from the superose 12  column was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blot (immunoblot) analysis, the reactivity was detected as a single band at an apparent molecular mass of about 52 kda. the antigen material purified partially by high-performance liquid chromatography was sensitive to trypsin, v8  protease, and heating to 80 degrees c but not to neuraminidase. therefore, the present study shows that bee11 antibody recognizes a serotype antigen of p. endodontalis which may be a dimer consisting of monomers having molecular masses  of approximately 52 kda and sensitivity to proteases and heat.

TI  == the formation of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan by oral bacteria.
AB  == the capacity to form volatile sulfur compounds was tested in bacteria isolated from subgingival microbiotas and in a representative number of reference strains. a majority of the 75 tested oral bacterial species and 7 unnamed bacterial taxa formed significant amounts of hydrogen sulfide from l-cysteine. the most active bacteria were found in the genera peptostreptococcus, eubacterium, selenomonas, centipeda, bacteroides and fusobacterium. methyl mercaptan from l-methionine was  formed by some members of the genera fusobacterium, bacteroides, porphyromonas and eubacterium. when incubated in serum for 7 d, the most potent producers of hydrogen sulfide were treponema denticola and the black-pigmented species, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides loescheii, porphyromonas endodontalis and porphyromonas gingivalis. p. endodontalis and p. gingivalis also produced significant amounts of methyl mercaptan in serum. no other volatile sulfur compound was detected in serum or in the presence of l-cysteine and l-methionine. these findings significantly increase the list of oral bacteria known to produce  volatile sulfur compounds.

TI  == taxonomy, virulence and epidemiology of black-pigmented bacteroides species in relation to oral infections.
AB  == black-pigmented bacteroides species are recognized as suspected pathogens of oral infections. developments in the taxonomy of this group include description of a new asaccharolytic species, bacteroides salivosus, and proposal for the reclassification of the asaccharolytic species into a separate genus, porphyromonas. studies on the pathogenicity and virulence of black-pigmented bacteroides species have identified bacteroides gingivalis as the most virulent species. b. gingivalis and bacteroides intermedius have been associated with periodontal diseases; bacteroides endodontalis is isolated specifically from infections in the oral cavity, and other black-pigmented bacteroides species are  recovered from oral mucous sites. dna restriction endonuclease analysis was adapted for typing of b. gingivalis and b. intermedius.

TI  == cross-inhibition between black-pigmented bacteroides species.
AB  == cross-inhibition within the group of black-pigmented bacteroides, including both  oral and non-oral strains, was studied by means of a membrane filter technique. it was found that b. gingivalis possessed the most extended inhibitory capacity among all species tested. b. gingivalis showed inhibitory activity against b. intermedius, b. endodontalis, b. loescheii, and b. melaninogenicus. b. endodontalis was active against some b. intermedius strains. among the saccharolytic species, some b. melaninogenicus strains were inhibitory for some b. endodontalis strains, some b. gingivalis strains, and some b. intermedius strains. these inhibitory activities observed in vitro may play a role in the colonization of the periodontal pocket.
