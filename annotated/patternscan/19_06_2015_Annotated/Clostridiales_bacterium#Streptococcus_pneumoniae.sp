TI  == [antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2008].
AB  == the activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic gram-positive cocci (25 genus or species, 1029 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (21 genus or species, 187  strains) isolated from clinical specimens in 2008 at 16 clinical facilities in japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. the  ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis was 59.6% and 81.2%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated at high frequency. vancomycin (vcm), linezolid (lzd) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (qpr/dpr) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, with mic90s of < or = 2 microg/ml. the ratio of penicillin (pc) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of pc-binding proteins among streptococcus pneumoniae was 92.0% that was highest among our previous reports. cefpirome, carbapenems, vcm, teicoplanin (teic), lzd and qpr/dpr had mic90s of <  or = 1 microg/ml against pc-intermediate and resistant s. pneumoniae strains. against all strains of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, the mics of vcm and teic were under 2 microg/ml, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 15.9% of e. faecalis strains and 1.2% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate to lzd. 17.1% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to qpr/dpr.  against all strains of clostridium difficile, the mic of vcm was under 1 microg/ml, suggesting that vcm had excellent activity. carbapenems showed good activity against clostridiales, bacteroides spp., and prevotella spp., but one strain of bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems. and so, the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the future at detecting  continuously.
