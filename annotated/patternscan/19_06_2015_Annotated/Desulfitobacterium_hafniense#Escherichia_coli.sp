TI  == the transcriptional regulator cprk detects chlorination by combining direct and indirect readout mechanisms.
AB  == the transcriptional regulator cprk controls the expression of the reductive dehalogenase cpra in organohalide-respiring bacteria. desulfitobacterium hafniense cpra catalyses the reductive dechlorination of the terminal electron acceptor o-chlorophenol acetic acid, generating the phenol acetic acid product. it has been shown that cprk has ability to distinguish between the chlorinated cpra substrate and the de-halogenated end product, with an estimated an estimated 10(4)-fold difference in affinity. using a green fluorescent protein gfpuv-based  transcriptional reporter system, we establish that cprk can sense o-chlorophenol  acetic acid at the nanomolar level, whereas phenol acetic acid leads to transcriptional activation only when approaching micromolar levels. a structure-activity relationship study, using a range of o-chlorophenol acetic-acid-related compounds and key cprk mutants, combined with pka calculations on the effector binding site, suggests that the sensitive detection  of chlorination is achieved through a combination of direct and indirect readout  mechanisms. both the physical presence of the bulky chloride substituent as well  as the accompanying electronic effects lowering the inherent phenol pka are required for high affinity. indeed, transcriptional activation by cprk appears strictly dependent on establishing a phenolate-k133 salt bridge interaction, rather than on the presence of a halogen atom per se. as k133 is strictly conserved within the cprk family, our data suggest that physiological function and future applications in biosensing are probably restricted to phenolic compounds.

TI  == pylsn and the homologous n-terminal domain of pyrrolysyl-trna synthetase bind the trna that is essential for the genetic encoding of pyrrolysine.
AB  == pyrrolysine is represented by an amber codon in genes encoding proteins such as the methylamine methyltransferases present in some archaea and bacteria. pyrrolysyl-trna synthetase (pylrs) attaches pyrrolysine to the amber-suppressing  trna(pyl). archaeal pylrs, encoded by pyls, has a catalytic c-terminal domain but an n-terminal region of unknown function and structure. in bacteria, homologs of  the n- and c-terminal regions of archaeal pylrs are respectively encoded by pylsn and pylsc. we show here that wild type pyls from methanosarcina barkeri and pylsn from desulfitobacterium hafniense bind trna(pyl) in emsa with apparent k(d) values of 0.12 and 0.13 mum, respectively. truncation of the n-terminal region of pyls eliminated detectable trna(pyl) binding as measured by emsa, but not catalytic activity. a chimeric protein with pylsn fused to the n terminus of truncated pyls regained emsa-detectable trna(pyl) binding. pylsn did not bind other d. hafniense trnas, nor did the competition by the escherichia coli trna pool interfere with trna(pyl) binding. further indicating the specificity of pylsn interaction with trna(pyl), substitutions of conserved residues in trna(pyl) in the variable loop, d stem, and t stem and loop had significant impact in binding, whereas those having base changes in the acceptor stem or anticodon stem and loop still retained the ability to complex with pylsn. pylsn and the n terminus of pyls comprise the protein superfamily tigr03129. the members of this family are not similar to any known rna-binding protein, but our  results suggest their common function involves specific binding of trna(pyl).

TI  == characterization of an o-demethylase of desulfitobacterium hafniense dcb-2.
AB  == besides acetogenic bacteria, only desulfitobacterium has been described to utilize and cleave phenyl methyl ethers under anoxic conditions; however, no ether-cleaving o-demethylases from the latter organisms have been identified and  investigated so far. in this study, genes of an operon encoding o-demethylase components of desulfitobacterium hafniense strain dcb-2 were cloned and heterologously expressed in escherichia coli. methyltransferases i and ii were characterized. methyltransferase i mediated the ether cleavage and the transfer of the methyl group to the superreduced corrinoid of a corrinoid protein. desulfitobacterium methyltransferase i had 66% identity (80% similarity) to that  of the vanillate-demethylating methyltransferase i (odmb) of acetobacterium dehalogenans. the substrate spectrum was also similar to that of the latter enzyme; however, desulfitobacterium methyltransferase i showed a higher level of  activity for guaiacol and used methyl chloride as a substrate. methyltransferase  ii catalyzed the transfer of the methyl group from the methylated corrinoid protein to tetrahydrofolate. it also showed a high identity ( approximately 70%)  to methyltransferases ii of a. dehalogenans. the corrinoid protein was produced in e. coli as cofactor-free apoprotein that could be reconstituted with hydroxocobalamin or methylcobalamin to function in the methyltransferase i and ii assays. six cog3894 proteins, which were assumed to function as activating enzymes mediating the reduction of the corrinoid protein after an inadvertent oxidation of the corrinoid cofactor, were studied with respect to their abilities to reduce the recombinant reconstituted corrinoid protein. of these six proteins, only one was found to catalyze the reduction of the corrinoid protein.

TI  == the complex structures of isocitrate dehydrogenase from clostridium thermocellum  and desulfotalea psychrophila suggest a new active site locking mechanism.
AB  == isocitrate dehydrogenase (idh) catalyzes the oxidative nad(p)(+)-dependent decarboxylation of isocitrate into alpha-ketoglutarate and co2 and is present in  organisms spanning the biological range of temperature. we have solved two crystal structures of the thermophilic clostridium thermocellum idh (ctidh), a native open apo ctidh to 2.35 a and a quaternary complex of ctidh with nadp(+), isocitrate and mg(2+) to 2.5 a. to compare to these a quaternary complex structure of the psychrophilic desulfotalea psychrophila idh (dpidh) was also resolved to 1.93 a. ctidh and dpidh showed similar global thermal stabilities with melting temperatures of 67.9 and 66.9 degrees c, respectively. ctidh represents a typical thermophilic enzyme, with a large number of ionic interactions and hydrogen bonds per residue combined with stabilization of the n  and c termini. ctidh had a higher activity temperature optimum, and showed greater affinity for the substrates with an active site that was less thermolabile compared to dpidh. the uncompensated negative surface charge and the enlarged methionine cluster in the hinge region both of which are important for cold activity in dpidh, were absent in ctidh. these structural comparisons revealed that prokaryotic idhs in subfamily ii have a unique locking mechanism involving arg310, asp251' and arg255 (ctidh). these interactions lock the large domain to the small domain and direct nadp(+) into the correct orientation, which together are important for nadp(+) selectivity.

TI  == functional characterization of the trigger factor protein pcet of tetrachloroethene-dechlorinating desulfitobacterium hafniense y51.
AB  == desulfitobacterium hafniense strain y51 dechlorinates tetrachloroethene to cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cis-dce) via trichloroethene by the action of the pcea reductive dehalogenase encoded by pcea. the pcea gene constitutes a gene cluster  with pceb, pcec, and pcet. however, the gene components, except for pcea, still remained to be characterized. in the present study, we characterized the function of pcet. pcet of strain y51 showed a sequence homology with trigger factor proteins, although it is evolutionally distant from the well-characterized trigger factor protein of escherichia coli. the pcet protein tagged with 6x histidine was expressed as a soluble form in e. coli. the recombinant pcet fusion protein exhibited peptidyl-proryl cis-trans isomerase activity toward the chromogenic peptide n-succinyl-ala-ala-pro-phe-p-nitroanilide. the pcet fusion protein also exhibited chaperon activity towards the chemically denatured citrate synthase. immunoprecipitation analysis using antibodies raised against pcea and pcet demonstrated that pcet specifically binds to the precursor form of pcea with an n-terminal twin-arginine translocation (tat) signal sequence. on the other hand, pcet failed to bind the mature form of pcea that lost the tat signal sequence. this is the first report in dehalorespiring bacteria, indicating that pcet is responsible for the correct folding of the precursor pcea.

TI  == pyrrolysyl-trna synthetase-trna(pyl) structure reveals the molecular basis of orthogonality.
AB  == pyrrolysine (pyl), the 22nd natural amino acid, is genetically encoded by uag and inserted into proteins by the unique suppressor trna(pyl) (ref. 1). the methanosarcinaceae produce pyl and express pyl-containing methyltransferases that allow growth on methylamines. homologous methyltransferases and the pyl biosynthetic and coding machinery are also found in two bacterial species. pyl coding is maintained by pyrrolysyl-trna synthetase (pylrs), which catalyses the formation of pyl-trna(pyl) (refs 4, 5). pyl is not a recent addition to the genetic code. pylrs was already present in the last universal common ancestor; it then persisted in organisms that utilize methylamines as energy sources. recent protein engineering efforts added non-canonical amino acids to the genetic code.  this technology relies on the directed evolution of an 'orthogonal' trna synthetase-trna pair in which an engineered aminoacyl-trna synthetase (aars) specifically and exclusively acylates the orthogonal trna with a non-canonical amino acid. for pyl the natural evolutionary process developed such a system some 3 billion years ago. when transformed into escherichia coli, methanosarcina barkeri pylrs and trna(pyl) function as an orthogonal pair in vivo. here we show  that desulfitobacterium hafniense pylrs-trna(pyl) is an orthogonal pair in vitro  and in vivo, and present the crystal structure of this orthogonal pair. the ancient emergence of pylrs-trna(pyl) allowed the evolution of unique structural features in both the protein and the trna. these structural elements manifest an  intricate, specialized aars-trna interaction surface that is highly distinct from those observed in any other known aars-trna complex; it is this general property  that underlies the molecular basis of orthogonality.

TI  == divergent roles of cprk paralogues from desulfitobacterium hafniense in activating gene expression.
AB  == gene duplication and horizontal gene transfer play an important role in the evolution of prokaryotic genomes. we have investigated the role of three cprk paralogues from the camp receptor protein-fumarate and nitrate reduction regulator (crp-fnr) family of transcriptional regulators that are encoded in the  genome of desulfitobacterium hafniense dcb-2 and possibly regulate expression of  genes involved in the energy-conserving terminal reduction of organohalides (halorespiration). the results from in vivo and in vitro promoter probe assays show that two regulators (cprk1 and cprk2) have an at least partially overlapping effector specificity, with preference for ortho-chlorophenols, while meta-chlorophenols proved to be effectors for cprk4. the presence of a potential  transposase-encoding gene in the vicinity of the cprk genes indicates that their  redundancy is probably caused by mobile genetic elements. the cprk paralogues activated transcription from promoters containing a 14 bp inverted repeat (dehalobox) that closely resembles the fnr-box. we found a strong negative correlation between the rate of transcriptional activation and the number of nucleotide changes from the optimal dehalobox sequence (ttaat-n4-attaa). transcription was initiated by cprk4 from a promoter that is situated upstream of a gene encoding a methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein. this might be the first indication of taxis of an anaerobic bacterium to halogenated aromatic compounds.

TI  == characterization of cprk1, a crp/fnr-type transcriptional regulator of halorespiration from desulfitobacterium hafniense.
AB  == the recently identified cprk branch of the crp (cyclic amp receptor protein)-fnr  (fumarate and nitrate reduction regulator) family of transcriptional regulators includes proteins that activate the transcription of genes encoding proteins involved in reductive dehalogenation of chlorinated aromatic compounds. here we report the characterization of the cprk1 protein from desulfitobacterium hafniense, an anaerobic low-g+c gram-positive bacterium that is capable of reductive dechlorination of 3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (cl-ohpa). the gene encoding cprk1 was cloned and functionally overexpressed in escherichia coli, and the protein was subsequently purified to homogeneity. to investigate the interaction of cprk1 with three of its predicted binding sequences (dehaloboxes), we performed in vitro dna-binding assays (electrophoretic mobility shift assays) as well as in vivo promoter probe assays. our results show that cprk1 binds its target dehaloboxes with high affinity (dissociation constant, 90  nm) in the presence of cl-ohpa and that transcriptional initiation by cprk1 is influenced by deviations in the dehaloboxes from the consensus ttaat----attaa sequence. a mutant cprk1 protein was created by a val-->glu substitution at a conserved position in the recognition alpha-helix that gained fnr-type dna-binding specificity, recognizing the ttgat----atcaa sequence (fnr box) instead of the dehaloboxes. cprk1 was subject to oxidative inactivation in vitro, most likely caused by the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bridge between cys11 and cys200. the possibility of redox regulation of cprk1 by a thiol-disulfide exchange reaction was investigated by using two cys-->ser mutants. our results indicate that a cys11-cys200 disulfide bridge does not appear to play a physiological role in the regulation of cprk1.

TI  == investigations on the solubility behavior of cyanophycin. solubility of cyanophycin in solutions of simple inorganic salts.
AB  == on the basis of a previous report on the occurrence of water-soluble cyanophycin  (cgp, cyanophycin granule polypeptide) in a recombinant strain of escherichia coli expressing the cyanophycin synthetase (cpha) of desulfitobacterium hafniense published by others, the conditions of its production were investigated in this study. although the incubation temperature, aeration level, and nacl concentration during cultivation had effects on the in vivo production of water-soluble cgp, it could be isolated as a major variant irrespective of the cultivation conditions. the occurrence of the soluble variant was also not dependent on the e. coli host or on the origin of cpha. furthermore, it was shown that water-insoluble cgp can be in vitro solubilized to extents of up to about 80% (w/w) in solutions of different inorganic salts such as licl, nacl, kcl, rbcl, kbr, mgcl(2), or cacl(2). evidence was obtained that the salt ions bind tightly to cgp. if the ions were not removed from the salt solution by dialysis or dilution, the cgp remained stable in solution. this method to solubilize water-insoluble cgp could also be applied to high concentrations of the polymer.  cgp that remained insoluble after the first treatment could only marginally be solubilized in following treatments. the polydisperse cgp molecules were solubilized to the same extent over the whole molecular weight range with no preference of a particular molecular weight.

TI  == cyanophycin synthetase-like enzymes of non-cyanobacterial eubacteria: characterization of the polymer produced by a recombinant synthetase of desulfitobacterium hafniense.
AB  == some bacterial genomes were found to contain genes encoding putative proteins with considerable sequence homology to cyanophycin synthetase cpha of cyanobacteria. such a gene from the gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobe desulfitobacterium hafniense was cloned. expression in escherichia coli resulted  in the formation of a polydispers copolymer of aspartic acid and arginine, with a minor amount of lysine, of about 30 kda molecular mass. in contrast to cyanophycin, this polymer was water-soluble. the structure of the polymer formed  by the synthetase from desulfitobacterium hafniense was studied by enzymatic degradation with the cyanophycin-specific hydrolase cyanophycinase, and by chemical and mass-spectroscopic analyses. despite of the differences in solubility, indicating that both polymers cannot be completely identical, the chemical structure was found to be very similar to that of cyanophycin. the results suggest that the use of cyanophycin-like polymers as a nitrogen-rich reserve material is not restricted to cyanobacteria, and that such polymers may not necessarily be stored in granules.

TI  == evaluation of non-cyanobacterial genome sequences for occurrence of genes encoding proteins homologous to cyanophycin synthetase and cloning of an active cyanophycin synthetase from acinetobacter sp. strain dsm 587.
AB  == all publicly accessible microbial genome databases were searched for the occurrence of genes encoding proteins homologous to the cyanophycin synthetase (cpha) of synechocystis sp. strain pcc 6803 in order to reveal the capability of  microorganisms not belonging to the cyanobacteria to synthesize cyanophycin. among 65 genome sequences, genes homologous to cpha were found in acinetobacter sp. strain adp1 (encoding a protein homologous to cpha with 40% amino acid identity), bordetella bronchiseptica strain rb50 (39%), bordetella pertussis strain tohama i (39%), bordetella parapertussis strain 12822 (39%), clostridium botulinum strain atcc 3502 (39%), desulfitobacterium hafniense strain dcb-2 (38%) and nitrosomonas europaea strain atcc 25978 (37%). the gene homologous to cpha from acinetobacter sp. strain dsm 587 was amplified by pcr, ligated to the vector pbluescript sk(-) downstream of the lac promoter and introduced into escherichia  coli. the recombinant strain of e. coli expressed cpha activity at up to 1.2 u/mg protein and accumulated cyanophycin to up to 7.5% of the cellular dry matter, indicating that cpha of acinetobacter sp. strain dsm 587 is functionally active.  in acinetobacter sp. strain dsm 587 itself, cyanophycin accumulated to up to 1.4% of the total protein under phosphate-limited conditions, and cyanophycin synthetase activity was detected, which indicated the function of cyanophycin as  a storage compound in this strain.
