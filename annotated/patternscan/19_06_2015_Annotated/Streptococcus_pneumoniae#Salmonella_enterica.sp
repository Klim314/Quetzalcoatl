TI  == molecular detection of fastidious and common bacteria as well as plasmodium spp.  in febrile and afebrile children in franceville, gabon.
AB  == malaria was considered as the main cause of fever in africa. however, with the roll back malaria initiative, the causes of fever in africa may change. this study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of bacteria and plasmodium spp. in febrile and afebrile (controls) children from franceville, gabon. about 793 blood samples from febrile children and 100 from controls were analyzed using polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) coupled with sequencing. plasmodium spp. was the microorganism most detected in febrile (74.5%, 591/793) and controls (13%, 13/100), p < 0.0001. its coinfection with bacteria was found only in febrile children (p = 0.0001). staphylococcus aureus was the most prevalent bacterium in febrile children (2.8%, 22/793) and controls (3%, 3/100). eight cases of salmonella spp. (including two salmonella enterica serovar paratyphi) and two of streptococcus pneumoniae were found only among febrile children. borrelia spp. was found in 2 controls while rickettsia felis was detected in 10 children (in 8 febriles and 2 afebriles). no  dna of other targeted microorganisms was detected. plasmodium spp. remains prevalent while salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae were common bacteria in gabon. two fastidious bacteria, rickettsia felis and borrelia spp., were found. inclusion of controls should improve the understanding of the causes of fever in sub-saharan africa.

TI  == management of severe non-tb bacterial infection in hiv-infected adults.
AB  == despite widespread antiretroviral therapy use, severe bacterial infections (sbi)  in hiv-infected adults continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality globally. four main pathogens account for the majority of documented sbi: streptococcus pneumoniae, non-typhoidal strains of salmonella enterica, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. the epidemiology of sbi is dynamic, both in developing countries where, despite dramatic successes in antiretroviral  therapy, coverage is far from complete, and in settings in both resource-poor and resource-rich countries where antiretroviral therapy failure is becoming increasingly common. throughout the world, this complexity is further compounded  by rapidly emerging antimicrobial resistance, making management of sbi very challenging in these vulnerable patients. we review the causes and treatment of sbi in hiv-infected people and discuss future developments in this field.

TI  == preparation and testing of a vi conjugate vaccine using pneumococcal surface protein a (pspa) from streptococcus pneumoniae as the carrier protein.
AB  == in the current study pneumococcal surface protein a (pspa) was conjugated to vi capsular polysaccharide from salmonella typhi to make available a vaccine against typhoid fever that has the potential to also provide broad protection from streptococcus pneumoniae. high yielding production processes were developed for the purification of pspas from families 1 and 2. the purified pspas were conjugated to vi with high recovery of both vi and pspa. the processes developed  especially for pspa family 2 could readily be adapted for large scale production  under cgmp conditions. previously we have shown that conjugation of diphtheria toxoid (dt) to vi polysaccharide improves the immune response to vi but can also  enhance the response to dt. in this study it was shown that conjugation of pspa to vi enhanced the anti-pspa response and that pspa was a suitable carrier protein as demonstrated by the characteristics of a t-cell dependent response to  the vi. we propose that a bivalent vaccine consisting of pspa from families 1 and 2 bound to vi polysaccharide would protect against typhoid fever and has the potential to also protect against pneumococcal disease and should be considered for use in developing countries.

TI  == bacterial meningitis in malawian infants <2 months of age: etiology and susceptibility to world health organization first-line antibiotics.
AB  == background: neonatal meningitis is an important cause of morbidity in sub-saharan africa and requires urgent empiric treatment with parenteral administered antibiotics. here we describe the etiology, antimicrobial susceptibility and suitability of the world health organization first-line recommended antibiotics (penicillin and gentamicin) for bacterial meningitis in young infants in malawi.  methods: we reviewed all cerebrospinal fluid samples received from infants </=2 months of age with clinically suspected meningitis between january 1, 2002, and december 31, 2008, at the queen elizabeth central hospital in blantyre, malawi. results: we identified 259 culture-positive isolates from 259 infants </=2 months of age. sixty isolates were from neonates </=7 days old, in whom the most common  pathogens were group b streptococcus (27/60; 45.0%), streptococcus pneumoniae (13/60; 21.7%) and nontyphoidal salmonella enterica (7/60; 11.7%). one hundred and ninety one isolates were from young infants who were >7 days and </=2 months  of age. in this group, the most common isolates were s. pneumoniae (80/191; 41.9%), group b streptococcus (38/191; 19.9%) and nontyphoidal salmonella enterica (34/191; 17.8%). more isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone than to the combination of penicillin and gentamicin (218/220; 99.1% vs. 202/220; 91.8%,  fisher's exact test p = 0.006). in particular, gram-negative isolates were significantly more susceptible to ceftriaxone than to gentamicin (72/74; 97.3% vs. 63/74; 85.1%, fisher's exact test p = 0.020). penicillin and gentamicin provided less coverage for gram-negative than gram-positive isolates (74/86; 86.0% vs. 155/163; 95.1%, chi = 6.24, p = 0.012). conclusions: in view of these results, the world health organization recommendations for empiric penicillin and gentamicin for suspected neonatal meningitis should be reevaluated.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == a phase i, dose-escalation trial in adults of three recombinant attenuated salmonella typhi vaccine vectors producing streptococcus pneumoniae surface protein antigen pspa.
AB  == background: live, attenuated, orally-administered salmonella strains are excellent vectors for vaccine antigens and are attractive as vaccines based on previous use of s. typhimurium in animals. a phase i dose escalation trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of three newly constructed recombinant attenuated salmonella enterica serovar typhi vaccine (rasv) vectors synthesizing streptococcus pneumoniae surface protein a (pspa). methods: the 3 s. typhi strains used as vectors to deliver pspa were s. typhi isp1820; s. typhi ty2 rpos(-); and s. typhi ty2 rpos(+). sixty healthy adults (median age 25.2 years) were enrolled into 4 arms (total 15 subjects per arm); within each arm, subjects  were randomized 1:1:1 into 3 groups of 5. all subjects in the same group received the same vaccine vector, and all subjects in the same arm received the same titer of vaccine (10(7), 10(8), 10(9) or 10(10)cfu). adverse events, safety, shedding,  and igg and iga titers against salmonella outer membrane proteins (omps), lipopolysaccharide (lps) and pspa were evaluated. results: in the highest dose group, no subject experienced severe reactions or serious adverse events. most adverse events were mild; one subject had a positive blood culture. no subject shed vaccine in stool. no statistically significant differences for post vaccination elisa or elispot results between groups were detected. however, a limited number of >/= 4 fold increases from baseline for iga anti-omps, iga and igg anti-lps, and iga anti-pspa occurred for a few individuals as measured by elisa, and iga anti-omps as measured by elispot assay. conclusions: all three s.  typhi vectored pneumococcal vaccines were safe and well-tolerated. immunogenicity was limited possibly due to pre-existing high antibody titers prior to vaccination. increases in iga were most often observed.

TI  == on-chip microbial culture for the specific detection of very low levels of bacteria.
AB  == microbial culture continues to be the most common protocol for bacterial detection and identification in medicine and agronomics. using this process may take days to identify a specific pathogen for most bacterial strains. surface plasmon resonance (spr) detection is an emerging alternative technology that can  be used for the detection of bacteria using protein microarrays although typical  limits of detection are in the range of 10(3)-10(6) cfu ml(-1), which is not compatible with most food safety regulation requirements. in this work, we combine concomitant "on-chip" microbial culture with sensitive spr detection of bacteria thus allowing rapid specific detection of bacteria pathogens - including salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, streptococcus pneumoniae and escherichia coli o157:h7 - cultured on a protein microarray. this culture-capture-measure (ccm) approach significantly decreases both the number of processing steps and the overall assay time for bacterial detection. signal analysis of spr responses  allowed the fast and quantitative assessment of bacterial concentrations initially present in the sample as low as 2.8 +/- 19.6 cfu per milliliter. altogether, our results show how simple, easy-to-operate, fluidic-less and lo-tec microarrays can be used with unprocessed samples and yield - in a single assay -  both qualitative and quantitative information regarding bacterial contamination.

TI  == multiple antigen-presenting system (maps) to induce comprehensive b- and t-cell immunity.
AB  == vaccines are among the most effective approaches to prevent and control many infectious diseases. because of safety and reproducibility concerns, whole-cell vaccines (wcvs), made from live or killed microorganisms and including hundreds of antigenic components, have been mostly replaced by acellular or subunit vaccines composed of well-defined, purified antigen components. the efficacy of acellular vaccines is inferior to that of wcvs, however, for two major reasons: limited antigen diversity and reduced immunogenicity, especially in a lack of activation of antigen-specific t-cell immunity, which plays an important role in  protection against mucosal and intracellular pathogens. here we present the multiple antigen-presenting system (maps), which enables the creation of a macromolecular complex that mimics the properties of wcvs by integrating various  antigen components, including polysaccharides and proteins, in the same construct and that induces multipronged immune responses, including antibody, th1, and th17 responses. using antigens from various pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae, salmonella typhi, and mycobacterium tuberculosis), we demonstrate the versatility of the maps system and its feasibility for the design of unique defined-structure subunit vaccines to confer comprehensive protection via multiple immune mechanisms. moreover, maps can serve as a tool for structure-activity analysis of cellular immunogens.

TI  == evaluation of regulated delayed attenuation strategies for salmonella enterica serovar typhi vaccine vectors in neonatal and infant mice.
AB  == we developed regulated delayed attenuation strategies for salmonella vaccine vectors. in this study, we evaluated the combination of these strategies in recombinant attenuated salmonella enterica serovar typhi and salmonella enterica  serovar typhimurium vaccine vectors with similar genetic backgrounds in vitro and in vivo. our goal is to develop a vaccine to prevent streptococcus pneumoniae infection in newborns; thus, all strains delivered a pneumococcal antigen pspa and the impact of maternal antibodies was evaluated. the results showed that all  strains with the regulated delayed attenuated phenotype (rdap) displayed an invasive ability stronger than that of the s. typhi vaccine strain, ty21a, but weaker than that of their corresponding wild-type parental strains. the survival  curves of different rdap vaccine vectors in vitro and in vivo exhibited diverse regulated delayed attenuation kinetics, which was different from s. typhi ty21a and the wild-type parental strains. under the influence of maternal antibody, the persistence of the s. typhimurium rdap strain displayed a regulated delayed attenuation trend in nasal lymphoid tissue (nalt), lung, and peyer's patches, while the persistence of s. typhi rdap strains followed the curve only in nalt. the bacterial loads of s. typhi rdap strains were lower in nalt, lung, and peyer's patches in mice born to immune mothers than in those born to naive mothers. in accordance with these results, rdap vaccine strains induced high titers of igg antibodies against pspa and against salmonella lipopolysaccharides. immunization of mothers with s. typhi rdap strains enhanced the level of vaginal  mucosal iga, gamma interferon (ifn-gamma), and interleukin 4 (il-4) and resulted  in a higher level of protection against s. pneumoniae challenge.

TI  == a prospective study of the causes of febrile illness requiring hospitalization in children in cambodia.
AB  == background: febrile illnesses are pre-eminent contributors to morbidity and mortality among children in south-east asia but the causes are poorly understood. we determined the causes of fever in children hospitalised in siem reap province, cambodia. methods and findings: a one-year prospective study of febrile children  admitted to angkor hospital for children, siem reap. demographic, clinical, laboratory and outcome data were comprehensively analysed. between october 12(th) 2009 and october 12(th) 2010 there were 1225 episodes of febrile illness in 1180  children. median (iqr) age was 2.0 (0.8-6.4) years, with 850 (69%) episodes in children <5 years. common microbiological diagnoses were dengue virus (16.2%), scrub typhus (7.8%), and japanese encephalitis virus (5.8%). 76 (6.3%) episodes had culture-proven bloodstream infection, including salmonella enterica serovar typhi (22 isolates, 1.8%), streptococcus pneumoniae (13, 1.1%), escherichia coli  (8, 0.7%), haemophilus influenzae (7, 0.6%), staphylococcus aureus (6, 0.5%) and  burkholderia pseudomallei (6, 0.5%). there were 69 deaths (5.6%), including those due to clinically diagnosed pneumonia (19), dengue virus (5), and melioidosis (4). 10 of 69 (14.5%) deaths were associated with culture-proven bloodstream infection in logistic regression analyses (odds ratio for mortality 3.4, 95% ci 1.6-6.9). antimicrobial resistance was prevalent, particularly in s. enterica typhi, (where 90% of isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, and 86% were multi-drug resistant). comorbid undernutrition was present in 44% of episodes and a major risk factor for acute mortality (or 2.1, 95% ci 1.1-4.2), as were hiv infection and cardiac disease. conclusion: we identified a microbiological cause  of fever in almost 50% of episodes in this large study of community-acquired febrile illness in hospitalized children in cambodia. the range of pathogens, antimicrobial susceptibility, and co-morbidities associated with mortality described will be of use in the development of rational guidelines for infectious disease treatment and control in cambodia and south-east asia.

TI  == cd137 expressed on neutrophils plays dual roles in antibacterial responses against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections.
AB  == severe sepsis and septic shock caused mainly by bacterial infections are life-threatening conditions that urge the development of novel therapies. however, host responses to and pathophysiology of sepsis have not been clearly understood, which remains a major obstacle for the development of effective therapeutics. recently, we have shown that stimulation of a costimulatory molecule, cd137, enhanced survival of mice infected with the gram-positive (g(+)) intracellular bacterium listeria monocytogenes but decreased survival in a polymicrobial sepsis model. herein, we report that cd137 deficiency or blocking of cd137 signaling decreased antibacterial responses of mice infected with g(+) bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis) but increased these responses in mice infected with gram-negative (g(-)) bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium). consistent with these findings, stimulation of cd137 by administration of agonistic antibody enhanced responses against g(+) bacteria, whereas it decreased these responses against g(-) bacteria. neutrophils were responsible for cd137-mediated opposite roles in control of g(+) and g(-) bacterial infections. stimulation of cd137 enhanced activities of neutrophils against s. aureus but decreased these activities against e. coli, while cd137 blocking produced opposite results with the stimulation of cd137 in vivo and in vitro. furthermore, we found that combined signaling of cd137 and toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) induced synergistic production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-6 (il-6) by neutrophils, but combined signaling of cd137 and tlr4 did not. our data strongly suggest that cd137 may play a dual role in sepsis in association with tlrs.

TI  == bloodstream infection among children presenting to a general hospital outpatient  clinic in urban nepal.
AB  == background: there are limited data on the etiology and characteristics of bloodstream infections in children presenting in hospital outpatient settings in  south asia. previous studies in nepal have highlighted the importance of murine typhus as a cause of febrile illness in adults and enteric fever as a leading bacterial cause of fever among children admitted to hospital. methods: we prospectively studied a total of 1084 febrile children aged between 2 months and  14 years presenting to a general hospital outpatient department in kathmandu valley, nepal, over two study periods (summer and winter). blood from all patients was tested by conventional culture and by real-time pcr for rickettsia typhi. results: putative etiological agents for fever were identified in 164 (15%) patients. salmonella enterica serovar typhi (s. typhi) was identified in 107 (10%), s. enterica serovar paratyphi a (s. paratyphi) in 30 (3%), streptococcus pneumoniae in 6 (0.6%), s. enterica serovar typhimurium in 2 (0.2%), haemophilus influenzae type b in 1 (0.1%), and escherichia coli in 1 (0.1%) patient. s. typhi was the most common organism isolated from blood during  both summer and winter. twenty-two (2%) patients were pcr positive for r. typhi.  no significant demographic, clinical and laboratory features distinguished culture positive enteric fever and murine typhus. conclusions: salmonella infections are the leading cause of bloodstream infection among pediatric outpatients with fever in kathmandu valley. extension of immunization programs against invasive bacterial disease to include the agents of enteric fever and pneumococcus could improve the health of children in nepal.

TI  == diverse phosphorylation patterns of b cell receptor-associated signaling in naive and memory human b cells revealed by phosphoflow, a powerful technique to study signaling at the single cell level.
AB  == following interaction with cognate antigens, b cells undergo cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation. ligation of the b cell receptor (bcr) leads to the phosphorylation of bcr-associated signaling proteins within minutes of antigen binding, a process with profound consequences for the fate of the cells and development of effector immunity. phosphoflow allows a rapid evaluation of various signaling pathways in complex heterogenous cell subsets. this novel technique was used in combination with multi-chromatic flow cytometry (fc) and fluorescent-cell barcoding (fcb) to study phosphorylation of bcr-associated signaling pathways in naive and memory human b cell subsets. proteins of the initiation (syk), propagation (btk, akt), and integration (p38mapk and erk1/2) signaling units were studied. switched memory (sm) cd27+ and sm cd27- phosphorylation patterns were similar when stimulated with anti-iga or -igg. in contrast, naive and unswitched memory (um) cells showed significant differences following igm stimulation. enhanced phosphorylation of syk was observed in um cells, suggesting a lower activation threshold. this is likely the result of higher amounts of igm on the cell surface, higher pan-syk levels, and enhanced susceptibility to phosphatase inhibition. all other signaling proteins evaluated  also showed some degree of enhanced phosphorylation in um cells. furthermore, both the phospholipase c-gamma2 (plc-gamma2) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k) pathways were activated in um cells, while only the pi3k pathway was activated on naive cells. um cells were the only ones that activated signaling pathways when stimulated with fluorescently labeled s. typhi and s. pneumoniae. finally, simultaneous evaluation of signaling proteins at the single cell level (multiphosphorylated cells) revealed that interaction with gram positive and negative bacteria resulted in complex and diverse signaling patterns. phosphoflow holds great potential to accelerate vaccine development by identifying signaling  profiles in good/poor responders.

TI  == the asd(+)-dadb(+) dual-plasmid system offers a novel means to deliver multiple protective antigens by a recombinant attenuated salmonella vaccine.
AB  == we developed means to deliver multiple heterologous antigens on dual plasmids with non-antibiotic-resistance markers in a single recombinant attenuated vaccine strain of salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium. the first component of this delivery system is a strain of s. typhimurium carrying genomic deletions in alr,  dadb, and asd, resulting in obligate requirements for diaminopimelic acid (dap) and d-alanine for growth. the second component is the asd(+)-dadb(+) plasmid pair carrying wild-type copies of asda and dadb, respectively, to complement the mutations. to evaluate the protection efficacy of the dual-plasmid vaccine, s. typhimurium strain chi9760 (a strain with multiple attenuating mutations: deltaasd deltaalr deltadadb deltarecf) was transformed with asd(+) and dadb(+) plasmids specifying pneumococcal antigens pspa and pspc, respectively. both plasmids were stable in chi9760 for 50 generations when grown in nonselective medium. this was significantly (p < 0.05) greater than the stability seen in its  recf(+) counterpart chi9590 and could be attributed to reduced interplasmid recombination in chi9760. oral immunization of balb/c mice with 1 x 10(9) cfu of  chi9760 (carrying asd(+)-pspa and dadb(+)-pspc plasmids) elicited a dominant th1-type serum igg response against both antigens and protected mice against intraperitoneal challenge with 200 50% lethal doses (ld(50)s) of virulent streptococcus pneumoniae strain wu2 or intravenous challenge with 100 ld(50)s of  virulent s. pneumoniae strain l81905 or intranasal challenge with a lethal dose of s. pneumoniae a66.1 in a pneumonia model. protection offered by chi9760 was superior to that offered by the mixture of two strains, chi9828 (asd(+)-pspa) and chi11026 (dadb(+)-pspc). this novel dual-plasmid system marks a remarkable improvement in the development of live bacterial vaccines.

TI  == phosphate groups of lipid a are essential for salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium virulence and affect innate and adaptive immunity.
AB  == lipid a is a key component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria and stimulates proinflammatory responses via the toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4)-md2-cd14 pathway. its endotoxic activity depends on the number and length of acyl chains and its phosphorylation state. in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, removal of the secondary laurate or myristate chain in lipid a results in bacterial attenuation and growth defects in vitro. however, the roles of the two  lipid a phosphate groups in bacterial virulence and immunogenicity remain unknown. here, we used an s. typhimurium msbb pagl pagp lpxr mutant, carrying penta-acylated lipid a, as the parent strain to construct a series of mutants synthesizing 1-dephosphorylated, 4'-dephosphorylated, or nonphosphorylated penta-acylated lipid a. dephosphorylated mutants exhibited increased sensitivity  to deoxycholate and showed increased resistance to polymyxin b. removal of both phosphate groups severely attenuated the mutants when administered orally to balb/c mice, but the mutants colonized the lymphatic tissues and were sufficiently immunogenic to protect the host from challenge with wild-type s. typhimurium. mice receiving s. typhimurium with 1-dephosphorylated or nonphosphorylated penta-acylated lipid a exhibited reduced levels of cytokines. attenuated and dephosphorylated salmonella vaccines were able to induce adaptive  immunity against heterologous (pspa of streptococcus pneumoniae) and homologous antigens (lipopolysaccharide [lps] and outer membrane proteins [omps]).

TI  == sialidase specificity determined by chemoselective modification of complex sialylated glycans.
AB  == sialidases hydrolytically remove sialic acids from sialylated glycoproteins and glycolipids. sialidases are widely distributed in nature and sialidase-mediated desialylation is implicated in normal and pathological processes. however, mechanisms by which sialidases exert their biological effects remain obscure, in  part because sialidase substrate preferences are poorly defined. here we report the design and implementation of a sialidase substrate specificity assay based on chemoselective labeling of sialosides. we show that this assay identifies components of glycosylated substrates that contribute to sialidase specificity. we demonstrate that specificity of sialidases can depend on structure of the underlying glycan, a characteristic difficult to discern using typical sialidase  assays. moreover, we discovered that streptococcus pneumoniae sialidase nanc strongly prefers sialosides containing the neu5ac form of sialic acid versus those that contain neu5gc. we propose using this approach to evaluate sialidase preferences for diverse potential substrates.

TI  == community-acquired bacterial bloodstream infections in developing countries in south and southeast asia: a systematic review.
AB  == information about community-acquired bacteraemia in developing countries in south and southeast asia is scarce. we aimed to establish the case fraction of bacteraemia in febrile patients admitted to hospital. we searched four databases  and identified studies of south and southeast asia published between 1990 and 2010 that prospectively assessed patients admitted to hospital and from whom a blood culture was taken. we reviewed 17 eligible studies describing 40,644 patients. pathogenic organisms were isolated from 3506 patients (9%; range 1-51%); 1784 (12%) of 14,386 adults and 1722 (7%) of 26,258 children. salmonella  enterica serotype typhi was the most common bacterial pathogen, accounting for 532 of 1798 (30%) isolates in adults and 432 of 1723 (25%) in children. other commonly isolated organisms in adults were staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and other gram-negative organisms, and in children were streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. a substantial case fraction of bacteraemia occurs in patients admitted to hospital with fever in this region. management could be improved if diagnostic microbiology facilities were more widely available. the prevailing organisms causing bacteraemia and their susceptibility  patterns could inform empirical treatment regimens and prevention strategies.

AB  == pneumococcal and salmonella typhi infections are two major diseases for children  in developing countries. for typhoid fever, licensed vi polysaccharide vaccines are ineffective in children <2-year old. while investigational vi conjugate vaccines have been shown effective in clinical trials, they are currently only available to restricted areas. pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide conjugate vaccines are highly effective in children, but suffer from some limitations including cost and limited serotype coverage. we have previously shown that a fusion conjugate vaccine, consisting of pneumococcal fusion protein psaa and pneumolysoid (pdt) conjugated to a polysaccharide, results in enhanced antibody and cd4+ th17 cell responses as well as protection against pneumococcal colonization and disease in mice. here we applied this approach to develop a bivalent vaccine against pneumococcus and s. typhi. two species-conserved pneumococcal antigens (sp1572 or sp2070) were fused to the nonhemolytic pneumolysoid pdt. sp1572-pdt was then conjugated to vi polysaccharide and sp2070-pdt was conjugated to the pneumococcal cell wall polysaccharide (cwps; also conserved). mice immunized with this bivalent conjugate were protected against pneumococcal colonization and sepsis challenges, and made anti-vi antibody concentrations higher by 40-fold compared to mice that received equimolar mixtures of the antigens. an enhanced killing of vi-bearing salmonellae in vitro was demonstrated from plasma of mice that received the fusion conjugate  but not the mixture of antigens. our results support further evaluation of this bivalent immunogen for the prevention of pneumococcal colonization and disease, and of typhoid fever.

TI  == antimicrobial and safety properties of lactobacilli isolated from two cameroonian traditional fermented foods.
AB  == twenty-one lactobacillus isolates from "sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. these isolates were preliminarily identified as lactobacillus plantarum (62%), lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-pcr genomic fingerprinting. twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, proteinase k) and inhibition of other lactobacillus spp. these  bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin g, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. the bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria,  several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the world health organization, as well as multidrug-resistant strains. these include staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare typhi, bacillus cereus, streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella pneumoniae and shigella flexneri. these lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.

TI  == antibacterial activity of clarithromycin loaded plga nanoparticles.
AB  == novel drug delivery systems such as nanoparticles (nps) have been proved to enhance the effectiveness of many drugs. clarithromycin is a broad spectrum macrolide antibiotic, used in many infectious conditions like upper and lower respiratory tract infections, and skin and other soft tissue infections. this paper describes the preparation and enhanced in vitro antibacterial activities of clarithromycin loaded poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (plga) nanoparticles. a modified quasi-emulsion solvent diffusion (mqesd) method was used to prepare clarithromycin (clr) nps. the antibacterial activity of the nps was evaluated using the agar well diffusion method against escherichia coli (ptcc 1330), haemophilus influenzae (ptcc 1623), salmonella typhi (ptcc 1609), staphylococcus  aureus (ptcc 1112) and streptococcus pneumoniae (ptcc 1240). the inhibition zone  diameters related to each nano formulation were compared with those for untreated clr at the same concentrations. the results indicated that the mean inhibition zone diameters of nps against all the bacteria tested were significantly higher than those of untreated clr, particularly in the case of s. aureus. the increased potency of clr nps may be related to some physicochemical properties of nps like  modified surface characteristics, lower drug degradation, and increased drug adsorption and uptake.

TI  == inhibition of bacterial carbonic anhydrases and zinc proteases: from orphan targets to innovative new antibiotic drugs.
AB  == zinc-containing enzymes, such as carbonic anhydrases (cas) and metalloproteases (mps) play critical functions in bacteria, being involved in various steps of their life cycle, which are important for survival, colonization, acquisition of  nutrients for growth and proliferation, facilitation of dissemination, invasion and pathogenicity. the development of resistance to many classes of clinically used antibiotics emphasizes the need of new antibacterial drug targets to be explored. there is a wealth of data regarding bacterial cas and zinc mps present  in many pathogenic species, such as neisseria spp., helycobacter pylori escherichia coli, mycobacterium tuberculosis, brucella spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, haemophilus influenzae, listeria spp, vibrio spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, legionella pneumophila, streptomyces spp., clostridium spp., enterococcus spp., etc. some of these enzymes have been cloned, purified and characterized by crystallographic techniques. however, for the moment, few potent and specific inhibitors for bacterial mps have been reported except for clostridium histolyticum collagenase, botulinum and tetanus neurotoxin and anthrax lethal factor, which will be reviewed in this article. bacteria encode alpha-,beta-, and/or gamma-ca families, but up to now only the first two classes have been investigated in some detail in different species. the alpha-cas from neisseria spp. and h. pylori as well as the beta-class enzymes from e. coli, h. pylori, m. tuberculosis, brucella spp., s. pneumoniae, s. enterica and h. influenzae have been cloned and characterized. the catalytic/inhibition mechanisms of these cas are well understood as x-ray crystal structures are available for some of them, but no adducts of these enzymes with inhibitors have  been characterized so far. in vitro and in vivo studies with various classes of inhibitors, such as anions, sulfonamides and sulfamates have been reported. only  for neisseria spp., h. pylori, b. suis and s. pneumoniae cas it has been possible to evidence inhibition of bacterial growth in vivo. thus, bacterial cas and mps represent at this moment very promising targets for obtaining antibacterials devoid of the resistance problems of the clinically used such agents but further  studies are needed to validate these and other less investigated enzymes as novel drug targets.

TI  == palmitoylation state impacts induction of innate and acquired immunity by the salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium msbb mutant.
AB  == lipopolysaccharide (lps), composed of lipid a, core, and o-antigen, is a major virulence factor of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, with lipid a being a major stimulator to induce the proinflammatory response via the toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4)-md2-cd14 pathway. while salmonella msbb mutants lacking the myristate chain in lipid a were investigated widely as an anticancer vaccine, inclusion of the msbb mutation in a salmonella vaccine to deliver heterologous antigens has not yet been investigated. we introduced the msbb mutation alone or  in combination with mutations in other lipid a acyl chain modification genes encoding pagl, pagp, and lpxr into wild-type s. enterica serovar typhimurium. the msbb mutation reduced virulence, while the pagl, pagp, and lpxr mutations did not affect virulence in the msbb mutant background when administered orally to balb/c mice. also, all mutants exhibited sensitivity to polymyxin b but did not display  sensitivity to deoxycholate. lps derived from msbb mutants induced less inflammatory responses in human mono mac 6 and murine macrophage raw264.7 cells in vitro. however, an msbb mutant did not decrease the induction of inflammatory  responses in mice compared to the levels induced by the wild-type strain, whereas an msbb pagp mutant induced less inflammatory responses in vivo. the mutations were moved to an attenuated salmonella vaccine strain to evaluate their effects on immunogenicity. lipid a modification caused by the msbb mutation alone and in  combination with pagl, pagp, and lpxr mutations led to higher iga production in the vaginal tract but still retained the same igg titer level in serum to pspa, a test antigen from streptococcus pneumoniae, and to outer membrane proteins (omps) from salmonella.

TI  == rapid biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles from bacillus megaterium (ncim 2326) and their antibacterial activity on multi drug resistant clinical pathogens.
AB  == the notion to fight against multi drug resistant pathogens is a great deal in the field of nanomedicine. the identifiable antimicrobial action of metal bionanoparticles on many microorganisms is reported earlier. as silver bionanoparticles (ag-bnps) are known to have efficient antibacterial properties they are synthesized in ecofriendly and biocompatible way. the present study is focused on the extracellular biosynthesis of highly stable ag-bnps from bacterial strain bacillus megaterium (ncim 2326) by bio-reduction of silver ion using the culture supernatant, and to determine the antibacterial efficacy on multi drug resistant clinical pathogens such as streptococcus pneumoniae and salmonella typhi. the biosynthesis process is rapid and ag-bnps are formed within few minutes if agno(3) comes to contact with cell filtrate. furthermore the synthesized ag-bnps are characterized by uv-vis spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (afm), thin layer chromatography (tlc) and fourier transform infrared  spectroscopy (ftir).

TI  == bacterial carbonic anhydrases as drug targets: toward novel antibiotics?
AB  == carbonic anhydrases (cas, ec 4.2.1.1) are metalloenzymes which catalyze the hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons. many pathogenic bacteria  encode such enzymes belonging to the alpha-, beta-, and/or gamma-ca families. in  the last decade, the alpha-cas from neisseria spp. and helicobacter pylori as well as the beta-class enzymes from escherichia coli, h. pylori,mycobacterium tuberculosis, brucella spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, and haemophilus influenzae have been cloned and characterized in detail. for some of  these enzymes the x-ray crystal structures were determined, and in vitro and in vivo inhibition studies with various classes of inhibitors, such as anions, sulfonamides and sulfamates reported. although efficient inhibitors have been reported for many such enzymes, only for neisseria spp., h. pylori, b. suis, and  s. pneumoniae enzymes it has been possible to evidence inhibition of bacterial growth in vivo. thus, bacterial cas represent promising targets for obtaining antibacterials devoid of the resistance problems of the clinically used such agents but further studies are needed to validate these and other less investigated enzymes as novel drug targets.

TI  == effect of deletion of genes involved in lipopolysaccharide core and o-antigen synthesis on virulence and immunogenicity of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.
AB  == lipopolysaccharide (lps) is a major virulence factor of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and is composed of lipid a, core oligosaccharide (c-os), and  o-antigen polysaccharide (o-ps). while the functions of the gene products involved in synthesis of core and o-antigen have been elucidated, the effect of removing o-antigen and core sugars on the virulence and immunogenicity of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium has not been systematically studied. we introduced nonpolar, defined deletion mutations in waag (rfag), waai (rfai), rfah, waaj (rfaj), wbap (rfbp), waal (rfal), or wzy (rfc) into wild-type s. typhimurium. the lps structure was confirmed, and a number of in vitro and in vivo properties of each mutant were analyzed. all mutants were significantly attenuated compared to the wild-type parent when administered orally to balb/c mice and were less invasive in host tissues. strains with deltawaag and deltawaai mutations, in particular, were deficient in colonization of peyer's patches and liver. this deficiency could be partially overcome in the deltawaai mutant when it was administered intranasally. in the context of an attenuated vaccine strain  delivering the pneumococcal antigen pspa, all of the mutations tested resulted in reduced immune responses against pspa and salmonella antigens. our results indicate that nonreversible truncation of the outer core is not a viable option for developing a live oral salmonella vaccine, while a wzy mutant that retains one o-antigen unit is adequate for stimulating the optimal protective immunity to homologous or heterologous antigens by oral, intranasal, or intraperitoneal routes of administration.

TI  == susceptibility of bacterial isolates from community-acquired infections in sub-saharan africa and asia to macrolide antibiotics.
AB  == objective: to review the literature on the susceptibility of common community pathogens in sub-saharan africa and asia to the macrolide antibiotics. methods: inclusion criteria required that isolates were collected since 2004 to ensure results were of contemporary relevance. the data were aggregated by region, age group and sterility of site of culture sample. results: a total of 51 studies were identified, which reported the macrolide antimicrobial susceptibilities of common bacterial pathogens isolated since 2004. in general, there was less macrolide resistance in african than in asian isolates. most african studies reported high levels of macrolide susceptibility in streptococcus pneumoniae, whereas most chinese studies reported high levels of resistance. there was very little information available for gram-negative organisms. conclusions: susceptibility of the pneumococcus to macrolides in ssa remains high in many areas, and good activity of azithromycin has been shown against salmonellae spp.  in asia. in urban areas where high antibiotic consumption is prevalent, there was evidence of increased resistance to macrolides. however, there is no information  on susceptibility from large areas in both continents.

TI  == salmonella synthesizing 1-dephosphorylated [corrected] lipopolysaccharide exhibits low endotoxic activity while retaining its immunogenicity.
AB  == the development of safe live, attenuated salmonella vaccines may be facilitated by detoxification of its lps. recent characterization of the lipid a 1-phosphatase, lpxe, from francisella tularensis allowed us to construct recombinant, plasmid-free strains of salmonella that produce predominantly 1-dephosphorylated lipid a, similar to the adjuvant approved for human use. complete lipid a 1-dephosphorylation was also confirmed under low ph, low mg(2+)  culture conditions, which induce lipid a modifications. lpxe expression in salmonella reduced its virulence in mice by five orders of magnitude. moreover, mice inoculated with these detoxified strains were protected against wild-type challenge. candidate salmonella vaccine strains synthesizing pneumococcal surface protein a (pspa) were also confirmed to possess nearly complete lipid a 1-dephosphorylation. after inoculation by the lpxe/pspa strains, mice produced robust levels of anti-pspa abs and showed significantly improved survival against challenge with wild-type streptococcus pneumoniae wu2 compared with vector-only-immunized mice, validating salmonella synthesizing 1-dephosphorylated lipid a as an ag-delivery system.

TI  == n-benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines are a new class of bacterial dna gyrase inhibitors.
AB  == this paper characterizes n-benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines (gyramides) as dna gyrase inhibitors. gyramide a was previously shown to exhibit antimicrobial activity that suggested it inhibited bacterial cell division. in this study, we conducted target identification studies and identified dna gyrase as the primary  target of gyramide a. the gyramide a resistance-determining region in dna gyrase  is adjacent to the dna cleavage gate and is a new site for inhibitor design. we studied the antibiotic effects of gyramides a-c in combination with the gram-negative efflux pump inhibitor mc-207,110 (60 mum). the gyramides had a minimum inhibitory concentration of 10-40 mum against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae; the compounds were ineffective against enterococcus faecalis. the ic(50) of gyramides a-c against e. coli dna gyrase was 0.7- 3.3 mum. the n-benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines described in this manuscript represent a starting point for development of antibiotics that bind a new site in dna gyrase.

TI  == ultra-fast and sensitive detection of non-typhoidal salmonella using microwave-accelerated metal-enhanced fluorescence ("mamef").
AB  == certain serovars of salmonella enterica subsp. enterica cause invasive disease (e.g., enteric fever, bacteremia, septicemia, meningitis, etc.) in humans and constitute a global public health problem. a rapid, sensitive diagnostic test is  needed to allow prompt initiation of therapy in individual patients and for measuring disease burden at the population level. an innovative and promising new rapid diagnostic technique is microwave-accelerated metal-enhanced fluorescence (mamef). we have adapted this assay platform to detect the chromosomal oric locus common to all salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovars. we have shown efficient lysis of biologically relevant concentrations of salmonella spp. suspended in bacteriological media using microwave-induced lysis. following lysis and dna release, as little as 1 cfu of salmonella in 1 ml of medium can be detected in <30 seconds. furthermore the assay is sensitive and specific: it can  detect oric from salmonella serovars typhi, paratyphi a, paratyphi b, paratyphi c, typhimurium, enteritidis and choleraesuis but does not detect escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae or acinetobacter baumanii. we have also performed preliminary experiments using a synthetic salmonella oric oligonucleotide suspended in whole human blood and observed rapid detection when the sample was diluted 1:1 with pbs. these pre-clinical data encourage progress to the next step to detect salmonella in blood (and other ordinarily sterile, clinically relevant  body fluids).

AB  == objective: to describe the contribution of paediatric hiv and of hiv co-infections to admissions to a hospital in moshi, tanzania, using contemporary  laboratory methods. methods: during 1 year, we enrolled consecutively admitted patients aged >/=2 months and <13 years with current or recent fever. all patients underwent standardized clinical history taking, a physical examination and hiv antibody testing; standard aerobic blood cultures and malaria film were also done, and hospital outcome was recorded. early infant hiv diagnosis by hiv-1 rna pcr was performed on those aged <18 months. hiv-infected patients also received serum cryptococcal antigen testing and had their cd4-positive t-lymphocyte count and percent determined. results: a total of 467 patients were  enrolled whose median age was 2 years (range 2 months-13 years); of those patients, 57.2% were female and 12.2% were hiv-infected. admission clinical diagnosis of hiv disease was made in 10.7% and of malaria in 60.4%. of blood cultures, 5.8% grew pathogens; of these 25.9% were salmonella enterica (including 6 salmonella typhi) and 22.2%streptococcus pneumoniae. plasmodium falciparum was  identified on blood film of 1.3%. hiv infection was associated with s. pneumoniae (odds ratio 25.7, 95% ci 2.8, 234.0) bloodstream infection (bsi), but there was no evidence of an association with escherichia coli or p. falciparum; salmonella  typhi bsi occurred only among hiv-uninfected participants. the sensitivity and specificity of an admission clinical diagnosis of malaria were 100% and 40.3%; and for an admission diagnosis of bloodstream infection, they were 9.1% and 86.4%, respectively. conclusion: streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of bloodstream infection among paediatric admissions in tanzania and is closely associated with hiv infection. malaria was over-diagnosed clinically, whereas invasive bacterial disease was underestimated. hiv and hiv co-infections contribute to a substantial proportion of paediatric febrile admissions, underscoring the value of routine hiv testing.

TI  == high burden of antimicrobial resistance in asia.

TI  == immunization with salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium-derived outer membrane  vesicles delivering the pneumococcal protein pspa confers protection against challenge with streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == gram-negative bacteria produce outer membrane vesicles (omvs) that serve a variety of functions related to survival and pathogenicity. periplasmic and outer membrane proteins are naturally captured during vesicle formation. this property  has been exploited as a method to derive immunogenic vesicle preparations for use as vaccines. in this work, we constructed a salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strain that synthesized a derivative of the pneumococcal protein pspa engineered to be secreted into the periplasmic space. vesicles isolated from this strain contained pspa in the lumen. mice intranasally immunized with the vesicle  preparation developed serum antibody responses against vesicle components that included pspa and salmonella-derived lipopolysaccharide and outer membrane proteins, while no detectable responses developed in mice immunized with an equivalent dose of purified pspa. mucosal iga responses developed against the salmonella components, while the response to pspa was less apparent in most mice. mice immunized with the vesicle preparation were completely protected against a 10x 50% lethal dose (ld(5)(0)) challenge of streptococcus pneumoniae and significantly protected against a 200x ld(5)(0) challenge, while control mice immunized with purified pspa or empty vesicles were not protected. these results  establish that vesicles can be used to mucosally deliver an antigen from a gram-positive organism and induce a protective immune response.

AB  == we hypothesized that the immunogenicity of live salmonella enterica serovar typhi vaccines expressing heterologous antigens depends, at least in part, on its rpos  status. as part of our project to develop a recombinant attenuated s. typhi vaccine (rastyv) to prevent pneumococcal diseases in infants and children, we constructed three rastyv strains synthesizing the streptococcus pneumoniae surface protein pspa to test this hypothesis. each vector strain carried ten engineered mutations designed to optimize safety and immunogenicity. two s. typhi vector strains (chi9639 and chi9640) were derived from the rpos mutant strain ty2 and one (chi9633) from the rpos(+) strain isp1820. in chi9640, the nonfunctional  rpos gene was replaced with the functional rpos gene from isp1820. plasmid pya4088, encoding a secreted form of pspa, was moved into the three vector strains. the resulting rastyv strains were evaluated for safety in vitro and for  immunogenicity in mice. all three rastyv strains were similar to the live attenuated typhoid vaccine ty21a in their ability to survive in human blood and human monocytes. they were more sensitive to complement and were less able to survive and persist in sewage and surface water than their wild-type counterparts. adult mice intranasally immunized with any of the rastyv strains developed immune responses against pspa and salmonella antigens. the rpos(+) vaccines induced a balanced th1/th2 immune response while the rpos(-) strain chi9639(pya4088) induced a strong th2 immune response. immunization with any rastyv provided protection against s. pneumoniae challenge; the rpos(+) strain chi9640(pya4088) provided significantly greater protection than the isp1820 derivative, chi9633(pya4088). in the pre-clinical setting, these strains exhibited a desirable balance between safety and immunogenicity and are currently being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial to determine which of the three rastyvs has the optimal safety and immunogenicity profile in human hosts.

TI  == enhanced protection against nasopharyngeal carriage of streptococcus pneumoniae elicited by oral multiantigen dna vaccines delivered in attenuated salmonella typhimurium.
AB  == developing carrier systems and choosing appropriate antigens are essential steps  in improving the safety and efficacy of streptococcus pneumoniae dna vaccines, which have enhanced the mucosal protection against nasopharyngeal colonization. in this study, we reconstructed a salmonella-based balanced-lethal host-eukaryotic vector system, which was used as carrier to orally deliver the streptococcus pneumoniae multiantigen dna vaccines encoding psaa (pneumococcal surface adhesion a) and pspa' (n-terminal of pneumococcal surface protein a) genes. the results showed that the multiantigen dna vaccines using the new vector system as carrier afforded better protection than the vaccination with injected intramuscularly (i.m.) against streptococcus pneumoniae d39 colonization infection in balb/c mice models. this finding has associated with a high level of siga in the nasal mucosa as well as systemic igg antibodies and a shift toward a  th1-mediated immune response. these studies have demonstrated the feasibility and advantage of using the new salmonella-based balanced-lethal host-eukaryotic vector system as carrier to deliver s. pneumoniae dna vaccines.

TI  == community-acquired bloodstream infections in africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
AB  == data on the prevalence and causes of community-acquired bloodstream infections in africa are scarce. we searched three databases for studies that prospectively studied patients admitted to hospital with at least a blood culture, and found 22 eligible studies describing 58 296 patients, of whom 2051 (13.5%) of 15 166 adults and 3527 (8.2%) of 43 130 children had bloodstream infections. 1643 (29.1%) non-malaria bloodstream infections were due to salmonella enterica (58.4% of these non-typhoidal salmonella), the most prevalent isolate overall and in adults, and 1031 (18.3% overall) were due to streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common isolate in children. other common isolates included staphylococcus aureus  (531 infections; 9.5%) and escherichia coli (412; 7.3%). mycobacterium tuberculosis complex accounted for 166 (30.7%) of 539 isolates in seven studies that used mycobacterial culture techniques. hiv infection was associated with any bloodstream infection, particularly with s enterica and m tuberculosis complex bacteraemia. where recorded, patients with bloodstream infections had an in-hospital case fatality of 18.1%. our results show that bloodstream infections  are common and associated with high mortality. improved clinical microbiology services and reassessment of empirical treatment guidelines that account for the  epidemiology of bloodstream infections might contribute to better outcomes.

TI  == immunomodulatory activity of lactobacillus rhamnosus strains isolated from goat milk: impact on intestinal and respiratory infections.
AB  == the immune stimulation induced by lactobacillus rhamnosus crl1505 (lr05) and l. rhamnosus crl1506 (lr06) on the resistance to infection with an intestinal pathogen (salmonella typhimurium) and a respiratory pathogen (streptococcus pneumoniae) was studied in swiss-albine mice experimental models. the cytokine profiles that induced the innate and specific immune response in both infectious  processes were investigated. both strains were able to improve resistance against the intestinal pathogen. only lr05 was able to induce a significant decrease in the number of s. pneumoniae in the lung, prevent its dissemination into the blood and induce a significant increase in th1 (inf-gamma) and th2 (il-6, il-4 and il-10) cytokine levels in the bronchoalveolar lavages (bal). the changes in the cytokines profiles in bal were associated with an increase in the number and activity of phagocytic cells and with the increase in specific antibodies in serum and bal, which would explain the increased resistance to the challenge. the administration of lr06 did not induce significant effects at the respiratory mucosal level. the results described in the present paper showed that certain lab strains can share certain functional properties, although some of them can perform a functional role better than others, so that it is important to perform  careful studies on specific strains, according to their therapeutic use.

TI  == immunogenicity of a live recombinant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium vaccine expressing pspa in neonates and infant mice born from naive and immunized mothers.
AB  == we are developing a salmonella vectored vaccine to prevent infant pneumonia and other diseases caused by streptococcus pneumoniae. one prerequisite for achieving this goal is to construct and evaluate new recombinant attenuated salmonella vaccine (rasv) strains suitable for use in neonates and infants. salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strain chi9558(pya4088) specifies delivery of the pneumococcal protective antigen pspa and can protect adult mice from challenge with s. pneumoniae. this strain is completely safe for oral delivery to day-old and infant mice. here we assess the colonizing ability, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of chi9558(pya4088) in neonatal mice. colonization was assessed in mice 0, 2, 4, or 7 days of age after oral inoculation. in the presence of maternal antibodies, the colonization of lymphoid tissues was delayed, but the immune responses were enhanced in mice born to immunized mothers. both oral and intranasal routes were used to assess immunogenicity. all  orally or intranasally immunized neonatal and infant mice born to either immunized or naive mothers developed pspa-specific mucosal and systemic immune responses. mice born to immunized mothers produced higher titers of pspa-specific antibodies in the blood and mucosa and greater numbers of pspa-specific interleukin-4 (il-4)-secreting cells than mice born to naive mothers. more importantly, mice born to immune mothers showed a significant increase in protection against s. pneumoniae challenge. these results suggest that strain chi9558(pya4088) can circumvent some of the limitations of the immature immune system in neonatal and infant mice, generating enhanced protective immune responses in the presence of maternal antibodies.

TI  == biochemical characterization of the rnase ii family of exoribonucleases from the  human pathogens salmonella typhimurium and streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == maturation, turnover, and quality control of rna are performed by many different  classes of ribonucleases. escherichia coli rnase ii is the prototype of the rnase ii family of ribonucleases, a ubiquitous family of hydrolytic, processive 3' -->  5' exonucleases crucial in rna metabolism. rnase r is a member of this family that is modulated in response to stress and has been implicated in virulence. in  this work, rnase ii-like proteins were characterized in the human pathogens salmonella typhimurium and streptococcus pneumoniae. by sequence analysis, only one member of the rnase ii family was identified in s. pneumoniae, while both rnase ii and rnase r were found in sa. typhimurium. these enzymes were cloned, expressed, purified, and characterized with regard to their biochemical features  and modular architecture. the specificity of substrates and the final products generated by the enzymes were clearly demonstrated. sa. typhimurium rnase ii and  rnase r behaved essentially as their respective e. coli counterparts. we have shown that the only hydrolytic rnase found in s. pneumoniae was able to degrade structured rnas as is the case with e. coli rnase r. our results further showed that there are differences with regard to the activity and ability to bind rna from enzymes belonging to two distinct pneumococcal strains, and this may be related to a single amino acid substitution in the catalytic domain. since ribonucleases have not been previously characterized in s. pneumoniae or sa. typhimurium, this work provides an important first step in the understanding of post-transcriptional control in these pathogens.

TI  == regulated delayed expression of rfah in an attenuated salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium vaccine enhances immunogenicity of outer membrane proteins and a heterologous antigen.
AB  == rfah is a transcriptional antiterminator that reduces the polarity of long operons encoding secreted and surface-associated cell components of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, including o antigen and lipopolysaccharide core sugars. a deltarfah mutant strain is attenuated in mice (50% lethal dose [ld(50)], >10(8) cfu). to examine the potential for using rfah in conjunction with other attenuating mutations, we designed a series of strains in which we replaced the native rfah promoter with the tightly regulated arabinose-dependent  arac p(bad) promoter so that rfah expression was dependent on exogenously supplied arabinose provided during in vitro growth. following colonization of host lymphoid tissues, where arabinose was not available, the p(bad) promoter was no longer active and rfah was not expressed. in the absence of rfah, o antigen and core sugars were not synthesized. we constructed three mutant strains that expressed different levels of rfah by altering the ribosome-binding sequence and  start codon. one mutation, deltap(rfah178), was introduced into the attenuated vaccine strain chi9241 (deltapaba deltapabb deltaasda) expressing the pneumococcal surface protein pspa from an asd(+) balanced-lethal plasmid. mice immunized with this strain and boosted 4 weeks later induced higher levels of serum immunoglobulin g specific for pspa and for outer membrane proteins from other enteric bacteria than either an isogenic deltarfah derivative or the isogenic rfah(+) parent. eight weeks after primary oral immunization, mice were challenged with 200 ld(50) of virulent streptococcus pneumoniae wu2. immunization with deltap(rfah178) mutant strains led to increased levels of protection compared to that of the parent chi9241 and of a deltarfah derivative of chi9241.

TI  == pspa family fusion proteins delivered by attenuated salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium extend and enhance protection against streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == pneumococcal surface protein a (pspa) is highly immunogenic and can induce a protective immune response against pneumococcal infection. pspa is divided into two major families based on serological variability: family 1 and family 2. to provide broad protection, pspa proteins from pneumococcal strains rx1 (family 1)  and ef5668 (family 2) were combined to form two pspa fusion proteins, pspa/rx1-ef5668 and pspa/ef5668-rx1. each protein was fused to a type ii secretion signal and delivered by a recombinant attenuated salmonella vaccine (rasv). both pspa/rx1-ef5668 and pspa/ef5668-rx1 were synthesized in the rasv and secreted into the periplasm and supernatant. the fusion proteins reacted strongly with both anti-pspa/rx1 and anti-pspa/ef5668 antisera. oral immunization of balb/c mice with rasv synthesizing either pspa fusion protein elicited serum immunoglobulin g (igg) and mucosal iga responses against both families of pspa. analysis of igg isotypes (igg2a and igg1) indicated a strong th1 bias to the immune responses to both proteins. sera from mice immunized with rasv synthesizing pspa/rx1-ef5668 bound to the surface and directed c3 complement deposition on representative strains from all five pspa clades. immunization with rasv synthesizing either protein protected mice against intraperitoneal challenge with streptococcus pneumoniae wu2 strain (family 1), intravenous challenge with s. pneumoniae 3jyp2670 strain (family 2), and intranasal challenge with s. pneumoniae a66.1 (family 1). the pspa/rx1-ef5668 protein elicited significantly greater protection than pspa/ef5668-rx1, pspa/rx1, or pspa/ef5668. these results  indicate an rasv synthesizing a pspa fusion protein representing both pspa families constitutes an effective antipneumococcal vaccine, extending and enhancing protection against multiple strains of s. pneumoniae.

TI  == comparative structural and molecular characterization of ribitol-5-phosphate-containing streptococcus oralis coaggregation receptor polysaccharides.
AB  == the antigenically related coaggregation receptor polysaccharides (rps) of streptococcus oralis strains c104 and sk144 mediate recognition of these bacteria by other members of the dental plaque biofilm community. in the present study, the structure of strain sk144 rps was established by high resolution nmr spectroscopy as [6galfbeta1-6galnacbeta1-3galalpha1-2ribitol-5-po(4)(-)-6galfbeta1-3galbeta1](n), thereby indicating that this polysaccharide and the previously characterized rps  of strain c104 are identical, except for the linkage between gal and ribitol-5-phosphate, which is alpha1-2 in strain sk144 versus alpha1-1 in strain  c104. studies to define the molecular basis of rps structure revealed comparable  genes for six putative transferases and a polymerase in the rps loci of these streptococci. cell surface rps production was abolished by disrupting the gene for the first transferase of strain c104 with a nonpolar erm cassette. it was restored in the resulting mutant by plasmid-based expression of either wcjg, the  corresponding gene of s. pneumoniae for serotype 10a capsular polysaccharide (cps) biosynthesis or wbap for the transferase of salmonella enterica that initiates o-polysaccharide biosynthesis. thus, wcjg, like wbap, appears to initiate polysaccharide biosynthesis by transferring galactose-1-phosphate to a lipid carrier. in further studies, the structure of strain c104 rps was converted to that of strain sk144 by replacing the gene (wefm) for the fourth transferase in the rps locus of strain c104 with the corresponding gene (wcrc) of strain sk144 or streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 10a. these findings identify genetic markers for the different ribitol-5-phosphate-containing types of rps present in  s. oralis and establish a close relationship between these polysaccharides and serogroup 10 cpss of s. pneumoniae.

TI  == evaluation of new generation salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium vaccines with regulated delayed attenuation to induce immune responses against pspa.
AB  == increasing the immunogenicity to delivered antigens by recombinant attenuated salmonella vaccines (rasv) has been the subject of intensive study. with this goal in mind, we have designed and constructed a new generation of rasv that exhibit regulated delayed attenuation. these vaccine strains are phenotypically wild type at the time of immunization and become attenuated after colonization of host tissues. the vaccine strains are grown under conditions that allow expression of genes required for optimal invasion and colonization of host tissues. once established in the host, these virulence genes are turned off, fully attenuating the vaccine strain. in this study, we compared 2 of our newly developed regulated delayed attenuation salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strains chi9088 and chi9558 with the deltacya deltacrp deltaasd strain chi8133, for their abilities to express and present a secreted form of the alpha-helical region of pneumococcal surface protein a (pspa) to the mouse immune system. all 3 strains induced high levels of serum antibodies specific for pspa as well as to salmonella antigens in orally immunized mice. however, both rasvs expressing delayed attenuation elicited significantly greater anti-pspa immune responses, including serum igg and t cell secretion of il-4 and ifn-gamma, than other groups. also, vaccination with delayed attenuation strains resulted in a greater  degree of protection against streptococcus pneumoniae challenge than in mice vaccinated with chi8133 (71-86% vs. 21% survival, p </= 0.006). together, the results demonstrate that the regulated attenuation strategy results in highly immunogenic antigen delivery vectors for oral vaccination.

TI  == a sopb deletion mutation enhances the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a heterologous antigen delivered by live attenuated salmonella enterica vaccines.
AB  == sopb is a virulence factor of salmonella encoded by spi-5. salmonella sopb deletion mutants are impaired in their ability to cause local inflammatory responses and fluid secretion into the intestinal lumen and also can enhance the  immunogenicity of a vectored antigen. in this study, we evaluated the effects on  immunogenicity and the efficacy of a sopb deletion mutation on two salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium vaccine strains with different attenuating mutations expressing a highly antigenic alpha-helical region of the streptococcus pneumoniae surface protein pspa from an asd(+)-balanced lethal plasmid. after oral administration to mice, the two pairs of strains induced high levels of serum antibodies specific for pspa as well as to salmonella antigens. the levels  of antigen-specific serum immunoglobulin g (igg) and mucosal iga were higher in mice immunized with sopb mutants. enzyme-linked immunospot assay results indicated that the spleen cells from mice immunized with a sopb mutant showed higher interleukin-4 and gamma interferon secretion levels than did the mice immunized with the isogenic sopb(+) strain. the sopb mutants also induced higher  numbers of cd4(+) cd44(hi) cd62l(hi) and cd8(+) cd44(hi) cd62l(hi) central memory t cells. eight weeks after primary oral immunization, mice were challenged with 100 50% lethal doses of virulent s. pneumoniae wu2. immunization with either of the sopb mutant strains led to increased levels of protection compared to that with the isogenic sopb(+) parent. together, these results demonstrate that the deletion of sopb leads to an overall enhancement of the immunogenicity and efficacy of recombinant attenuated salmonella vaccine strains.

TI  == regulated programmed lysis of recombinant salmonella in host tissues to release protective antigens and confer biological containment.
AB  == we have devised and constructed a biological containment system designed to cause programmed bacterial cell lysis with no survivors. we have validated this system, using salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium vaccines for antigen delivery after colonization of host lymphoid tissues. the system is composed of two parts. the first component is salmonella typhimurium strain chi8937, with deletions of asda  and arabinose-regulated expression of mura, two genes required for peptidoglycan  synthesis and additional mutations to enhance complete lysis and antigen delivery. the second component is plasmid pya3681, which encodes arabinose-regulated mura and asda expression and c2-regulated synthesis of antisense asda and mura mrna transcribed from the p22 p(r) promoter. an arabinose-regulated c2 gene is present in the chromosome. chi8937(pya3681) exhibits arabinose-dependent growth. upon invasion of host tissues, an arabinose-free environment, transcription of asda, mura, and c2 ceases, and concentrations of their gene products decrease because of cell division. the drop in c2 concentration results in activation of p(r), driving synthesis of antisense mrna to block translation of any residual asda and mura mrna. a highly antigenic  alpha-helical domain of streptococcus pneumoniae rx1 pspa was cloned into pya3681, resulting in pya3685 to test antigen delivery. mice orally immunized with chi8937(pya3685) developed antibody responses to pspa and salmonella outer membrane proteins. no viable vaccine strain cells were detected in host tissues after 21 days. this system has potential applications with other gram-negative bacteria in which biological containment would be desirable.

TI  == analysis of type ii secretion of recombinant pneumococcal pspa and pspc in a salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium vaccine with regulated delayed antigen synthesis.
AB  == recombinant attenuated salmonella vaccines (rasvs) have been used extensively to  express and deliver heterologous antigens to host mucosal tissues. immune responses can be enhanced greatly when the antigen is secreted to the periplasm or extracellular compartment. the most common method for accomplishing this is by fusion of the antigen to a secretion signal sequence. finding an optimal signal sequence is typically done empirically. to facilitate this process, we constructed a series of plasmid expression vectors, each containing a different type ii signal sequence. we evaluated the utilities of these vectors by fusing two different antigens, the alpha-helix domains of pneumococcal surface protein a (pspa) and pneumococcal surface protein c (pspc), to the signal sequences of beta-lactamase (bla ss), ompa, and phoa and the signal sequence and c-terminal peptide of beta-lactamase (bla ss+ct) on asd(+) plasmids under the control of the p(trc) promoter. strains were characterized for level of expression, subcellular  antigen location, and the capacity to elicit antigen-specific immune responses and protection against challenge with streptococcus pneumoniae in mice. the immune responses to each protein differed depending on the signal sequence used.  strains carrying the bla ss-pspa and bla ss+ct-pspc fusions yielded the largest amounts of secreted pspa and pspc, respectively, and induced the highest serum igg titers, although all fusion proteins tested induced some level of antigen-specific igg response. consistent with the serum antibody responses, rasvs expressing the bla ss-pspa and bla ss+ct-pspc fusions induced the greatest  protection against s. pneumoniae challenge.

TI  == recombining population structure of plesiomonas shigelloides (enterobacteriaceae) revealed by multilocus sequence typing.
AB  == plesiomonas shigelloides is an emerging pathogen that is widespread in the aquatic environment and is responsible for intestinal diseases and extraintestinal infections in humans and other animals. virtually nothing is known about its genetic diversity, population structure, and evolution, which severely limits epidemiological control. we addressed these questions by developing a multilocus sequence typing (mlst) system based on five genes (fusa,  leus, pyrg, recg, and rpob) and analyzing 77 epidemiologically unrelated strains  from several countries and several ecological sources. the phylogenetic position  of p. shigelloides within family enterobacteriaceae was precisely defined by phylogenetic analysis of the same gene portions in other family members. within p. shigelloides, high levels of nucleotide diversity (average percentage of nucleotide differences between strains, 1.49%) and genotypic diversity (64 distinct sequence types; simpson's index, 99.7%) were found, with no salient internal phylogenetic structure. we estimated that homologous recombination in housekeeping genes affects p. shigelloides alleles and nucleotides 7 and 77 times more frequently than mutation, respectively. these ratios are similar to those observed in the naturally transformable species streptococcus pneumoniae with a high rate of recombination. in contrast, recombination within salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, and yersinia enterocolitica was much less frequent. p. shigelloides thus stands out among members of the enterobacteriaceae. its high rate of recombination results in a lack of association between genomic background and o and h antigenic factors, as observed for the 51 serotypes found in our sample. given its robustness and discriminatory power, we recommend mlst as a reference method for population biology studies and epidemiological tracking of p. shigelloides strains.

TI  == nmr assays for carbohydrate-based vaccines.
AB  == antibodies against the cell surface carbohydrates of many microbial pathogens protect against infection. this was initially exploited by the development of purified polysaccharide vaccines, but glycoconjugate vaccines, in which the cell  surface carbohydrate of a microbial pathogen is covalently attached to an appropriate carrier protein, are proving the most effective means to generate this protective immunity. carbohydrate-based vaccines against haemophilus influenzae type b, neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pneumoniae and salmonella enterica serotype typhi (s. typhi) are already licensed, and many similar products are in various stages of development. for many of these vaccines, biological assays are not available or are inappropriate and nmr spectroscopy is proving a valuable tool for the characterisation and quality control of existing and novel products. this review highlights some of the areas  in which nmr spectroscopy is currently used, and where further developments may be expected.

TI  == role of the acrab-tolc efflux pump in determining susceptibility of haemophilus influenzae to the novel peptide deformylase inhibitor lbm415.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae isolates vary widely in their susceptibilities to the peptide deformylase inhibitor lbm415 (mic range, 0.06 to 32 microg/ml); however,  on average, they are less susceptible than gram-positive organisms, such as staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. insertional inactivation of the h. influenzae acrb or tolc gene in strain nb65044 (rd strain kw20) increased  susceptibility to lbm415, confirming a role for the acrab-tolc pump in determining resistance. consistent with this, sequencing of a pcr fragment generated with primers flanking the acrra region from an lbm415-hypersusceptible  h. influenzae clinical isolate revealed a genetic deletion of acra. inactivation  of acrb or tolc in several clinical isolates with atypically reduced susceptibility to lbm415 (mic of 16 microg/ml or greater) significantly increased susceptibility, confirming that the pump is also a determinant of decreased susceptibility in these clinical isolates. examination of acrr, encoding the putative repressor of pump gene expression, from several of these strains revealed mutations introducing frameshifts, stop codons, and amino acid changes relative to the published sequence, suggesting that loss of pump repression leads to decreased susceptibility. supporting this, nb65044 acrr mutants selected by exposure to lbm415 at 8 microg/ml had susceptibilities to lbm415 and other pump substrates comparable to the least sensitive clinical isolates and showed increased expression of pump genes.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of blood isolates from a teaching hospital in north india.
AB  == bloodstream infections are associated with significant patient morbidity and mortality worldwide. in this study, we examined antimicrobial susceptibility patterns by reviewing the data on 5,704 blood samples that were collected from patients with fever/sepsis admitted to government medical college and hospital, chandigarh, india, over a period of 1 year from august 2003 to july 2004. among the 567 qualifying samples, pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.75%), escherichia coli (15.17%), klebsiella pneumoniae (14.99%), and salmonella enterica serovar typhi (12.87%) were the most frequently isolated gram-negative bacteria other than citrobacter, acinetobacter, proteus, and enterobacter spp. collectively accounting for 80.96% of the isolates. staphylococus aureus (13.86%) and enterococcus feacalis (2.35%) were most frequently isolated gram-positive bacteria other than other streptococcus and staphylococcus spp. collectively accounting for 18% of the isolates. among the antibiotics used for susceptibility testing of gram-negative isolates, amikacin showed higher activity (76.61%) against enterobacteriaceae and ciprofloxacin (65.17%) against non-fermenters. however, cefoperazone + sulbactum showed the highest activity (82.66%) among all  gram-negative isolates. for gram-positive isolates, vancomycin (100%), ciprofloxacin (89.74%) showed the highest activity against staphylococcus spp. combinations of antibiotics are often prescribed as emperic therapy for bacteremia, especially for gram-negative pathogens. hence the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of blood isolates reported here may be a useful guide for physicians initiating emperic therapy with antibiotics.

TI  == host-pathogen interactions: a proteomic view.
AB  == host-pathogen interactions reflect the balance of host defenses and pathogen virulence mechanisms. advances in proteomic technologies now afford opportunities to compare protein content between complex biologic systems ranging from cells to animals and clinical samples. thus, it is now possible to characterize host-pathogen interactions from a global proteomic view. most reports to date focus on cataloging protein content of pathogens and identifying virulence-associated proteins or proteomic alterations in host response. a more in-depth understanding of host-pathogen interactions has the potential to improve our mechanistic understanding of pathogenicity and virulence, thereby defining novel therapeutic and vaccine targets. in addition, proteomic characterization of the host response can provide pathogen-specific host biomarkers for rapid pathogen detection and characterization, as well as for early and specific detection of infectious diseases. a review of host-pathogen interactions focusing on proteomic analyses of both pathogen and host will be presented. relevant genomic studies and host model systems will be also be discussed.

AB  == the gene wcha (cap8e) belongs to the cps8 locus that is involved in biosynthesis  of the capsular polysaccharide (cps) repeat unit (ru) of the virulent streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 8. we report here the biochemical characterization of the membrane-associated protein wcha (cap8e), overexpressed in escherichia coli bl21(de3)/plyss. our results demonstrate that the recombinant enzyme transfers in vitro a glucosyl-1-phosphate from udp-glucose to an endogenous phosphoryl-polyprenol, thereby priming the ru biosynthetic pathway of  s. pneumoniae cps 8. we also show that the c-terminal half of wcha is the glycosyltransferase domain as observed for the galactosyl-1-phosphate transferase wbap from salmonella enterica, previously described to prime the first step of o-antigen biosynthesis. these results demonstrate that wcha plays a prominent function in the capsule biosynthesis and explain the key role it occupies in the  pneumococcal capsule variation.

TI  == the etiology of febrile illness in adults presenting to patan hospital in kathmandu, nepal.
AB  == in nepal, many infections remain poorly characterized, partly due to limited diagnostic facilities. we studied consecutive febrile adults presenting to a general hospital in kathmandu, nepal. of the 876 patients enrolled, enteric fever and pneumonia were the most common clinical diagnoses. putative pathogens were identified in 323 (37%) patients, the most common being salmonella enterica serotype typhi and s. enterica serotype paratyphi a (117), rickettsia typhi (97), streptococcus pneumoniae (53), leptospira spp. (36), and orientia tsutsugamushi (28). approximately half of the salmonella isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid. no clinical predictors were identified to reliably distinguish between the  different infections. these findings confirm the heavy burden of enteric fever and pneumonia in kathmandu, and highlight the importance of murine typhus, scrub  typhus, and leptospirosis. given the lack of reliable clinical predictors, the development of cheap and accurate diagnostic tests are likely to be of great clinical utility in this setting.

TI  == bacterial polysaccharides as vaccines--immunity and chemical characterization.
AB  == studies on protective immunity and biochemical characterization of bacterial capsular polysaccharides have led to significant contributions to understanding of the mechanisms of infectious diseases and development of effective vaccines. immunity to encapsulated bacteria is related to antibody response to polysaccharide (ps) antigen, interactions with t- and b-lymphocytes, and host defense mechanisms. meningococcal, pneumococcal and salmonella vi pss and haemophilus type b ps-protein conjugate vaccines have been licensed and provided  effective immunity for prevention of these bacterial infections. capsular pss are cell-surface polymers consisting of oligosaccharide repeating units. many pss are highly polar and hydrophilic and interfere with cell-to-cell interactions with phagocytes. most pneumococcal pss are negatively charged and possess acidic components such as d-glucuronic acid and phosphate in phosphodiester bonds. extensive immunologic cross-reactivity has been observed among bacterial capsular pss. in infants the antibody responses to most capsular pss are generally poor. enhanced immunogenicity of ps antigens can be achieved through ps-protein conjugate vaccines, immunization during a critical period of perinatal development and effective antigen delivery system.

TI  == the role of mutators in the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == bacteria contain a number of error prevention and error correction systems that maintain genome stability. however, strains exhibiting elevated mutation frequencies have recently been reported amongst natural populations of pathogenic escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, neisseria meningitidis, helicobacter pylori and streptococcus pneumoniae. the majority of naturally occurring, strong mutators contain defects in the methyl-directed mismatch repair (mmr) system, with mutations in muts predominating. mmr-deficient strains possess superior genetic backgrounds for the selection of some antibiotic-resistance mutations since mutation frequencies up to 1000-fold higher than normal strains have been reported, and resistance levels achieved in mutators can be greater than those arising in non-mutator hosts. mmr is a major constraint to interspecies recombination events. removal of this barrier, as in the case of mmr defective mutators, also enhances the frequency of horizontal gene transfer, which is an important mechanism of acquired drug resistance in bacteria. permanent global mutator status is associated with loss of fitness as mutators accumulate deleterious mutations more frequently than non-mutators. fitness limitations of mutators may be overcome simply by the high bacterial cell densities that can be achieved during acute infection or by the adoption of transient mutator status. mutators are a risk factor during the treatment of bacterial infections as they appear to enhance the selection of mutants expressing high- and low-level antibiotic resistance and have the capacity to refine existing plasmid-located resistance determinants.

TI  == immune responses dependent on antigen location in recombinant attenuated salmonella typhimurium vaccines following oral immunization.
AB  == the subcellular location of a recombinant antigen in recombinant attenuated salmonella vaccines may influence immunogenicity dependent on exposure of the recombinant antigen to cells involved in systemic immune responses. it has been shown that a recombinant attenuated salmonella vaccine secreting the recombinant  streptococcus pneumoniae pspa (rpspa) antigen specified by pya3494 induced protective anti-rpspa-specific immune responses (kang et al. (2002) infect. immun. 70, 1739-1749). a recombinant plasmid pya3496 specifying a his(6)-tagged rpspa (his(6)-rpspa) protein (no apparent signal sequence) caused the rpspa antigen to localize to the cytoplasm of salmonella. salmonella vaccines carrying  pya3494 or pya3496 expressed similar amounts of rpspa. after a single oral immunization in balb/c mice with 10(9) colony-forming units (cfu) of the recombinant salmonella vaccines carrying pya3494 or pya3496, igg antibody responses were stimulated to both rpspa and salmonella lipopolysaccharide (lps) antigens. the anti-rpspa igg titer induced by salmonella carrying pya3494 (1.9 x  10(7)) was 10(4) times higher than induced by salmonella carrying pya3496 (<2.4 x 10(3)).

TI  == the world health organization's external quality assurance system proficiency testing program has improved the accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility testing and reporting among participating laboratories using nccls methods.
AB  == a total of 150 laboratories in 33 countries that followed the nccls testing procedures participated in the world health organization's external quality assurance system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eqas-ast) from january 1998 through march 2001. laboratories tested seven bacterial isolates for antimicrobial resistance and reported the results to the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) in atlanta, ga. the results were compared to the results generated at the cdc with the nccls broth microdilution and disk diffusion reference methods. although there were few testing errors with salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar enteritidis, drugs that are not appropriate for therapy of salmonella infections were tested and reported by 136  (91%) of 150 laboratories. in addition, 29 (20%) of 150 laboratories used the staphylococcus aureus breakpoints to report oxacillin results for staphylococcus  saprophyticus. for a vanb-containing enterococcus faecalis strain, 124 (83%) of 150 laboratories correctly reported vancomycin results that were +/-1 doubling dilution from the reference mic or +/-3 mm from the reference disk diffusion result. of the laboratories that tested streptococcus agalactiae by disk diffusion, 17% reported nonsusceptible results for penicillin in error. while 110 laboratories (73%) tested the s. pneumoniae challenge isolate against a fluoroquinolone, 83% tested it against ciprofloxacin, for which there are no nccls interpretive criteria. ten of 12 laboratories testing levofloxacin and 4 of 4 laboratories testing ofloxacin by an mic method correctly reported resistant results for the isolate. feedback letters sent to participating laboratories highlighted areas of susceptibility testing in individual laboratories that needed improvement. the positive impact of the feedback letters and the overall effectiveness of the eqas program were documented in repeat testing challenges with pneumococci and staphylococci. the 31 and 19% increases in the numbers of laboratories using appropriate testing methods for pneumococci and staphylococci, respectively, in 2000 versus 1998 indicate that laboratory performance is improving.

TI  == hydrogen peroxide-mediated killing of caenorhabditis elegans by streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == caenorhabditis elegans is currently introduced as a new, facile, and cheap model  organism to study the pathogenesis of gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas  aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. the mechanisms of killing involve either diffusible exotoxins or infection-like processes. recently, it was shown that also some gram-positive bacteria kill c. elegans, although the precise mechanisms of killing remained open. we examined c. elegans as a pathogenesis model for the gram-positive bacterium streptococcus pyogenes, a major human pathogen capable of causing a wide spectrum of diseases. we demonstrate that s. pyogenes kills c. elegans, both on solid and in liquid medium. unlike p. aeruginosa and s. enterica serovar typhimurium, the killing by s. pyogenes is solely mediated by hydrogen peroxide. killing required live streptococci; the killing capacity depends on the amount of hydrogen peroxide produced, and killing can be inhibited by catalase. major exotoxins of s. pyogenes are not involved in  the killing process as confirmed by using specific toxin inhibitors and knockout  mutants. moreover, no accumulation of s. pyogenes in c. elegans is observed, which excludes the involvement of infection-like processes. preliminary results show that s. pneumoniae can also kill c. elegans by hydrogen peroxide production. hydrogen peroxide-mediated killing might represent a common mechanism by which gram-positive, catalase-negative pathogens kill c. elegans.

TI  == biodegradable microparticles for the mucosal delivery of antibacterial and dietary antigens.
AB  == mucosal administration of antigen is known to be appropriate for vaccine purposes as well as tolerance induction. biodegradable poly(dl-lactide-co-glycolide) (plga) microparticles were used to deliver both antibacterial phosphorylcholine (pc) and dietary antigen beta lactoglobulin (blg) by mucosal route. in a first study, the protective immunity elicited by intragastric vaccination with pc encapsulated in microparticles was evaluated in a mouse model against intestinal  infection by salmonella typhimurium and pulmonary infection by streptococcus pneumoniae. a significant rise in anti-pc immunoglobulin a (iga) titers, as measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, was observed in the intestinal  secretions after oral immunization with pc-loaded microparticles compared with the titers of mice immunized with free pc-thyr or blank microparticles. this antibody response correlated with a highly significant resistance to oral challenge by s. typhimurium. iga in pulmonary secretion were not able to protect  against s. pneumoniae infection. balb/c mice were, therefore, immunized intranasally (i.n.). immunization was followed by a rise in anti-pc iga and igg titers in serum and in pulmonary secretions by both free and encapsulated pc-thyr. the survival rates were 91 and 76% in the two groups of mice, respectively. in a second study and in order to prevent allergy against milk by inducing oral tolerance, one of the major allergenic milk protein, blg was entrapped into microparticles. oral administration of microparticles containing blg reduced significantly (by 10000) the amount of protein necessary to decrease  both specific anti blg ige and dth response. these studies demonstrate the ability of microparticles to induce both mucosal immunity and oral tolerance.

TI  == immune responses to recombinant pneumococcal pspa antigen delivered by live attenuated salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium vaccine.
AB  == attenuated salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium expressing recombinant antigens from other pathogens elicits primarily a th1-type dominant immune response to both recombinant and salmonella antigens. the immunogenicity and appropriate subcellular location of the recombinant antigen in the salmonella vaccine strain may contribute to augmenting immune responses by facilitating adequate exposure of recombinant antigen to antigen-presenting cells for processing. to allow for secretion from gram-negative bacteria and overexpression of antigen, a dna fragment encoding a highly antigenic alpha-helical region of pspa (pneumococcal surface protein a) was subcloned downstream from the beta-lactamase signal sequence in the multicopy asd(+) pya3493 vector to create pya3494. pya3493 was derived from a class of asd(+) vectors with reduced expression of asd to minimize selective disadvantage and enhance immunization of  expressed recombinant antigens. the s. enterica serovar typhimurium vaccine strain was constructed by the introduction of deletion mutations delta crp-28 and delta asda16. approximately 50% of the recombinant pspa (rpspa) expressed in a salmonella strain harboring pya3494 was detected in the combined supernatant and  periplasmic fractions of broth-grown recombinant salmonella. after a single oral  immunization in balb/c mice with 10(9) cfu of the recombinant salmonella vaccine  strain carrying pya3494, immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody responses were stimulated to both the heterologous antigen rpspa and salmonella lipopolysaccharide (lps) and outer membrane proteins (omps). about half, and even more at later times after immunization, of the antibodies induced to rpspa were igg1 (indicating a th2-type response), whereas 60 to 70% of the antibodies to lps and 80 to 90% of those to omps were igg2a (indicating a th1-type response). a sublethal infection with streptococcus pneumoniae wu2 boosted pspa antibody levels and maintained igg2a/igg1 ratios similar to those seen before the challenge. oral immunization with salmonella-pspa vaccine protected 60% of immunized mice from death after intraperitoneal challenge with 50 times the 50% lethal dose of virulent s. pneumoniae wu2.

AB  == background and aims: the gastrointestinal microflora exerts a barrier effect against enteropathogens. the aim of this study was to examine if bifidobacteria,  a major species of the human colonic microflora, participates in the barrier effect by developing antimicrobial activity against enterovirulent bacteria. methods: antibacterial activity was examined in vitro against a wide range of gram negative and gram positive pathogens. inhibition of salmonella typhimurium sl1334 cell association and cell invasion was investigated in vitro using caco-2  cells. colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract in vivo by bifidobacteria was examined in axenic c3/he/oujco mice. antimicrobial activity was examined in vivo  in axenic c3/he/oujco mice infected by the lethal s typhimurium c5 strain. results: fourteen human bifidobacterium strains isolated from infant stools were  examined for antimicrobial activity. two strains (ca1 and f9) expressed antagonistic activity against pathogens in vitro, inhibited cell entry, and killed intracellular s typhimurium sl1344 in caco-2 cells. an antibacterial component(s) produced by ca1 and f9 was found to be a lipophilic molecule(s) with a molecular weight of less than 3500. in the axenic c3/he/oujco mice, ca1 and f9  strains colonised the intestinal tract and protected mice against s typhimurium c5 lethal infection. conclusion: several bifidobacterium strains from resident infant human gastrointestinal microflora exert antimicrobial activity, suggesting that they could participate in the "barrier effect" produced by the indigenous microflora.

TI  == human c-reactive protein is protective against fatal salmonella enterica serovar  typhimurium infection in transgenic mice.
AB  == c-reactive protein (crp) is an acute-phase protein with a well-known association  with infection and other inflammatory conditions. we have shown that expression of human crp by crp transgenic (crptg) mice is protective against lethal infection by streptococcus pneumoniae, an effect likely mediated by crp's ability to bind to this gram-positive pathogen. in the present study we tested whether crptg mice are resistant to infection with salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, a gram-negative pathogen that causes the murine equivalent of typhoid fever. crptg mice experimentally infected with a virulent typhimurium strain lived longer and had significantly lower mortality than their non-tg littermates. the greater resistance of crptg mice could be attributed to significantly increased early (0 to 4 h) blood clearance of salmonellae and significantly decreased numbers of bacteria in the liver and spleen on day 7 postinfection. in addition, 14 days after infection with an avirulent salmonella  strain, the serum titer of anti-salmonella immunoglobulin g antibodies was higher in crptg than non-tg mice. this study provides unequivocal evidence that crp plays an important role in vivo in host defense against salmonellae during the early stages of infection. in addition, as the beneficial effect of crp includes  enhancement of the host's humoral immune response, crp may also contribute indirectly to host defense during later stages of infection.

TI  == polyosides (encapsulated bacteria).
AB  == the polysaccharide capsule which surrounds bacterial species such as haemophilus  influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis and salmonella typhi is a potent virulence factor by protecting the bacteria from phagocytosis. the host responds with antibody production and specific antibodies plus complement binding to the capsule facilitate opsonization of the micro-organism, which is phagocytized and eliminated. purified capsular polysaccharides elicit t-independent antibody responses without a memory function, but are often poorly  immunogenic in infants where much of the invasive h. influenzae type b (hib) and  pneumococcal infections is seen. therefore purified polysaccharides have found limited use as vaccines. however, covalent linkage of the capsular polysaccharide, or fractions thereof, to immunogenic carrier proteins creates glycoconjugates which are t-dependent antigens and which elicit antibodies also in infants and which prime for boosting either with the glycoconjugate or the capsular polysaccharide. in the last decade hib glycoconjugate vaccines have been successfully introduced and in countries with very high immunization coverage the disease has been virtually eliminated and a decline of over 95% has been seen in  countries with slightly lower vaccine rates. world-wide use of hib glycoconjugate vaccines offers the possibility of elimination of invasive hib disease. pneumococcal (11 serotypes with coverage of approximately 85% of invasive disease), meningococcal (a, c, w 135, y but not b) and s. typhi glycoconjugates are in advanced development and offer the prospect of being as successful as the  hib glycoconjugates.

AB  == owing partly to a lack of disease burden data, eastern and central european countries have not introduced universal infant immunization against haemophilus influenzae type b. to determine the incidence of haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis among children less than 5 years of age, data were examined from eight districts in slovakia that formed part of a national haemophilus influenzae type  b surveillance system. all invasive isolates of haemophilus influenzae type b identified from these districts during 24 months (1996-1997) were sent to a single central laboratory for serotype confirmation. thirty-five cases of confirmed haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis were identified, for a disease incidence among children under 5 years of 17.3 per 100,000 population per year. only 13 cases were identified during 1996, the first full year of the surveillance system. records were available for review at six of the eight district laboratories and showed that, using world health organization definitions, almost half of the cases of probable bacterial meningitis were culture negative, suggesting that the true incidence of haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis may be considerably higher than 17.3. the rate of haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis among children less than 5 years of age in slovakia  is comparable to that found in western europe and north america during the prevaccine era. thus, universal, publicly funded infant vaccination in slovakia can be expected to have the same dramatic effect on haemophilus influenzae type b disease morbidity and mortality as has been demonstrated in other countries that  have adopted this approach.

TI  == community-acquired septicaemia in southern viet nam: the importance of multidrug-resistant salmonella typhi.
AB  == in a prospective study conducted between mid 1993 and 1994, 437 adults and children were admitted with community-acquired septicaemia to an infectious diseases hospital in southern viet nam. gram-negative aerobes accounted for 90% of isolates and were predominantly salmonella typhi (67%), sal. para-typhi a (3%), escherichia coli (10%), and klebsiella spp. (5%). other salmonella spp. (1%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1%), neisseria meningitidis (0.5%) and haemophilus  influenzae (0.2%) were uncommon. staphylococcus aureus (5.5%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (2%) were the most common gram-positive isolates. patients with enteric fever were younger (median age 16 years, range 1-63) than the other patients (median age 43 years, range 1-88) (p < 0.001) and had a lower mortality  rate (0.3% vs. 23%; relative risk 69.5, 95% confidence interval 9.5-507.8; p < 0.0001). over 70% of the sal. typhi isolated were multi-drug-resistant, and 4% were resistant to nalidixic acid. multidrug-resistant sal. typhi is a major cause of community-acquired septicaemia in viet nam.

TI  == a live recombinant avirulent oral salmonella vaccine expressing pneumococcal surface protein a induces protective responses against streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == a live oral recombinant salmonella vaccine strain expressing pneumococcal surface protein a (pspa) was developed. the strain was attenuated with deltacya deltacrp  mutations. stable expression of pspa was achieved by the use of the balanced-lethal vector-host system, which employs an asd deletion in the host chromosome to impose an obligate requirement for diaminopimelic acid. the chromosomal deltaasd mutation was complemented by a plasmid vector possessing the asd+ gene. a portion of the pspa gene from streptococcus pneumoniae rx1 was cloned onto a multicopy asd+ vector. after oral immunization, the recombinant salmonella-pspa vaccine strain colonized the peyer's patches, spleens, and livers of balb/cbyj and cba/n mice and stimulated humoral and mucosal antibody responses. oral immunization of outbred new zealand white rabbits with the recombinant salmonella strain induced significant anti-pspa immunoglobulin g titers in serum and vaginal secretions. polyclonal sera from orally immunized mice detected pspa on the s. pneumoniae cell surface as revealed by immunofluorescence. oral immunization of balb/cj mice with the pspa-producing salmonella strain elicited antibody to pspa and resistance to challenge by the mouse-virulent human clinical isolate s. pneumoniae wu2. immune sera from orally  immunized mice conferred passive protection against otherwise lethal intraperitoneal or intravascular challenge with strain wu2.

TI  == protective immunity against salmonella typhimurium elicited in mice by oral vaccination with phosphorylcholine encapsulated in poly(dl-lactide-co-glycolide)  microspheres.
AB  == encapsulation of vaccines in biodegradable microspheres provides excellent mucosal immunogens with a high potential for immunization against bacterial infections. we tested the protective immunity elicited by intragastric vaccination with phosphorylcholine (pc) encapsulated in poly(dl-lactide-co-glycolide) (dl-plg) microspheres against salmonella typhimurium in a mouse model of invasive intestinal infection. we chose pc as the antigen because it was found to elicit an immune response after intestinal exposure of mice to pc-bearing s. typhimurium and because anti-pc immunity protects mice against streptococcus pneumoniae, another pc-bearing microorganism. mice were primed intragastrically on days 1, 2, and 3 and boosted on days 28, 29, and 30 with pc (280 microg) coupled to porcine thyroglobulin (pc-thyr) encapsulated in dl-plg microspheres, free pc-thyr, or blank microspheres. a significant rise in anti-pc immunoglobulin a (iga) titers, as measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, was observed in the intestinal secretions after immunization with pc-loaded microspheres, compared to the titers of mice immunized with free pc-thyr or blank microspheres. this antibody response peaked  14 days after the last boost and correlated with a highly significant resistance  to oral challenge by s. typhimurium c5 (p < 10(-3)). control mice were primed intraperitoneally on day 1 with 15 microg of pc in complete freund's adjuvant and boosted on days 10, 14, and 20 with the same dose without adjuvant but via the same route. in these mice, the levels of anti-pc iga in intestinal secretions were equivalent to those of the mice intragastrically immunized with pc-loaded microspheres, but protection was significantly weaker, suggesting that either the igas were not functional or that other immune mechanisms are important in protection. taken together, our results highlight the potential of antigen encapsulation in dl-plg microspheres for eliciting protective immunity against invasive intestinal bacterial diseases and suggest that a similar strategy could  be used against diseases caused by other pc-bearing microorganisms.

TI  == a novel pathway for o-polysaccharide biosynthesis in salmonella enterica serovar  borreze.
AB  == the plasmid-encoded gene cluster for o:54 o-polysaccharide synthesis in salmonella enterica serovar borreze (rfbo:54) contains three genes that direct synthesis of a mannac homopolymer with alternating beta1,3 and beta1,4 linkages.  in escherichia coli k-12, rfbao:54 adds the first mannac residue to the rfe (udp-glcpnac::undecaprenylphosphate glcpnac-1-phosphate transferase)- modified lipopolysaccharide core. hydrophobic cluster analysis of rfbao:54 indicates this  protein belongs to the exou family of nonprocessive beta-glycosyltransferases. two putative catalytic residues and a potential substrate-binding motif were identified in rfbao:54. topological analysis of rfbbo:54 predicts four transmembrane domains and a large central cytoplasmic domain. the latter shares homology with a similar domain in the processive beta-glycosyltransferases cps3s  of streptococcus pneumoniae and hasa of streptococcus pyogenes. hydrophobic cluster analysis of rfbbo:54 and cps3s indicates both possess the structural features characteristic of the hasa family of processive beta-glycosyltransferases. four potential catalytic residues and a putative substrate-binding motif were identified in rfbbo:54. in deltarfb e. coli k-12, rfbao:54 and rfbbo:54 direct synthesis of smooth o:54 lipopolysaccharide, indicating that this o-polysaccharide involves a novel pathway for o-antigen transport. based on sequence and structural conservation, 15 new exou-related and 17 new hasa-related transferases were identified.

TI  == a human temporal bone study of acute bacterial meningogenic labyrinthitis.
AB  == it is well established that sensorineural hearing loss (snhl) is an important sequela of acute bacterial meningitis. previous human temporal bone histopathologic studies have suggested that such hearing loss is due to labyrinthitis. this study involved a detailed and systematic evaluation of the auditory and vestibular end-organs in 41 human temporal bones from patients with  acute bacterial meningitis, aimed at describing the spectrum of histopathologic changes within the labyrinth, ascertaining likely routes for spread of infection  from the meninges to the inner ear, and comparing the data from humans with those described in a rabbit model of meningogenic labyrinthitis. our study revealed the following: (a) suppurative labyrinthitis occurred in 20 (49%) bones. of these 20  bones, the cochlea was affected in all, whereas the vestibular organs were involved in 10. eosinophilic staining of inner ear fluids without the presence of inflammatory cells (so-called "serous" labyrinthitis) occurred in 14 of the remaining 21 bones. this staining occurred primarily within the vestibular system. its significance and pathogenesis remains unknown; (b) sensory and neural structures of the inner ear appeared intact in the majority of specimens, including bones with suppurative labyrinthitis and those with eosinophilic staining of inner ear fluids. this finding raises the possibility of preventing or reversing snhl by therapeutic intervention. spiral ganglion cells were severely degenerated in 12% of bones, indicating a retrocochlear site of hearing  loss in addition to the cochlea. this subset of patients may perform poorly after cochlear implantation; (c) it has been traditionally assumed that irreversible and permanent snhl is caused by suppurative labyrinthitis, whereas reversible snhl is caused by serous labyrinthitis. our findings question the validity of these assumptions; (d) the data were consistent with the hypothesis that both the cochlear modiolus and cochlear aqueduct can serve as potential pathways for spread of infection from the meninges to the inner ear; (e) there were many similarities in the histopathology of the inner ear in humans when compared with  the rabbit model of meningogenic labyrinthitis. a notable difference was that the cochlear aqueduct appeared to be the sole pathway for spread of infection in the  rabbit, whereas in the human, both the modiolus and aqueduct were possible pathways.

AB  == infected aortic aneurysms remain a difficult surgical problem associated with high morbidity and mortality. we report three cases of mycotic thoracoabdominal aneurysms treated by debridement of infected aortic tissue, in situ prosthetic graft replacement, and intensive antibiotic therapy. one early death occurred in  a patient with systemic sepsis related to salmonella enteritidis infection of the thoracic aorta secondary to a colovesical fistula. the two other patients remain  alive at 2 years without further complications of the surgery. bacteriology is as follows: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and salmonella enteritidis. in all patients the operation was performed immediately after the diagnosis was confirmed. antibiotic therapy was begun intraoperatively and was continued for at least 6 months. two patients were followed regularly, and there  have been no septic recurrences in our 2-year follow-up period. in situ prosthetic graft replacement in conjunction with intensive antibiotic therapy is  a viable option in the treatment of mycotic thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms.

TI  == altering the conserved nucleotide binding motif in the salmonella typhimurium muts mismatch repair protein affects both its atpase and mismatch binding activities.
AB  == the salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli muts protein is one of several methyl-directed mismatch repair proteins that act together to correct replication errors. muts is homologous to the streptococcus pneumoniae hexa mismatch repair protein and to the duc1 and rep1 proteins of human and mouse. homology between the deduced amino acid sequence of both muts and hexa, and the type a nucleotide  binding site consensus sequence, suggested that atp binding and hydrolysis play a role in their mismatch repair functions. we found that muts does indeed weakly hydrolyze atp to adp and pi, with a km of 6 microm and kcat of 0.26. to show that this activity is intrinsic to muts, we made a site-directed mutation, which resulted in the invariant lysine of the nucleotide binding consensus sequence being changed to an alanine. the mutant muts allele was unable to complement a muts::tn10 mutation in vivo, and was dominant over wild type when present in high copy number. the purified mutant protein had reduced atpase activity, with the km affected more severely than the kcat. like the wild type muts protein, the mutant protein is able to bind heteroduplex dna specifically, but the mutant protein does so with a reduced affinity.

AB  == thiol broth is known to neutralize various antimicrobial agents. positivity of growth of various species of bacteria from blood in thiol broth was reported as similar to that in tryptic soy broth (tsb). as blood cultures are often used for  the diagnosis of typhoid fever, and as patients may receive antimicrobial therapy before blood culture, the positivity and rapidity of growth of salmonella typhi in thiol broth were compared to those in tsb. routine blood culture samples from  yonsei medical center patients were inoculated in 50-ml amounts of tsb and thiol  broth. the media were prepared from dehydrated products and did not contain co2,  but tsb contained 0.025% sodium polyanethol sulfonate (sps). growth of s. paratyphi-a, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., serratia marcescens and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus were similar in both media. however, greater positivity and shorter incubation time for macroscopic detection were noted in tsb with s. typhi, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. it is concluded that thiol broth is inferior to tsb plus sps for the culture of s. typhi from blood.

TI  == nucleotide sequence of the streptococcus pneumoniae hexb mismatch repair gene: homology of hexb to mutl of salmonella typhimurium and to pms1 of saccharomyces cerevisiae.
AB  == the hex mismatch repair system of streptococcus pneumoniae acts both during transformation (a recombination process that directly produces heteroduplex dna)  to correct donor strands and after dna replication to remove misincorporated nucleotides. the hexb gene product is one of at least two proteins required for mismatch repair in this organism. the nucleotide sequence of a 2.7-kilobase segment from the s. pneumoniae chromosome that includes the 1.95-kilobase hexb gene was determined. the gene encodes a 73.5-kilodalton protein (649 residues). the spontaneous hex rx chromosomal mutant allele with which a mutator phenotype has been associated is shown to result from a single base substitution (tac to taa) leading to a truncated hexb polypeptide (484 residues). the hexb protein is  homologous to the mutl protein, which is required for methyl-directed mismatch repair in salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli, and to the pms1 gene product, which is likely to be involved in a mismatch correction system in saccharomyces cerevisiae. the conservation of hexb-like proteins among procaryotic and eucaryotic organisms indicates that these proteins play an important common role in the repair process. this finding also suggests that the  hex, mut, and pms systems evolved from a common ancestor and that functionally similar mismatch repair systems could be widespread among procaryotic as well as  eucaryotic organisms.

TI  == effect of various adjuvants on the antibody response of mice to pneumococcal polysaccharides.
AB  == adjuvant effects on the serum antibody response to pneumococcal polysaccharide (pps) types 3 and 14 were studied in balb/c mice. first, dose responses were established for the two pps types and were found to be entirely different. high (5 micrograms) and low (0.005 microgram) doses of pps 3 induced antigen-specific  unresponsiveness and suppression, while 0.1 microgram induced an optimal response. the secondary response to a single dose of killed pneumococci or 0.1 microgram of pps 3 injected 2 weeks later was not higher than the primary response. nu/nu, athymic balb/c mice showed high but not low dose tolerance to pps 3. in contrast, no convincing evidence for high dose tolerance to pps 14 was  obtained: 25 micrograms of pps 14 induced an optimal response, whereas 0.2-0.5 microgram induced antigen-specific suppression. secondary anti-pps 14 igm and igg responses, even after optimal primary doses, were only slightly higher than primary responses to a single dose of killed bacteria. athymic balb/c mice showed lower igg antibody responses than euthymic mice to pps 14. injection of detoxified endotoxin (d-lps) 2-4 days after antigen enhanced both primary and secondary responses and reversed high dose tolerance induction. injection of d-lps also at least partially prevented the induction of low dose tolerance as did injection of interleukin-1, but normuramyl dipeptide (nor-mdp) failed to affect the responses to pps 3 and 14. coupling of muramyl tripeptide to pps 3 rendered the pps more immunogenic. administration of emulsified pps in squalene arlacel, particularly with nor-mdp incorporated in the mixture, appeared to induce a better 7s antibody response than did pps in saline, but these serum antibody levels were not sustained at a high level. pretreatment with igd or simultaneous injection of igd with pps 14 enhanced both primary and secondary responses. the response to pps 3 was only slightly enhanced and low dose tolerance was not prevented by pretreatment with igd.

AB  == the muts gene product of escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium is one of at least four proteins required for methyl-directed mismatch repair in these organisms. a functionally similar repair system in streptococcus pneumoniae requires the hex genes. we have sequenced the s. typhimurium muts gene, showing that it encodes a 96-kilodalton protein. amino-terminal amino acid sequencing of  purified s. typhimurium muts protein confirmed the initial portion of the deduced amino acid sequence. the s. typhimurium muts protein is homologous to the s. pneumoniae hexa protein, suggesting that they arose from a common ancestor before the gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria diverged. overall, approximately 36% of the amino acids of the two proteins are identical when the sequences are optimally aligned, including regions of stronger homology which are of particular interest. one such region is close to the amino terminus. another, located closer to the carboxy terminus, includes homology to a consensus sequence thought to be  diagnostic of nucleotide-binding sites. a third one, adjacent to the second, is homologous to the consensus sequence for the helix-turn-helix motif found in many dna-binding proteins. we found that the s. typhimurium muts protein can substitute for the e. coli muts protein in vitro as it can in vivo, but we have not yet been able to demonstrate a similar in vitro complementation by the s. pneumoniae hexa protein.

AB  == the hex system of heteroduplex dna base mismatch repair operates in streptococcus pneumoniae after transformation and replication to correct donor and nascent dna  strands, respectively. a functionally similar system, called mut, operates in escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. the nucleotide sequence of a 3.8-kilobase segment from the s. pneumoniae chromosome that includes the 2.7-kilobase hexa gene was determined. an open reading frame that could encode a  17-kilodalton polypeptide (orfc) was located just upstream of the gene encoding a polypeptide of 95 kilodaltons corresponding to hexa. shine-dalgarno sequences and putative promoters were identified upstream of each protein start site. insertion mutations showed that only hexa functioned in mismatch repair and that the promoter for hexa transcription was located within the orfc-coding region. the hexa polypeptide contains a consensus sequence for atp- or gtp-binding sites in proteins. comparison of the entire hexa protein sequence to that of muts of s. typhimurium, which was determined by haber et al. in the accompanying paper (l. t. haber, p. p. pang, d. i. sobell, j. a. mankovitch, and g. c. walker, j. bacteriol. 170:197-202, 1988), showed the proteins to be homologous, inasmuch as  36% of their amino acid residues were identical. this homology indicates that the hex and mut systems of mismatch repair evolved from an ancestor common to the gram-positive streptococci and the gram-negative enterobacteria. it is the first  direct evidence linking the two systems.

AB  == s. pneumoniae, s. zooepidemicus, salmonella spp., b. bronchiseptica and sendai virus were examined in a total of 45 guinea pig colonies (17 institutional and 28 breeder's colonies) of hartley strain, and found to be positive in 6, 3, 5, 20 and 14 colonies, respectively. sendai virus was highly prevalent among guinea pigs, showing so high rates positive as 80 to 100% of animals obtained from 11 of the 14 contaminated colonies. b. bronchiseptica was also shown to be prevalent within contaminated colonies by indication of rates positive more than 40% of animals examined in 14 of the 20 colonies. infection rates of other 3 pathogens,  however, ranged from lower than 20% to higher than 80% according to colonies. all strains of salmonella isolated in this survey were identified as s. typhimurium and those of s. pneumoniae as serotype 19f.

TI  == neutrophil bactericidal dysfunction towards oxidant radical-sensitive microorganisms during experimental iron deficiency.
AB  == we developed a clear-cut nutritional iron deficiency anemia without concomittant  malnutrition in rats given a low iron diet, and we restored normal iron and hemoglobin levels in these same animals with iron dextran injections. the neutrophil function studies performed during and after a period of iron deficiency showed the following: phagocytosis of staphylococcus aureus 502a, streptococcus pneumoniae, and salmonella typhimurium was not altered by iron deficiency or by the administration of iron; phagocytosis of candida albicans was moderately abnormal during iron deficiency, and became normal with the restoration of iron sufficiency. microbicidal activity towards staphylococcus aureus 502a and candida albicans, two catalase-positive microorganisms, was markedly decreased (to 50% of control values) and returned to normal when iron sufficiency was restored. killing of a catalase-negative organism, streptococcus  pneumoniae was normal in iron-deficient rats. this pattern of differential bactericidal activities suggested an abnormality of the oxidant radical-generating machinery in neutrophils of iron-deficient animals. indeed, iron deficiency caused a marked decrease of neutrophil nitroblue tetrazolium dye  reduction, which disappeared after iron administration. neutrophil myeloperoxidase activity was slightly decreased in iron deficient rats and returned to normal after iron administration. microbicidal activity towards a gram-negative, catalase-positive organism, salmonella typhimurium, was equal in iron deficient and iron sufficient animals. our combined results suggest that a definite microbicidal defect is the consequence of nutritional iron deficiency, apart from any protein-calorie malnutrition. this defect affects the disposal in  pmns of two catalase-positive microorganisms (which require intracellular production of oxidant radicals for their destruction) but not of a catalase-negative bacterial species.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == bacteremia in hospitalized black south african children. a one-year study emphasizing nosocomial bacteremia and bacteremia in severely malnourished children.
AB  == during a one-year period, 315 of 5,397 children admitted to the general pediatric wards of a hospital had bacteremia. the commonest causative organisms were streptococcus pneumoniae, salmonella enteritidis, hemophilus influenzae, and escherichia coli. most episodes of bacteremia were associated with gastroenteritis, pneumonia, or meningitis. seventy-eight episodes occurred in children with severe protein-energy malnutrition, and 46 episodes were hospital acquired. the overall case fatality rate was 23.2%, being highest in children with severe malnutrition and in those with other underlying conditions. the high  proportion of bacteremias due to s pneumoniae and s enteritidis possibly reflects infections occurring in a lower socioeconomic group living in a temperate climate in crowded conditions. the most appropriate antimicrobial therapy for children who have suspected bacteremia in association with gastroenteritis or severe malnutrition is a combination of ampicillin sodium and gentamicin sulfate.

TI  == mutagenicity and cytotoxicity of the carcinogen-mutagen aflatoxin b1 in streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) and salmonella typhimurium: dependence on dna repair functions.
AB  == strains r6, r6x and r6uvr-1 of streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) are sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of the mutagen/carcinogen aflatoxin b1 (afb1). r6uvr-1 is more prone to the cytotoxic effects of afb1 than the repair-proficient parental strain, r6. the same differential susceptibility of strains r6, r6x and  r6uvr-1 was observed when uv light replaced metabolically activated afb1. all pneumococcal strains were immutable by afb1. afb1 mutagenesis in salmonella typhimurium strains was dependent on a functional reca gene product. the enhancing effects of delta uvrb and plasmid pkm101 were found to be additive. data presented are consistent with the following: (i) afb1 toxic effects are due  mainly to dna binding of afb1; (ii) afb1 mutagenesis is dependent on error-prone  dna repair; (iii) pneumococcus lacks an active error-prone (sos) dna-repair system.

TI  == a genetic locus responsible for salmonella susceptibility in bsvs mice is not responsible for the limited t-dependent immune responsiveness of bsvs mice.
AB  == bsvs mice are known to be highly susceptible to salmonella infection. we have shown that the bulk of the difference in susceptibility between bsvs and salmonella-resistant a/j mice is the result of a genetic difference at a single locus not closely linked to h-2, igh-c, or hbb, and not x-linked. we have backcrossed the a/j allele at this locus into bsvs mice for 8 successive generations and have demonstrated that the salmonella resistance afforded by this allele is not the result of a restoration of the generalized poor t-dependent responsiveness of bsvs mice. the salmonella resistance locus we have examined with these 2 strains is probably the same as the ity locus described by others.

AB  == this study is a review of 1,040 significant positive blood cultures from 415 patients, and 44 positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures from 44 patients treated at the meir general hospital during the period 1976-78. the most frequent isolates from blood cultures were escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae. the most frequent isolates from cerebrospinal fluid cultures were streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and neisseria meningitidis, which were present in similar proportions. e. coli was predominant  in the division of medicine, staph. aureus in the division of pediatrics and klebsiella in the division of surgery. fifty percent of the e. coli isolates were sensitive to ampicillin and carbenicillin; about 80%, to cephalothin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim; and 100%, to gentamicin. only 7% of the klebsiella isolates were sensitive to apicillin; 72% were sensitive to cephalothin and 87%,  to gentamicin. only 18% of staph. aureus isolates were sensitive to penicillin, but about 95% were sensitive to methicillin or cephalothin. two of 10 salmonellae isolates and 13% of h. influenzae were resistant to ampicillin.

TI  == effects of infection and endotoxin on rat hepatic rna production and distribution.
AB  == rat liver was quantitatively subfractionated into free ribosomal, bound ribosomal, nuclear, and soluble fractions to determine the effects of infection and endotoxin treatment on hepatic rna production and distribution. a 4-h pulse label of [14c]orotic acid was used to monitor newly transcribed rna; distribution was determined by measuring rna content at various times after infection or endotoxin treatment. a significant increase in the rate of rna synthesis was seen by 12 h and continued through 20 h in response to streptococcus pneumoniae infection. during the peak hours of the rna response, redistribution of rna into  the bound ribosomal fraction takes place at the expense of the free ribosomes. however, in salmonella typhimurium and its endotoxin, more involvement of the free ribosoma fraction during the early stages of the infection was apparent. these data suggest that the hepatic rna response takes place in two stages, an early "endotoxin" response, resulting in redistribution of cytoplasmic rna into free ribosomes, and a later "infection" response, involving the mobilization of the bound ribosomes.

AB  == the kinetics of inactivation and the resistance to gamma radiation of microorganisms usually to be found in raw sludge were examined with five viruses, three bacteria and a fungus serving as prototypes in comparative studies. all these infectious agents could reliably be inactivated by gamma rays in raw sewage sludge but they were clearly more resistant to gamma rays compared to irradiation in a liquid suspension. the reduction of the virus content required a much higher radiation dose compared to bacteria and the fungus used, excluding streptococcus  faecalis which was exceptionally resistant. considering the content of pathogenic viruses and other agents in raw sewage sludge, the required radiation dose necessary to comply with average to strict demands for the hygienisation of sewage sludge is discussed. the radiation dose of 500 to 1,000 krad seems therefore to be sufficient.

TI  == infections in sickle cell anemia: pathogenesis and control.
AB  == splenic dysfunction accounts for the greatest deficit in immune function in children with homozygous scd. this dysfunction, coupled with the natural immunologic immaturity of all young children subjects the young child with scd to an immense risk of severe pyogenic infections. to data, experience would suggest  that pneumococcal vaccines may provide only modest protection in the child with scd less than 5 years of age. antipneumococcal antibody responses are poor in children less than two years of age. all reported failures of pneumococcal vaccine among children with scd have occurred in children less than three years of age and offending pneumococci have been of groups 6 and 23. prophylactic antibiotic regimens have yet to be submitted to rigid scientific investigation and their utility in eliminating the risk of pneumococcal sepsis in asplenic hosts is unknown.

AB  == a plaque assay technique was used to assess the immunogenicity of a gonococcal cell wall polysaccharide (gc2 antigen) in balb/c mice. the gc2 antigen was shown  to be immunogenic, and the kinetics of the response differed from that of a pneumococcal polysaccharide (sss-iii) and a polysaccharide antigen of salmonella  typhosa (vi antigen). in addition, using antithymocyte sera, the t-lymphocyte dependency of these antigens was investigated. the immune response to the gc2 antigen was demonstrated to be dependent on a population of helper t cells, whereas the response to sss-iii appears to be regulated by suppressor t cells. there appears to be marked differences in the immune response of mice to different bacterial polysaccharides.

TI  == serum opsonic deficiency produced by streptococcus pneumoniae and by capsular polysaccharide antigens.
AB  == the opsonic requirements for phagocytosis of s. pneumoniae types 6, 7, 18, and 23 were determined in normal and c2 deficient serum, and in normal serum chelated with magnesium ethyleneglycoltetraacetic acid. all four strains were effectively  opsonized via the alternative complement pathway, a finding suggesting that the capsular polysaccharides of these strains activated complement via the alternative pathway. since bacteremic pneumococcal disease is often associated with circulating capsular polysaccharide, it was considered that this cellular component may activate complement in vivo and impair host defenses by producing an opsonic defect for pneumococci. to examine this hypothesis, serum was incubated with suspensions of whole s. pneumoniae types 6, 7, 18, or 23 or with purified capsular polysaccharide from each of these types, and residual complement activity and opsonic capacity were measured. hemolytic c 3--9 complement activity and opsonic capacity for 3h-thymidine labeled salmonella typhimurium, a species effectively opsonized via the alternative pathway, were reduced in serum following incubation. polysaccharide concentrations as low as 1  microgram/ml inhibited serum opsonic capacity for salmonella. whole pneumococci and pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide also inhibited the opsonic activity of human c2 deficient serum for salmonella, further evidence for activation of complement via the alternative pathway. pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide markedly inhibited the opsonic capacity of normal serum for the homologous pneumoccal type. thus, amounts of pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide, similar to those found in the serum of patients with pneumococcal disease, bring about decomplementation of serum via activation of the alternative pathway and inhibit  pneumococcal opsonization.

TI  == effects of surface-active agents on neutrophil receptors.
AB  == an easily performed assay to identify the c3b and fc receptors on human neutrophils was developed. salmonella typhimurium were treated with fluorescein and then incubated in nonimmune fresh human serum, which led to c3b fixation via  activation of the alternative pathway. similarly, type ii pneumococci were treated with fluorescein and opsonized with type-specific rabbit antiserum. neutrophils bearing c3b and fc receptors formed rosettes with the respective bacteria, which were easily readable because of their bright fluorescence. incubation of neutrophils at 37 degrees c with c3-coated bacteria generated 54 +/ 4% c3b rosettes, whereas neutrophils incubated with immunoglobulin g-coated bacteria yielded 75 +/ 7% rosettes. incubation at 4 degrees c inhibited the formation of c3b rosettes but not fc rosettes. heat inactivation of the fresh human serum at 56 degrees c for 30 min completely inhibited the formation of the  c3b rosettes, and addition of heat-aggregated immunoglobulin g to the polymorphonuclear leukocyte blocked the ability of the polymorphonuclear leukocyte to bind immunoglobulin g-coated bacteria. addition of 1.0 mm n-ethylmaleimide, 0.1 mg of trypsin per ml, 10 mm h2o2, o2- generated by xanthine-xanthine oxidase, and 8 times 10(-4) m hydrocortisone inhibited the c3b  receptor, but did not inhibit the fc receptor. in neutrophils, the selective effect of the various inhibitors suggests that the fc and c3b receptors are distinct entities.

AB  == the concentrations of cytoplasmic lactate and pyruvate and the nad+/nadh ratio and the concentrations of mitochondrial acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and the nad+/nadh ratio were determined in normal, fed, and fasted rats, and in rats  infected with streptococcus pneumoniae, francisella tularensis, and salmonella typhimurium. the various infections were found to have little or no effect on the cytoplasmic parameters. in normal rats, fasting caused a marked increase in blood and hepatic ketone concentration and in serum free fatty acid content. fasted infected rats, however, did not show the increase in ketone bodies or serum free  fatty acids normally associated with fasting alone. the mitochondrial nad+/nadh ratio increased as the infections progressed, reversing the normal trend. the introduction of an infection during the fasting state when ketone bodies and serum free fatty acids were elevated caused a marked depression in their concentration. these data have led to a postulation of decreased lipolysis in the infected host to account for the lowered hepatic and blood ketone bodies and the  decreased level of serum free fatty acids.

TI  == defective lipid disposal mechanisms during bacterial infection in rhesus monkeys.
AB  == mechanisms producing hypertriglyceridemia during bacterial sepsis have not been well defined. in this study lipid disposal mechanisms were assessed in 76 infected and 19 control male rhesus monkeys by the ability to dispose of triglycerides after: (1) oral lipid loading; (2) intravenous lipid loading; and (3) by lipolytic enzyme activity tests as measured by postheparin lipolytic activity (phla). studies were performed both before and 48 hr after intravenous inoculation with either salmonella typhimurium or diplococcus pneumoniae when illness was uniformly severe and fasting serum triglyceride elevations were increased maximally. s. typhimurium-infected monkeys demonstrated significant fasting hypertriglyceridemia (p is less than 0.001), reduced clearance of orally  and intravenously administered lipid and markedly reduced phla. during this gram-negative sepsis, mild lethargy, slight diarrhea, and a 2% mortality were observed. during d. pneumoniae sepsis, average fasting triglyceride concentrations were slightly, but not significantly elevated. while oral lipid clearance was impaired, intravenous lipid clearance was unimpaired, and phla was  slightly reduced. marked lethargy, agitation, and a 20% mortality were present during this gram-positive infection. results of this study support the concept that an impairment of lipid disposal mechanisms, particularly during gram-negative sepsis with s. typhimurium, may significantly contribute to the observed hypertriglyceridemia.

TI  == systematic difference in the methylation of ribosomal ribonucleic acid from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == a survey of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was performed to compare the distributionof n6-methylated adenine. it was found that (i) all the gram-positive strains tested, staphylococcus aureus, sarcina lutea, bacillus stearothermophilus, bacillus subtilis, and bacillus megaterium, contain neither n6-monomethyl adenine (m6a) nor n6-dimethyladenine (m26a) in 23s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rrna). in the case of s. aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, strains which are clinically resistant to erythromycin contain m26a. (ii) the gram-negative strains salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae all contain m6a but  not m23a in 23s rrna. these observations suggest the existence of at least one systematic structural difference between the ribosomes of the two classes of bacteria. because of the demonstrated relationship between n6-dimethylation of adenine in 23s rrna and clinical resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b-type antibiotics in staphylococci and streptococci, the observed  systematic differences found in rrna methylation combined with greater cellular permeability may be related to the relatively greater efficacy of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b-type antibiotics in treating infections caused by gram-positive organisms.

TI  == accelerated host metabolism of l-thyroxine during acute infection: role of the leukocyte and peripheral leukocytosis.
AB  == metabolism of thyroid hormones is accelerated during acute infection in man and in experimental animals. the pathogenetic mechanisms mediating this phenomenon are uncertain, but activated leukocytes of the infected host have been implicated as potentially important sites of hormone degradation. the present studies were conducted in an attempt to assess the in vivo contribution of leukocytes and peripheral leukocytosis to the enhancement of l-thyroxine (t4) clearance seen during infection, and to evaluate further the possible roles of fever and of changes in the extracellular binding of t4. in 10 rhesus monkeys inoculated with  virulent yellow fever (yf) virus, peripheral disposal of t4 was significantly accelerated (2-fold) during the febrile phase of the illness. this experimental viral infection was not accompanied by neutrophilic leukocytosis nor by detectable changes in serum free t4 levels, suggesting that neither an increased  circulating neutrophil mass nor diminished extracellular binding of t4 contributed appreciably to the increase in metabolism of t4. a pathogenetic role  for fever in the enhancement of t4 degradation was not specifically excluded in these infected monkeys. however, the failure of t4 turnover to increase during other febrile infections, such as that which followed inoculation of monkeys with venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, indicates that the acceleration of peripheral disposal of t4 seen in infection is not a simple concomitant of fever. in monkeys with bacterial sepsis and in those inoculated iv with zymosan particles, t4 turnover was similarly accelerated in the absence of detectable changes in serum free t4 levels, suggesting a pathogenetic role for enhances cellular uptake and metabolism of hormone. however, in these monkeys deiodination of t4 by leukocytes did not appear to account for the increase in t4 disposal. during sepsis and following zymosan administration, t4 turnover was markedly increased in both intact monkeys with a neutrophilic leukocytosis and in those with irradiation-induced neutropenia. therefore, the cellular sites of increased  t4 degradation during infection remain uncertain. fixed tissue macrophages serve  as the major site of clearance of yf virus, circulating bacteria and zymosan particles. accordingly, a relationship between activation of these phagocytic cells and the acceleration of t4 metabolism seemed possible but was not established by our studies.

TI  == bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  == human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, eh < -42 mv at ph 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic pmn. anaerobic pmn were able to kill staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus, viridans streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and peptococcus magnus normally. organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic pmn included staphylococcus  aureus (strains wood 46 and 502a), escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and salmonella typhimurium. these findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide  may be important in the killing of some bacteria.

TI  == epicillin: experimental chemotherapy, pharmacodynamics, and susceptibility testing.
AB  == epicillin exhibits excellent therapeutic activity when administered orally or subcutaneously to mice infected with a variety of pathogenic bacteria. these included single strains of streptococcus pyogenes, non-penicillinase-producing staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, salmonella schottmuelleri, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, strains of microorganisms selected as typical of those that frequently cause serious clinical infections. in oral chemotherapeutic comparisons of tetracycline, chloramphenicol, cephalexin, ampicillin, and epicillin, the latter, with but minor exceptions, exhibited activity comparable to that of most of the other antibiotics studied. oral administration to mice of a loading dose of epicillin or ampicillin resulted in similar peak blood levels and decay curves. the concentration in urine and the excretion rates were significantly higher in epicillin than in ampicillin-treated animals. presumptive evidence suggests that the inter-pretation of zone diameters obtained with 10-mug epicillin discs should be the same as is used for 10-mug ampicillin discs.

TI  == vitamin b12 uptake by intestinal microorganisms: mechanism and relevance to syndromes of intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
AB  == the mechanism of bacterial uptake of vitamin b(12), the spectrum of microorganisms capable of such uptake, and the factors involved were the subject  of this study. bacterial uptake of vitamin b(12) was found to be at least a two stage process. a primary uptake phase which was rapid (1 min or less), ph dependent, nontemperature dependent, did not require viable organisms and was insensitive to either the metabolic inhibitor dinitrophenol or to the sulfhydryl  inhibitor n-ethyl-maleimide. protein denaturation (formalin treatment or autoclaving) abolished all b(12) uptake. this primary uptake phase is thought to  represent adsorption to binding or "receptor" sites on the cell wall. second stage uptake was slower, ph and temperature dependent, required living bacteria,  and was abolished by either dinitrophenol or n-ethyl-maleimide. this phase is dependent upon metabolic processes and may reflect transfer of b(12) from surface "receptor" sites into the bacterial cell. although differences among organisms were observed in total 1 hr uptake, number of surface "receptor" sites, and relative avidities for b(12), all organisms except streptococcus fecalis shared the two stage mechanism. two gram-positive organisms. bacillus subtilis and group a streptococcus, demonstrated the highest 1 hr vitamin b(12) uptake values; gram-negative bacteria required 2,000-10,000 the number of organisms for comparable uptake. binding constants (k(m)) varied from 5.05 +/-1.67 x 10(-10)m for b. subtilis to 6.18 +/-3.08 x 10(-9)m for klebsiella pneumoniae which approximate the km for human intrinsic factor (0.38 x 10(-10)m). competition between bacteria and intrinsic factor for vitamin b(12) may be inferred from the  similarity of these constants. these observations suggest that a variety of enteric and nonenteric organisms, not requiring exogenous b(12), may play a role  in the pathogenesis of the vitamin b(12) malabsorption found in the intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndromes.

TI  == idiotypy of rabbit antibodies. i. comparison of idiotypy of antibodies against salmonella typhi with that of antibodies against other bacteria in the same rabbits, or of antibodies against salmonella typhi in various rabbits.
AB  == sera of rabbits immunized against salmonella typhi have been studied for the idiotypy of certain of their components, i.e., the property of these components to possess an antigenic specificity which is different in individual rabbits, and which varies with the antigens against which these rabbits have been immunized. the reagent used (precipitating anti-idiotypic sera) have been prepared by injecting rabbits with bacteria agglutinated by anti-s. typhi sera (immunizing sera) as was done in the first observations by the authors of the phenomenon in the rabbit. these first observations have been confirmed and extended. in contrast to allotypy, the anti-idiotypic sera precipitate the corresponding immunizing sera, but not the sera taken in the immunizing rabbits prior to their  immunization against s. typhi, nor the immunizing sera absorbed with the somatic  antigen of s. typhi, demonstrating that idiotypes are antibodies. the idiotypic specificities of the antibodies of one rabbit against s. typhi are not detected in the antibodies of the same rabbit against another noncross-reacting salmonella (s. tranoroa) and vice versa; nor are they detected in the anti-pneumococcal antibodies of the same rabbit. each anti-idiotypic serum fails to precipitate anti-s. typhi sera of rabbits other than the immunizing one except for certain extremely faint reactions, the significance of which has not been established. the idiotypic specificities of anti-s. typhi antibodies of three rabbits were not found in anti-s. typhi antibodies of their parents. this lack of a sign of hereditary transmission of idiotypic specificities contrasts with allotypy. the apparent role of random chance in the determinism of the idiotypic patterns or of the idiotypic determinants has been discussed. unless it were admitted that antibodies with similar functions do not exist in different individuals, idiotypy apparently adds an order of magnitude to the antibody variability which had been  previously envisaged. in one given individual, the heterogeneity of the idiotypic specificities seems to be less extended than that of the antibody functions. the  possible relationships between these two levels of molecular variability and between the corresponding levels of cellular variability have been discussed.

TI  == in vivo and in vitro action of norethindrone on staphylococci.
AB  == norethindrone has been examined in vitro for antibacterial activity against 10 microorganisms. turbidimetric techniques were used to assay the antibacterial activity of norethindrone. the organisms tested included staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococcus conglomeratus, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus  faecalis, salmonella typhosa, shigella flexnerii, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and proteus vulgaris. bacteriostatic action was shown only against the gram-positive microorganisms when they were grown anaerobically in tryptic soy broth containing 10 to 50 mug of norethindrone per ml. the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone was exerted primarily during the first 8 hr of incubation and it was reduced by the presence of oxygen. mestranol at a concentration of 1 to 10 mug/ml failed to exert any significant action on s. aureus. however, incorporation of 5 mug of mestranol per ml in the culture medium enhanced the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone on staphylococci. enhancement of the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone could not be obtained by the addition of a concentration of 5 mug/ml of testosterone, 17alpha-estradiol, and 17beta-estradiol. progesterone and 4-pregnen-20beta-ol-3-one under similar conditions showed an additive bacteriostatic effect when they were incorporated into the culture medium containing norethindrone. in vivo studies indicated that  female, adult new zealand rabbits, injected subcutaneously with two injections of 10 to 20 mug of norethindrone, 24 hr apart, and challenged intradermally with s.  aureus 4 hr after the second injection, had fewer lesions with smaller areas of swelling and erythema as compared to control, nontreated rabbits. the protective  effect of norethindrone on the development of staphylococcal lesion seemed related to hormone concentration. thus, it was demonstrated with doses of 20, 15, and 10 mug, but not with doses of 1 and 5 mug. when the lesions were excised 48 to 92 hr after infection and when viable cell counts were made, rabbits treated with norethindrone showed significantly lower staphylococcal counts than the control rabbits. during the 1st day after infection with s. aureus, leukocytic counts of the norethindrone-treated rabbits remained normal, whereas control animals showed elevated leukocytic counts.

TI  == bacterial interference induced in embryonated eggs by staphylococci.
AB  == studies of experimental infections in embryonated eggs demonstrated that prior allantoic infection with avirulent staphylococci afforded significant protection  against subsequent challenge with virulent strains. all strains of coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci tested that were relatively avirulent for embryonated eggs were capable of producing interference. the interference induced afforded protection not only against challenge with virulent staphylococci, but also against diplococcus pneumoniae, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and one strain of influenza virus (a(2)j 305). prior allantoic infection with avirulent staphylococci also protected against intravenous as well as allantoic infection with challenge strains.interference required infection with viable bacteria. the onset of interference appeared within a few minutes after injection of the interfering strain, but was not maximal until 24 hours had elapsed between injection of the interfering and challenge strains. the protection afforded by the production of interference could not be overcome by increased inoculum size of the challenge strain and extended even to challenge with 10(9) bacteria. studies of in vitro and in vivo growth of challenge strains in allantoic fluid demonstrated that some interfering strains inhibited growth of the challenge strains. other strains produced interference without producing prolonged inhibition of the growth of challenge strains. similarly, interference could not be attributed to attenuated  virulence of the challenge organisms. all interfering strains studied produced enhanced bactericidal activity of whole blood from the affected embryos, but whether this affected leukocyte activity, opsonization, or other host defense mechanisms has yet to be determined.

TI  == the bacterial induction of homograft sensitivity. ii. effects of sensitization with staphylococci and other microoorganisms.
AB  == heat-killed strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus albus can induce  in guinea pigs a state of altered reactivity to skin homografts which is indistinguishable from that which results from sensitization with homologous tissues or group a streptococci. challenge of suitably prepared recipients with first-set skin homografts obtained from unrelated randomly selected donors elicits white graft reactions or accelerated rejection of such grafts. other bacteria tested included lancefield streptococcal groups b, c, d, e, g, h, l, and o, pneumococcus types ii, iii, xiv and a rough strain, corynebacterium xerosis, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, aerobacter aerogenes, salmonella typhimurium, proteus vulgaris, neisseria catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, and two human virulent strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis. none of these microorganisms was active in the induction of homograft sensitivity in the guinea pig. pretreatment of recipients with gram-negative bacterial suspensions was associated with a slight increase in the mean survival time of first-set skin homografts. results of this study suggest the presence in staphylococci, as well  as in group a streptococci, of antigens related in their biologic effects to tissue transplantation antigens.

AB  == the effect of xanthines on various microorganisms was studied. the antibacterial  effect was not high; most of the test organisms could easily withstand a concentration of 2,500 mug/ml. caffeine was more antibacterial than theophylline, and the latter more than theobromine. caffeine citrate exhibited greater inhibitory effect than did pure caffeine. the effect was both bacteriostatic and  bactericidal against susceptible organisms. the susceptibility of organisms to xanthines differed greatly even in related species. the morphology of aerobacter  aerogenes and a. cloacae was affected under the influence of caffeine; filamentation of cells followed sublethal doses. potentiation was seen with antibiotics and caffeine; resistant strains were killed with a lower dose of drug in the presence of caffeine. this potentiating effect was pronounced with the tetracyclines; with streptomycin, the effect was the contrary.
