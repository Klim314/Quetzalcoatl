TI  == fast identification of wine related lactic acid bacteria by multiplex pcr.
AB  == the microflora of must and wine consists of yeasts, acetic acid bacteria and lactic acid bacteria (lab). the latter group plays an important role for wine quality. the malolactic fermentation carried out by lab leads to deacidification  and stabilisation of wines. nevertheless, lab are often associated with wine spoilage. they are mainly responsible for the formation of biogenic amines. furthermore, some strains produce exopolysaccharide slimes, acetic acid, diacetyl and other off-flavours. in this context a better monitoring of the vinification process is crucial to improve wine quality. moreover, a lot of biodiversity studies would also profit from a fast and reliable identification method. in this study, we propose a species-specific multiplex pcr system for a rapid and simultaneous detection of 13 lab species, frequently occurring in must or wine: lactobacillus brevis, lb. buchneri, lb. curvatus, lb. hilgardii, lb. plantarum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, oenococcus oeni, pediococcus acidilactici, p. damnosus, p. inopinatus, p. parvulus, p. pentosaceus and weissella paramesenteroides.

TI  == prevalent lactic acid bacteria in cider cellars and efficiency of oenococcus oeni strains.
AB  == malolactic fermentation (mlf) is an important step in cider production in order to allowing for improvement of microbiological stability and organoleptic characteristics of cider. induction of this fermentation by using starter cultures enables a better control over this bioprocess, but although it is a common practice in winemaking, starters specifically focussed for cider mlf are not yet commercially available. proper starter cultures need to present the ability to degrade l-malic acid conferring pleasing sensory characteristics while avoiding toxicological risks. in this work, lactic acid bacteria (lab) were first isolated from mlf industrial cider samples, obtained in a cellar in the main cider-producing region of spain, asturias. isolates, identified by molecular tools, belonged to the lactobacillus brevis and oenococcus oeni species. after a  phylogenetic analysis, representative strains of both identified species were evaluated in order to determine their fermentation capacity, showing o. oeni the  best behaviour in this cider fermentation, as previously demonstrated for wine in the literature. consequently, and with the aim to test the influence at strain level, selection of o. oeni isolates as starters for cider fermentation has been  undergone. in order to check the influence of geography over biodiversity, o. oeni strains from six different industrial cellars representing the distinct producing areas in the region (located in a ratio of 30 km) were analyzed by using a specific rapd method. in this way, isolates were typed in five distinct groups, mainly corresponding to each producing area. all strains isolated from the same cellar showed the same rapd profile revealing the significance of geographical origin in the indigenous cider lab. molecular tools were applied to  reject those isolates exhibiting presence of genes related to organoleptic spoilage (exopolysaccharides and acrolein production) or food safety (biogenic amine production), as key selection criteria. representative strains of each of the five o. oeni rapd groups were tested as pure cultures to evaluate their technological utility for cider production. experimental data of malic acid degradation and cell concentration obtained were fitted to previously selected kinetic models aimed to optimization and prediction of bioprocess performance. four strains revealed as suitable potential starter cultures for conducting mlf in cider production.

TI  == basic characterization and partial purification of beta-glucosidase from cell-free extracts of oenococcus oeni st81.
AB  == aims: this study was designed to characterize a beta-glucosidase of oenococcus oeni st81, a strain isolated from a spanish wine of the origin appellation ribeira sacra. methods and results: the beta-glucosidase of o. oeni st81 seems to have a periplasmic localization into the cells. this activity was strongly inhibited by gluconic acid, partially inhibited by glucose and not inhibited by fructose, lactate, malate, mannitol or sorbitol. ethanol increased the activity of this enzyme up to 147%. among the several metal ions assayed, only fe(2)(+) (10 mmol l(-)(1)) and cu(2)(+) (5 mmol l(-)(1)) exhibited a partial inhibitory effect (40%). this enzyme was partially purified using a combination of ammonium  sulfate precipitation and chromatographic methods. the single peak because of beta-glucosidase in all chromatographic columns indicates the presence of a single enzyme with an estimated molecular mass of 140 kda. the calculated k(m) and v(max) values for 4-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside were 0.38 mmol l(-)(1) and 5.21 nmol min(-)(1), respectively. the enzyme was stable at ph 5.0 with a value of t(1/2) = 50 days for the crude extract. conclusions: the beta-glucosidase of o. oeni st81 is substantially different from those characterized from other wine-related lactic acid bacteria (lab), such as lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus brevis; however, it appears to be closely related to a beta-glucosidase from o. oeni atcc baa-1163 cloned into escherichia coli. the periplasmic localization of the enzyme together with its high tolerance to ethanol and fructose, the low inhibitory effect of some wine-related compounds on the enzymatic activity and long-term stability of the enzyme could be of interest for winemaking. significance and impact of the study: information regarding a beta-glucosidase from o. oeni st81 is presented. although the release of aroma compounds by lab has been demonstrated, little information exists concerning the responsible enzymes. to our knowledge, this study contains  the first characterization of a native beta-glucosidase purified from crude extracts of o. oeni st81.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of a spontaneous cocoa bean fermentation metagenome reveals new insights into its bacterial and fungal community diversity.
AB  == this is the first report on the phylogenetic analysis of the community diversity  of a single spontaneous cocoa bean box fermentation sample through a metagenomic  approach involving 454 pyrosequencing. several sequence-based and composition-based taxonomic profiling tools were used and evaluated to avoid software-dependent results and their outcome was validated by comparison with previously obtained culture-dependent and culture-independent data. overall, this approach revealed a wider bacterial (mainly gamma-proteobacteria) and fungal diversity than previously found. further, the use of a combination of different classification methods, in a software-independent way, helped to understand the actual composition of the microbial ecosystem under study. in addition, bacteriophage-related sequences were found. the bacterial diversity depended partially on the methods used, as composition-based methods predicted a wider diversity than sequence-based methods, and as classification methods based solely on phylogenetic marker genes predicted a more restricted diversity compared with  methods that took all reads into account. the metagenomic sequencing analysis identified hanseniaspora uvarum, hanseniaspora opuntiae, saccharomyces cerevisiae, lactobacillus fermentum, and acetobacter pasteurianus as the prevailing species. also, the presence of occasional members of the cocoa bean fermentation process was revealed (such as erwinia tasmaniensis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and oenococcus oeni). furthermore, the sequence reads  associated with viral communities were of a restricted diversity, dominated by myoviridae and siphoviridae, and reflecting lactobacillus as the dominant host. to conclude, an accurate overview of all members of a cocoa bean fermentation process sample was revealed, indicating the superiority of metagenomic sequencing over previously used techniques.

TI  == dynamics of indigenous lactic acid bacteria populations in wine fermentations from la rioja (spain) during three vintages.
AB  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) species has been analyzed for three consecutive years (2006, 2007, and 2008) during alcoholic and malolactic fermentations of tempranillo wine in a winery at la rioja. the results showed differences in malolactic fermentation duration, and in both diversity of lab species and diversity of oenococcus oeni genotypes. o. oeni was shown to be the predominant species (73% of total isolates). monitoring the different strains of  o. oeni using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of chromosomal dna digested with sfii and apai allowed detection of a total of 37 distinct genotypes, most of them comprised at least two isolates. six appeared in more than one vintage, one of them being present in the three studied years. moreover, four genotypes were indistinct of the strains isolated from the air of this same winery in 2007 vintage. the frequency of participation of each genotype varied from year to year, thus dominant genotypes at one year were minority or not present at another year. this suggests that distinct indigenous o. oeni strains are better adapted to the different winery conditions every year. predominant genotypes that appeared in more than one vintage and lead to quality wines with low histamine contents could be considered as interesting for selecting of new malolactic starter cultures.

TI  == a beta-glucosidase from oenococcus oeni atcc baa-1163 with potential for aroma release in wine: cloning and expression in e. coli.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are responsible for olfactory changes in wine during malolactic fermentation (mlf). a side characteristic of mlf is the release of grape derived aroma compounds from their glycosylated precursors by beta-glycosidase activities of these bacteria. apart from oenococcus oeni, which  is regarded as the most promising species for mlf, glycosidic activities have also been observed in wine related members of the genera lactobacillus and pediococcus. nevertheless, information on the involved enzymes including their potential use in winemaking is limited. in this study we report that beta-glucosidases with similar protein sequences can be identified in the genomes of lactobacillus brevis, o. oeni and leuconostoc mesenteroides. ttg serves as start codon for the glucosidase gene of o. oeni. the beta-glucosidase of o. oeni  atcc baa-1163 was expressed in e. coli and partially characterized. the enzyme displayed characteristics similar to beta-glucosidases isolated from l. brevis and l. mesenteroides. a ph optimum between 5.0 and 5.5, and a k(m) of 0.17 mmol l(-1 )pnp-beta-d-glucopyranoside were determined. a glycosyltransferase activity  was observed in the presence of ethanol. the enzyme from o. oeni was capable to hydrolyze glycosides extracted from muskat wine. this study also contains a report on glycosidase activities of several lab species including oenococcus kitaharae.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria from musts and wines of three consecutive vintages of ribeira sacra.
AB  == aims: this study was designed to isolate and characterize the lactic acid microbiota of the musts and wines of a young denomination of origin area, ribeira sacra in north-west spain. methods and results: over three consecutive years (2007, 2008 and 2009), we examined musts and wines from four cellars in different zones of the region. through biochemical and genetic tests, 459 isolates of lactic acid bacteria (lab) were identified as the following species: lactobacillus alvei (0.7%), lactobacillus brevis (1.7%), lactobacillus frumenti (0.9%), lactobacillus kunkeei (12%), lactobacillus plantarum (6.5%), lactobacillus pentosus (0.9%), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (3%), leuconostoc citreum (0.7%), leuconostoc fructosum (synon. lactobacillus fructosum) (3.7%), leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. mesenteroides (2.8%), leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (0.2%), oenococcus oeni (59%), pediococcus parvulus (7%) and  weisella paramesenteroides (synon. leuconostoc paramesenteroides) (0.9%). of these species, o. oeni was the main one responsible for malolactic fermentation (mlf) in all cellars and years with the exception of lact. plantarum, predominant in 2007, in one cellar, and lact. brevis, lact. frumenti and ped. parvulus coexisting with o. oeni in one cellar in 2009. different strains (84) of lab species (14) were identified by biochemical techniques (api strips, the presence  of plasmids, enzyme activities and mlf performance) and molecular techniques (pcr). all assays were carried out with every one of the 459 isolates. to select  candidates for use as culture starters, we assessed malolactic, beta-glucosidase  and tannase activities, the presence of genes involved in biogenic amine production and plasmid content. conclusions: a high diversity of lab is present in the grape musts of ribeira sacra but few species are responsible for mlf; however, different strains of such species are involved in the process. as far as we are aware, this is the first report of lact. frumenti thriving in wine. significance and impact of the study: information on lab populations in must and  wine is presented. a large collection of well-characterized strains of lab are available as starter cultures to winemakers.

TI  == a comparative study of an intensive malolactic transformation of cider using lactobacillus brevis and oenococcus oeni in a membrane bioreactor.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the secondary fermentation of alcoholic  green cider by lactobacillus brevis and oenococcus oeni in a membrane bioreactor  so as to compare the performance of the two organisms to rapidly carry out the malolactic fermentation (mlf), an important step in reducing acidity and enhancing the flavor characteristics of the beverages. first, the growth of both  organisms was intensified by using perfusion culture in a membrane bioreactor (mbr). o. oeni and l. brevis were grown up to 12.8 g dry cell weight (dcw) l(-1)  and 15.5 g dcw l(-1) in the mbr. secondly, the resultant cells were then used for the malolactic transformation of green cider in the mbr. the influences of the residence time in the mbr and the ethanol concentration of the green cider on the organic acid transformation were investigated. both organisms showed a good tolerance against the acidic conditions (ph 3.0-4.0) and ethanol (90 g l(-1)). good levels of malate removal in the mbr were achieved by both organisms but o. oeni was more tolerant to high ethanol concentrations and was capable of growth and malate removal in 130 g ethanol l(-1) green cider. l. brevis malate removal was significantly inhibited above 110 g ethanol l(-1). the mbr allowed the development of high concentrations of active cells capable of rapid mlf and could be achieved over a prolonged period and over a wide range of conditions thus allowing the control of malate transformation rate. organism selection for the transformation will be governed by the desired beverage characteristics. there is considerable scope to optimize the process further both with the choice of organisms and the design and operation of the reactor. rapid beverage maturation  on a commercial scale may be possible using mbr and pure cultures of mlf lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == selectivity and antimicrobial action of bovine lactoferrin derived peptides against wine lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == in this study, the antibacterial activities of a bovine lactoferrin pepsin hydrolysate (lfh) and a synthetic peptide derived from bovine lactoferricin (lfcinb(17-31)) have been evaluated against oenococcus oeni and three additional  lactic acid bacteria (lab) known to cause spoilage during winemaking processes. inhibition of bacterial growth was demonstrated in vitro in synthetic broth media (mrs) for both lfh and lfcinb(17-31). the bactericidal activity of the synthetic  peptide was also assayed and found to vary depending on the bacterial species and the matrix in which exposure to peptide occurred (either mrs broth or white must). specificity of lfcinb(17-31) for lactobacillus brevis, pediococcus damnosus, and o. oeni was demonstrated in must fermentation experiments in which  these three lab co-existed with the winemaking saccharomyces cerevisiae t73 in the presence of the peptide. finally, fermentation experiments also showed that lfcinb(17-31) at inhibitory concentrations did not alter either fermentation kinetics or specific enological parameters.

TI  == molecular screening of wine lactic acid bacteria degrading hydroxycinnamic acids.
AB  == the potential to produce volatile phenols from hydroxycinnamic acids was investigated for lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from spanish grape must and  wine. a pcr assay was developed for the detection of lab that potentially produce volatile phenols. synthetic degenerate oligonucleotides for the specific detection of the pdc gene encoding a phenolic acid decarboxylase were designed. the pdc pcr assay amplifies a 321 bp dna fragment from phenolic acid decarboxylase. the pdc pcr method was applied to 85 strains belonging to the 6 main wine lab species. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and pediococcus pentosaceus strains produce a positive response in the pdc pcr assay, whereas oenococcus oeni, lactobacillus hilgardii, and leuconostoc mesenteroides strains did not produce the expected pcr product. the production of vinyl and ethyl derivatives from hydroxycinnamic acids in culture media was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. a relationship was found between pdc pcr  amplification and volatile phenol production, so that the lab strains that gave a positive pdc pcr response produce volatile phenols, whereas strains that did not  produce a pcr amplicon did not produce volatile phenols. the proposed method could be useful for a preliminary identification of lab strains able to produce volatile phenols in wine.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == production of biogenic amines by lactic acid bacteria: screening by pcr, thin-layer chromatography, and high-performance liquid chromatography of strains  isolated from wine and must.
AB  == biogenic amines are frequently found in wine and other fermented food. we investigated the ability of 133 strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from musts and wines of different origins to produce histamine, tyramine, and putrescine. we detected the genes responsible for encoding the corresponding amino acid decarboxylases through pcr assays using two primer sets for every gene: histidine decarboxylase (hdc), tyrosine decarboxylase (tdc), and ornithine  decarboxylase (odc); these primers were taken from the literature or designed by  us. only one strain of lactobacillus hilgardii was shown to possess the hdc gene, whereas four strains of lactobacillus brevis had the tdc gene. none of the oenococcus oeni strains, the main agents of malolactic fermentation, was a biogenic amine producer. all pcr amplicon band-positive results were confirmed by thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography analyses.

TI  == effect of protective agents, freezing temperature, rehydration media on viability of malolactic bacteria subjected to freeze-drying.
AB  == aims: the effects of protective agents, rehydration media and freezing temperature on the viabilities of lactobacillus brevis and oenococcus oeni h-2 when subjected to freeze-drying were investigated. methods and results: several protectants and rehydration media were tested to improve the survival after freeze-drying. the cells were also frozen at -65 and -20 degrees c to check the effect of freezing temperature on the viability. conclusions: the best protectant and rehydration medium to obtain the highest viability after freeze-drying varied with the species of bacteria. yeast extract (4.0%) and sodium glutamate (2.5% ) gave maximum viability of l. brevis and o. oeni (67.8% and 53.6% respectively). the highest survival of l. brevis and o. oeni were obtained when rehydrated with  10% sucrose and mgy medium respectively. when the bacterial cells were frozen quickly (-65 degrees c) than slowly (-20 degrees c), l. brevis and o. oeni both showed increased viability after freeze-drying. significance and impact of the study: the viabilities of l. brevis and o. oeni after freeze-drying were shown to be strain specific and dependent on protective agents, rehydration media and freezing temperature.

TI  == performance assessment of malolactic fermenting bacteria oenococcus oeni and lactobacillus brevis in continuous culture.
AB  == the growth performance of malolactic fermenting bacteria oenococcus oeni ncimb 11648 and lactobacillus brevis x(2) was assessed in continuous culture. o. oeni grew at a dilution rate range of 0.007 to 0.052 h(-1) in a mixture of 5:6 (g l(-1)) of glucose/fructose at an optimal ph of 4.5, and l. brevis x(2) grew at 0.010 to 0.089 h(-1) in 10 g l(-1) glucose at an optimal ph of 5.5 in a simple and safe medium. the cell dry weight, substrate uptake and product formation were monitored, as well as growth kinetics, yield parameters and fermentation balances were also evaluated under ph control conditions. a comparison of growth characteristics of two strains was made, and this showed significantly different  performance. o. oeni has lower maximum specific growth rate (mu(max)=0.073 h(-1)), lower maximum cell productivity (q (x) (max)=17.6 mg cell l(-1) h(-1)), lower maximum biomass yield (y (x/s) (max)=7.93 g cell mol(-1) sugar) and higher  maintenance coefficient (m (s)=0.45 mmol(-1) sugar g(-1) cell h(-1)) as compared  with l. brevis x(2) (mu(max)=0.110 h(-1); q (x) (max)=93.2 g(-1) cell mol(-1) glucose; y (x/s) (max)=22.3 g cell mol(-1) glucose; m (s)=0.21 mmol(-1) glucose g(-1) cell h(-1)). these data suggest a possible more productive strategy for their combined use in maturation of cider and wine.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from south african brandy base wines.
AB  == in brandy base wines, no sulphur dioxide is used and it therefore is ideal for the proliferation of lactic acid bacteria. as part of an extensive taxonomic survey within the ecological framework of south african vineyards and wineries, and the influence of naturally occurring lactic acid bacteria on the quality of wine and brandy, a total of 54 strains were isolated from grape juice and at different stages of brandy base wine production. the strains were identified using numerical analysis of total soluble cell protein patterns, 16s rrna sequence analyses and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using species-specific primers. the predominant species was oenococcus oeni (22 strains), but lactobacillus brevis (8 strains), lactobacillus paracasei (8 strains) and lactobacillus plantarum (6 strains) were also isolated frequently. many of the o. oeni strains were isolated from brandy base wines after completion of spontaneous malolactic fermentation (mlf). the lactobacillus spp. were isolated from all the  different stages of brandy base wine production. lb. plantarum was the dominant species in the juice, but disappeared during the later stages of production. however, lactobacillus hilgardii, lb. brevis and lb. paracasei were also isolated from base wine after spontaneous mlf. strains identified as lactobacillus vermiforme were isolated during the alcoholic fermentation and after mlf have been completed. total soluble cell protein patterns grouped o. oeni strains into  two phenotypic groups. two phenotypic clusters have also been identified for the  lb. brevis isolates. the lb. paracasei isolates all grouped in one cluster. this  is the first report of the presence of lb. paracasei and lb. vermiforme in brandy base wines. the presence of the lactobacillus spp. could be correlated to the decrease in quality of the base wine and distillate, while o. oeni strains were found to have a more favourable influence on the quality of base wine and distillates. these results shed some light on the ecology and oenological influence of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on the quality of south african brandy.

TI  == 16s-ardra, a tool for identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from grape  must and wine.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are found in a great variety of habitats, including grape must and wines. there is a close relationship between the species of lab which develop during fermentation and the eventual quality of the wine. for these reasons analytical techniques allowing fast and reliable identification of wine lab are needed. in this work a simple and accurate protocol for identifying species of lab isolated from grape must and wine is presented. this protocol is based on the amplification, directly from colony, of 16s rdna and later digestion with one of the following restriction enzymes bfai, msei and alui. a sequential use of the three enzymes is proposed to simplify lab wine identification, first msei, then bfai and finally, if necessary, alui digestion. the technique was able to discriminate 32 of the 36 lab reference species tested and allowed the identification of 342 isolates from musts and wines. the isolates belonged to the species: lactobacillus brevis, l. collinoides, l. coryniformis, l. bilgardii, l.  mali, l. paracasei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, oenococcus oeni, pediococcus parvulus and p. pentosaceus.

AB  == the nucleotide sequences of the genes encoding the f1f0-atpase beta-subunit from  oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, pediococcus damnosus, pediococcus parvulus, lactobacillus brevis and lactobacillus hilgardii  were determined. their deduced amino acid sequences showed homology values of 79-98%. data from the alignment and atpase tree indicated that o. oeni and l. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides formed a group well-separated from p. damnosus and p. parvulus and from the group comprises l. brevis and l. hilgardii. the n-terminus of the f1f0-atpase beta-subunit of o. oeni contains a stretch of additional 38 amino acid residues. the catalytic site of the atpase beta-subunit  of the investigated strains is characterized by the two conserved motifs ggagvgkt and gertre. the amplified atpd coding sequences were inserted into the pcrt7/ct-topo vector using ta-cloning strategy and transformed in escherichia coli. sds-page and western blot analyses confirmed that o. oeni has an atpase beta-subunit protein which is larger in size than the corresponding molecules from the investigated strains.

TI  == isolation, properties and behaviour of tyramine-producing lactic acid bacteria from wine.
AB  == wines containing high levels of biogenic amines were investigated for the presence of tyramine-producing strains. two different lactobacillus brevis (ioeb  9809 and ioeb 9901) able to produce the amine were isolated. none of the isolated strains identified as oenococcus oeni formed tyramine. in addition, other lact. brevis and lact. hilgardii strains from our collection (ioeb) and the american type culture collection (atcc) were strong tyramine producers. lactobacillus brevis ioeb 9809 and lact. hilgardii ioeb 9649 were found to produce tyramine and phenylethylamine simultaneously. the conditions that can influence tyramine formation in wine were evaluated for three strains of lact. brevis (ioeb 9809 and ioeb 9901) and lact. hilgardii (ioeb 9649). tyrosine was the major factor affecting tyramine formation and was enhanced by the presence of sugars, mainly glucose. tyrosine decarboxylase (tdc) activity greatly depended on the presence of the precursor, which suggested that tyrosine induced the tdc system. these results indicate that lactobacillus could be the lactic acid bacteria responsible for tyramine production in wine.
