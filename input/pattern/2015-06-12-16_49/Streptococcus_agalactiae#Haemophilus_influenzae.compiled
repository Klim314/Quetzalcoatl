TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of Juniperus excelsa Bieb. (Cupressaceae) grown in R. Macedonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are no information of the yield, chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of berries (EOB) or leaves (EOL) of Juniperus excelsa Bieb. (Cupressaceae) growing wild in R. Macedonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plant material was collected from two localities during two seasons. Essential oil composition was analyzed by gas chromatography/flame ionization detector/mass spectrometry (GC/FID/MS) and antimicrobial screening was made by disc diffusion and broth dilution method. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: EOB yield ranged from 1.6-9.4 ml/kg and from 8.9-13.9 ml/kg for EOL. Two chemotypes of essential oil were differentiated, alpha-pinene-type (with 70.81% alpha-pinene in EOB and 33.83% in EOL), also containing limonene, beta-pinene and beta-myrcene while the sabinene-type (with 58.85-62.58% sabinene in EOB and 28.52-29.49% in EOL), was rich in alpha-pinene, beta-myrcene, limonene, cis-thujone, terpinolene and alpha-thujene. The most sensitive bacteria to the antimicrobial activity of EOB was Haemophilus influenzae (MIC = 31 mul/ml). EOL have showed high activity towards: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae (MIC = 125 mul/ml). The pinene-type of essential oil showed moderate activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Corynebacterium spp. and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC >50%). The sabinene-type of the oil showed moderate activity to Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemopilus influenzae, Campylobacter jejuni and Escherichia coli (MIC >50%). No activity was observed toward Candida albicans. CONCLUSION: The analysis of EOB and EOL revealed two chemotypes (alpha-pinene and sabinene type) clearly depended on the geographical origin of the Macedonian Juniperus excelsa which also affected the antimicrobial activity of these oils.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils of Pinus peuce (Pinaceae) growing wild in R. Macedonia.
AB  - The chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils isolated from twigs with needles (T+N) and from twigs without needles (T-N) from wild Pinus peuce Griseb. (Pinaceae), from three different locations in R. Macedonia, were investigated. Essential oil yields of T+N ranged from 7.5 mL/kg to 12.5 mL/kg and for T-N from 13.8 mL/kg to 17.3 mL/kg. GC/FID/MS analysis of the essential oils revealed eighty-four components, representing 93.7-95.7% and 91.2-92.0% of the T+N and T-N oils, respectively. The major components in T+N and T-N oils were monoterpenes: alpha-pinene (23.8-39.9%, 21.2-23.3%), camphene (2.2-5.5%, 0.7-2.0%), beta-pinene (10.1-17.1%, 8.2-16.4%), myrcene (1.2-1.41%, 1.6-2.5%), limonene+beta-phellandrene (6.8-14.0%, 8.8-23.6%) and bornyl acetate (2.3-6.9%, 1.1-3.4%), followed by the sesquiterpenes: trans-(E)-caryophyllene (3.6-4.3%, 3.2-7.3%), germacrene D (7.1-9.5%, 5.0-10.3%) and delta-cadinene (2.1-3.1%, 3.3-4.2%, respectively). Antimicrobial screening of the essential oils was made by disk diffusion and broth dilution methods against 13 bacterial isolates of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and one strain of Candida albicans. T-N essential oils showed antimicrobial activity toward Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Candida albicans as well as Streptococcus agalactiae, Acinetobacter spp. and Haemophilus influenzae. The antimicrobial activity of T+N essential oils was greater, especially against Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pyogenes, Enterococcus and Candida albicans, followed by Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of all tested essential oils ranged from 15-125 muL/mL. Summarizing the obtained results, the antimicrobial activity of Pinus peuce T+N and T-N essential oils collected from different localities in R. Macedonia varied considerably. These alterations in the antimicrobial activity can be attributed to the differences in the quantitative composition and percentage amounts of the components present in the respective essential oils, although it was evident that there were no differences in the qualitative composition of the essential oils, regardless of the locality of collection, or the type of plant material (T+N or T-N).
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of AZD0914, a new spiropyrimidinetrione DNA gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent activity against Gram-positive, fastidious Gram-Negative, and atypical bacteria.
AB  - AZD0914 is a new spiropyrimidinetrione bacterial DNA gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent in vitro antibacterial activity against key Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae), fastidious Gram-negative (Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae), atypical (Legionella pneumophila), and anaerobic (Clostridium difficile) bacterial species, including isolates with known resistance to fluoroquinolones. AZD0914 works via inhibition of DNA biosynthesis and accumulation of double-strand cleavages; this mechanism of inhibition differs from those of other marketed antibacterial compounds. AZD0914 stabilizes and arrests the cleaved covalent complex of gyrase with double-strand broken DNA under permissive conditions and thus blocks religation of the double-strand cleaved DNA to form fused circular DNA. Whereas this mechanism is similar to that seen with fluoroquinolones, it is mechanistically distinct. AZD0914 exhibited low frequencies of spontaneous resistance in S. aureus, and if mutants were obtained, the mutations mapped to gyrB. Additionally, no cross-resistance was observed for AZD0914 against recent bacterial clinical isolates demonstrating resistance to fluoroquinolones or other drug classes, including macrolides, beta-lactams, glycopeptides, and oxazolidinones. AZD0914 was bactericidal in both minimum bactericidal concentration and in vitro time-kill studies. In in vitro checkerboard/synergy testing with 17 comparator antibacterials, only additivity/indifference was observed. The potent in vitro antibacterial activity (including activity against fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates), low frequency of resistance, lack of cross-resistance, and bactericidal activity of AZD0914 support its continued development.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluation of ceftaroline fosamil.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ceftaroline fosamil is a 5th generation cephalosporin with an in vitro spectrum of activity including Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella oxytoca, K. pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis. It is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) in adults. AREAS COVERED: This review covers the mechanism of action; bacterial resistance; pharmacokinetic characteristics in various patient populations; pharmacodynamic data in animal and in vitro models as well as human studies; efficacy observed in clinical trials for ABSSSI and CABP; and adverse effects. EXPERT OPINION: Ceftaroline provides in vitro bactericidal activity against methicillin-, vancomycin-, daptomycin-, and linezolid-resistant Gram-positive organisms and select Gram-negative pathogens. The pharmacodynamics of ceftaroline is similar to other beta-lactam agents. Ceftaroline exhibits a favorable adverse effect profile and is generally well tolerated. There is little data on clinical success of ceftaroline in patients with bacteremia or endocarditis other than what has been published in a small series of case reports. Randomized-control studies are needed to establish clinical outcomes and safety in these patient populations.
TI  - Comparative study of bacteriological culture and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) and multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot (mPCR/RLB) hybridization assay in the diagnosis of bacterial neonatal meningitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial meningitis is more common in the neonatal period than any other time in life; however, it is still a challenge for the evidence based diagnosis. Strategy for identification of neonatal bacterial meningitis pathogens is presented by evaluating three different available methods to establish evidence-based diagnosis for neonatal bacterial meningitis. METHODS: The cerebrospinal fluid samples from 56 neonates diagnosed as bacterial meningitis in 2009 in Beijing Children's Hospital were analyzed in the study. Two PCR based molecular assays, real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) and multiplex PCR based-reverse line blot hybridization (mPCR/RLB), were used to assess 7 common neonatal meningitis bacterial pathongens, including Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Listerisa monocytogenes, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus agalactiae. The findings in examinations of two assays were compared with the results obtained bacterial culture tests. RESULTS: Bacterial meningitis was identified in five cases (9%) by CSF cultures, 25 (45%) by RT-PCR and 16 (29%) by mPCR/RLB. One strain of S. epidermidis and one of E. faecalis were identified using mPCR/RLB but not by RT-PCR. In contrast, cultures identified one strain of S. pneumoniae which was missed by both PCR assays. Overall, the bacterial pathogens in 28 cases were identified with these three methods. Both RT-PCR and mPCR/RLB assays were more sensitive than bacterial culture, (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that both RT-PCR and mPCR/RLB assays have better sensitivity than bacterial culture. They are capable of detecting the pathogens in CSF samples with negative culture results.
TI  - Supraglottitis due to group B streptococcus in an adult with IgG4 and C2 deficiency: a case report and review of the literature.
AB  - Acute supraglottitis is a medical emergency as it can rapidly lead to airway compromise. With routine pediatric immunization for Hemophilus influenzae serotype b, supraglottitis is now more prevalent in adults, with a shift in the causative organisms and a change in the natural history of this disease. Here, we present a case of supraglottitis due to group B streptococcus that occurred in an adult with previously undetected immunoglobulin 4 (IgG4) and complement protein C2 deficiency.
TI  - Recent trends in pediatric bacterial meningitis in Japan--a country where Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae conjugated vaccines have just been introduced.
AB  - To investigate the trends in incidence and the characteristics of bacterial meningitis in Japan where Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine and 7-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV7) were introduced in 2008 and 2010, respectively, which was 5-20 years after their introduction in western countries. The nationwide Japanese survey of pediatric and neonatal bacterial meningitis was performed in 2011 and 2012. We analyzed the epidemiological and clinical data, and compared the information obtained in the previous nationwide survey database. We also investigated the risk factors for disease outcome. In the 2011-2012 surveys, 357 patients were evaluated. H. influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Escherichia coli were the main organisms. The number of patients hospitalized with bacterial meningitis per 1000 admissions decreased from 1.31 in 2009 to 0.43 in 2012 (p < 0.001). The incidence of H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae meningitis also decreased from 0.66 to 0.08 (p < 0.001), and 0.30 to 0.06 (p < 0.001), respectively. Only 0-2 cases with Neisseria meningitidis were reported each year throughout 2001-2012. The median patient age was 10-12 months in 2001-2011, and became lower in 2012 (2 month old) (p < 0.001). The fatality rate for S. agalactiae is the highest (5.9% (11/187)) throughout 2001-2012 among the four organisms. Risk factors for death and sequelae were convulsions at onset, low CSF glucose, S. agalactiae etiology, and persistent positive CSF culture. Hib vaccine and PCV7 decreased the rate of bacterial meningitis. Earlier introduction of these vaccines may have prevented bacterial meningitis among Japanese children.
TI  - Ceftaroline activity tested against contemporary Latin American bacterial pathogens (2011).
AB  - A total of 2484 target bacterial pathogens were collected (one per patient episode) from patients in 16 Latin American medical centers located in seven nations during 2011. Isolate identity was confirmed at a coordinating laboratory and susceptibility testing was performed for ceftaroline and comparator agents according to reference broth microdilution methods. A total of 30.0% of isolates were from respiratory tract, 29.4% from skin and skin structure, 21.4% from blood stream, 7.9% from urinary tract and 11.3% from other sites. Ceftaroline was active against Staphylococcus aureus (42.8% MRSA) with 83.6% of the isolates at </= 1 mg/L and all isolates at </= 2 mg/L (MIC5090, 0.25/2mg/L). National MRSA rates ranged from a low of 28.8% in Colombia to a high of 68.1% in Chile. All Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC50/90 values were at </= 0.015/</= 0.015 mg/L for both). All Streptococcus pneumoniae were susceptible to ceftaroline, linezolid, tigecycline and vancomycin. Susceptibility to ceftriaxone was at 88.4% (CLSI non-meningitis interpretive criteria) and 73.9% (CLSI meningitis interpretive criteria) for all S. pneumoniae. Ceftriaxone susceptibility was only at 33.3% (CLSI non-meningitis interpretive criteria) and 0.0% (CLSI meningitis interpretive criteria) for penicillin-intermediate (penicillin MIC, 4 mg/L) strains. All Haemophilus influenzae (29.4% beta-lactamase-positive) isolates were susceptible to ceftaroline, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin. For the Latin American region, the ESBL-phenotype rate was 37.6% for Escherichia coli and 53.3% for Klebsiella pneumoniae. Ceftaroline was not active against ESBL-phenotype strains but was active against >90.0% of the non-ESBL-phenotype. The spectrum of activity of ceftaroline against pathogens from Latin America indicates that it merits further study for its potential use in the Latin American region.
TI  - [Rapid identification of meningitis due to bacterial pathogens].
AB  - We constructed a new real-time PCR method to detect causative pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patient due to bacterial meningitis. The eight pathogens targeted in the PCR are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aurues, Neisseria meningitides, Listeria monocytogenes, Esherichia coli, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The total time from DNA extraction from CSF to PCR analysis was 1.5 hour. The pathogens were detected in 72% of the CSF samples (n=115) by real-time PCR, but in only 48% by culture, although the microorganisms were completely concordant. The detection rate of pathogens with PCR was significantly better than that with cultures in patients with antibiotic administration.In conclusion, detection with real-time PCR is useful for rapidly identifying the causative pathogens of meningitis and for examining the clinical course of chemotherapy.
TI  - Superior sensitivity and decreased time to detection with the Bactec Peds Plus/F  system compared to the BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN blood culture system.
AB  - Here, we compare the sensitivities and times to detection (TTD) of BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN (PF) and Bactec Peds Plus blood culture bottles. Test bottles were inoculated with 2 ml of banked whole blood, 1-ml aliquots of antibiotic suspension, and organisms diluted to simulate a bacteremia level of 10 to 100 CFU/ml. The control bottles were inoculated with 3 ml of banked blood and organism suspensions only. The organism-drug combinations were Staphylococcus epidermidis and vancomycin, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin, Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone, Streptococcus agalactiae, ampicillin, and cefotaxime, Escherichia coli, cefotaxime, and cefepime, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, and gentamicin, Neisseria meningitidis and ceftriaxone, and Haemophilus influenzae and ceftriaxone. The control and test bottle combinations were tested in duplicate. The bottles were incubated for 5 days; 32 control and 104 test bottles were incubated. Overall, the bacterial recovery rates for the PF and Peds Plus bottles were 37% and 62%, 94% and 100% in the controls, 19% and 50% in the test bottles, and 33% and 92% in the bottles with vancomycin, respectively. No bacteria were recovered from the bottles with S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, E. coli, N. meningitidis, or H. influenzae in combination with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. The Peds Plus system detected P. aeruginosa in bottles with cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam, but the PF system recovered bacteria only in bottles with trough levels of piperacillin-tazobactam. The mean TTD were shorter in the Peds Plus system controls (14.2 versus 18.0 h; P = 0.001) and the test bottles (14.3 versus 17.8 h; P = 0.008) than in the PF bottles. Overall, we demonstrated superior sensitivity, TTD, and antibiotic neutralization in the Bactec Peds Plus system compared to those in the Pediatric FAN system.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the CANWARD surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 Canadian hospitals from January 2010 to December 2012. In total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method (document M07-A9, 2012), with MICs interpreted by using CLSI breakpoints (document M100-S23, 2013). Ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (MIC90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii, and Haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, C. freundii, and H. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to CLSI MIC interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. Ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of Enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (P. mirabilis) to 54.0% (S. marcescens). All isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity against staphylococci or streptococci. All isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.03 mug/ml), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. We conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and AmpC-producing E. coli and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in children in Iceland, 1975-2010: a nationwide epidemiological study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial meningitis is a serious and potentially rapid life-threatening disease. Therefore, to ensure appropriate treatment, early recognition of signs and symptoms is imperative, along with knowledge of the epidemiology and microbiology of the disease. METHODS: A long-term, nationwide epidemiological study of bacterial causes of meningitis in children (</= 18 y) in Iceland during the period 1975-2010 was carried out. A detailed chart review was performed of all cases diagnosed in 1995-2010. RESULTS: A total of 477 children were diagnosed with bacterial meningitis during the period 1975-2010. Of these, 67% were aged under 5 y. The most common pathogens were Neisseria meningitidis (n = 265), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 132), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 47), and Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 19); their incidences varied according to age. The age-specific incidence (cases/100,000/y) dropped from 26 in 1975 to 1 in 2010 (p < 0.001). The most common symptoms during the period 1995-2010 were fever (92%), vomiting (67%), nuchal rigidity (60%), and rashes/petechiae (51%). H. influenzae type b disappeared following implementation of Hib vaccination in 1989, and, likewise, the incidence of meningococcal meningitis fell significantly after vaccination against meningococcus serogroup C was initiated in 2002 (p < 0.001). The overall 30-day case fatality rate of bacterial meningitis was 4.4% and remained unchanged during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of childhood bacterial meningitis has been reduced significantly by successful vaccinations against H. influenzae type b and N. meningitidis serogroup C. Nevertheless, the case fatality rate has remained unchanged and thus the disease is still a serious threat to childhood health. Further prevention by novel vaccines and improved management of childhood meningitis is an exciting challenge.
TI  - Prospective multi-centre sentinel surveillance for Haemophilus influenzae type b  & other bacterial meningitis in Indian children.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) is one of the leading bacterial causes of invasive disease in populations without access to Hib conjugate vaccines (Hib-CV). India has recently decided to introduce Hib-CV into the routine immunization programme in selected States. Longitudinal data quantifying the burden of bacterial meningitis and the proportion of disease caused by various bacteria are needed to track the impact of Hib-CV once introduced. A hospital-based sentinel surveillance network was established at four places in the country and this study reports the results of this ongoing surveillance. METHODS: Children aged 1 to 23 months with suspected bacterial meningitis were enrolled in Chennai, Lucknow, New Delhi, and Vellore between July 2008 and June 2010. All cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were tested using cytological, biochemical, and culture methods. Samples with abnormal CSF (>/=10 WBC per mul) were tested by latex agglutination test for common paediatric bacterial meningitis pathogens. RESULTS: A total of 708 patients with abnormal CSF were identified, 89 of whom had a bacterial pathogen confirmed. Hib accounted for the majority of bacteriologically confirmed cases, 62 (70%), while Streptococcus pneumoniae and group B Streptococcus were identified in 12 (13%) and seven (8%) cases, respectively. The other eight cases were a mix of other bacteria. The proportion of abnormal CSF and probable bacterial meningitis that was caused by Hib was 74 and 58 per cent lower at Christian Medical College (CMC), Vellore, which had a 41 per cent coverage of Hib-CV among all suspected meningitis cases, compared to the combined average proportion at the other three centres where a coverage between 1 and 8 per cent was seen (P<0.001 and P= 0.05, respectively). INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Hib was found to be the predominant cause of bacterial meningitis in young children in diverse geographic locations in India. Possible indications of herd immunity was seen at CMC compared to sites with low immunization coverage with Hib-CV. As Hib is the most common pathogen in bacterial meningitis, Hib-CV would have a large impact on bacterial meningitis in Indian children.
TI  - Bacterial isolates from cerebrospinal fluid of children with suspected acute meningitis in a Nigerian tertiary hospital.
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the common aetiolog of acute bacterial meningitis in children and their antibiotic susceptibility pattern. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study with a review of cerebrospinal fluid culture reports of paediatric patients aged 0-15 years, suspected of acute meningitis in the Medical Microbiology Department of Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, Kano, Nigeria from October 2006 to October 2009 from October 2006 to October 2009. RESULTS: A positive culture bacterial isolation rate of 3.3% (n=50/1500) with prevalence of Streptococcus pneumoniae (24%), Neisseria meningitidis (22%), Escherichia coli (16%), Haemophilus influenzae (14%), Group B streptococci (8%) and Enterococci (8%) which were susceptible to ceftriaxone (96%), cefotaxime (95%) and ciprofloxacin (93%) across the bacterial isolates. Neonates were 55% (n=6.8/12.4) most at risk. CONCLUSION: Neonates are the most at risk of acute bacterial meningitis. In the absence of antibiotic susceptibility report, ceftriaxone should be considered as a first choice reliable antibiotic for empirical treatment of meningitis in children, in this environment.
TI  - [Childhood bacterial meningitis trends in Japan from 2009 to 2010].
AB  - We conducted a pediatric survey of bacterial meningitis epidemiology from January 2009 to December 2010 in Japan, and obtained the following results for 314 cases (186 boys, 124 girls, and 4 with gender not reported). Children younger than one year old accounted for the majority of cases (51.2%, 161/314), and the incidence decreased with increasing age. Haemophilus influenzae (in children aged 1 month to 5 years old) was the most common cause of infection (53.2%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 month to 12 years, 24.2%), Streptococcus agalactiae (0-4 months, 7.6%), and Escherichia coli (0-3 months, 3.2%). Susceptibility tests showed that 50.1% (78/153) of the H. influenzae isolates and 63.0% (46/73) of the S. pneumoniae isolates were drug-resistant. Combinations of ampicillin and cephem or carbapenem and other beta-lactams were mainly used as the initial antibiotics for patients under 4 months of age (77.8%, 42/54), and a carbapenem and other beta-lactam combination was used for patients aged 4 months and older (76.4%, 198/259). The final antibiotics for H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were mainly cefotaxime (CTX) or ceftriaxone (CTRX) and carbapenem, respectively. The overall fatality rate was 2.0% (6/305). Since the Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Hib vaccine) and the 7 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) are not widely used in Japan, only 5 patients in our cohort (all with meningitis not caused by H. influenzae) had been immunized with the Hib vaccine, and none had been immunized with the PCV7 vaccine. No remarkable changes in the characteristics of pediatric meningitis have been observed for several years in Japan.
TI  - [Meningitis and encephalitis in Poland in 2010].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Annually 2 000-3 000 cases of meningitis and encephalitis are notified to the Polish surveillance system. The leading etiologic agents of the bacterial infections are: N. meningitidis, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae type B and L. monocytogenes. The most common causes of bacterial infections in children are: E. coli, S. agalactiae and H. influenzae type B. The viral infections are mainly caused by the following pathogens: Echovirus, Coxsackie virus group A and B. The agents responsible for the viral infections are also: arboviruses, Herpes simplex virus and mumps virus. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the present article are to analyze the epidemiology of meningitis and encephalitis in Poland in 2010 and to present the information on the vaccines used to prevent the discussed infections. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The analysis was based on the data retrieved from the questionnaires used for the surveillance purposes, aggregated data on meningitis and encephalitis published in "Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland in 2010", aggregated data on the vaccination coverage published in "Vaccinations in Poland in 2010", "Case definitions for the infectious diseases used for the surveillance purposes in 2009-2011" and Polish Immunization Programme for 2010. RESULTS: In 2010, Poland reported 3 063 neuroinfections--nearly 22% more than in 2009. The incidence rate was 8.03 cases per 100 000 population. From the analysis of data transpired that of the notified cases, 1 619 were of viral etiology, 846--were bacterial and 598 of other or unknown origin. Given the bacterial infections of determined etiology, the leading pathogenic agent was S. pneumoniae (180 cases), following by N. meningitidis (146 cases) and Haemophilus influenzae typu B (11 cases). Among confirmed cases of the viral infections, the predominant were tick-borne encephalitis cases (294). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the data from 2009, the epidemiologic situation of the meningitis and encephalitis in Poland in 2010 has not changed significantly.
TI  - Interim susceptibility testing for ceftaroline, a new MRSA-active cephalosporin:  selecting potent surrogate beta-lactam markers to predict ceftaroline activity against clinically indicated species.
AB  - Ceftaroline, the bio-active form of parenterally administered ceftaroline fosamil, is a unique broad-spectrum cephalosporin with in vitro and in vivo activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and was approved for clinical use by the United States Food and Drug Administration in October 2010. In over a year since ceftaroline fosamil approval, no widely used commercial susceptibility test system has added this new compound to its product, therefore requiring use of alternative agar diffusion methods for clinical microbiology laboratories that want to test clinical isolates for ceftaroline susceptibility. An alternative strategy of applying a surrogate beta-lactam class marker agent was assessed here, using results from 14,902 organisms (2008-2010) sampled in the USA. Very high and acceptable accuracy (>/= 99.75%) was observed for predicting ceftaroline susceptibility as follows: 1) use of imipenem or meropenem minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) at </= 8 mug/mL (susceptible and intermediate categories) when testing S. aureus; 2) use of ceftriaxone MIC at </= 2 mug/mL (susceptible and intermediate categories) when testing Streptococcus pneumoniae as well as other streptococci (S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae); and 3) use of ceftriaxone, or cefepime, or ceftazidime at </= 2 mug/mL (susceptible category) when testing Haemophilus influenzae. Only when testing indicated Enterobacteriaceae species using ceftriaxone susceptibility results did the ceftaroline-nonsusceptible errors increase (4.11%). These presented analyses offer a validated surrogate marker strategy for ceftaroline susceptibility testing, pending development and validation by the commonly used automated systems and agar diffusion commercial methods.
TI  - Development of a single-tube loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for detection of four pathogens of bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Several loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays have been developed  to detect common causative pathogens of bacterial meningitis (BM). However, no LAMP assay is reported to detect Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus suis, which are also among common pathogens of BM. Moreover, it is laborious and expensive by performing multiple reactions for each sample to detect bacterial pathogen. Thus, we aimed to design and develop a single-tube LAMP assay capable of detecting multiple bacterial species, based on the nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA genes of the bacteria. The nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA genes of main pathogens involved in BM were aligned to identify conserved regions, which were further used to design broad range specific LAMP assay primers. We successfully designed a set of broad range specific LAMP assay primers for simultaneous detection of four species including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. suis and S. agalactiae. The broad range LAMP assay was highly specific without cross-reactivity with other bacteria including Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and Escherichia coli. The sensitivity of our LAMP assay was 100-1000 times higher compared with the conventional PCR assay. The bacterial species could be identified after digestion of the LAMP products with restriction endonuclease DdeI and HaeIII.
TI  - Chemical composition of 8 eucalyptus species' essential oils and the evaluation of their antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 1957, Tunisia introduced 117 species of Eucalyptus; they have been used as fire wood, for the production of mine wood and to fight erosion. Actually, Eucalyptus essential oil is traditionally used to treat respiratory tract disorders such as pharyngitis, bronchitis, and sinusitis. A few investigations were reported on the biological activities of Eucalyptus oils worldwide. In Tunisia, our previous works conducted in 2010 and 2011 had been the first reports to study the antibacterial activities against reference strains. At that time it was not possible to evaluate their antimicrobial activities against clinical bacterial strains and other pathogens such as virus and fungi. METHODS: The essential oils of eight Eucalyptus species harvested from the Jbel Abderrahman, Korbous (North East Tunisia) and Souinet arboreta (North of Tunisia) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities by disc diffusion and microbroth dilution methods against seven bacterial isolates: Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. In addition, the bactericidal, fungicidal and the antiviral activities of the tested oils were carried out. RESULTS: Twenty five components were identified by GC/FID and GC/MS. These components were used to correlate with the biological activities of the tested oils. The chemical principal component analysis identified three groups, each of them constituted a chemotype. According to the values of zone diameter and percentage of the inhibition (zdi, % I, respectively), four groups and subgroups of bacterial strains and three groups of fungal strains were characterized by their sensitivity levels to Eucalyptus oils. The cytotoxic effect and the antiviral activity varied significantly within Eucalyptus species oils. CONCLUSIONS: E. odorata showed the strongest activity against S. aureus, H. influenzae, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae and against all the tested fungal strains. In addition, E. odorata oil showed the most cytotoxic effect. However, the best antiviral activity appeared with E. bicostata. Virus pretreatment with E. bicostata essential oil showed better antiviral activity (IC(50) = 0.7 mg/ml, SI = 22.8) than cell-pretreatment (IC(50) = 4.8 mg/ml, SI = 3.33). The essential oil of E. astringens showed antiviral activity only when incubated with virus prior to cell infection. This activity was dose-dependent and the antiviral activity diminished with the decreasing essential oil concentration.
TI  - A multi-target real-time PCR assay for rapid identification of meningitis-associated microorganisms.
AB  - A central nervous system (CNS) infection, such as meningitis, is a serious and life-threatening condition. Bacterial meningitis can be severe and may result in brain damage, disability or even death. Rapid diagnosis of CNS infections and identification of the pathogenic microorganisms are needed to improve the patient outcome. Bacterial culture of a patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is currently considered the "gold standard" for diagnosing bacterial meningitis. From the CSF cultures researchers can assess the in vitro susceptibility of the causative microorganism to determine the best antibiotic treatment. However, many of the culture assays, such as microscopy and the latex agglutination test are not sensitive. To enhance pathogen detection in CSF samples we developed a multi-target real-time PCR assay that can rapidly identify six different microorganisms: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Listeria monocytogenes and Cryptococcus neoformans. In this study we applied this PCR analysis to 296 CSF samples from patients who were suspected of having meningitis. Of the 296 samples that were examined, 59 samples were positive according to the CSF culture and/or molecular assays. Forty-six CSF samples were positive for both the CSF culture and our real-time PCR assay, while 13 samples were positive for the real-time PCR but negative for the traditional assays. This discrepancy may have been caused by the fact that these samples were collected from 23 patients who were treated with antimicrobials before CSF sampling.
TI  - Detection of acute childhood meningitis by PCR, culture and agglutination tests in Tabriz, Iran.
AB  - Meningitis is one of the hazardous and life threatening infections and is associated with mortality and morbidity. The aim of this study was to determine etiological agents of childhood bacterial meningitis. The culture, Gram staining, agglutination and PCR assays were used to examine CSF specimens from 277 patients with presumed bacterial meningitis for the occurrence of 4 most common infectious agents consist of N. meningitis, H. influnsae, S. pneumoniae and S. agalactiae between 2008 and 2009 at different wards of the Children Hospital of Tabriz. The mean age of patients was 35 +/- 2 (Mean +/- SEM) month, (minimum 11 days maximum 14 years), of all cases 59.6% male and 40.4% female. Overall the diagnosis was confirmed with a CSF culture in 11/277 (3.97%), by agglutination test in 14/277 (5.05%). The isolated bacteria included S. pneumoniae 5 cases, H. influnsae 2 cases, N. meningitis 3 cases and P. aeroginusae 1 case. A positive PCR assay allowed us to diagnose bacterial meningitis in 19 patients (6.8%). In the present study, we found PCR to be a useful and sensitive method for the detection of bacterial DNA in the CSF samples from suspected meningitis patients. Furthermore, to maximize management of meningitis cases, a combination of culture and PCR is necessary.
TI  - Clinico-radiological features of subarachnoid hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted images in patients with meningitis.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the clinical and radiological features of meningitis with subarachnoid diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) hyperintensity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical features, laboratory data, and radiological findings, including the number and distribution of subarachnoid DWI hyperintense lesions and other radiological abnormalities, of 18 patients seen at five institutions were evaluated. RESULTS: The patients consisted of eight males and 10 females, whose ages ranged from 4 months to 82 years (median 65 years). Causative organisms were bacteria in 15 patients, including Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Listeria monocytogenes. The remaining three were fungal meningitis caused by Cryptococcus neoformans. Subarachnoid DWI hyperintense lesions were multiple in 16 of the 18 cases (89%) and predominantly distributed around the frontal lobe in 16 of the 18 cases (89%). In addition to subarachnoid abnormality, subdural empyema, cerebral infarction, and intraventricular empyema were found in 50, 39, and 39%, respectively. Compared with paediatric patients, adult patients with bacterial meningitis tended to have poor prognoses (7/10 versus 1/5; p = 0.1). CONCLUSION: Both bacterial and fungal meningitis could cause subarachnoid hyperintensity on DWI, predominantly around the frontal lobe. This finding is often associated with poor prognosis in adult bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Susceptibility of bacterial isolates from community-acquired infections in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia to macrolide antibiotics.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the susceptibility of common community pathogens in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia to the macrolide antibiotics. METHODS: Inclusion criteria required that isolates were collected since 2004 to ensure results were of contemporary relevance. The data were aggregated by region, age group and sterility of site of culture sample. RESULTS: A total of 51 studies were identified, which reported the macrolide antimicrobial susceptibilities of common bacterial pathogens isolated since 2004. In general, there was less macrolide resistance in African than in Asian isolates. Most African studies reported high levels of macrolide susceptibility in Streptococcus pneumoniae, whereas most Chinese studies reported high levels of resistance. There was very little information available for Gram-negative organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Susceptibility of the pneumococcus to macrolides in SSA remains high in many areas, and good activity of azithromycin has been shown against Salmonellae spp. in Asia. In urban areas where high antibiotic consumption is prevalent, there was evidence of increased resistance to macrolides. However, there is no information on susceptibility from large areas in both continents.
TI  - Etiology of invasive bacterial infections in immunocompetent children in Korea (1996-2005): a retrospective multicenter study.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify the major etiological agents responsible for invasive bacterial infections in immunocompetent Korean children. We retrospectively surveyed invasive bacterial infections in immunocompetent children caused by eight major pediatric bacteria, namely Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella species that were diagnosed at 18 university hospitals from 1996 to 2005. A total of 768 cases were identified. S. agalactiae (48.1%) and S. aureus (37.2%) were the most common pathogens in infants younger than 3 months. S. agalactiae was a common cause of meningitis (73.0%), bacteremia without localization (34.0%), and arthritis (50%) in this age group. S. pneumoniae (45.3%) and H. influenzae (20.4%) were common in children aged 3 months to 5 yr. S. pneumoniae was a common cause of meningitis (41.6%), bacteremia without localization (40.0%), and bacteremic pneumonia (74.1%) in this age group. S. aureus (50.6%), Salmonella species (16.9%), and S. pneumoniae (16.3%) were common in older children. A significant decline in H. influenzae infections over the last 10 yr was noted. S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, and S. aureus are important pathogens responsible for invasive bacterial infections in Korean children.
TI  - Socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in the incidence of bacteremic pneumonia among US adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We examined associations between the socioeconomic characteristics of census tracts and racial/ethnic disparities in the incidence of bacteremic community-acquired pneumonia among US adults. METHODS: We analyzed data on 4870 adults aged 18 years or older with community-acquired bacteremic pneumonia identified through active, population-based surveillance in 9 states and geocoded to census tract of residence. We used data from the 2000 US Census to calculate incidence by age, race/ethnicity, and census tract characteristics and Poisson regression to estimate rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: During 2003 to 2004, the average annual incidence of bacteremic pneumonia was 24.2 episodes per 100 000 Black adults versus 10.1 per 100 000 White adults (RR = 2.40; 95% CI = 2.24, 2.57). Incidence among Black residents of census tracts with 20% or more of persons in poverty (most impoverished) was 4.4 times the incidence among White residents of census tracts with less than 5% of persons in poverty (least impoverished). Racial disparities in incidence were reduced but remained significant in models that controlled for age, census tract poverty level, and state. CONCLUSIONS: Adults living in impoverished census tracts are at increased risk of bacteremic pneumonia and should be targeted for prevention efforts.
TI  - The causative organisms of bacterial meningitis in Korean children in 1996-2005.
AB  - Bacterial meningitis remains a serious cause of morbidity and mortality in childhood, despite the availability of effective vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) or Streptococcus pneumoniae. The purpose of this study was to analyze data on bacterial meningitis cases in Korea from 1996 through 2005. The information of all hospitalized bacteria-proven meningitis cases was obtained from 17 university hospitals nationwide. A total of 402 cases were identified. Of these, 125 (29.9%) cases were neonates. Streptococcus agalactiae was the most common bacteria responsible for 99 (24.6%) of all cases regardless of age, followed by S. pneumoniae for 91 (22.6%) and H. influenzae for 67 (16.7%) patients. The common etiology beyond the neonatal period was S. pneumoniae for 91 (33.0%) followed by H. influenzae for 63 (22.8%) patients. The overall case fatality rate was 9.4%, which was similar with that in 1986-1995. In conclusion, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were important etiologic agents of bacterial meningitis in children in the last 10 yrs. It is required to establish the preventive strategy of the three bacteria. The nationwide epidemiologic study should be continued to evaluate immunization strategy and efficacy.
TI  - Mechanisms of meningeal invasion by a bacterial extracellular pathogen, the example of Neisseria meningitidis.
AB  - The blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier physiologically protects the meningeal spaces from bloodborne bacterial pathogens, due to the existence of specialized junctional interendothelial complexes. A few bacterial pathogens are able to reach the subarachnoidal space and cause bacterial meningitis in humans, a rare but dreadful disease. Surprisingly, most of them are extracellular commensals of the nasopharynx (Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae) or of the digestive tract (Escherichia coli and Streptococcus agalactiae). The particular ability of these pathogens to induce meningitis is related to virulence factors that allow them to escape host innate immunity, to multiply within the serum, and to interact closely with the endothelial front line of defense of the blood-CSF barrier. In vitro studies using microvascular brain endothelial cell lines have shown that induced transcytosis may be a common route used by H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, E. coli and S. agalactiae to reach the CSF. N. meningitidis is a strict human pathogen that interacts very tightly with endothelial cells. Adhesion of the meningococcus is mediated by type IV pili that induce a localized remodeling of the sub cortical cytoskeleton, leading to the formation of endothelial membrane protrusions that anchor bacterial colonies at the endoluminal face of the endothelial cell membrane, allowing a better resistance to blood flow. Recent work has shown that N. meningitidis is also able to recruit the polarity complex Par3/Par6/aPKC that re-routes endothelial cell adhesion molecules of interendothelial junctions, opening a paracellular route for bacteria to cross the endothelial barrier.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of quinolones against various clinically isolated strains and evaluation of efficacy based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics theory].
AB  - We compared the antimicrobial activities of oral quinolones, ciprofloxacin (CPFX), gatifloxacin (GFLX), garenoxacin (GRNX), levofloxacin (LVFX), moxifloxacin (MFLX), norfloxacin (NFLX), prulifloxacin (PUFX), and tosufloxacin (TFLX) using Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, extended spectrum beta-lactamase(ESBL) producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) isolated from clinical materials. Based on the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics theory, the target attainment rate at the area under the curve (AUC)/MIC of 120 or more for Gram-negative and 30 or more for Gram-positive bacteria was calculated using Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), and was assessed as the efficacy. GRNX showed the lowest MIC50 and MIC90 values (0.03 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively) against S. pneumoniae, suggesting its potent antimicrobial activity. GRNX also exhibited the most potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, MSSA) other than S. pneumoniae. The antimicrobial activity of CPFX against H. influenzae was most potent. The MIC50 and MIC90 values were 0.016 microg/ml each. However, the MIC50 and MIC90 values of the other agents were also favorable. PUFX showed the most potent antimicrobial activity against ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae. Both of MIC50 and MIC90 values were 0.06 and 1 microg/ml, respectively. On efficacy assessment using MCS, GRNX, GFLX, and MFLX showed a probability of 90% or more against S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Against S. agalactiae, GRNX, MFLX, and GFLX showed a probability of approximately 60%. All agents showed a low probability against ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae; PUFX showed a maximum (43.63%). GRNX, MFLX, GFLX, and LVFX showed a probability of 90% or more against MSSA. Furthermore, we investigated the probability that the target value of resistance inhibition, an AUC/MIC of more than 200 against S. pneumoniae, is achieved. GRNX showed the highest probability (95.05%). It also exhibited a similar probability even when the target value was established as 250. Recently, the widespread use of quinolones has increased the number of quinolone-resistant bacteria. In the future, antimicrobial agents should be selected with respect to more potent therapeutic effects and resistance inhibition, and an appropriate dose and administration method must be employed.
TI  - Real-time PCR detection of five prevalent bacteria causing acute meningitis.
AB  
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms: tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial 2004 to 2007.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial began in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Against Gram negatives (n = 63 699), tigecycline MIC(90)'s ranged from 0.25 to 2 mg/L for Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens (but was > or =32 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Against Gram-positive organisms (n = 32 218), tigecycline MIC(90)'s were between 0.06 and 0.25 mg/L for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. The in vitro activity of tigecycline was maintained against resistant phenotypes, including multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (9.2% of isolates), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (7.0%) and K. pneumoniae (14.0%), beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae (22.2%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (44.5%), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (45.9%) and E. faecalis (2.8%), and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (13.8%). Tigecycline represents a welcome addition to the armamentarium against difficult to treat organisms.
TI  - Clinical significance of cerebrospinal fluid inhibitory titers of antibiotics, based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters, in the treatment of bacterial meningitis.
AB  - The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inhibitory titer (CSF-IT) of an antibiotic, which can be used to estimate the duration of time above the agent's MIC in the CSF, was introduced as one of the indices to evaluate the effectiveness of antibiotic selection in treating bacterial meningitis. The CSF-IT was determined via a microdilution method. A suspension of the causative organism was added to a tube containing twofold diluted CSF and double-concentrated Mueller-Hinton broth with supplement. The CSF-IT was determined by the maximum point without turbidity of medium after overnight incubation at 37 degrees C. Concerning the strain of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae (BLNAR), the killing rates of both meropenem and piperacillin were compared in an in vitro pharmacokinetic (PK) model, in which human pharmacokinetics in CSF were simulated. Organisms recovered from the CSF in 37 treated clinical cases of bacterial meningitis were H. influenzae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Neisseria meningitidis; in these cases, the CSF-IT ranged from 1: 8 to as high as 1: 4 096. In the in vitro PK model, the concentrations of both drugs were higher than the MICs over a period of 24 h; however, the killing rate of piperacillin was higher than that of meropenem, and bacterial regrowth was observed after the administration of meropenem. A CSF-IT value higher than 1: 32 indicates that the antibiotic concentration in the CSF exceeds the MIC for 24 h. The effect of piperacillin on BLNAR depends not only on the time above MIC of 24 h but also on the maximum concentration in the CSF.
TI  - The impact of the stone age diet on gingival conditions in the absence of oral hygiene.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to assess the oral microbiota and clinical data in subjects without access to traditional oral hygiene methods and who ate a diet available in the Stone Age. METHODS: Ten subjects living in an environment replicating the Stone Age for 4 weeks were enrolled in this study. Bleeding on probing (BOP), gingival and plaque indices, and probing depth (PD) were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. Microbiologic samples were collected at the mesio-buccal subgingival aspects of all teeth and from the dorsum of the tongue and were processed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization methods. RESULTS: No subject had periodontitis. Mean BOP decreased from 34.8% to 12.6% (P <0.001). Mean gingival index scores changed from 0.38 to 0.43 (not statistically significant) and mean plaque scores increased from 0.68 to 1.47 (P <0.001). PD at sites of subgingival sampling decreased (mean difference: 0.2 mm; P <0.001). At week 4, the total bacterial count was higher (P <0.001) for 24 of 74 species, including Bacteroides ureolyticus, Eikenella corrodens, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Staphylococcus aureus (two strains), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus anginosis, and Streptococcus mitis. Bacterial counts from tongue samples were higher at baseline (P <0.001) for 20 species, including Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; serotype a), and Streptococcus spp. CONCLUSIONS: The experimental gingivitis protocol is not applicable if the diet (e.g., Stone Age) does not include refined sugars. Although plaque levels increased, BOP and PD decreased. Subgingival bacterial counts increased for several species not linked to periodontitis, whereas tongue bacterial samples decreased during the study period.
TI  - Rapid detection of eight causative pathogens for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis by real-time PCR.
AB  - We aimed to detect causative pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected from patients diagnosed with bacterial meningitis by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae described previously, five other pathogens, Neisseria meningitidis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes, were targeted, based on a large-scale surveillance in Japan. Results in CSF from neonates and children (n=150), and from adults (n=18) analyzed by real-time PCR with molecular beacon probes were compared with those of conventional culturing. The total time from DNA extraction from CSF to PCR analysis was 1.5 h. The limit of detection for these pathogens ranged from 5 copies to 28 copies per tube. Nonspecific positive reactions were not recognized for 37 microorganisms in clinical isolates as a negative control. The pathogens were detected in 72.0% of the samples by real-time PCR, but in only 48.2% by culture, although the microorganisms were completely concordant. With the real-time PCR, the detection rate of H. influenzae from CSF was high, at 45.2%, followed by S. pneumoniae (21.4%), S. agalactiae (2.4%), E. coli (1.8%), L. monocytogenes (0.6%), and M. pneumoniae (0.6%). The detection rate with PCR was significantly better than that with cultures in patients with antibiotic administration (chi2=18.3182; P=0.0000). In conclusion, detection with real-time PCR is useful for rapidly identifying the causative pathogens of meningitis and for examining the clinical course of chemotherapy.
TI  - [Epidemiology of acute bacterial meningitis in adult patients in France].
AB  - In 2006, the number of bacterial meningitis cases was estimated at 1375 (2.23/100,000). The leading pathogens involved in adult meningitis were, according to frequency, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Haemophilus influenzae. The overall mortality rate averaged 20%, higher among patients with pneumococcal meningitis or in individuals over 65 years of age. Sequels were observed in 30% of cases and more frequent after pneumococcal meningitis. A decrease in susceptibility to antibiotics was reported for N. meningitidis, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. Generalized vaccination of children less than two years of age with H. influenzae type b conjugate vaccine has lead to a dramatic decrease in adult H. influenza meningitis. The few cases involved almost exclusively non-typeable strains, presenting in 12% of cases, a modified penicillin binding protein leading to a decreased susceptibility to aminopenicillins. Decreased susceptibility to amoxicillin was observed in 30% of meningococcal isolates, but all strains remained susceptible to parenteral third generation cephalosporins. Resistances to rifampicin or to ciprofloxacin, recommended in meningococcal meningitis prophylaxis, were unusual, but had to be documented. Finally, the proportion of pneumococcal strains with decreased susceptibility to beta-lactams has decreased since 2002. In adult meningitis, pneumococcal isolates with decreased susceptibility to penicillin, amoxicillin, and cefotaxime or ceftriaxone accounted for 37, 18, and 4% of cases respectively. It should be noted that for these isolates, no parenteral third generation cephalosporins MIC was above 2mg/l. Resistance to rifampin was very unusual and all pneumococcal isolates were fully susceptible to glycopeptides.
TI  - Secular trends in pediatric bloodstream infections over a 20-year period at a tertiary care hospital in Germany.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Over the last 20 years, a number of medical innovations with impact on the incidence of bacterial and fungal bloodstream infections (BSIs) in children have been developed and implemented. Although appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy is a prerequisite to the successful treatment of BSIs, to date, epidemiological data on long-term microbiological trends in BSIs of hospitalized children have not been available. METHODS: Two cohorts of pediatric patients who were hospitalized in a single-center tertiary care hospital in Germany over a 20-year time span (period A from 1985 to 1995 vs. period B from 1997 to 2006) were retrospectively analyzed and compared with respect to the epidemiology and microbiology of BSIs. RESULTS: A total of 1,646 cases of monomicrobial BSIs were detected. The rate of positive blood culture results dropped from 4.5% in period A to 2.0% in period B. The proportion of gram-positive vs. gram-negative pathogens recovered from blood cultures remained stable. Among gram-positive pathogens, an increase in enterococci (3.3% vs. 8.2%) and in coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (22.9 vs. 28.2%) was observed. In contrast, BSIs caused by Staphylococcus aureus (16.4% vs. 11.7%), Streptococcus agalactiae (4.9% vs. 2.1%), Haemophilus influenzae (7.3% vs. 0.7%), and Neisseria meningitidis (1.9% vs. 0.5%) diminished. In analyzing subgroups, an increase of enterococcal and CoNS infections was noted among patients with immunosuppression and neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS), while a decrease was found among late-onset sepsis (LOS) cases with S. viridans. Notably, aminopenicillin-resistant enterococci and aminopenicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant Enterobacteriaceae all increased over time, while the overall resistance pattern was still favorable. The overall mortality rate of BSIs decreased (5.2% vs. 2.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Over the 20-year study period, the spectrum of specific microorganisms among BSIs shifted, with opportunistic pathogens becoming predominant. Despite an increase in the proportion of antibiotic-resistant organisms, however, the mortality rate decreased.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of tigecycline against aerobic and facultative isolates recovered from hospitalized patients: an Argentinean multicenter study.
AB  - Tigecycline, the 9-t-butylglycylamino derivative of minocycline is the first commercially available glycylcycline exhibiting an extended spectrum of antibacterial activity due to its capacity to evade the tetracycline ribosomal and efflux resistance mechanisms. We conducted a collaborative in vitro study determining the activity of tigecycline compared to 14 antimicrobials against clinically relevant isolates obtained from adult patients hospitalized in 9 Argentinean institutions. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the reference broth microdilution method. The number of isolates and MICs 50/90 (mg/L) for tigecycline were the following: Acinetobacter spp. 132 (0.5/1); Escherichia coli 220 (0.12/0.25); Klebsiella spp. 220 (0.5/1), Enterobacter spp. 205 (0.5/1); Serratia spp. 84 (0.5/2); Haemophilus influenzae 96 (0.25/0.5); Staphylococcus aureus 223 (0.12/0.25); Streptococcus pneumoniae 98 (<or= 0.25/1); S. agalactiae 51 (0.5/0.5); Enterococcus spp. 104 (0.06/0.12); Pseudomonas aeruginosa 169 (8/16). We conclude that tigecycline is a promising drug for the treatment of infections in hospitalized patients in Argentina.
TI  - Tigecycline in vitro activity against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens collected in Italy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this study (part of the global TEST program), the in vitro activity of tigecycline, a member of a new class of antimicrobial agents, the glycylcyclines, against clinical isolates collected in Italy was evaluated. METHODS: A total of 200 clinical isolates were collected and identified in our institution during 2005. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the antimicrobial agents were determined by the broth microdilution method recommended by the CLSI in 2005. RESULTS: Globally, 135 Gram-negative and 65 Gram-positive pathogens were evaluated. Tigecycline demonstrated excellent inhibitory activity against Acinetobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae with MIC(90) <or=1 mg/l. CONCLUSION: Tigecycline exhibited potent in vitro antibacterial activity (comparable to or greater than most commonly employed antimicrobials) against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinical pathogens. These data suggest that tigecycline, with an expanded broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, may be an effective empiric therapeutic option for the treatment of serious infections caused by clinically relevant pathogens.
TI  - Effect of eucalyptus essential oil on respiratory bacteria and viruses.
AB  - The activity of Eucalyptus globulus essential oil was determined for 120 isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes, 20 isolates of S. pneumoniae, 40 isolates of S. agalactiae, 20 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, 40 isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, 30 isolates of H. parainfluenzae, 10 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 10 isolates of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and two viruses, a strain of adenovirus and a strain of mumps virus, all obtained from clinical specimens of patients with respiratory tract infections. The cytotoxicity was evaluated on VERO cells by the MTT test. The antibacterial activity was evaluated by the Kirby Bauer paper method, minimum inhibitory concentration, and minimum bactericidal concentration. H. influenzae, parainfluenzae, and S. maltophilia were the most susceptible, followed by S. pneumoniae. The antiviral activity, assessed by means of virus yield experiments titered by the end-point dilution method for adenovirus, and by plaque reduction assay for mumps virus, disclosed only a mild activity on mumps virus.
TI  - Comparative genomic analyses of seventeen Streptococcus pneumoniae strains: insights into the pneumococcal supragenome.
AB  - The distributed-genome hypothesis (DGH) states that pathogenic bacteria possess a supragenome that is much larger than the genome of any single bacterium and that these pathogens utilize genetic recombination and a large, noncore set of genes as a means of diversity generation. We sequenced the genomes of eight nasopharyngeal strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from pediatric patients with upper respiratory symptoms and performed quantitative genomic analyses among these and nine publicly available pneumococcal strains. Coding sequences from all strains were grouped into 3,170 orthologous gene clusters, of which 1,454 (46%) were conserved among all 17 strains. The majority of the gene clusters, 1,716 (54%), were not found in all strains. Genic differences per strain pair ranged from 35 to 629 orthologous clusters, with each strain's genome containing between 21 and 32% noncore genes. The distribution of the orthologous clusters per genome for the 17 strains was entered into the finite-supragenome model, which predicted that (i) the S. pneumoniae supragenome contains more than 5,000 orthologous clusters and (ii) 99% of the orthologous clusters ( approximately 3,000) that are represented in the S. pneumoniae population at frequencies of >or=0.1 can be identified if 33 representative genomes are sequenced. These extensive genic diversity data support the DGH and provide a basis for understanding the great differences in clinical phenotype associated with various pneumococcal strains. When these findings are taken together with previous studies that demonstrated the presence of a supragenome for Streptococcus agalactiae and Haemophilus influenzae, it appears that the possession of a distributed genome is a common host interaction strategy.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - Screening of the antibacterial effects of a variety of essential oils on microorganisms responsible for respiratory infections.
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the cytotoxicity and the antibacterial effects of a variety of essential oils on major respiratory tract pathogens. The cytotoxicity of 13 essential oils was evaluated on Vero cells. The antibacterial activity was evaluated by the Kirby Bauer paper method, minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentration against Streptococcus pyogenes, agalactiae, pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolated from clinical specimens. The antibiotic sensitivity of these isolates was examined. Some oils showed inhibition of bacterial growth against most of the organisms examined. Cinnamon and thyme showed the strongest action followed by clove. The results reported in this paper indicate that thyme can be considered as a potential antimicrobial agent for the treatment of some respiratory tract infections in man.
TI  - Capsular antigens of bacteria. Capsular antigens as the basis of vaccines against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The role of bacterial capsular antigens represented in capsular polysaccharides and exoglycans in pathogenicity and virulence of bacteria is discussed in this review. Using capsular antigens for vaccines against severe diseases caused by capsular microorganisms is considered in detail. The use of conjugates of capsular polysaccharides and their fragments with proteins and peptides for vaccine as well as using liposomes as adjuvants for the capsular antigens are described. Data concerning structural elucidation of bacterial capsular antigens are given in the first part of this review.
TI  - [Use of transport medium in sputum bacterial culture examination of lower airway  infection].
AB  - Our medical institution does not have a bacterial culture facility, requiring outsourcing of bacterial culture tests. Due to the time elapsed from the time of specimen collection to culturing, the identification of causative bacteria in respiratory tract infections tends to be difficult. We therefore used transport medium for sputum bacteria examinations. Expectorated purulent or purulent-mucous sputum specimens were collected from 32 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. We divided each of the sputum specimens into the two treatment groups: transport medium (Seedswab gamma2) ndar and stad disinfection container. Paired samples prepared from each patient were sent out for bacterial culture together. The time elapsed from collection to delivery to the lab were as follows: day 0 (same day, n = 14 patients), day 1 (n = 15), day 2 (n = 2), and day 3 (n = 1). The identified causative bacteria were Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 6 patients), Haemophilus influenzae (n =5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 2), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1), and Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 1). Samples prepared by each of the two methods gave similar results. The utility of transport medium for examination of general bacteria for lower airway infection from sputum samples was not demonstrated. The rate of detection of bacteria decreased, when the transport of samples was delayed. Therefore, we need to send the sputum specimens as quickly as possible.
TI  - [Trends in pediatric bacterial meningitis in Japan (2003-2004)].
AB  - We surveyed the epidemiology of pediatric bacterial meningitis between January 2003 and December 2004 in Japan, with the following results: Bacterial meningitis cases numbered 233 (132 boys, 98 girls, and 3 unidentified), equivalent to 1.13-1.6 children of 1000 hospitalized in pediatrics per year. The age distribution for the infections was the highest under 1 year of age, decreasing with increasing age. Haemophilus influenzae was the most common pathogen, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae, group B streptococcus, and Escherichia coli. The relationship between causactive pathogens and age distribution was as follows: group B. streptococcus and E. coli were major pathogens below 4 months of age and H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were major pathogens above 4 months of age. Susceptibility tests at each facility demonstrated that 65.0% of H. influenzae isolates and 83.0% of S. pneumoniae isolates in 2004 were drug-resistant. Ampicillin and cephem antibiotics are currently effective against GBS, E. coli and Listeria so a combination of ampicillin and cephem antibiotics is used first line at many facilities for patients below 4 months of age. A combination of carbapenem which showed effective against PRSP and cephem which showed effective against H. influenzae is the first choice in childhood bacterial meningitis for patients above 4 months of age.
TI  - Characterization of the bifunctional gamma-glutamate-cysteine ligase/glutathione  synthetase (GshF) of Pasteurella multocida.
AB  - Glutamate-cysteine ligase (gamma-ECL) and glutathione synthetase (GS) are the two unrelated ligases that constitute the glutathione biosynthesis pathway in most eukaryotes, purple bacteria, and cyanobacteria. gamma-ECL is a member of the glutamine synthetase family, whereas GS enzymes group together with highly diverse carboxyl-to-amine/thiol ligases, all characterized by the so-called two-domain ATP-grasp fold. This generalized scheme toward the formation of glutathione, however, is incomplete, as functional steady-state levels of intracellular glutathione may also accumulate solely by import, as has been reported for the Pasteurellaceae member Haemophilus influenzae, as well as for certain Gram-positive enterococci and streptococci, or by the action of a bifunctional fusion protein (termed GshF), as has been reported recently for the Gram-positive firmicutes Streptococcus agalactiae and Listeria monocytogenes. Here, we show that yet another member of the Pasteurellaceae family, Pasteurella multocida, acquires glutathione both by import and GshF-driven biosynthesis. Domain architecture analysis shows that this P. multocida GshF bifunctional ligase contains an N-terminal gamma-proteobacterial gamma-ECL-like domain followed by a typical ATP-grasp domain, which most closely resembles that of cyanophycin synthetases, although it has no significant homology with known GS ligases. Recombinant P. multocida GshF overexpresses as an approximately 85-kDa protein, which, on the basis of gel-sizing chromatography, forms dimers in solution. The gamma-ECL activity of GshF is regulated by an allosteric type of glutathione feedback inhibition (K(i) = 13.6 mM). Furthermore, steady-state kinetics, on the basis of which we present a novel variant of half-of-the-sites reactivity, indicate intimate domain-domain interactions, which may explain the bifunctionality of GshF proteins.
TI  - [A study of bacterial meningitis in Hokkaido between 1999 and 2003].
AB  - We evaluated 83 children with bacterial meningitis in 67 of 81 insitutions in Hokkaido, Japan between 1999 and 2003 by questionnaire. The incidence of bacterial meningitis in children aged < 5 years and 5 < or =, < 10 years was 6.3 and 0.7 cases per 100, 000 children/year. The incidences of meningitis due to Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus agalactiae in children aged < 5 years were 3.7, 1.4 and 0.8. Median age was 13 months ranging from 0 day to 9 years. Seventy-four (89.1%) of the total were less than 5 years old with 39 (47.0%) less than 1 year old. Major causative organisms were H. influenzae in 51 patients, S. pneumoniae in 18, S. agalactiae in 9 and E. coli in 3. Four deaths occurred, giving an overall case mortality rate of 4.8%. Sequelae were seen at discharge in 25.3%, predominantly epilepsy, hearing loss, and developmental delay of varying severity. The frequency of poor prognosis was 55.6% for patients with meningitis due to S. pneumoniae compared with 21.6% for H. influenzae and 22.2% for S. agalactiae.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against 6792 Gram-negative and Gram-positive clinical isolates from the global Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST Program, 2004).
AB  - Tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antibiotic, has shown promising in vitro activity against many common pathogens, including multidrug-resistant strains. To determine the activity of tigecycline against a broad range of pathogens from diverse populations and geographic areas, the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST Program) commenced in 2003. This study evaluated the activity of tigecycline and commonly used antimicrobials against 6792 clinical isolates from 40 study centers in 11 countries. Tigecycline was the most active agent tested against Gram-positive facultative species including multidrug-resistant strains. MIC90 results (microg/mL) for tigecycline against Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.12, 0.12, 0.25, and 0.25 microg/mL, respectively. Tigecycline was active against Enterobacteriaceae with an MIC90 of 1 microg/mL. Haemophilus influenzae was very susceptible to tigecycline with an MIC90 of only 0.25 microg/mL. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the least susceptible organism tested against tigecycline. Tigecycline appears to be a promising new glycylcycline agent for the treatment of many types of pathogens with varying resistance phenotypes.
TI  - Trends in the epidemiology of neonatal sepsis of vertical transmission in the era of group B streptococcal prevention.
AB  - AIM: To assess trends in the epidemiology of culture-proven and clinical neonatal sepsis of vertical transmission in the era of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. METHODS: Since 1995, the neonatal services of 28 acute-care teaching hospitals in Spain ("Grupo de Hospitales Castrillo") have been involved in the prospective surveillance of neonatal infection of vertical transmission. We here report the comparison of the incidence for the periods 1996-1997 and 2000-2001, and look separately at two groups of hospitals according to the time at which the official hospital policy to provide intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for group B Streptococcus (GBS) prevention was adopted. In 16 hospitals the policy was adopted in 1999 and in 10 before 1998 (nine hospitals in 1996, one in 1997). RESULTS: The incidence of proven sepsis decreased significantly by 22% and 54% in the hospitals that started prophylaxis in 1999 and before 1998, respectively. The incidence of GBS sepsis also declined significantly by 36.4% and 65.4% in both groups of hospitals, respectively. Significant variations in the incidence of clinical vertical sepsis as well as in the incidence of sepsis caused by Haemophilus influenzae and Klebsiella were not found. Sepsis caused by Escherichia coli increased in the hospitals with prophylaxis from 1999 and decreased in those that began prophylaxis before 1998, in which the mortality rate of proven and clinical sepsis also decreased significantly by 58.6%. CONCLUSIONS: There was a substantial decline in the incidence of proven vertical sepsis, with a significant reduction of GBS sepsis, although decreases were more marked when antibiotic prophylaxis was started before 1998. In this group of hospitals, there was also a decrease in the mortality rate. Fluctuations in the incidence of E. coli infection suggest the need for continuing epidemiological surveillance.
TI  - Rapid diagnosis of bacterial meningitis by real-time PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization.
AB  - Real-time PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were evaluated as rapid methods for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis and compared to standard diagnostic procedures. For PCR, a LightCycler approach was chosen, implementing eubacterial and specific PCR assays for the most relevant bacteria. For FISH, a similar probe set containing eubacterial and specific probes was composed of published and newly designed probes. Both methods were evaluated by use of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with suspected bacterial meningitis. For all microscopy- and culture-positive samples (n = 28), the eubacterial PCR was positive. In addition, all identifiable pathogens were detected with specific PCR assays, according to an algorithm based on the Gram stain. The FISH method detected the pathogen in 13 of 18 positive samples. While the FISH method remained negative for all microscopy- and culture-negative samples (n = 113), the eubacterial PCR was positive for five of these samples. Sequencing of the amplicon revealed the presence of Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Haemophilus influenzae in three of these five samples. In addition, samples with discordant results by culture and microscopy were successfully investigated by PCR (10 samples) and FISH (5 samples). In conclusion, PCR is a highly sensitive tool for rapid diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. FISH is less sensitive but is useful for the identification of CSF samples showing bacteria in the Gram stain. Based on our results, an approach for laboratory diagnosis of meningitis including PCR and FISH is discussed.
TI  - Fluoroquinolone-resistant Streptococcus agalactiae: epidemiology and mechanism of resistance.
AB  - Quinolone-resistant Streptococcus agalactiae bacteria were recovered from single-patient isolates and found to contain mutations in the gyrase and topoisomerase IV genes. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis demonstrated that four isolates from the same long-term care facility were closely related; in seven cases, quinolone-resistant Haemophilus influenzae and S. agalactiae bacteria were isolated from the same patient.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of oral cephems against various clinically isolated strains and evaluation of efficacy based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics theory].
AB  - We compared the antimicrobial activity of commercially available oral cephem agents, cefaclor (CCL), cefroxadine (CXD), cefdinir (CFDN), cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX), cefteram (CFTM), cefcapene (CFPN), and cefditoren (CDTR), against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and ESBL-producing bacteria isolated from clinical materials in Kansai Medical University Hospital between 2002 and 2003. Based on the Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) theory, we determined the concentration of each agent at which the time above MIC (TAM) value was 40% or more, and calculated the rate of efficacy against each type of bacteria. In S. pneumoniae strains, the MIC(50,80,90) values of CDTR were 0.25, 0.5, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, lower than those of the other agents, demonstrating the most potent antimicrobial activity. However, the efficacy rate for CDTR calculated based on the PK/PD theory was 58.5%. CFTM showed the highest efficacy rate (66.1%). In H. influenzae strains, the antimicrobial activity of CDTR was most potent, followed by that of CFTM and that of CFPN/CFIX. The MIC90 value of CDTR was lowest (0.25 microg/ml), followed by that of CFTM (0.5 microg/ml). The efficacy rate for CDTR was 100%. This result supports that CDTR frequently eradicates H. influenzae. In E. coli strains, the MIC90 values of the above agents, excluding CCL and CXD, ranged from 0.5 to 1 microg/ml. The antimicrobial activity of CFIX against K. pneumoniae was most potent, followed by that of CFDN/CPDX and that of CFTM. In ESBL-producing bacteria, most agents showed an MIC90 value of more than 4 microg/ml. In S. agalactiae and S. pyogenes strains, all of the agents showed satisfactory MIC values. In methi- cillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) strains, CFDN and CXD showed a high efficacy rate, whereas the efficacy rates for the other agents were low. The frequent use of oral agents has increased the number of cephem-resistant bacteria. ESBL-producing bacteria become highly resistant, and the presence or absence of response can be readily evaluated. However, when a mutation of penicillin-binding protein (PBP) occurs, drug resistance is less marked. Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate the treatment response in many cases. In S. pneumoniae strains, the efficacy rates for all of the agents were low in the evaluation using the PK/PD theory, suggesting that a dose higher than the standard dose should be established. Thus, in the future, the efficacy should be evaluated based on the PK/PD theory, appropriate antimicrobial treatment should be administered, and the administration method that does not increase the number of resistant bacteria must be established.
TI  - [Rapid diagnosis of neonatal sepsis by 16SrRNA genes PCR amplification and genechip hybridization].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore a method for rapid diagnosis of sepsis in newborn infants.  METHODS: (1) The primers and oligonucleotide probes were designed and synthesized based on the sequences of bacterial 16SrRNA gene. The gene chip was prepared through the probes printed onto special glass slides. The gene chip included 18 special probes: universal probe 1, universal probe 2, Gram positive bacterial probe, Gram negative bacterial probe 1, Gram negative bacterial probe 2, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (CoNS) 1, CoNS 2, Escherichia coli, Hemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus, Meningococcus, Corynebacterium, Propionibacterium; (2) Blood specimens from 285 cases of suspected septicemia were cultured and bacterial 16S rRNA gene was detected separately; DNA isolated from blood specimens and cerebrospinal fluid was amplified by PCR, and PCR products were hybridized with the probes on the gene chips. Hybridization results were scanned and read by laser-scanner. RESULTS: (1) Of the 285 cases, 17 were positive by PCR and the positive rate (5.96%) was significantly higher than that of blood culture (2.81%) (P < 0.01). When blood culture was taken as control, the sensitivity of PCR was 100% and Specificity was 96.75%, the index of accurate diagnosis was 0.968. (2) The 17 specimens which showed positive results by PCR were further hybridized on the gene chip. All were positive by universal probes. Among all of them, 5 were positive by E. coli probe; 4 were positive by Staphylococcus epidermidis; two were positive by Bacillus and Propionibacterium probes, separately; 4 were positive by CoNS. The 8 specimens which showed positive results by both PCR and blood culture, the result of gene chip hybridization coincided with the result of blood culture. CONCLUSION: Detection of the bacterial 16SrRNA genes in clinical specimens by gene chip hybridization technology can diagnose neonatal septicemia rapidly. This method has higher sensitivity and specificity than blood culture or other methods and can provide a rapid way for the etiological diagnosis of neonatal septicemia. Therefore the genechip method may be valuable and practical in early diagnosis of neonatal septicemia.
TI  - Incidence of Haemophilus influenzae type b and other invasive diseases in South Korean children.
AB  - To determine incidence of invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) disease in a defined population of Jeonbuk Province, Korea, children <5 years were evaluated in prospective, population-based surveillance of invasive bacterial diseases using standardized methods for patient referral, clinical evaluation and laboratory testing (optimized culture, latex agglutination, polymerase chain reaction). Vaccine utilization was assessed with vaccination histories of patients in surveillance, monthly data on Hib vaccine distribution and a coverage survey of clinic patients in study population. From September 1999 to December 2001, 2176 children were evaluated for possible meningitis, 1541 had no cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings of meningitis, 605 had CSF abnormalities (suspected bacterial meningitis) but no pathogen identified; six patients had probable Hib meningitis and eight had confirmed Hib meningitis. The annual suspected bacterial meningitis incidence was 258.4/100,000 <5 years and the probable/confirmed Hib meningitis incidence was 6.0/100,000 <5 years. Pneumococcal meningitis incidence was 2.1/100,000 <5 years and Group B streptococcal meningitis incidence was 0.17/1000 live births. A total of 69,589 Hib vaccine doses were distributed during the study. Hib vaccine coverage was negligible initially but increased to 16% (complete Hib immunization) and 27% (partial immunization) in final months of study. Suspected bacterial meningitis incidence was high but proven invasive Hib meningitis incidence was low. Hib was leading cause of bacterial meningitis yet bacterial pathogens were identified in only 4% of abnormal CSF. These findings may reflect truly low incidence, presumptive antibiotic treatment, partial Hib immunization, or incomplete clinical evaluations. Given the apparent Hib meningitis burden in Jeonbuk Province, additional studies to describe other invasive Hib syndromes, Hib-associated mortality and disability, and economic impact of Hib disease will be useful to guide public health decisions regarding routine Hib vaccine introduction.
TI  - Seasonal evaluation of antigenic bacterial infections among working class in the  inner city of Houston.
AB  - This paper evaluates the monthly, quarterly, and seasonal variation of antigenic  bacterial infections among the working class in the inner city of Houston using the Wellcogen Rapid Test methods. One of the aims was to demonstrate how this method could be used effectively in screening patients at risk and preventing the spread of antigenic bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae b, Streptococcus (Strep b), and Neisseria meningitidis (mainly group c and b). A total of 2,837 patients were screened for bacterial infections; 908 (32%) were male and 1,929 (68%) were female. The age range was between 2 and 70 years. Of the total group, 356 (12.5%) patients were positive; 203 (57%) were female while 153 (43%) were male (male/female ratio of 1:1.3). Medically underserved and immune suppressed populations are the most affected by these bacterial infections. Blacks are the most affected (48%) compared to Native Americans (1%), but children under 10 years of age have the highest incidence. This research showed, in addition, that the Wellcogen Rapid Tests are effective (356 cases identified) for a rapid screening of infectious bacteria. Explanation for these results was probably due to poor living conditions, poor hygiene, and viral immune suppression in adults and immature immune systems in neonates and children under 10 years of age.
TI  - [Epidemiology of bacterial meningitis in France in 2002].
AB  - In France, two sources of data, the mandatory notification and the hospital laboratory network EPIBAC, allow the health authorities to monitor the incidence of bacterial meningitis. In 2002 around 1,500 cases were estimated in France. The more common microorganisms were: Streptococcus pneumoniae 49% (incidence 1.19/100,000), Neisseria meningitidis 33% (incidence 0.83) and Streptococcus agalactiae (Streptococcus B) 11% (incidence 0.27). Listeria monocytogenes accounted for 4% of the cases (incidence 0.11) and Haemophilus influenzae accounted for 3% (incidence 0.08). Trends in incidence showed an increase of meningococci meningitis since 1996, a steady decrease of H. influenzae and Listeria meningitis since 1992, and a quasi stable number of pneumococci meningitis, streptococci B meningitis and tuberculosis meningitis in the last 10 years. The impact of preventive measures on the incidence of Listeria meningitis and H. influenzae b meningitis has been clearly demonstrated through the dramatic decrease of meningitis due to these microorganisms.
TI  - Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry for glycoscreening in biomedical research.
AB  - Application of capillary electrophoresis (CE) in combination with mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem MS to glycoscreening in biomedical projects is highlighted. In the first part recent CE-MS experiments by sheath liquid CE and multiple stage MS are reported. Neutral and negatively charged N-glycan mixtures from ribonuclease B and fetuin, high-mannose type N-glycoforms, oligosaccharides from lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of Haemophilus influenzae, polysaccharides of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were analyzed. A particular emphasis is devoted to the applicability of novel off- and on-line CE-MS and tandem MS methods for screening of proteoglycan-derived oligosaccharides, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as hyaluronates from Streptococcus agalactiae, chondroitin/dermatan sulfates (CS/DS) from bovine aorta and human skin fibroblast decorin, and heparin/heparan sulfate (HS) from porcine and bovine mucosa. The performance of CE-MS/MS for identification of glycoforms in glycopeptides and glycoproteins is illustrated by experiments performed on complex mixtures from urine of patients suffering from a hereditary N-acetylhexosaminidase deficiency (Schindler's disease) and urine of patients suffering from cancer cachexia. For determination of glycosylation patterns in glycoproteins like enzymes and antibodies by CE/MS, both CE-matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and CE-electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS were functional. Finally, the potential of CE-ESI-MS strategy in glycolipid analysis is demonstrated for gangliosides from bovine brain for which particular CE buffer conditions are required.
TI  - Increased S100B in cerebrospinal fluid of infants with bacterial meningitis: relationship to brain damage and routine cerebrospinal fluid findings.
AB  
TI  - [Clinical study of 28 children with bacterial meningitis].
AB  - A retrospective study was conducted on 28 patients with bacterial meningitis who  were admitted to our department between April 1988 and March 2002. The most commonly detected pathogen was group B Streptococcus in those under 1 month of age and Haemophilus influenzae (72.2%) among those over 1 month. The most commonly administered antibiotic combination (67.9%) at the initial treatment was that of cefotaxime (CTX) and ampicillin (ABPC). We encountered one case that was resistant to both CTX and ABPC. Through this experience, it became apparent that for the initial treatment of bacterial meningitis in infants, it is necessary to apply a combination of two antibiotics, instead of a single agent, and new antibiotics should be considered for such combinations rather than persisting on conventional CTX and ABPC. The aforementioned 28 patients were divided into 2 groups--7 patients (25.0%) with sequelae and 21 (75.0%) without--and various factors noted during the diagnosis were evaluated retrospectively. It was found that the number of days leading to admission at the hospital and the development of convulsions were unrelated to the prognosis. Those who succumbed or suffered sequelae were all infants under 1 year of age. All cases were caused by genus Haemophilus.
TI  - Algorithm for the identification of bacterial pathogens in positive blood cultures by real-time LightCycler polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with sequence-specific probes.
AB  - We developed real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for rapid detection of the most common and clinically relevant bacteria in positive blood culture bottles, including Staphylococcus spp., S. epidermidis, S. aureus, Enterococcus spp. (including differentiation of E. faecalis and E. faecium), Streptococcus spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter spp., Bacteroides spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. A total of 507 positive blood cultures were investigated according to a specific PCR algorithm based on the microscopic result of the blood culture, and the PCR results were compared to the culture results. Apart from-cross reactions between E. coli and Chryseomonas luteola and Enterococcus faecium and E. durans, the PCR assay correctly identified all bacteria in the blood cultures and did not show any false-positive results. Regarding blood cultures positive with a single species of bacteria (n = 474), 98.3% of all bacteria were correctly detected by the PCR algorithm within a few hours. However, in mixed infections, the sensitivity was lower. The PCR algorithm is well suited for rapid identification of the most common bacteria in positive blood cultures.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from central nervous  system specimens as reported by U.S. hospital laboratories from 2000 to 2002.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial infections of the central nervous system, especially acute  infections such as bacterial meningitis require immediate, invariably empiric antibiotic therapy. The widespread emergence of resistance among bacterial species is a cause for concern. Current antibacterial susceptibility data among central nervous system (CNS) pathogens is important to define current prevalence of resistance. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from CNS specimens was analyzed using The Surveillance Database (TSN) USA Database which gathers routine antibiotic susceptibility data from >300 US hospital laboratories. A total of 6029 organisms derived from CNS specimen sources during 2000-2002, were isolated and susceptibility tested. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus (23.7%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (11.0%) were the most common gram-positive pathogens. Gram-negative species comprised approximately 25% of isolates. The modal patient age was 1 or <1 year for most organisms. Prevalence of MRSA among S. aureus from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain abscesses were 29.9-32.9%. Penicillin resistance rates were 16.6% for S. pneumoniae, 5.3% for viridans group streptococci, and 0% for S. agalactiae. For CSF isolates, ceftriaxone resistance was S. pneumoniae (3.5%), E. coli (0.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2.8%), Serratia marcescens (5.6%), Enterobacter cloacae (25.0%), Haemophilus influenzae (0%). Listeria monocytogenes and N. meningitidis are not routinely susceptibility tested. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance is commonly detected, albeit still at relatively low levels for key drugs classes such as third-generation cephalosporins. This data demonstrates the need to consider predominant resistance phenotypes when choosing empiric therapies to treat CNS infections.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in infants: the epidemiology, clinical features, and prognostic factors.
AB  - This 16-year (1986-2001) retrospective study enrolled 80 infantile patients (aged, 30-365 days old) with culture-proven bacterial meningitis. The most prevalent pathogens were Salmonellaspecies, Streptococcus (S.) agalactiae, Escherichia (E.) coli, and Haemophilus (H.) influenzae, accounting for about 59% of the episodes. Meningitis caused by Salmonella species, E. coli and H. influenzae occurs more often in the older infants, while that caused by S. agalactiae occurs more often in young infants. Our study revealed a decrease in the proportion of Salmonella meningitis from 27% in the first 8 years to 9% in the second 8 years with E. coli replacing Salmonella species as the leading pathogen of this disease during the second period. Overall mortality rate for both periods of time was 11%. However, if we take those with undesirable poor outcomes into account, 43% of patients could be considered treatment failures. The study also reveals a high prevalence of neurological complications when this disease is caused by H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and Salmonella species. Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that only initial changing levels of consciousness (P = 0.006) were independently associated with treatment failure. The most frequent neurological complications associated with this disease included subdural empyema, hydrocephalus, cerebral infarctions, and seizures. Because therapeutic regimens may require attention to the eradication of bacterial pathogen but also the neurological complications, early diagnosis and choice of appropriate antibiotics are essential to increasing the possibility of survival.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of the peptide deformylase inhibitor BB-83698.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: BB-83698 is a peptide deformylase inhibitor currently in clinical trials in Europe. The purpose of this study was to provide additional susceptibility data from clinical isolates, including drug-resistant strains. METHODS: The in vitro activities of BB-83698 and comparators were determined against 281 streptococci, 154 Staphylococcus aureus, 110 Haemophilus influenzae and 50 Moraxella catarrhalis strains selected for their resistance phenotypes. Broth microdilution MICs and MBCs were determined according to NCCLS guidelines. RESULTS: The MIC90s were 0.25-0.5 mg/L for S. pneumoniae, including penicillin-, erythromycin-, levofloxacin- and multidrug-resistant strains. The MIC90s for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.12 mg/L and for viridans streptococci, the MIC90 was 0.5 mg/L. Against S. aureus, including oxacillin- and levofloxacin-resistant strains, and vancomycin-intermediate strains, the MIC90 was 8 mg/L. Against beta-lactamase-negative and -positive H. influenzae, the MIC90s were 32 and 64 mg/L, respectively, and against both beta-lactamase-negative and -positive M. catarrhalis the MIC90 was 0.12 mg/L. In MBC studies, the ratio of MBC/MIC was 1:1 or 2:1 against 31% of S. pneumoniae, 33% of S. aureus, 63% of H. influenzae and 9% of M. catarrhalis. CONCLUSIONS: Although BB-83698 has reduced in vitro activity against H. influenzae, it is a potent antimicrobial with excellent activity against streptococci and Moraxella.
TI  - In vitro activity of ABT773, a new ketolide derivative exhibiting innovative microbiological properties against well-characterised antibiotic resistant pathogens in Italy.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ABT773, a new ketolide, was assessed against a collection (518) of well-characterised Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens and compared with that of other appropriate drugs. ABT773 was active (MIC-90=0.03 mg/l) against the staphylococci tested which included macrolide-resistant but clindamycin susceptible organisms. Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae were also inhibited (MIC-90 range: <0.0075-0.5mg/l) irrespective of their antibiotic resistance phenotype. Enterococcus faecalis was sensitive to ABT773 with the exception of VanA mutants. E. faecium showed poor susceptibility to ABT773. The activity of the new ketolide against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis was comparable with that of the most potent drugs tested. ABT773 displays the characteristics of a promising agent that deserves to be introduced as the empirical therapy of infections caused by the bacterial species tested here, even if they are multiply resistant.
TI  - Bacterial polysaccharides as vaccines--immunity and chemical characterization.
AB  - Studies on protective immunity and biochemical characterization of bacterial capsular polysaccharides have led to significant contributions to understanding of the mechanisms of infectious diseases and development of effective vaccines. Immunity to encapsulated bacteria is related to antibody response to polysaccharide (PS) antigen, interactions with T- and B-lymphocytes, and host defense mechanisms. Meningococcal, pneumococcal and Salmonella vi PSs and Haemophilus type b PS-protein conjugate vaccines have been licensed and provided effective immunity for prevention of these bacterial infections. Capsular PSs are cell-surface polymers consisting of oligosaccharide repeating units. Many PSs are highly polar and hydrophilic and interfere with cell-to-cell interactions with phagocytes. Most pneumococcal PSs are negatively charged and possess acidic components such as D-glucuronic acid and phosphate in phosphodiester bonds. Extensive immunologic cross-reactivity has been observed among bacterial capsular PSs. In infants the antibody responses to most capsular PSs are generally poor. Enhanced immunogenicity of PS antigens can be achieved through PS-protein conjugate vaccines, immunization during a critical period of perinatal development and effective antigen delivery system.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of macrolides against recent clinical isolates, and analysis of resistant mechanisms].
AB  - We examined antibacterial activities of 4 kinds of macrolides, erythromycin (EM), clarithromycin (CAM), azithromycin (AZM) and rokitamycin (RKM), against 6 bacterial species of clinical strains isoleted in 2002. Bacterial isolates used were each 50 strains of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and 43 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. S. agalactiae were derived from gynecological samples, and other species were isolated from respiratory specimens. Antimicrobial activities against S. aureus, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae of 14-membered macrolides, such as EM and CAM, were higher than those of 16-membered macrolide, RKM. By contrast, against S. pneumoniae, RKM was more effective than 14-membered macrolides. Six, three and four strains of S. aureus, S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae, respectively, were resistant to macrolides. Thirty-five among 43 pneumococcal isolates were resistant, and 15 of the 35 were highly-resistant, MIC of > 128 micrograms/ml, to any one of EM, CAM or AZM. Isolation frequency of resistant strains to RKM was lower than those to 14- and 15-membered macrolides: only one strain was highly-resistant and 12 were intermediately-resistant. No resistant strain was recognized in M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae. Further, we analyzed the resistant mechanisms, methylation or efflux, of macrolide resistant strains by the double-disk method. Methylation was major mechanism in S. aureus, and in S. pyogenes, all of the resistance was caused by methylation. In S. agalactiae and S. pneumoniae, methylation and efflux shared about half and half.
TI  - Comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent North American clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the US and Canada between 1997 and 1999. Based upon Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many Gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. Against Enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general, displayed weak activity with only Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of Gram-negative non-Enterobacteriaceae including Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against Burkholderia cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.
TI  - Group B streptococcal conjugate vaccines.
AB  - Linkage of bacterial capsular polysaccharides to proteins to create conjugate vaccines has had a dramatic impact on the health of children. Although unconjugated polysaccharides are poorly immunogenic in infants and some older children and adults, their covalent coupling with proteins stimulates T cell dependent antigenic recognition that profoundly enhances immunogenicity. In the decade since the introduction and widespread use of Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide conjugate vaccines in the United States, invasive H influenzae infections have become a rarity in childhood. Similarly, the conjugation of polysaccharides of Streptococcus pneumoniae to a derivative of diphtheria toxoid and the addition of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to infant immunisation schedules carries with it promise for a similar decline in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in paediatric patients.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime against clinical isolates in 2000 and 2001].
AB  - As the post-marketing surveillance of cefpodoxime proxetil (Banan), MICs of cefpodoxime (CPDX, an active form of Banan) against 1090 clinical isolates of 22 species from 15 medical institutions all over Japan from June 2000 to March 2001 were measured using the broth microdilution method approved by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and compared with those of oral cephem antibacterials, cefaclor, cefdinir, cefditoren, and cefcapene. In this study, remarkable change in the activity of CPDX was observed in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae compared with the susceptibility in the studies before Banan was launched. This cause is considered to be the increase in the incidence of the following resistant strains: penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (47.3%), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP, 15.1%), and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) H. influenzae (24.0%), which were scarcely isolated in 1989 when Banan was launched. Other tested drugs also exhibited low activity against these resistant strains. However, CPDX showed comparatively good activity with MIC90 of 2 micrograms/mL against PRSP. Against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, CPDX also showed comparatively good activity with MIC90 of < or = 4 micrograms/mL, which was almost equal to that in the studies before its marketing. Against quinolones-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, CPDX showed excellent activity with MIC90 of 0.5 microgram/mL. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae except for Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii, CPDX showed good activity. However, in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. Proteus spp., and Providencia spp., there are some high-resistant strains to all tested drugs including CPDX. Against Peptostreptococcus spp., MIC90 of CPDX was 8 micrograms/mL and its MIC range was widely distributed from 0.03 to 32 micrograms/mL, which were similar to those in the studies before its marketing. In this study, CPDX showed the decrease in the activity against several species as did other drugs tested, but against most of species tested, CPDX maintained good activity. Furthermore, it is necessary to pay much attention to the trend of resistant strains.
TI  - In vitro activity of ertapenem against common clinical isolates in relation to human pharmacokinetics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ertapenem against bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with moderate to severe complicated intra-abdominal, complicated skin/skin structure, acute pelvic, or complicated urinary tract infection or community acquired pneumonia was compared to ceftriaxone and piperacillin-tazobactam and related to known plasma concentrations of the three agents. Ertapenem was more potent against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) than ceftriaxone and piperacillin-tazobactam and was more potent and more active than both of these agents against Enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes. Piperacillin-tazobactam was the most active agent against enterococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (n=1088), Streptococcus pyogenes (n=37), Streptococcus agalactiae (n=48), MSSA (n=187), Haemophilus influenzae (n=59), and Moraxella catarrhalis (n=9) were susceptible to ertapenem; < 1% of 1284 anaerobes and only 1 of 113 Streptococcus pneumoniae (a penicillin-resistant isolate) were resistant to ertapenem. The MIC value at which 90% of all Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci, MSSA, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and anaerobes were inhibited (MIC90) was < or = 1 microg/ml and below the mean plasma concentration of total ertapenem following a 1 g intravenous infusion for at least 24 hours, i.e., the entire recommended dosing interval, and below the free drug concentration for at least 8 h.
TI  - [Epidemiology of bacterial meningitis in France in 1999].
AB  - In France, two sources of data, the mandatory notification and the laboratory network EPIBAC, allow the health authorities to follow the incidence of bacterial meningitis (BM) and to assess the relative frequency of the micro-organisms responsible for such infection. In 1999, more than 1,000 cases of BM were notified in France. The more common micro-organisms were: Streptococcus pneumoniae 46%, Neisseria meningitidis 32% and Streptococcus agalactiae(or Streptococcus B) 11%. Listeria monocytogenes and Haemophilus influenzae accounted for 6% and 5% of the cases respectively. In 1999, the incidence per 100,000 inhabitants of meningitis due to pneumococci (0.81), to streptococci B (0.19) and tuberculosis meningitis (0.17) were stable since 1995. The incidence rate of meningitis due to Listeria (0.10) and to H. influenzae (0.08) shows a regular decrease since 1992. The impact of preventive measures of meningitis due to Listeria and H. influenzae B has been clearly demonstrated through the dramatic decrease of meningitis due to these micro-organisms.
TI  - The changing epidemiology of bacterial meningitis and invasive non-meningitic bacterial disease in scotland during the period 1983-99.
AB  - We reviewed population-based laboratory reports of invasive meningococcal, pneumococcal, Haemophilus influenzae, Group B Streptococcus (GBS) and Listeria monocytogenes isolates in order to examine the changing epidemiology of meningitis and invasive non-meningitic disease (INMD) caused by these 5 pathogens in the 2 periods before (1983-91) and after (1992-99) routine use of H. influenzae type B conjugate vaccine (Hib) in Scotland. Neissieria meningitidis was the most common cause of meningitis, accounting for 39.2% of cases of meningitis in 1983-91 and 47% of cases in 1992-99, followed by H. influenzae (31%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (22.4%), GBS (3.9%) and L. monocytogenes (3.5%) in 1983-91 and S. pneumoniae (36.3%), H. influenzae (7.8%), GBS (6.1%) and L. monocytogenes (2.8%) in 1992-99. The important epidemiological features of meningitis and INMD caused by these 5 pathogens between 1983-91 and 1992-99 include: 1. The incidence of bacterial meningitis due to S. pneumoniae and GBS was stable; 2. S. pneumoniae was the predominant cause of INMD in both periods; 3. The incidences of INMD caused by N. meningitidis, GBS and S. pneumoniae increased, by 27%, 55% and 56%, respectively; 4. Decreases in the incidences of bacterial meningitis (by 50%) and INMD (by 50%) due to L. monocytogenes were detected; and 5. There were dramatic reductions in the proportions of bacterial meningitis (by 92%) and INMD (by 56%) due to H. influenzae in vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals. Continued surveillance is necessary to monitor the disease trend, population at risk, serotype distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility in order to implement appropriate public health interventions against invasive bacterial disease.
TI  - Capsulate bacteria and the lung.
AB  - Capsulate bacteria cause the majority of community-acquired pneumonia presenting  to hospital world-wide, at all ages. They are united by the virulence factor of their differing capsular polysaccharides, enabling them to evade phagocytosis. All cause invasive disease beyond the respiratory tract, including septicaemia and central nervous system infection. Recent advances in vaccine development have made the capsular polysaccharide an achievable target for vaccine strategies across all ages, with impacts already seen upon Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b pneumonia in countries able to afford these new vaccines.
TI  - [Neonatal bacterial infection by maternal-fetal contamination: for a change in approach? 2. Uncertainties and proposals].
AB  - Based on a critical analysis of the literature, it is clear that even though mortality has decreased to 10-15%, the prevalence of neonatal bacterial infections remains dramatically stable. Precise risk factors can be identified in most cases of neonatal infection, but remain uncertain in many others: Streptococcus agalactiae is found in only 40% of the cases of sepsis; Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Pneumococcus, and group A Streptococcus strains should also be considered for a real prophylactic strategy; context (prematurity), lack of a consensual attitude for intrapartum strategies; management schemes for asymptomatic neonates. Based on these observations, we make proposals for a realistic attitude for everyday practice based on risk factors, maternal and neonatal bacterial sampling procedures, and modalities for neonatal antibiotic therapy.
TI  - In vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against selected bacterial pathogens isolated in Italy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin, against 732 clinical strains recently isolated in Italy. METHODS: Susceptibility tests were performed according to NCCLS-guided MIC methodology. Pathogens included in the evaluation included 108 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 124 coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates, 158 Streptococcus pyogenes isolates, 30 Streptococcus agalactiae isolates, 30 b-hemolytic streptococcal isolates, 18 Streptococcus sanguis isolates, 80 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 69 Enterococcal isolates, 40 Haemophilus influenzae isolates, 30 Moraxella catarrhalis isolates and, finally, 30 Gram-positive and 25 Gram-negative anaerobes. RESULTS: Quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibited Staphylococcus aureus and other Staphylococcus spp., irrespective of their oxacillin or erythromycin resistance phenotypes. Similarly, streptococci were fully inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin. Enterococcus faecalis was not included in the spectrum of this streptogramin, while isolates of Enterococcus faecium were inhibited by the new compound. Respiratory pathogens such as H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin as well as all Gram-negative anaerobes tested. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a putative role for quinupristin/dalfopristin in the empirical treatment of severe nosocomial and community-acquired infections caused by pathogens often displaying resistance to multiple antibiotics. This drug may provide an alternative to glycopeptide compounds.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis: current controversies in approaches to treatment.
AB  - Acute bacterial meningitis continues to be a disease with unacceptably high mortality and morbidity rates in both adults and children worldwide, despite advances in antibacterial therapy. Death or permanent disability occurs frequently. The causative organism varies with age, immune function and immunisation status. Infection with Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) is associated with the majority of cases, with Listeria monocytogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae being more prevalent pathogens at the extremes of age (<3 months or >50 years). Antibacterial resistance is an increasing problem, particularly in pneumococcal bacteria but increasingly in other organisms. The increasing prevalence of resistance of pneumococcus to penicillin and the cephalosporins complicates therapy and may have an important impact on treatment outcome. Increased understanding of the pathophysiology has allowed advances in diagnosis and therapy. The use of adjunctive corticosteroids remains controversial, but is probably beneficial in reducing neurological sequelae in children. In adults the evidence is less clear. Vaccination has virtually eradicated Hib meningitis in some countries. Recent introduction of a conjugate vaccine against serogroup C meningococci in the UK has caused a dramatic reduction in the incidence of invasive disease due to this organism. A 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine promises a similar reduction in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease. In the meantime, the emergence of widespread resistance of organisms to antibacterial agents, in particular among the common organisms causing bacterial meningitis, remains the biggest challenge in therapy.
TI  - Susceptibility of a variety of clinical isolates to linezolid: a European inter-country comparison.
AB  - Using standardized in vitro susceptibility tests, 3382 bacteria recently isolated from skin, blood or respiratory tract infections were analysed for their susceptibility to linezolid, a new oxazolidinone, and a number of comparator antibacterial agents. Isolates originated in France, Italy, Germany, Spain, Sweden, The Netherlands and the UK. Laboratories in each country independently conducted broth microdilution susceptibility tests using NCCLS methods and epsilonometry (Etest). Isolates of Gram-positive cocci tested in each laboratory included methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus spp. Isolates of Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae were also included. Where appropriate, comparator drugs (oxacillin, vancomycin, gentamicin, co-amoxiclav, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, penicillin G, clindamycin and ampicillin) were also tested. Linezolid demonstrated excellent activity against all of the Gram-positive cocci with MIC50s ranging from 0.5 to 4 mg/L. The drug demonstrated only modest activity against M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae with MIC50s ranging from 4 to 16 mg/L.
TI  - [Molecular mimicry of bacterial polysaccharides and their role in etiology of infectious and autoimmune diseases].
AB  - Molecular mimicry is one of the most important pathogenic factor of microorganism and is defined as a structural similarity of microbial molecules to host tissue contributing to the pathogenicity. Mimicry can be observed at the molecular, serological and functional level. In the review the infectious diseases have been discussed where the mimicry phenomenon may occur, and also autoimmune disease where due to the molecular mimicry bacterial structures are potent to induce adverse immune reactions. The cross-reacting molecules mimicking the host structures comprise colominic acid, sialic acid containing capsular polysaccharides of Streptococcus group B, phosphocholine containing antigen, lipopolysaccharides of Campylobacter jejuni contributing in induction of Guillain-Barre syndrome or Lewis antigen containing lipopolysaccharides of Helicobacter pylori inducing gut carcinoma. Knowledge on the phenomenon of molecular mimicry is important when new conjugate vaccine has to be constructed, because great care should be paid not to induce autoantibodies with synthetic immunogen. Investigation of microbial factors reveal that many autoimmune diseases are of infection etiology.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid and 11 other antimicrobials against 566 clinical isolates and comparison between NCCLS microdilution and Etest methods.
AB  - The in vitro activity of linezolid and 11 other antimicrobials was determined for 566 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, some of them resistant to several antibiotics, using a broth microdilution method and the Etest method. All Gram-positive organisms tested were inhibited by a concentration of <or=4 mg/L of linezolid, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin- and ampicillin-resistant enterococci, and penicillin-intermediate and -resistant pneumococci. MICs of linezolid by the Etest method were usually one to two dilution values lower than those obtained by microdilution.
TI  - Evaluation of the in vitro Activity of Cefprozil Relative to Other Oral Antimicrobial Agents Against Bacteria in Clinical Specimens from Patients in Sao Paulo With Respiratory Tract Infections.
AB  - Cefprozil is a new oral second generation cephalosporin. Its in vitro antimicrobial activity was evaluated against 371 recent clinical isolates from patients with respiratory infections. We tested the susceptibility of 244 streptococci (96 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 105 group viridans streptococci, 32 Streptococcus agalactiae, and 11 group A beta-hemolitic streptococci) 107 Haemophilus influenzae, and 20 oxacillin-susceptible S.aureus (OSSA). The isolates were susceptibility tested against cefprozil, cefaclor and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid by the E-test method; and against cefadroxil, cefuroxime, cefetamet, erythromycin, and azythromycin by disk diffusion. The methods and the susceptibility categorization followed the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) procedures. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was slightly more active againstH.influenzae (MICs(90) 0.5microg/mL) than cefprozil or cefaclor (MICs(90) 4 and 2microg/mL respectively). Cefprozil demonstrated potent activity against streptococci. Against S.pneumoniae, cefprozil was 2-4 fold more active than cefaclor (MICs(90)0.125 and 0.38microg/mL, respectively). S. pneumoniae susceptibility was 84% to penicillin, 95% to erythromycin and 97% to azithromycin by disk diffusion. Viridans streptococci showed higher MICs for cefprozil and cefaclor (MICs(90) 4microg/mL and 8microg/mL, respectively) and only 50% susceptibility to the macrolides. Cefprozil was four times more active than cefaclor and as active as amoxieillin/clavulanic acid against group A beta-hemolytic streptococci and S.agalactiae. These three compounds showed similar activity against OSSA. In conclusion, cefprozil demonstrated excellent in vitro activity against bacterial species responsible for respiratory infections in Sao Paulo.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of piperacillin in several fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - We investigated activity of piperacillin (PIPC) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. The following results were obtained: 1. PIPC had its MIC90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in Gram-positive bacteria (Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis) and showed its MIC of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible PRSP strains out of 38 isolates of S. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. PIPC showed favorable antibacterial activities as its MIC90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae), except for P. mirabilis in which its MIC90 was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of P. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as PIPC, ABPC, CTM and CZOP. 3. PIPC had its MIC90 of > 128 micrograms/ml in Bacteroides fragilis. From these results, PIPC was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when 20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.
TI  - Distinct effects of surfactant protein A or D deficiency during bacterial infection on the lung.
AB  - Mice lacking surfactant protein (SP)-A (SP-A-/-) or SP-D (SP-D-/-) and wild-type  mice were infected with group B streptococcus or Haemophilus influenzae by intratracheal instillation. Although decreased killing of group B streptococcus and H. influenzae was observed in SP-A-/- mice but not in SP-D-/- mice, deficiency of either SP-A or SP-D was associated with increased inflammation and inflammatory cell recruitment in the lung after infection. Deficient uptake of bacteria by alveolar macrophages was observed in both SP-A- and SP-D-deficient mice. Isolated alveolar macrophages from SP-A-/- mice generated significantly less, whereas those from SP-D-/- mice generated significantly greater superoxide and hydrogen peroxide compared with wild-type alveolar macrophages. In SP-D-/- mice, bacterial killing was associated with increased lung inflammation, increased oxidant production, and decreased macrophage phagocytosis. In contrast, in the absence of SP-A, bacterial killing was decreased and associated with increased lung inflammation, decreased oxidant production, and decreased macrophage phagocytosis. Increased oxidant production likely contributes to effective bacterial killing in the lungs of SP-D-/- mice. The collectins, SP-A and SP-D, play distinct roles during bacterial infection of the lung.
TI  - [National multicenter study of the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against respiratory tract pathogens. Spanish Study Group on Moxifloxacin].
AB  - The activity of moxifloxacin, a novel 8-methoxyquinolone, was evaluated against 1,218 respiratory pathogens isolated in nine Spanish hospitals and was compared with ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefuroxime, erythromycin and clarithromycin. Moxifloxacin exhibited an excellent in vitro activity against most tested isolates with MIC90 values of 0.25 mg/l for Streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci; 0.12 mg/l for Streptococcus pyogenes; 0.25 mg/l for Streptococcus agalactiae; 0.06 and 4 mg/l for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, respectively; 0.06 mg/l for Haemophilus influenzae and 0.12 mg/l for Moraxella catarrhalis. Moxifloxacin susceptibility rates were not affected by penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae and S. viridans, by the betalactamase production in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis or by macrolide resistance. Moxifloxacin was twice as active as sparfloxacin and four to sixteen times more active than ciprofloxacin against Gram-positive isolates. Sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were slightly more active than moxifloxacin when tested against H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis isolates. The microbiological data obtained confirm that moxifloxacin is a promising antimicrobial agent for treating respiratory tract infections.
TI  - [National Multicenter study of the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against respiratory tract pathogens]
AB  - The activity of moxifloxacin, a novel 8-methoxyquinolone, was evaluated against 1,218 respiratory pathogens isolated in nine Spanish hospitals and was compared with ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefuroxime, erythromycin and clarithromycin. Moxifloxacin exhibited an excellent in vitro activity against most tested isolates with MIC90 values of 0.25 mg/l for Streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci; 0.12 mg/l for Streptococcus pyogenes; 0.25 mg/l for Streptococcus agalactiae; 0.06 and 4 mg/l for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, respectively; 0.06 mg/l for Haemophilus influenzae and 0.12 mg/l for Moraxella catarrhalis. Moxifloxacin susceptibility rates were not affected by penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae and S. viridans, by the betalactamase production in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis or by macrolide resistance. Moxifloxacin was twice as active as sparfloxacin and four to sixteen times more active than ciprofloxacin against Gram-positive isolates. Sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were slightly more active than moxifloxacin when tested against H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis isolates. The microbiological data obtained confirm that moxifloxacin is a promising antimicrobial agent for treating respiratory tract infections.
TI  - [A study of bacterial meningitis in Hokkaido between 1994 and 1998].
AB  - We evaluated 82 children with bacterial meningitis in 78 institutions in Hokkaido, Japan between 1994 and 1998. The mean number of cases per year was 16.4 (range, 9 to 30). A male predominance occurred with 52 males and 30 females (1.7:1). Median age was 11 months with a range from 1 day to 11 years. Seventy-eight (95%) of the total were less than 5 years old with 55 (67%) less than 2 years old and 45 (55%) less than 1-year old. Four deaths occurred, giving an overall case fatality rate of 4.9%. Sequelae were seen at discharge in 29%, predominantly sensorineural hearing loss, epilepsy and development delay of varying severity. The main causative organisms were Haemophilus influenzae in 49 patients, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 14, Streptococcus agalactiae in 10 and Escherichia coli in 5. The frequency of poor prognosis was 50% for patients with meningitis due to S. pneumoniae or S. agalactiae compared with 27% for patients with meningitis due to H. influenzae.
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the USA.
AB  - The antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 Gram-positive and 995 Gram-negative organisms collected from various USA sites. Time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0. 016 mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/L), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/L), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.03 mg/L), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/L), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/L). Against Gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. MIC(90)s for gemifloxacin were: Haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/L), Escherichia coli (0.016 mg/L), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/L), Enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/L), Proteus spp. (4 mg/L), Serratia spp. (1 mg/L), Citrobacter freundii (2 mg/L), Morganella morganii (0.12 mg/L), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/L), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/L). Gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x MIC. The PAE for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at 2 and 4 x MIC, although longer PAEs were observed with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x MIC) and shorter PAEs with E. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and K. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). In conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. It has substantially improved potency against Gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. It retains the good Gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged PAEs.
TI  - [Meningitis (II)--acute bacterial meningitis].
AB  - Acute meningitis is a medical emergency, particularly in patients with rapidly progressing disease, mental status changes or neurological deficits. The majority of cases of bacterial meningitis are caused by a limited number of species, i.e. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitis, Listeria monocytogenes, group B Streptococci (Streptococcus agalactiae), Haemophilus influenzae and Enterobacteriaceae. Many other pathogens can occasionally cause bacterial meningitis, often under special clinical circumstances. Treatment of meningitis includes two main goals: Eradication of the infecting organism, and management of CNS and systemic complications. Empiric therapy should be initiated without delay, as the prognosis of the disease depends on the time when therapy is started. One or two blood cultures should be obtained before administering the first antibiotic. Empiric therapy is primarily based on the age of the patient, with modifications if there are positive findings on CSF gram stain or if the patient presents with special risk factors. It is safer to choose regimens with broad coverage, as they can usually be modified within 24-48 hours, when antibiotic sensitivities of the infecting organism become available. Adjunctive therapy with dexamethasone is also administered in severely ill patients concomitantly with the first antibiotic dose. In patients who are clinically stable and are unlikely to be adversely affected if antibiotics are not administered immediately, including those with suspected viral or chronic meningitis, a lumbar puncture represents the first step, unless there is clinical suspicion of an intracerebral mass lesion. Findings in the CSF and on CT scan, if performed, will guide the further diagnostic work-up and therapy in all patients.
TI  - Tissue expander infections in children: look beyond the expander pocket.
AB  - Infection of the expander pocket is the most common complication encountered with soft-tissue expansion. It is usually due to direct inoculation with skin flora either at the time of expander insertion or from extrusion of the device. The authors report two cases of infection of tissue expanders in which the children had concomitant infected sites distant from the prosthesis. Etiological bacteria of common pediatric infections like otitis media and pharyngitis were cultured from the infected expander pocket, raising suspicion that translocation of the organism to the expander had occurred. Aggressive antibiotic treatment, removal of the prosthesis, and flap advancement is advocated.
TI  - Etiology of serious infections in young Gambian infants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite improvements in infant mortality rates in many developing countries including The Gambia, neonatal mortality remains high and many neonatal deaths are caused by infection. The study described in this paper was conducted to determine the bacterial and viral etiology of serious infections in Gambian infants younger than 91 days old. METHODS: At a first level health facility 497 infants with symptoms that could indicate serious infection were enrolled, of whom 239 with 1 or more signs of serious infection and 55 with no signs were investigated, yielding 17 cases with positive bacterial cultures of blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid. At a nearby pediatric referral hospital 198 infants were seen and 182 were investigated, yielding 35 positive bacterial cultures. RESULTS: There were 15 culture positive cases of meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (7), Streptococcus pyogenes (2), Enterobacter cloacae (2), Escherichia coli (1), Haemophilus influenzae type b (1), Streptococcus agalactiae (1) and Salmonella spp. (1). Six of these children died. Thirty-three infants without meningitis had positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus aureus (17), S. pneumoniae (3), Salmonella spp. (5), E. coli (3), other enterobacteria (4) and S. agalactiae (1), of whom 14 died. Nasopharyngeal aspirates from 438 children were investigated for common respiratory viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus was found in 51, influenza A in 46, influenza B in 22, parainfluenza in 26 and adenovirus in 16. Respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A isolates were found most frequently toward the end of the wet season. Nasopharyngeal carriage of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae was studied in 320 infants recruited during the first year. Of these 184 (58%) were positive for S. pneumoniae and 141 (44%) were positive for H. influenzae, 18 of which were type b. Infants with a bacterial isolate from blood or cerebrospinal fluid were more likely than the rest to die, whereas those with a viral isolate were less likely to die. CONCLUSIONS: The most important causes of serious infections in young Gambian infants are Staphylococcus aureus, S. pneumoniae and Salmonella spp.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (CFDN) and cefditoren (CDTR). FK041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK041 was active against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms except Enterococcus faecalis with MIC90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. FK041 was more active than CFDN and CDTR against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to CFDN and CDTR against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. FK041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae with an MIC range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to CFDN but inferior to CDTR. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, FK041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of CFDN and CDTR. However, it was inferior to CDTR in activity against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Morganella morganii, and Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With FK041 a small difference between MIC and MBC against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. FK041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. The stability of FK041 to these enzymes was similar to those of CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of S. aureus (PBP 3, 2, and 1) and E. coli (PBP 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
TI  - Susceptibility to levofloxacin of clinical isolates of bacteria from intensive care and haematology/oncology patients in Switzerland: a multicentre study.
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the susceptibility of clinical isolates to levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone with extended activity against Gram-positive bacteria, and other antibiotics in 12 Swiss clinical microbiology laboratories using the NCCLS disc diffusion technique. Isolates were prospectively collected from intensive care units (ICUs (59%), oncology wards (7%) and other units with haematology/oncology patients (34%) from June 1995 to March 1996. The levofloxacin breakpoints used were as recommended by the manufacturer. A total of 310 Gram-positive and 580 Gram-negative isolates from the respiratory tract (36%), skin/wounds (12%), blood (16%), urine (17%) and other sources (19%) were tested. The percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin was 100% for Enterococcus spp. (38 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (13), Streptococcus pneumoniae (65), Acinetobacter spp. (11), Citrobacter diversus (6), Citrobacter freundii (17), Klebsiella oxytoca (39), Morganella morganii (16), Proteus mirabilis (20), Proteus vulgaris (23), Serratia spp. (19), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (10) and Haemophilus influenzae (41). The percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin for Staphylococcus aureus (95 strains, including 2% MRSA) was 94%, coagulase-negative staphylococci (85) 65%, Enterobacter spp. (75) 99%, Escherichia coli (111) 97%, Klebsiella pneumoniae (45) 98% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (124) 87%. In conclusion, levofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone to which the most common clinical isolates in Switzerland are susceptible. The susceptibility of Enterococcus spp. and S. pneumoniae to levofloxacin was particularly remarkable. This compound appears to be a promising therapeutic alternative for the treatment of Gram-positive infections.
TI  - Spectrum and antimicrobial activity of alexomycin (PNU-82, 127), a peptide compound projected for use in animal health.
AB  - Alexomycin (PNU-82, 127) is a thiopeptide antimicrobial complex intended for veterinary practice that belongs to a series of cyclic peptides produced by Streptomyces arginensis. MICs against selected routine and fastidious clinical isolates of animal and human origin were determined by broth microdilution or agar dilution reference methods. Alexomycin was active against Gram-positive pathogens such as oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (260 strains; MIC90, 0.5 microgram/mL), as well as Enterococcus species (95 strains; MIC90, 0.25 to 0.5 microgram/mL), and generally inactive against Gram-negative aerobes. Alexomycin had more potent activity against Streptococcus bovis (MIC90, 0.12 microgram/mL), S. agalactiae (MIC90, 0.12 microgram/mL), Corynebacterium species (MIC90, 0.06-0.12 microgram/mL), and Listeria monocytogenes (MIC90, 0.5 microgram/mL). Alexomycin activity was limited against Bacillus species (MIC90, 1 microgram/mL), Neisseria meningiditis (MIC90, 2 micrograms/mL), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, 8 micrograms/mL), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 16 micrograms/mL), and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC90, 32 micrograms/mL). This thiopeptide complex was also found to be stable at low concentrations (0.015-32 micrograms/mL) in Mueller-Hinton broth for up to 24 h, possesses static antimicrobial activity and did not produce resistant mutants after multiple passages at subinhibitory drug concentrations. Alexomycin seems to have potential for use as a feed additive to increase feed efficiency and promote growth in poultry and swine as well as other applications against Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Maternal immunization.
AB  - Maternal immunization can enhance passive immunity of infants to pathogens that cause life-threatening illnesses. In most instances, immunization during pregnancy will provide important protection for the woman as well as for her offspring. The tetanus toxoid and influenza vaccines are examples of vaccines that provide a double benefit. Other vaccines under evaluation include those for respiratory syncytial virus, pneumococci, group B streptococci, and Haemophilus influenzae type b. Although most IgG antibody crosses the placenta in the third trimester, the process is time-dependent, dictating that immunization should be accomplished ideally at least 6 weeks prior to delivery. IgG1 antibodies are transferred preferentially. Maternal immunization has not interfered with active immunization of the infant. Inactivated vaccines administered in the third trimester of pregnancy pose no known risk to the woman or to her fetus.
TI  - Evaluation of an extended diagnostic PCR assay for detection and verification of  the common causes of bacterial meningitis in CSF and other biological samples.
AB  - A seminested polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostic assay was evaluated for detection and verification of Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Steptococcus agalactiae and Listeria monocytogenes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and other biological samples. A general bacterial amplicon from the 16S rRNA gene was amplified in a first step, and species-specific regions in a second. The detection level was 4 fg DNA/reaction, corresponding to about one bacterial genome per reaction tube. Sample preparations (Dynabeads DNA DIRECT kit) were assayed from 140 bacterial strains suspended in saline. In CSF the detection level for bacteria was 10(3)CFU ml-1for N. meningitidis, H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae, 10(4)CFU ml-1for Escherichia coli and 10(5)CFU ml-1for S. agalactiae and L. monocytogenes. The detection levels for these bacteria were the same in the other tested biological samples, like blood with or without culture media. Clinical CSF samples were evaluated from 71 patients with proven bacterial meningitis, as were 61 CSF samples from individuals without bacterial meningitis. The diagnostic sensitivity of the assay in detecting bacteria in general was 0.97, and for the specific species in the clinical CSF samples 0.87-0.94. The specificity was 1.0 for detecting bacteria in general. Some cross-reactions were noted within the streptococcus group. The PCR results were verified by banding patterns of Hae III digested PCR products.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the urine of children with urinary tract infections from 1986 to 1995].
AB  - In adults and in children urinary system infections are mostly caused by gram-negative and rarely by gram-positive bacteria. Of gram-negative bacteria the most frequent cause of infections are Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Serratia etc., and of gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus agalactiae. In rare cases the cause of infection may also be Pneumococcus and Haemophilus influenzae. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the study was to investigate the sensitivity to antibiotics of gram-negative bacteria as the predominant cause of urinary infections. METHOD OF THE STUDY: We isolated 20,615 bacterium species from urine of children hospitalized or treated as outpatients at the University Children's Hospital in Belgrade. Urine was collected classically, i.e. by taking the second clean stream into a sterile test tube or by Uricult test. The samples were cultured on blood plates and endo-agar. Identification was done by standard bacteriologic methods and when findings were dubious API-20E (bioMerieux) was used. Bacterium sensitivity to nine antibiotics (ampicillin, cephalexin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, amikacin, co-trimoxazole, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin) was assessed with disc diffuse method on Muller-Hinton agars. RESULTS: Based on the obtained results, Escherichia coli species sensitivity to amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin ranged from 90 to 100%; sensitivity to co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol ranged from 70 to 80%, to cephalexin from 50 to 60%, while to ampicillin it was only 20%. Klebsiella species sensitivity to nalidixic acid and cefotaxime was 70-85%; to amikacin, cefotaxime, co-trimoxazole and gentamicin 60-80%; to cephalexin and chloramphenicol 40-50%, and to ampicillin only 5-15%. Proteus species showed sensitivity to amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime and nalidixic acid of 90-95%; to co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol 70-80%; to cephalexin and ampicillin 40-50%, and to nitrofurantoin 10%. Pseudomonas aeruginosa species showed the highest level of sensitivity to amikacin (40-50%), and somewhat lower to gentamicin (10-40%), and a very low sensitivity to other antimicrobial drugs (10-25%). DISCUSSION: It may be noted from the above data that gram-negative bacteria are the cause of urinary infections in about 90% of cases, while gram-positive bacteria are the cause in only 10%, which is in accordance with data from literature. Of all antibiotic drugs ampicillin (a wide spectrum penicillin) had a very significant role in the therapy of urinary infections. However, the long-term usage of ampicillin led to increased resistance to the drug in infections caused by Escherichia coli. Natural resistance to ampicillin of Klebsiella species limited its usage when penicillin was first introduced. Proteus mirabilis species, especially those isolate in primary infection, are often sensitive to amino penicillin. Contrary to Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus and Providentie species show a high resistance to these antibiotics. Due to the crisis in our country and the lack of other antibiotics, ampicillin was widely used. The wide use of the drug caused evident resistance of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis to this antibiotic. A fall in the sensitivity of Klebsiella to cephalexin, gentamicin, amikacin and co-timoxazole, which occurred in 1992, has been explained by intrahospital circulation of multiresistant Klebsiella species. The sensitivity of isolated gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most prominent to aminoglycosides (amikacin and gentamicin). The most frequent mechanism of enterobacterial resistance to trimethoprim and co-trimoxazole involves dihydrofolate reductase enzyme. Comparative studies related to the administration of co-trimoxazole have shown that the difference in the efficacy between thes
TI  - [Study on bacteremia due to community-acquired infection in infants and children  without underlying diseases].
AB  - Between July 1988 and June 1998, 22 pediatric patients without underlying diseases were diagnosed as bacteremia caused by community-acquired infection in Asahikawa Kosei Hospital. The age range of the patients was from 7 days to 4 years. Their diseases were meningitis in 6, urinary tract infection in 6, respiratory tract infection in 4, skin infection in 2, and unknown origin in 4. The causative organisms were Escherichia coli in 7, Haemophilus influenzae in 4, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 4, Staphylococcus aureus in 2, Streptococcus pyogenes in 1, Streptococcus agalactiae in 1, Listeria monocytogenes in 1, Moraxella catarrhalis in 1, and Rahnella aquatilis in 1. Though 21 patients recovered with antimicrobial treatment, only one patient with H. influenzae meningitis had lateral deafness and paresis in the lower limbs as sequelae.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on tazobactam/piperacillin in pediatric field].
AB  - A drug susceptibility test of the combination drug TAZ/PIPC, which consists of a  newly developed beta-lactamase inhibitor, tazobactam (TAZ), and one of penicillin antibiotics, piperacillin (PIPC), with combination ratio of 1:4 in potency, was conducted with stock strains and clinical isolates. The clinical efficacy and safety of its injection was also evaluated in children with a variety of infectious diseases. The results were as follows: 1. In susceptibility test, 114 strains from 4 species of stock strains were treated with 8 drugs, that is, TAZ/PIPC, PIPC, penicillin G (PCG), ampicillin (ABPC), cefotiam (CTM), cefotaxime (CTX), ceftazidime (CAZ), and sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ). Of three clinically isolated species from patients, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) was treated with TAZ/PIPC, PIPC, methicillin (DMPPC), CTM, CTX, and SBT/CPZ, and the others were treated with the same drugs except for DMPPC. The MICs were measured for these bacterial strains inoculated at the concentration of 10(6) CFU/ml. The MIC90 values of TAZ/PIPC against 45 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes), one of the stock cultures of Gram-positive cocci, were 0.05 microgram/ml and similar to those of PIPC, CTM, CAZ, and SBT/CPZ. The MICs of TAZ/PIPC for 28 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae (S. agalactiae) were 0.39 microgram/ml and similar to those of PIPC, CTM, CAZ, and SBT/CPZ. As for Gram-negative bacilli, the MIC90 of TAZ/PIPC against 10 strains of Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) were 0.10 microgram/ml and similar to those of PIPC. The MIC90 of TAZ/PIPC against 31 strains of Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) were 0.05 microgram/ml and similar to those of PIPC, CTX, and SBT/CPZ. Regarding Gram-positive cocci isolated from patients received this combination drug, the MIC90 of TAZ/PIPC against 2 strains of S. aureus, a non beta-lactamase producing strain and a low-beta-lactamase producing strain, were 0.78 microgram/ml and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively; the former value was similar to those of PIPC, DMPPC, CTM, and CTX, and the latter was similar to those of PIPC, DMPPC, CTX, and SBT/CPZ. Of 4 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains were inhibited at 0.05 microgram/ml, and the others at 1.56 micrograms/ml; both values were similar to those of PIPC, SBT/CPZ. As for Gram-negative bacilli, 6 of 7 strains of H. influenzae did not produce beta-lactamase and 1 strain was a high producer. The MICs of TAZ/PIPC against beta-lactamase nonproducing strains were < or = 0.025 microgram/ml in 5 strains and 0.39 microgram/ml in 1 strain, and the values were similar to those of PIPC and SBT/CPZ. While the MIC of TAZ/PIPC against the high beta-lactamase producing strain was 0.78 microgram/ml; similar to that of SBT/CPZ and smaller than that of PIPC. 2. The results of clinical effects on 7 diseases in 33 cases were as follows: TAZ/PIPC was clinically judged "excellent" in 17 (51.5%); good in 14 (42.4%); fair in 2 (6.1%). No case with no response was seen in this study, and the total efficacy rate of "excellent" and "good" was 93.9%. 3. Bacteriological effects were evaluated in 17 strains of 4 species, and all of them were eradicated. 4. Adverse reactions were judged in 35, which consisted of 33 in which the clinical effects were evaluated and 2 dropped from this study. Of these cases, diarrhea was observed in 4 (11.4%). 5. Laboratory tests revealed an increase in platelets in 1 of 32 cases (3.1%), and eosinophilia in 2 of 29 cases (6.9%). Biochemical profile showed an increase in GPT alone and abnormal increases in both GOT and GPT in 1 each out of 21 cases.
TI  - Acute bacterial meningitis in children admitted to the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi in 1996-97.
AB  - To design appropriate interventions, we collected clinical and demographic data prospectively on all children aged one day to 14 years admitted with a diagnosis of bacterial meningitis (BM) from April 1st 1996 to March 31st 1997 to the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH), Blantyre, Malawi. During the study period 267 children (2.7% of all paediatric admissions) were found to have BM; 83% were under 5 years of age, 61% under one year and 23% under one month. The most common causative organisms in the post neonatal period (n=206) were Streptococcus pneumoniae (27%), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) 21%, and Salmonella typhimurium (6%). In the neonatal group (< 1 month, n=61) the most common causes were Streptococcus agalactiae (23%), S. typhimurium (15%), S. pneumoniae (11.5%) and other Gram negative rods (11.5%). Nineteen of 21 salmonella infections were in children under one year of age and all S. agalactiae were in infants under three months. There was delay on presentation: the average length of fever was 4.6 days, 39.5% had convulsed prior to arrival and 57% had an altered level of consciousness. An initial diagnosis of malaria had probably contributed to the delay in 22.5% (42 of 186 tested). 48% were < 80% weight for age, with 18% < 60%) weight for age. The overall mortality was 40%. The outcome was worst in salmonella infections, particularly neonatal salmonella BM with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 89% (8 of 9 cases). Coma on presentation worsened prognosis (mortality 64% if Blantyre Coma Score < 3, 26% if > 3). 15% of survivors had sequelae on discharge. 20% of Hib isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol, but all salmonellae were sensitive. 5% of S. pneumoniae were resistant to penicillin and 8% to chloramphenicol. Earlier access to adequate health care and awareness of BM in a malaria-endemic area would reduce mortality and morbidity. Vaccination against Hib infection would have reduced death by 18 (17%) and prevented sequelae in 7 cases.
TI  - Azithromycin. A review of its use in paediatric infectious diseases.
AB  - Azithromycin is an azalide antimicrobial agent active in vitro against major pathogens responsible for infections of the respiratory tract, skin and soft tissues in children. Pathogens that are generally susceptible to azithromycin include Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), Moraxella catarrhalis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella spp., Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae. Azithromycin is also generally active against erythromycin- and penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Azithromycin is administered once daily, achieves clinically relevant concentrations at sites of infection, is slowly eliminated from the body and has few drug interactions. In children, azithromycin is usually given as either a 3-day course of 10 mg/kg/day or a 5-day course with 10 mg/kg on the first day, followed by 5 mg/kg/day for a further 4 days. These standard regimens were as effective as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, clarithromycin, cefaclor and amoxicillin in the treatment of children with otitis media. Azithromycin was also as effective as either phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V), erythromycin, clarithromycin or cefaclor against streptococcal pharyngitis or tonsillitis in children, but appears to result in more recurrence of infection than phenoxymethylpenicillin in this indication, necessitating a dosage of 12 mg/kg/day for 5 days. Community-acquired pneumonia, bronchitis and other respiratory tract infections in children responded as well to azithromycin as to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefaclor, erythromycin or josamycin. Azithromycin was similar or superior to ceftibuten in mixed general practice populations of patients. However, symptoms of lower respiratory tract infections resolved more rapidly with azithromycin than with erythromycin, josamycin or cefaclor. Skin and soft tissue infections responded as well to azithromycin as to cefaclor, dicloxacillin or flucloxacillin, and oral azithromycin was as effective as ocular tetracycline in treating trachoma. Although not as well tolerated as phenoxymethylpenicillin in the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis, azithromycin is at least as well tolerated as most other agents used to treat respiratory tract and other infections in children and was better tolerated than amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Adverse events that do occur are mostly gastrointestinal and tend to be mild to moderate in severity. CONCLUSIONS: Azithromycin is an effective and well tolerated alternative to first-line agents in the treatment of respiratory tract, skin and soft tissue infections in children, offerring the convenience of a short, once-daily regimen.
TI  - [Trend of bacterial meningitis in children over a 14 year period (1981 through 1994) in Japan--an analysis based on studies in 27 institutions].
AB  - We observed 266 children with purulent meningitis in 27 institutions in Japan during the 14 years from 1981 on dividing these years into 3 periods, 1981-1985, 1986-1990 and 1991-1994, and studied the trend of causative organisms identified in 254 among the 266 patients. Their ages were less than 3 months after birth in 50 children and 3 months or older in 216: there were 141 boys and 125 girls. The causative organisms were H. influenzae in 134 patients and S. pneumoniae in 50, most of them being aged 3 months or older. Next to the above bacteria ranked S. agalactiae in 29 and E. coli in 12, many of the patients were aged less than 3 months. Staphylococcus spp. was found in 7 patients and about 70% of them were aged 3 months or older. L. monocytogenes was found in 4 patients and N. meningitidis in 3 and they were aged 3 months or older in both patient groups. S. pyogenes, Enterococcus spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., P. Mirabilis and Enterobacter spp. were detected each in 1 patient. The causative organism was unknown in 21 patients and there was no double infection. H. influenzae were detected in 18 patients in 1981-1985 period (36.7%), in 56 in 1986-1990 (54.9%) and in 60 in 1991-1994 (63.8%) showing an increasing tendency, but S. pneumoniae exhibited neither an increasing nor decreasing tendency. There was a decreasing tendency with S. agalactiae and E. coli, but the details were not clear because there were few patients aged less than 3 months. Although the period of coexistence of 4 main bacterial species was not made clear in this study. Listeria is considered to develop mainly in the early childhood, and we believe that the conventional way of using a cephem preparation and ampicillin combined for patients under 6 years need not be altered. However, panipenem (phonetic) is likely to be effective for insensible S. pneumoniae for the time being.
TI  - Detection of meningitis antigens in buffer and body fluids by ultrasound-enhanced particle agglutination.
AB  - The standard test card agglutination of antibody-coated latex by Neisseria meningitidis. Streptococcus group B, Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigens has been compared with a technique involving local concentration of the coated latex in an ultrasonic standing wave. The detection of positive control antigen was enhanced, compared with the test-card procedure, over a 16 to 64 fold range on exposure to ultrasound. Sample filtration eliminated non-specific agglutination on ultrasonic exposure of latex in control serum, urine or concentrated urine. Tests of meningitis patient body fluids showed increased detection of antigen with ultrasound for CSF (11/14 > 7/14) serum (8/13 > 3/13) and concentrated urine (8/17 > 2/17) compared to test card assays. The ultrasound detection of antigen in serum or concentrated urine was comparable to that achieved with CSF on test cards. Serum dilution experiments showed that ultrasound could detect antigen in serum over a 1000 fold concentration range.
TI  - Blood-brain barrier permeability during the development of experimental bacterial meningitis in the rat.
AB  - In an attempt to examine whether routes of bacterial entry into the central nervous system have any bearing on subsequent changes in blood-brain barrier permeability, we examined cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration of circulating 125I-albumin in two different models of experimental meningitis due to K1 Escherichia coli, type III group B streptococcus, or Haemophilus influenzae type b in infant rats: hematogenous meningitis subsequent to subcutaneous inoculation of bacteria vs meningitis induced by direct inoculation of bacteria into the CSF via the cisterna magna. In the model of hematogenous meningitis, the mean CSF penetration was significantly greater in animals with H. influenzae type b meningitis than in those with meningitis due to K1 E. coli or type III group B streptococcus. In contrast, the mean CSF penetration was significantly enhanced in all animals with meningitis induced by intracisternal inoculation regardless of infecting pathogens. Tumor necrosis factor activity in CSF appeared to correlate with the functional penetration of circulating albumin across the blood-brain barrier in both models of experimental meningitis. These findings suggest that the alterations of blood-brain barrier permeability during development of experimental meningitis may vary for different models of inducing meningitis and that the mechanisms responsible for these different permeability changes may be multifactorial.
TI  - [Usefulness of body surface cultures in newborns with early infection risk. Study of 735 neonates].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Difficulty in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis has lead to the practice of superficial cultures. The usefulness of this practice has been criticized repeatedly. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Results of 3881 cultures performed on 735 newborns (age < or = 48 hr) with early infection risk were reviewed. The types of samples chosen were urine (UR), gastric aspirate (GA), pharyngeal (PS), external ear (ES), umbilical swab (US), meconium (MC) and blood. BBV for sepsis for the different samples is calculated, as well as which ones better reflect vertical transmission. RESULTS: At the time of the study, 342 newborns (46.5%) were already colonized. Bacteria most frequently isolated were: E. coli (92), PCN staphylococci (85), enterococci (83) and S. agalactiae (70). Twenty-nine newborns had bacteriemia, with S. agalactiae being the leading cause (16). ES correlated best with positive blood cultures (83.3%). UR culture sensitivity was significantly lower than that of all other samples. The Highest PPVs were for GA, PS and US. NPV was high and similar for all samples (98-99%). ES and US best reflected vertical transmission (p < 0.0001). MC provided the highest number of positive mixed cultures, most of them difficult to evaluate. CONCLUSIONS: Body surface sample advantages are: 1) The possibility of discarding a vertically transmitted infection. 2) Quicker positive results than those in blood whenever liquid blood culture media are employed. 3) The possible identification of the etiologic agent when the mother has been given antibiotics intrapartum. 4). Information about dangerous colonization without infection. In order not to lose this useful information, but to save cost and effort, we advise that the number of surface cultures be reduced, keeping only ES and PS?
TI  - Bacterial complications of primary varicella in children.
AB  - Bacterial complications of varicella in 84 patients younger than 16 years of age  (48 females; median age, 2.9 years) who required hospitalization between 1985 and 1995 were retrospectively analyzed. The purpose of the study was to describe demographics, clinical manifestations, bacteriology, and factors affecting outcome. Seventy-six percent of patients were younger than 5 years of age. The eldest children in households were significantly underrepresented (P = .00025). Skin infections occurred in 61 patients (73%), and deep-seated infections and/or shock occurred in 23 (27%). The latter complications were significantly associated with thrombocytopenia (P = .011) and bacteremia (P = .014) at the time of admission, prolonged fever (P = .001), prolonged hospitalization (P < .0001), intensive care management (P < .0001), and fatal outcome (P = .019). Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (59% of isolates) and Staphylococcus aureus (28%) were the predominant isolates. Before and after 1990, five (31%) of 16 and 13 (62%) of 21 streptococcal complications, respectively, were invasive infections (P = .09). These data underscore the need for universal immunization against chickenpox.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of meropenem against clinically isolated strains. The result against strains isolated from blood and cerebrospinal fluid].
AB  - In order to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of meropenem (MEPM), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of MEPM and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates from blood and cerebrospinal fluid that were obtained from January, 1993 to December, 1994. The results are summarized as follows; 1. The MIC-range, 50% MIC (MIC50) and 90% MIC (MIC90) of MEPM were equal to those of imipenem (IPM) and panipenem (PAPM) against Streptococcus pneumoniae including benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive or -resistant S. pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Listeria monocytogenes which are Gram-positive strains, and were stronger than those of ampicillin (ABPC) and cefotaxime (CTX). 2. The MIC-range, MIC50 and MIC90 of these 3 drugs of carbapenems (MEPM, IPM and PAPM) were different against Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae which are Gram-negative strains. The MIC90 of MEPM was < or = 0.025 microgram/ml and those of IPM and PAPM were 0.2 microgram/ml against E. coli. The MIC90 of MEPM was 0.1 microgram/ml, that of IPM was 25 micrograms/ml and that of PAPM was 6.25 micrograms/ml against H. influenzae. Thus, the antimicrobial activity of MEPM was stronger than those of IPM and PAPM. The MIC90's of IPM and PAPM against H. influenzae were high with the MIC of IPM at 12.5 approximately 25 micrograms/ml and the MIC of PAPM at 3.13 approximately 12.5 micrograms/ml against 3 IPM-resistant strains among 17 isolates. 3. The MIC90 of ABPC was 0.39 microgram/ml and that of CTX was 0.1 microgram/ml against 20 strains of S. pneumoniae including 6 strains of PCG-insensitive or resistant S. pneumoniae. The MIC90 of ABPC and CTX were higher than those of 3 carbapenem drugs. There were E. coli of 8 strains with ABPC-high resistance (the MIC of ABPC was > 100 micrograms/ml) and 2 strains for which MIC of CTX were 0.39 microgram/ml and 3.13 micrograms/ml. It was found that 29.4% of H. influenzae were beta-lactamase producing strains. 4. It appeared that antimicrobial activities of carbapenems, particularly MEPM were strong against clinical isolates from blood and cerebrospinal fluid. MEPM will be first choice drug by empiric therapy in infections including sepsis and purulent meningitis.
TI  - Diffusion of 3-quaternary ammonium cephem antibiotics into cerebrospinal fluid of patients with bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Cefepime and cefpirome are new beta-lactamase resistant parenteral cephalosporin  derivatives whose spectrum of activity makes them suitable for use in the treatment of severe infections such as bacterial meningitis. However, the published information on the penetration of these new agents into human CSF and on their use in the treatment of bacterial meningitis are really scarce. Experimental studies have shown that cefepime and cefpirome penetrated remarkably well into the CSF of animals infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The mean changes in bacterial colony count in CSF after cefpirome or cefepime administration express the antibacterial activity of these drugs. Studies in patients show that cefepime and cefpirome crossed the blood-brain barrier and reached concentrations in the CSF that are bactericidal against most potential pathogens. Higher levels are likely to be achieved with multiple dosing and in the presence of inflamed meninges. No study has been performed to investigate the efficacy of cefpirome in the treatment of bacterial meningitis. Cefepime was as effective and safe as cefotaxime for treatment of patients with bacterial meningitis as shown in the only clinical trial.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: results of eight European countries.
AB  - In this multicenter study conducted in eight European countries, 13,173 pathogens--all isolated from community-acquired infections in 1992 and 1993--were evaluated for their susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin G, ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. Ten centers in Italy, five in Germany, in the Netherlands and Switzerland, four in Greece and Spain, three in Hungary and one in Finland contributed to this study; ready-to-use standardized microtiter panels (Sceptor system, BBL, Heidelberg, Germany) were used throughout all assays. The most frequently encountered species were: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and non-typhoid Salmonella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter freundii, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Moraxella catarrhalis and Shigella spp. The percentage of susceptible isolates was assessed for each of the above-mentioned countries and European-wide with all the data available. For many species, the percentage of resistant isolates did not differ markedly between the countries considered. However, one of the most striking exceptions was the high prevalence of high-level penicillin-G-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates in Hungary and Spain; some of the low-level penicillin-G-resistant strains remained susceptible to cefuroxime, whereas complete cross-resistance occurred for all other beta-lactams studied. The high frequency of ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae isolates in Spain deserves mentioning; this could be attributed mainly to the prevalence of a beta-lactamase, as the addition of clavulanic acid rendered these strains susceptible to ampicillin. The penicillin compounds exhibited the greatest activity against Gram-positive pathogens, whereas cefetamet was the most active agent against Gram-negative pathogens with a well-balanced spectrum of activity.
TI  - Cefetamet pivoxil: comparable evaluation with other orally available antibiotics  against selected species of respiratory pathogens.
AB  - Cefetamet pivoxil, the prodrug ester of cefetamet, is a new third-generation cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity. The in vitro activity of cefetamet was superior to that of cefaclor, ceftibuten, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, and amoxicillin alone when tested against 403 strains of freshly isolated upper and lower respiratory tract pathogens. Cefetamet killed 100% Haemophilus influenzae and H. parainfluenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains, at < or = 0.25 mg/l, Streptococcus pyogenes and S. pneumoniae at < or = 0.5 mg/l, S. agalactiae at < or = 0.1 mg/l, and streptococci at < or = 2.0 mg/l. Moreover, at < or = 4 mg/l (breaking point), cefetamet was also highly effective against Escherichia coli (94%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (92%), K. oxytoca (91%) and, at 1 mg/l, against Moraxella catarrhalis (90%), including beta-lactamase-producing strains. Furthermore, time-killing analyses at 4 x MIC demonstrated that cefetamet was bactericidal against beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and K. pneumoniae within 6 h and S. pneumoniae within 4 h. Hydrolysis studies confirmed cefetamet's stability to TEM1 and SHV1, the most common enterobacterial beta-lactamases.
TI  - An approach to the identification of the pathogens of bacterial meningitis by the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - A combination of universal and species-specific primers was used to detect and differentiate by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) the four species most commonly causing bacterial meningitis. Primers recognising conserved sequences in the 16S and 23S ribosomal RNA genes were employed to amplify the 16S-23S spacer region from Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae (type b), Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus). The sequence of the most abundant spacer product was determined in each case and used to deduce species-specific primers. A nested PCR using universal primers in the first round and a species-specific primer in the second were able to detect and distinguish between the four common pathogens, in the presence of human DNA. Streptococcus pneumoniae DNA was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of a meningitis patient with negative culture and Gram-stain results.
TI  - Effect of urine latex agglutination tests on the treatment of children at risk for invasive bacterial infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Identifying febrile children with invasive bacterial infection is difficult in the absence of telltale physical findings. Urine latex agglutination (ULA) tests have been used for rapid, on-site identification of such children. OBJECTIVES: To study the performance of ULA tests in identifying children with Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and group B streptococcus infection and to examine how the results of ULA tests affect patient treatment. DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Urban children's hospital. PATIENTS: All emergency department and hospital patients tested by ULA in 1990, excluding patients in the neonatal units. RESULTS: Of 1629 patients, 36 had positive tests (20 H influenzae, 5 S pneumoniae, and 11 group B streptococcus). Thirteen of these were false positive based on culture results. Although ULA tests demonstrated excellent specificity, their sensitivity was poor. Positive predictive values for bacteremia ranged from 0.346 to 0.600, and negative predictive values ranged from 0.972 to 0.997. The decision to treat with antibiotics was made before ULA test results were available in 19 (53%) of the 36 patients with positive test results. Of 1593 patients with negative test results, 1211 (76%) were admitted to the hospital, and approximately 81% were empirically treated with parenteral antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: In clinical practice, treatment and disposition decisions are frequently made without regard to ULA test results.
TI  - Neonatal infection due to Haemophilus influenzae biotype IV.
AB  - Neonatal infection due to Haemophilus influenzae has several clinical similarities to infection by the more common Streptococcus agalactiae (Strep group B). A high frequency of H. influenzae biotype IV in association with genital, maternal and neonatal infections has been reported in the literature, suggesting this biotype has an affinity for the female genital tract. Cefotaxime should be considered as part of the treatment regimen when this organism is suspected because of the emerging resistance of H. influenzae to ampicillin. We present a case of H. influenzae biotype IV infection in a premature (32 weeks) neonate.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: a multi-center study in five Mediterranean countries.
AB  - In 5 Mediterranean countries 7902 pathogens, all isolated in 1992 and 1993 from community-acquired infections, were studied for susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin G, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid (both 2:1 ratio), cefalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. Ten centers in Italy, 4 centers in Greece, 3 centers in Spain, and 1 center in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia contributed to this study; all centers used performed standardized microtiter panels (Sceptor, BBL, Heidelberg, FRG). The most frequently isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli (n = 1267), Proteus mirabilis (n = 843), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 771), enteric Salmonella spp. (n = 629), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 486), Citrobacter freundii (n = 383), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 346), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 298), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 294), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 246), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 243), and Shigella spp. (n = 185). Statistical analysis was performed for each of the above countries and for all pooled data available. The penicillin antibiotics were the most active compounds against the gram-positive cocci, exceeding the MIC90 values 2- to 8-fold over all cephalosporins. Regarding the gram-negatives (above all Klebsiella spp.) cefetamet was by far the most active compound (MIC90 = 1 mg/l). Regarding the percentage of resistant isolates, there were no striking discrepancies between the centers and countries involved in this study. There was, however, complete cross-resistance in penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates (MIC90 = 2 mg/l). By far the majority of the penicillin-resistant pneumococci showed additional resistance to doxycycline and erythromycin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Rapid diagnosis of bacterial meningitis by a seminested PCR strategy.
AB  - A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based diagnostic assay has been developed for the simultaneous detection in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Listeria monocytogenes and bacteria in general. In the present communication we describe the design of primers for S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, and L. monocytogenes, and a general PCR protocol for the assay. The diagnostic outcome is presented for a small collection of CSF specimens including 2 samples from patients with culture-negative purulent meningitis.
TI  - Latex particle agglutination tests on the cerebrospinal fluid. A reappraisal.
AB  - Rapid diagnostic tests are often used to identify microbial etiology of infection early. Latex particle agglutination (LPA) tests on the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are frequently used for purpose of rapid diagnosis. We evaluated their usefulness in management of patients with suspected meningitis. We also evaluated the cost effectiveness of LPAs during an 11-month period; 1,540 CSF specimens were tested for H. influenzae type b, Group B streptococcal (GBS), N. meningitidis and S. pneumoniae using LPAs. Only 27 were positive. LPAs were useful in management of only the neonates with GBS infection. On the whole, LPAs were very expensive and not cost-effective.
TI  - [Yearly changes of isolated organisms from the respiratory tract in Hokusho Central Hospital].
AB  - Isolated organisms from the respiratory tract have been studied in our hospital from 1986 to 1993. The total number of samples were 18,345 and samples which showed 10(5) cfu/ml organisms were 8648 in our hospital for 8 years. Enterobacteriacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and glucose nonfermenting gram-negative rods were major isolates in 8 years. Haemophilus influenzae, which used to be the commonest isolate, decreased from 10.9% in 1993 while Enterobacteriacae increased from 8.9% in 1986 to 17.6% in 1993. S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were major isolates from out-patients consisting of 50%, followed by Enterobacteriacae, P. aeruginosa and MSSA. Enterobacteriacae and P. aeruginosa were major isolates from in-patients, followed by MRSA and beta-Streptococcus. Streptococcus agalactiae, Serratia marcescens and Corynebacterium spp. prevailed especially in the geriatric ward. S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were major isolates from patients with pneumoconiosis, especially in winter.
TI  - Opsonic activity of commercially available standard intravenous immunoglobulin preparations.
AB  - Several standard intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG) products are available in the United States and have been used with the intent to treat or prevent infections in neonates. We evaluated more than 100 lots of IVIG, from 6 products, to determine the amount of opsonic antibody against neonatal pathogens. Neutrophil-mediated opsonophagocytosis was used to determine opsonic activity in these preparations for Staphylococcus epidermidis; Haemophilus influenzae type b; Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 3, 14 and 19; Group B Streptococcus serotypes Ia, Ib, Ia/c, II and III; and Escherichia coli (K1). Pathogen-specific opsonic activity of the lots tested ranged from undetectable to 1:80 and was detectable in < 10% to > 90% of lots tested depending on the organism and manufacturer. Within an IVIG lot there was variable opsonic activity against different strains or serotypes of the same organism. Opsonic activity was significantly (P < or = 0.05) affected by the manufacturer's donor pool and less so by the manufacturing method. We conclude that the pathogen-specific opsonic antibody activity of an IVIG lot is: (1) highly variable for several common neonatal pathogens; (2) predominantly dependent on the donor pool and not the manufacturing method. Clinicians may more appropriately select therapy if the pathogen-specific antibody content of IVIG products by lot are known. In the future neonatal IVIG research should focus on using preparations with known pathogen-specific antibody activity.
TI  - Detection of bacterial DNA in cerebrospinal fluid by an assay for simultaneous detection of Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and streptococci using a seminested PCR strategy.
AB  - Primers specific to conserved and variable regions in the 16S rRNA sequence were  selected from the partially sequenced 16S rRNA genes of Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The PCR assay was divided into two DNA amplifications. The first resulted in a general bacterial amplicon, and the second resulted in a species-specific amplicon. The high specificity of the PCR assay was documented after testing bacteria of 28 different species (133 strains). A total of 304 clinical cerebrospinal fluid samples, including 125 samples from patients with bacterial meningitis, were assayed to investigate the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for bacterial meningitis. The assay showed high sensitivity (0.94) and specificity (0.96) with the clinical samples, although some false results were obtained, the reasons for which are discussed. With agarose gel electrophoresis for detection of the PCR products, the detection limit for meningococci in cerebrospinal fluid was 3 x 10(2) CFU/ml.
TI  - [Epidemiology of primary bacterial meningitis].
AB  - In industrialized countries, the incidence of community-acquired bacterial meningitis is between 5 and 10 cases/10(5) population/year. The highest age-specific attack rates are recorded between 0 and 2 years of age and can reach 100 cases/10(5) population/year or more in some countries. In this range of age, Streptococcus agalactiae, Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli are responsible for meningitis in neonates whereas Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae cause meningitis in children older than 1 month. H. influenzae was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children but its incidence has declined since the introduction of routine childhood immunization with conjugate vaccines. N. meningitidis is the leading cause of meningitis in teenagers and young adults, whereas S. pneumoniae is responsible for most of meningitis in the elderly. Prognosis of bacterial meningitis mainly depends on the type of causative organism and on the age of onset. Detailed epidemiologic features of Haemophilus, meningococcal and pneumococcal meningitis are provided.
TI  - Binding of mannan-binding protein to various bacterial pathogens of meningitis.
AB  - Mannan-binding protein (MBP), a calcium-dependent plasma lectin, may play a role  in the innate defence against microorganisms. After binding to carbohydrate structures at the bacterial surface, MBP activates the classical pathway of the complement system. To investigate the binding capacity of MBP to various bacteria associated with meningitis, an assay was developed to study the binding of MBP to bacteria grown in a semisynthetic fluid culture medium. Salmonella montevideo (containing a mannose-rich lipopolysaccharide (LPS)), used as a positive control strain, showed binding of radiolabelled MBP at a level of 80% compared with binding of MBP to zymosan. Binding of labelled MBP to Salm. montevideo was time-dependent, temperature-dependent and saturable. The binding was inhibited by unlabelled MBP, by mannose and by N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. Among bacterial pathogens often found to cause meningitis, a wide range of MBP binding capacities could be determined. The encapsulated Neisseria meningitidis (representatives from 11 serogroups other than group A were included: n = 22), N. mucosa (n = 1), Haemophilus influenzae type b (n = 10) and Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 5) had a low MBP binding capacity of 21.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.3-40.1%). Escherichia coli K1 (n = 11), Strep. suis (n = 5), Strep. pneumoniae (n = 10) and N. meningitidis serogroup A (n = 2) showed intermediate MBP binding capacity of 58.4% (95% CI 40.0-76.8%). A third group consisting of non-encapsulated Listeria monocytogenes (n = 11), non-encapsulated H. influenzae (n = 2), non-encapsulated N. meningitidis (n = 2), N. cinera (n = 1) and N. subflava (n = 1) strains had a high MBP binding capacity of 87.5% (95% CI 62.5-112.5%). The majority of encapsulated pathogens causing bacterial meningitis seem to have a rather low MBP binding capacity.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The aim of our study was to re-evaluate the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics against bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. The study drugs were cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cefixime, cefuroxime, cefetamet, cefprozil, and the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (= augmentin). In addition, cefotaxime as the standard agent of parenteral third generation cephalosporins was examined. The organisms tested were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, streptococci of serogroups C and G, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of the antimicrobials were determined with the agar dilution procedure. Cefpodoxime showed the broadest spectrum and generally also the highest activity of the oral beta-lactam antibiotics examined. The drug was equally active against the major groups of beta-lactamase negative and positive bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. Against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, all beta-lactam agents exhibited reduced activity comparable to the reduced activity of penicillin.
TI  - Clinical usefulness of cerebrospinal fluid bacterial antigen studies.
AB  - A retrospective chart review was performed to evaluate the effect that positive results of cerebrospinal fluid bacterial antigen tests had on the care of patients with presumed bacterial meningitis. Of 901 tests ordered, costing $26,000 per year, 29 showed positive results--and only four of these affected patient care. By using cerebrospinal fluid bacterial antigen testing only when another test does not identify an organism, or in an attempt to determine central nervous system infection late in therapy for presumed sepsis, one can greatly reduce costs with no detrimental effect on patients.
TI  - Evaluation of minocycline and cefuzonam for antimicrobial activity against clinical isolates.
AB  - The Antibacterial activity of minocycline (MINO) and that of cefuzonam (CZON) were assessed with clinical isolates of 19 species, and compared with that of other antibiotics. MINO was highly active against methicilli-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Flavobacterium meningosepticum, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Propionibacterium acnes, but not as effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. CZON was highly active against MSSA, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, N. Gonorrhoeae, M(B). catarrhalis, H. influenzae, H. pylori, P. mirabilis, Peptostreptococcus spp. and P. acnes, but not effective against MRSA. It was minimally active against Gram-negative rods (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, etc.) and bacteria that do not ferment glucose.
TI  - The effects of nonclassic pediatric bacterial pathogens on the usefulness of the  Directigen latex agglutination test.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae type b, Escherichia coli, Neisseria meningitis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae are classically the predominant meningeal pathogens of children. The Directigen latex agglutination test identifies these pathogens by detecting specific antigens in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and urine. The authors tested 1151 specimens from 791 children with suspected meningeal infections. They found that the sensitivity of the Directigen test for detecting the five classic CSF pathogens of children was 83.3% with CSF and 60% with urine specimens. In detecting all pathogens, however, the sensitivity was only 50% with CSF and 37.5% with urine. Thus, an increased prevalence of nonclassic pathogens in a pediatric population adversely affects the efficacy of the Directigen test for confirming a diagnosis of meningitis and emphasizes the diagnostic importance of the clinical history and other routine CSF tests.
TI  - Antimicrobial treatment and prevention of meningitis.
AB  - The efficacy of the conjugate polysaccharide H influenzae type b vaccine has resulted in a reduction in the number of cases of meningitis. Physicians will manage fewer cases of meningitis but they must maintain skills in diagnosis and treatment of the cases that do occur. In addition, to a continuing experience with meningitis due to S pneumoniae and N meningitidis, physicians must be aggressive in obtaining materials for specific diagnosis of aseptic meningitis since many of the infections are treatable with antimicrobial agents. Appropriate treatment of meningitis in children requires knowledge of agents for initial therapy, dosage schedules, changes in the regimen that may be required once the organism is isolated and results of susceptibility tests are available, knowledge of the drugs that require monitoring of serum concentrations to determine safety and efficacy, and antimicrobial prophylaxis for contacts.
TI  - PCR primers and probes for the 16S rRNA gene of most species of pathogenic bacteria, including bacteria found in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - A set of broad-range PCR primers for the 16S rRNA gene in bacteria were tested, along with three series of oligonucleotide probes to detect the PCR product. The first series of probes is broad in range and consists of a universal bacterial probe, a gram-positive probe, a Bacteroides-Flavobacterium probe, and two probes for other gram-negative species. The second series was designed to detect PCR products from seven major bacterial species or groups frequently causing meningitis: Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. The third series was designed for the detection of DNA from species or genera commonly considered potential contaminants of clinical samples, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): Bacillus, Corynebacterium, Propionibacterium, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. The primers amplified DNA from all 124 different species of bacteria tested. Southern hybridization testing of the broad-range probes with washes containing 3 M tetramethylammonium chloride indicated that this set of probes correctly identified all but two of the 102 bacterial species tested, the exceptions being Deinococcus radiopugnans and Gardnerella vaginalis. The gram-negative and gram-positive probes hybridized to isolates of two newly characterized bacteria, Alloiococcus otitis and Rochalimaea henselii, as predicted by Gram stain characteristics. The CSF pathogen and contaminant probe sequences were compared with available sequence information and with sequencing data for 32 different species. Testing of the CSF pathogen and contaminant probes against DNA from over 60 different strains indicated that, with the exception of the coagulase-negative Staphylococcus probes, these probes provided the correct identification of bacterial species known to be found in CSF.
TI  - [The contribution of latex tests for the diagnosis of bacterial infections in Abidjan].
AB  - From 313 samples of CSF, urine, sera and pleural liquid, the authors show how appreciable is the contribution in research of soluble antigens by sensibilized latex particles agglutination method in etiologic diagnosis, especially during meningitis, pulmonary and neonatal infections. Soluble antigens were declared positives in 62.26% of cases against S. pneumoniae, 25.4% of cases against H. influenzae, 6.66% of cases against S. agalactiae, 5.71% of cases against N. meningitidis C, with variable percentages from one biological liquid to another. Compared to classical bacteriologic techniques, this method allows the diagnosis of an infection even when decapitated, and could be used in emergency diagnosis.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of cefepime in vitro.
AB  - Cefepime is a new parenterally active fourth-generation cephalosporin which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. Using the standard agar dilution method we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli (98 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (99 strains), Acinetobacter spp. (24 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (98 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (108 strains), Staphylococcus aureus (100 strains), Enterococcus spp. (45 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (10 strains), Streptococcus pyogenes (group A; 19 strains) and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B; 36 strains). Cefepime showed excellent activity against E. coli and K. pneumoniae, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 0.12 mg/l. The in vitro activity of cefepime was superior to or comparable to the third-generation cephalosporins tested but was inferior to ciprofloxacin against Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa. Against H. influenzae, whether or not the strains produced beta-lactamase, its activity was similar to comparable drugs. All 84 isolates of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime whereas, like other cephalosporins, it had little activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Of the 45 enterococci isolates tested, 44.4% were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime. Against streptococci, its activity was superior to any drug tested. This in vitro study indicates that cefepime has the potential to be a valuable agent for the treatment of community- and hospital-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.
TI  - Agar disk diffusion (Bauer-Kirby) tests with various fastidious and nonfastidious reference (ATCC) strains: comparison of several agar media.
AB  - Several agar media (Mueller-Hinton agar, MHA; diagnostic sensitivity test agar, DSTA; Schaedler agar, SchA; Todd-Hewitt agar with added yeast extract, THYA; Wilkins-Chalgren agar, WCA) were compared using the Bauer-Kirby agar disk diffusion test against six nonfastidious quality control strains: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and ATCC 29213, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and ATCC 35218, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212. MHA, DSTA, and THYA yielded essentially comparable inhibition zones. However, WCA and SchA antagonized cotrimoxazole and aminoglycoside antibiotics; furthermore, SchA antagonized polymyxin B, and both WCA and SchA antagonized imipenem against the P. aeruginosa strain, but not against the E. coli strains. Sheep blood-MHA (Bl-MHA), WCA, THYA, and DSTA were examined with Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615, Streptococcus agalactiae ATCC 13813, and Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 6306. In comparison with Bl-MHA, both WCA and THYA yielded comparable inhibition zones against S. pyogenes; DSTA afforded suboptimal growth. DSTA yielded larger inhibition zones with the majority of antimicrobial drugs against S. agalactiae, whereas WCA and THYA enhanced the activity of oxacillin and penicillin G against this strain. S. pneumoniae strain ATCC 6306 grew well on Bl-MHA, yielded suboptimal growth on WCA and faint growth on THYA, and failed to grow on DSTA. Chocolate-supplemented sheep blood-MHA (CHOC-MHA) was compared with Haemophilus test medium (HTM), WCA with added NAD, and THYA with added hematin and NAD against Haemophilus influenzae strains ATCC 35056 and ATCC 49247. The activities of doxycycline and rifampin were enhanced against both strains by HTM, WCA+NAD, and THYA+hematin+NAD. Only WCA+NAD antagonized cotrimoxazole against both H. influenzae strains, an effect due to thymidine; however, HTM antagonized cotrimoxazole against S. aureus ATCC 25923 and E. coli ATCC 25922. It was concluded that Bl-MHA performed best for beta-hemolytic streptococci quality control strains. Likewise, CHOC-MHA was optimal for the two H. influenzae strains used in this comparative agar disk diffusion study.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of PD 138312 and PD 140248, new fluoronaphthyridines with outstanding gram-positive potency.
AB  - PD 138312 and PD 140248 are new quinolones with high in vitro activities against  a wide spectrum of bacterial species, notably including gram-positive isolates. The respective MICs (in micrograms per milliliter) of PD 138312 and PD 140248 capable of inhibiting > or = 90% of the strains were < or = 0.06 and < or = 0.06 for oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococci, streptococci (including Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, and viridans group streptococci), Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; 0.125 and 0.03 for Legionella pneumophila; 0.25 and 0.125 for Listeria monocytogenes; 0.25 and 0.25 for Enterococcus faecalis; 0.5 and 0.06 for anaerobic gram-positive cocci; 0.5 and 0.25 for Acinetobacter spp.; 0.5 and 0.5 for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (excluding Serratia marcescens); 2 and 0.5 for Bacteroides fragilis; 2 and 2 for Serratia marcescens and ciprofloxacin-resistant staphylococci; and 8 and 4 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - In vitro activities of BAY Y3118, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract and soft tissue infections.
AB  - BAY Y3118 was highly active against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC for 90% of strains tested [MIC90], 0.063 micrograms/ml). For Enterococcus faecalis and Corynebacterium jeikeium, MIC90s were 4 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. BAY Y3118 was as active as ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and had potent activity against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml).
TI  - Management of bacterial meningitis.
AB  - In developed countries the mortality from bacterial meningitis acquired outside the neonatal period is relatively low. In contrast, in developing countries it is often higher (20%-40%). In developed countries despite (and perhaps because of) the introduction of increasingly potent antimicrobials, the morbidity of bacterial meningitis has remained high. For example, up to 25% of patients with Haemophilus influenzae meningitis have some form of neurological deficit. Neisseria meningitidis is the major cause of bacterial meningitis in many areas of the world. A clone of Group A meningococcus has spread from China to cause the most recent major epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa. Group B meningococcal infections causing sporadic meningitis are increasing in parts of Europe and South America. The mortality from meningococcal disease is greatest when there is a septicaemic component to the infection. Although antimicrobial chemotherapy is of major importance some adjuncts to therapy are beneficial. High dose corticosteroid therapy has been shown to decrease mortality in pneumococcal meningitis in an uncontrolled study and to speed recovery and decrease neurological sequelae in H. influenzae meningitis. Nevertheless to prevent infection would be of greater benefit. Prevention can be achieved by either chemoprophylaxis or immunoprophylaxis. Although safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent pneumococcal, H. influenzae (Hib) and Groups A and C meningococcal meningitis; apart from the protein conjugate Hib vaccine they are less effective in children under two years of age. There is no effective vaccine to protect against group B meningococcal meningitis.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin and its effect on bacterial adherence to medical material].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin (CAM) in comparison with other 6 macrolides was determined against 419 recent clinical isolates including Streptococci, Enterococci, Staphylococci, Moraxella, Haemophilus and Bacteroides strains. MICs80's of CAM against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.78, 0.10 and 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. MICs80's against Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae were 0.05 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. Laboratory-induced resistance to CAM in strains of S. pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis occurred in stepwise fashion and at a very low rate. Adherence to silicon filter of strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or S. epidermidis was strongly repressed by the addition of sub-MIC of CAM or other macrolides. Although tosufloxacin (TFLX) alone had no bactericidal activity against the sessile cells of P. aeruginosa strains tested, TFLX showed synergistic bactericidal activity when combined with sub-MICs of CAM or erythromycin.
TI  - Correlating infectious outcome with clinical parameters of 1130 consecutive febrile infants aged zero to eight weeks.
AB  - The study objectives were to characterize the infectious outcomes and associated  clinical parameters of a large group of febrile young infants who received outpatient sepsis evaluation. This retrospective review of consecutive cases during a seven-year period was set in an urban pediatric emergency department. Febrile infants, aged zero to eight weeks, were the participants. All received a standard evaluation for sepsis, including complete blood count/blood culture, lumbar puncture/cerebrospinal fluid culture, and urinalysis/urine culture. Of 1130 patients, 447 (42%) were aged zero to four weeks, and 683 (58%) were aged four to eight weeks. In 96 cases (8.5%), a bacterial pathogen was isolated by culture of cerebrospinal fluid, blood, urine, or stool; 58% were aged zero to four weeks and 42% were aged four to eight weeks. The rate of positive cultures per patient age was doubled in those aged zero to four weeks (12%) compared with those aged four to eight weeks (6%). The 49 cases of invasive bacterial infections (bacterial meningitis/bacteremia) were most commonly associated with lower degrees of fever, as slightly over one half (25/49) had temperature < 39 degrees C. The most common pathogens of invasive bacterial infection were group B streptococcus and Escherichia coli, accounting for 33 of 49 cases (67%); the most common pathogens of invasive bacterial infection in older children (Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were relatively underrepresented, accounting for only five of these 49 (10%) cases.
TI  - Cefprozil. A review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties, and therapeutic potential.
AB  - Cefprozil is an orally active cephalosporin which has demonstrated activity against a wide range of organisms in vitro. It is particularly active against the Gram-positive organisms Streptococcus pyogenes, pneumoniae and agalactiae and against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus are not susceptible to cefprozil. Cefprozil is also moderately active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, many Enterobacteriaceae and certain anaerobic organisms, and is relatively stable to hydrolysis by a number of beta-lactamases. In comparative trials, the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of cefprozil 500mg or 20 mg/kg administered once or twice daily has been comparable with multiple daily dosage regimens of erythromycin in patients with tonsillitis or pharyngitis, with cefaclor and amoxicillin/clavulanate in lower respiratory tract infections, with amoxicillin/clavulanate and erythromycin in skin and skin-structure infections and with cefaclor in acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections. The clinical efficacy of cefprozil is similar to that of cefaclor in patients with tonsillitis or pharyngitis but the bacteriological efficacy of cefprozil is significantly greater than that of cefaclor. Cefprozil is clinically more effective than cefuroxime axetil in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections and demonstrated greater efficacy than cefaclor in one of 2 comparative studies when administered twice daily in patients with skin and skin-structure infections. In children with acute otitis media, cefprozil 15 mg/kg twice daily was as effective as cefaclor or amoxicillin/clavulanate 13.3 mg/kg 3 times daily and was as effective as cefixime 8 mg/kg once daily. The most frequently reported adverse effects associated with cefprozil, diarrhoea and nausea, are usually mild to moderate in severity and discontinuation of treatment is rarely necessary. Thus, cefprozil with its convenient administration regimen appears to be a suitable alternative to cefaclor, cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate or erythromycin for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections, skin and skin-structure infections, and otitis media in children. While cefprozil has shown similar efficacy to cefaclor in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, well-controlled clinical trials comparing its efficacy with that of cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim+sulfamethoxazole) in this indication are required.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
AB  - An agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. Among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. Enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Haemophilus influenzae with an MIC90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, and Legionella pneumophila with an MIC of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin inhibited Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Norfloxacin and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (MIC90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and some other Gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. The results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against Gram-negative and Gram-positive species.
TI  - [Clinical study on cefprozil in pediatrics].
AB  - Clinical efficacy and safety of cefprozil (CFPZ, BMY-28100), a newly developed oral cephalosporin, were studied in our pediatric department. Clinical effectiveness, bacteriological effectiveness and side effects were studied in 116 pediatric patients with ages ranging 4 months to 11 years. CFPZ was given 4.6-14.1 mg/kg daily in 3 times for 3-10 days. Clinical efficacies were evaluated in 112 patients, and the therapeutic effectiveness were excellent in 1 and good in 6 for 7 patients with acute pharyngitis, excellent in 24 and good in 26 for acute purulent tonsillitis, excellent in 3, good in 8 and fair in 1 for acute bronchitis, excellent in 21, good in 7, fair in 1 and poor in 1 for acute pneumonia, excellent in 1 acute purulent parotitis, excellent in 2 and good in 7 for acute UTI, good in 1 impetigo, fair in 1 periproctal abscess and good in 1 acute enteritis. The effectiveness rate was 96.4%. Bacteriologically, 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase producing strains), 1 strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis (beta-lactamase producing strain), 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 4 strains of beta-Streptococcus, 1 strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae (beta-lactamase producing strain) and 1 strain of Salmonella C2 were all disappeared, and of 22 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 20 strains were disappeared, 1 was decreased and 1 was unknown, of 5 strains of Escherichia coli (3 beta-lactamase producing strains), 4 were disappeared and 1 was decreased, of 29 strains of Haemophilus influenzae (14 beta-lactamase producing strains), 14 were disappeared, 11 were decreased, 3 persisted and 1 was unknown and of 2 strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae (1 beta-lactamase producing strain), 1 was disappeared and 1 persisted. The bacteriological eradication rates for Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria were 97.1% and 56.8%, respectively, and the drug was especially effective against Gram-positive bacteria. No side effects nor refusal of ingestion were observed. As abnormalities in laboratory test results, 3 cases of elevation of eosinophil counts and 1 of elevation of platelet counts were observed. In conclusion, CFPZ was considered to be a safe and highly effective antibiotic in pediatric infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of RU 29246, the active compound of the cephalosporin prodrug ester HR 916.
AB  - The in vitro activity of RU 29246 was compared with those of other agents against 536 recent clinical isolates. The MICs of RU 29246 for 90% of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested (MIC90s) were less than 2 micrograms/ml except those for Morganella spp. (16 micrograms/ml) and Proteus spp. (8 micrograms/ml). RU 29246 was active against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, < or = 8 micrograms/ml) and against Staphylococcus saprophyticus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC90s, < or = 2 micrograms/ml). Streptococci and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were highly susceptible to RU 29246, and the activity of the agent against isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, < or = 2 micrograms/ml), and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, < or = 2 micrograms/ml) was comparable to those of the other cephalosporins tested. RU 29246 was insusceptible to hydrolysis by the common plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (TEM-1 and SHV-1). However, hydrolysis by the new extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (TEM-3, TEM-5, and TEM-9) was detected. Results of the study suggested that RU 29246 should be investigated clinically for use in the treatment of a wide range of infections.
TI  - [Basic and clinical study of meropenem in pediatric field].
AB  - Meropenem (MEPM), a novel parenteral carbapenem antibiotic, was examined in a cooperative study involving 12 pediatric and 1 neonatologic facilities. The results are summarized as follows. 1. Antibacterial activity Antibacterial activity of MEPM against stock organisms including 31 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 14 of Listeria monocytogenes, 4 of Bordetella pertussis and 3 of Neisseria meningitidis ranged from 0.025 to 0.10 micrograms/ml in MIC90's, which were equal or lower than those of control drugs such as imipenem cefazolin, cefotiam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and latamoxef. MICs against clinical isolates were as follows: In Gram-positive bacteria, MICs were 0.20 micrograms/ml to 6.25 micrograms/ml against 3 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, and 0.025 micrograms/ml or less against 4 of Streptococcus pneumoniae. In Gram-negative bacilli, MICs were 0.10 micrograms/ml to 0.20 micrograms/ml against 3 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 0.78, 0.10 and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively, against one strain each of Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. MIC against 1 strain of Peptococcus saccharolyticus was < or = 0.025 micrograms/ml. 2. Pharmacokinetics Maximum plasma concentrations after intravenous infusion of MEPM over 30 minutes at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg, respectively, to 3 different groups of 3 children (total 9 cases) were observed at the completion of the treatment. Mean maximum concentrations in the 3 groups were 36.3, 69.5 and 129.8 micrograms/ml, respectively, exhibiting clear dose response. Mean plasma half lives in beta phase were 0.94, 0.86 and 0.94 hours, respectively, exhibiting no difference by doses, and this trend was observed also by HPLC. Urinary excretion rates in the first 6 hours after dose in the 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg groups were 67.3, 65.6 and 68.4%, respectively. Concentrations of MEPM in cerebrospinal fluid were determined in 2 cases of pyogenic meningitis. In 1 case, 500 mg (5.9 mg/kg) of MEPM was infused intravenously over 30 minutes and concentrations on Days 6, 8 and 15 observed at 190, 60 and 100 minutes after respective doses were 0.13, 0.10 micrograms/ml and less than the detection limit. Cerebrospinal fluid-plasma concentration ratio was determinable only on Day 8 and was 2.8%. In another case to which 250 mg (38.5 mg/kg) of MEPM was infused intravenously over 30 minutes, the concentration at Days 6, 7 and 10, 1 hour after the dose were less than the detection limit on day 6, and 2.04 and 2.62 micrograms/ml, respectively on days 7 and 10. 3. Clinical efficacy Clinical efficacies were evaluated in 49 cases and the efficacy rate was 93.9%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Haemophilus influenzae and genital infection].
AB  - We report nine cases of H. influenzae genital infections in women. Six patients had a total of 7 episodes of Bartholin glands abscess. One patient developed a post-caesarean endomyometritis on the 16th post-delivery day. The remaining patient developed an amniotic fluid infection in the 32nd week of pregnancy. All the nine H. influenzae strains were sensitive to ampicillin. We assess the rising importance of H. influenzae as an etiologic agent of female genital tract infections.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical evaluations of flomoxef sodium in neonates].
AB  - Flomoxef sodium (FMOX) was evaluated experimentally and clinically in neonates. 1. Serum concentrations and urinary excretions of the drug were examined after a bolus intravenous injection at 20 mg/kg to 22 neonates 1-30 days after birth (durations of pregnancy 31-43 weeks, weights at birth 1,650-4,040 g) and 5 infants 50-95 days after birth (durations of pregnancy 33-40 weeks, weights at birth 1,720-3,308 g). Serum concentrations were 10.8-67.6 micrograms/ml (mean 32.7 +/- 2.8 micrograms/ml) and 25.1-52.0 micrograms/ml (mean 38.9 +/- 4.3 micrograms/ml) in the neonates and the infants, respectively, at their peaks (0.5 hour value), decreased thereafter with half-lives of 0.96-5.59 hours (mean 2.20 +/- 0.26 hours value), and 0.97-1.54 hours (mean 1.22 +/- 0.12 hours value), respectively. Serum levels decreased to 0.2-17.1 micrograms/ml (mean 2.9 +/- 0.6 micrograms/ml) and N.D. -1.1 micrograms/ml (mean 0.4 +/- 0.2 micrograms/ml) after 8 hours, respectively. The urinary recovery rates of the drug in the first 8 hours after administration were 15.0-96.0% (mean 53.7 +/- 4.9%) and 29.9-73.3% (mean 62.4 +/- 9.4%) in the neonates and in the infants, respectively. 2. FMOX was administered to 78 neonates (durations of pregnancy 31-42 weeks, weights at birth 1,420-3,860 g) in whom bacterial infections were established or suspected, and clinical, bacteriological, and side effects were evaluated. In 47 neonates examined (1 with sepsis, 3 with acute upper respiratory infections, 18 with acute pneumonia, 1 with umbilical infection, 1 with impetigo, 4 with acute urinary tract infections, 1 with acute otitis externa, 1 with periproctal abscess, and 17 with intrauterine infections), the treatment was markedly effective in 41, and effective in 6, with an overall efficacy rate of 100%. The bacterilogical effects of the drug on 3 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 1 strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 strain of Streptococcus agalactiae, 9 strains of Escherichia coli, and 2 strains of Haemophilus influenzae which were responsible for these infections were all rated as "eradicated". Moreover, the drug, administered with or without prophylactic intentions showed complete prophylactic effects in all 27 cases tested. No side effects were observed in any of the patients. Concerning abnormal clinical laboratory results, increases in GOT were noted in 2, eosinophilia in 1, and thrombocytosis in 1, but these abnormalities were invariably mild and the normalized in 1 patient without treatment. The results suggest that FMOX is useful and safe also in neonates.
TI  - Direct identification of bacterial isolates in blood cultures by using a DNA probe.
AB  - This study involved the rapid, direct identification of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterococcus sp., and Streptococcus agalactiae from positive blood culture bottles (BACTEC, Johnston Laboratories, Inc.) by using the AccuProbe (Gen-Probe, San Diego, Calif.) culture confirmation test. This method uses a chemiluminescent DNA probe that detects the rRNA of the target organisms. The manufacturer's instructions were modified to use a pellet of bacteria made directly from positive blood culture broth rather than a colony from an agar plate. Two separate procedures of selective centrifugation were employed in order to obtain the pellet. The first utilized a routine clinical centrifuge and a large volume of broth (10 to 12 ml) from the blood culture bottle. The second method used a microcentrifuge and less volume (1 to 1.5 ml). A total of 196 clinical specimens taken directly from positive blood culture broths were correctly identified by AccuProbe from pellets made by using the clinical centrifuge technique, while 166 clinical specimens used as negative controls failed to show hybridization. The microcentrifuge technique for obtaining pellets was performed on 105 patient specimens, and all were correctly identified. When combined with the microcentrifuge technique for pellet preparation, the AccuProbe test has several advantages: (i) direct identification of bacteria from blood culture broths, (ii) rapid turn-around time (30 min), (iii) simplicity of the procedure, and (iv) relative low cost.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical evaluations of cefdinir 10% fine granules in pediatrics].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies on cefdinir (CFDN, FK482)  (10% fine granules), a new oral cephem, were performed in pediatrics. 1. Bioequivalencies of plasma concentrations and urinary excretions of CFDN 5% and 10% fine granules were investigated on 3 pediatric patients with ages between 5 to 13 years administered with a drug in fasting state at a dose level of 3 mg/kg using a cross over method. Average plasma concentrations in a group of patients administered with 5% fine granules peaked at 3 hours after administration with a level of 1.05 +/- 0.29 micrograms/ml (mean +/- S.E.) and decreased to 0.12 +/- 0.05 micrograms/ml at 8 hours with a half-life of 1.48 +/- 0.09 hours. In the group administered with 10% fine granules, average plasma concentrations peaked at 2 hours after administration with a level of 1.32 +/- 0.12 micrograms/ml, and decreased to 0.20 +/- 0.11 microgram/ml at 8 hours with a half-life of 1.68 +/- 0.28 hours. The first 8-hour urinary recovery rates of CFDN in the 5% and 10% fine granules groups averaged 19.64 +/- 5.69% and 23.37 +/- 2.36%, respectively. Both average and individual plasma concentrations and urinary recovery rates in the patients of the 10% fine granules group were somewhat higher than those of the 5% fine granules group, but no significant differences were observed between the 2 groups including areas under concentrations. 2. CFDN 10% fine granule preparation was administered to 33 pediatric patients with ages between 1 to 13 years with various infections, and its clinical effects, bacteriological effects and safety were assessed. In 31 of the 33 patients (2 patients were excluded since they were with non-bacterial infections) clinical effects were excellent in all of 9 patients with scarlet fever (3), acute pharyngitis (3) or impetigo (3), excellent in 12 and good in 3 of 15 patients with acute purulent tonsillitis, and excellent in 4 and good in 3 of 7 patients with acute pneumonia. The overall efficacy rate was 100%. Bacteriological effects against causative organisms were evaluated. All the identified Staphylococcus aureus (4 strains) and Streptococcus agalactiae (1) were eradicated. Of 10 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 9 strains were eradicated and the other one was reduced. Of 7 strains of Haemophilus influenzae 4 were eradicated, 1 persisted and the fate of the remaining 2 were unknown. The overall eradication rate was 90.0%. Microbial substitutions were observed in 5 patients. The new, replacing bacteria were all Haemophilus spp.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity of sparfloxacin (CI-978, AT-4140, and PD 131501). A quinolone with high activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Sparfloxacin (CI-978, AT-4140 and PD 131501) is a new antimicrobial agent of the  piperazinyl quinolone class. Relative to other quinolones, it is a potent antistaphylococcal and antistreptococcal drug in vitro: The microbroth 90% minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) (in microgram/ml) was 0.25 vs 26 methicillin-resistant and -sensitive coagulase-positive and -negative staphylococci and 20 Streptococcus pneumoniae; 0.5 vs 20 strains each of S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, and Enterococcus faecalis. The data indicate sparfloxacin to be generally superior to ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, oxacillin, cefazolin, doxycycline, amikacin, and vancomycin against these Gram-positive bacterial groups. Additional MIC90s were determined for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (less than or equal to 0.03); Enterobacteriaceae (0.5); and Listeria monocytogenes (1). Activity was generally unchanged with light, 50% human serum, aerobic-anaerobic atmosphere, 5% sodium cholate, cation supplementation, and 100-fold increased or decreased inoculum; as with other quinolones, potency was measurably diminished with decreasing pH (pH less than or equal to 6.0) and in 100% urine. Naturally occurring resistant mutants occurred at frequencies of 10(-8) or lower.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefpodoxime, a new oral cephalosporin, compared with that of nine other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the compound RU-51746, the sodium salt of cefpodoxime (which is administered orally as the ester cefpodoxime proxetil) was compared with that of other commonly used oral antibiotics against a selection of clinical isolates of common bacteria from patients with urinary tract, soft tissue and respiratory tract infections. RU-51746 was found to inhibit 90% of Enterobacteriaceae at less than 1 mg/l; pneumococci, pyogenic streptococci (Lancefield groups A, C and G) and Streptococcus agalactiae were almost all inhibited by concentrations of less than 0.06 mg/l; Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producers) were inhibited by less than 1 mg/l; 90% of Branhamella catarrhalis were inhibited at less than 2 mg/l. Activity against Acinetobacter spp. and staphylococci was variable and enterococci were all resistant.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on cefpirome in pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpirome (HR 810, CPR), a new cephem antibiotic, was investigated for its experimental and clinical studies in pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Plasma and urinary levels of CPR were determined in 2 children (age 5 and 7 years) after the one shot intravenous injection of the drug at 20 mg/kg. Average plasma levels of the drug were 44.7 micrograms/ml, 28.5 micrograms/ml, 10.5 micrograms/ml, 4.6 micrograms/ml and 1.5 micrograms/ml at 1/2 hour, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours and 6 hours, respectively, and the average half life was 1.57 hours. Average urinary levels of the drug were 1,785 micrograms/ml, 545 micrograms/ml and 198 micrograms/ml at 0-2 hours, 2-4 hours, 4-6 hours, respectively and the average urinary elimination rate was 52.0%. The results were nearly equivalent to those in adults except for urinary elimination rate which tended to be slightly lower than that in adults. 2. Cerebrospinal fluid levels in 3 cases of purulent meningitis treated with CPR were investigated. Cerebrospinal fluid levels in a case of Neisseria meningitidis were 11.5-23.1 micrograms/ml at 1 hour and 0.94 microgram/ml at 5 hours after intravenous injection of 44.4 mg/kg, 4 times a day. Cerebrospinal fluid levels in a case of Streptococcus pneumoniae were 1.01-4.23 micrograms/ml at 1 hour after intravenous injection of 49.0 mg/kg, 6 times a day, and in the other case with Streptococcus pneumoniae, the levels were 16.8-37.1 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, 11.3 and 3.60 micrograms/ml at 3 and 4 hours after intravenous injection 52.2 mg/kg, 6 times a day. These results are not inferior to those with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. These levels appear to be higher than MIC90 values against Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae which are the major pathogens of these diseases. 3. CPR was given to 62 patients and clinical efficacy, bacteriological response and adverse reactions were evaluated. Evaluated cases for clinical efficacy included 3 cases of purulent meningitis, 1 case of acute purulent otitis media, 2 cases of acute purulent tonsillitis, 1 case of acute bronchitis, 49 cases of acute pneumoniae, 1 case of scarlet fever, 1 case of acute osteomyelitis, 1 case of acute enterocolitis, and 2 cases of acute UTI, totalling 61 cases. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 38 cases, good in 22 cases and fair in 1 case with an efficacy rete of 98.4% (excellent + good).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of the fluoroquinolones PD 117596, PD 124816, and PD 127391.
AB  - Three new aminopyrrolidine-substituted fluorocyclopropyl quinolones--PD 117596, PD 124816, and PD 127391--were tested for in vitro antibacterial activity against 349 bacterial strains, which are primarily clinical isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) in micrograms/ml required for greater than or equal to 90% of strains were 0.03-0.06 for staphylococci (26 strains); 0.06-0.25 for Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis (80); less than or equal to 0.015 for Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (42); 0.06 for Enterobacteriaceae (97); 0.125-0.25 for Acinetobacter spp. (14); 0.5 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20); 0.125-1.0 for Bacteroides fragilis (13); and 0.25-0.5 for anaerobic cocci (11). These activities were generally superior to that of ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ampicillin, penicillin G, oxacillin, cefazolin, ceftazidime, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, aztreonam, piperacillin, amikacin, spectinomycin, doxycycline, erythomycin, clindamycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin. The activities of the new quinolones were generally unchanged with light, 50% human serum, aerobic/anaerobic atmosphere, 5% sodium choate, cation supplementation, and 100-fold increased or decreased inoculum; as with other quinolones, potency was measurably diminished with decreasing pH (pH less than or equal to 6.0) and in 100% urine.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefpirome in the field  of pediatrics].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized below. 1. Antibacterial activities of CPR against clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae were superior to those of ceftazidime. 2. Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of CPR at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 2 cases each were determined. Mean peak plasma concentrations of CPR at these dose levels were 33.9, 62.9 and 96.0 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes with plasma half-lives of 1.58, 1.69, and 2.13 hours, respectively. Mean cumulative urinary excretion rates in the first 8 hours after administration were 51.2, 78.0 and 74.9%, respectively. 3. Ten patients with bacterial infections (pneumonia 5 cases, urinary tract infection 5 cases) were treated with CPR at a daily dose of 16-79 mg/kg/day. The overall clinical efficacy and bacteriological eradication rates were both 100%. 4. No adverse reactions were observed except in 1 case of mild pain in blood vessels. Abnormal laboratory test results were also mild, slight elevation of GOT, GPT and thrombocytosis in 1 case and eosinophilia in 1 case.
TI  - The relationship of tonsil bacterial concentration to surface and core cultures in chronic tonsillar disease in children.
AB  - Fifty-five tonsils removed for chronic tonsillar disease (chronic tonsillitis and obstructive tonsillar hyperplasia) underwent surface swab and quantitative core cultures in order to identify the relationship between core bacterial concentration and the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsil surface. The accuracy of a single core culture was further established by quantitative cultures of 9 sections per tonsil in an additional 19 tonsils. The results indicate that many (61.5%) but not all aerobic bacteria which were found in the tonsil core were cultured from the surface of the tonsil. Conversely, the tonsil core bacteria with the highest bacterial concentrations are more likely to be present on the tonsillar surface and the greater the bacterial concentration, the more likely the bacteria are to be found in most if not all areas of the tonsil core. Therefore, the core bacterial concentration appears to be related to the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsillar surface. Surface bacteria may not, however, be truly representative of the core bacterial environment. Implications for the management of chronic tonsillar disease will be discussed.
TI  - Performance of a BACTEC nonradiometric medium for pediatric blood cultures.
AB  - A BACTEC aerobic nonradiometric medium, PEDS Plus, designed for diagnosis of pediatric bacteremia was evaluated in three hospital centers. Equivalent blood volumes (up to 5 ml) were inoculated into and incubated in BACTEC NR-6A (6A) and PEDS Plus broths. Among 4,581 compliant sets, 289 clinically significant organisms, representing more than 20 bacterial and two Candida species, were isolated. One hundred eighty-one isolates were recovered in both bottles, 75 in PEDS Plus only, and 33 in 6A only (P less than 0.001). Time to detection when both bottles were positive was the same for 129 isolates, detection with PEDS Plus was earlier for 39, and detection with 6A was earlier for 13 (P less than 0.005). Staphylococcus aureus was recovered significantly more often in PEDS Plus than in 6A (P less than 0.01), and more coagulase-negative staphylococci and pediatric pathogens (pneumococci, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus agalactiae) were recovered in PEDS Plus than in 6A. Coagulase-negative staphylococci and H. influenzae were detected significantly earlier in PEDS Plus (P less than 0.05 and less than 0.01, respectively). When the eight species of the family Enterobacteriaceae isolated were considered together, recovery in PEDS Plus was better than in 6A (P less than 0.05). For 66 of the 143 isolates from patients known to be on antimicrobial therapy at the time blood was drawn, PEDS Plus was superior to 6A. In 45 cases, organisms were isolated from PEDS Plus only (P less than 0.001) and in 21 cases they were isolated from PEDS Plus before 6A (P less than 0.01). PEDS Plus broth aids diagnosis of pediatric bacteremia by increasing recovery of etiologic agents and decreasing the time required for detection.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of PD 131628, a new 1,8-naphthyridine anti-infective agent.
AB  - PD 131628 is a new aminopyrrolidine-substituted fluorocyclopropyl naphthyridine quinolone which possesses high in vitro activity against a wide spectrum of bacterial species. The MICs for greater than or equal to 90% of strains were 0.125 to 0.25 microgram/ml for staphylococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, and S. pneumoniae; 0.5 micrograms/ml for S. agalactiae and Enterococcus faecalis; 0.125 micrograms/ml for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter spp.; 0.5 micrograms/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and less than or equal to 0.03 micrograms/ml for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In these in vitro comparisons with ciprofloxacin, PD 131628 is more active against gram-positive organisms, approximately equivalent against gram-negative organisms, and, like most other quinolones, relatively inactive against gram-negative anaerobes. In most instances, the in vitro potency of PD 131628 exceeded those of widely used compounds: ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ampicillin, penicillin G, oxacillin, cefazolin, ceftazidime, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, aztreonam, piperacillin, amikacin, spectinomycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of ceftibuten against multiply-resistant microorganisms from Belgium.
AB  - To study the activity of ceftibuten, we obtained multiply-resistant isolates from approximately 20 hospitals in Belgium. Against Enterobacteriaceae, all of the tested comparative compounds were more active than cefaclor, and ceftibuten and tigemonam were the most active of the agents tested. Ceftibuten MIC50s were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml for most enteric bacilli species and 85% of strains were susceptible (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml). This level of activity compared favorably to that recorded for cefaclor (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml), cefetamet (less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml), and cefteram (less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml), that is, 37%, 69%, and 59%, respectively. Ceftibuten, cefetamet, cefteram, and tigemonam were highly active against isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. None of the comparative agents were as active as cefaclor against staphylococcal isolates. Against streptococci, cefteram was the most active, and tigemonam the least active of the agents. The MIC90s of ceftibuten for strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were 2 micrograms/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively. Strains of Streptococcus agalactiae were resistant to both ceftibuten and tigemonam; cefaclor and cefteram inhibited 100% of isolates of this species. Strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were consistently resistant to all of the compounds. Overall, ceftibuten exhibited potent activity against many multiply-resistant clinical isolates.
TI  - Cefixime shows good effects on group A and group B beta-haemolytic streptococci.
AB  - There is continued interest in the development of oral beta-lactam compounds, which can be used clinically to treat various bacterial infections, particularly those caused by beta-haemolytic streptococci. Cefixime is a new orally active cephalosporin, with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, including Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Cefixime is highly resistant to hydrolysis by most beta-lactamases. In this study the authors examined the effects of this molecule on Group A and Group B beta-haemolytic streptococci, recently isolated from clinical specimens in the authors' laboratory. MICs and the growth curves of 36 strains of Group A streptococci and the effects of sub-MICs on buccal cell adhesion were evaluated. The results show that concerning the sub-MIC cefixime effect on streptococci adherence, the treatment led to a decrease in adherence to the cells of the strains studied. Moreover cefixime showed good activity with 86.1% of the strains with MIC less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml, and the growth curves demonstrated that the molecule possesses a bactericidal effect after 3 h. Concerning Group B streptococci, 70.3% of the strains showed a MIC less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. In conclusion cefixime demonstrates good activity on beta-haemolytic streptococci, particularly those of Group A.
TI  - Use of rapid, nonradioactive DNA probes in culture confirmation tests to detect Streptococcus agalactiae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Enterococcus spp. from pediatric patients with significant infections.
AB  - Acridinium ester-labeled, chemiluminescent DNA probe tests (Accuprobe; Gen-Probe, Inc.) for culture confirmation of Streptococcus agalactiae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Enterococcus spp. were compared with conventional identification techniques. The probe is a DNA oligomer that is a complementary to the RNA of the target. The DNA-RNA hybrids are measured in a luminometer. The 40-min assay requires one reaction tube and the addition of three reagents. When two colonies were used to add a sample of the reaction tube, 325 of 327 isolates were detected by the probe. Isolates of 404 nonprobe target organisms did not hybridize with the probe.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in the United States, 1986: report of a multistate surveillance study. The Bacterial Meningitis Study Group.
AB  - A prospective, laboratory-based surveillance project obtained accurate data on meningitis in a population of 34 million people during 1986. Haemophilus influenzae was the most common cause of bacterial meningitis (45%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (18%), and Neisseria meningitidis (14%). Rates of H. influenzae meningitis varied significantly by region, from 1.9/100,000 in New Jersey to 4.0/100,000 in Washington state. The overall case fatality rates for meningitis were lower than those reported in several studies from the early 1970s, suggesting that improvements in early detection and antibiotic treatment may have occurred since that time. Concurrent surveillance was also performed for all invasive disease due to the five most common causes of bacterial meningitis. Serotypes of group B streptococcus other than type III caused more than half of neonatal group B streptococcal disease and mortality, suggesting that an optimal vaccine preparation must be multivalent. Of the organisms evaluated, group B streptococcus was the second most common cause of invasive disease in persons greater than 5 years old.
TI  - In-vitro activity of cefpodoxime against pathogens responsible for community-acquired respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of cefpodoxime, the active compound of the ester prodrug, cefpodoxime proxetil, was compared with that of other antibiotics. The susceptibility of bacterial isolates from patients with respiratory tract infections was determined by an agar dilution method. The MIC90s of cefpodozime for ampicillin-sensitive and beta-lactamase-producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae were 0.12 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively; the MIC90s for ampicillin-resistant non-beta-lactamase-producing strains was 1 mg/l. Time-kill curves of cefpodoxime against ampicillin-sensitive and ampicillin-resistant beta-lactamase producing strains showed a time-dependent bactericidal activity. The MIC90s for ampicillin-sensitive and ampicillin-resistant Branhamella catarrhalis were 0.50 and 1 mg/l, respectively. The MIC90s for penicillin-sensitive pneumococci, beta-haemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.06, 0.06 and 0.12 mg/l, respectively. The inhibitory activity against penicillin-resistant pneumococci was limited: the MIC90 was 4 mg/l.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - Opsonic effect of jacalin and human immunoglobulin A on type II group B streptococci.
AB  - This study examined the effect of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and the IgA-binding lectin jacalin on the phagocytosis of type II group B streptococci (GBS). Strains possessing the trypsin-sensitive and trypsin-resistant components of the c protein (II/c) and type II GBS lacking the c protein (II) were examined by radiolabeled bacterial uptake, bactericidal assays, and electron microscopy. Type II/c GBS resisted phagocytosis by monocytes (4.9% +/- 0.8% uptake, mean +/- SE, n = 25) compared with type II GBS (8.5% +/- 1.4% uptake, n = 14, P = 0.03). Phagocytic killing by polymorphonuclear leukocytes was also less for the type II/c strain 78-471 than for the type II strain 79-176 (68% +/- 5% versus 86% +/- 4% reduction in CFU at 45 min, P = 0.03). IgA binding did not explain the resistance of type II/c GBS to phagocytosis. The uptake of type II/c GBS was not significantly different after opsonization in cord sera lacking endogenous IgA (5.93% +/- 1.4%) than in the same cord sera after addition of exogenous IgA (5.48% +/- 1.4%, P = 0.69, n = 9). Attempts to remove serum IgA with the IgA-binding lectin jacalin resulted in the binding of IgA-jacalin complexes to II/c GBS. This combination of nonspecific IgA and jacalin increased uptake of II/c GBS from 4.9% +/- 0.8% to 11.8% +/- 1.9% (P = 0.002). Jacalin also combined with specific, immune, monoclonal IgA bound to the surface of Haemophilus influenzae and promoted the uptake of these bacteria. Jacalin and IgA mediated phagocytosis of II/c GBS via receptors that were not dependent on divalent cations and that were not modulated by plating monocytes on antigen-antibody complexes.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Therapeutic studies of cefepime (BMY 28142) in murine meningitis and pharmacokinetics in neonatal rats.
AB  - Cefepime (BMY 28142) was compared with ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and moxalactam for efficacy in treating experimental meningitis in mice and neonatal rats. Mice were infected intracranially with Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and treated intramuscularly. Five- to eight-day-old neonatal rats were injected intracisternally with Haemophilus influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and S. agalactiae and treated intraperitoneally. Cefepime was found to be the most active compound against induced meningitis in mice infected with S. agalactiae. Cefepime was as active as cefotaxime against Staphylococcus aureus meningitis, slightly more active than cefotaxime against S. pneumoniae and E. coli, and as active as ceftazidime against K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa meningitis. Cefepime was found to be the most active compound against S. pneumoniae and S. agalactiae meningitis in neonatal rats. Against H. influenzae, cefepime was as active as moxalactam and cefotaxime. Ceftazidime was the least active compound. The pharmacokinetics of cefepime in neonatal rats were similar to those of ceftazidime. Both compounds penetrated well into cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissues of uninfected neonatal rats. Relative concentrations were twice as high as those of cefotaxime and moxalactam.
TI  - Sensorineural hearing loss in children recovered from purulent meningitis: a study in Thai children at Ramathibodi Hospital.
AB  - Hearing loss is one of the serious complications of bacterial meningitis. Conventional audiometry and auditory brainstem response (ABR) methods were used to detect this complication in eighteen children who recovered from bacterial meningitis treated at Ramathibodi Hospital from January 1983 to December 1987. Six patients (33%) were found to have persistent bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Among them, the causes of meningitis were: Hemophilus influenzae (3 patients), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 patient), Streptococcus agalactiae (1 patient) and Escherichia coli (1 patient). Various clinical and demographic factors were examined in relation to the hearing loss, but no significant correlation was observed. Since meningitis often affects small children and makes conventional audiometry tests difficult, ABR was found to be a more effective method for testing this group of patients.
TI  - Polyvalent group B streptococcal immune globulin for intravenous administration:  overview.
AB  - Immunoglobulin therapy is becoming an important modality for the prevention and treatment of bacterial and viral infection. Standard intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is made from large pools of plasma obtained from normal blood donors. However, lot-to-lot variation in titers of antibody to specific microbial pathogens may diminish therapeutic efficacy. Since group B Streptococcus (GBS) is an important neonatal pathogen, a preparation with high titers of activity against GBS was prepared and studied. Plasma was obtained from volunteers immunized with a polyvalent GBS vaccine and was processed by the Swiss Red Cross for intravenous infusion. This high-titered GBS intravenous immunoglobulin (GBS-IVIG) was shown to be superior both in vitro and in vivo to standard IVIG. GBS-IVIG provided protection when therapy was delayed for up to 24 hours after infection. Standard IVIG did not protect animals against all GBS strains. However, GBS-IVIG enhanced survival from infection with all strains tested, even when the challenge dose of GBS was increased by 2 log units. Specific hyperimmune globulins to pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae have also been studied. Immunization of adult volunteers as a means of obtaining hyperimmune globulin appears to be an effective method of producing high-titered pathogen-specific preparations of IVIG.
TI  - Bacterial counts in cerebrospinal fluid of children with meningitis.
AB  - Eighty-five cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from the same number of pediatric patients with meningitis were examined to determine the bacterial count and the relationship of this count to the microscopy results, the ages of the patients and the bacterial species isolated. Bacterial counts ranged from 2 x 10 to 4 x 10(9) CFU/ml CSF. Twenty-five percent of the 85 CSF specimens positive for Haemophilus influenzae type b, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli K1 and group B streptococci had counts of 10(7) CFU/ml or higher. Children between 1 and 6 months of age had significantly higher counts (p less than 0.05) than the other age groups. The three patients who had positive CSF cultures 24 h after the start of therapy all had initial bacterial counts of 10(7) CFU/ml or higher. The detection limit for Gram stain/microscopy was 10(5) CFU/ml. No correlation was found between bacterial count and the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
TI  - Short course single daily ceftriaxone monotherapy for acute bacterial meningitis  in children: results of a Swiss multicenter study. Part II: Bacteriological results.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftriaxone, ampicillin and chloramphenicol was studied  at a reference laboratory against the isolates of the first 33 patients enrolled in a pediatric Swiss Multicenter Meningitis Study. The predictive value of the MIC data of 31 of the strains was further corroborated by two sets of bacterial killing curves in broth supplemented with 2 g/l of albumin. Ceftriaxone had the lowest geometric mean MIC values against all groups of isolates except for ampicillin against Streptococcus agalactiae. The bactericidal activity of ceftriaxone and that of ampicillin, alone and in combination with chloramphenicol, was compared at six times the respective MICs and at pharmacologically readily achievable concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid. The bactericidal power of ceftriaxone at six times the MIC was as good or better than that of ampicillin alone or in combination against Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae despite the very low drug concentrations of ceftriaxone compared to that of the competitors; and it was barely lower at six times the MIC and at 1 mg/l (a level that is readily surpassed in CSF at the 24 h trough level after a single daily dose of ceftriaxone of 100 mg/kg (neonates 50 mg/kg) than that of ampicillin and chloramphenicol at much higher concentrations against Haemophilus influenzae type b.
TI  - Central nervous system complications associated with acute otitis media in children.
AB  - The purpose of this article is to review a subset of pediatric patients with otitis media occurring simultaneously with meningitis and other central nervous system diseases. Of the 92 cases reviewed, 61.3% involved patients under 12 months of age. Meningitis associated with otitis media involved 91% of the patients; the remainder had nonmeningitic central involvement. The most striking finding was the high incidence of Haemophilus influenza type-B, a relatively uncommon pathogen of the middle ear. This finding highlights the need to select antibiotic coverage to adequately treat Haemophilus influenza type-B.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FK482, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin with a C-3 vinyl group. Its activity was compared with those of cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. FK482 inhibited 90% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates at 1 micrograms/ml and 90% of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates at less than or equal to 0.012 micrograms/ml, superior to cephalexin and cefuroxime and similar to cefixime. It did not inhibit oxacillin-resistant S. aureus. FK482 inhibited 90% of Enterococcus faecalis isolates at 8 micrograms/ml. Although 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, and Shigella species isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, FK482 was less active than cefixime against Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Morganella, Serratia, and Providencia species, with MICs for many isolates of greater than 8 micrograms/ml. FK482 inhibited Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations comparable to that of cefixime and superior to those of cephalexin and cfaclor. Bacteroides and Pseudomonas species were resistant. FK482 was not hydrolyzed by the TEM-1 and TEM-2 beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the Proteus vulgaris enzyme. It had a high affinity for chromosomal beta-lactamases.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefteram pivoxil granule in the pediatric field].
AB  - Cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI), the pivaloyloxymethyl ester of cefteram (CFTM) in which aminothiazol was also introduced into the 7 position of cephem nucleus, is a new oral cephem antibiotic. CFTM-PI was absorbed through the intestines and hydrolyzed to CFTM by esterases in the intestinal wall and existed in the body fluids as CFTM. A tablet form of this drug has been released in Japan and now a granular form for pediatric patients has been developed. We have determined MICs of 5 drugs (CFTM, cephalexin (CEX), cefaclor (CCL), ampicillin (ABPC), erythromycin (EM], against stock strains and MICs of 6 drugs (CFTM, CEX, CCL, ABPC, methicillin, cloxacillin) against fresh strains from patients received to CFTM-PI, with an inoculum size of 10(6) cfu/ml. A total of 149 strains included Gram-positive cocci i.e. Staphylococcus aureus (11), Streptococcus pyogenes (85), Streptococcus agalactiae (16) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (4), and Gram-negative rods i.e. Haemophilus influenzae (11), Bordetella pertussis (11), Escherichia coli (9), Proteus mirabilis (1) and Morganella morganii (1). The granular form of CFTM-PI was administered to 9 boys (age: 8 years 3 months approximately 10 years 10 months) to determine serum and urinary concentrations of the drug and its urinary recovery rates using bioassay. Doses of 1.5, 3.0 and 6.0 mg/kg were given orally 30 minutes after meal to 3 boys, respectively. Urinary concentrations and its urinary recovery rates of T-2525A, a main metabolite of CFTM, were determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). To study clinical and bacteriological effects of this drug, a mean daily dose of 3.3 mg/kg divided 3-4 times a day (3 times: 133 cases, 4 times: 9 cases) was administered for 8 days on the average to a total of 142 cases with pharyngitis (22), tonsillitis (12), acute bronchitis (3), pneumonia (11), pleurisy (1), scarlet fever (28), acute purulent otitis media (16), impetigo (13), abscess (2), purulent lymphadenitis (1) and urinary tract infection (33). Adverse reactions and abnormal effects on laboratory test values attributable to this drug were studied in patients. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. With regard to Gram-positive cocci, MICs of CFTM against 11 fresh strains of S. aureus ranged from 3.13 to 6.25 micrograms/ml except for 1 strain, thus CFTM was equally effective to CEX, but less active than the other drugs tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil dry syrup in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, CS-807) is a new oral cephem derivative drug in which carboxylic acid was esterified to the 4-position of CPDX (oxime type cephem antibiotic). CPDX-PR is hydrolyzed mainly with esterase in intestinal wall and CPDX exists as an active form in body fluid. While there are numerous study reports using CPDX-PR in tablet forms in Japan, the dry syrup formula for pediatric use was newly developed. The dry syrup of CPDX-PR was orally administered 20 minutes after meal to the 6 boys of ages from 8 years and 1 month to 10 years and 10 months, with doses of 3 and 6 mg/kg, respectively, for 3 cases each. Serum concentrations and urinary concentrations and recovery rate of the drug were investigated. In addition to the above, the clinical and bacteriological studies were performed in a total of 105 cases consisting of children with ages ranging from 2 months to 11 years and 8 months, upon administering an average dose of 3.4 mg/kg, 3 to 4 times per day (96 cases of 3 times and 9 cases of 4 times). The 105 cases included 13 cases of pharyngitis, 21 cases of tonsillitis, 4 cases of acute bronchitis, 6 cases of pneumonia, 1 case of pleurisy, 13 cases of scarlet fever, 41 cases of urinary tract infection, 3 cases of posthitis and 3 cases of bacillary dysentery. Drug sensitivity test was performed for the following strains: (i) Strains retained by our department; 52 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 18 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, and 11 strains of Bordetella pertussis, and (ii) strains isolated from cases to which CPDX-PR was administered; 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 8 strains of S. pyogenes, 2 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 10 strains of Escherichia coli, and 1 strain of Proteus mirabilis. Drug sensitivities of the strains retained by our department were tested with the inoculum sizes of 10(8) and 10(6) cfu/ml for R-3746 (Na-salt of CPDX), cefaclor (CCL), cephalexin (CEX), amoxicillin (AMPC), and methicillin (DMPPC), and those against strains separated from the cases to which CPDX-PR was administered were tested with the same inoculum sizes for R-3746, CCL, CEX, cefadroxil, ampicillin (ABPC), DMPPC and cloxacillin (MCIPC). Adverse reactions and abnormal clinical laboratory test results were also examined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical and pharmacokinetic study on cefodizime, a new cephalosporin antibiotic, in the pediatric infections].
AB  - Cefodizime (THR-221, CDZM), a new cephalosporin antibiotic, was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in 27 children with various bacterial infections. The episodes of infections included pneumonia (6 cases), bronchopneumonia (11 cases), lung abscess (1 case), acute pharyngitis (2 cases), cervical lymphadenitis (1 case), infected cephalohematoma (1 case), urinary tract infection (1 case), sepsis (2 cases) and purulent meningitis (2 cases). CDZM was effective in all but one, and its efficacy rate was 96.3%. The main etiologic pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii and Branhamella catarrhalis. The elimination rate was 92.3%. As adverse reactions or abnormalities, diarrhea was encountered in 4 cases. A slight elevation of serum transaminases or eosinophils was observed in 4 cases. The serum half-life was approximately 1.8-1.9 hours in children after intravenous bolus injections. Concentrations of CDZM in cerebrospinal fluids were well above MIC values of CDZM against those organisms responsible for the infections. The data suggest that CDZM is a safe and effective antibiotic when used in children with bacterial infections including purulent meningitis.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on imipenem/cilastatin sodium in neonates].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) were performed in neonates. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Plasma levels and urinary excretion of IPM and CS sodium were determined in 7 neonates with ages between 7 and 26 days (gestation periods were 37 to 41 weeks and birth weights were 2,410 to 3,890 g) upon 1 hour drip intravenous infusion of IPM/CS at 10 mg/10 mg/kg, or 20 mg/20 mg/kg. Mean plasma concentrations of IPM reached their peaks at the end of infusion with levels of 12.7 +/- 3.0 micrograms/ml for the group given 10 mg/10 mg/kg, and 19.1 +/- 4.1 micrograms/ml for 20 mg/20 mg/kg. The concentration of IPM in plasma showed a dose-response to the 10 mg/10 mg/kg and 20 mg/20 mg/kg dosages. Concentrations decreased with half-lives of 1.87 +/- 0.71 hours and 1.97 +/- 0.21 hours for the low and the high dosages, and plasma levels at 8 hours after administration were 0.3 +/- 0.1 microgram/ml and 0.8 +/- 0.3 microgram/ml, respectively. Mean urinary recovery rates in 8 hours after administration were 37.6 +/- 11.8% and 26.8 +/- 17.2% for the low and the high dosages. While, mean plasma concentrations and mean urinary recovery rates of CS were higher than those of IPM, mean plasma half-lives of CS were similar to IPM. 2. IPM/CS was administered to 11 neonatal patients (with ages between 1 and 26 days) of various bacterial infections, and clinical effectiveness, bacteriological efficacy and adverse reactions were evaluated. Clinical efficacies in cases including 7 with acute pneumonia and 1 each with suspected septicemia, intrauterine infection, acute urinary tract infection and periproctal abscess were judged excellent in 10 and good in 1 case, and the efficacy rate was 100%. Causative organisms isolated from these patients included 3 strains of Escherichia coli and 1 strain each of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae Enterococcus faecalis and Haemophilus influenzae. All the organisms were eradicated by IPM/CS, thus the bacteriological eradication rate was 100%. No adverse reactions were observed, but decreased platelet in 1 patient and increased GOT in 2 patients were found as abnormal laboratory test values. These changes, however were transient, and returned to normal after discontinuation of IPM/CS. It was concluded that the clinical results of IPM/CS are indicative of excellent efficacy, safety and usefulness of the drug in the treatment of infections in neonates.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - Cerebrospinal fluid alpha-1-antitrypsin alpha-1-antitrypsin-elastase complex levels in meningitis.
AB  - Alpha-1-antitrypsin (A-1-AT) and A-1-AT-elastase complex levels in cerebrospinal  fluid have been evaluated in 11 children with viral meningitis (VM), 14 with bacterial meningitis (BM), 10 with tuberculous meningitis (TBM) and 10 investigated for, but found not to have meningitis (NM). A-1-AT concentrations in the NM group were lower than in the BM group (P = 0.0002) and the TBM group (P = 0.0005) but did not differ from the concentrations in VM; those in the VM group were lower than in the BM group (P = 0.0001) and the TBM group (P = 0.003) but no difference was found between the BM and TBM groups. A-1-AT-elastase complex concentrations in CSF were lower in the NM group than the BM group (P = 0.0001) or the TBM group (P = 0.0089), however those in the BM group were significantly higher than in the TBM group (P = 0.0001). A significant correlation existed in CSF between the protein concentrations and neutrophil counts as well as the A-1-AT and A-1-AT-elastase complex concentrations.
TI  - [Loading of polystyrene solid phases with microbial agents and their polysaccharide antigens for the screening of monoclonal antibodies].
AB  - Before screening monoclonal antibodies using enzyme immuno assays, it is necessary to prove that the coating of the solid phases occurs efficiently. The adhesion of whole cells of group B streptococci, Escherichia coli K1, Haemophilus influenzae type b and Candida albicans as well as B-Streptococcus group antigen, H. influenzae type b capsular antigen, and C. albicans cell wall antigen to polystyrene solid phases was studied and detected by the following methods: Peroxidase competition procedure, scintillation measurement of 32phosphate-labelled germs, and reactions with monoclonal antibodies.
TI  - [Bacterial meningitis. Study from 1970 to 1988 at the Regina Margherita Children's Hospital in Turin].
AB  - From 1970 to 1988, 330 cases of bacterial meningitis were diagnosed at the Children's Hospital Regina Margherita of Turin. Neisseria meningitidis was the most frequent cause of bacterial meningitis (45%); meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae increased from 4% in 1970-1983 to 19% in 1984-1988, and meningitis with pathogen unknown decreased from 28% in 1970-1983 to 7% in 1984-1988. The neonatal meningitis in 1984-1988 were caused by Streptococcus B in 90% of cases.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies of sultamicillin fine granule in pediatric field].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on sultamicillin (SBTPC) fine granule were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Antibacterial activities of SBTPC against clinically isolated strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Escherichia coli were compared with those of ampicillin (ABPC). SBTPC was superior to ABPC especially against beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae, E. coli, S. aureus, and B. catarrhalis. 2. Serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates of sulbactam (SBT) and ABPC after administration of SBTPC fine granule at a dose level of 10 mg/kg in 2 cases were determined. Mean half-lives of SBT and ABPC in the serum following oral administration were about 1.33 and 1.61 hours respectively. Mean urinary recovery rates of SBT and ABPC in 6 hours after oral administration at a dose of 10 mg/kg were 58.7% and 49.6% respectively. 3. SBTPC fine granule was administered to 20 pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (pneumonia 8 cases, bronchitis 2, pharyngitis 2, tonsillitis 4, subcutaneous abscess 1 and urinary tract infection 3). The overall clinical efficacy rate was 100% and the overall bacteriological eradication rate was 75%. 4. No adverse reactions were observed except 1 case of loose stool. No abnormal laboratory test values were observed. These results indicate the usefulness of SBTPC fine granule in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - [Microbiological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of rokitamycin dry syrup in the pediatric field].
AB  - Rokitamycin (RKM), a newly developed macrolide antibiotic with a 16-membered ring, dissolves well under acidic conditions. It has been improved over other macrolides to minimize individual variations in its absorbability. We measured, using the GA-test, variations in gastric acidities of 43 children with ages between 1 to 14 years, and investigated the relationship between gastric acidities and pharmacokinetic values. Also activities (expressed in MICs) of antimicrobial agents were studied against clinically isolated 229 bacterial strains using an inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml. Tested organisms included Streptococcus pyogenes (77 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (29), Streptococcus pneumoniae (2), as Gram-positive cocci, and Haemophilus influenzae (1), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (1), Bordetella pertussis (12), Salmonella sp. (4) and Campylobacter jejuni (103) as Gram-negative bacilli. Against stock strains of bacteria, MICs of 10 drugs (RKM, erythromycin (EM), josamycin (JM), midecamycin (MDM), midecamycin acetate (MOM), clindamycin (CLDM), amoxicillin (AMPC), cefaclor (CCL), minocycline, ofloxacin (OFLX] were determined. Against isolates from patients who underwent treatment with RKM, MICs of only 4 drugs (RKM, EM, JM, MOM) were determined. Measurements were made on plasma and urinary concentrations of RKM and its urinary recovery rates after patients including 6 boys with ages between 5 years 1 month and 11 years 6 months were administered with RKM (dry syrup). Two groups of 6 boys were administered between meals with RKM at dose levels of 5 and 10 mg/kg, respectively. Clinical and bacteriological effects of RKM were evaluated for 175 patients including 5 cases of pharyngitis, 3 tonsillitis, 32 pneumonia, 17 mycoplasmal pneumonia, 34 atypical pneumonia, 28 streptococcal infections, 29 Campylobacter enteritis, 4 Salmonella gastroenteritis, and 23 enteritis due to unknown organisms. Five drop-out cases were excluded from the evaluations. In the evaluable cases, an average dose level used was 31.8 mg/kg/day, with a daily dose divided into 3 to 4 administrations and with an average treatment duration of 9 days. Adverse reactions of RKM and its effects on laboratory test values were investigated in these patients including the drop out cases. Obtained results of these studies are summarized below. 1. The GA-test produced pH values indicating that amounts of gastric acid were mostly either normal or high in 42 of the 43 subjects tested (97.7%), and only one low acid case (2.3%) was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of a rokitamycin syrup in  pediatrics].
AB  - Rokitamycin (RKM) dry syrup was administered to a group of pediatric patients. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Of the recent isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes, fewer strains were highly resistant to RKM than to josamycin (JM), midecamycin (MDM), erythromycin and lincomycin. Also, macrolides (MLs)-resistant strains proved to be susceptible to RKM. 2. Recent isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, group G Streptococci, S. pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were more susceptible to RKM than to midecamycin acetate and JM. Oral administrations of 10-15 mg/kg of the drug were followed by its peak concentrations of 0.07-0.77 micrograms/ml in the blood at 30 minutes in many patients, and by an undetectable level at 6 hours also in many of them. T1/2 values were 1.2-2.6 hours, and first 6-hour urinary excretion rates were 1.26-1.74%. 3. Fifty-two patients with acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections, Campylobacter enteritis, etc. were treated with RKM at about 20-40 mg/kg daily for 4-14 days, with an overall efficacy rate of 88.5%. 4. An eradication rate of 81.4% was achieved for 43 strains of 7 species isolated from the patients. 5. No abnormal laboratory test values were observed after treatment with drug 4 approximately 14 days. A side effect, stomach discomfort, was observed in 1 patient.
TI  - In vitro activity of flomoxef in comparison to other cephalosporins.
AB  - Flomoxef and cefazolin had nearly the same activity against staphylococci, which  was stronger than that of other cephalosporins. Against Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, cefotaxime and cefazolin were more active than flomoxef, but the other cephamycins were less active than flomoxef. In comparison to the other cephalosporins, latamoxef and flomoxef had higher activity against Branhamella catarrhalis, whereas cefotaxime, latamoxef and cefotetan were more active against Haemophilus influenzae. Flomoxef was the only drug exhibiting activity against Clostridium difficile. The activity of flomoxef and latamoxef against Bacteroides fragilis was stronger than that of the other cephalosporins, but Bacteroides bivius was resistant to each of these antibiotics.
TI  - Latex agglutination test in the diagnosis of group B streptococcus and of haemophilus influenzae type B infections.
AB  
TI  - BMY-28100, a new oral cephalosporin: antimicrobial activity against nearly 7,000  recent clinical isolates, comparative potency with other oral agents, and activity against beta-lactamase producing isolates.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of BMY-28100 was tested against approximately 7,000 bacterial pathogens in a multicenter, multiphased collaborative investigation. The BMY-28100 spectrum and antimicrobial potency was most similar to that of cefaclor and superior to that of cephalexin among currently available cephalosporins. Species that had greater than or equal to 90% of clinical strains inhibited by BMY-28100 (less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml) were: Citrobacter diversus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus supp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. bovis, serogroup C and G streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes and gm-positive anaerobes. BMY-28100 inhibited 9% more of the 6286 fresh clinical isolates at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml than cefaclor at the same concentration. BMY-28100 was generally bactericidal, but MICs for some species were markedly increased when an inoculum concentration of 10(7) CFU/ml was used. Strains producing plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (TEM, OXA, SHV, HMS) were susceptible to BMY-28100, cefaclor, and cefuroxime. BMY-28100 was less active against strains producing chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases (Types I and IV). BMY-28100 was not hydrolyzed significantly by the tested plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but was destroyed by Type I cephalosporinases and Klebsiella K1 enzymes.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of erythromycin, vancomycin and pristinamycin.
AB  - We have studied the in-vitro activity of erythromycin, vancomycin and pristinamycin against 1,006 clinical isolates comprising streptococci, staphylococci, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae and anaerobes. In-vitro studies show pristinamycin to inhibit staphylococci and streptococci, including erythromycin highly-resistant organisms, at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. Although pristinamycin's mean MIC for streptococci is higher than that of erythromycin, pristinamycin is bactericidal, whereas erythromycin is bacteristatic against Streptococcus agalactiae and oral streptococci. Enterococci were less uniformly susceptible to pristinamycin: 58 of the 94 Enterococcus faecalis tested were resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 3.12 mg/l). 14 of the 15 isolates of Enterococcus faecium were inhibited by less than or equal to 1.56 mg/l pristinamycin. Pristinamycin showed poor activity against Haemophilus influenzae (mode MIC 1.56 and MIC90 of 3.12 mg/l) but all except two of the 100 Neisseria gonorrhoeae tested were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l pristinamycin. Pristinamycin inhibited all nine Clostridium spp. at less than or equal to 0.39 mg/l and 38 of 40 strains of anaerobic gram-positive cocci at less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. It was less effective against the Bacteroides fragilis group: (MIC90 3.12 mg/l). Pristinamycin had poor bactericidal activity against the anaerobes tested.
TI  - [The study of flomoxef in the pediatric field].
AB  - Flomoxef (FMOX; 6315-S), a new synthetic oxacephem antibiotic, was studied in the pediatric field and pharmacokinetic and clinical results obtained were summarized below. 1. The activity of FMOX against Staphylococcus aureus isolated from clinical patients, including latamoxef resistant strains was very high and MIC was approximately less than or equal to 0.39 microgram/ml. This MIC value was lower than other cephem antibiotics such as cefotaxime, cefotiam, cefmetazole, cefamandole. The distribution of MIC's of FMOX against Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. ranged from 0.05 to 0.78 microgram/ml and from 0.05 to 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. 2. Serum concentrations of FMOX after dosages of 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg with 1 hour intravenous drip infusion were 21.5-27.5 micrograms/ml, 6.00-7.81 micrograms/ml, 0.37-0.59 micrograms/ml at 1, 2, 5 hours after administration, respectively, and T1/2(beta) were 0.61-0.83 hour. Serum concentrations after one shot intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg FMOX were 56.7-90.2 and 0.20-0.26 micrograms/ml at 3-10 minutes and 6 hours after administration, respectively, T1/2(beta) was 1.22 hours and urinary excretion rate was 66.7-69.8% in 6 hours. 3. FMOX was administered to 32 cases (upper and lower respiratory tract infection, and purulent infections) at 3-4 times daily for 4-13 days. In these cases the daily dosage amounted to 41-119 mg/kg. Clinical effectiveness was 97% overall including resistance cases upon other cephem antibiotic treatment. All bacterial species identified including Branhamella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Haemophilus influenzae were eradicated upon the treatment with FMOX. 4. Only 3 cases of soft stool, 1 case of elevated GOT and GPT, and 1 case of elevated GPT were observed, and all of these adverse reactions were normalized after the completion of treatment.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 15-8074 and Ro 19-5247 in comparison to cefaclor and cefalexin.
AB  - 805 clinical isolates were investigated for their in vitro sensitivity against Ro 15-8074 and Ro 19-5247 in comparison to cefaclor and cefalexin in a serial dilution test on solid medium. Ro 19-5247 had the strongest activity of all drugs tested against streptococci (except Streptococcus faecalis) and was as active as cefaclor and cefalexin against most strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Ro 19-5247 was the only oral cephalosporin active against Bordetella pertussis. It was on average 160 times more active than cefaclor against Haemophilus influenzae. In its activity against enterobacteria Ro 19-5247 was always superior to cefaclor and cefalexin. Only a few strains of Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris and Serratia marcescens were resistant to Ro 19-5247 as were all strains of Enterobacter agglomerans and Klebsiella ozaenae. Ro 15-8074 was inactive against staphylococci but ten times more active than cefaclor and cefalexin against Streptococcus pyogenes. There was no difference in the activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus agalactiae. Against Haemophilus influenzae Ro 15-8074 acted 12 times stronger than cefaclor and 100 times stronger than cefalexin. The activity against enterobacteria corresponded to that of Ro 19-5247. Ro 15-8074 was also active against most strains of Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris which were resistant to cefaclor and cefalexin.
TI  - Activity of A-56268 compared with that of erythromycin and other oral agents against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - A-56268 was compared with erythromycin, roxithromycin (RU 28965), and perorally administered antimicrobial agents. Its in vitro activity was similar to that of erythromycin and slightly greater than that of roxithromycin, with beta-hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae inhibited by less than 2 micrograms of A-56268 per ml (50% inhibited by 0.06 microgram/ml). Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. Pneumoniae, and S. faecalis resistant to erythromycin were resistant to A-56268, and 4 micrograms/ml inhibited 90% of Haemophilus influenzae isolates.
TI  - Opsonic activity and composition of five intramuscular gammaglobulin preparations.
AB  - The opsonic activity of five immunoglobulin preparations for intramuscular and subcutaneous substitution therapy was investigated. Various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, group B streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were used. In addition, the concentration of unsplit IgG molecules, IgG fragments and IgG aggregates in these preparations was determined. With the exception of H. influenzae, all preparations opsonised the bacteria studied almost as well as inactivated serum. All preparations contained an appreciable amount of aggregates, but IgG fragments were not found.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in infants two to six weeks old.
AB  - We reviewed our experience with bacterial meningitis in older neonates (2 to 6 weeks of age) during a five-year period. Seventeen patients with bacterial meningitis were diagnosed and treated. Bacteria recovered from the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) included pneumococci (29%), E. coli and meningococci (23% each), group B streptococci (12%), Enterobacter and H. influenzae (6% each). There were no cases of Listeria monocytogenes. The mean duration of symptoms before admission was 3.1 days. The mortality rate was high (30%), and 36% of the patients had significant neurologic residua. Our study shows that this specific age group is different from newborns or older infants. Therefore, the initial selection of antibiotics for the treatment of meningitis in this age group should include antibiotics that are effective across this spectrum of potential pathogens.
TI  - [Carotid artery occlusion in meningitis due to Streptococcus B].
AB  - A 14 days old neonate presented an occlusion of the right internal carotid artery complicating a Streptococcus B meningitis. We discuss the mechanism of this rare complication of purulent meningitis, usually due to hemophilus influenzae.
TI  - Safety and efficacy of once daily ceftriaxone for the treatment of bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Fifty-seven patients with bacterial meningitis were treated with once daily ceftriaxone. After an initial loading dose of 100 mg/kg, the patients received 80 mg/kg as a single daily dose. Etiologic agents included: Haemophilus influenzae type b, 37 (11 beta-lactamase-positive); Neisseria meningitidis, 11; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 6; Streptococcus pyogenes, 1; Haemophilus influenzae type f, 1; and Group B Streptococcus, 1. All patients showed clinical improvement and all were bacteriologically cured. Satisfactory cerebrospinal fluid bactericidal activity and drug concentrations were seen 24 hours after a dose even in those patients in whom repeat spinal taps were carried out following the last dose of therapy. The drug was well-tolerated and the major adverse effect seen was diarrhea in 20.4% of the patients. The diarrhea was mild and self-limited and did not necessitate discontinuation of the drug although it was frequently associated with alterations in the stool microbiologic flora. Based on this preliminary experience, ceftriaxone, when given in a single daily dose, appears safe and effective in the treatment of bacterial meningitis in nonneonatal infants and children.
TI  - In-vitro activity of newer quinolones against aerobic bacteria.
AB  - Nalidixic and five newer 4-quinolones, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin were tested against 576 recent clinical aerobic bacterial isolates. The 4-quinolones were regularly active (MIC90 less than 4 mg/l) against the following bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, different Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Agrobacter spp., Aeromonas spp., Plesiomonas spp., Neisseria meningitidis. Other bacteria were usually intermediately susceptible or resistant: different streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Nocardia asteroides, P. maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxydans and Alcaligenes denitrificans. Ciprofloxacin was the most potent compound, followed by ofloxacin and pefloxacin, norfloxacin and enoxacin being less active. All the 4-quinolones were much more active than nalidixic acid. The MBC/MIC ratios of the 4-quinolones were between 1 and 2 with a majority of strains, and between 2 and 3 with Streptococcus agalactiae, Str. faecalis and L. monocytogenes. A two- to eight-fold increase of MIC was observed by increasing the inoculum 10,000-fold with most of the strains tested. Susceptible bacterial population of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens and P. aeruginosa contained more clones resistant to nalidixic acid (10(4) to 10(8) at four times the MIC) than to 4-quinolones (10(5) to 10(9) at four times the MIC). Supplementing the media with MgSO4 produced smaller inhibition zone diameters with a disc diffusion method than those obtained with non-supplemented agar, with all quinolone or strains. Less regular effect, or no effect was obtained after supplementation with ZnSO4 or Ca(NO3)2.
TI  - Common bacterial pneumonitis in infants. Determining the etiology and tailoring the treatment.
AB  - In infantile pneumonia, we recommend close attention to the history and physical  examination. Baseline studies, including CBC, ESR, blood cultures, and chest film, should be performed at onset and repeated as warranted. Nasopharyngeal secretions or washings should be drawn by means of gentle suction and specimens sent for Gram stain, fluorescent antibody stain for respiratory syncytial virus, and culture for bacteria and for viruses if possible. Acute and convalescent serum specimens should be obtained in serious cases to search for antibodies to RSV, adenovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, cytomegalovirus, and Chlamydia. Serum and urine specimens may be collected for countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis and latex agglutination testing for Hemophilus influenzae type B, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and if indicated, group B streptococcus. If deterioration continues and all tests are negative, the clinician should consider a more invasive procedure such as flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy, needle aspiration, or open lung biopsy. While awaiting identification of the pathogen, the physician should institute empiric therapy with optimum doses of antimicrobials and monitoring of serum levels of drug. Often the clinician is faced with deterioration and a negative workup. In this situation, other agents may be added, such as antifungal, antiviral, antiprotozoan, and antituberculous agents, as well as various antibiotics, to cover rare and unusual pathogens. Further consultation, even by phone, may at this point provide some insight into an otherwise confusing case.
TI  - Detection of bacterial antigens in body fluids by the Phadebact system.
AB  - 150 infected patients from 2 study centers had body fluids examined for presence  of bacterial antigens (group B streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae type b) using the Pharmacia Phadebact system. The rates of detection of the pneumococcal antigens in the urine or serum of the patients with pneumococcal pneumonia, pneumococcal bacteremia and pneumococcal meningitis were 0.38, 0.47 and 0.5, respectively. The overall detection rate for H. influenzae infections was 0.92 and for group B streptococcal infections 0.87. Serum and urine from 100 non-infected patients were also tested for the presence of group B streptococcus, S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis and H. influenzae type b antigens with only 1 false positive (H. influenzae type b).
TI  - Acute, subacute, and chronic osteomyelitis and pyogenic arthritis in children.

TI  - The aetiology of purulent meningitis in highland children: a bacteriological study.
AB  - Of 155 highlands children with purulent culture-positive meningitis studied from  March 1980 to September 1984, 84% were aged twelve months or less and 92% were infected with either Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae or both organisms. Other pathogens were Neisseria meningitidis (8 isolations), Streptococcus pyogenes (2 isolations) and Streptococcus agalactiae and Klebsiella species (1 of each). Among H. influenzae isolates, serotype b strains predominated (83%) and most (96%) belonged to biotype I or II. Infections due to non-b haemophili included serotype a (9 strains), serotype f (1 strain) and non-serotypable variants (3 strains). Of 67 S. pneumoniae strains 22% were resistant to benzylpenicillin, with minimal inhibitory concentrations of 0.1-1.0 micrograms/ml. The commonest serotypes were types 5 (11 isolates), type 7 (9 isolates) and types 2, 6 and 46 (6 of each). No resistance to chloramphenicol was detected in either H. influenzae or S. pneumoniae and only one of 56 strains of H. influenzae was insensitive to betalactam antibiotics. The known case fatality rate in this study was 37%. More children with pneumococcal infection died (46%) than those with haemophilus infection (30%), though the difference was not statistically significant; 79% of all deaths occurred in children aged less than twelve months. There is an urgent need for H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae vaccines that are effective in young children.
TI  - Role of cephalosporins in the treatment of bacterial meningitis in adults. Overview with special emphasis on ceftazidime.
AB  - Experience with the use of first-generation cephalosporins in bacterial meningitis has been disappointing; low concentrations were obtained in the cerebrospinal fluid, and therapeutic failures were encountered. Of the second-generation cephalosporins cefamandole, cefuroxime, and cefoxitin, only cefuroxime has proved efficacy in meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or Hemophilus influenzae. The third-generation cephalosporins offer new advantages in the treatment of meningitis because they are active at the cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtainable. Cefotaxime has produced high cure rates in patients with meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or H. influenzae. Several controlled comparative studies indicate that ceftriaxone is as effective as conventional treatment in therapy for neonatal or childhood meningitis caused by Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, or H. influenzae. Moxalactam has been found in uncontrolled studies to be effective when the cause was enteric gram-negative bacilli. Ceftazidime is a new cephalosporin with a high degree of beta-lactamase stability and a broad antibacterial spectrum, which includes Pseudomonas aeruginosa that enters the cerebrospinal fluid. Data from 29 patients who received ceftazidime as monotherapy for bacterial meningitis showed an overall cure or improvement rate of 75.9 percent. Therapy failed in three patients with meningitis caused by gram-positive organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. agalactiae), and in three with gram-negative organisms. Of 14 patients with Pseudomonas meningitis, 11 showed a cure, as did six of six patients with meningitis caused by Enterobacter, Serratia, or Acinetobacter. More, preferably controlled, studies of the efficacy of ceftazidime in the treatment of meningitis should be undertaken.
TI  - Prospective comparative trial of ceftriaxone vs. conventional therapy for treatment of bacterial meningitis in children.
AB  - Fifty children with bacterial meningitis were prospectively evaluated in a randomized comparative trial of twice daily ceftriaxone with conventional ampicillin and chloramphenicol therapy. The groups were comparable in age, sex, days of illness before admission, severity of illness at admission, etiology and admission cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) parameters and bacterial colony counts. The pathogens were Haemophilus influenzae type b (34 beta-lactamase-negative, 8 beta-lactamase-positive); Streptococcus pneumoniae (4); Neisseria meningitidis (3); and Streptococcus agalactiae (1). Initial CSF colony counts ranged from 2.5 X 10(2) to 1 X 10(10) colony-forming units/ml. In 44 children a lumbar puncture was repeated 10.5 to 18 hours after starting treatment; 16 of 24 (67%) ceftriaxone patients and 12 of 20 (60%) conventional therapy patients had sterile cultures. The reduction in the CSF bacterial colony counts (6.3 log10 colony-forming units/ml) was similar in both groups. Ceftriaxone CSF levels ranged from 1.0 to 8.0 micrograms/ml, representing a mean CSF penetration of 11.3% (range, 3.0 to 24.5%) of the simultaneous serum concentration. The median ceftriaxone bactericidal titer in CSF was 1:1024 compared with 1:4 achieved with conventional therapy. There were no significant differences in clinical responses or in frequency of complications, except for diarrhea which occurred in 59% of the ceftriaxone group and in 22% of the other (P less than 0.01). Despite one H. influenzae type b relapse occurring in the ceftriaxone group, ceftriaxone appears to be safe and as effective as conventional therapy for bacterial meningitis in children older than 2 months of age.
TI  - Cefmenoxime: clinical evaluation.
AB  - Cefmenoxime was evaluated in an open trial consisting of 41 patients. Forty infections in 36 patients could be evaluated. Thirteen patients had pyelonephritis due to Escherichia coli (two bacteremic), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Streptococcus faecalis; all improved and 12 of 13 were clinically cured, but one relapse (S. faecalis) occurred at two weeks. Six patients with cystitis due to E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, P. aeruginosa, or S. faecalis all improved, but relapse or reinfection, or both, occurred in five due to P. aeruginosa, S. faecalis, C. fruendii, or E. coli. Neurogenic bladder or other complications were present in five of 13 patients with pyelonephritis and five of six with cystitis. Ten patients with pneumonia and one with tracheobronchitis due to Hemophilus influenzae, S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, or Neisseria meningitidis all improved and seven had resolution without relapse, but P. aeruginosa emerged in two patients, one of whom died. Eight soft tissue infections due to Staphylococcus aureus, Peptococcus prevotti, Streptococcus species, or infections of mixed origin resolved in six. Sterility of blood cultures was obtained in one patient with endocarditis due to S. anginosus, but other therapy was substituted. Clinical resolution of the toxic shock syndrome and subsequent negative endocervical cultures for S. aureus occurred in one. Granulocytopenia of unverified cause in four (with less than 1,500 mm3) and two (with less than 2,000 mm3) was reversible. Headache during treatment occurred in six patients and a possible disulfiram-like effect in three. Elevations of serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase and alkaline phosphatase occurred in five, Coombs' positivity in two, and diarrhea in three. Clinical efficacy of cefmenoxime was significant. Possible side effects require further study.
TI  - [MICs and MBCs of cefotaxime, desacetylcefotaxime and ceftriaxone against four principal bacteria causing meningitis].
AB  - The MICs and MBCs of cefotaxime (CTX), desacetylcefotaxime (Des-CTX) and ceftriaxone (CTRX) were determined in relation to 4 of the principal bacterial species which cause meningitis, i.e., S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, H. influenzae and E. coli. These tests were performed using final inocula of 10(8) cells/ml and 10(6) cells/ml. Comparison was made with the MIC and MBC values of benzylpenicillin (PCG) and ampicillin (ABPC). 1. Against 25 strains of S. pneumoniae, the MIC 90 values with inocula levels of 10(8) and 10(6) cells/ml were as follows: CTX, 0.05 and 0.024 micrograms/ml; Des-CTX, 0.39 and 0.20 micrograms/ml; CTRX, 0.10 and 0.05 micrograms/ml, respectively; and PCG, less than 0.012 micrograms/ml at both size. Similarly, the MBC 90 values were: CTX, 0.01 and 0.05 micrograms/ml; Des-CTX, 0.78 and 0.39 micrograms/ml; CTRX, 0.20 and 0.10 micrograms/ml; and PCG, 0.024 and 0.012 micrograms/ml, respectively. It is thus apparent that PCG showed the lowest values for both the MIC and MBC, followed by CTX, CTRX and then Des-CTX. Against 25 strains of S. agalactiae, the MIC 90 values with inocula of 10(8) and 10(6) cells/ml were as follows: CTX, 0.05 and 0.05 micrograms/ml; Des-CTX, 0.39 and 0.20 micrograms/ml; CTRX, 0.10 and 0.05 micrograms/ml; and PCG, 0.39 and 0.20 micrograms/ml, respectively. Similarly, the MBC 90 values of Des-CTX were 0.78 and 0.39 micrograms/ml, while the other 3 antibiotics showed the same values with both the 10(8) and 10(6) cells/ml inocula: 0.10 micrograms/ml for CTX, 0.20 micrograms/ml for CTRX and 0.39 micrograms/ml for PCG. Accordingly, CTX showed the lowest values, followed by CTRX and then PCG being about the same as Des-CTX. Against 25 strains of H. influenzae, the MIC 90 values with inocula levels of 10(8) and 10(6) cells/ml were as follows: CTX, 0.10 and 0.05 micrograms/ml; Des-CTX, 0.39 and 0.39 micrograms/ml; CTRX, 0.10 and 0.05 micrograms/ml; and ABPC, 50 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Similarly, the MBC 90 values were: CTX, 0.20 and 0.10 micrograms/ml; Des-CTX, 1.56 and 1.56 micrograms/ml; CTRX, 0.39 and 0.20 micrograms/ml; and ABPC, greater than 100 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. Accordingly, in terms of the MIC 90, CTX and CTRX showed the same values, but in terms of the MBC 90 CTX was superior. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - An evaluation of latex particle agglutination to detect antigenemia in children.
AB  - Latex particle agglutination (LPA) was used to detect specific bacterial capsular antigen in sera collected at the time blood samples were taken from children with suspected bacteremia. Capsular polysaccharide antigens tested for were Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hi b), Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp), Streptococcus agalactiae (Sa) and Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) groups A and C. An adequate volume of serum was available for 1085 of the blood culture sets received. Antigenemia was detected in 47 children; 36 children from whom the homologous microorganism was isolated from the associated blood culture and 11 children who had prior antibiotic therapy and whose blood culture grew no microorganism. Antigenemia was not detected in 46 children whose blood culture yielded a bacterium for which a homologous LPA reagent was available. Fifty children had positive blood cultures with microorganisms considered significant to which no LPA reagent was available. LPA was of value as a rapid diagnostic test in the identification of the etiological agent in severe infectious disease in children.
TI  - Quantitation of bacteria in cerebrospinal fluid and blood of children with meningitis and its diagnostic significance.
AB  - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from pediatric patients with meningitis were  examined for their concentration of microbes and the relationship of this count to the bacteremia levels, microscopy results, and polymorphonuclear leukocyte concentration. A total of 2,031 consecutive CSF specimens were analyzed, of which 63 (3.1%) were positive by culture from the same number of patients. We observed that 85% of the total CSF specimens positive for Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Neisseria meningitidis had counts in excess of 10(3) CFU/ml, with 56% of the specimens exceeding 10(5) CFU/ml. A correlation existed between the number of organisms present in the CSF and blood. For example, from a total of 22 patients who had counts of H. influenzae greater than 10(3) CFU/ml in the CSF, 16 or 73% had levels of bacteremia greater than 10(3) CFU/ml. It was also noted that the bacterial concentration had a profound effect on the sensitivity of microscopy. The percentage of positive results increased from 25% with less than or equal to 10(3) CFU/ml to 60% in the range of greater than 10(3) to 10(5) CFU/ml and to 97% at concentrations of greater than 10(5) CFU/ml. Furthermore, a significant correlation (P less than 0.01) was noted between the concentration of bacteria in the CSF and the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes observed on microscopy.
TI  - Antibacterial monoclonal antibodies and the dawn of a new era in the control of infection.
AB  - Literature reports concerned with monoclonal antibodies against bacteria, or their toxins, which are pathogens for man and animals were surveyed. These antibodies have important potential uses in human and veterinary pathology and medicine. They are likely to become key elements in a fast progression toward a more complete understanding and control of infectious diseases and of toxin poisoning. A new area of bacteriology relevant to sanitary engineering is also being advanced with the help of antibacterial monoclonal antibodies. This area involves bacteria that produce the biofuel methane, along with other molecules of nutritional value, through a process which brings about the recycling of organic wastes and thereby limits or controls microbial contamination of soil and water.
TI  - Evaluation of the Phadebact CSF test for detection of the four most common causes of bacterial meningitis.
AB  - A five-center collaborative study was undertaken to determine the suitability of  the Phadebact CSF test kit and the Phadebact group B Streptococcus reagent for routine use by clinical laboratories to detect antigens of common organisms causing bacterial meningitis. The kits employ staphylococcal protein A coagglutination to detect the antigens of Haemophilus influenzae types a, b, c, d, e, and f, Neisseria meningitidis groups A, B, C, Y, and W135, Streptococcus pneumoniae (83 serotypes), and group B Streptococcus. A total of 2,817 individual tests were performed on 577 cerebrospinal fluid specimens. The percent positive specimens detected by coagglutination was as follows: overall, 84%; H. influenzae, 97%; group B Streptococcus, 75%; S. pneumoniae, 71%; and N. meningitidis, 58%. Eighty-five of the specimens were also tested by counterimmunoelectrophoresis. Coagglutination was more sensitive than counterimmunoelectrophoresis because it detected 74% of the positive specimens, whereas counterimmunoelectrophoresis detected only 65%. No false-positive results were obtained with coagglutination. The Phadebact CSF test kit is recommended for routine use in screening cerebrospinal fluid samples for antigens of the common organisms causing bacterial meningitis along with the Gram stain and culture for delayed confirmation of the rapid results.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of microbicidal cationic proteins 1 and 2, natural peptide antibiotics of rabbit lung macrophages.
AB  - Microbicidal cationic proteins 1 and 2, peptides derived from rabbit lung macrophages, were tested for bactericidal activity against various bacterial species. Both were highly active against diverse gram-positive and gram-negative organisms under conditions of near-neutral pH (between 7 and 8) and relatively low ionic strength. Susceptible species included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens. Streptococcus agalactiae, type 1A, was less susceptible than the aforementioned organisms or S. agalactiae, type 3. Bordetella bronchiseptica, a common commensal and pathogen of the rabbit respiratory tract, was completely resistant to both peptides.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide-mediated antagonism against serratia marcescens by Streptococcus mitis.
AB  - The alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus mitis strain no. 17-1, isolated from the oral cavity of an healthy female adult, antagonized the growth of all 24 test strains of Serratia marcescens examined; furthermore, this strain inhibited the growth of various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae. However, strans of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved refractory. The mechanism of microbial antagonism was due to production and release of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic atmospheric conditions, which was neutralized through incorporation of bovine liver catalase into the solid assay medium.
TI  - [The antibacterial activity of new cephem antibiotics against clinical isolates.  A comparison of the antibacterial activity of cefotaxime with 6 other antibiotics].
AB  - During the period from May through July 1981, a comparative study was carried out on the antibacterial activities of cefotaxime (CTX) and ceftizoxime (CZX), cefoperazone (CPZ), latamoxef (LMOX), cefotiam (CTM), cefmetazole (CMZ) and cefazolin (CEZ). CTX and these other cephem antibiotics were tested against fresh clinical isolates which had been obtained from clinical materials by the laboratories of 14 participating medical institutions. 1. The clinical isolates were obtained from various clinical materials in the following decreasing order: urine, sputum and pus/discharge; 85.7% of the isolates came from these materials. 2. Concerning the sources of each species of clinical isolates, it was found that P. aeruginosa was isolated from the greatest number -9- of different clinical materials. This was followed by E. coli and E. cloacae, each isolated from 8 different clinical materials, and C. freundii and E. aerogenes, each found in 7 different clinical materials. 3. In relation to S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae and S. pneumoniae, CTX showed the best antibacterial activity; the second most potent antibiotic was CZX. CMZ and LMOX were found to show relatively high MIC values for those species. Against S. aureus, CEZ showed the best antibacterial activity, but 3 resistant strains had MICs of greater than 100 micrograms/ml. 4. With regard to Gram-negative bacteria, CTX and CZX showed the best antibacterial activities for all of the species, except for P. aeruginosa. These were followed, in order, by LMOX and CPZ. Compared with these 4 antibiotics, CTM, CMZ and CEZ were found to have inferior antibacterial activities against these bacteria. In relation to P. aeruginosa, the peak of the MIC distribution for CPZ was 6.25 micrograms/ml, and this was the best antibacterial activity detected with the various antibiotics tested. This was followed by CTX (25 micrograms/ml) LMOX (25 micrograms/ml) and CZX (50 micrograms/ml). CTM had an MIC of 100 micrograms/ml for 1 strain, and MICs of greater than 100 micrograms/ml for all of the other strains of P. aeruginosa, indicating them to be resistant to this antibiotic. All of the strains were resistant to CMZ and CEZ, showing MICs of greater than 100 micrograms/ml. 5. For each of the tested antibiotics, no correlation was found between the MIC and the serogroup for either P. aeruginosa or S. marcescens.
TI  - [Rapid diagnosis of purulent meningitis].
AB  - The cerebrospinal fluid of 589 subjects, 78 of whom were suffering from a purulent meningitis were examined. Comparatively by classical bacteriological techniques (direct examination and culture) and by electro-immunodiffusion, latex agglutination, and Limulus endotoxin assay. Soluble bacterial Haemophilus influenzae type B, Neisseria meningitidis group A, C, and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigens, were tested by electro-immunodiffusion and latex agglutination, and soluble bacterial N. meningitidis group B, Listeria monocytogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae antigens by electro-immunodiffusion. Specific antigens and endotoxin were found in 75.8 per cent of the specimens with a rapid answer (120 min). The three tests revealed also only the diagnosis in 29.1 per cent of cases of pneumococcal meningitis, in 33.3 per cent of meningococcal meningitis and in 47 per cent of Gram-negative bacteria meningitis. Only five cerebrospinal fluid from the 589 specimens tested were given a non-specific reaction. These two advantages--sensitivity and specificity--of these three tests render them techniques of the future in the diagnosis of purulent meningitis.

TI  - Infection as a predominant cause of perinatal mortality.
AB  - During a 15-month period, all 34 infants delivered at the department of obstetrics and gynecology at University Hospital in Lund, Sweden, who died perinatally or neonatally were included in a prospective study of causes of death. Autopsies--including extensive culturing of specimens for bacteria, chlamydia, fungi, mycoplasmas, and viruses--were performed for all infants. Maternal sera obtained during pregnancy and after delivery were examined regarding titers against a number of microorganisms. During the study period, the perinatal mortality rate was 0.60% and the neonatal mortality rate 0.56%. It was found that 37% of the deaths were caused by lethal malformations, 17% by idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome, and 9% by ablatio placentae. However, no less than 21% occurred as a direct consequence of infections, including 2 deaths caused by group B streptococci, 2 by Coxsackie B virus, and 3 deaths each by Hemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas pyocyanea, and Candida albicans. A 6-month study of late abortions revealed another case of intrauterine group B streptococcal infection. The study has demonstrated that autopsy, including microbial examination, is recommended in all cases of perinatal and neonatal deaths.
TI  - Etiologic agents of meningitis in early life.
AB  
TI  - Antagonism of ampicillin and chloramphenicol for meningeal isolates of group B streptococci.
AB  - The increasing prevalence of ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae type b has led to the recommendation that ampicillin and chloramphenicol be given as the initial therapy for suspected bacterial meningitis in infants and children. However, during the first 2 months of life, H. influenzae type b is a rare cause of meningitis, whereas group B streptococcus is the most frequently isolated agent. Since ampicillin and chloramphenicol have been shown to be antagonistic for other streptococci, an in vitro study of their effect on group B streptococci was performed. The effect of ampicillin and chloramphenicol, alone and in combination, on 18 meningeal isolates was determined for 2 different inocula of group B streptococci, using microtiter broth dilution and growth kinetic assays. Isoboles, fractional lethal concentration indices, or both indicated antagonism for all strains. Growth kinetic assays for two representative strains demonstrated inhibition of the early bactericidal activity of ampicillin by chloramphenicol. These findings of in vitro antagonism suggest that this combination may be contraindicated for the treatment of infants with group B streptococcal meningitis.
TI  - Cellulitis: treatment with cefoxitin compared with multiple antibiotic therapy.
AB  - Cefoxitin, a parenteral cephamycin beta-lactam antibiotic was prospectively evaluated as a single drug alternative in 31 children with cellulitis and the results of therapy were compared retrospectively with those from prevailing multiple antibiotic therapy for cellulitis in 56 children. Periorbital and lower extremity cellulitis accounted for more than 60% of the cases in both study groups. The most common bacterial agents included Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus. In as many as 50% of the cases, no etiologic agent could be found. In addition to blood cultures, cellulitis leading edge aspirate cultures were helpful in establishing the etiologic diagnosis. Of 52 patients sampled in the combined studies, 21% had positive aspirate cultures in the presence of negative blood cultures. The outcome and mean duration of hospital stay were similar in both groups. No severe adverse reactions were encountered. The mean number of antibiotics used in the retrospective study was three (range 1 to 7) whereas cefoxitin alone was used in the prospective study. All organisms isolated in the prospective study were susceptible to cefoxitin. Single antibiotic therapy with cefoxitin appears to be as safe and as effective in the treatment of cellulitis in children as multiple antibiotic therapy.
TI  - [The diagnostic significance of countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) in bacterial meningitis in children (author's transl)].
AB  - In 52 children with meningitis caused by Hemophilus influenzae, pneumococci, meningococci and group B streptococci the organism responsible could be identified in 41 cases (79%) within one hour with specific antisera by means of countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis (CIE). False positive results were not observed in meningitis caused by other organisms, aseptic meningitis, septicemia, etc. In 4 cases the organism could only be identified by CIE since the children had received antibiotics and the culture was negative. Group B meningococci are often missed in CIE. CIE proved to be a valuable tool in diagnostic procedures of bacterial meningitis.

TI  - Minimum number of bacteria needed for antigen detection by counterimmunoelectrophoresis: in vivo and in vitro studies.
AB  - Threshold concentrations of Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Streptococcus sp. group B type Ib required for positive counterimmunoelectrophoresis reactions were determined in vivo and in vitro. Animals were infected intraperitoneally with various concentrations of microorganisms: adult mice with S. pneumoniae, suckling rats with H. influenzae, and 3-week-old mice with Streptococcus sp. group B. At 24 h after infection a minimum blood concentration of 10(3) colony-forming units (CFU)/ml was needed for S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae before antigen was detected in the serum. A minimum concentration of 10(6) CFU/ml was needed for Streptococcus sp. group B at 10 h after infection. Larger threshold concentrations (10(4) CFU/ml for S. pneumoniae, 10(5) CFU/ml for H. influenzae, and 10(7) CFU/ml for Streptococcus) were required in broth-grown cultures before cell-free antigens could be demonstrated by counterimmunoelectrophoresis in the medium. Marked levels of antigen release by group B streptococci were observed as the cultures entered early stationary phase. This study provides evidence of a long-accepted, though poorly substantiated, hypothesis that a threshold concentration of microorganism is necessary before counterimmunoelectrophoresis reactions become positive. Counterimmunoelecrophoresis results for clinical specimens should be interpreted cautiously in light of this evidence.
TI  - Use of monoclonal antibodies in an enzyme-linked inhibition assay for rapid detection of streptococcal antigen.
AB  - We have developed an enzyme-linked monoclonal antibody inhibition assay to detect bacterial antigens in cerebrospinal fluid. The monoclonal antibody used in this immunodiagnostic test was produced by continuous cultures of hybrid myeloma cell lines. Using this assay, type III GBS antigen was detected in CSF specimens from 11 culture-proven cases of GBS meningitis and in the knee aspirate from an infant with GBS septic arthritis. Five spinal fluid specimens from meningitis due to other bacterial pathogens and ten other control samples were negative. The ELMIA detected streptococcal antigen at a concentration of 10 ng/ml, and is more sensitive and specific than currently used immunodiagnostic tests.
TI  - Meningitis. Update of recommendations for the neonate.
AB  - Our series of children with meningitis shows an increase in the frequency of isolation of Hemophilus influenzae type B. This increase is most marked among children between one and two months of age. Since H. influenzae was found in five of the seven children between thirty and sixty days of age, we recommend the use of chloramphenicol for the initial treatment of bacterial meningitis after the first month of life. Additionally, our mortality data suggest that early diagnosis and intensive supportive therapy can contribute to a further decrease in the fatality rate of this disease.
TI  - Intravenous cefotaxime in children with bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Thirteen children with meningitis due to Haemophilus influenzae, beta-haemolytic  streptococcus group B, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Neisseria meningitidis, Escherichia coli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa and who had been unsuccessfully treated with other antibiotics or had causative organisms which were resistant to available antibiotics were treated with intravenous cefotaxime. Nine children were cured; in one case infection (with a different organism) recurred but a further course of cefotaxime was successful; one child died, with sterile CSF; one child died from his underlying disease (astrocytoma); and one child was cured with sequelae (hydrocephalus). A further child with meningitis caused by E. coli had been treated unsuccessfully by intravenous and intraventricular chloramphenicol and gentamicin; intravenous and intraventricular cefotaxime was successful. The agent was well tolerated. CSF levels were measured in seven children and ranged from 300 to 27 200 microgram/l; published and unpublished in-vitro studies suggest that minimum inhibitory concentrations for cefotaxime against the organisms commonly causing bacterial meningitis are usually well below 250 microgram/l.
TI  - Detection of experimental bacteremia and fungemia by examination of buffy coat prepared by a micromethod.
AB  - Rabbits received intravenous injections of bacteria or fungi, and a comparison was made of the abilities of broth cultures, plating after dilution either in saline solution or in distilled water containing Triton X-100, and buffy coat examinations to detect the organisms in heart blood. The most sensitive method was broth culture. By microscopy or subculture of buffy coat cells prepared by centrifugation of blood in microhematocrit tubes, organisms were rapidly and regularly detected when their viable counts increased to 300--1,000/ml as detected by plating. By micromodification, buffy coat examination is technically easy to perform, and the method is only slightly less sensitive than when a larger amount of blood is used. Thus, it would be ideal for rapid provisional diagnosis of sepsis in patients, e.g., neonates, when the use of only a small blood sample is preferred.

TI  - Upper respiratory tract spread of group B streptococci type I b in a kindergarten.
AB  - In a kindergarten with 42 children and 17 female staff members, an epidemic of group B streptococcal carriage in the upper respiratory tract occurred. In the middle of February 1978, 6 children and 5 adults carried type I b streptococci in the throat while only 2 of these 11 were carriers 2 weeks later. Only one other streptococcus, belonging to type II, was found in the throat specimens. Five strains other than type I b were found in the urogenital tract of the staff. Three type I b throat carriers were also urogenital carriers of this type. The spread of type I b streptococci could have resulted from co-spreading with other upper respiratory tract pathogens found, including group A streptococci of type 12. Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis and pneumococci. Estimation of antibodies with radiolabelled protein A indicated an immune response to type I b, but not to types I a, II or III group B streptococci in the staff compared with healthy blood donors.
TI  - Comparison of staphylococcal coagglutination, latex agglutination, and counterimmunoelectrophoresis for bacterial antigen detection.
AB  - Soluble antigens of Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and group B streptococcus were looked for in cerebrospinal fluid, serum, and urine by using the staphylococcal coagglutination test, latex agglutination test, and counterimmunoelectrophoresis. The staphylococcal coaggultination and latex agglutination tests were more sensitive than counterimmunoelectrophoresis in identifying antigens of H. influenzae type b, S. pneumoniae, and N. meningitidis. None of the three tests successfully detected group B streptococcal antigens in body fluids. Nonspecific reactions noted with the staphylococcal coagglutination test could be usually eliminated after premixing test specimens with soluble protein A.
TI  - Evaluation of the counterimmunoelectrophoretic (CIE) procedure in a clinical laboratory setting.
AB  - The counterimmunoelectrophoretic (CIE) procedure was evaluated under clinical laboratory conditions to determine its validity and comparability with culture methods. The procedure was further evaluated to determine applicability to a variety of clinical samples. An inexpensive set-up was developed to utilize the CIE procedure at bench level. Results indicated the procedure to be sensitive in detecting Haemophilus influenzae, type b, and Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus), group B. The procedure was more sensitive for detection of H. influenzae, type b, than for meningococcus, group B. The authors have confirmed the usefulness of the CIE procedure in the detection of group B streptococci, pneumococci and teichoic acid antibody to Staphylococcus aureus. Detection of Escherichia coli K 1 antigen was also accomplished by CIE. In the authors' laboratory the CIE procedure was superior to culture methods when used for the detection of H. influenzae, type b, and meningococcus group B.
TI  - Bacterial etiology of otitis media during the first six weeks of life.
AB  - Tympanocentesis was performed on 70 infants who had otitis media during the first six weeks of life. The bacteria isolated from their middle-ear effusions were Streptococcus pneumoniae (13 patients), Neisseria catarrhalis (11 patients), Hemophilus influenzae (ten patients), Enterobacteriaceae (four patients), Staphylococcus aureus (four patients), streptococci (groups A and B) (three patients), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (two patients). Thirty patients (42.9%) had middle-ear effusions which did not contain pathogenic bacteria. Twenty-seven infants were followed for at least 12 months and 12 (44.4%) of these infants had six or more episodes of otitis media during the observation period. Further studies will be needed to establish the significance of middle-ear disease at this age and the role of therapy in improving its outcome.

TI  - Concentrations of bacteria in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Concentrations of bacteria in cerebrospinal fluid ranged from 4.5 X 10(3) to 3 X  10(8) colony-forming units/ml in 27 patients with bacterial meningitis before antibiotic therapy and from 4 X 10(1) to 1.4 X 10(6) CFU/ml in four patients after one to two days of antibiotic therapy. All patients with persistent positive cultures had pretreatment concentrations of 10(7) CFU/ml or greater. A significant association was observed between cerebrospinal fluid lactic acid dehydrogenase activity and concentrations of bacteria (p less than 0.01). Large inocula of Hemophilus influenzae type b (10(7)) increased the minimal inhibitory concentration for penicillin and ampicillin but not for chloramphenicol. The minimal inhibitory concentration of each of the three antibiotics increased when group B streptococci were assayed. These data indicate that persistence of a positive culture may be related to large initial concentrations of bacteria. The relative "resistance" in vitro of large inocula possibly contributes to this persistence. These observations are also consistent with the hypothesis that lactic acid dehydrogenase activity in cerebrospinal fluid is derived from bacteria.
TI  - Meningitis caused by Streptococcus in adults.
AB  - Meningitis caused by Streptococcus is uncommon in adults. Otitis media, mastoiditis, sinusitis, or trauma has antedated most cases reported in the past. Data on 10 recent cases suggest changes in the current pathogenesis of streptococcal meningitis in adults and emphasize the importance of accurate streptococcal speciation. Endocarditis was present in five cases; trauma played a role in two others. Brain abscess, corticosteroids, alcoholic cirrhosis, and peritonitis secondary to chronic peritoneal dialysis were etiologic factors in five patients. Otitis media, mastoiditis, and sinusitis were conspicuously absent. Streptococcus agalctiae accounted for purulent meningitis in two postmenopausal women. Both strains of group B Streptococcus were bacitracin-sensitive and were thus mislabeled group A. Recognition of Streptococcus bovis spared two patients unnecessary aminoglycoside adminstration. Nine of the 10 patients survived, including a women with prosthetic mitral valve endocarditis and a man with a ruptured brain abscess. Differentiation of these streptococci from Streptococcus pneumoniae was seldon possible on the basis of the spinal fluid gram stain alone.

TI  - Immunoelectroosmophoresis (IEOP) for detection of bacterial antigens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - 365 cerebrospinal fluid specimens from 259 patients were tested by the immunoelectroosmophoretic (IEOP) method to detect bacterial antigens. 25 patients had bacterial meningitis. The bacterial agent was identified by IEOP in 16 of 21 cases with aetiological agents detectable with the antisera employed. No false positive reactions occurred. The test gave true negative results in 340 instances. The rapidity, simplicity, sensitivity, reliability and low cost are emphasized.
