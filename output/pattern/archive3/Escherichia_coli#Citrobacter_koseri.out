in vitro spectrum of pexiganan activity when tested against pathogens from diabetic foot infections and with selected resistance mechanisms.
pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid synthetic cationic peptide, is currently in phase 3 clinical trials as a topical antimicrobial agent for the treatment of mild infections associated with diabetic foot ulcers. bacterial isolates from the 2013 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program designated as pathogens from diabetic foot infections (dfi) and gram-negative and -positive pathogens from various infection types that harbored selected resistance mechanisms/phenotypes were tested against pexiganan in reference cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth. the mic50 and mic90 against all organisms tested from dfi were 16 and 32 mug/ml, respectively. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter koseri, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter species, and pseudomonas aeruginosa mic values ranged from 8 to 16 mug/ml. pexiganan mic values among staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa] and methicillin-susceptible s. aureus [mssa]), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and enterococcus faecium ranged from 8 to 32 mug/ml. pexiganan activity was not adversely affected for members of the family enterobacteriaceae or p. aeruginosa that produced beta-lactamases or resistance mechanisms to other commonly used antimicrobial agents. decreased susceptibility to vancomycin did not affect pexiganan activity against s. aureus or e. faecium. enterococcus faecalis appears to be intrinsically less susceptible to pexiganan (mic, 32 to 256 mug/ml). the "all organism" mic90 of 32 mug/ml for pexiganan in this study was >250-fold below the pexiganan concentration in the cream/delivery vehicle being developed for topical use.
diversity of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae on hospital admission.
extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae have become  prevalent in both the hospital and the community. we describe the epidemiology of esbl-producing isolates and patient characteristics at hospital admission. data on clinical properties, medical history, previous hospitalizations, and previous antibiotic treatments were collected. esbl genes (bla(ctx-m), bla(tem), and bla(shv)) were identified by polymerase chain reaction. one hundred and sixteen patients carried 122 esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae: 79 escherichia coli, 26 klebsiella pneumoniae, 16 enterobacter spp., and 1 citrobacter koseri. esbl-producing e. coli were associated with admission from home (odds ratio (or) 3.04, p = 0.02) and a history of recent urinary tract infection (or 3.38, p = 0.04), and exhibited a lower rate of antimicrobial resistance to aminoglycosides (p </= 0.005) and co-trimoxazole (p = 0.003), whereas other esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae tended to be associated with a recent surgery (or 0.42, p = 0.057). although the ctx-m enzymes were more frequently found in e. coli (76%), they were also identified in other enterobacteriaceae (45%), suggesting penetration of ctx-m-type enzymes into both community- and hospital-acquired enterobacterial species.
indole can act as an extracellular signal to regulate biofilm formation of escherichia coli and other indole-producing bacteria.
we demonstrated previously that genetic inactivation of tryptophanase is responsible for a dramatic decrease in biofilm formation in the laboratory strain escherichia coli s17-1. in the present study, we tested whether the biochemical inhibition of tryptophanase, with the competitive inhibitor oxindolyl-l-alanine, could affect polystyrene colonization by e. coli and other indole-producing bacteria. oxindolyl-l-alanine inhibits, in a dose-dependent manner, indole production and biofilm formation by strain s17-1 grown in luria-bertani (lb) medium. supplementation with indole at physiologically relevant concentrations restores biofilm formation by strain s17-1 in the presence of oxindolyl-l-alanine and by mutant strain e. coli 3714 (s17-1 tnaa::tn5) in lb medium. oxindolyl-l-alanine also inhibits the adherence of s17-1 cells to polystyrene for a 3-h incubation time, but mutant strain 3714 cells are unaffected. at 0.5 mg/ml, oxindolyl-l-alanine exhibits inhibitory activity against biofilm formation in lb medium and in synthetic urine for several clinical isolates of e. coli, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter koseri, providencia stuartii, and morganella morganii but has no affect on indole-negative klebsiella pneumoniae strains. in conclusion, these data suggest that indole, produced by the action of tryptophanase, is involved in polystyrene colonization by several indole-producing bacterial species. indole may act as a signalling molecule to regulate the expression of adhesion and biofilm-promoting factors.
the effects of plant phenolics, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid and ferulic acid on arylamine n-acetyltransferase activities in human gastrointestinal microflora.
the possible effects of naturally occurring plant phenolics, caffeic acid (ca), chlorogenic acid (cga) and ferulic acid (fa) on arylamine n-acetyltransferase (nat) activities on human gastrointestinal microflora, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter koseri and pseudomonas aeruginosa, were examined. the bacterial nat activities were determined by hplc measuring the acetylation of 2-aminofluorene (2-af). among all examined bacteria, p. aeruginosa exerted the highest nat activity while c. koseri possessed the lowest nat activity. ca, cga and fa could suppress the bacterial nat activities dose-dependently both in the intact cell and cytosolic fraction analysis. according to the analysis of kinetic parameters in e. coli and p. aeruginosa, ca, cga and fa were shown to be potent noncompetitive inhibitors of bacterial nat activities. for the time course experiment, 4 mm of ca and fa could inhibit bacterial nat activities for at least 4 hour but 4 mm of cga could only significantly suppress nat activity in e. coli for the same reaction time. these results strongly demonstrated that ca, cga and fa inhibited nat activities in human gastrointestinal bacteria.
