TI  - Susceptibility of methacrylate-based root canal filling to degradation by bacteria found in endodontic infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To present a case of endodontic failure obturated with a methacrylate-based root filling material, Resilon/RealSeal (RS). To determine if RS is susceptible to biodegradation by endodontically relevant microbes by a method known to show RS degradation. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Emulsions of RS were dispersed in agar with minimal bacterial nutrients in culture plates. Lipase PS served as a positive control. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were tested for their ability to biodegrade RS. The bacteria were inoculated in the plates and examined daily for RS degradation for 7 days. RESULTS: Degradation of the emulsified RS manifested in the formation of clear zones around P aeruginosa, P intermedia, P asaccharolytica, S aureus, and S epidermidis. No degradation was seen with the other tested bacteria or in plates that did not contain RS emulsion. CONCLUSION: Endodontic pathogenic bacteria can degrade RS. These findings complement other work and suggest that the seal and integrity of root canal fillings obturated with RS may be impaired by a microbial insult.
TI  - A brain abscess following dental extractions in a patient with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.
AB  - Oral and maxillofacial surgeons must be aware of the potentially life-threatening complications of dental extractions in patients with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia because of their high prevalence of pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas. Despite the lack of evidence-based guidelines, antibiotic cover should be given to patients with HHT who require oral surgery according to the same rules as those used for patients at high risk of bacterial endocarditis.
TI  - Characterization of bacterial flora in persistent apical periodontitis lesions.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Microorganisms are able to survive and induce persistent infection  in periapical tissues. The aim of this study was to investigate the composition of the microflora of persistent apical periodontitis lesions. METHODS: Twenty apical lesion samples were obtained from 20 patients with chronic apical periodontitis by root end surgery and processed using aerobic or anaerobic culture techniques. All isolated strains were identified by 16S ribosomal DNA sequence analysis. RESULTS: Seventy-four strains were isolated, belonging to 31 bacterial species obtained from the 20 apical lesions that were isolated. The majority of the strains were facultative anaerobes (51.6%). Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Fusobacterium nucleatum were isolated from 16.2, 9.5, 6.8 and 5.4% of the samples, respectively. Fifteen samples harboured more than one species. The predominant association was P. acnes, S. epidermidis and F. nucleatum. CONCLUSION: The microbiota of persistent apical periodontitis lesions is composed by diverse types of microorganisms with biofilm-forming capacity, including P. acnes, S. epidermidis and F. nucleatum.
TI  - Stimulation of Fusobacterium nucleatum biofilm formation by Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Bacterial infection is a major cause of periapical periodontitis. Eradication of these microorganisms from apical lesions is essential to the success of endodontic treatment. The aim of this study was to clarify the molecular interaction between Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis and other microorganisms associated with periapical periodontitis. METHODS: Microorganisms isolated from periapical lesions were inoculated into type-I collagen-coated polystyrene microtiter plates and maintained at 37 degrees C under anaerobic conditions for 2 days, after which, the quantity of organized biofilm on the plates was evaluated by crystal violet staining. Growth enhancement via soluble factor was evaluated by separated coculture using a 0.4-mum membrane filter. RESULTS: F. nucleatum exhibited strong adherence to type-I collagen-coated polystyrene microplates. Biofilm formation by F. nucleatum was significantly enhanced by P. gingivalis. It was complemented by compartmentalized coculture with P. gingivalis. Enhancement of biofilm formation by P. gingivalis was only slightly reduced by inactivation of its autoinducer-2-producing gene luxS. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that P. gingivalis enhances biofilm formation by F. nucleatum by releasing diffusible signaling molecules other than autoinducer-2.
TI  - An in vitro study of antimicrobial activity and efficacy of iodine-generating hydrogel dressings.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the antimicrobial activity and efficacy of different formulations of novel bioxygenating hydrogel dressings (which deliver both iodine and oxygen into the wound) against various target organisms by means of an in vitro test system that more effectively mimics the conditions encountered when dressings are in contact with wounds. METHOD: Three bioxygenating hydrogels were tested: Oxyzyme, which releases low levels of iodine into the wound, and Iodozyme 402 and Iodozyme 401, which release higher levels of iodine, with Iodozyme 402 releasing twice the amount of 401. Cellulose filter disks (n = 32) were inoculated with indicator species and placed equidistant from each other as a matrix onto agar test beds. Cut squares of control or test dressings were placed on top of each disk. Kill curves were constructed from determinations of the numbers of survivors (log cfu per disk) over time by removing disk samples at various time points. RESULTS: Significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed between the controls and test samples. The order of sensitivity for Oxyzyme was Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides fragilis, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The order of efficacy of the three hydrogel dressings (Iodozyme 402, followed by Iodozyme 401 and then Oxyzyme) was the same regardless of the target species. CONCLUSION: The novel hydrogel skin surface wound dressings are broad-spectrum in activity, encompassing antibiotic-resistant organisms, anaerobes and yeasts; their antimicrobial function appears to be rapidly effective.
TI  - In vitro method to assess the antimicrobial activity and potential efficacy of novel types of wound dressings.
AB  - AIMS: To develop a simple, reproducible in vitro static diffusion method using cellulose disks and defined species to test antimicrobial efficacy of wound dressings. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cellulose disks were inoculated by immersion in cell suspensions of target species Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Test and control wound dressings were cut into equal sized squares (25 x 25 mm) and applied to the surface of 10-mm thick tryptone yeast extract agar on test beds. Following a 2-h equilibration period, inoculated cellulose disks were inserted (one per dressing) at the interface between dressing and agar surface and a small weight applied over each square. At various sampling times, disks were removed and surviving cells enumerated by viable counts. Disk to disk variation for microbial loading was assessed using S. epidermidis for both initial (n = 16) and standard treatment (n = 16) conditions. The coefficient of variation was low (<5%) indicating good reproducibility for cell loading and treatment position on the test bed. Replicate assays (n = 6) using S. epidermidis and oxyzyme gels produced similar kill rates with low scatter (R2 > 0.9) indicating good reproducibility between assays. Significant differences (P < 0.05) in kill rates were observed for different target species, types of dressing and test bed conditions (+/-blood and nutrients). CONCLUSIONS: The method is reproducible and useful in tracking the death kinetics of test species, enabling the comparison of different types of dressing. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The reported method has significant advantages over established test procedures; it can be applied equally across a wide range of target species (including anaerobes and yeasts), a wide range of conditions, and different types of surface dressings, including those relying upon oxygen diffusion.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of various micro-organisms on the growth of Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - AIMS: To examine the in vitro influence of various bacteria species on Helicobacter pylori (Hp) growth. METHODS AND RESULTS: The effects of 29 micro-organisms on 31 Hp strains were determined using two modified 'cross streak' methods. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Clostridium difficile showed the strongest inhibition. The inhibitory effects varied, depending on the bacteria spp. and Hp strains, and were method dependent. The cagA status of Hp strains did not correlate with the extent of inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: Helicobacter pylori is inhibited by a significant number of commensal bacteria species as well as opportunistic human pathogens. The success and progress of Hp infection may be influenced by the bacterial flora present, while the difficulty in cultivating Hp from the oral mucosa and faeces may be the result of antagonistic bacterial interaction. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides valuable data on the sensitivity of Hp to a variety of intestinal and oral commensals as well as opportunistic human pathogens. Hp's varying pathogenicity and the specific localization of infection may be the result of these sensitivities. These results can also serve as a basis for further studies to identify the inhibitory substances and make them available for therapeutic use.
TI  - Innate immune response of oral and foreskin keratinocytes: utilization of different signaling pathways by various bacterial species.
AB  - The innate immune response is critical for the epithelial antimicrobial barrier.  The human beta-defensins are small, cationic antimicrobial peptides that are made by epithelial cells and that play a role in mucosal and skin defenses. Human beta-defensin 1 (hBD-1) is expressed constitutively in epithelial tissues, whereas hBD-2 and hBD-3 are expressed in response to bacterial stimuli or inflammation. Previous studies showed that hBD-2 was induced by Fusobacterium nucleatum cell wall extract without the involvement of the NF-kappaB transcription factors, which typically are associated with innate immunity and inflammation. The goal of this study was to characterize signaling pathways involved in hBD-2 induction in response to commensal and pathogenic bacteria. Cultured human oral and foreskin keratinocytes were treated separately with inhibitors of NF-kappaB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 and then stimulated with oral commensal Streptococcus gordonii, oral pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, skin commensal Staphylococcus epidermidis, or skin pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes. Different bacteria induced different levels of hBD-2 and in response to the various inhibitors tested, although certain common patterns were observed for commensal- and pathogen-stimulated cells. hBD-2 induction by all bacteria tested was partially or completely blocked by inhibitors of the JNK and p38 pathways. However, in addition, hBD-2 induction by pathogenic bacteria in both oral and foreskin keratinocytes was blocked by inhibitors of NF-kappaB. The results indicate that commensal and pathogenic bacteria utilize different pathways in hBD-2 induction and suggest that epithelial cells from different body sites have common signaling mechanisms to distinguish between commensal and pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Two cases of diskitis attributable to anaerobic bacteria in children.
AB  - Diskitis, an inflammation of the intervertebral disk, is generally attributable to Staphylococcus aureus and rarely Staphylococcus epidermidis, Kingella kingae, Enterobacteriaciae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In many cases, no bacterial growth is obtained from infected intervertebral discs. Although anaerobic bacteria were recovered from adults with spondylodiscitis, these organisms were not reported before from children. The recovery of anaerobic bacteria in 2 children with diskitis is reported. Patient 1. A 10-year-old male presented with 6 weeks of low back pain and 2 weeks of low-grade fever and abdominal pain. Physical examination was normal except for tenderness to percussion over the spine between thoracic vertebra 11 and lumbar vertebra 2. The patient had a temperature of 104 degrees F. Laboratory tests were within normal limits, except for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), which was 58 mm/hour. Blood culture showed no growth. Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast revealed minimal inflammatory changes in the 12th thoracic vertebra/first lumbar vertebra disk. There was no other abnormality. A computed tomography (CT)-guided aspiration of the disk space yielded bloody material, which was sent for aerobic and anaerobic cultures. Gram stain showed numerous white blood cells and Gram-positive cocci in chains. Cultures for anaerobic bacteria yielded heavy growth of Peptostreptococcus magnus, which was susceptible to penicillin, clindamycin, and vancomycin. The patient was treated with intravenous penicillin 600 000 units every 6 hours for 3 weeks, and then oral amoxicillin, 500 mg every 6 hours for 3 weeks. The back pain resolved within 2 weeks, and the ESR returned to normal at the end of therapy. Follow-up for 3 years showed complete resolution of the infection. Patient 2. An 8-year-old boy presented with low back pain and low-grade fever, irritability, and general malaise for 10 days. He had had an upper respiratory tract infection with sore throat 27 days earlier, for which he received no therapy. The patient had a temperature of 102 degrees F, and physical examination was normal except for tenderness to percussion over the spine between the second and fourth lumbar vertebrae. Laboratory tests were normal, except for the ESR (42 mm/hour). Radiographs of the spine showed narrowing of the third to fourth lumbar vertebra disk space and irregularity of the margins of the vertebral endplates. A CT scan revealed a lytic bone lesion at lumbar vertebra 4, and bone scan showed an increase uptake of (99m)technetium at the third to fourth lumbar vertebra disk space. CT-guided aspiration of the disk space yielded cloudy nonfoul-smelling material, which was sent for aerobic and anaerobic cultures. Gram stain showed numerous white blood cells and fusiform Gram-negative bacilli. Anaerobic culture grew light growth of Fusobacterium nucleatum. The organism produced beta-lactamase and was susceptible to ticarcillin-clavulanate, clindamycin, metronidazole, and imipenem. Therapy with clindamycin 450 mg every 8 hours was given parenterally for 3 weeks and orally for 3 weeks. Back pain resolved within 2 weeks. A 2-year follow-up showed complete resolution and no recurrence. This report describes, for the first time, the isolation of anaerobic bacteria from children with diskitis. The lack of their recovery in previous reports and the absence of bacterial growth in over two third of these studies may be caused by the use of improper methods for their collection, transportation, and cultivation. Proper choice of antimicrobial therapy for diskitis can be accomplished only by identification of the causative organisms and its antimicrobial susceptibility. This is of particular importance in infections caused by anaerobic bacteria that are often resistant to antimicrobials used to empirically treat diskitis. This was the case in our second patient, who was infected by F nucleatum, which was resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. The origin of the anaerobic bacteria causing the infection in our patient is probably of endogenous nature. The presence of abdominal pain in the first child may have been attributable to a subclinical abdominal pathothology. The preceding pharyngitis in the second patient may have been associated with a potential hematogenous spread of F nucleatum. P magnus has been associated with bone and joint infections. This report highlights the importance of obtaining disk space culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from all children with diskitis. Future prospective studies are warranted to elucidate the role of anaerobic bacteria in diskitis in children.
TI  - Superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis in children, caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to present the microbiology and clinical features of six children with superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis (SST) caused by anaerobic bacteria. METHODS: A retrospective review of microbiological and clinical data was undertaken. RESULTS: Anaerobic bacteria alone were recovered in four instances, and they were mixed with facultative bacteria in two. There were 12 bacterial isolates (10 anaerobic and 2 facultatives). The bacteria were Peptostreptococcus species (four isolates), Prevotella species (three), and one isolate each of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. SST at an intravenous infusion site developed in all but one patient. One patient sustained trauma to the leg, and cellulitis developed. Anaerobes of oral origin (Prevotella and Fusobacterium species) were recovered in scalp vein SST, and of gastrointestinal origin (Bacteroides fragilis) in a lower extremity SST. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in children with SST.
TI  - Enzymatic removal and disinfection of bacterial biofilms.
AB  - Model biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas  fluorescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were made on steel and polypropylene substrata. Plaque-resembling biofilms of Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, and Fusobacterium nucleatum were made on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. The activity of enzymes against bacterial cells in biofilm was measured by fluorescence microscopy and an indirect conductance test in which evolution of carbon dioxide was measured. Glucose oxidase combined with lactoperoxidase was bactericidal against biofilm bacteria but did not remove the biofilm from the substrata. A complex mixture of polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes was able to remove bacterial biofilm from steel and polypropylene substrata but did not have a significant bactericidal activity. Combining oxidoreductases with polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes resulted in bactericidal activity as well as removal of the biofilm.
TI  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans on denture surfaces.
AB  - Infectious diseases caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA,  and Candida albicans are often serious in compromised hosts. We enumerated MRSA and C. albicans on denture surfaces and in saliva samples from 29 adults. Staphylococcus species, MRSA, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, MRSE, were detected on 17, 3, and 1 of the 29 denture surfaces, respectively. C. albicans were detected on 22 denture surfaces. All saliva samples from patients whose dentures carried Staphylococcus species and C. albicans were also found to contain both microorganisms. Adherence of isolated 3H labeled cells of MRSA and C. albicans to resin beads and saliva-coated resin beads was examined. Cells of both microorganisms adhered in significantly higher numbers to saliva-coated resin beads than to resin beads. The hydrophobicity of the MRSA isolated from denture surfaces varied from strain to strain; that of C. albicans strains was moderately high. The zeta potentials of MRSA isolates and of C. albicans isolates determined in KCI buffer were significantly low. The potential of the resin beads decreased after treatment with saliva. Two out of 5 MRSA strains were found to be inhibited in growth by oral Streptococcus, Actinomyces, and gram-negative bacterial strains, suggesting that some oral bacterial species play a role in inhibiting the colonization of Staphylococcus species. No isolates of C. albicans were inhibited in their growth by any of the oral bacteria tested. Isolates of MRSA and C. albicans coaggregated with Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum strains. Using denture cleaners every night for 2 weeks did not reduce numbers of Staphylococcus species or C. albicans organisms in saliva.
TI  - The interference of gingival cell cultures with growth of selected bacteria.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to analyze the interference of oral tissue cells or cell lines (effector cells) with growth of reference bacteria, and furthermore to investigate whether cells derived from different individuals differ in such activity. The reference bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The effector cells used were gingival fibroblasts (GF) from 21 periodontally involved persons, gingival epithelial cells (E) from 2 such persons, HeLa cells (HeLa), and an amnion cell line (Amnion). The cells were cultivated and their supernatants tested for antibacterial activity in a Bioscreen robot analyzer (Labsystems, Finland). Results suggest that the antibacterial activity of each tested primary cell line of tissue had its own profile depending on cell type and donor, and that the composition of oral microbiota was influenced by oral cells, which might, in turn, contribute to the variations in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  - In addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. This investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol, Super EBA and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria Streptococcus fecalis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus species, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli B and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, Prevotella (Bacteroides) buccae, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella (Bacteroides) intermedia, Prevotella (Bacteroides) melaninogenica, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. After growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees C. Impregnated discs with the Super EBA liquid were used as positive controls. The antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and Scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials. Impregnated discs with Super EBA liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. Both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. Mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. Zinc oxide-eugenol and Super EBA pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Bacterial interference in vitro. Comparison between a quantitative kinetic and a  cocultivation blood agar test method.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to compare two methods for estimation of bacterial growth interference between various bacteria using a Bioscreen robot analyzer, allowing kinetic documentation, and a cocultivation test on blood agar plates. Six laboratory strains with different virulence and growth requirements were used: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus mitis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The interference activity was correlated with a reference system of Streptococcus sanguis (strain alpha 89) and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococci, GAS serotypes T 9 and T 22). The methods used and results obtained were as follows: 1. Estimation of synergistic and antagonistic bacterial interferences using a Bioscreen robot analyzer. Suspensions of viable bacteria were added to microtiter plates with different concentrations of UV light-killed bacteria in liquid media. The Bioscreen analyzer monitored bacterial growth every 10 min for 24 h giving kinetic data during the growth period. Synergisms as well as antagonisms were demonstrated between the tested bacterial strains which have not earlier been reported in the literature. However, the antagonistic effect observed between the six strains was less than that induced by the S. sanguis strain on the two strains of S. pyogenes. 2. Cocultivation of bacterial strains on blood agar surface with precultivated or simultaneously stamped interfering bacteria indicated no detectable interference between the six tested bacterial strains, while the S. sanguis strain inhibited the growth of S. pyogenes strains as well as the hemolysis around the colonies. The Bioscreen method was found more sensitive for testing bacterial interference compared to the commonly used blood agar test.
TI  - Cytotoxicity in bacterial cultures: interaction and cell-specificity, possible factors in periodontal disease.
AB  - Cytotoxicity in culture media of various growing bacterial strains was estimated  by Cr-51 release of labelled target-cells. Interaction studies were made by adding each of the different UV-killed bacteria to the medium with viable bacteria. The reference oral bacterial strains were: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus mitis, which were compared with the reference bacteria Staphylococcus aureus 209 and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The target cells were: gingival fibroblasts (GF), periodontal membrane fibroblasts (PMF), pulpal fibroblasts (PF), HeLa-cells (HeLa), and lymphoid neoplasm cells (LN). Synergistic, as well as antagonistic, effects on target cells were observed. The cytotoxicity of A. actinomycetemcomitans in presence of P. gingivalis is neutralized while in presence of S. aureus it was increased. Bacterial interactions with F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis cytotoxicity were observed. The cytotoxicity of F. nucleatum was increased when cultured together with A. actinomycetemcomitans. Each cell type reacted differently to the toxicity of the supernatant of growth medium in which the same bacterial strain had been cultivated, which indicates cell specificity of the toxins.
TI  - Comparison of the effects of galactose and glucose on the pH responses of human dental plaque, salivary sediment and pure cultures of oral bacteria.
AB  - Comparisons made in dental plaque in vivo demonstrated that galactose produces a  significantly smaller decrease in pH than does glucose. In vitro studies with plaque, salivary sediment and pure cultures of oral bacteria done in the absence of intraoral factors such as flowing saliva confirmed this lesser acidogenicity of galactose. Pure culture showed that most of the bacteria tested produce a moderate to large decrease with glucose but only a few do so with galactose; most produced a moderate to little or no pH response with this sugar. This suggested that the smaller decreases in pH seen in plaque in vivo with galactose were largely due to bacterial differences, basically that resident micro-organisms individually have less galactolytic than glucolytic capability. Variance in capability was attributed to differences in membrane transport processes and metabolic pathways normally available to bacteria for galactose and glucose catabolism. In the in vitro experiments, because plaque and sediment can produce base as readily as they can produce acid, the nitrogenous substrates identified earlier as major stimulants of base formation, urea and arginine, were concurrently examined for their attenuating effects on the galactose and glucose pH responses. These showed, consistent with its lesser acidogenicity, that galactose could be countered more readily in its ability to reduce the pH by either of these two base-forming substrates than could glucose. The effects were different with urea and with arginine, urea attenuation occurred sooner and arginine attenuation later in both plaque and sediment. The corresponding acid-base pH profiles for pure cultures were different.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  - Two unique forms of periodontal disease, HIV-gingivitis and HIV-periodontitis, have been described in patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). In order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in AIDS patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 AIDS patients with periodontitis. The presence of putative periodontal pathogens including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides intermedius, Porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly B. gingivalis), and Wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 AIDS patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. Of 666 bacterial strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, Streptococcus sanguis II was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by Lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (12%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), Actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and Actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). Fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. Enteric species including Enterococcus avium and Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium clostridiiforme and Clostridium difficle as well as Klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. Immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of A. actinomycetemcomitans, B. intermedius, and P. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four times more periodontitis patients demonstrated W. recta. Subgingival yeast was a frequent finding in these AIDS patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. This study indicates that subgingival plaque in AIDS patients with periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-HIV infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.
TI  - Bacteriology of dental abscesses of endodontic origin.
AB  - Aspirates have been cultured from 10 dental abscesses of endodontic origin, all of which had penetrated beyond the bony alveolus to produce fluctuant swelling. Sampling was by syringe aspiration. Strict anaerobic techniques, including the use of an anaerobic chamber, were used for serial dilution and plating. Randomly selected colonies (100) from each culture were purified, characterized, and identified. Seventy percent of the bacterial isolates were either strict anaerobes or microaerophilic. One abscess yielded a pure culture of a viridans streptococcus, Streptococcus milleri. Streptococcus intermedius dominated the flora in a second abscess. The common oral streptococcus, Streptococcus sanguis, constituted only 2% of the isolates from one additional infection. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, other Bacteroides including B. oralis and B. ruminicola, anaerobic diphtheroids, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Staphylococcus epidermis were other predominant isolates.
TI  - Production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from Staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  - Staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. These strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of Staphylococcus aureus FDA209P. The frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. Strain IYS2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. IYS2 was identified to be S. aureus, based on its biological properties. The bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. Its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. The isoelectric point was 10.0. In amino acid composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. The bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. The bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. An analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that Streptococcus salivarius, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium parvulum, and Actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacterionema matruchotii, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. The majority of S. aureus tested were susceptible, and all Staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of burns in children.
AB  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of burn sites in 180 children were monitored. Specimens were obtained twice a week; each patient had between one and 21 cultures taken (mean 2.4). A total of 392 specimens were collected over 2 years, of which 319 were positive. Aerobic bacteria alone were present in 225 specimens (71%) and anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 26 (8%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were present in 68 burn specimens (21%). A total of 580 isolates (448 aerobes and 132 anaerobes) were recovered, accounting for 1.8 isolates per specimen (1.4 aerobes and 0.4 anaerobes). The predominant aerobic isolates were S. epidermidis, S. aureus, alpha hemolytic streptococcus, Pseudomonas sp., and Group D streptococcus. The predominant anaerobic isolates were: P. acnes, anaerobic Gram-positive cocci, and Bacteroides sp. Blood cultures were drawn from 45 children: four showed bacterial growth of one of each of the following isolates: S. aureus, E. coli, Peptococcus asaccharolyticus, and B. fragilis. The numbers of isolates per specimen were higher in the oral and anal area (3.2 and 2.8) than in the extremities and trunk (1.8 and 0.9). Gram-negative enteric rods and Group D streptococci were more frequently recovered from the anal area. S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and P. acnes were more frequently recovered from extremities. Bacteroides sp. and Fusobacterium nucleatum were more frequently recovered from the anal and oral areas. All children were treated with local application of silver sulfadiazine, and antimicrobial therapy was used in 128 children. Statistical analysis showed no correlation between the bacteria isolated and use of antimicrobial agents. These data suggest a role for anaerobic bacteria in the colonization of burns in children, especially in burns of the anal and oral areas.
TI  - Effects of storage in an anaerobic transport system on bacteria in known polymicrobial mixtures and in clinical specimens.
AB  - An anaerobic transport system (ATS) which provides for catalytic removal of oxygen was evaluated by using in vitro-prepared polymicrobial mixtures of logphase bacteria and clinical specimens. Inoculated swabs were stored at room temperature in (i) aerobic, (ii) anaerobic glove box, and (iii) ATS environments, and bacteria were quantitated after 2, 24, 48, and 72 h. Bacteria in a three-part mixture of Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Escherichia coli and in a five-part mixture of B. fragilis, P. anaerobius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa survived 72 h of storage in the ATS and anaerobic glove box environments, but the anaerobic species were inactivated in the aerobic storage except for B. fragilis in pure culture or in the three-part mixture. Changes in relative proportions among the species in a mixture were least in the ATS and anaerobic glove box environments and greatest during the aerobic storage, particularly in the five-part mixture. Bacteria present in pure or mixed culture in clinical specimens generally survived 72 h of storage in the ATS. These data indicate that changes in relative proportions occur with prolonged storage even under anaerobic conditions, but that the ATS would be most effective for preserving anaerobic bacteria and preventing drastic concentration changes and overgrowth of facultative and aerobic bacteria.
