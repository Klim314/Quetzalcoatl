TI  == influence of long-term consumption of a lactococcus lactis strain on the intestinal immunity and intestinal flora of the senescence-accelerated mouse.
AB  == the senescence-accelerated mouse develops normally until 5-6 months of age and then displays rapid and irreversible advancement of senescence manifesting as clinical signs and gross lesions. to clarify the effect of lactic acid bacteria on the physiological changes with increasing age, heat-killed lactococcus lactis  g50 was administered to 1-month-old senescence-accelerated-prone mouse (samp)6 mice for 11 months, a senescence-accelerated mouse strain that develops senile osteoporosis. mice fed g50 gained more weight than the control mice (not fed g50) during the feeding experiment. faecal iga levels in the mice fed g50 at 3 months  were higher than those of the control mice but decreased to control levels with increasing age. the numbers of viable cells of bacteroides sp., lactobacillus sp., staphylococcus sp., enterococcus/streptococcus sp. and enterobacteriaceae sp. in faeces were similar for mice fed the g50 and control diets at any age, but strain g50 suppressed the intestinal growth of h2s-producing bacteria. bone density of the thigh bone did not differ between aged g50 and control mice. strain g50 would be a beneficial bacterium for the enhancement of intestinal immunity during youth and to suppress the growth of harmful intestinal bacteria.  the applicability of strain g50 for the food and animal industries has been proposed in the present study.

TI  == anti-ageing effect of a lactococcal strain: analysis using senescence-accelerated mice.
AB  == the effects of oral administration of a lactococcal strain on physiological changes associated with ageing were investigated using senescence-accelerated mice (sam). sam develop normally, but then show an early onset and irreversible advancement of senescence. samp6 is a sam strain that develops osteoporosis with  ageing. oral administration of heat-killed lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris h61 (strain h61) to aged samp6 mice was associated with reduced bone density loss, a  suppression of incidence of skin ulcers and reduced hair loss, compared with controls. spleen cells from mice fed strain h61 produced more interferon-gamma and il-12 than those from control mice, suggesting that administration of strain  h61 altered immune responses. the numbers of viable cells of bifidobacterium sp., bacteroides sp. and enterococcus sp. in faeces were similar for mice fed the strain h61 and control diets, but counts for staphylococcus sp. were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in mice fed strain h61. mice fed strain h61 had similar serum concentrations of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances as in controls, indicating a lack of effect on lipid peroxidation status. administration of living cells of strain h61 or fermented milk containing strain  h61 was also associated with a suppression of incidence of skin ulcers and reduced hair loss. these results indicate that oral administration of strain h61  has the potential to suppress some of the manifestations associated with ageing.

TI  == study of gene transfer in vitro and in the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice from lactococcus lactis strains to various strains belonging to human intestinal  flora.
AB  == the use of genetically modified organisms (gmo) in dairy products requires evaluation of the dna transfer capacity from such organisms among the human intestinal microflora. thus, both in vitro and in vivo [in the digestive tract (dt) of mice] transfer from lactococcus lactis donor strains of the conjugative plasmid pil205 (cmr) and the non-conjugative plasmid pil253 (emr) to: (1) recipient strains isolated from human faecal flora bacteroides sp., bifidobacterium sp., peptostreptococcus sp. (strictly anaerobic bacterial strains) and enterococcus faecalis, (2) a whole human faecal flora, was studied.  in both cases, no gene transfer was observed to strictly anaerobic bacterial strains. dna transfer was only observed to the e. faecalis strain: in vivo cmr e. faecalis transconjugants were isolated from sequentially multi-associated mice and when the recipient strains associated with the mice, they were a defined mixture of bacteroides sp., bifidobacterium sp., peptostreptococcus sp. and e. faecalis strains. when mice were associated with the whole human faecal flora, the plasmid pil205 was transferred into some facultative anaerobic streptococci.  it was also shown that dna transfer occurred even when the lactococcal donor strain was transient in the dt of the gnotobiotic host animals.
