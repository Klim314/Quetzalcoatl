TI  == [infection due to mycobacterium bovis in common variable immunodeficiency].
AB  == common variable immunodeficiency (cvid) is an heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by impaired antibody production. it shows a wide spectrum of manifestations including severe and recurrent respiratory infections (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus) and gastrointestinal (campylobacter jejuni, rotavirus and giardia lamblia). viral infections caused by herpes zoster, cytomegalovirus (cmv) and hepatitis c are rare. the opportunistic agents such as  cmv, pneumocystis jirovecii, cryptococcus and atypical mycobacteria have been reported as isolated cases. this paper reports the case of a 38-year-old female patient, who began six years before with weight loss of 7 kg in six months, fatigue, weakness, sweating, fever and abdominal pain. furthermore, patient had intestinal obstruction and abdominal ct showed mesenteric lymph growth. the mesenteric lymph node biopsy revealed positives mycobacterium pcr, ziehl-neelsen  staining and culture for m. bovis. in the laparotomy postoperative period was complicated with nosocomial pneumonia, requiring mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy. two years later, she developed right renal abscess that required surgical drainage, once again with a positive culture for mycobacterium bovis. she was referred to highly specialized hospital and we documented panhypogammaglobulinemia and lymphopenia. secondary causes of hypogammaglobulinemia were ruled out and common variable immunodeficiency (cvid)  was confirmed, we started ivig replacement. four years later she developed mixed  cellularity hodgkin's lymphoma. until today she continues with ivig and chemotherapy. this report of a patient with cvid and mycobacterium bovis infection, a unusual association, shows the cellular immunity susceptibility in this immunodeficiency, additional to the humoral defect.

TI  == [recurrent meningitis due to anatomical defects: the bacteria indicates its origin].
AB  == introduction: recurrent meningitis is a rare disease. anatomical abnormalities and immunodeficiency states are predisposing factors. four cases, in which immunodeficiency was excluded, are presented. the causal microorganism led to the detection of the anatomical defect responsible for the recurrences. patients and  methods: retrospective review of 4 cases with clinical diagnosis of recurrent bacterial meningitis. results: case 1: a thirty month-old boy with unilateral hearing loss, diagnosed with mondini abnormality by magnetic resonance imaging (mri) after 2 episodes of haemophilus influenzae meningitis. surgical repair after third recurrence. case 2: fourteen year-old girl diagnosed by mri with cribriform plate defect after 3 episodes of meningitis due to streptococcus pneumoniae. ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed. case 3: girl with meningitis due to staphylococcus aureus at 2 and 7 months. mri shows occipital dermal sinus  requiring excision. complication with cerebellar abscesses because of a coexisting dermoid cyst. case 4: child with meningitis due to streptococcus bovis at 9 days and enterococcus faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli at 7 months, with positive cultures to citrobacter freundii and e. faecium later on. spinal mri led to the diagnosis of currarino syndrome with csf fistula, which was surgically repaired. the 4 patients had undergone image studies reported as normal during the first episodes. conclusions: in patients with recurrent meningitis the possibility of an anatomical defect should be considered. the isolated microorganism should help to locate it. it is essential to know the normal flora of the different anatomical sites. the definitive treatment is usually surgical.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == insight into the evolution of the histidine triad protein (htp) family in streptococcus.
AB  == the histidine triad proteins (htps), also known as pht proteins in streptococcus  pneumoniae, constitute a family of surface-exposed proteins that exist in many pathogenic streptococcal species. although many studies have revealed the importance of htps in streptococcal physiology and pathogenicity, little is known about their origin and evolution. in this study, after identifying all htp homologs from 105 streptococcal genomes representing 38 different species/subspecies, we analyzed their domain structures, positions in genome, and most importantly, their evolutionary histories. by further projecting this information onto the streptococcal phylogeny, we made several major findings. first, htp genes originated earlier than the streptococcus genus and gene-loss events have occurred among three streptococcal groups, resulting in the absence of the htp gene in the bovis, mutans and salivarius groups. second, the copy number of htp genes in other groups of streptococcus is variable, ranging from one to four functional copies. third, both phylogenetic evidence and domain structure analyses support the division of two htp subfamilies, designated as htp i and htp ii. although present mainly in the pyogenic group and in streptococcus  suis, htp ii members are distinct from htp i due to the presence of an additional leucine-rich-repeat domain at the c-terminus. finally, htp genes exhibit a faster nucleotide substitution rate than do housekeeping genes. specifically, the regions outside the htp domains are under strong positive selection. this distinct evolutionary pattern likely helped streptococcus to easily escape from recognition by host immunity.

TI  == [role of infectious agents in the emergence of malignant tumors].
AB  == according to the data of the international agency for research on cancer (iarc),  at least 6 virus species (hpv, ebv, hhv-8/kshv, htlv-1, hbv, hcv), 4 helminthes species (schistosoma haematobium and japonicum, opisthorchis viverrini, clonorchis sinensis) and i bacterium species (helicobacter pylori) have been proved to be capable of causing the development of cancer. the analysis of the data available shows that merkel cell polyomavirus (mcv), herpes simplex virus (hsv), john cunningham polyomavirus (jcv), monkey virus 40 (sv40), cytomegalovirus (cmv), xenotropic murine leukemia virus (xmrv), helicobacter bilis and hepaticus, campylobacter jejuni, fusobacterium varium, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides vulgatus, prevotella spp., streptococcus bovis and anginosus, treponema denticola, salmonella typhi, paratyphi and typhimurium, borrelia burgdorferi, bartonella spp., mycobacterium tuberculosis, chlamydia pneumoniae, trachomatis and psittaci, neisseria gonorrhoeae, propionibacterium acnes, tropheryma whippelii, schistosoma mansoni, opistorchis felineus, strongyloides stercoralis, taenia solium, candida  spp., paracoccidioides brasiliensis, histoplasma capsulatum and trichomonas vaginalis can also be potential etiological agents of cancer. apparently, detection of new associations between infectious agents and risk of the development of cancer will facilitate progress in elaboration of prophylaxis measures, early diagnostic methods and, probably, methods of treatment of malignant tumors.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == the cryptic competence pathway in streptococcus pyogenes is controlled by a peptide pheromone.
AB  == horizontal gene transfer is an important means of bacterial evolution that is facilitated by transduction, conjugation, and natural genetic transformation. transformation occurs after bacterial cells enter a state of competence, where naked dna is acquired from the extracellular environment. induction of the competent state relies on signals that activate master regulators, causing the expression of genes involved in dna uptake, processing, and recombination. all streptococcal species contain the master regulator sigx and sigx-dependent effector genes required for natural genetic transformation; however, not all streptococcal species have been shown to be naturally competent. we recently demonstrated that competence development in streptococcus mutans requires the type ii comrs quorum-sensing circuit, comprising an rgg transcriptional activator and a novel peptide pheromone (l. mashburn-warren, d. a. morrison, and m. j. federle, mol. microbiol. 78:589-606, 2010). the type ii comrs system is shared by the pyogenic, mutans, and bovis streptococci, including the clinically relevant pathogen streptococcus pyogenes. here, we describe the activation of sigx by a small-peptide pheromone and an rgg regulator of the type ii comrs class. we confirm previous reports that sigx is functional and able to activate sigx-dependent gene expression within the competence regulon, and that sigx stability is influenced by the cytoplasmic protease clpp. genomic analyses of available s. pyogenes genomes revealed the presence of intact genes within the competence regulon. while this is the first report to show natural induction of sigx, s. pyogenes remained nontransformable under laboratory conditions. using radiolabeled dna, we demonstrate that transformation is blocked at the stage of dna uptake.

TI  == the role of lactoferrin binding protein b in mediating protection against human lactoferricin.
AB  == bacteria that inhabit the mucosal surfaces of the respiratory and genitourinary tracts of mammals encounter an iron-deficient environment because of iron sequestration by the host iron-binding proteins transferrin and lactoferrin. lactoferrin is also present in high concentrations at sites of inflammation where the cationic, antimicrobial peptide lactoferricin is produced by proteolysis of lactoferrin. several gram-negative pathogens express a lactoferrin receptor that  enables the bacteria to use lactoferrin as an iron source. the receptor is composed of an integral membrane protein, lactoferrin binding protein a (lbpa), and a membrane-bound lipoprotein, lactoferrin binding protein b (lbpb). lbpa is essential for growth with lactoferrin as the sole iron source, whereas the role of lbpb in iron acquisition is not yet known. in this study, we demonstrate that  lbpb from 2 different species is capable of providing protection against the killing activity of a human lactoferrin-derived peptide. we investigated the prevalence of lactoferrin receptors in bacteria and examined their sequence diversity. we propose that the protection against the cationic antimicrobial human lactoferrin-derived peptide is associated with clusters of negatively charged amino acids in the c-terminal lobe of lbpb that is a common feature of this protein.

TI  == rapid identification of bovine mastitis pathogens by high-resolution melt analysis of 16s rdna sequences.
AB  == accurate identification of mastitis pathogens is often compromised when using conventional culture-based methods. here, we report a novel, rapid assay tested for speciation of bacterial mastitis pathogens using high-resolution melt analysis (hrma) of 16s rdna sequences. real-time pcr amplification of 16s rrna gene fragment, spanning the variable region v5 and v6 was performed with a resulting amplicon of 290bp. first, a library was generated of melt curves of 9 common pathogens that are implicated in bovine mastitis. six of the isolates, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus  uberis, staphylococcus aureus and mycoplasma bovis, were type strains while the other 3, arcanobacterium pyogenes, corynebacterium bovis and streptococcus dysgalactiae, were bovine mastitis field isolates. four of the type strains, e. coli, s. agalactiae, k. pneumoniae and s. aureus, were found to be of human origin, while the other 3 type strains were isolated from bovine infections. secondly, the melt curves and corresponding amplicon sequences of a. pyogenes, e. coli, s. agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae, k. pneumoniae, s. uberis and s. aureus were compared with 10 bovine mastitis field isolates of each pathogen. based on the distinct differences in melt curves and sequences between human and bovine isolates of e. coli and k. pneumoniae, it was deemed necessary to select a set of bovine strains for these pathogens to be used as reference strains in the hrma. next, the hrma was validated by three interpreters analyzing the differential clustering pattern of melt curves of 60 bacterial cultures obtained from mastitis milk samples. the three test interpreters were blinded to the culture and sequencing results of the isolates. overall accuracy of the validation assay was  95% as there was difficulty in identifying the streptococci due to heterogeneity  observed in the pcr amplicons of s. uberis. the present study revealed that broad-range real-time pcr with hrma can be used as a powerful, fast and low-cost  tool for the differentiation of clinically important bacterial mastitis pathogens.

TI  == exploring internal features of 16s rrna gene for identification of clinically relevant species of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == background: streptococcus is an economically important genus as a number of species belonging to this genus are human and animal pathogens. the genus has been divided into different groups based on 16s rrna gene sequence similarity. the variability observed among the members of these groups is low and it is difficult to distinguish them. the present study was taken up to explore 16s rrna gene sequence to develop methods that can be used for preliminary identification  and can supplement the existing methods for identification of clinically-relevant isolates of the genus streptococcus. methods: 16s rrna gene sequences belonging to the isolates of s. dysgalactiae, s. equi, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, s. gallolyticus, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. pneumoniae, s. thermophilus and s. anginosus were analyzed with the purpose to define genetic variability within each species to generate a phylogenetic framework, to identify species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. results: the framework based analysis was used to segregate streptococcus spp. previously  identified upto genus level. this segregation was validated using species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. 43 uncharacterized streptococcus spp. could be identified using this approach. conclusions: the markers generated exploring 16s rrna gene sequences provided useful tool that can be further used for identification of different species of the genus streptococcus.

TI  == bacterial meningitis in cirrhotic patients: case series and description of the prognostic role of acute renal failure.
AB  == aim: to analyze the mortality risk factors in cirrhotic patients with bacterial meningitis (bm). background: cirrhotic patients are susceptible to infections. despite its high mortality rate, bm has not been extensively studied in this group of patients. study: bm patients diagnosed with cirrhosis, between 1987 and  2008, were studied. bm was defined as the presence of signs or symptoms of meningitis and a cerebrospinal fluid (csf) leukocyte count >100/mm3 or the presence of bacteria in csf. results: we identified 4955 infections among 7591 cirrhotic patients; 12 (0.2%) had bm. the mean age at diagnosis was 60+/-16 years. abnormal mental status (83%), fever (67%), and neck stiffness (67%) were the most frequent clinical presentations. the sensitivity of csf culture was 75%  (streptococcus pneumoniae, 2; staphylococcus aureus, 2; listeria monocytogenes, 1; group b streptococcus, 1; streptococcus agalactiae, 1; streptococcus bovis, 1; and escherichia coli, 1), and its correlation with blood culture was 78%. five patients died. on admission, the serum creatinine level was 1.63+/-0.93 mg/dl. a  serum creatinine level >/=1.3 mg/dl was associated with increased mortality (p=0.028). the model for end-stage liver disease score, gastrointestinal bleeding, bilirubin level >3.5 mg/dl, hepatic encephalopathy, diabetes mellitus,  and results of cytology and biochemistry tests of csf were not associated with mortality. conclusions: bm in cirrhotic patients is associated with a high mortality rate. the clinical and microbiologic features of bm in cirrhotic patients differ from those in the general population. a serum creatinine level >/=1.3 mg/dl on admission is associated with a higher risk of mortality.

TI  == central nervous system infections in filipino patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.
AB  == background and purpose: infections including those of the central nervous system  (cns) are a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in systemic lupus erythematosus (sle). this case series describes the etiology, contributing factors and outcomes of cns infections in a group of filipino patients with sle.  design: retrospective case series. methods: we reviewed the medical records of sle patients diagnosed and confined for a cns infection at the university of santo tomas hospital in manila, philippines, from 1997 to 2007. results: a total  of 23 sle patients (22 females) diagnosed with cns infection were included in this study. the mean age was 25.8 years (range 12-51) at sle diagnosis, and 30.9  years (range 14-58) at cns infection, with a mean disease duration of 55 months (range 7-125). nineteen cases (82.6%) were meningitis, and four (17.4%) were diagnoses of brain abscess. the etiologic agents were identified as cryptococcus  neoformans in seven (30.4%), mycobacterium tuberculosis in seven (30.4%), streptococcus pneumoniae in two (8.7%), salmonella sp. in one (4.4%), corynebacterium bovis with actinomyces sp. in one (4.4%), and no isolate in five  (21.7%). the average daily prednisone dose was 28.9 mg (range 0-60 mg); 10 patients had recently received pulse cyclophosphamide, and two were on mycophenolate mofetil at the time of infection. most cases had active sle; the lone patient in disease remission had s. pneumoniae meningitis post-splenectomy.  the most common presentation was headache (100%) and fever (87%). the infection resolved completely in nine patients (39.1%), and resolved with sequelae in two patients (8.7%); 12 patients (52.2%) died. conclusion: we described the etiology  and outcomes of cns infections in a group of filipino patients with sle. risk factors included active sle in the majority of cases requiring moderate- to high-dose steroids and other immunosuppressants like cyclophosphamide. although c. neoformans and m. tuberculosis were the most common etiologic agents, it is just as important to search for less common organisms which can produce disease in highly susceptible hosts. a high index of suspicion and early appropriate management are crucial to favorable outcome among these patients.

TI  == partial recn gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus streptococcus.
AB  == partial sequences of the recn gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. the partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. the mean dna sequence similarity of recn gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be  lower than those of the 16s rrna gene (94.1 %), rpob (84.6 %), soda (74.8 %), groel (78.1 %) and gyrb (73.2 %). phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: streptococcus salivarius, s. equinus, s. hyovaginalis/s. pluranimalium/s. thoraltensis, s. pyogenes, s. mutans and s. suis. the 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: streptococcus sanguinis/s. cristatus/s. sinensis, s. anginosus/s. intermedius/s. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and s. mitis/s. infantis/s. peroris/s. oralis/s. oligofermentans/s. pneumoniae/s. pseudopneumoniae. the partial recn gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. this observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groel, gyrb, rpob and soda). a high percentage of similarity was found between s. intermedius and s. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recn gene. to study the genetic  diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recn, groel, soda, gyrb and rpob sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. the results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of five herbal extracts against multi drug resistant (mdr) strains of bacteria and fungus of clinical origin.
AB  == antimicrobial activities of the crude ethanolic extracts of five plants were screened against multidrug resistant (mdr) strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and candida albicans. atcc strains of streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus bovis, pseudimonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and candida albicans were also tested. the strains that showed resistance against the maximum number of antibiotics tested were selected for an antibacterial assay. the mdr strains were sensitive to the antimicrobial activity of acacia nilotica,  syzygium aromaticum and cinnamum zeylanicum, whereas they exhibited strong resistance to the extracts of terminalia arjuna and eucalyptus globulus. community-acquired infections showed higher sensitivity than the nosocomial infections against these extracts. the most potent antimicrobial plant was a. nilotica (mic range 9.75-313 microg/ml), whereas other crude plant extracts studied in this report were found to exhibit higher mic values than a. nilotica against community acquired as well as nosocomial infection. this study concludes  that a. nilotica, c. zeylanicum and s. aromaticum can be used against multidrug resistant microbes causing nosocomial and community acquired infections.

TI  == identification of alpha-hemolytic streptococci by pyrosequencing the 16s rrna gene and by use of vitek 2.
AB  == alpha-hemolytic streptococci are very difficult to identify by phenotypic methods. in this study, a pyrosequencing method for the identification of streptococcal species based on two variable regions of the 16s rrna gene is described. almost all studied streptococcal species (n = 51) represented by their type strains could be differentiated except for some closely related species of the streptococcus bovis or s. salivarius group. the pyrosequencing results of alpha-hemolytic streptococci isolated from blood (n = 99) or from the normal pharyngeal microbiota (n = 25) were compared to the results obtained by the vitek 2 with gp card (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france). as expected, the results of  the two methods did not completely agree, but 93 (75.0%) of the isolates assigned to the same streptococcal group by both methods and 57 (46.0%) reached consistent results at the species level. however, 10 strains remained unidentified by vitek  2, and 4 isolates could not be assigned to any streptococcal group by pyrosequencing. identification of members of the s. mitis and s. sanguinis groups proved difficult for both methods. furthermore, the pyrosequencing analysis revealed great sequence variation, since only 43 (32.3%) of the 133 isolates analyzed by pyrosequencing had sequences identical to a type strain. the variation was greatest in the pharyngeal isolates, slightly lower in the blood culture isolates, and nonexistent in invasive pneumococcal isolates (n = 17) that all had the s. pneumoniae type strain sequence. the resolution of the results obtained by the two methods is impeded by the lack of a proper gold standard.

TI  == [study on treatment strategy for ventriculitis associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus].
AB  == objective: to study the treatment strategy for ventriculitis associated with ventriculo peritoneal shunt for hydrocephalus. methods: for all of the patients suspected to have cerebrospinal fluid (csf) infections, the first step of treatment was removal of the "infected" shunts, then a ventricular drainage was placed in frontal horn of the ventricle, and at the same time csf was obtained from the ventricle for bacterial culture and tests of bacterial sensitivities to  antibiotics. after the shunt removal and before the result from bacterial cultures was obtained, 25-50 mg of vancomycin was administered intraventricularly daily. as soon as the result from bacterial cultures was obtained, antibiotics should be adjusted according to the sensitivity test result. by the time of the infections being controlled, appropriate treatments including reshunting would finally be given for hydrocephalus if necessary. results: among 11 patients, 9 were infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci or staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus, one of them with concomitant infection of aerobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacteriaceae aerogenesis, 1 patient with streptococci, and another one with mycobacterium stercoris bovis. the tests of drug sensitivity showed that cocci in infection of 9 patients were all sensitive  to vancomycin, but only 1 of them sensitive to gentamycin. there were other sensitive antibiotics for streptococcus in 1 case and for bacillus in 2 patients. practically vancomycin was effective for 8 of 11 patients, including one case of  streptococcal infection. the duration for anti-infection treatment was in a range of 16-36 days. finally, all of 11 patients survived from the shunt ventriculitis, and 9 of them had significant improvement in their neurological functions. conclusion: (1)intraventricular administration of proper antibiotics is a reliable and effective way to treat ventriculitis associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunts. (2)vancomycin is the preferred antibiotic for ventriculitis, but other kind(s) of some antibiotics are necessary in a few patients in addition to or instead of vancomycin. (3)the effect of systemic use of antibiotics could not be defined in this series of patients, but this may be used as an adjunct in the practice. (4)there are many problems related to diagnosis and treatment of shunt ventriculitis that should be studied more extensively and deeply.

AB  == objectives: the objective of the study was to examine the characteristics of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (sbp) caused by streptococci, in particular viridans group streptococci (vgs), and to investigate a potential association between the long-term administration of norfloxacin and high-level resistance to  fluoroquinolones in these organisms. methods: we reviewed 84 episodes of sbp and  bacterascites caused by streptococci that occurred in 75 patients over a 6-year period. isolates were tested for antibiotic susceptibility by the determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations. results: of the 84 isolates, 46 (54.8%) were associated with sbp, 12 (14.3%) were associated with symptomatic bacterascites, and 26 (31%) were associated with asymptomatic bacterascites. vgs  were responsible for 39 of the 58 episodes of sbp and symptomatic bacterascites,  largely preceding group b streptococci (n=7), streptococcus pneumoniae (n=6) and  streptococcus bovis (n=5). most of the episodes were community acquired. an extraperitoneal site of infection was found in three patients only. positive blood cultures were less frequent in patients with vgs infection than in those with sbp caused by other streptococci (12.8 versus 52.6%, p<0.001). the rates of  susceptibility to penicillin, amoxicillin and cefotaxime were 84.5, 87.9 and 91.4%, respectively. all isolates, including those from patients receiving norfloxacin, were susceptible to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. conclusions: vgs  are an underestimated cause of sbp in patients with cirrhosis. most isolates are  susceptible to beta-lactam agents and new fluoroquinolones.

TI  == recurrent klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess in a diabetic patient followed by streptococcus bovis endocarditis--occult colon tumor plays an important role.
AB  == klebsiella pneumoniae is the leading cause of liver abscess in diabetic patients  in taiwan. we report the case of a diabetic patient with a history of four episodes of k. pneumoniae liver abscess within 3 years. the patient later developed streptococcus bovis bacteremia originating from a colon tumor with complications of endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and silent splenic abscess. occult  colon tumor may have played an important role in our case, with recurrent infection arising from colonizers of the gastrointestinal tract. as our case shows, the possible association between occult colon tumor and k. pneumoniae liver abscess in diabetic patients should be surveyed.

TI  == wasp- mice exhibit defective immune responses to influenza a virus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and mycobacterium bovis bcg.
AB  == objective: to quantify the immune response of wasp- mice to three different pathogens: influenza a virus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and mycobacterium bovis.  methods: primary and secondary t-cell responses to influenza a virus were quantified via tetramer assays. viral clearance from lung was also measured. lethality of intranasal inoculation with luminescent s. pneumoniae was assessed by dose escalation and direct luminescence imaging. after intravenous inoculation with m. bovis, residual mycobacteria in lung, liver, and spleen were measured by  standard culture methods. results: the reduced secondary t-cell response to influenza a virus correlates with a relative but not absolute loss of splenic t and b cells similar to that seen in clinical wiskott-aldrich syndrome (was), and  slower clearance of virus from lung. the reduced magnitude of the secondary t-cell response correlates with a progressive loss of influenza-specific t cells  after primary inoculation. wasp- mice show an increased susceptibility to lethal  pneumonia after intranasal inoculation with s. pneumoniae, which is among the most frequent causes of clinical complications in was patients. wasp- mice clear  m. bovis bacille calmette-guerin (bcg) more slowly from lung, liver, and spleen.  bone marrow-derived macrophages, however, show normal ex vivo cytokine secretion  in response to m. bovis. conclusions: these results demonstrate that wasp- mice are functionally immunodeficient in regard to three different pathogens, and provide relevant end points for the study of treatment modalities in this model.  they also suggest a specific physiologic mechanism, failure to accumulate memory  t cells, for at least one of the defective immune responses.

AB  == continued emergence of antimicrobial resistances among gram-positive pathogens requires further development of compounds with novel modes of action. the peptide deformylase inhibitor nvp pdf-713 was tested against 1,837 recent strains of gram-positive organisms. all nvp pdf-713 mics were at < or = 4microg/ml except for 6 enterococci (0.3% of strains overall). nvp pdf-713 mic(90) results were: staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic and viridans group streptococci and streptococcus bovis at 1 microg/ml; coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, and listeria spp. at 2 microg/ml; and the enterococci at 4 microg/ml. nvp pdf-713 appears to be a promising new agent worthy of continued in vivo development.

TI  == rpob gene sequence-based identification of aerobic gram-positive cocci of the genera streptococcus, enterococcus, gemella, abiotrophia, and granulicatella.
AB  == we developed a new molecular tool based on rpob gene (encoding the beta subunit of rna polymerase) sequencing to identify streptococci. we first sequenced the complete rpob gene for streptococcus anginosus, s. equinus, and abiotrophia defectiva. sequences were aligned with these of s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. pneumoniae available in genbank. using an in-house analysis program (svarap),  we identified a 740-bp variable region surrounded by conserved, 20-bp zones and,  by using these conserved zones as pcr primer targets, we amplified and sequenced  this variable region in an additional 30 streptococcus, enterococcus, gemella, granulicatella, and abiotrophia species. this region exhibited 71.2 to 99.3% interspecies homology. we therefore applied our identification system by pcr amplification and sequencing to a collection of 102 streptococci and 60 bacterial isolates belonging to other genera. amplicons were obtained in streptococci and bacillus cereus, and sequencing allowed us to make a correct identification of streptococci. molecular signatures were determined for the discrimination of closely related species within the s. pneumoniae-s. oralis-s. mitis group and the s. agalactiae-s. difficile group. these signatures allowed us to design a s. pneumoniae-specific pcr and sequencing primer pair.

TI  == [streptococcus bovis meningitis. an infrequent cause of bacterial meningitis in the adult patient].
AB  == introduction: bacterial meningitis in adult patients, produced by streptococci other than streptococcus pneumoniae, is not common. case report: we report the case of a 74 year old male patient with meningitis and endocarditis due to streptococcus bovis (group d, not enterococcus), sensitive to penicillin (cmi< 0.1 mg/l), with no characteristic clinical or analytical discoveries. a gastrointestinal exploration revealed only diverticles in the colon and two lesions compatible with splenic infarction, observed by using computerised axial  tomography of the abdomen. the patient responded favourably to a four week course of antibiotics; he remained asymptomatic, afebrile and culture negative after the therapy was stopped. conclusions: in many previously reported cases, there is an  association with gastrointestinal illness, endocarditis or oral lesions. gram staining of the cerebrospinal fluid is usually negative and the neurological signs are often subtle. in the case of bacteraemia, endocarditis or s. bovis meningitis, the presence of an underlying pathology of the colon due to the frequent association between these processes must be ruled out. treatment with penicillin g is usually sufficient.

TI  == special issues in the management of infective endocarditis caused by gram-positive cocci.
AB  == gram-positive cocci, mainly streptococci and staphylococci, continue to cause the majority of cases of infective endocarditis. among the streptococci causing ie, the long-standing predominance of oral or viridans-group streptococci has progressively faded, while the number of cases caused by "enteric streptococci" (streptococcus bovis and enterococci) has increased. while most oral streptococci and s. bovis strains remain fully sensitive to penicillin, nutritionally variant  streptococci--now renamed abiotrophia--and enterococci can exhibit resistance to  penicillin and/or glycopeptides that makes endocarditis more difficult to treat.  among the staphylococci causing endocarditis, the increasing proportion of coagulase-negative and methicillin-resistant strains observed in recent years has changed the approach to choice of antibiotic therapy. the purpose of this paper is to focus on some new aspects of the management of antibiotic therapy of ie due to streptococci and staphylococci, including recent developments such as once-daily aminoglycoside administration in ie, outpatient antibiotic therapy, and the evaluation of new antibiotics.

TI  == study of the intra- and interlaboratory reproducibility of partial single base c-sequencing of the 16s rrna gene and its applicability for the identification of members of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == the use of single base c-sequencing of the first 500 bases of the 16s rrna-gene (sbcs) combined with capillary electrophoresis was evaluated for the identification of reference strains of 30 different species within the genus streptococcus. for sbcs, only dd-ctp's are used in the sequencing reactions instead of the four dideoxy bases and the primer is fluorescently labeled. the reproducibility, interlaboratory exchangeability and discriminative power of this method were studied by comparing the patterns obtained in three laboratories under highly standardized conditions. the interlaboratory reproducibility proved  to be high, enabling the construction of a common database for the identification of strains belonging to the streptococcal species studied. most of the examined species generated distinguishable profiles. sbcs did not differentiate between the closely related species s. constellatus and s. intermedius. also s. thermophilus and s. vestibularis as well as s. mitis and s. pneumoniae showed highly resembling profiles. the previously reported heterogeneity within the species s. equinus was reflected by sbcs. for all other species, strains belonging to the same species generated indistinguishable patterns. in conclusion, single base c-sequencing of the first 500 bases of the 16s rrna-gene  could be a useful and widely applicable method for the identification of bacteria at the species level, with the added advantage of being more rapid and easier to  automatize than full sequence determination.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) compared to eleven other antimicrobial agents against streptococcal isolates, excluding streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == the purpose of the study presented here was to determine the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin compared with that of 11 other antimicrobial agents (5 of them quinolones) against 400 isolates of beta-haemolytic and viridans group streptococci. the minimum inhibitory concentration values for gemifloxacin against 90% of the streptococci tested were as follows: lancefield groups a, c and g, 0.06 microg/ml; lancefield group b, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus bovis, 0.125 microg/ml; and streptococcus milleri, 0.03  microg/ml. resistance to penicillin, ampicillin and erythromycin was found mainly in the streptococcus mitis isolates; tetracycline showed variable results, and no vancomycin resistance was encountered. higher rates of ciprofloxacin resistance were identified in the streptococcus bovis, mitis and mutans isolates. in conclusion, gemifloxacin was the most active quinolone tested followed by trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, especially against isolates resistant to beta-lactam agents, macrolides and tetracycline.

TI  == emerging and reemerging pathogens.
AB  == from 1973 to 1995, 29 new and reemerging pathogenic microbes were recognized. however, in discussions about emerging infectious diseases, the focus is often on the clinical effects of the host-parasite relationship, rather than the examination of the biology of the pathogen. many of what we refer to as emerging  diseases are characterized better as 'diseases of human progress'. thus, the aerosolization of water has played an important role in the emergence of legionella pneumophila infections. new diseases are superimposed on endemic diseases such as diarrhoeal diseases, malaria and tuberculosis. in addition, many pathogens are becoming increasingly resistant to standard antimicrobial drugs, making treatment difficult and in some cases impossible. we summarize our experience on emerging parasitic diseases (primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, respiratory cryptosporidiosis, and diplogonoporiasis), and selected problems of bacterial resistance (mdr tuberculosis caused by mycobacterium bovis and macrolide-resistance mechanisms of streptococcus pneumoniae and s. pyogenes).

TI  == streptococcal meningitis in adult patients: current epidemiology and clinical spectrum.
AB  == streptococci other than streptococcus pneumoniae are a rare cause of bacterial meningitis in adults. we report 29 cases of streptococcal meningitis (1977-1997). the patients comprised 19 men and 10 women, with a mean age +/- standard deviation of 47 +/- 18 years. nine cases were secondary to neurosurgical procedures, seven to brain abscess, five to cerebrospinal fluid pericranial fistula, and three to endocarditis. causative microorganisms included the following: viridans group streptococci, 20 cases; anaerobic streptococci, 3; streptococcus agalactiae, 3; streptococcus bovis, 2; and streptococcus pyogenes,  1. four streptococcus mitis strains showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin (mic, 0.5-2 microg/ml). five patients (17%) died. the infection is increasing in  the hospital setting. streptococci resistant to penicillin should be considered in the empirical treatment of nosocomial meningitis. in cases of community-acquired infection, anaerobic streptococci or streptococci of the streptococcus milleri group should alert the clinician to the presence of an undiagnosed brain abscess, whereas oral streptococci of the viridans group suggest the diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of sch27899 (ziracin), a novel everninomicin derivative, tested against streptococcus spp.: disk diffusion/etest method evaluations and quality control guidelines. the quality control study group.
AB  == to combat the increasing rates of penicillin resistance among pneumococci and viridans group streptococci, new gram-positive active agents are needed to avoid  the overuse of vancomycin. sch27899 is an everninomicin derivative with strong activity against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, and penicillin-resistant streptococci. this study tests the in vitro activity of sch27899 against 304 strains of streptococci and evaluates the  quality of the agar dilution, broth microdilution, disk diffusion, and etest methods for this antimicrobial agent. quality-control (qc) ranges for sch27899 are also proposed. sch27899 broth microdilution mics among the penicillin-susceptible and -resistant streptococci tested ranged from < or = 0.008-0.5 microgram/ml. organism groups with their respective mic90s were as follows: streptococcus pneumoniae (100 strains) and beta-haemolytic streptococci  (70 strains), 0.12 microgram/ml; streptococcus bovis (10 strains), 0.25 microgram/ml; and viridans group streptococci (124 strains), 0.5 microgram/ml. etest sch27899 mics correlated well with broth microdilution mics (92% +/- one log2 dilution, 98% +/- two log2 dilutions). agar dilution sch27899 mics correlated well with broth microdilution mics, but a shift toward slightly higher agar dilution mics was attributed to difficulties in reading trailing endpoints with this method. three concentrations (2.5, 5, and 10 micrograms) of sch27899 were used for the disk diffusion method with small inhibition zone diameters (range, 11 to 19 mm) and limited variation between diameters (+/- 2 mm) as a result, both products of this compound's high molecular weight and poor diffusion through agar mediums. proposed control ranges for sch27899 when testing s. pneumoniae atcc 49619 from a nine-center (30 tests per center) quality-control trial are < or = 0.016 to 0.032 microgram/ml for etest, and 0.008 to 0.032 microgram/ml for broth microdilution tests from an earlier study. because of the  limited diffusion ability and bacteriostatic nature of sch27899, mics should be read at 80% of inhibition with agar in vitro systems (etest, agar dilution), and  the disk diffusion method is not recommended.

TI  == correlation between quinolone susceptibility patterns and sequences in the a and  b subunits of dna gyrase in mycobacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activities of seven quinolones and the sequences of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdr) in the a and b subunits of dna gyrase were  determined for 14 mycobacterial species. on the basis of quinolone activity, quinolones were arranged from that with the greatest to that with the least activity as follows: sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, flumequine, and nalidixic acid. based on mics, the species could be organized into three groups: resistant (mycobacterium avium, m. intracellulare, m. marinum, m. chelonae, m. abscessus [ofloxacin mics, >/=8 microg/ml]), moderately susceptible (m. tuberculosis, m. bovis bcg, m. kansasii, m. leprae, m. fortuitum third biovariant, m. smegmatis [ofloxacin mics, 0.5 to 1 microg/ml]), and susceptible (m. fortuitum, m. peregrinum, m. aurum [ofloxacin mics, </=0.25 microg/ml]). peptide sequences of the qrdr of gyrb were identical in all the species, including the amino acids at the three positions known to be involved in acquired resistance to quinolone, i.e., 426 (asp), 447 (arg), and 464 (asn) (numbering system used for escherichia coli). the last two residues could be involved in the overall low level of susceptibility of mycobacteria to quinolones since they differ from those found in the very susceptible e. coli (lys-447 and ser-464) but are identical to those found in the less susceptible staphylococcus  aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. peptide sequences of the qrdr of gyra were identical in all the species, except for the amino acid at position 83, which was an alanine in the two less susceptible groups and a serine in the most susceptible one, as in e. coli, suggesting that this amino acid is involved in the observed differences of quinolone susceptibility within the mycobacterium genus.

AB  == strain differentiation of staphylococcus species, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, and candida species was performed by restriction endonuclease analysis (rea) of genomic dna with hinfi or haeiii followed by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis. rea of 19 methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates and 19 methicillin-susceptible s. aureus isolates revealed 8, and 14 patterns, respectively. fifty-three isolates of s. epidermidis were divided into 39 groups on the basis of rea pattern. rea patterns obtained from different strains of the same species were more similar than those  from different staphylococcus species. a total of 67 patterns were noted among 215 s. pneumoniae isolates. there was some correlation between the rea patterns and serotypes. in addition, all 61 isolates showing the pattern 6 (serotype 19) were penicillin-resistant. sixteen isolates of e. coli o157 and 18 isolates of e. coli o25 were analyzed by rea with haeiii. among 14 epidemiologically unrelated e. coli o157:h7 isolates, rea patterns were either identical or differed only by  a few fragment bands. rea patterns of 7 isolates of heat stable enterotoxin producing e. coli o25 from an outbreak were identical. eight distinct rea patterns were noted among 7 toxigenic c. difficile strains, and one to two strains were included in each group. candida strains belonging to different six candida species were analysed by rea. all c. albicans isolates (148 strains) showed one to four bright bands ranging from 4 to 8kb in size, and these strains  were divided into 37 groups according to the rea patterns. each candida strain showed species-specific rea patterns. twenty-one isolates of mycobacterium tuberculosis complex were analyzed by pcr with primer complementary to the inverted repeat of is6110(is6110-pcr). the results of pcr of 19 m. tuberculosis isolates and 2 m. bovis bcg isolates revealed 15 patterns, and 1 pattern, respectively. our results demonstrated that rea of genomic dna with hinfi or haeiii was a useful tool for strain differentiation. by comparing the species-specific rea patterns of reference strains, clinical isolates of candida  and staphylococci could be identified to the species level if they could not be identified by routine biochemical methods. because is6110-pcr is simple and rapid to perform, it seems to be a good screening method to differentiate m. tuberculosis strains.

TI  == polymerase chain reaction of bacterial genomes with single universal primer: application to distinguishing mycobacteria species.
AB  == the polymerase chain reaction with a single universal primer (up-pcr) was applied to bacterial strains and mycobacteria isolates alongside conventional methods. a  universal protocol of preparation of pcr samples from cultures representing escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, mycobacterium tuberculosis, mycobacterium bovis, and several non-tuberculous mycobacteria was found to be reproducible and efficient with these organisms. the bands of up-pcr  products observed in an agarose gel after electrophoresis were species-specific and provided an efficient means of distinguishing bacterial species. the applicability of this approach to mycobacteria identification was assessed by comparing the dna bands obtained for different strains. three reference strains and 22 clinical isolates of m. tuberculosis and m. bovis produced very similar dna banding patterns. they comprised a triplet of prominent and several minor fragments within the 200-500 base pair (bp) size range and were the easiest to interpret. the dna profiles of unrelated mycobacteria clearly differed from each  other when subjected to electrophoretic analysis and correlated well with results of culture method. the method provides a real promise of its application in clinical studies as a simple assay for distinguishing between tubercle bacilli.

TI  == protective humoral response against pneumococcal infection in mice elicited by recombinant bacille calmette-guerin vaccines expressing pneumococcal surface protein a.
AB  == pneumococcal surface protein a (pspa), a cell-surface protein present on all strains of pneumococci, has been shown to elicit protective antibody responses in mice in the absence of capsular polysaccharide. whereas pspa is polymorphic, considerable cross-reactivity and cross-protection have been demonstrated among pspa proteins of pneumococci exhibiting different capsular and pspa serotypes. a  gene segment encoding the nonrepetitive variable nh2-terminal portion of pspa has been cloned into three distinct recombinant bacille calmette-guerin (rbcg) vectors, allowing for expression of pspa as a cytoplasmic or secreted protein, or a chimeric exported membrane-associated lipoprotein. all rbcg-pspa strains elicited comparable anti-pspa elisa titers, ranging from 10(4) to 10(5) (reciprocal titers) in both balb/c and c3h/hej mice. however, protective responses were observed only in animals immunized with the rbcg-pspa vaccines expressing pspa as a secreted protein or chimeric exported lipoprotein. in addition, anti-pspa immune sera elicited by the rbcg vaccines passively protected x-linked immunodeficient mice from lethal challenge with the highly virulent, encapsulated wu2 strain of streptococcus pneumoniae and two additional virulent strains exhibiting heterologous pspa and capsular serotypes. these studies confirm previous pspa immunization studies showing cross-protection against heterologous serotypes of s. pneumoniae and demonstrate a potential for rbcg-based pspa vaccines to elicit protective humoral responses against pneumococcal disease in humans.

AB  == concentrations of ceftriaxone in serum and intervertebral disc tissue were determined with high-pressure liquid chromatography in forty-five patients after  a single intravenous loading dose of 1000 milligrams given at different intervals before an operation on the spine. the mean serum concentrations in this study corresponded well with reported values. the mean tissue concentrations were 5.6 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 3.6 to 6.8 micrograms per gram) one to less than two hours after administration of the antibiotic, 6.4 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 2.8 to 10.0 micrograms per  gram) two to less than four hours, and 3.6 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 0.6 to 6.6 micrograms per gram) at fourteen to less than sixteen hours. these drug concentrations exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration that was effective against 90 per cent of the bacteria for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus; for streptococcus pyogenes, agalactiae, viridans, pneumoniae, and bovis; and for community-acquired enterobacteriaceae. the average serum-to-tissue ratio was 191:1 at less than one-half hour and 13:1 at less than one and a half hours. the lower values of the 95 per cent confidence intervals for the concentration of the antibiotic exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentrations in the disc tissue against most susceptible bacteria during the period between one and a half and four hours, but a larger bolus would be needed to maintain this level for a longer period (such as in a longer operation) and as prophylaxis against methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci.

TI  == protective immunity elicited by rbcg vaccines.
AB  == the live attenuated mycobacterium bovis strain bacille calmette-guerin (bcg) is still widely used as a vaccine against tuberculosis and therefore offers potential advantages as a safe, live vaccine vehicle for the expression and delivery of protective recombinant antigens. as an attenuated intracellular bacterium residing in macrophages, bcg would seem to be particularly suited for eliciting cellular responses and not humoral responses. efforts to improve the potential for recombinant bcg (rbcg) vaccines to elicit protective humoral responses were undertaken by developing vectors systems which export or secrete foreign antigens. expression of the ospa antigen of borrelia burgdorferi, as a chimaeric membrane-associated lipoprotein, resulted in high-titred protective humoral responses when compared to cytoplasmic or secreted expression of ospa. expression of the pspa antigen of streptococcus pneumoniae as a secreted or membrane-associated lipoprotein by rbcg did not result in higher-titred humoral responses in comparison to pspa expressed cytoplasmically but apparently improved the quality of protective pspa specific antibodies. based on these pre-clinical studies, rbcg vaccines for lyme and pneumococcal diseases are being developed for clinical trials in humans. the potential for eliciting mucosal responses to antigens delivered by rbcg was also investigated. nasal immunization was superior at eliciting substantial lasting mucosal responses at multiple mucosal sites and  also resulted in systemic responses comparable to those obtained with parenteral  immunization.

TI  == the antimicrobial activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefpirome, a new fourth-generation cephalosporin in comparison with other agents.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cefpirome was compared with amoxycillin/clavulanic  acid, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin and amikacin against 743 non-duplicate clinical isolates. mic50 and mic90 showed that the antibiotic was active against both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. cefpirome was highly active against most of the enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive proteus spp., aeromonas spp. (mic < or = 1 mg/l) and salmonella spp. (mic < or = 0.5 mg/l). neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producers) were all susceptible, with mic less than 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l respectively. cefpirome was more active than cefuroxime and ceftazidime against campylobacter spp. (mic < or = 2 mg/l), but less active than  ceftazidime against pseudomonas aeruginosa. cefpirome was active against streptococcus pneumoniae. streptococcus bovis and coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic < or = 0.5 mg/l) and methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mic < or = 2 mg/l). methicillin-resistant s. aureus, gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes were resistant to cefpirome. the stability of cefpirome to tem-1, tem-2, pse-1, shv-1 and the chromosomal-mediated p99 and k-1 beta-lactamases was comparable to ceftazidime.

AB  == microflora of the pouch epithelium of 17 female koalas (phascolarctos cinereus) were examined in relation to their current reproductive status and recent reproductive history. no microbial growth was observed in pouch swabs from 13 of  17 (76%) koalas, including four females without young, seven with pouch young and two with back young (i.e. permanently emerged from the pouch). growth of bacteria or yeasts was observed in pouch swabs from four koalas, each of which had experienced mortality of its pouch young during the current breeding season. seven species of microorganisms were isolated, including pseudomonas aeruginosa,  serratia marcescens and enterococcus faecalis. based on the absence of microflora in the majority of females examined, we propose that the pouch epithelium normally provides a hostile environment for microbial colonization.

TI  == rapid identification of streptococcus bovis by using combination constitutive enzyme substrate hydrolyses.
AB  == several studies have documented the association of blood and rectal-culture positivity for streptococcus bovis with gastrointestinal neoplasia, especially colonic carcinoma. conventional methods using bile-esculin hydrolysis, salt tolerance, and sugar fermentations to differentiate s. bovis from other streptococci are laborious, slow, and relatively expensive. commercially available systems are costly and require at least 24 to 48 h of incubation. a rapid identification procedure for s. bovis and related bacteria was developed. the method uses a reagent containing two hydrolyzable substrates, p-nitrophenyl-alpha-d-galactopyranoside and 4-methylumbilliferyl-beta-d-glucoside, in the presence of 2.5% sodium deoxycholate. this combination test, performed with a rapid assay for l-pyrrolidonyl-aminopeptidase, could distinguish s. bovis, streptococcus equinus, enterococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, and the viridans group streptococci  in culture within 30 min. twelve species of the genera streptococcus and enterococcus were tested. the rapid method correlated well with conventional techniques. the reagents are readily available, inexpensive, and easy to make and can be stored in the refrigerator for at least 6 months.

TI  == dna probe for identification of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == a total of 287 clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) were  tested for their ability to undergo autolysis when treated with sodium deoxycholate. the test was positive for all but one isolate, strain doc-1. this autolysis required the activity of an enzyme which is unique and characteristic of s. pneumoniae: a choline-dependent n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, the gene product of the lyta gene. we used lyta as a dna probe to test the distribution of the autolysin gene among clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae. in dot blot hybridization experiments our probe reacted with the dna of 60 of 60 strains tested, including the autolysis-deficient clinical isolate doc-1. no hybridization occurred when strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus bovis were tested. the lyta gene appears to be an ideal candidate for use as a dna probe for the identification of s. pneumoniae.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of bmy-28100 was tested against approximately 7,000 bacterial pathogens in a multicenter, multiphased collaborative investigation. the bmy-28100 spectrum and antimicrobial potency was most similar to that of cefaclor and superior to that of cephalexin among currently available cephalosporins. species that had greater than or equal to 90% of clinical strains inhibited by bmy-28100 (less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml) were: citrobacter diversus, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp., branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus supp., streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, serogroup c and g streptococci, listeria monocytogenes and gm-positive anaerobes. bmy-28100 inhibited 9% more of the 6286 fresh clinical isolates at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml than cefaclor at the same concentration. bmy-28100 was generally bactericidal, but mics for some species were markedly increased when an inoculum concentration of 10(7) cfu/ml was used. strains producing plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (tem, oxa, shv, hms) were susceptible to bmy-28100, cefaclor, and cefuroxime. bmy-28100 was less active against strains producing chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases (types i and iv). bmy-28100 was not hydrolyzed significantly by the tested plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but  was destroyed by type i cephalosporinases and klebsiella k1 enzymes.

TI  == molecular genetics of resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin b  (mls) in streptococci.
AB  == resistance to macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin b (mls phenotype) appears in  almost all streptococcal species isolated from man. genes coding for mls resistance are located on plasmids and one mls resistance transposon has been described. mls resistance genes have also been found in a large number of plasmid-free strains. plasmids of 17 to 20 megadaltons (mdal) that code either for mls or for both mls and chloramphenicol resistance are found in streptococci  of groups a, b, c, d (streptococcus faecalis) and g. these plasmids have broad host ranges (conjugative intraspecies, interspecies and intergeneric transfer), display similar restriction enzyme patterns and share a considerable degree of homology (78 to 95%). one smaller non-conjugative mls resistance plasmid has been isolated from str. sanguis (4.5 mdal). in group d (str. faecalis, str. faecium) streptococci, mls resistance genes are also found on plasmids that carry other antibiotic resistance (tetracycline, chloramphenicol, high-levels of streptomycin and kanamycin). these multi-resistance plasmids are either conjugative or non-conjugative and are of various sizes and molecular species and those that have been tested have narrow host-ranges. the mls resistance genes of one multi-resistant plasmid, isolated from a strain of str. faecalis, are located on  a transposon of 3.3 mdal, tn917. hybridization studies, with mls determinants as  probes, reveal homologies among various plasmid-borne mls resistance sequences. elements that are thought to be chromosome-borne mediate multiple antibiotic resistance (including mls) in streptococci of groups a, b, c, d (str. bovis), f,  g, str. pneumoniae, str. mitis, str. sanguis and str. milleri. strains harbouring such elements contain no detectable plasmid dna. in some of the strains these elements are conjugative; their resistance markers transfer en bloc at low frequency and display narrow host ranges. such elements, from str. pyogenes and str. agalactiae, were found to translocate onto various streptococcal haemolysin-bacteriocin plasmids.

AB  == in recent years several groups have used serological methods to demonstrate pneumococcal capsular antigens in sputum. in the present study 123 strains of alpha-hemolytic streptococci (including 97 strains from sputum or pharyngeal specimens) were tested for cross-reactions with a polyvalent antipneumococcal serum (omniserum). representatives of the following species were included: streptococcus bovis, s. equinus, s. intermedius, s. lactis, s. milleri, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. suis, and aerococcus viridans. serological reactions were detected by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination. fifteen (12%) of the strains  gave positive reactions by all three methods. positive reactions were also observed with another 32 strains (26%) with two of the methods, whereas 37 strains (30%) gave positive reactions by just one technique. altogether 84 (68%)  strains gave positive reactions with one or more of the methods. latex agglutination gave positive reactions with 26 (21%) strains compared with 57 (46%) in immunofluorescence and 63 (51%) in immunoelectroosmophoresis. absorption of the antiserum with one alpha-hemolytic strain reduced but did not entirely eliminate the cross-reactions with five tested strains. these findings indicate a potential risk of cross-reactions with polyvalent antipneumococcal serum in tests carried out on sputa or other specimens which may be contaminated with alpha-hemolytic streptococci.

TI  == clinical evaluation of a fluorescent antibody test for the serological diagnosis  of streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  == serum fluorescent streptococcal antibody tests were carried out on 71 patients with clinically suspected infective endocarditis, and a final diagnosis of endocarditis was obtained in 46 patients. a serological diagnosis of streptococcal endocarditis was obtained in 10 patients who had persistently negative blood cultures, as fluorescent streptococcal antibody titres equal to or greater than 400 were detected against at least one of four strains of streptococci used as heterologous antigens. there were no false positive fluorescent antibody results with heterologous antigens during tests on 29 patients who had either non-streptococcal endocarditis, a final diagnosis other than endocarditis, or streptococcal sepsis not associated with endocarditis. a negative result with the heterologous antibody test could not, however, exclude a diagnosis of streptococcal endocarditis as six of 11 patients with endocarditis due to streptococcus viridans or str bovis confirmed on blood culture had serum fluorescent antibody titres less than 400 against all the heterologous streptococcal antigens tested. homologous fluorescent streptococcal antibody titres equal to or greater than 400, using the patient's own blood culture isolate as the antigen, were found in the serum samples of 14 of 15 patients with endocarditis caused by viridans streptococci, three patients with enterococcal endocarditis, two patients with endocarditis caused by str pneumoniae, and one patient with str bovis endocarditis. in contrast, all five patients who had clinically insignificant streptococcal bacteraemias had serum fluorescent homologous antibody titres of only 100 or less. these results showed that the homologous serum fluorescent streptococcal antibody test could help to decide the clinical importance of a streptococcus which is initially isolated from only one  or two of a number of inoculated blood culture bottles.

TI  == mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  == vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. it also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. there is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits  ribonucleic acid synthesis. induction of bacterial l-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. stable l-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to  vancomycin. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant  strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), str. pyogenes, str. agalactiae, str. bovis, str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species and lactobacillus species. there has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against staph. aureus, str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. the combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of staph. epidermidis. it shows indifference against enterococci. vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against staph. aureus.

AB  == the serostat latex agglutination test (scott laboratories, inc., fiskesville, r.i.) for identification of group d streptococci was compared with bile-esculin agar and lancefield grouping by using 110 clinical isolates of group d streptococci (s. faecalis, 74; s. bovis, 24; s. durans, 3; s. faecium, 9) and 65  viridans streptococci (s. anginosus-constellatus, 2; streptococcus mg, 15; s. sanguis ii, 14; s. mitis, 7; s. mutans, 5; s. salivarius, 8; s. sanguis i, 8; s.  acidominimus, 1; s. morbillorum, 2; s. pneumoniae, 3). all strains of group d streptococci were bile-esculin positive. serostat reactions were falsely positive with 2 strains of s. sanguisii and 1 strain of streptococcus mg (4.6% of all viridans streptococci tested) and falsely negative with 10 s. bovis, 8 s. faecalis, 1 s. durans, and 6 s. faecium strains (22.7% of all group d streptococci tested). when considered with colonial morphology and hemolytic reaction, serostat is a rapid (60-s) and useful test for recognition of group d streptococci.

TI  == intramammary infections in primigravid heifers near parturition.
AB  == mammary secretion from 32 primigravid heifers was obtained aseptically to determine frequency of bacterial isolation and incidence of intramammary infection near parturition. quarter samples were collected 14 and 7 days prior to expected parturition, at parturition, and 7 and 14 days postparturition. analysis of culture data indicated that 77.1% of samples were bacteriologically negative,  and 15.7% contained coagulase negative staphylococci, 4.4% streptococci other than streptococcus agalactiae, 3.8% coliforms, .8% coagulase positive staphylococci, and .1% corynebacterium bovis. frequency of bacterial isolation was highest in samples obtained prior to and at parturition. thirty-five of 128 quarters were infected at parturition. twenty-six of the 35 infections were caused by coagulase negative staphylococci, 4 by streptococci other than streptococcus agalactiae, 4 by coliforms, and 1 by coagulase positive staphylococci. twenty infections were observed during the early postpartum period. coagulase negative staphylococcal infections decreased markedly. however, the number and type of primary pathogen infections during early lactation were similar to those at parturition.

TI  == susceptibility of bovine mammary gland to infections during the dry period.
AB  == quarter foremilk samples (1,574) were collected for bacteriological analysis from 40 cows during late lactation, early involution, prior to parturition, parturition, and during early lactation. six of 160 quarters were infected with major pathogens during late lactation. twelve new infections occurred during early involution. twenty-two quarters were infected at parturition. of these infections, 12 occurred after early involution, and 10 infections that originated during early involution persisted throughout the dry period. during early lactation, 21 major pathogen infections were observed. nine occurred after calving, and 12 persisted from parturition. most major pathogen infections (93.8%) were caused by coliforms and streptococcal species other than streptococcus agalactiae. numbers of streptococcal infections were highest at parturition and early lactation. numbers of quarters infected with coliforms were similar during early involution, parturition, and early lactation. coagulase negative staphylococcal infections increased during the dry period, whereas corynebacterium bovis infected quarters decreased. udder infections were few in cows completing first or second dry periods. the incidence of udder infection was highest in cows completing third or later dry periods.

TI  == cephapirin therapy in infective endocarditis.
AB  == ten patients, eight of them heroin addicts, with infective endocarditis were treated with cephapirin. causative organisms included staphylococcus aureus in six patients and viridans streptococci, s bovis, and s pneumoniae in one patient  each. in one of the patients with endocarditis, both s aureus and an organism of  the beta-streptococcus group were simultaneously isolated. all patients except two, both with monomicrobial s aureus endocarditis, were cured. all isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml of cephapirin. peak serum bactericidal activity greater than or equal to 32 times the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of the causative organism was achieved in all cases after giving 2 gm iv every four hours. after using large inoculums of staphylococci for in vitro tests, we found that twofold to eightfold increases in mic occurred. cephapirin was well tolerated intravenously and high levels in serum were achieved without toxicity or accumulation of the drug.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of streptococcus.
AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. the major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (s. faecalis, s. faecium, 's. avium' and a proposed new species 's. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (s. bovis, s. equinus, s. salivarius, 's. casseliflavus', s. mutans, s. raffinolactis and an unidentified oral group i); (c) lactic species group (s. lactis including s. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (s. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (s. mitis, s. sanguis, a proposed new species 's. oralis' and 's. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. equi, 's. equisimilis' including 's. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of lancefield group b strains of human origin);  (g) parapyogenic species group (s. uberis, 's. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of lancefield groups r, s and t). species of aerococcus, gemella, leuconostoc and pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.

TI  == detection and partial characterization of antibacterial factor(s) in alveolar lining material of rats.
AB  == intracellular killing of staphylococcus aureus by alveolar macrophages is known to be enhanced by exposure to alveolar lining material. because this material may have a role in pulmonary host defenses, we have studied its effect on pneumococci and other nonstaphylococcal organisms. alveolar lining material from rats caused  rapid killing and lysis of pneumococci. the antipneumococcal activity was localized to the surfactant-containing fraction of the fluid and was not affected by trypsin. phospholipid extracts of the surfactant fraction or purified lamellar bodies killed pneumococci. lysis of pneumococci by the surfactant fraction appeared to be mediated by a detergent-like activation of pneumococcal autolysin, in that bacteriolysis was prevented by substitution of ethanolamine for choline in pneumococcal cell walls, and a pneumococcal transformant that lacked autolysin was not lysed. the surfactant fraction readily killed pneumococci containing ethanolamine or the autolysin-defective transformant, and studies with tritiated  methyl-d-glucose loading and release showed that killing was associated with increased bacterial cell membrane permeability. bactericidal activity (without lysis) was observed with several nonpneumococcal gram-positive bacteria, including streptococcus viridans, unspeciated respiratory streptococci, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus bovis, and bacillus species. purified diacylphospholipids had no antibacterial activity, however, a lysophospholipid, palmitoyl lysophosphatidylcholine, had many properties resembling the surfactant-containing fraction of lavage, including autolysin-mediated pneumococcal lysis, altered cell membrane permeability, and antibacterial activity against several gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == anaerobic radiometric detection of facultative gram-positive cocci in blood.
AB  == radiometric detection of facultative gram-positive cocci, particularly streptococci, has been reported to be suboptimal. a recently marketed anaerobic bactec bottle (7c) with purportedly improved capability to detect facultative gram-positive cocci in blood was compared with the previously available bottle in a study of simulated bacteremia. the bactec system detected all beta-hemolytic streptococci and enterococci tested. detection of alpha-hemolytic streptococci was improved in general. however, detection of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus bovis and streptococcus pneumoniae remained suboptimal under anaerobic conditions. a metabolic index unit threshold for positivity of 15 is recommended when employing the anaerobic bactec bottle.

TI  == direct testing of blood cultures for detection of streptococcal antigens.
AB  == a direct, rapid, and simple method for the detection of streptococcal antigens of lancefield groups a, b, c, d, and g from blood cultures was developed by using a  coagglutination test. fifty-five clinical specimens and 117 simulated blood cultures containing gram-positive cocci were tested. out of 6,261 clinical blood  cultures screened, 55 cultures from 53 patients were positive, with organisms resembling streptococci, by gram stain. of these cultures, 78% (43 of 55) were pure cultures of streptococci, and 22% (12 of 55) were mixed with at least one other organism. of the 43 pure cultures only, correct reactions were obtained (grouping correctly or giving no cross-reactions, or both) with 86% (37 of 43) of the isolates, 12% (5 of 43) exhibited cross-reactions, and 2% (1 of 43) gave false-negative reactions. all of the cross-reacting isolates were streptococcus pneumoniae, which reacted with the group c reagent, and the false-negative reaction occurred with a streptococcus bovis isolate. however, by using a direct  modified bile solubility test, the correct identification of the s. pneumoniae isolates was obtained. therefore, by using the modified bile solubility test in conjunction with the direct grouping method, 98% (42 of 43) of the isolates in pure culture could be identified accurately and rapidly after the detection of a  positive gram stain. correct grouping reactions were obtained with 83% (10 of 12) of the mixed blood cultures, and false-negative results occurred with 17% (2 of 12) of them. both cultures contained an enterococcus and a gram-negative rod. of  the 117 simulated blood cultures, there was only one incorrect grouping reaction; this occurred with an s. bovis isolate that cross-reacted with the group c reagent. the direct grouping reaction was positive when blood cultures contained  a minimum of 1 x 10(8) to 8 x 10(8) colony-forming units per ml. in general, this procedure provided information on the identification of the organism 24 h earlier than by conventional identification methods.

TI  == [antibiotic resistance genetic basis of human origin streptococci (author's transl)].
AB  == one hundred strains of group a, b, c, d (s faecalis, s. faecium, s. bovis) f, g,  s. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci were studied. all these strains were clinical isolates from infective endocarditis and fron upper respiratory, skin, genital and urinary tract infections. these stains were resistant to one or several antibiotics : tetracycline, macrolide and related drugs, chloramphenicol, aminoglycosides (high-level resistance to streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin), and penicillin. conjugative transfer of antibiotic resistance markers (except penicillin) into streptococcal recipients was obtained at a high frequency (10(-1) to 10(-4)) for 12 strains and at a low frequency (10(-5) to 10(-8)) for 29 strains. r plasmids carrying various groups of resistance markers were isolated with different molecular weights. enzyme restriction analysis showed the existence of different molecular species of streptococcal plasmids. all attempts  to detect extrachromosomal dna in 17 wild-type strains and in the corresponding transconjugants were unsuccessful.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.

TI  == the antibacterial action of vancomycin.
AB  == vancomycin inhibits the second stage of cell wall synthesis in susceptible bacteria. furthermore, there is evidence that vancomycin also alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits ribonucleic acid synthesis. stable l-phase variants are susceptible to vancomycin, but induction of bacterial l-phase variants with vancomycin is very difficult. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive cocci and bacilli, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (including multiply resistant strains). streptococcus  pneumoniae (including multiply resistant strains), streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus bovis, viridans group streptococcus, enterococcus, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species, and lactobacillus species. antimicrobial activity can be enhanced with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against s. aureus, s. bovis, enterococcus, and viridans streptococcus. the combination of vancomycin and rifampin also has enhanced activity against s. aureus.

TI  == tumor-immunotherapeutic efficacy of serratia marcescens polyribosomes.
AB  == the ability of polyribosomes, obtained from several bacterial species, to suppress the development of cutaneous sad2 fibrosarcomas in dba/2 mice were evaluated. suppression of tumor appearance depended upon the tumor load at the time of treatment, dose of polyribosomes, and species source of polyribosomes, with serratia marcescens being superior to escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumoniae, mycobacterium bovis (pasteur), mycobacterium smegmatis, and propionibacterium acnes (formerly corynebacterium parvum). a single injection of  5 or 50 microgram of serratia polyribosomes at the tumor site 72 hr after the intradermal administration of 1.5 x 10(3) sad2 cells resulted in 66 to 95% survival. all untreated animals expired within 50 days. tumor suppression occurred at both flank and footpad sites. presensitization with polyribosomes and incorporation of polyribosomes into adjuvant were not required for the tumor-suppressive effect. treatment of serratia polyribosomes with rnase or pronase reduced the number of survivors. endotoxin was not detectable with the limulus amebocyte lysate assay.

TI  == meningitis caused by streptococcus in adults.
AB  == meningitis caused by streptococcus is uncommon in adults. otitis media, mastoiditis, sinusitis, or trauma has antedated most cases reported in the past.  data on 10 recent cases suggest changes in the current pathogenesis of streptococcal meningitis in adults and emphasize the importance of accurate streptococcal speciation. endocarditis was present in five cases; trauma played a role in two others. brain abscess, corticosteroids, alcoholic cirrhosis, and peritonitis secondary to chronic peritoneal dialysis were etiologic factors in five patients. otitis media, mastoiditis, and sinusitis were conspicuously absent. streptococcus agalctiae accounted for purulent meningitis in two postmenopausal women. both strains of group b streptococcus were bacitracin-sensitive and were thus mislabeled group a. recognition of streptococcus bovis spared two patients unnecessary aminoglycoside adminstration. nine of the 10 patients survived, including a women with prosthetic mitral valve  endocarditis and a man with a ruptured brain abscess. differentiation of these streptococci from streptococcus pneumoniae was seldon possible on the basis of the spinal fluid gram stain alone.
