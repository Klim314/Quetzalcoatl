TI  == antimicrobial activity of preparation bioaron c.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of sirupus bioaron c, a preparation, whose main ingredient is an extract from the leaves of aloe arborescens, was tested against  different microorganisms isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections. the experiments were performed on 40 strains: 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria, 13 strains of aerobic bacteria and 7 strains of yeast-like fungi from the genus candida and on 18 reference strains (atcc). the antimicrobial activity  of bioaron c (mbc and mfc) was determined at undiluted concentration. bioaron c proved to be very effective against the microorganisms causing infections. at the concentration recommended by the producer, the preparation showed biocidal activity (mbc, mfc) against the strains of the pathogenic microorganisms, which cause respiratory infections most frequently, including, among others, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, parvimonas micra, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus anginosus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans, already after 15 min. the mic of bioaron c against most of the tested microorganisms was 5 to 100 times lower than the usually applied concentration. the great antimicrobial activity means that the preparation may be used in the prevention and treatment of infections of the upper respiratory tract. bioaron c  may be an alternative or complement to classical therapy, especially in children.

TI  == [microbiocenosis of stomach in children with chronic gastritis].
AB  == qualitative and quantitative composition of gastric microflora has been studied in 30 children with chronic gastritis. bacteriological study of gastric biopsies  and parietal mucus in 10 children with chronic gastritis not associated with helicobacter pylori more frequently revealed conditionally pathogenic bacteria--escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus viridans, s. pyogenes (group a), peptostreptococcus anaerobius, p. prevotii and their associations. in 20 studied patients with h.pylori-associated chronic gastritis composition of local microflora was less diverse--conditionally pathogenic, lacto- and bifidobacteria often were absent. study showed that eradication of h.  pylori led to appearance of conditionally pathogenic bacteria in stomach microflora, which were frequently isolated in associations. not effective treatment was associated with disappearance of lacto- and bifidobacteria and frequent isolation of candida albicans.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and  penicillins. fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa; n = 127), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa; n = 123), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), enterococcus faecium (n = 50), enterococcus avium (n = 50), and peptostreptococcus spp. (p. anaerobius, p. asaccharolyticus, p. magnus, p. micros, p. prevotii; n = 125). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also  observed with ceftazidime (caz), cpr, cfpm, fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. the decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual mic range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.

TI  == microorganisms associated with abscesses of sheep and goats in the south of iran.
AB  == a total of 86 abscesses (45 and 41) abscesses of sheep and goats, respectively) were examined for their causal agents; 44 of these abscesses were located subcutaneously, and the remaining 42 were in lungs, livers, intestines, and udders. a total of 23 different types of microorganisms were isolated from 78 abscesses; bacteria were not detected in the remaining eight abscesses. microorganisms isolated were: species of the genera corynebacterium, staphylococcus, and streptococcus and pasteurella, escherichia coli, and other gram-negative rods. peptostreptococcus anaerobius and eubacterium tortuosum were  isolated in pure culture from one abscess each in goats. two to four different microorganisms were associated with 25 of the 86 abscesses. it was determined that 11 isolates of corynebacterium pyogenes, 2 isolates of pasteurella haemolytica, 1 of p multocida, and 1 of c pseudotuberculosis were lethal to mice. two of the c pyogenes isolates from subcutaneous spreading abscesses of goats were pathogenic for rabbits; these two isolates produced similar suppurative inflammation in goats experimentally, but did not cause death. as determined by experimental inoculation, goats were more susceptible than sheep to the two isolates. in nature, subcutaneous abscesses of goats associated with c pyogenes were of a more diffusive type which resulted in generalization of the infection and death of the animals. postmortem examination of ten goats dying of field infection showed the presence of larvae of the warble-fly przhevalskiana silenus  at the site of infection.

TI  == survival of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria on cotton swabs in three transport systems.
AB  == the capacity of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to survive on cotton swabs placed  into a dry gassed-out co2-filled tube (dgt), dry sterile aerobic tube (dat), and  a tube containing a modified stuarts' transport medium (mst), was assessed. pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in numbers by 2 and 3 logs when stored in mst and dat, respectively. the viability of p. aeruginosa, although retarded when compared to msa and dat, was not adversely affected by the co2 environment in the dgt. the mst maintained relatively constant numbers of streptococcus pyogenes during the 48-h storage period. the dat and the dgt were unable to maintain the viability of s. pyogenes. staphylococcus aureus, when stored in a dgt, dat, or mst, was maintained in relatively constant numbers throughout the entire storage  period. of the four anaerobic bacteria evaluated (bacteroides fragilis ssp. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides melaninogenicus ssp. asaccharolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius), only b. fragilis ssp. thetaiotamicron survived the 48-h storage period in the dgt. under these test conditions the dgt did not adequately maintain the viability of the majority of anaerobic bacteria tested (when held on cotton swabs). however, the mst did maintain the viability of all species tested for at least the first 2 h of storage.
