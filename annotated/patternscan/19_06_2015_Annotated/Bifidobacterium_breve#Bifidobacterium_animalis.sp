TI  == evaluation of culture media for selective enumeration of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to test the suitability of transgalactosylated oligosaccharides-mupirocin lithium salt (tos-mup) and mrs-clindamycin-ciprofloxacin (mrs-cc) agars, along with several other culture media, for selectively enumerating bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria (lab)  species commonly used to make fermented milks. pure culture suspensions of a total of 13 dairy bacteria strains, belonging to eight species and five genera, were tested for growth capability under various incubation conditions. tos-mup agar was successfully used for the selective enumeration of both bifidobacterium  animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 and b. breve m-16 v. mrs-cc agar showed relatively good selectivity for lactobacillus acidophilus, however, it also promoted the growth of lb. casei strains. for this reason, mrs-cc agar can only be used as a selective medium for the enumeration of lb. acidophilus if lb. casei is not present in a product at levels similar to or exceeding those of lb. acidophilus.  unlike bifidobacteria and coccus-shaped lab, all the lactobacilli strains involved in this work were found to grow well in mrs ph 5.4 agar incubated under  anaerobiosis at 37 degrees c for 72 h. therefore, this method proved to be particularly suitable for the selective enumeration of lactobacillus spp.

TI  == bifidobacterium breve c50 secretes lipoprotein with chap domain recognized in aggregated form by tlr2.
AB  == extracellular components secreted by bifidobacterium breve c50 can induce maturation, high il-10 production and prolonged survival of dendritic cells via a tlr2 pathway. in this study, the components were isolated from the supernatant by gel filtration chromatography. antibodies raised against the major compounds with molecular weight above 600 kda (bb c50bc) also recognized compounds of lower molecular weight (200-600 kda). tlr2 and tlr6 bound to the components already recognized by the antibodies. trypsin digestion of bb c50bc released three major  peptides whose sequences displayed close similarities to a putative secreted protein with a chap amidase domain from b. breve. the 1300-bp genomic region corresponding to the hypothetical protein was amplified by pcr. the deduced polypeptide started with an n-terminal signal sequence of 45 amino acids, containing the lipobox motif (laac) with the cysteine in position 25, and 2 positively charged residues within the first 14 residues of the signal sequence.  lipid detection in bb c50bc by gc/ms further supported the implication of a lipoprotein. sugars were also detected in bb c50bc. close similarity with the glucan-binding protein b from bifidobacterium animalis of two released peptides from bb c50bc protein suggested that glucose moieties, possibly in glucan form, could be bound to the lipoprotein. finally, heating at 100 degrees c for 5 min led to the breakdown of bb c50bc in compounds of molecular weight below 67 kda, which suggested that bb c50bc was an aggregate. one might assume that a basic unit was formed by the lipoprotein bound putatively to glucan. besides the other  sugars and hexosamines recognized by galectin 1 were localized at the surface of  the bb c50bc aggregate. in conclusion, the extracellular components secreted by b. breve c50 were constituted of a lipoprotein putatively associated with glucose moieties and acting in an aggregating form as an agonist of tlr2/tlr6.

TI  == mupirocin-mucin agar for selective enumeration of bifidobacterium bifidum.
AB  == bifidobacterium bifidum is a bacterial species exclusively found in the human intestinal tract. this species is becoming increasingly popular as a probiotic organism added to lyophilized products. in this study, porcine mucin was used as  the sole carbon source for the selective enumeration of b. bifidum in probiotic food additives. thirty-six bifidobacterial strains were cultivated in broth with  mucin. only 13 strains of b. bifidum utilized the mucin to produce acids. b. bifidum was selectively enumerated in eight probiotic food supplements using agar (mm agar) containing mupirocin (100 mg/l) and mucin (20 g/l) as the sole carbon source. mm agar was fully selective if the b. bifidum species was presented together with bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, bifidobacterium breve, and  bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum species and with lactic acid bacteria (lactobacilli, streptococci). isolated strains of b. bifidum were identified using biochemical, pcr, maldi-tof procedures and 16s rrna gene sequencing. the novel selective medium was also suitable for the isolation of b. bifidum strains  from human fecal samples.

TI  == bile enhances cell surface hydrophobicity and biofilm formation of bifidobacteria.
AB  == twenty-four human bifidobacterial strains were analysed for cell surface hydrophobicity (csh) using a salt aggregation test (sat) and a congo red binding  (crb) assay. three strains were selected for a systematic study on the csh and biofilm formation: bifidobacterium breve 46, bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis 8:8 and a reference strain b. animalis ssp. lactis jcm 10602. crb of the b. breve 46 and b. animalis ssp. lactis jcm 10602 was significantly enhanced (p < 0.05) when grown in deman-rogosa-sharpe cysteine (mrsc) broth supplemented with taurocholic acid (ta) or native porcine bile (pb). an enhanced csh of the strains grown with pb and gastric mucin correlated with an increased mucin binding and an enhanced biofilm formation in prebiotic oligosaccharide-supplemented cultures. the three strains showed late bile-induced biofilm (72 h) under an anaerobic growth condition, and both b. animalis ssp. lactis strains showed a late bile-induced biofilm formation under aerobic conditions shown by crystal violet staining. these two strains were thus considered to be oxygen tolerant and more robust. furthermore, enhanced biofilm formation of these robust bifidobacterial strains in the presence of prebiotics may allow for strong colonisation in the gastrointestinal tract when administered to in vivo models as a "synbiotic supplement".

TI  == cholesterol-lowering probiotics: in vitro selection and in vivo testing of bifidobacteria.
AB  == thirty-four strains of bifidobacteria belonging to bifidobacterium adolescentis,  bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseu-docatenulatum were assayed in vitro for the ability to assimilate cholesterol and for bile salt hydrolase (bsh) against glycocholic and taurodeoxycholic acids (gca and tdca). cholesterol assimilation was peculiar characteristic of two strains belonging to the species  b. bifidum (b. bifidum mb 107 and b. bifidum mb 109), which removed 81 and 50 mg  of cholesterol per gram of biomass, being the median of specific cholesterol absorption by bifidobacteria 19 mg/g. significant differences in bsh activities were not established among bifidobacterial species. however, the screening resulted in the selection of promising strains able to efficiently deconjugate gca and tdca. no relationship was recognized between bsh phenotype and the extent of cholesterol assimilation. on the basis of cholesterol assimilation or bshgca and bshtdca activities, b. bifidum mb 109 (dsmz 23731), b. breve mb 113 (dsmz 23732), and b. animalis subsp. lactis mb 2409 (dsmz 23733) were combined in a probiotic mixture to be fed to hypercholesterolemic rats. the administration of this probiotic formulation resulted in a significant reduction of total cholesterol and low-density cholesterol (ldl-c), whereas it did not affect high-density cholesterol (hdl-c) and hdl-c/ldl-c ratio.

TI  == quantification of human fecal bifidobacterium species by use of quantitative real-time pcr analysis targeting the groel gene.
AB  == quantitative real-time pcr assays targeting the groel gene for the specific enumeration of 12 human fecal bifidobacterium species were developed. the housekeeping gene groel (hsp60 in eukaryotes) was used as a discriminative marker for the differentiation of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. animalis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. gallicum, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. pseudolongum, and b. thermophilum. the bifidobacterial chromosome contains a single copy of the groel gene, allowing the determination of the cell number by quantification of the groel copy number. real-time pcr assays were validated by comparing fecal samples spiked with known  numbers of a given bifidobacterium species. independent of the bifidobacterium species tested, the proportion of groel copies recovered from fecal samples spiked with 5 to 9 log(10) cells/g feces was approximately 50%. the quantification limit was 5 to 6 log(10) groel copies/g feces. the interassay variability was less than 10%, and variability between different dna extractions  was less than 23%. the method developed was applied to fecal samples from healthy adults and full-term breast-fed infants. bifidobacterial diversity in both adults and infants was low, with mostly </=3 bifidobacterium species and b. longum frequently detected. the predominant species in infant and adult fecal samples were b. breve and b. adolescentis, respectively. it was possible to distinguish b. catenulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum. we conclude that the groel gene is a suitable molecular marker for the specific and accurate quantification of human fecal bifidobacterium species by real-time pcr.

TI  == effects of administration of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis gcl2505 on defecation frequency and bifidobacterial microbiota composition in humans.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in endogenous bifidobacteria and administered bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (b. lactis) gcl2505 (gcl2505) in the intestine after administration of gcl2505 by means of a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind, cross-over study. an increase in the number of total bifidobacteria (the sum of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. longum subsp. longum, b. adolescentis, b. anglatum, b. catenulatum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. dentium, b. longum subsp. infantis and b. lactis) in the feces were observed after administration of gcl2505 using species- and subspecies-specific real-time  polymerase chain reaction analysis. however, the number of endogenous bifidobacteria species (excluding b. lactis) remained unchanged. b. lactis also became the predominant bifidobacterial species. taking into account the number of gcl2505 administered, the findings further suggested that gcl2505 proliferated in the intestine. in addition, the defecation frequency increased during gcl2505 administration compared with the placebo. moreover, a single administration study (n=17) clearly demonstrated that gcl2505 successfully reached the intestine before proliferating at least 10-fold. this is the first report to show an increase in intestinal bifidobacteria, with no changes to the endogenous species, and improvements in constipation following proliferation of administered bifidobacteria.

TI  == use of tuf gene-based primers for the pcr detection of probiotic bifidobacterium  species and enumeration of bifidobacteria in fermented milk by cultural and quantitative real-time pcr methods.
AB  == due to the increasing use of bifidobacteria in probiotic products, it is essential to establish a rapid method for the qualitative and quantitative assay  of the bifidobacteria in commercial products. in this study, partial sequences of the tuf gene for 18 bifidobacterium strains belonging to 14 species were determined. alignment of these sequences showed that the similarities among these bifidobacterium species were 82.24% to 99.72%. based on these tuf gene sequences, 6 primer sets were designed for the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay of b. animalis subsp. animalis, b. animalis subsp. lactis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. longum subsp. infantis, b. longum subsp. longum, and the genus of bifidobacterium, respectively. these bifidobacterium species are common probiotic species present in dairy and probiotic products. when each target bifidobacterium spp. was assayed with the designed primers, pcr product with expected size was generated. in addition, for each target species, more than 70 bacterial strains other than the target species, including strains of other bifidobacterium species, strains of lactobacillus spp., enterococcus spp., and other bacterial species, all generated negative results. pcr assay with primers specific to b. animalis subsp. lactis and b. longum subsp. longum confirmed the presence of these bifidobacterium species in commercial yogurt products. in addition, for each product, enumeration of the bifidobacteria cells by culture method with bim-25 agar and the quantitative real-time pcr showed similar cell counts. such results indicated that within 15-d storage (4 degrees c) after manufacture, all the bifidobacteria cells originally present in yogurt products were viable and culturable during the storage.

TI  == the use of probiotics in healthy volunteers with evacuation disorders and hard stools: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
AB  == background: evacuation disorders and hard stools are common in industrialized countries, affecting on average 12% to 17% of the adult healthy population at any age. dietary supplementation with probiotic microorganisms may be useful in reducing the disorder. methods: we performed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effectiveness of 2 different probiotic blends, either mixed lactobacillus plantarum lp01 (lmg p-21021) and bifidobacterium breve br03 (dsm 16604) or bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis bs01 (lmg p-21384), in the management of evacuation disorders and intestinal discomfort. in a period of 5 years (2003 to 2008), the study involved  300 healthy volunteers (151 males and 149 females; age 24 to 71 y) with evacuation disorders and hard stools. in particular, subjects were divided into 3 groups: 80 subjects in the group a received placebo, 110 subjects in the group b  received mixed l. plantarum lp01 and b. breve br03 (2.5 x 10 colony-forming units/d of each strain), and 110 subjects in the group c received b. animalis subsp. lactis bs01 (5 x 10 colony-forming units/d) for 30 days. at the beginning  of the observational study, the healthy status of volunteers was evaluated by a complete, laboratory and ultrasound study of the abdomen. the physical examination was repeated after 15 and 30 days. in particular, the main troubles typically associated with evacuation disorders and hard stools as well as abdominal bloating were considered as parameters of interest. exclusion criteria  were items of gastrointestinal diseases and antibiotics intake. results: subjects treated with the mixed probiotic strains l. plantarum lp01 and b. breve br03 or b. animalis subsp. lactis bs01 reported a significant improvement in the number of weekly bowel movements and in the main troubles associated with evacuations, particularly consistency of feces and ease of expulsion. discomfort items such as abdominal bloating and anal itching, burning, or pain also registered a relevant  improvement in the active groups receiving probiotics. conclusions: the intake of an effective amount of mixed l. plantarum lp01 and b. breve br03 or b. animalis subsp. lactis bs01 for 30 days is able to significantly relieve the evacuation disorders and hard stools, thus providing a useful tool for the management of such condition, which is particularly widespread in industrialized countries at any age.

TI  == distinct bifidobacterium strains drive different immune responses in vitro.
AB  == in this work we evaluated the specific immune activation properties of different  bifidobacterium strains, some of the most relevant intestinal microorganisms. to  this end, we examined the in vitro effect of 12 bifidobacterium strains belonging to 4 different species, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, on the maturation pattern of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (dcs), as well as in their ability to induce cytokine secretion. in addition, we determined peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) proliferation and cytokine expression after exposure to bacterial strains. all bifidobacteria tested were able to induce full dc maturation but showed differences in the levels of cytokine production, especially il-12, il-10, tnfalpha and il-1beta, suggesting that specific cytokine ratios could be used to predict the type of th response that they may promote. in fact, analysis of cytokine production by pbmc showed that most of the tested b. animalis and b. longum strains induced the secretion of large amounts of ifngamma and tnfalpha, in agreement with the th1 profile suggested by dc cytokine production. remarkably, three of four b. bifidum strains induced poor secretion of these cytokines and significant amounts of il-17, the main product of th17 cells, in accordance with the high il-1beta/il-12 ratio observed after dc stimulation. in conclusion, this work shows species and strain-specific immune effects of bifidobacteria and describes a valuable method for screening possible  probiotic strains with different immunomodulatory properties. notably, some b. bifidum strains seem to promote th17 polarization, which could be useful for future probiotic applications.

TI  == species delineation and clonal diversity in four bifidobacterium species as revealed by multilocus sequencing.
AB  == the genus bifidobacterium comprises several species that are important contributors to the gut microbiome, with some strains having beneficial health effects. understanding the evolutionary emergence of advantageous biological properties requires knowledge of the genetic diversity and clonal structure of species. we sequenced seven housekeeping genes in 119 bifidobacterium strains of  bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve and bifidobacterium longum. phylogenetic analysis of concatenated sequences delineated sequence clusters that correspond to previously named taxa, and suggested that b. longum subsp. infantis is a nascent lineage emerging from within b. longum subsp. longum. clear traces of recombination among distant bifidobacterial species indicate leaky species borders and warn against the practice of single gene-based identification. multilocus sequence typing achieved precise strain genotyping, with discrimination indices above 99% in b. bifidum, b. breve and b. longum, providing a powerful tool for strain traceability, colonization dynamics and ecological studies. frequent homologous recombination accelerates clonal diversification and may facilitate the transfer of biological  properties among bifidobacterial strains.

TI  == distribution of in vitro fermentation ability of lacto-n-biose i, a major building block of human milk oligosaccharides, in bifidobacterial strains.
AB  == this study investigated the potential utilization of lacto-n-biose i (lnb) by individual strains of bifidobacteria. lnb is a building block for the human milk  oligosaccharides, which have been suggested to be a factor for selective growth of bifidobacteria. a total of 208 strains comprising 10 species and 4 subspecies  were analyzed for the presence of the galacto-n-biose/lacto-n-biose i phosphorylase (glnbp) gene (lnpa) and examined for growth when lnb was used as the sole carbohydrate source. while all strains of bifidobacterium longum subsp.  longum, b. longum subsp. infantis, b. breve, and b. bifidum were able to grow on  lnb, none of the strains of b. adolescentis, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. angulatum, b. animalis subsp. lactis, and b. thermophilum showed any growth. in addition, some strains of b. pseudocatenulatum, b. animalis subsp. animalis, and  b. pseudolongum exhibited the ability to utilize lnb. with the exception for b. pseudocatenulatum, the presence of lnpa coincided with lnb utilization in almost  all strains. these results indicate that bifidobacterial species, which are the predominant species found in infant intestines, are potential utilizers of lnb. these findings support the hypothesis that glnbp plays a key role in the colonization of bifidobacteria in the infant intestine.

TI  == oral treatment with probiotics reduces allergic symptoms in ovalbumin-sensitized  mice: a bacterial strain comparative study.
AB  == background/aim: evidence demonstrating an important role of the intestinal microbiota in the incidence of allergic disorders has led to the concept of using probiotics as possible antiallergic therapy. this study aimed to select a bacterial strain with the best antiallergic treatment effects from a panel of 6 bacterial strains in a mouse model of ovalbumin(ova)-allergic asthma. methods: ova-sensitized balb/c mice were orally administered the bacterial strains bifidobacterium breve m-16v, b. infantis numres251, b. animalis numres252 and numres253, lactobacillus plantarum numres8 and l. rhamnosus numres6. after challenge by ova inhalation in the lungs, the response to methacholine was measured. pulmonary inflammation was assessed by analyzing bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for the presence of eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes and for interleukin 4, interleukin 5, interleukin 10 and interferon-gamma. ova-specific ige, igg1 and igg2a were measured in serum. next, the effect on acute allergic skin reaction was measured after treatment with b. breve m-16v and l. plantarum numres8. results: of the panel of 6 strains, b. breve m-16v and l. plantarum numres8 inhibited (1) the response to methacholine, (2) reduced the number of eosinophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, (3) reduced both ova-specific ige and (4) ova-specific igg1, whereas the other strains did not affect all these parameters simultaneously. b. breve m-16v but not l. plantarum numres8 reduced interleukin 4, interleukin 5 and interleukin 10. furthermore, b.  breve m-16v but not l. plantarum numres8 reduced acute allergic skin reactions to ova. conclusion: b. breve m-16v was identified as the most potent antiallergic strain.

TI  == the effect of pomegranate (punica granatum l.) byproducts and ellagitannins on the growth of human gut bacteria.
AB  == the consumption of pomegranate products leads to a significant accumulation of ellagitannins in the large intestines, where they interact with complex gut microflora. this study investigated the effect of pomegranate tannin constituents on the growth of various species of human gut bacteria. our results showed that pomegranate byproducts and punicalagins inhibited the growth of pathogenic clostridia and staphyloccocus aureus. probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were generally not affected by ellagitannins, while relatively small growth inhibition by ellagic acid likely resulted from decreasing media quality due to the formation of tannin-protein complexes. the effect of pomegranate ellagitannins on bifidobacteria was species- and tannin-dependent. the growth of  bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis was slightly inhibited by punicalagins, punicalins, and ellagic acid. pomx supplementation significantly enhanced the growth of bifidobacterium breve and bifidobacterium infantis.

TI  == native wheat, potato and pea starches and their physically modified preparations  tested in vitro as the substrates for selected bifidobacterium strains.
AB  == the wheat, potato and pea starches subjected to physical modification were studied in vitro as a substrate for selected bifidobacterium strains (bifidobacterium breve kn14, bifidobacterium animalis ks20a1). the effects of these substrates on bifidobacterial growth, acidifying activity, metabolic end-products and changes in starch microstructure were assayed after 24-h fermentation. physically modified starch preparations were better utilized substrates for growth of bifidobacterium monocultures, in comparison with native  starches. lactic acid occurred in the highest concentration in the culture of b.  breve kn14 (55-104 micromol/100 ml), whereas acetic acid was highest in the culture of b. animalis ks20a1 (329-378 micromol/100 ml). the microstructure pictures showed meaningful differences between native and modified starches stemmed from the enzymatic action of examined bifidobacterium strains during fermentation. obtained results confirmed the stimulation of growth and acidifying activity of selected bifidobacterium strains by investigated physically modified  starches in comparison with native starch.

TI  == bile-inducible efflux transporter from bifidobacterium longum ncc2705, conferring bile resistance.
AB  == bifidobacteria are normal inhabitants of the human gut. some strains of this genus are considered health promoting or probiotic, being included in numerous food products. in order to exert their health benefits, these bacteria must overcome biological barriers, including bile salts, to colonize and survive in specific parts of the intestinal tract. the role of multidrug resistance (mdr) transporters in bile resistance of probiotic bacteria and the effect of bile on probiotic gene expression are not fully understood. in the present study, the effect of subinhibitory concentrations of bile on the expression levels of predicted mdr genes from three different bifidobacterial strains, belonging to bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium  animalis subsp. lactis, was tested. in this way, two putative mdr genes whose expression was induced by bile, bl0920 from b. longum and its homolog, bbr0838, from b. breve, were identified. the expression of the bl0920 gene in escherichia  coli was shown to confer resistance to bile, likely to be mediated by active efflux from the cells. to the best of our knowledge, this represents the first identified bifidobacterial bile efflux pump whose expression is induced by bile.

TI  == exploring the diversity of the bifidobacterial population in the human intestinal tract.
AB  == although the health-promoting roles of bifidobacteria are widely accepted, the diversity of bifidobacteria among the human intestinal microbiota is still poorly understood. we performed a census of bifidobacterial populations from human intestinal mucosal and fecal samples by plating them on selective medium, coupled with molecular analysis of selected rrna gene sequences (16s rrna gene and internally transcribed spacer [its] 16s-23s spacer sequences) of isolated colonies. a total of 900 isolates were collected, of which 704 were shown to belong to bifidobacteria. analyses showed that the culturable bifidobacterial population from intestinal and fecal samples include six main phylogenetic taxa,  i.e., bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, bifidobacterium  adolescentis, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium bifidum, and two species mostly detected in fecal samples, i.e.,  bifidobacterium dentium and bifidobacterium animalis subp. lactis. analysis of bifidobacterial distribution based on age of the subject revealed that certain identified bifidobacterial species were exclusively present in the adult human gut microbiota whereas others were found to be widely distributed. we encountered significant intersubject variability and composition differences between fecal and mucosa-adherent bifidobacterial communities. in contrast, a modest diversification of bifidobacterial populations was noticed between different intestinal regions within the same individual (intrasubject variability). notably, a small number of bifidobacterial isolates were shown to display a wide  ecological distribution, thus suggesting that they possess a broad colonization capacity.

TI  == detection of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (bb12) in the intestine after feeding of sows and their piglets.
AB  == a real-time pcr method has been developed to distinguish bifidobacterium animalis subspecies in the gastrointestinal tracts of pigs. identification of a highly conserved single-copy tuf gene encoding the elongation factor tu involved in bacterial protein biosynthesis was used as a marker to differentiate homologous bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (strain bb12) from bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis, as well as bifidobacterium suis, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, several species of lactobacillus, and enterococcus faecium. real-time pcr detection of serially diluted dna extracted from a pure culture of bb12 was linear for bacterial numbers ranging from 10 to 10,000 tuf gene copies per pcr (r(2) = 0.99). relative differences in bb12 bacterial numbers in pigs fed daily with bb12 were determined after detection of bb12 tuf gene copies in dna extracted from the intestinal contents. piglets treated with bb12 immediately after birth maintained a high level of bb12 in their large intestines with continuous daily administration of bb12. piglets born to bb12-treated sows during the last third of their gestation and also treated with bb12 at birth (t/t group) had a higher number of bb12 organisms per gram of intestinal contents compared to placebo-treated piglets born to placebo-treated sows (c/c group), bb12-treated sows (t/c group), or piglets born to placebo sows but treated with bb12 immediately after birth (c/t group). in addition, there was a significant increase in gene expression for toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9) in piglets from the t/t group, with no change in tlr2 and tlr4. these findings suggest that the tuf gene represents a specific and functional marker for detecting bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis strain bb12 within the microbiota of the intestine.

TI  == bifidobacterium microbiota and parameters of immune function in elderly subjects.
AB  == faecal and serum samples were collected over a period of 6 months from 55 institutionalized elderly subjects, who were enrolled in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. participants were randomized in one of the three treatment groups: intervention (two probiotic bifidobacterium longum strains: 2c  and 46), placebo and commercial control (bifidobacterium lactis bb-12). the faecal bifidobacterium microbiota was characterized by genus and species-specific pcr. serum levels of the cytokines il-10, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha and transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta1 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. each participant harboured on average approximately three different bifidobacterial species. the most frequently detected species were b. longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium bifidum. depending on the treatment, the intervention resulted in specific changes in the levels of certain bifidobacterium species, and positive correlations were found between the different species. negative correlations were observed between the levels of bifidobacterium species and the pro-inflammatory cytokine tnf-alpha and the regulatory cytokine il-10. the presence of faecal b. longum and bifidobacterium animalis correlated with reduced serum il-10. the anti-inflammatory tgf-beta1 levels were increased over time in all three groups, and the presence of bifidobacterium breve correlated with higher serum tgf-beta1 levels. this indicates that modulation of the faecal bifidobacterium microbiota may provide a  means of influencing inflammatory responses.

TI  == utilization of resistant starch of native tapioca, corn and waxy corn starches and their retrograded preparations by bifidobacterium.
AB  == anaerobic fermentation of native starches from tapioca, normal and waxy corn, and their laboratory modified preparations, by selected bifidobacterium strains (bifidobacterium pseudolongum ksi9, bifidobacterium breve kn14, and bifidobacterium animalis ks20a1) was carried out under in vitro conditions. the growth and acidifying properties of bifidobacteria and utilization of resistant starches were determined in relation to glucose in the control sample. the preparations obtained from normal and waxy corn starches were the best substrates for growth of b. breve kn14, even compared with glucose. the growth of b. animalis ks20a1 was comparable, both on native and modified starches, whereas the starch preparations better stimulated the growth and acidifying activity of b. pseudolongum ksi9, as compared with native starches. the resistant starch fractions of all preparations were generally utilized to a higher degree (64-85%) compared with native starches (56-79%). the results of the study indicate that tapioca and corn starches, both native and modified, could be substrates beneficial for the enhancement of bifidobacterium intestinal populations.

TI  == evaluation of the pcr method for identification of bifidobacterium species.
AB  == aims: bifidobacterium species are known for their beneficial effects on health and their wide use as probiotics. although various polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods for the identification of bifidobacterium species have been published, the reliability of these methods remains open to question. methods and results: in this study, we evaluated 37 previously reported pcr primer sets designed to amplify 16s rdna, 23s rdna, intergenic spacer regions, or repetitive  dna sequences of various bifidobacterium species. conclusions: ten of 37 experimental primer sets showed specificity for b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. breve, b. bifidum, b. longum, b. longum biovar infantis and b. dentium. significance and impact of the study: the results suggest that published bifidobacterium primer sets should be re-evaluated for both reproducibility and specificity for the identification of bifidobacterium species using pcr. improvement of existing pcr methods will be needed to facilitate identification of other bifidobacterium strains, such as b. animalis, b. catenulatum, b. thermophilum and b. subtile.

TI  == qualitative and quantitative analyses of the bifidobacterial microbiota in the colonic mucosa of patients with colorectal cancer, diverticulitis and inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  == aim: to characterize the bifidobacterial microbiota of the colonic mucosa in patients with colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease or diverticuitis. methods: a sample of the distal colonic mucosa was taken during surgery from a total of 34 patients, twenty-one with diagnosed colorectal cancer, nine with diverticulitis and four with inflammatory bowel disease, requiring surgery for their condition.  bacterial dna was extracted from the resected mucosal samples and bifidobacterial mucosa-associated microbiota was qualitatively and quantitatively determined by means of qualitative and quantitative pcr. results: bifidobacteria were found in  100% of the samples from patients with diverticulitis or ibd and a 76% of those suffering colon cancer. the species b. longum and b. bifidum were the most widely found, followed by b. animalis, b. catenulatum and b. adolescentis. b. breve, b.  dentium and b. angulatum were not detected in any sample. a significantly higher  occurrence of b. longum was observed in patients with diverticulitis than in those with colon cancer or ibd (100%, 62% and 75%, respectively, p < 0.05). similar results were obtained for b. animalis (56%, 0% and 25%, p < 0.05), while  b. adolescentis was only found in the mucosa from patients with colon cancer (5 out of 21, 24%). at the quantitative level, patients with colon cancer or ibd showed lower counts of total bifidobacterium (4.94 and 5.91 vs 6.96 log cells/sample, respectively, p < 0.05) and of the species b. longum (4.05 and 4.79 vs 6.76, p < 0.05) than those with diverticulitis. conclusion: aberrancies in mucosa associated microbiota are present in different intestinal diseases. this may indicate a role of the microbiota in the pathogenesis of these diseases.

TI  == differential analysis of protein expression of bifidobacterium grown on different carbohydrates.
AB  == we observed recently that colonic fermentation of lactose might be a major factor in the pathophysiology of lactose intolerance. proteomic techniques could be helpful in interpreting the metabolic pathways of lactose fermentation. the objective of this study was to explore proteomic methodologies for studying bacterial lactose metabolism that can be used to detect and identify proteins associated with the onset of intolerance symptoms. differential expression of cytoplasmic proteins of bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium breve and bifidobacterium longum grown on different carbohydrates (lactose, glucose, galactose) was analyzed with surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization-time of flight (seldi-tof) ms and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page). after fractionation by sds-page, differentially-expressed proteins were identified with lc-ms/ms. the three strains grown on the same carbohydrate or the same strain grown on glucose or lactose showed differences in seldi-tof ms protein profiles. differences in protein expression were observed in b. breve grown on glucose, galactose or lactose as analyzed with sds-page. with lc-ms/ms, proteins from bifidobacterium were identified, which included enzymes for metabolism of lactose, glucose and galactose. in conclusion, the applied techniques can discern differences in protein expression of bacteria metabolizing different carbohydrates. these techniques are promising in studying metabolism of lactose and other substrates in a complex bacterial ecosystem such as the colonic microbiota.

TI  == different utilization of glucose and raffinose in bifidobacterium breve and bifidobacterium animalis.
AB  == growth of 2 strains of bifidobacterium breve and 4 strains of bifidobacterium animalis was evaluated with glucose, raffinose or a mixture of glucose and raffinose as substrates. all strains of b. animalis and one strain of b. breve grew more slowly on glucose than on raffinose or the mixture of glucose and raffinose; one strain of b. breve grew more rapidly on the mixture of glucose and raffinose than on raffinose while 2 strains of b. animalis grew faster on raffinose than on the mixture of raffinose and glucose. both strains of b. breve  utilized glucose and raffinose simultaneously. in contrast, all strains of b. animalis strains displayed atypical growth with rapid utilization of raffinose followed by slow utilization of glucose. the cell morphology of all strains of b. animalis was affected by the sugar used for cultivation: tiny and rather spherical cells were observed on glucose while on media with raffinose the cells  were large and had the species-specific shape. description of preferential utilization of various saccharides by bifidobacteria can contribute to the development of new synbiotic preparations and new cultivation media for bifidobacteria.

TI  == determination of survival, identity and stress resistance of probiotic bifidobacteria in bio-yoghurts.
AB  == aims: to determine the level of bifidobacteria in bio-yoghurts in the uk, identify the species, and compare the resistance of common bifidobacterium spp. to acidity and oxidative stress. methods and results: a storage trial of bio-yoghurts was carried out to determine the level and survival of bifidobacteria. the 16s rrna gene targeted pcr was used to identify the species.  acid tolerance was determined by introducing the organisms to ph-adjusted skimmed milk and enumerating during storage at 4 degrees c. oxidative stress resistance was determined using the h(2)o(2) disc diffusion assay technique. nine of 10 bio-yoghurts contained bifidobacteria at levels >10(6) cfu g(-1) at the time of purchase. the viability of the organism decreased during storage and on expiry only five products retained viability >10(6) cfu g(-1) while two others were very close to the target population. bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis showed superior survival abilities and stress tolerance compared with bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium longum biotype infantis. conclusions: bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis, the only bifidobacterium spp. found in bio-yoghurts, had the greatest resistance to acidity and oxidative stress. significance and impact of the study: the technological properties of b. animalis ssp. lactis make it suitable for inclusion in bio-yoghurts although its putative  health benefits need further investigation.

TI  == modulation of rat cecal microbiota by administration of raffinose and encapsulated bifidobacterium breve.
AB  == to investigate the effects of administration of raffinose and encapsulated bifidobacterium breve jcm 1192t cells on the rat cecal microbiota, in a preclinical synbiotic study groups of male wkah/hkm slc rats were fed for 3 weeks with four different test diets: basal diet (group bd), basal diet supplemented with raffinose (group raf), basal diet supplemented with encapsulated b. breve (group cb), and basal diet supplemented with both raffinose and encapsulated b. breve (group rcb). the bacterial populations in cecal samples were determined by  fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp). b. breve cells were detected only in the rcb group  and accounted for about 6.3% of the total cells as determined by fish analysis. b. breve was also detected only in the rcb group by t-rflp analysis. this was in  contrast to the cb group, in which no b. breve signals were detected by either fish or t-rflp. increases in the sizes of the populations of bifidobacterium animalis, a bifidobacterium indigenous to the rat, were observed in the raf and rcb groups. principal-component analysis of t-rflp results revealed significant alterations in the bacterial populations of rats in the raf and rcb groups; the population in the cb group was similar to that in the control group (group bd). to the best of our knowledge, these results provide the first clear picture of the changes in the rat cecal microbiota in response to synbiotic administration.

TI  == rapid identification of potentially probiotic bifidobacterium species by multiplex pcr using species-specific primers based on the region extending from 16s rrna through 23s rrna.
AB  == this study aimed at developing a novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr)  primer set for identification of the potentially probiotic bifidobacterium species b. adolescentis, b. animalis subsp. animalis (b. animalis), b. bifidum, b. breve, b. longum biovar infantis (b. infantis), b. animalis subsp. lactis b. lactis, b. longum biovar longum (b. longum) and b. pseudolongum. the primer set comprised specific and conserved primers and was derived from the integrated sequences of 16s and 23s rrna genes and the rrna intergenic spacer region (isr) of each species. it could detect and identify type strains and isolates from pharmaceuticals or dairy products corresponding to the eight bifidobacterium species with high specificity. it was also useful for screening of the related strains from natural sources such as the gastro-intestinal tract and feces. we suggest that the assay system from this study is an efficient tool for simple, rapid and reliable identification of bifidobacterium species for which probiotic  strains are known.

TI  == culture-dependent and culture-independent qualitative analysis of probiotic products claimed to contain bifidobacteria.
AB  == a total of 58 probiotic products obtained worldwide, which were claimed to contain bifidobacterium strains (including 22 yoghurts, 5 dairy fruit drinks, 28  food supplements and 3 pharmaceutical preparations) were investigated in parallel using a culture-dependent and a culture-independent approach. three isolation media previously reported as selective for bifidobacterium were evaluated for their suitability in the quality analysis of these products. subsequently, possible bifidobacterial colonies were picked from the best medium and identified by means of rep-pcr fingerprinting using the box primer (box-pcr). bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, formerly classified as bifidobacterium lactis, was most frequently found, but strains belonging to bifidobacterium longum biotypes longum and infantis, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium  breve were recovered also. in parallel, all products were also subjected to culture-independent analysis which involved a nested-pcr step on total bacterial  dna extracted directly from the product, followed by separation of the amplicons  by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and subsequent identification of species from the band patterns. by conventional cultivation, 70.7% of the products analysed were found to contain culturable bifidobacteria whereas by culture-independent dgge analysis members of the genus bifidobacterium could be detected in 96.5% of the analysed products. genotypic characterization of a number of bifidobacterial isolates at the strain level by means of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) revealed a relatively high degree of genomic homogeneity among the bifidobacterium strains currently used in the probiotic industry.

TI  == the effect of lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium spp. administration on the morphology of the gastrointestinal tract, liver and pancreas in piglets.
AB  == the aim of the study was to investigate the influence of administration of probiotic bacteria on morphology of the gastrointestinal tract, liver and pancreas. the experiment was performed on 15 piglets at the age from 3 to 35 days, intragastrically administered with bifidobacterium breve, b. animalis, and  lactobacillus acidophilus bacteria. in all piglets examined, the development of the gastrointestinal tract, liver and pancreas was observed to progress normally. after microflora administration to the piglets, an increase in the number of fibrocytes and fibroblasts was observed in the mucosa lamina propria of stomach and intestines. an increase was also reported in the number and activation of endocrine cells in the stomach and small intestines. the activity of alkaline and acid phosphatases, as well as succinic (sdh) and lactic (ldh) dehydrogenases, was found to be higher after the administration of probiotics. the administration of  bacteria, especially of lactobacillus acidophilus, caused an increase in the number of lymphocytes and lymphoid cells in lamina propria and intraepithelial lymphocytes in the small intestine. enhanced proliferation of crypt cells was observed in the crypts of intestinal glands; however, there were no statistically significant differences in the pcna index between the control and probiotic-administered groups. the performed study showed that the administration of probiotic bacteria has no negative impact on the morphology of the gastrointestinal tract, liver and pancreas and is found beneficial to its functioning and immune processes.

TI  == specific growth rate of bifidobacteria cultured on different sugars.
AB  == the ability of six bifidobacterial strains (3 of human origin and 3 isolates from fermented milk products) to utilize glucose, lactose, melezitose, sucrose, raffinose, and stachyose was determined. dairy-related bifidobacterial strains were identified as bifidobacterium animalis (2 strains) or as b. pseudolongum (1  strain). human strains included b. longum (2 strains) and b. breve (1 strain). all strains fermented lactose, sucrose, raffinose, and stachyose. melezitose was  utilized only by b. longum. b. pseudolongum did not ferment either glucose or melezitose. all isolates had a higher specific growth rate on raffinose and stachyose than on glucose. dairy strain grew slowly on glucose compared to human  strains.

TI  == production of oligosaccharides in yogurt containing bifidobacteria and yogurt cultures.
AB  == yogurts were prepared by using yogurt cultures combined to mixed cultures of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, and bifidobacterium longum) and  by adding a preincubation step (1.5 h at 50 degrees c) with bifidobacteria to the conventional method of manufacture in order to produce oligosaccharides. the survival of bifidobacteria was drastically affected during storage of yogurts, except for products containing b. animalis, in which viable counts remained at >10(6) cfu/g after 28 d of storage at 4 degrees c. oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization of 3 were produced during the preincubation step (0.31 to 0.68%), and the amount in the final products varied according to the species of bifidobacteria inoculated during the preincubation step or the concentration of bifidobacteria used as second inoculum during the fermentation process. in fact,  the higher concentration of oligosaccharides measured at the end of the fermentation process (0.72%) and the 28 d-storage period (0.67%) was obtained for yogurts containing b. infantis. however, yogurts containing b. breve showed higher beta-galactosidase activities and had lower lactose concentrations after the fermentation process and the storage period than the other yogurts. the use of a mixed cultures of bifidobacteria (b. animalis, b. infantis, or b. breve) thus allows the production of yogurts in which bifidobacteria can survive in relatively high cell numbers and contain appreciable amount of oligosaccharides.

TI  == molecular microbial analysis of bifidobacterium isolates from different environments by the species-specific amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra).
AB  == one hundred and six isolates of the genus bifidobacterium, isolated from different environments (mainly gastrointestinal), were identified and classified  taxonomically to species level by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. two restriction endonucleases (sau3ai and bamhi) were chosen for aligning the 16s rrna sequences of 16 bifidobacterial species retrieved from various databases, to obtain species-specific restriction patterns. a rapid and accurate identification scheme was obtained by comparing the resulting 16s rdna digestion profiles of 16  bifidobacterium type-strains and 90 strains of various origins. all of the investigated strains were previously confirmed at the species level as belonging  to the genus bifidobacterium by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation and by polymerase chain reaction amplification with genus- and species-specific primers. the present work demonstrates that species-specific detection of bifidobacterium  adolescentis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium  breve, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium coryneforme, bifidobacterium  cuniculi, bifidobacterium dentium, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium suis, bifidobacterium magnum, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and bifidobacterium pullorum present in different micro-ecological environments (e.g. gastrointestinal tract) can be accomplished in a reliable, rapid and accurate manner, circumventing the recognised deficiencies of traditional identification techniques.

TI  == adhesion of bifidobacterium spp. to human intestinal mucus.
AB  == twenty-four bifidobacterium strains were examined for their ability to bind to immobilized human and bovine intestinal mucus glycoproteins. each of the tested bacteria exhibited its characteristic adhesion to human and bovine fecal mucus. no significant differences were found among the taxonomic species. among the tested bacteria, b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. infantis, b. longum and b. pseudocatenulatum adhered to human fecal mucus better than bovine fecal mucus, while the binding of b. animalis and  b. lactis was not preferential. these results suggest that the mucosal adhesive properties of bifidobacteria may be a strain dependent feature, and the mucosal binding of the human bifidobacteria may be more host specific.

TI  == nucleotide sequence, expression and transcriptional analysis of the bifidobacterium longum mb 219 lacz gene.
AB  == the gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of escherichia coli from bifidobacterium longum mb219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten bifidobacterium strains tested of the species b. longum, b. breve, b. adolescentis, b. indicum, b. animalis and b. cuniculi. the nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to e. coli revealed the presence of a lacz-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site.  a sequence showing 72% identity with the proline trna of bacillus subtilis and a  gene probably encoding the dna-3-methyladenine glycosydase i were located downstream from the lacz gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. by primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacz gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the  -10 region of the putative promoter. the nucleotide sequence of lacz and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes  and enzymes from other microorganisms. high similarity was demonstrated between the b. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, e. coli, clostridium acetobutylicum, leuconostoc lactis, klebsiella pneumoniae and kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the lacz family. the b. longum mb219 lacz gene was cloned in bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. the expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.

TI  == effects of fructooligosaccharides and their monomeric components on bile salt resistance in three species of bifidobacteria.
AB  == the influence of fructooligosaccharides (fos) and their monomeric components on bile salt resistance of bifidobacterium breve atcc 15700, bif. longum atcc 15707  and bif. animalis atcc 25527 was examined. the neosugars induced fructofuranosidase activities for the degradation of these saccharides. for the three strains tested the growth was identical and bile salts had the same inhibitory effect on growth whatever the carbohydrate used. the survival of bif.  breve and bif. longum, in the presence of glycodeoxycholic acid depended, however, on carbohydrates: the toxic effects of the bile salt could be partly alleviated by the addition of a metabolizable c-source. for bif. animalis, the presence of any carbohydrate in the incubation medium did not enhance the viability of the strain. but in the three deconjugating strains of bifidobacteria studied, the presence of neosugar during the growth led to improved resistance to the bactericidal effect of the bile salt compared with the monomeric components of these neosugars (glucose and fructose).

TI  == development and application of an in vitro methodology to determine the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species in the upper human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == an in vitro methodology which mimics in vivo human upper gastrointestinal transit was developed. the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species was determined by exposing washed cell suspensions at 37  degrees c to a simulated gastric juice (ph 2.0), containing pepsin (0.3% w/v) and sodium chloride (0.5% w/v), and a simulated small intestinal juice (ph 8.0), containing pancreatin usp (1 g l-1) and sodium chloride (5 g l-1), and monitoring changes in total viable count periodically. the methodology was also employed to  determine the effect of adding milk proteins (1 g l-1), hog gastric mucin (1 g l-1) and soyabean trypsinchymotrypsin inhibitor [sbtci] (1 g l-1) on transit tolerance. the majority (14 of 15) of isolates lost > 90% viability during simulated gastric transit. only one isolate, lactobacillus fermentum kld, was considered intrinsically resistant. the addition of milk proteins, singly and in  combination, generally improved gastric transit tolerance. in this regard, two isolates, lact. casei 212.3 and bifidobacterium infantis 25962, exhibited 100% gastric transit tolerance in the presence of milk proteins. in general, the addition of hog gastric mucin did not influence simulated gastric transit tolerance of lactobacilli but tended to increase that of bifidobacteria. however, it increased that of lact. casei 242 and lact. salivarius 43338 but diminished that of b. bifidum 2715 and b. animalis bo. selected bile salts-resistant isolates were intrinsically tolerant to simulated small intestinal transit. only  lact. casei f19 and b. adolescentis 15703t showed significant reduction in viability after 240 min. in general, the addition of milk proteins and sbtci did  not affect simulated small intestinal transit tolerance. however, they significantly improved the intrinsic resistance of lact. casei f19 but diminished that of b. breve 15700t. it is concluded that, whereas the majority of bile salts-resistant lactobacilli and bifidobacteria may be intrinsically sensitive to gastric transit, they are intrinsically resistant to small intestinal transit. in addition, it is postulated that milk proteins and mucin may function as both buffering agents and inhibitors of digestive protease activity in vivo, thereby protecting ingested bacterial strains during upper gastrointestinal transit.

TI  == digoxigenin-labeled deoxyribonucleic acid probes for the enumeration of bifidobacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == the numbers of bifidobacteria in fecal samples were specifically determined by colony hybridization with the mixture of digoxigenin-labeled dna probes that were prepared from whole chromosomal dna of bifidobacterium longum 6001 and bifidobacterium adolescentis 6003. these dna probes strongly hybridized with dna  of b. longum, b. adolescentis, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium suis, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium angulatum, and bifidobacterium animalis. detectable positive signals with dna of bifidobacterium pseudolongum ssp. pseudolongum, bifidobacterium catenulatum, and bifidobacterium  thermophilum were also found after hybridization. when dot-blot hybridization was performed with whole cells of 47 reference strains containing 11 species (16 strains) of bifidobacteria, all of the bifidobacteria tested could be specifically detected by using these dna probes; lactobacillus fermentum jcm 1173, however, showed a slight nonspecific signal. the counts of bifidobacteria by colony hybridization in the fecal samples of four of the five subjects were the same as the counts that were obtained by the conventional method using bl agar medium. furthermore, no significant difference existed in the number of bifidobacteria that were determined by either method.

AB  == numerical analysis of phenotypic characteristics based on enzymatic activity and  carbohydrate fermentation allowed the discrimination of most strains of bifidobacteria of animal origin from those of human origin. strains of bifidobacteria studied were separated into nine groups based on numerical analysis. three groups contained most strains of animal origin, three groups comprised both strains of animal and human origin, and three groups were strictly composed of strains of human origin. the results indicate that one group of animal origin (group ii) contained all reference strains of bifidobacterium animals and 10 strains isolated from fermented milks or commercial preparations.  although numerical analysis of enzymatic activities and carbohydrate fermentation patterns allowed the differentiation of 'wild' strains of b. animalis and b. longum isolated from commercial preparations, this method failed to confirm the species. in the present study, the determination of electrophoretic patterns of beta-galactosidases resulted in the development of a new technique for the differentiation of bifidobacterium species. several isoenzymes of beta-galactosidase were detected among strains of bifidobacteria. each species had a specific electrophoretic pattern. the detection of beta-galactosidase by electrophoresis is a new tool for distinguishing between dairy- and non-dairy-related bifidobacteria. dairy-related bifidobacteria (b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis and b. longum) as well as b. animalis could be better differentiated from other bifidobacteria by comparison of their beta-galactosidase electrophoretic patterns, rather than by numerical analysis of their phenotypic characteristics.

TI  == phenotypic differentiation of bifidobacteria of human and animal origins.
AB  == the phenotypes of 153 strains belonging or related to the genus bifidobacterium were studied. these organisms included 38 collection strains and 115 wild strains (41 strains of human origin, 56 strains of animal origin, and 18 strains obtained from rivers or sewage). our phenotypic analysis revealed seven main groups that were subdivided into 20 subgroups. seven subgroups contained no type or collection strain. among the human strains, the type strains of bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and b. catenulatum fell into group i, which contained the type  strains of b. adolescentis (subgroup ib), b. dentium (subgroup ic), and b. angulatum (ungrouped). the type strain of b. breve belonged to subgroup iiia1, and the type strains of b. infantis and b. longum fell into subgroup iiib1. group vii comprised only wild strains that were isolated from human infant feces. among the animal strains, group ii consisted mainly of bifidobacteria that were isolated from pig feces and contained the type strains of b. suis (subgroup iib), b. thermophilum (subgroup iif), b. choerinum, and b. boum (ungrouped). wild strains belonging to group v were isolated from pig, calf, cow, and chicken feces; this included the type strains of b. animalis (subgroup va), b. magnum (subgroup vb), b. pseudolongum, and b. globosum (subgroup vc). the strains of human origin (groups i, iii, and vii) were well separated from the animal strains (groups ii, iv, and v). it was not surprising that the wild strains isolated from surface water or sewage were distributed in the animal groups as well as the human groups. thus, bifidobacteria can be considered to be successful indicators  of human or animal fecal pollution when they are correctly classified. the acidification patterns were not adequate to differentiate bifidobacterium species, as determined previously by mitsuoka (bifidobacteria microflora 3:11-28, 1984) and scardovi (p. 1418-1434, in p. h. a. sneath, n. s. mair, m. e. sharpe, and j. g. holt, ed., bergey's manual of systematic bacteriology, vol. 2, 1986). however, enzymatic tests furnished new taxonomic criteria for the genus.
