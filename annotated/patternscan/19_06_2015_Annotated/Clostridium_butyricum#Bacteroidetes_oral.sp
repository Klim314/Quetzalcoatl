TI  == destructive effects of butyrate on the cell envelope of helicobacter pylori.
AB  == helicobacter pylori can be found in the oral cavity and is mostly detected by the use of pcr techniques. growth of h. pylori is influenced by various factors in the mouth, such as the oral microflora, saliva and other antimicrobial substances, all of which make colonization of the oral cavity by h. pylori difficult. in the present study, we analysed the effect of the cell supernatant of a representative periodontal bacterium porphyromonas gingivalis on h. pylori and found that the cell supernatant destroyed the h. pylori cell envelope. as p.  gingivalis produces butyric acid, we focused our research on the effects of butyrate and found that it significantly inhibited the growth of h. pylori. h. pylori cytoplasmic proteins and dna were detected in the extracellular environment after treatment with butyrate, suggesting that the integrity of the cell envelope was compromised and indicating that butyrate has a bactericidal effect on h. pylori. in addition, levels of extracellular h. pylori dna increased following treatment with the cell supernatant of butyric acid-producing bacteria, indicating that the cell supernatant also has a bactericidal effect and that this may be due to its butyric acid content. in conclusion, butyric acid-producing bacteria may play a role in affecting h. pylori colonization of the oral cavity.
