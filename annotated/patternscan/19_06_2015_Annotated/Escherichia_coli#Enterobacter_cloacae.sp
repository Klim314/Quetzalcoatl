TI  == assessment of the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in ready-to-eat salads, fresh-cut fruit, and sprouts from the  swiss market.
AB  == ready-to-eat (rte) prepacked salads and fruit have been successfully marketed for the last decade in switzerland and are increasingly important as a component of everyday diets. to determine whether extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae are present in rte salads, fresh-cut fruit, and sprouts on the swiss market, samples of 238 mixed and unmixed rte produce from a large production plant and 23 sprout samples from two sprout farms were analyzed. further, four samples from the production plant's recycled wash water,  which is used for crop irrigation, were analyzed. twelve (5%) of the 238 rte products and one of the recycled wash water samples yielded esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae. strain identification and pcr analysis of the blaesbl genes revealed kluyvera ascorbata isolated from a tomato sample harboring a blactx-m-2-like gene; multidrug-resistant (mdr) enterobacter cloacae detected in  a chives sample imported from spain harboring the clinically important blactx-m-15 gene; and 10 serratia spp. isolated from mixed salads (blafona-2 and  blafona-2-like genes were found in 6 [60%] and blafona-4-like and blafona-5-like  genes were each found in 2 [20%] of the isolates). the recycled wash water sample tested positive for one extraintestinal pathogenic mdr escherichia coli b2:st131  harboring blactx-m-27 and for one mdr e. coli a:st88 containing blactx-m-3. none  of the sprout samples tested positive for esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae. overall, the majority of the enterobacteriaceae detected in swiss rte produce were environmental strains producing minor esbls. the detection of an isolate producing a clinically important esbl in a single sample and of an international  circulating pathogenic strain (b2:st131) in recycled wash water highlights the importance of surveillance of fresh produce and of recycled wash water that will  be reused for irrigation purposes.

TI  == antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities from jatropha dioica roots.
AB  == the antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of organic extracts obtained from roots of the medicinal plant jatropha dioica (euphorbiaceae) were investigated. in order to evaluate their antimicrobial activity, the organic extracts were tested against clinical isolates of the human pathogens bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, salmonella typhimurium, cryptococcus neoformans, candida albicans, candida parapsilosis and sporothrix schenckii. results revealed that the hexane extract possess the stronger activity and a broader microbicide spectrum compared to the acetone and ethanol extracts. the activity of hexane extract may be attributed in part to the presence of beta-sitosterol, the major compound identified by bioautography. the hexane extract, as well as the bioactive fraction were not cytotoxic when assays were profiled against the normal cell lines chang, ok and llcpk-1 (ic50>1000 mug ml(-1)).

TI  == molecular characteristics of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant enterobacteriaceae from humans in the community.
AB  == objective: to investigate the molecular characteristics of extended-spectrum cephalosporin (esc)-resistant enterobacteriaceae collected during a cross-sectional study examining the prevalence and risk factors for faecal carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae  in humans living in areas with high or low broiler density. methods: esc-resistant enterobacteriaceae were identified by combination disc-diffusion test. esbl/ampc/carbapenemase genes were analysed using pcr and sequencing. for e. coli, phylogenetic groups and mlst were determined. plasmids were characterized by transformation and pcr-based replicon typing. subtyping of plasmids was done by plasmid multilocus sequence typing. results: 175 esc-resistant enterobacteriaceae were cultured from 165/1,033 individuals. the isolates were escherichia coli(n=65), citrobacter freundii (n=52), enterobacter cloacae (n=38), morganella morganii (n=5), enterobacter aerogenes (n=4), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=3), hafnia alvei (n=2), shigella spp. (n=2), citrobacter amalonaticus (n=1), escherichia hermannii (n=1), kluyvera cryocrescens (n=1), and pantoea agglomerans (n=1). the following esbl genes were recovered in 55 isolates originating from 49 of 1,033 (4.7 %) persons: blactx-m-1 (n=17), blactx-m-15 (n=16), blactx-m-14 (n=9), blactx-m-2 (n=3), blactx-m-3 (n=2), blactx-m-24 (n=2), blactx-m-27 (n=1), blactx-m-32 (n=1), blashv-12 (n=2), blashv-65 (n=1) and blatem-52 (n=1). plasmidic ampc (pampc) genes were discovered in 6 out of 1,033 (0.6 %) persons. one person carried two different e. coli isolates, one with blactx-m-1 and the other with blacmy-2 and therefore the prevalence of persons carrying enterobacteriaceae harboring esbl and/or pampc genes was 5.2 %. in eight e. coli isolates the ampc phenotype was caused by mutations in the ampc promoter  region. no carbapenemase genes were identified. a large variety of e. coli genotypes was found, st131 and st10 being most common. conclusions: esbl/pampc genes resembled those from patients in dutch hospitals, indicating that healthy humans form a reservoir for transmission of these determinants to vulnerable people. the role of poultry in the transmission to humans in the community remains to be elucidated.

TI  == influence of 4'-o-glycoside constitution and configuration on ribosomal selectivity of paromomycin.
AB  == a series of 20 4'-o-glycosides of the aminoglycoside antibiotic paromomycin were  synthesized and evaluated for their ability to inhibit protein synthesis by bacterial, mitochondrial and cytosolic ribosomes. target selectivity, i.e., inhibition of the bacterial ribosome over eukaryotic mitochondrial and cytosolic  ribosomes, which is predictive of antibacterial activity with reduced ototoxicity and systemic toxicity, was greater for the equatorial than for the axial pyranosides, and greater for the d-pentopyranosides than for the l-pentopyranosides and d-hexopyranosides. in particular, 4'-o-beta-d-xylopyranosyl paromomycin shows antibacterioribosomal activity comparable to that of paromomycin, but is significantly more selective showing considerably reduced affinity for the cytosolic ribosome and for the a1555g mutant mitochondrial ribosome associated with hypersusceptibility to drug-induced ototoxicity. compound antibacterioribosomal activity correlates with antibacterial activity, and the ribosomally more active compounds show activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter baumannii, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa).  the paromomycin glycosides retain activity against clinical strains of mrsa that  are resistant to paromomycin, which is demonstrated to be a consequence of 4'-o-glycosylation blocking the action of 4'-aminoglycoside nucleotidyl transferases by the use of recombinant e. coli carrying the specific resistance determinant.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftolozane alone and in combination with tazobactam against extended spectrum beta-lactamase harboring enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == ceftolozane formally, cxa-101, is a new antipseudomonal cephalosporin that is also active in vitro against enterobacteriaceae, but is vulnerable to extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls). the addition of tazobactam is intended to broaden coverage of most esbl-producing e. coli and k. pneumonia as well as other enterobacteriaceae. the in vitro activities of ceftolozane/tazobactam combinations against 67 clinically and molecularly characterized esbl producing isolates were examined by checkerboard mic to evaluate its potential clinical feasibility and to assess the optimal tazobactam concentrations to be used in mic determinations of ceftolozane. isolates included escherichia coli (n=32), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=19), enterobacter cloacae (n=15) and 1 citrobacter freundii. checkerboard experiments were performed to study interactions over the  range of 0.008-64 mg/l ceftolozane and 0.063-32 mg/l tazobactam using two-fold dilution series. the mic50 and mic90 of ceftolozane alone for all isolates were 16 and >/=64 mg/l respectively. increasing concentrations of tazobactam resulted  in decreasing mics of ceftolozane. the 50th and 90th percentile concentrations of tazobactam required to reduce the mic of ceftolozane to 8 mg/l for all organisms  in this esbl collection were 0.5 and 4 mg/l respectively. for e. coli, k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae these values were 0.5 and 2, 1 and 16, and 0.5 and 4 mg/l respectively. when combined with a fixed amount of 4 mg/l tazobactam (current clsi concentration used for susceptibility testing), 90% of the isolates would have an mic of </=4 mg/l. the combination ceftolozane/tazobactam is a promising alternative option for treating infections due to esbl harboring isolates.

TI  == inhibition of aminoglycoside acetyltransferase resistance enzymes by metal salts.
AB  == aminoglycosides (ags) are clinically relevant antibiotics used to treat infections caused by both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, as well as mycobacteria. as with all current antibacterial agents, resistance to ags is an increasing problem. the most common mechanism of resistance to ags is the presence of ag-modifying enzymes (ames) in bacterial cells, with ag acetyltransferases (aacs) being the most prevalent. recently, it was discovered that zn(2+) metal ions displayed an inhibitory effect on the resistance enzyme aac(6')-ib in acinetobacter baumannii and escherichia coli. in this study, we explore a wide array of metal salts (mg(2+), cr(3+), cr(6+), mn(2+), co(2+), ni(2+), cu(2+), zn(2+), cd(2+), and au(3+) with different counter ions) and their inhibitory effect on a large repertoire of aacs [aac(2')-ic, aac(3)-ia, aac(3)-ib, aac(3)-iv, aac(6')-ib', aac(6')-ie, aac(6')-iid, and eis]. in addition, we determine the mic values for amikacin and tobramycin in combination  with a zinc pyrithione complex in clinical isolates of various bacterial strains  (two strains of a. baumannii, three of enterobacter cloacae, and four of klebsiella pneumoniae) and one representative of each species purchased from the  american type culture collection.

TI  == environmental monitoring of bacterial contamination and antibiotic resistance patterns of the fecal coliforms isolated from cauvery river, a major drinking water source in karnataka, india.
AB  == the present study focuses prudent elucidation of microbial pollution and antibiotic sensitivity profiling of the fecal coliforms isolated from river cauvery, a major drinking water source in karnataka, india. water samples were collected from ten hotspots during the year 2011-2012. the physiochemical characteristics and microbial count of water samples collected from most of the hotspots exhibited greater biological oxygen demand and bacterial count especially coliforms in comparison with control samples (p </= 0.01). the antibiotic sensitivity testing was performed using 48 antibiotics against the bacterial isolates by disk-diffusion assay. the current study showed that out of  848 bacterial isolates, 93.51% (n = 793) of the isolates were found to be multidrug-resistant to most of the current generation antibiotics. among the major isolates, 96.46% (n = 273) of the isolates were found to be multidrug-resistant to 30 antibiotics and they were identified to be escherichia  coli by 16s rdna gene sequencing. similarly, 93.85% (n = 107), 94.49% (n = 103),  and 90.22% (n = 157) of the isolates exhibited multiple drug resistance to 32, 40, and 37 antibiotics, and they were identified to be enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas trivialis, and shigella sonnei, respectively. the molecular studies suggested the prevalence of bla tem genes in all the four isolates and dhfr gene  in escherichia coli and sh. sonnei. analogously, most of the other gram-negative  bacteria were found to be multidrug-resistant and the gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus spp. isolated from the water samples were found to be methicillin  and vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. this is probably the first study  elucidating the bacterial pollution and antibiotic sensitivity profiling of fecal coliforms isolated from river cauvery, karnataka, india.

TI  == multidrug resistance found in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae from rural water reservoirs in guantao, china.
AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae have been isolated from humans and animals across the world. however, data on prevalence of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae from rural water reservoirs is limited. this study aimed to isolate and characterize esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae in rural water reservoirs in guantao, china. esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae were  found in 5 (16.7%) of 30 sampled rural water reservoirs. sixty-six individual isolates expressing an esbl phenotype were obtained in the present study. species identification showed that 42 representatives of escherichia coli, 17 klebsiella  pneumoniae, 4 raoultella planticola, and 3 enterobacter cloacae. twenty isolates  contained a single bla gene, including ctx-m (17 strains), tem (2 strains), and shv (1 strain). forty-six isolates contained more than one type of beta-lactamase genes. esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae isolated in this study were all multidrug resistant. these findings indicated that the serious contamination of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae in rural water reservoirs existed in guantao, china.

TI  == ceftazidime-avibactam activity tested against enterobacteriaceae isolates from u.s. hospitals (2011 to 2013) and characterization of beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  == ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml) inhibited 99.9% (20,698/20,709) of enterobacteriaceae isolates at </=8 mug/ml. this compound was  active against resistant subsets, including ceftazidime-nonsusceptible enterobacter cloacae (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5 mug/ml) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) phenotype isolates. an esbl phenotype was noted among 12.4% (1,696/13,692 isolates from targeted species) of the isolates, including 776 escherichia coli (12.0% for this species; mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), 721 klebsiella pneumoniae (16.3%; mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), 119 klebsiella oxytoca (10.3%; mic50/90, 0.06/0.25 mug/ml), and 80 proteus mirabilis (4.9%; mic50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/ml) isolates. the most common enzymes detected among esbl phenotype isolates from 2013 (n = 743) screened using a microarray-based assay were ctx-m-15-like (n = 307), kpc (n = 120), shv esbls (n = 118), and ctx-m-14-like (n = 110). kpc producers were highly resistant to comparators, and ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50/90, 0.5/2 mug/ml) and tigecycline (mic50/90, 0.5/1 mug/ml; 98.3% susceptible) were the most active agents against these strains. meropenem (mic50/90, </=0.06/</=0.06 mug/ml) and ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml) were active against ctx-m-producing isolates. other enzymes were also observed, and ceftazidime-avibactam displayed good activity against the isolates producing less common enzymes. among 11 isolates displaying ceftazidime-avibactam mic values of >8 mug/ml, three were k. pneumoniae strains producing metallo-beta-lactamases (all ceftazidime-avibactam mics, >32 mug/ml), with two ndm-1 producers and one k. pneumoniae strain carrying the blakpc-2 and blavim-4 genes. therapeutic options for isolates producing beta-lactamases may be limited, and ceftazidime-avibactam, which displayed good activity against strains, including those producing kpc enzymes, merits further study in infections where such organisms occur.

TI  == prospective multicenter study of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae from  83 hospitals in spain reveals high in vitro susceptibility to colistin and meropenem.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the impact of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) in spain in 2013 by describing the prevalence, dissemination, and geographic distribution of cpe clones, and their population structure and antibiotic susceptibility. from february 2013 to may 2013, 83 hospitals (about 40,000 hospital beds) prospectively collected nonduplicate enterobacteriaceae using the screening cutoff recommended by eucast. carbapenemase characterization was performed by phenotypic methods and confirmed  by pcr and sequencing. multilocus sequencing types (mlst) were determined for klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli. a total of 702 enterobacteriaceae isolates met the inclusion criteria; 379 (54%) were cpe. oxa-48 (71.5%) and vim-1 (25.3%) were the most frequent carbapenemases, and k. pneumoniae (74.4%), enterobacter cloacae (10.3%), and e. coli (8.4%) were the species most affected.  susceptibility to colistin, amikacin, and meropenem was 95.5%, 81.3%, and 74.7%,  respectively. the most prevalent sequence types (sts) were st11 and st405 for k.  pneumoniae and st131 for e. coli. forty-five (54.1%) of the hospitals had at least one cpe case. for k. pneumoniae, st11/oxa-48, st15/oxa-48, st405/oxa-48, and st11/vim-1 were detected in two or more spanish provinces. st11 isolates carried four carbapenemases (vim-1, oxa-48, kpc-2, and oxa-245), but st405 isolates carried oxa-48 only. a wide interregional spread of cpe in spain was observed, mainly due to a few successful clones of oxa-48-producing k. pneumoniae (e.g., st11 and st405). the dissemination of oxa-48-producing e. coli is a new finding of public health concern. according to the susceptibilities determined in vitro, most of the cpe (94.5%) had three or more options for antibiotic treatment.

TI  == detection and characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in high-risk patients in an irish tertiary care hospital.
AB  == background: extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae (esbl-e) are gram-negative, multi-drug-resistant organisms that are of major clinical significance among immunocompromised patients in high-risk areas in hospital settings. in ireland, the number of esbl-e bloodstream infections is increasing. aims: to conduct a prevalence study of esbl-e among immunocompromised patients in high-risk areas [intensive care unit (icu), liver transplantation and haematology/oncology wards], characterize any esbl genes detected by polymerase chain reaction (pcr), and perform epidemiological typing using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). methods: in total, 317 non-duplicate rectal swabs from patients in high-risk wards were screened anonymously for esbl-e carriage. positive isolates were characterized using pcr to detect blactx-m, blatem, blaoxa-1 and blashv esbl-e genes. clonal relationships of these isolates were investigated using pfge. findings: fifty (15.8%) high-risk patients were found to harbour esbl-e. prevalence rates of 21.9% (n = 28), 14.3% (n = 15) and 8.3% (n =  7) of esbl-e were isolated from patients on the liver transplantation, icu and haematology/oncology wards, respectively. seventy percent of esbl-e isolates carried more than one resistance gene. of the 25 esbl-producing escherichia coli  isolates typed by pfge, two pairs of two isolates demonstrated >80% homology, and four of the five esbl-producing enterobacter cloacae isolates typed by pfge demonstrated >80% homology, suggesting clonal relatedness and potential cross-transmission from individual patients. conclusion: a significant proportion of the patients screened were found to be colonized with esbl-e. typing revealed  three incidents of potential cross-infection. therefore, timely detection of esbl-e among patients in high-risk wards is critical for treatment and infection  control.

TI  == the carbapenem inactivation method (cim), a simple and low-cost alternative for the carba np test to assess phenotypic carbapenemase activity in gram-negative rods.
AB  == a new phenotypic test, called the carbapenem inactivation method (cim), was developed to detect carbapenemase activity in gram-negative rods within eight hours. this method showed high concordance with results obtained by pcr to detect genes coding for the carbapenemases kpc, ndm, oxa-48, vim, imp and oxa-23. it allows reliable detection of carbapenemase activity encoded by various genes in species of enterobacteriaceae (e.g., klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli and  enterobacter cloacae), but also in non-fermenters pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. the cim was shown to be a cost-effective and highly robust phenotypic screening method that can reliably detect carbapenemase activity.

TI  == carbapenem-nonsusceptible enterobacteriaceae in taiwan.
AB  == a total of 1135 carbapenem-resistant (nonsusceptible) enterobacteriaceae (cre) isolates were recovered between november 2010 and july 2012 (517 from 2010-2011 and 618 from 2012) from 4 hospitals in taiwan. carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) comprised 5.0% (57 isolates), including 17 kpc-2 (16 klebsiella pneumoniae and 1 escherichia coli), 1 ndm-1 (k. oxytoca), 37 imp-8 (26 enterobacter cloacae, 4 citrobacter freundii, 4 raoultella planticola, 1 k. pneumoniae, 1 e. coli and 1 k. oxytoca), and 2 vim-1 (1 e. cloacae, 1 e. coli). the kpc-2-positive k. pneumoniae were highly clonal even in isolates from different hospitals, and all were st11. imp-8 positive e. cloacae from the same hospitals showed higher similarity in pfge pattern than those from different hospitals. a total of 518 cre isolates (45.6%) were positive for blaesbl, while 704 (62.0%) isolates were blaampc-positive, 382 (33.6% overall) of which carried  both blaesbl and blaampc. ctx-m (414, 80.0%) was the most common blaesbl, while dha (497, 70.6%) and cmy (157, 22.3%) were the most common blaampc. co-carriage of blaesbl and blaampc was detected in 31 (54.4%) and 15 (26.3%) of the 57 cpe, respectively. kpc-2 was the most common carbapenemase detected in k. pneumoniae (2.8%), while imp-8 was the most common in e. cloacae (9.7%). all kpc-2-positive  cre were resistant to all three tested carbapenems. however, fourteen of the 37 imp-8-positive cre were susceptible to both imipenem and meropenem in vitro. intra- and inter-hospital spread of kpc-2-producing k. pneumoniae and imp-8-producing e. cloacae likely occurred. although the prevalence of cpe is still low, careful monitoring is urgently needed. non-susceptibility to ertapenem might need to be considered as one criterion of definition for cre in areas where imp type carbapenemase is prevalent.

AB  == the aim of the present study was to confirm the existence of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae carrying the bla ndm-1 gene in clinics in hainan province, china. collected clinical bacterial isolates that were enterobacteriaceae strains suspected of producing carbapenemase were used as experimental strains. drug resistance to imipenem, meropenem and other antibacterial agents was tested. imipenem/imipenem inhibitor (ip/ipi) e-testing was conducted to identify the bacterial strains that produced metallo-beta-lactamases. the bla ndm-1 drug resistance gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr), and agarose gel electrophoresis (age) and sequencing were conducted to identify the products. the species of the strains carrying the bla ndm-1 gene were determined using a biochemical identification system. through the ip/ipi e-test, 21 of the 30 collected enterobacteriaceae strains were found to be positive, indicating that 70% of the strains produced metallo-beta-lactamases. following bla ndm-1 gene pcr amplification, age and sequencing tests confirmed that nine of the strains carried the bla ndm-1 drug resistance gene. the biochemical identification system indicated that four of the strains were klebsiella pneumoniae, two were escherichia coli, two were enterobacter cloacae and one was enterobacter aerogenes. drug susceptibility testing in vitro demonstrated that the strains were 100% resistant to a broad spectrum antibiotic plus lactamase inhibitor, cephalosporins and carbapenems. however, they had high sensitivity rates to polymyxin b and tigecycline of 100 and 88.9%, respectively. the sensitivity rate  to amikacin was also high at 77.8%, whereas sensitivity to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin was moderate at rates of 44.4 and 33.3% respectively. this clinical study of enterobacteriaceae strains that carry the bla ndm-1 gene in hainan shows a bacterial tolerance that is different from that in previous studies, which requires further in-depth study.

TI  == predominance of kpc-3 in a survey for carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae  in portugal.
AB  == among the 2,105 enterobacteriaceae tested in a survey done in portugal, 165 were  nonsusceptible to carbapenems, from which 35 (26 klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 escherichia coli, 2 enterobacter aerogenes, and 3 enterobacter cloacae isolates and 1 klebsiella oxytoca isolate) were confirmed to be carbapenemase producers by the presence of 30 tn4401d-blakpc-3, 4 inti3-blages-5, and one inti1-blavim-2 gene, alone or in combination with other bla genes. the dissemination of blakpc-3 gene carried by an incf plasmid suggests lateral gene transfer as a major mechanism of dissemination.

TI  == a statistical approach for determination of disk diffusion-based cutoff values for systematic characterization of wild-type and non-wild-type bacterial populations in antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  == in this study, we introduce a new approach for determination of epidemiologic cutoffs (ecoffs) and resistant-population cutoffs (rcoffs) based on receiver operating characteristic (roc) curves. as an example, the method was applied for  determination of ecoffs for seven different beta-lactam antibiotics and wild-type populations of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae. in addition, rcoffs were determined for bacterial populations with defined resistance mechanisms ("resistotypes"), i.e., extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-positive e. coli, esbl-positive k. pneumoniae, and esbl-positive e. cloacae; ampc cephalosporinase-positive e. coli and ampc-positive k. pneumoniae;  and broad-spectrum beta-lactamase (bsbl)-positive e. coli. rcoffs and ecoffs are  instrumental for a systematic characterization of associations between resistotypes and wild-type populations.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam alone and in combination with avibactam against european gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == recent clinical isolates of key gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were collected in 2012 from hospitalised patients in medical centres in four european  countries (france, germany, italy and spain) and were tested using standard broth microdilution methodology to assess the impact of 4mg/l avibactam on the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam. against enterobacteriaceae, addition of avibactam significantly enhanced the level of activity of these antimicrobials. mic90 values (minimum inhibitory concentration that inhibits 90%  of the isolates) of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam for escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter  freundii and morganella morganii were reduced up to 128-fold or greater when combined with avibactam. a two-fold reduction in the mic90 of ceftazidime to 8mg/l was noted in pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates when combined with avibactam,  whereas little effect of avibactam was noted on the mic values of the test compounds when tested against acinetobacter baumannii isolates. avibactam had little effect on the excellent activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against haemophilus influenzae. it had no impact on the in vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftaroline against staphylococci and streptococci. this study demonstrates that addition of avibactam enhances the activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa but not against a. baumannii.

TI  == matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof) directly from positive blood culture flasks allows rapid identification of bloodstream infections in immunosuppressed hosts.
AB  == introduction: in immunosuppressed hosts, rapid identification of microorganisms of bloodstream infections is crucial to ensuring effective antimicrobial therapy. conventional culture requires up to 72 h from sample collection to pathogen identification. methods: we used the sepsityper kit and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof; microflex, bruker) directly from positive blood culture (bact/alert 3d, fn/fa vials; biomerieux) in comparison to standard culture methodology (vitek 2; biomerieux) for species identification. results: a total of 62 consecutive positive blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients (solid organ or hematopoietic transplant  recipients, or with febrile neutropenia) were analyzed. culture yielded gram-negative bacteria (gnb) in 27/62 (43.5%) and gram-positive (gpb) in 35/62 (56.5%) vials. for gnb, the predominant species identified by maldi-tof and confirmed by vitek were escherichia coli (16/16 correctly identified) and enterobacter cloacae (4/4), with a sensitivity and specificity of 92.6% and 100%, respectively. for gpb, predominant species were staphylococcus aureus (3/3), coagulase-negative staphylococci (12/24), and enterococcus faecium (6/6) with a sensitivity of 100%, 60%, and 100%, respectively. the median time from blood collection to species identification was 27.4 h with maldi-tof identification and 46.6 h with conventional methodology. conclusion: using maldi-tof directly from positive blood cultures allowed a shorter time to identification with high sensitivity and specificity in immunosuppressed patients.

TI  == enhanced biohydrogen production from beverage industrial wastewater using external nitrogen sources and bioaugmentation with facultative anaerobic strains.
AB  == in this work biohydrogen generation and its improvement possibilities from beverage industrial wastewater were sought. firstly, mesophilic hydrogen fermentations were conducted in batch vials by applying heat-treated (80 degrees  c, 30 min) sludge and liquid (lb-grown) cultures of escherichia coli xl1-blue/enterobacter cloacae dsm 16657 strains for bioaugmentation purposes. the results showed that there was a remarkable increase in hydrogen production capacities when facultative anaerobes were added in the form of inoculum. furthermore, experiments were carried out in order to reveal whether the increment occurred either due to the efficient contribution of the facultative anaerobic microorganisms or the culture ingredients (in particular yeast extract  and tryptone) supplied when the bacterial suspensions (lb media-based inocula) were mixed with the sludge. the outcome of these tests was that both the applied  nitrogen sources and the bacteria (e. coli) could individually enhance hydrogen formation. nevertheless, the highest increase took place when they were used together. finally, the optimal initial wastewater concentration was determined as 5 g/l.

TI  == rates of susceptibility of carbapenems, ceftobiprole, and colistin against clinically important bacteria collected from intensive care units in 2007: results from the surveillance of multicenter antimicrobial resistance in taiwan (smart).
AB  == background: data on susceptibility to ceftobiprole and colistin, and the complete evolutionary trends of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of important carbapenem agents among important pathogens collected in intensive care units (icus) in taiwan are lacking. methods: we surveyed the mic distribution patterns  of ceftobiprole and colistin and susceptibility profiles of some important pathogens collected from patients hospitalized in intensive care units (icus) of  major teaching hospitals throughout taiwan in 2007. we also investigated the rates of nonsusceptibility to powerful carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem) among four important species of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus mirabilis) collected during the same period. mic breakpoints recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute in 2014 were applied. results: colistin showed excellent in vitro activity (susceptibility rate, 96%) against acinetobacter baumannii isolates but  moderate (73-77% susceptibility rate) activity against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and e. cloacae. the ceftobiprole mic90 value was 4 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and 16 mug/ml for p. aeruginosa. the  phenotype of methicillin resistance did not markedly increase the mic value of ceftobiprole among s. aureus isolates. interestingly, the proportion of isolates  that displayed nonsusceptibility to imipenem was significantly higher among p. mirabilis isolates than among isolates of the other three enterobacteriaceae species, regardless of the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. conclusion: continuous monitoring of susceptibility profiles of icu pathogens to  important antibiotics is warranted to provide appropriate antimicrobial regimens  against infections in the icu.

TI  == utilization of blood cultures in danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  == this national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (bcs). a primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. from the danish microbiology database, we retrieved all bcs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the national patient registry. in total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one bc was taken. almost 50% of bcs were taken at admission. the chance of having a bc taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one bc  was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. ten species, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. an increase in bcs and positive bcs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. bcs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for s. pneumoniae particularly. a predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to s. aureus, e. faecium and k. pneumoniae. minor differences in bcs and positive bcs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. the study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.

TI  == in vitro fermentation of fructooligosaccharides with human gut bacteria.
AB  == fructooligosaccharides (fos) are one of the most studied prebiotics, selectively  stimulating the growth of health-promoting bacteria in the host. however, there is increasing evidence that commensal gut bacteria, such as bacteroides fragilis, clostridium butyricum, enterobacter cloacae, and even the pathogenic escherichia  coli ben2908, are also able to metabolize fos in vitro, and in some cases, fos displayed adverse effects. therefore, it is necessary to identify fos-metabolizing species that are present in the gut. unlike previous studies focusing on individual strains, this study used the traditional culture method combined with an alignment search on the gut bacteria database established from the human microbiome project (hmp). the alignment results showed that homologous  proteins for fos transporters and glycosidases were distributed in 237 of the 453 strains of gut bacteria. la506 msmk encoding the atp-binding protein and aec45 fosgh1 encoding glycoside hydrolase were most widely distributed, in 155 and 55 strains, respectively. seven of eight strains with both transporters and glycosidases were proven to be capable of metabolizing fos, while five strains without either transporters or glycosidases were not. fifteen species isolated from human feces and 11 species from the alignment search were identified to be fos-metabolizing, of which cronobacter sakazakii, marvinbryantia formatexigens, ruminococcus gnavus, and weissella paramesenteroides are reported here for the first time. thus, alignment search combined with the culture method is an effective method for obtaining a global view of the fos-metabolizing bacteria in  the gut and will be helpful in further investigating the relationship between fos and human gut bacteria.

AB  == in recent years, enterobacteriaceae isolates have increased their potential to become highly drug resistant by acquiring resistance to carbapenems, primarily due to the production of acquired carbapenemases. the carbapenemases detected in  enterobacteriaceae are largely of the kpc, vim, ndm, imp and oxa-48 types. although the epidemiological origin and geographic distribution of carbapenemases are clearly different, they all first appeared in the late 20th century. only a decade later, these enzymes have already become established and have expanded globally. an important epidemiological change has occurred in spain in recent years, characterized by a rapid increase in the number of cases of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe), causing both nosocomial outbreaks and single infections. the impact of cpe in spain is primarily due to oxa-48-producing and vim-1-producing klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, although other species such as escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae are also increasing. the emergence of cpe as a cause of community-onset infections is a matter of great concern. taking into account recent experience, and considering the fact that increasing numbers of patients are becoming infected by cpe and reservoirs of carbapenemases are growing globally, the trend of the cpe epidemic  points toward a rise in its incidence. to prevent a massive cpe pandemic, a well-coordinated response from all health professionals and national and supranational authorities is clearly needed.

TI  == in vitro susceptibility of characterized beta-lactamase-producing strains tested  with avibactam combinations.
AB  == avibactam, a broad-spectrum beta-lactamase inhibitor, was tested with ceftazidime, ceftaroline, or aztreonam against 57 well-characterized gram-negative strains producing beta-lactamases from all molecular classes. most  strains were nonsusceptible to the beta-lactams alone. against ampc-, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-, and kpc-producing enterobacteriaceae or pseudomonas aeruginosa, avibactam lowered ceftazidime, ceftaroline, or aztreonam  mics up to 2,048-fold, to </=4 mug/ml. aztreonam-avibactam mics against a vim-1 metallo-beta-lactamase-producing enterobacter cloacae and a vim-1/kpc-3-producing escherichia coli isolate were 0.12 and 8 mug/ml, respectively.

TI  == [trends in antibiotic resistance in medellin and municipalities of the metropolitan area between 2007 and 2012: results of six years of surveillance].
AB  == introduction: bacterial resistance is a global phenomenon, but it presents geographic and temporal variations; this is the importance of local surveillance  programs. objective: to determine trends in antibiotic resistance in hospitals between 2007 and 2012 in medellin and its metropolitan area. materials and methods: percentages of antibiotic resistance between 2007 and 2012 in 22 institutions were obtained using whonet 5.6 program. for interpretation of susceptibility results, clsi standards of 2009 and 2012 were used. using the epi-info 6.04 program a trends analysis of antibiotic resistance was done using the chi-square for linear trend with a confidence level of 95%, a value of p=0.05 was considered significant. results: in six years of surveillance of antibiotic resistance we found a decrease of oxacillin resistance in staphylococcus aureus (p=0.0006) and an increase of vancomycin resistance in enterococcus faecium (p=0.0000). in escherichia coli and serratia marcescens an increase of resistance to ceftazidime was found, in contrast to a decrease in klebsiella pneumoniae (p=0.0000) and enterobacter cloacae (p=0.058). k. pneumoniae , s. marcescens and  e. cloacae showed an increase of carbapenem resistance in contrast to a reduction of carbapenem resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii .  conclusions: the resistance surveillance identified important findings as the emergence of e. faecium resistant to vancomycin and carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae . it is essential to determine the antibiotic use in the region to establish their influence on the resistance profiles, as well as ensuring the quality of information and microbiological procedures in the microbiology laboratories.

TI  == characterization of beta-lactamases in faecal enterobacteriaceae recovered from healthy humans in spain: focusing on ampc polymorphisms.
AB  == the intestinal tract is a huge reservoir of enterobacteriaceae, some of which are opportunist pathogens. several genera of these bacteria harbour intrinsic antibiotic resistance genes, such as ampc genes in species of citrobacter, enterobacter or escherichia genera. in this work, beta-lactamases and other resistance mechanisms have been characterized in enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from healthy human faecal samples, focusing on the ampc beta-lactamase  genes. fifty human faecal samples were obtained, and 70 enterobacteriaceae bacteria were isolated: 44 escherichia coli, 4 citrobacter braakii, 9 citrobacter freundii, 8 enterobacter cloacae, 1 proteus mirabilis, 1 proteus vulgaris, 1 klebsiella oxytoca, 1 serratia sp. and 1 cronobacter sp. a high percentage of resistance to ampicillin was detected (57 %), observing the ampc phenotype in 22  isolates (31 %) and the esbl phenotype in 3 isolates. ampc molecular characterization showed high diversity into bla cmy and bla act genes from citrobacter and enterobacter species, respectively, and the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) analysis demonstrated low clonality among them. the prevalence of people colonized by strains carrying plasmid-mediated ampc genes obtained in this study was 2 %. the unique plasmid-mediated bla ampc identified in this study was the bla cmy-2 gene, detected in an e. coli isolate ascribed to  the sequence type st405 which belonged to phylogenetic group d. the hybridization and conjugation experiments demonstrated that the isecp1-bla cmy-2-blc structure  was carried by a ~78-kb self-transferable inck plasmid. this study shows a high polymorphism among beta-lactamase genes in enterobacteriaceae from healthy people microbiota. extensive ampc-carrier studies would provide important information and could allow the anticipation of future global health problems.

TI  == genetic analysis of maintenance of pec156, a naturally occurring escherichia coli plasmid that carries genes of the ecoviii restriction-modification system.
AB  == in the present study the role of the mechanisms responsible for maintenance of a  natural plasmid pec156, that carries genes of the ecoviii restriction-modification system was investigated. analysis of this plasmid's genetic content revealed the presence of genetic determinants suggesting two such mechanisms. the first of them relies on site specific recombination utilizing the xer/cer molecular machinery, while the second involves a restriction-modification system as an addiction module. our analysis indicated that three factors affect the maintenance of pec156: (i) a cis-acting cer site involved in resolution of plasmid multimers, (ii) a gene coding for ecoviii endonuclease, and (iii) plasmid copy number control. the lowest stability was observed with pec156 derivatives deprived of the cer site. decreased stability of pec156 derivatives was also observed in e.coli strains deficient in genes coding for proteins involved in plasmid multimer resolution (xerc, xerd, argr and pepa). a similar effect, but to a much lesser extent was observed for the pec156 derivative without a functional  gene coding for ecoviii endonuclease. our results indicate that the presence of the cer site is more important for pec156 stable maintenance than the presence of a functional gene coding for ecoviii endonuclease. in our work we also tested maintenance of pec156 possessing a cole1-type replicon in bacteria belonging to enterobacteriaceae family. we have found that pec156 was most stably maintained in enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca representing coli-type enterobacteria. we have found that in all enterobacteria tested pec156 derivatives deficient in the cer site were significantly less stably maintained than cer(+) variants.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftazidime-avibactam combination in in vitro checkerboard assays.
AB  == to evaluate the in vitro effects of the combination of ceftazidime and avibactam  on the mics of both compounds, checkerboard assays were performed for 81 clinical strains, including 55 enterobacteriaceae strains (32 klebsiella pneumoniae, 19 escherichia coli, 1 citrobacter freundii, and 3 enterobacter cloacae) and 26 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, all with known resistance mechanisms such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) and carbapenemases, phenotypically or molecularly determined. phenotypically ceftazidime-resistant strains (n=69) were  analyzed in more detail. for the enterobacteriaceae strains, a concentration-dependent effect of avibactam was found for most strains with a maximum effect of avibactam at a concentration of 4 mg/liter, which decreased all ceftazidime mics to </=4 mg/liter. avibactam alone also showed antibacterial activity (the mic50 and mic90 being 8 and 16 mg/liter, respectively). for the ceftazidime-resistant p. aeruginosa strains, considerable inhibition of beta-lactamases by avibactam was acquired at a concentration of 4 mg/liter, which decreased all ceftazidime mics except one to </=8 mg/liter (the clsi and eucast susceptible breakpoint). increasing the concentration of avibactam further decreased the mics, resulting in a maximum effect for most strains at 8 to 16 mg/liter. in summary, for most strains, the tested addition of avibactam of 4 mg/liter restored the antibacterial activity of ceftazidime to a level comparable to that of wild-type strains, indicating full inhibition, and strains became susceptible according to the eucast and clsi criteria. based on these in vitro data, avibactam is a promising inhibitor of different beta-lactamases, including  esbls and carbapenemases.

TI  == microbial evaluation of sandboxes located in urban area.
AB  == this paper presents the results of a study on the degree of bacteriological pollution of sandboxes situated in fenced and unfenced housing estates located in an urban area in olsztyn, poland. heterotrophic plate counts (hpc22, hpc37), enterobacteriaceae, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., staphylococcus spp. and  clostridium perfringens determined by cultivation and fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) methods were used as indicators of the sanitary state. their maximum number in the sand samples reached values of up to 5.4x10(7), 2.6x10(6),  3.3x10(4), 2.1x10(3), 1.8x10(4), 1.9x10(1) and 1.2x10(4)cfu/g, respectively. it was found that values of culture-independent method were two-four orders greater  than those obtained by the cultivation method. among identified enterobacteriaceae, pantoea spp. and enterobacter cloacae were the most numerous, whereas escherichia cells were detected only occasionally. pathogenic bacteria of the genus salmonella sp. were isolated from sandboxes also when e. coli were absent. bacteria from staphylococcus genus were isolated irrespective of the site and time of sampling. additionally, the presence of molds and yeasts was studied. maximum counts of these microorganisms amounted to 1.0x10(5) and to 3.5x10(4)cfu/g. aspergillus, penicillium, alternaria and trichoderma genera were  most numerous among molds, whereas trichosporon was detected most frequently among yeasts. sandboxes in the fenced housing estate and those located in the area which is not close to trees were less polluted than the sand collected from  sandboxes in the unfenced housing estate. potentially pathogenic bacteria of the  genus salmonella spp. were identified in analyzed sandboxes, also when toxocara and e. coli were absent. it seems that assessing the contamination of children's  play areas basing only on fecal bacteria counts and by monitoring number of parasites' eggs may be insufficient to evaluate microbial pollution of sandboxes  and may not fully reflect their safety for children.

TI  == prevalence and diversity of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae from marine beach waters.
AB  == a total of 1,351 enterobacteriaceae isolates from 144 seawater samples were collected over a four-year period from three public beaches in the eastern adriatic sea in croatia. approximately 35% of the strains were multidrug-resistant. blaesbl genes were detected in 4.2% of the isolated enterobacteriaceae, the main species of which were escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae. blatem-1+shv-12 was the most dominant genotype, followed by blactx-m-15.raoultella terrigena and e. intermedius simultaneously harboured blatem-1,blashv-11/12 and blactx-m-15. isolate fingerprinting revealed that marine e. coli isolates were clonally related to ctx-m-producing strains from a regional university hospital. these results indicate that marine beach waters are reservoirs of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae and thus constitute a public health problem with further potential to act as mediators in gene flow between marine coastal areas and clinical settings.

TI  == enterobacteria identification and detection of diarrheagenic escherichia coli in  a port complex.
AB  == the port complex of maranhao (pcm) is the second largest port complex in brazil,  receiving ships with large volumes of ballast water. to evaluate the microbiological quality of its waters, physicochemical parameters (ph and salinity), the number of coliforms (thermotolerants and totals), and the presence of enterobacterias and diarrheagenic escherichia coli strains were analyzed. in order to identify the presence of e. coli virulence genes target regions of the stx, elt, est, aggr, cvd432, ipah and eae nucleotide sequences were studied. the  presence of totals and thermotolerants coliforms were positive. analyzing the salinity parameter, a significant increase in total coliforms was observed during the rainy season. we identified the species escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella ozaenae, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae and edwardsiella tarda. out of the 51 e. coli isolated, two were positive for the elt gene and one was positive  for the cvd432 sequence, features of enterotoxigenic and enteroaggregative strains, respectively. this study reveals that the pcm is contaminated by enterobacteria and diarrheagenic e.coli thus providing evidence regarding the risk of these bacteria being carried by ships to other countries, and draws attention to the input of fecal bacteria brought by ships in the port waters of maranhao.

TI  == countrywide spread of oxa-48 carbapenemase in lebanon: surveillance and genetic characterization of carbapenem-non-susceptible enterobacteriaceae in 10 hospitals over a one-year period.
AB  == objectives: to detect, characterize, and assess the genetic clonality of carbapenem-non-susceptible enterobacteriaceae in 10 lebanese hospitals in 2012. methods: selected enterobacteriaceae isolates with reduced susceptibility to carbapenems were subject to phenotypic study including antibiotic susceptibility, cloxacillin effect, modified hodge test, and activity of efflux pump inhibitor. carbapenemase genes were detected using pcr; clonal relatedness was studied by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. results: out of 8717 enterobacteriaceae isolated in 2012, 102 (1.2%) showed reduced susceptibility to carbapenems. thirty-one (70%) of the 44 studied clinical isolates harbored blaoxa-48, including 15 klebsiella pneumoniae, eight escherichia coli, four serratia marcescens, three enterobacter cloacae, and one morganella morganii. the majority of oxa-48 producers co-secreted an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, while one had an acquired ampc of the acc type. in the non-oxa-48 producers, carbapenem resistance was attributed to the production of acquired ampc cephalosporinases of mox or cit type, outer membrane impermeability, and/or efflux pump overproduction. dna fingerprints revealed that oxa-48 producers were different, except for clonal relatedness among four k. pneumoniae, two e. coli, two e. cloacae, and three s. marcescens. conclusions: nosocomial carbapenem-non-susceptible enterobacteriaceae are moderately spread in lebanon and the predominant mechanism is oxa-48 production.

TI  == antimicrobial co-resistance patterns of gram-negative bacilli isolated from bloodstream infections: a longitudinal epidemiological study from 2002-2011.
AB  == background: increasing multidrug resistance in gram-negative bacilli (gnb) infections poses a serious threat to public health. few studies have analyzed co-resistance rates, defined as an antimicrobial susceptibility profile in a subset already resistant to one specific antibiotic. the epidemiologic and clinical utility of determining co-resistance rates are analyzed and discussed. methods: a 10-year retrospective study from 2002-2011 of bloodstream infections with gnb were analyzed from three hospitals in greater vancouver, bc, canada. descriptive statistics were calculated for antimicrobial resistance and co-resistance. statistical analysis further described temporal trends of antimicrobial resistance, correlations of resistance between combinations of antimicrobials, and temporal trends in co-resistance patterns. results: the total number of unique blood stream isolates of gnb was 3280. increasing resistance to  individual antimicrobials was observed for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. cloacae, and p. aeruginosa. ciprofloxacin resistance in e. coli peaked in 2006 at 40% and subsequently stabilized at 29% in 2011, corresponding to decreasing ciprofloxacin usage after 2007, as assessed by defined daily dose utilization data. high co-resistance rates were observed for ceftriaxone-resistant e. coli with ciprofloxacin (73%), ceftriaxone-resistant k. pneumoniae with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (83%), ciprofloxacin-resistant e. cloacae with ticarcillin-clavulanate (91%), and piperacillin-tazobactam-resistant p. aeruginosa with ceftazidime (83%). conclusions: increasing antimicrobial resistance was demonstrated over the study period, which may partially be associated with antimicrobial consumption. the study of co-resistance rates in multidrug resistant gnb provides insight into the epidemiology of resistance acquisition, and may be used as a clinical tool to aid prescribing empiric antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == supporting the ceftaroline fosamil/avibactam enterobacteriaceae breakpoint determination using humanised in vivo exposures in a thigh model.
AB  == previous in vivo studies using a human-simulated regimen of ceftaroline/avibactam 600/600mg every 8h (q8h) showed activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-, ampc- and kpc-producing enterobacteriaceae with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) </= 1 mug/ml. here we sought to determine the efficacy of this human-simulated regimen against organisms with mics >/= 1 mug/ml to help determine a breakpoint value that would reliability predict efficacy in humans. in total, 31 isolates (1 escherichia coli, 9 klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 enterobacter cloacae, 1 citrobacter koseri, 2 serratia marcescens, 1 klebsiella oxytoca and 8 pseudomonas aeruginosa) with ceftaroline/avibactam mics of 1 to 16  mug/ml were tested in a murine immunocompromised thigh infection model; 15 isolates were also tested in an immunocompetent model. doses were given to simulate human free drug exposures of ceftaroline fosamil/avibactam 600/600 mg q8h over 24h as a 1-h infusion by targeting the ft>mic profile. efficacy was evaluated as the change in log10 cfu compared with 0-h controls after 24h. reductions in bacterial cfu in the neutropenic model were seen against a majority of isolates tested with mics </= 4 mug/ml, where ft>mic was >55%. more variable efficacy was seen in isolates with mics >/= 8 mug/ml, where ft>mic drops below 40%. overall activity was enhanced in the immunocompetent model. the humanised regimen of ceftaroline fosamil/avibactam 600/600 mg q8h as a 1-h infusion showed  predictable efficacy against isolates with various genotypic and phenotypic profiles and mics </= 4 mug/ml. these data provide valuable information to help determine a ceftaroline/avibactam breakpoint for enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == prevalence and characterization of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in a tunisian hospital.
AB  == the objective of the study was to assess the prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (pmqr) genes (qnra, qnrb, qnrc, qnrd, qnrs, aac(6')-ib-cr, qepa, and oqxab) in a collection of 120 extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls)-producing enterobacteria and to characterize them. overall, pmqr determinants were detected in 72 (60%) isolates (20 escherichia coli, 32 klebsiella pneumoniae, and 20 enterobacter cloacae). pmqr frequencies were as follows: qnr genes (25.8%), oqxab (21.6%), and aac(6')-ib-cr variant (19.2%). four qnr alleles were identified as qnrb1 (83.8%), qnrb4 (6.4%), qnrb2 (3.2%), and qnrs1 (6.4%). qnr genes were mainly detected in e. cloacae (50%), aac(6')-ib-cr in e. coli (47.5%), and oqxab in k. pneumoniae (65%). overall, blactx-m-15 (90.3%) was the most prevalent blaesbl type followed by blashv-12 (6.4%) and blashv-27 (2.7%). rates of mutations in gyra and parc genes were 75% for e. coli, 72.8% for k. pneumoniae, and 50% for e. cloacae. isolates with mutations in their quinolone resistance-determining regions exhibited high fluoroquinolones resistance levels compared to those with wild ones. genetic study of pmqr-harboring isolates revealed a great genomic diversity among each enterobacteriaceae species. our findings indicate the high prevalence of pmqr determinants among esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates from our hospital and their diffusion in various unrelated ctx-m-15-producing clones.

TI  == single-molecule sequencing to track plasmid diversity of hospital-associated carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == public health officials have raised concerns that plasmid transfer between enterobacteriaceae species may spread resistance to carbapenems, an antibiotic class of last resort, thereby rendering common health care-associated infections  nearly impossible to treat. to determine the diversity of carbapenemase-encoding  plasmids and assess their mobility among bacterial species, we performed comprehensive surveillance and genomic sequencing of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae in the national institutes of health (nih) clinical center patient population and hospital environment. we isolated a repertoire of carbapenemase-encoding enterobacteriaceae, including multiple strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and pantoea species. long-read genome sequencing with full end-to-end assembly revealed that these organisms carry the carbapenem  resistance genes on a wide array of plasmids. k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae isolated simultaneously from a single patient harbored two different carbapenemase-encoding plasmids, indicating that plasmid transfer between organisms was unlikely within this patient. we did, however, find evidence of horizontal transfer of carbapenemase-encoding plasmids between k. pneumoniae, e.  cloacae, and c. freundii in the hospital environment. our data, including full plasmid identification, challenge assumptions about horizontal gene transfer events within patients and identify possible connections between patients and the hospital environment. in addition, we identified a new carbapenemase-encoding plasmid of potentially high clinical impact carried by k. pneumoniae, e. coli, e. cloacae, and pantoea species, in unrelated patients and in the hospital environment.

TI  == mlst reveals potentially high-risk international clones of enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == objectives: to perform the first multinational enterobacter cloacae clonality study, using the mlst scheme newly developed in japan. methods: the analysis included 195 rectal carriage e. cloacae isolates resistant to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins (escs), collected from patients in 12 hospital units across europe and israel. all of the isolates were typed by pfge and 173 isolates were subjected to mlst. esc resistance was analysed phenotypically; genes encoding esbls and carbapenemases were identified by pcr and sequencing. results: mlst distinguished 88 sts, which correlated with the pfge data. pfge was more discriminatory, producing 129 pulsotypes (169 patterns). numerous sts were observed in several countries each. the most widespread were st66, st78, st108 and st114, each having at least 10 isolates from three to five countries, diversified into multiple pulsotypes, with clusters of related isolates in one or more centres. analysis of the sts against the mlst database revealed several epidemic clonal complexes, such as those with central genotypes st74 (including st78) or st114 (including st66). esc resistance was equally related to overexpression of the ampc cephalosporinase and to esbl production. among esbl producers some spreading subclones were identified, including specific st66, st78 and st114 pulsotypes, associated with ctx-m-15 production. several isolates produced carbapenemase vim-1 or kpc-2. conclusions: together with the information available in the mlst database, our results suggest that, like escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, e. cloacae harbours clonal lineages of increased epidemic potential that may be associated with resistance spread.

TI  == trends in bacterial wound isolates and antimicrobial susceptibility in a pediatric burn hospital.
AB  == the purpose of this retrospective study was to collate data dealing with organisms cultured from the burn patients and evaluate trends in antimicrobial susceptibility. all cultures collected from each acute admission patient between  2004 and 2011 in the 30-bed pediatric burn hospital were evaluated for their annual frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility. duplicate cultures were excluded. staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (25% of total isolates; range, 69-408 isolates/yr), followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa (13%; range, 40-202 isolates/yr), coagulase-negative staphylococci (9%; range, 2-188 isolates/yr), enterobacter cloacae (8%; range, 22-128 isolates/yr), and escherichia coli (6%; range, 19-91 isolates/yr). this rank order remained relatively consistent during the period of study. the emergence of methicillin-resistant s. aureus increased from 20% in 2004 to about 45% in 2009 to 2011. susceptibility to vancomycin was still 100%. in comparing periods 2004 to 2007 and 2008 to 2011, p. aeruginosa showed increased susceptibility to cefepime (from 76% to 84%) and the aminoglycosides (from 68% to 81%), whereas susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam remained high (from 91% to 93%). e. cloacae demonstrated 90 to 100% susceptibility to aminoglycosides, cefepime, and  imipenem. e. coli showed an increased rate of resistance to ceftazidime but was still susceptible to imipenem and amikacin. s. aureus and p. aeruginosa continue  to be the most prevalent organisms cultured from our pediatric burn population. almost half of the staphylococcal isolates were methicillin-resistant s. aureus.  despite widespread use of piperacillin-tazobactam, p. aeruginosa susceptibility remained high. several classes of antimicrobials continued to demonstrate good to excellent activity against the majority of organisms cultured from the burn patients.

TI  == genetic and kinetic characterization of the novel ampc beta-lactamases dha-6 and  dha-7.
AB  == during a spanish surveillance study, two natural variants of dha beta-lactamases, dha-6 and dha-7, were found, with the replacements ala226thr and phe322ser, respectively, with respect to dha-1. the dha-6 and dha-7 enzymes were isolated from escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae clinical isolates, respectively. the aim of this study was to genetically, microbiologically, and biochemically characterize the dha-6 and dha-7 beta-lactamases. the bladha-6 and bladha-7 genes were located in the i1 and hi2 incompatibility group plasmids of 87.3 and 310.4 kb, respectively. the genetic contexts of bladha-6 and bladha-7 were similar to that already described for the bladha-1 gene and included the qnrb4 and aada genes. the mics for cephalothin, aztreonam, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime were 8- to 32-fold lower for dha-6 than for dha-1 or dha-7 expressed in the same isogenic e. coli tg1 strain. interestingly, the mic for cefoxitin was higher in the dha-6-expressing transformant than in dha-1 or dha-7. biochemical studies with pure beta-lactamases revealed slightly lower catalytic efficiencies of dha-6 against cephalothin, ceftazidime, and cefotaxime than those of dha-1 and dha-7. to understand this behavior, stability experiments were carried out and showed that the dha-6 protein displayed significantly higher stability than the dha-1 and dha-7 enzymes. the proximity of thr226 to the n terminus in the tertiary protein structure in dha-6 may promote this stabilization and, consequently, may  induce a slight reduction in the dynamic of this enzyme that primarily affects the hydrolysis of some of the bulkiest antibiotics.

TI  == french regional surveillance program of carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacilli: results from a 2-year period.
AB  == in february 2011, the carb-lr group was created as a sentinel laboratory-based surveillance network to control the emergence of carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacilli (cr gnb) in a french southern region. we report the epidemiological results of a 2-year study. all the gram-negative bacilli isolates detected in the different labs (hospital and community settings) of a french southern region and with reduced susceptibility to ertapenem and/or imipenem were characterised with regard to antibiotic resistance, bla genes content, repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (rep-pcr) profiles and multilocus sequence typing (mlst). a total of 221 strains were analysed. acinetobacter baumannii was the most prevalent carbapenemase-producing bacteria, with a majority of oxa-23 producers (n = 37). one isolate co-produced oxa-23 and oxa-58  enzymes. klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequent carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) (oxa-48 producer: n = 29, kpc producer: n = 1), followed by escherichia coli (oxa-48 producer: n = 8, kpc producer: n = 1) and enterobacter cloacae (oxa-48 producer, n = 1). one isolate of pseudomonas aeruginosa produced a vim-1 carbapenemase. a clonal diversity of carbapenemase-producing k. pneumoniae and e. coli was noted with different mlsts. on the other hand, almost all oxa-23-producing a. baumannii strains belonged to the widespread st2/international clone ii. the link between the detection of cr gnb and a foreign country was less obvious, suggesting the beginning of a local cross-transmission. the number of cr gnb cases in our french southern region has  sharply increased very recently due to the diffusion of oxa-48 producers.

TI  == antibiotic consumption and its influence on the resistance in enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == background: increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics is one of the most serious problems in current medicine. an important factor contributing to the growing prevalence of multiresistant bacteria is application of antibiotics. this study aimed at analyzing the development of resistance of enterobacteriaceae to selected beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone and aminoglycoside antibiotics in the university hospital olomouc and assessing the effect of selection pressure of these antibiotics. methods: for the period between 1 january 2000 and 31 december 2011, resistance of klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis to third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, meropenem,  piperacillin/tazobactam, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides was retrospectively studied. for the assessment of selection pressure of antibiotics, a parameter of  defined daily dose in absolute annual consumption (dddatb) based on the atc/ddd classification and in relative annual consumption (rdddatb) as the number of defined daily doses per 100 bed-days was used. the relationship between frequency of strains resistant to a particular antibiotic and antibiotic consumption was assessed by linear regression analysis using spearman's correlation. the level of statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. results: a total of 113,027 isolates from the enterobacteriaceae family were analyzed. there was a significant effect of selection pressure of the primary antibiotic in the following cases: piperacillin/tazobactam in klebsiella pneumoniae, gentamicin in  klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli and amikacin in escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae. also, there was significant correlation between resistance  to ceftazidime and consumption of piperacillin/tazobactam in klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli. no relationship was found between consumption of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins and resistance to ceftazidime or between fluoroquinolone consumption and resistance to ciprofloxacin. conclusion:  the study showed the effects of both direct and indirect selection pressure on increasing resistance to gentamicin, amikacin, piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime. given the fact that no correlation was found between resistance to fluoroquinolones and consumption of either primary or secondary antibiotics, we assume that the increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones is probably due to circulation of resistance genes in the bacterial population and that this resistance was not affected by reduced use of these antibiotics.

TI  == rapid detection of bacteria in green tea using a novel pretreatment method in a bioluminescence assay.
AB  == tea is one of the most popular beverages consumed in the world, and green tea has become a popular beverage in western as well as asian countries. a novel pretreatment method for a commercial bioluminescence assay to detect bacteria in  green tea was developed and evaluated in this study. pretreatment buffers with ph levels ranging from 6.0 to 9.0 were selected from mes (morpholineethanesulfonic acid), hepes (n-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-n'-2-ethanesulfonic acid), or tricine buffers. to evaluate the effect of pretreatment and the performance of the assay, serially diluted cultures of enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, and staphylococcus aureus were tested. the improved methods, which consisted of a pretreatment of the sample in alkaline buffer, significantly decreased the background bioluminescence intensity of green tea samples when compared with the conventional method. pretreatment with alkaline buffers with ph levels ranging from 8.0 to 9.0 increased the bioluminescence intensities of cultures of e. cloacae and s. aureus. strong log-linear relationships between the bioluminescence intensities and plate counts emerged for the tested strains. furthermore, the microbial detection limit was 15 cfu in 500 ml of bottled green  tea after an 8-h incubation at 35 degrees c and an assay time of 1 h. the results showed that contaminated samples could be detected within 1 h of operation using  our improved bioluminescence assay. this method could be used to test for contamination during the manufacturing process as well as for statistical sampling for quality control.

TI  == [the genotype and epidemiological feature of the enterobacteriaceae carrying carbapenemase in china].
AB  == objective: to analyze the genotype and molecular epidemiology of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae. method: a total of 201 carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae were isolated from 14 hospitals in 11 cities. the mics of 14 antimicrobial drugs were detected using agar dilution method. phenotypes of carbapenemase were screened using modified hodge test and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (edta) test. drug resistance genes were screened using pcr method. the strains carrying carbapenem resistance genes were  confirmed by conjugation test. homology analysis was carried out using pulsed-field gel electro-phoresis (pfge) method and the epidemiological correlation is analyzed based on the multilocus sequence typing (mlst) method in  order to study the molecular epidemiology of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae. results: fifty-three strains among 201 carbapenem-insensitive enterobacteriaceae were detected positive carbapenem-resistant genes, among which included 33 klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 citrobacter freundii, 6 escherichia coli and 5 enterobacter cloacae. among the 53 strains, 43 were from beijing, 6 strains from hangzhou, 3 strains from nanjing and one from fuzhou. resistance genes-harboring plasmids were successfully transferred from 28 of 53 strains to escherichia coli ec600. the pfge spectrum showed that 33 klebsiella pneumoniae were classified into three types, 9 citrobacter freundii classified into four types, 5 enterobacter cloacae classified into four types, while 6 escherichia coli were the same type. based on the results of mlst test, 29 klebsiella pneumoniae strains producing kpc-2 type carbapenemase were all st11, while among  the four klebsiella pneumonia carrying imp-4 carbapenem resistant gene, three strains were st876, one was st147. conclusions: carbapenem-resistant genes were detected only in hospitals from beijing, hangzhou, nanjing and fuzhou, and type kpc-2 was the most common, followed by imp-4 and imp-8. high homology of resistant strains could be related to horizontal transfer of carbapenemase genes, which should cause great concern.

AB  == escherichia coli is the most common bacterial cause of urinary tract infections.  its rapid and specific identification in urine samples represents a major challenge within the rendering results and optimizing the management of the patient. we aimed to compare the sensitivity and specificity of two commercially  available chromogenic media for e. coli: chromid cps (biomerieux) and uriselect4  (bio(-)rad), without carrying out further tests. 99 consecutive and non-redundant urine samples considered to be infected were simultaneously plated onto blood agar and the two chromogenic media. colony color and bacterial growth quantification were compared 18 and 48 hours after incubation. bacteria were identified with mass spectrometry. a complementary analysis on 80 bacterial strains known to pose potential identification problems was performed. 43 urines  samples grew e. coli, and 42 of them were pink-colored on the two chromogenic mediums, as expected (sensibility=97.7%). growth quantification was significantly greater on blood agar than on chromogenic media (p<0.001).we noted specificity issues at the complementary analysis with the uriselect4 medium: citrobacter freundii and some strains of citrobacter brakii, enterobacter cloacae and hafnia  alvei were pink-colored, and could be misidentified as e. coli. chromid cps medium did not show such misidentification. in conclusion, the agar chromid cps proved to be greater than the uriselect4 agar in our work in terms of specificity of direct identification of e. coli, without the use of additional test.

TI  == understanding the broad substrate repertoire of nitroreductase based on its kinetic mechanism.
AB  == the oxygen-insensitive nitroreductase from enterobacter cloacae (nr) catalyzes two-electron reduction of nitroaromatics to the corresponding nitroso compounds and, subsequently, to hydroxylamine products. nr has an unusually broad substrate repertoire, which may be related to protein dynamics (flexibility) and/or a simple non-selective kinetic mechanism. to investigate the possible role of mechanism in the broad substrate repertoire of nr, the kinetics of oxidation of nr by para-nitrobenzoic acid (p-nba) were investigated using stopped-flow techniques at 4 degrees c. the results revealed a hyperbolic dependence on the p-nba concentration with a limiting rate of 1.90 +/- 0.09 s(-1), indicating one-step binding before the flavin oxidation step. there is no evidence for a distinct binding step in which specificity might be enforced. the reduction of p-nba is rate-limiting in steady-state turnover (1.7 +/- 0.3 s(-1)). the pre-steady-state reduction kinetics of nr by nadh indicate that nadh reduces the  enzyme with a rate constant of 700 +/- 20 s(-1) and a dissociation constant of 0.51 +/- 0.04 mm. thus, we demonstrate simple transient kinetics in both the reductive and oxidative half-reactions that help to explain the broad substrate repertoire of nr. finally, we tested the ability of nr to reduce para-hydroxylaminobenzoic acid, demonstrating that the corresponding amine does not accumulate to significant levels even under anaerobic conditions. thus e. cloacae nr is not a good candidate for enzymatic production of aromatic amines.

TI  == cdia from enterobacter cloacae delivers a toxic ribosomal rnase into target bacteria.
AB  == contact-dependent growth inhibition (cdi) is one mechanism of inter-bacterial competition. cdi(+) cells export large cdia effector proteins, which carry a variety of c-terminal toxin domains (cdia-ct). cdia-ct toxins are specifically neutralized by cognate cdii immunity proteins to protect toxin-producing cells from autoinhibition. here, we use structure determination to elucidate the activity of a cdi toxin from enterobacter cloacae (ecl). the structure of cdia-ct(ecl) resembles the c-terminal nuclease domain of colicin e3, which cleaves 16s ribosomal rna to disrupt protein synthesis. in accord with this structural homology, we show that cdia-ct(ecl) uses the same nuclease activity to inhibit bacterial growth. surprisingly, although colicin e3 and cdia(ecl) carry equivalent toxin domains, the corresponding immunity proteins are unrelated in sequence, structure, and toxin-binding site. together, these findings reveal unexpected diversity among 16s rrnases and suggest that these nucleases are robust and versatile payloads for a variety of toxin-delivery platforms.

TI  == enterobacteriaceae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and quinolones in fresh culinary herbs imported from southeast asia.
AB  == since multidrug resistant bacteria are frequently reported from southeast asia, our study focused on the occurrence of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae in fresh imported herbs from thailand, vietnam and malaysia. samples were collected from fresh culinary herbs imported from southeast asia in which esbl-suspected isolates were obtained by selective culturing. analysis included identification by maldi-tof mass spectrometry, susceptibility testing, xbai-pfge, microarray, pcr and sequencing of specific esbl genes, pcr based replicon typing (pbrt) of plasmids and southern blot hybridization. in addition, the quinolone resistance genotype was characterized by screening for plasmid mediated quinolone resistance (pmqr) genes and mutations in the quinolone resistance determining region (qrdr)  of gyra and parc. the study encompassed fifty samples of ten batches of culinary  herbs (5 samples per batch) comprising nine different herb variants. the herbs originated from thailand (water morning glory, acacia and betel leaf), vietnam (parsley, asian pennywort, houttuynia leaf and mint) and malaysia (holy basil and parsley). by selective culturing 21 cefotaxime resistant enterobacteriaceae were  retrieved. array analysis revealed 18 isolates with esbl genes and one isolate with solely non-esbl beta-lactamase genes. mutations in the ampc promoter region  were determined in two isolates with pcr and sequencing. the isolates were identified as klebsiella pneumoniae (n=9), escherichia coli (n=6), enterobacter cloacae complex (n=5) and enterobacter spp. (n=1). all isolates tested were multidrug resistant. variants of ctx-m enzymes were predominantly found followed  by shv enzymes. pmqr genes (including aac(6')-1b-cr, qnrb and qnrs) were also frequently detected. in almost all cases esbl and quinolone resistance genes were located on the same plasmid. imported fresh culinary herbs from southeast asia are a potential source for contamination of food with multidrug resistant bacteria. because these herbs are consumed without appropriate heating, transfer  to human bacteria cannot be excluded.

TI  == systematic metabolic engineering of escherichia coli for high-yield production of fuel bio-chemical 2,3-butanediol.
AB  == the production of biofuels by recombinant escherichia coli is restricted by the toxicity of the products. 2,3-butanediol (2,3-bd), a platform and fuel bio-chemical with low toxicity to microbes, could be a promising alternative for  biofuel production. however, the yield and productivity of 2,3-bd produced by recombinant e. coli strains are not sufficient for industrial scale fermentation. in this work, the production of 2,3-bd by recombinant e. coli strains was optimized by applying a systematic approach. 2,3-bd biosynthesis gene clusters were cloned from several native 2,3-bd producers, including bacillus subtilis, bacillus licheniformis, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and enterobacter cloacae, inserted into the expression vector pet28a, and compared for 2,3-bd synthesis. the recombinant strain e. coli bl21/petpt7-ecabc, carrying  the 2,3-bd pathway gene cluster from enterobacter cloacae, showed the best ability to synthesize 2,3-bd. thereafter, expression of the most efficient gene cluster was optimized by using different promoters, including pt7, ptac, pc, and  pabc. e. coli bl21/pet-rabc with pabc as promoter was superior in 2,3-bd synthesis. on the basis of the results of biomass and extracellular metabolite profiling analyses, fermentation conditions, including ph, agitation speed, and aeration rate, were optimized for the efficient production of 2,3-bd. after fed-batch fermentation under the optimized conditions, 73.8g/l of 2,3-bd was produced by using e. coli bl21/pet-rabc within 62h. the values of both yield and  productivity of 2,3-bd obtained with the optimized biological system are the highest ever achieved with an engineered e. coli strain. in addition to the 2,3-bd production, the systematic approach might also be used in the production of other important chemicals through recombinant e. coli strains.

AB  == the prevalence of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) in our hospital increased beginning in 2009. we aimed to study the clinical and molecular epidemiology of these emerging isolates. we performed a retrospective review of all adult patients with clinical cultures confirmed as cpe by positive  modified hodge test from 5/2009- 5/2010 at the university of michigan health system (umhs). clinical information was obtained from electronic medical records. available cpe isolates were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and sequencing of the 16s rrna encoding gene and bla kpc locus. multilocus sequence typing (mlst) was used to characterize klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. twenty six unique cpe isolates were obtained from 25 adult patients. the majority were klebsiella pneumoniae (n=17). other isolates included k. oxytoca (n=3), citrobacter freundii (n=2), enterobacter cloacae (n=2), enterobacter aerogenes (n=1) and escherichia coli (n=1). molecular characterization of 19 available cpe  isolates showed that 13 (68%) carried the kpc-3 allele and 6 (32%) carried the kpc-2 allele. among 14 available k. pneumoniae strains, 12 (86%) carried the kpc-3 allele and belonged to a common lineage, sequence type (st) 258. the other  2 (14%) k. pneumoniae isolates carried the kpc-2 allele and belonged to two unique sts. among these st 258 strains, 67% were isolated from patients with prior exposures to health care settings outside of our institution. in contrast,  all cpe isolates carrying the kpc-2 allele and all non st 258 cpe isolates had acquisition attributable to our hospital. molecular epidemiology of carbapenemase producing k. pneumoniae suggests that kpc-3 producing k. pneumoniae isolates of a common lineage, sequence type (st 258), are emerging in our hospital. while st 258 is a dominant sequence type throughout the united states, this study is the first to report its presence in michigan.

TI  == effect of proton pump inhibitors on in vitro activity of tigecycline against several common clinical pathogens.
AB  == in this study, we evaluated the effect of proton pump inhibitors (ppis) on in vitro antimicrobial activity of tigecycline against several species of clinical pathogens. clinical non-duplicate isolates of acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and three species of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia and enterobacter cloacae) were collected from a tertiary hospital and their mics of tigecycline alone and in combination with ppis (omeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole) were determined. with one randomly selected isolate of each bacterial species, an in vitro time-kill study was performed for the confirmation of the effect of ppis on tigecycline activity. the mic changes after ppis addition correlated with the  ppis concentrations in the test media. compared with tigecycline alone, the addition of 5 mg/l ppis could increase the mics of tigecycline by 0 to 2-fold and the addition of 50 mg/l ppis could increase the mics of tigecycline by 4 to >128-fold. the time-kill study confirmed that the addition of ppis could affect the in vitro activity of tigecycline. even at low concentration (5 mg/l) of omeprazole and pantoprazole, antagonistic effect could be observed in e. cloacae  and e. faecalis strains. we conclude that in vitro activity of tigecycline can be influenced by the presence of ppis in a concentration-dependent manner.

TI  == characterization of kpc-2-producing escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and klebsiella oxytoca isolates from a chinese hospital.
AB  == twelve nonduplicated kpc-2-producing enterobacterial isolates, including three escherichia coli, two citrobacter freundii, two enterobacter cloacae, four enterobacter aerogenes, and one klebsiella oxytoca, were collected from various clinical samples within 18 months (march 2011 to september 2012). two of the 12 patients died from infections caused by kpc-2-producing pathogens, while the rest of the patients with kpc-2-producing pathogens improved or were cured. the majority of the clinical isolates exhibited a high-level of resistance to oxyimino-cephalosporins and carbapenems, and possessed self-transferable bla(kpc-2)-carrying plasmids with sizes ranging from 20 to 120 kb. most isolates  carried bla(ctx-m) and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, while some isolates produced 16s rrna methylases (arma or rmtb). the genetic environment of  bla(kpc-2) of most clinical strains was consistent with the genetic structure surrounding bla(kpc-2) on the plasmid pkp048, which contains an integration structure of a tn3-based transposon and partial tn4401 segment. inserted fragments (truncated bla(tem)) were detected upstream of the bla(kpc-2) gene for  two e. aerogenes strains. in conclusion, the enterobacterial isolates exhibited sporadic emergence and did not arise by clonal spread at our hospital. the outcome of infections caused by kpc-producing enterobacterial isolates and their  mortality were closely associated with the baseline condition of patients. the spread of bla(kpc-2) gene between different enterobacterial species in china was  mainly mediated by horizontal transfer of the tn3-based transposons and not the bla(kpc-2)-carrying plasmids.

TI  == in vitro activity of colistin sulfate against enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  == the widespread multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae pose a serious therapeutic  challenge. colistin and tigecycline are potential antimicrobial agents for treating infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae. we evaluated the in-vitro activity of colistin sulfate against 253 esbl producers isolated from patients admitted to a medical center in southern taiwan (escherichia coli, n = 82; klebsiella pneumoniae, n = 102; enterobacter cloacae, n = 34; and serratia marcescens, n = 35). colistin showed promising in-vitro activity against e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae, but not s. marcescens. one esbl-producing k. pneumoniae strain with resistance to carbapenems (ertapenem, imipenem, and meropenem) was selected for time-killing studies. a combination of colistin and tigecycline showed synergism, but there was an inoculum effect. in conclusion, colistin was active against most esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae, and a combination of colistin with tigecycline was synergistic against some highly resistant strains, even those with carbapenem resistance.

TI  == risk factors associated with preoperative fecal carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in liver transplant recipients.
AB  == objective: the aim of the study was to identify risk factors associated with pre-transplant fecal carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae in liver transplant recipients. patients and  methods: over a 3-year period (january 2009-december 2011), 317 patients who underwent liver transplantation were screened preoperatively for fecal carriage of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae. risk factors for fecal carriage were investigated by univariate analysis and stepwise logistic regression. results: of the 317 patients screened, 50 (15.7%) harbored an esbl-producing isolate. previous infection with an esbl-producing organism had developed during the last  6 months in 20% of fecal carriers versus in none of the non-carriers. other variables associated with fecal carriage were a model for end-stage liver disease score >/=25, pre-transplant stay in the intensive care unit >/=48 h, hospital stay >/=10 days in the last 6 months, a history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (sbp), exposure to a beta-lactam agent in the last month, and prophylaxis with norfloxacin. independent predictors of fecal carriage in the multivariate logistic regression model were exposure to a beta-lactam agent in the month preceding transplantation (odds ratio [or] = 7.8, confidence interval [ci] = 4-15.5, p < 0.001), and a history of sbp (or = 2.4, ci = 1.1-4.9, p = 0.02). conclusions: previous infection with an esbl-producing isolate, recent exposure to a beta-lactam agent, and a history of sbp are risk factors for preoperative fecal carriage of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae in liver transplant recipients. patients at risk of fecal carriage should receive intraoperative prophylaxis and, when necessary, empiric postoperative antimicrobial treatment that includes coverage for these organisms.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of geranium oil against gram-negative bacteria isolated from difficult-to-heal wounds.
AB  == hard-to-heal wounds represent a significant problem to patients, health care professionals, and health care system. they can be formed as a result of mechanical injuries and burns, and any co-existing chronic disease increases the  risk of their emergence. diabetics are at a greater risk of developing chronic wounds because of poor circulation, slow healing times, vascular disease and neuropathy. the aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of  geranium oil against gram-negative bacterial clinical strains. clinical strains were isolated from patients with difficult-to-treat wounds and a comprehensive evaluation of their sensitivity to antibiotics was carried out. the constituents  of geranium oil were specified by gc-fid-ms analysis. the micro-dilution broth method was used to check the inhibition of microbial growth at various concentrations of geranium oil. the tested geranium oil was efficacious against gram-negative pathogens responsible for problems with wound treatment. the results suggest that geranium oil may be considered an effective component of therapy in the case of frequent recurrences of infections caused by resistant pathogens.

TI  == characterization of a novel pyranopyridine inhibitor of the acrab efflux pump of  escherichia coli.
AB  == members of the resistance-nodulation-division (rnd) family of efflux pumps, such  as acrab-tolc of escherichia coli, play major roles in multidrug resistance (mdr) in gram-negative bacteria. a strategy for combating mdr is to develop efflux pump inhibitors (epis) for use in combination with an antibacterial agent. here, we describe mbx2319, a novel pyranopyridine epi with potent activity against rnd efflux pumps of the enterobacteriaceae. mbx2319 decreased the mics of ciprofloxacin (cip), levofloxacin, and piperacillin versus e. coli ab1157 by 2-,  4-, and 8-fold, respectively, but did not exhibit antibacterial activity alone and was not active against acrab-tolc-deficient strains. mbx2319 (3.13 mum) in combination with 0.016 mug/ml cip (minimally bactericidal) decreased the viability (cfu/ml) of e. coli ab1157 by 10,000-fold after 4 h of exposure, in comparison with 0.016 mug/ml cip alone. in contrast, phenyl-arginine-beta-naphthylamide (pabetan), a known epi, did not increase the bactericidal activity of 0.016 mug/ml cip at concentrations as high as 100 mum. mbx2319 increased intracellular accumulation of the fluorescent dye hoechst 33342 in wild-type but not acrab-tolc-deficient strains and did not perturb the transmembrane proton gradient. mbx2319 was broadly active against enterobacteriaceae species and pseudomonas aeruginosa. mbx2319 is a potent epi with possible utility as an adjunctive therapeutic agent for the treatment of infections caused by gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == risk factors of community-onset urinary tract infections caused by plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == background: the ampc beta-lactamase (ampc)-producing enterobacteriaceae emerged worldwide. this study was conducted to determine the risk factors of community-onset urinary tract infections (utis) caused by plasmid-mediated ampc-producing enterobacteriaceae. methods: patients who were diagnosed as community-onset utis caused by enterobacteriaceae in a tertiary-care teaching hospital from december 2010 to january 2012 were included. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing isolates were excluded. we identified plasmid-mediated ampc-producing enterobacteriaceae both phenotypically (by disk potentiation test and double-disk synergy test) and genotypically (by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay). the demographic data, clinical characteristics, and risk factors of acquisition were described. results: among the 323 non-esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae identified in community-onset utis, 50 isolates were phenotypically positive for ampc. escherichia coli was the most  common ampc-producing organism (60%), followed by klebsiella pneumonia (8%), and  enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis (6% for each species). the independent risk factors for acquisition of ampc-producing enterobacteriaceae included prior  history of cerebral vascular accident [odds ratio (or) = 2.014; 95% confidence interval (ci) = 1.007-4.031; p = 0.0048], and prior use of fluoroquinolones (or = 4.049; 95% ci = 1.759-9.319; p = 0.001) and cephamycin (or = 9.683; 95% ci = 2.007-45.135; p = 0.004). ampc-producing isolates were multidrug resistant. carbapenems, cefepime, and piperacillin/tazobactam had the best in vitro efficacy. the most commonly identified plasmid-mediated ampc gene was blacit, followed by bladha/blaebc, and blamox. conclusion: for community-onset utis, ampc-producing enterobacteriaceae should be suspected in those with prior history of cerebral vascular accident and prior use of antimicrobials. to treat these multiple-resistant isolates, carbapenems, cefepime, and piperacillin/tazobactam may be considered.

TI  == change of antibiotic susceptibility testing guidelines from clsi to eucast: influence on cumulative hospital antibiograms.
AB  == objective: we studied whether the change in antibiotic susceptibility testing (ast) guidelines from clsi to eucast influenced cumulative antibiograms in a tertiary care hospital in switzerland. methods: antibiotic susceptibilities of non-duplicate isolates collected within a one-year period before (period a) and after (period b) changing ast interpretation from clsi 2009 to eucast 1.3 (2011)  guidelines were analysed. in addition, period b isolates were reinterpreted according to the clsi 2009, clsi 2013 and eucast 3.1 (2013) guidelines. results:  the majority of species/drug combinations showed no differences in susceptibility rates comparing periods a and b. however, in some gram-negative bacilli, decreased susceptibility rates were observed when comparing clsi 2009 with eucast 1.3 within period b: escherichia coli / cefepime, 95.8% (clsi 2009) vs. 93.1% (eucast 1.3), p=0.005; enterobacter cloacae / cefepime, 97.0 (clsi 2009) vs. 90.5% (eucast 1.3), p=0.012; pseudomonas aeruginosa / meropenem, 88.1% (clsi 2009) vs. 78.3% (eucast 1.3), p=0.002. these differences were still evident when  comparing susceptibility rates according to the clsi 2013 guideline with eucast 3.1 guideline. for p. aeruginosa and imipenem, a trend towards a lower antibiotic susceptibility rate in icus compared to general wards turned into a significant difference after the change to eucast: 87.9% vs. 79.8%, p=0.08 (clsi 2009) and 86.3% vs. 76.8%, p=0.048 (eucast 1.3). conclusions: the change of ast guidelines  from clsi to eucast led to a clinically relevant decrease of susceptibility rates in cumulative antibiograms for defined species/drug combinations, particularly in those with considerable differences in clinical susceptibility breakpoints between the two guidelines.

TI  == discordance in the minimal inhibitory concentrations of ertapenem for enterobacter cloacae: vitek 2 system versus etest and agar dilution methods.
AB  == our objective was to compare the ertapenem minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) for enterobacter cloacae isolates categorized intermediate or resistant to ertapenem when measured with the vitek 2 system, with the mics for these isolates when measured by two methods performed in agar medium: the etest and agar plate dilution method (apdm). overall, 50 e. cloacae isolates were included in the study. the mean mic of ertapenem was 2.92+/-1.77mug/ml according to the vitek 2 system, 0.94+/-0.84mug/ml according to the etest strips, and 0.93+/-0.62mug/ml according to the apdm. furthermore, the mics determined by the vitek 2 system were higher than the mics determined by the two other methods for 96% of strains. lastly, according to the etest strips and apdm, 42% of e. cloacae were susceptible to ertapenem. no carbapenemase was identified by the screening method used. using the vitek 2 system to determine ertapenem mics for e. cloacae can have potential consequences in terms of additional carbapenemase-detecting tests  and antimicrobial therapy. it would be interesting to determine if the vitek 2 system is more effective for the detection of carbapenemase producers with low-level carbapenem resistance than the two methods performed in agar medium.

TI  == an analog of the host-defense peptide hymenochirin-1b with potent broad-spectrum  activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria and immunomodulatory properties.
AB  == hymenochirin-1b (iklspetkdn(10)lkkvlkgaik(20)gaiavakmv.nh2) is a cationic, amphipathic, alpha-helical, host-defense peptide, first isolated from skin secretions of the congo clawed frog hymenochirus boettgeri (pipidae). structure-activity relationships were investigated by synthesizing analogs in which the pro(5), glu(6) and asp(9) on the hydrophilic face of the alpha-helix are substituted by one or more l-lysine or d-lysine residues. although replacement with l-lysine generates analogs with increased antimicrobial potency  against a range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (up to 8-fold), the peptides are more hemolytic. increasing the cationicity of hymenochirin-1b while  reducing the helicity by substitutions with d-lysine generates analogs that are between 2 and 8 fold more potent than the native peptide and are equally or less  hemolytic. [e6k,d9k]hymenochirin-1b represents a candidate for drug development as it shows high potency against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and a range of gram-negative bacteria, including multidrug-resistant strains of acinetobacter baumannii and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic in the range 0.8-3.1 mum) and ndm-1 carbapenemase-producing clinical isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii (mic in the range 3.1-6.25 mum), and low hemolytic activity (lc50=302 mum). [e6k,d9k]hymenochirin-1b, at a concentration of 2.5 mum, significantly (p<0.05) stimulates the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokines il-4 and il-10 by human peripheral blood mononuclear  cells but is without significant effect on production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tnf-alpha and il-17.

AB  == a series of 70 new 3,3'(alpha,omega-dioxaalkyl)bis(1-alkylimidazolium) chlorides  were synthesized. they were characterized with respect to surface active properties and antimicrobial activity against the following pathogens: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida krusei, and candida albicans. in this article, besides description of the synthesis, we characterize a set of features of these compounds, concerning their structure (described by the length of the dioxaalkan  spacer and the length of the alkyl substituent in the aromatic ring) and surface  active properties (critical micelle concentration, value of surface tension at critical micelle concentration, value of surface excess, molecular area of a single particle, and free energy of adsorption of molecule). then, we present a sar study for staphylococcus aureus, as one of the most widespread pathogenic strains, conducted with the help of the dominance-based rough set approach (drsa), that involves identification of relevant features and relevant combinations of features being in strong relationship with a high antimicrobial activity of the compounds. the sar study shows, moreover, that the antimicrobial  activity is dependent on the type of substituents and their position at the chloride moiety, as well as on the surface active properties of the compounds.

TI  == development of indole-3-acetic acid-producing escherichia coli by functional expression of ipdc, aspc, and iad1.
AB  == biosynthesis of indole-3-acetic acid (iaa) via the indole-3-pyruvic acid pathway  involves three kinds of enzymes; aminotransferase encoded by aspc, indole-3-pyruvic acid decarboxylase encoded by ipdc, and indole-3-acetic acid dehydrogenase encoded by iad1. the ipdc from enterobacter cloacae atcc 13047, aspc from escherichia coli, and iad1 from ustilago maydis were cloned and expressed under the control of the tac and sod promoters in e. coli. according to sds-page and enzyme activity, ipdc and iad1 showed good expression under the control of p(tac), whereas aspc was efficiently expressed by p(sod) originating from corynebacterium glutamicum. the activities of ipdc, aspc, and iad1 from the  crude extracts of recombinant e. coli top 10 were 215.6, 5.7, and 272.1 nmol/min/mg-protein, respectively. the recombinant e. coli dh5alpha expressing ipdc, aspc, and iad1 produced about 1.1 g/l of iaa and 0.13 g/l of tryptophol (tol) after 48 h of cultivation in lb medium with 2 g/l tryptophan. to improve iaa production, a tnaa gene mediating indole formation from tryptophan was deleted. as a result, e. coli iaa68 with expression of the three genes produced 1.8 g/l of iaa, which is a 1.6- fold increase compared with wild-type dh5alpha harboring the same plasmids. moreover, the complete conversion of tryptophan to iaa was achieved by e. coli iaa68. finally, e. coli iaa68 produced 3.0 g/l of iaa after 24 h cultivation in lb medium supplemented with 4 g/l of tryptophan.

TI  == in vivo efficacy of humanized ceftaroline fosamil-avibactam exposures in a polymicrobial infection model.
AB  == although gram-positive cocci are the most common pathogens in diabetic foot infections, these infections often are polymicrobial. the objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of a simulated human dose of 600 mg ceftaroline fosamil-600 mg avibactam every 8 h as a 1-h infusion in a polymicrobial in vivo murine model. seven isolates were used (3 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus [mrsa] isolates, 1 methicillin-susceptible s. aureus [mssa] isolate, 1 escherichia coli isolate, 1 enterobacter cloacae isolate, and 1 bacteroides fragilis isolate) in various combinations in an immunocompromised polymicrobial tissue infection to assess the efficacy of the simulated regimen. each infection  was comprised of at least one s. aureus isolate with a mic of 0.25 to 1 mug/ml and one enterobacteriaceae isolate with a mic of 1 or 4 mug/ml. eight of 16 infections also included b. fragilis, with a mic of 0.5 mug/ml, as a third organism. efficacy was evaluated after 24 h as the change in log10 cfu from the level of 0-h controls. efficacy was seen against all isolate combinations, with at least a 1-log kill against enterobacteriaceae and a minimum of a 2-log kill against s. aureus and b. fragilis isolates. these bacterial reductions correlate  with free drug concentration above the mic (ft>mic) produced by the humanized regimen of 100, 86, and 56% at mics of 1, 2, and 4 mug/ml, respectively. the humanized regimen of 600 mg ceftaroline fosamil-600 mg avibactam every 8 h as a 1-h infusion showed predictable efficacy against all infections tested in this model. these data support further clinical investigation of ceftaroline fosamil-avibactam for the treatment of polymicrobial tissue infections.

TI  == susceptibility of gram-negative aerobic bacilli from intra-abdominal pathogens to antimicrobial agents collected in the united states during 2011.
AB  == objectives: during 2011, a total of 1442 gram-negative pathogens from intra-abdominal infections were collected as part of the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart) from 19 hospital sites within the united  states. susceptibility to ertapenem and comparators and molecular analysis of ertapenem resistant isolates was performed. methods: extended-spectrum beta-lactamase esbl (esbl) isolates were determined using the clinical and laboratory standards institute's recommended phenotypic test. isolates were identified to the species level, and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using custom microscan dehydrated broth microdilution panels esbls and carbapenemases were characterized using the check-points microarray. strain typing of klebsiella pneumoniae was performed by rep-pcr on the diversilab system. results: the majority of isolates were escherichia coli (36%), k. pneumoniae (18.6%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%) and enterobacter cloacae (8.4%). incidence of esbl-positive isolates was 12.7%, 9.7%, 3.6% and 3.1% for k. pneumoniae, e. coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella oxytoca, respectively. against the majority of isolates and species tested, the most active antibiotics  were amikacin, ertapenem, and imipenem, with the carbapenems being the most active in vitro, including against esbl-positive isolates of e. coli. all other antibiotics exhibited diminished activity. against k. pneumoniae, the carbapenems were notably less active against esbl-positive isolates though their activity against this sub-population was still the highest of all antibiotics tested; however, 41.1% (14 of 34) of the phenotypically esbl-positive k. pneumoniae co-produced a carbapenemase (kpc2 or kpc3), and >90% of the isolates producing only an esbl remained susceptible to ertapenem. conclusions: further monitoring of susceptibility of intra-abdominal isolates is warranted due to limited therapeutic options available to physicians.

TI  == wound healing and antibacterial activities of chondroitin sulfate- and acharan sulfate-reduced silver nanoparticles.
AB  == for topical applications in wound healing, silver nanoparticles (agnps) have attracted much attention as antibacterial agents. herein, we describe a green-synthetic route for the production of biocompatible and crystalline agnps using two glycosaminoglycans, chondroitin sulfate (cs) and acharan sulfate (as),  as reducing agents. the synthetic approach avoids the use of toxic chemicals, and the yield of agnps formation is found to be 98.1% and 91.1% for the chondroitin sulfate-reduced silver nanoparticles (cs-agnps) and the acharan sulfate-reduced silver nanoparticles (as-agnps), respectively. nanoparticles with mostly spherical and amorphous shapes were observed, with an average diameter of 6.16 +/- 2.26 nm for cs-agnps and 5.79 +/- 3.10 nm for as-agnps. images of the cs-agnps obtained from atomic force microscopy revealed the self-assembled structure of cs was similar to a densely packed woven mat with agnps sprinkled on the cs. these nanoparticles were stable under cell culture conditions without any noticeable aggregation. an approximately 128-fold enhancement of the antibacterial activities of the agnps was observed against enterobacter cloacae and escherichia coli when compared to cs and as alone. in addition, an in vivo animal model of wound healing activity was tested using mice that were subjected  to deep incision wounds. in comparison to the controls, the ointments containing  cs-agnps and as-agnps stimulated wound closure under histological examination and accelerated the deposition of granulation tissue and collagen in the wound area.  the wound healing activity of the ointments containing cs-agnps and as-agnps are  comparable to that of a commercial formulation of silver sulfadiazine even though the newly prepared ointments contain a lower silver concentration. therefore, the newly prepared agnps demonstrate potential for use as an attractive biocompatible nanocomposite for topical applications in the treatment of wounds.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the canward surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 canadian hospitals from january 2010 to december 2012. in total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method (document m07-a9, 2012), with mics interpreted by using clsi breakpoints (document m100-s23, 2013). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (mic90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, c. freundii, and h. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to clsi mic interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (p. mirabilis) to 54.0% (s. marcescens). all isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (mic90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity  against staphylococci or streptococci. all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.03 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and streptococcus agalactiae (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. we conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to  third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing e. coli and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == culture proven newborn sepsis with a special emphasis on late onset sepsis caused by enterobacteriaceae in a level iii neonatal care unit in astana, kazakhstan.
AB  == background: newborn sepsis is one of the major public health concerns worldwide.  also in our neonatal care unit, it is one of the major problems and especially infections with enterobacteriaceae were noted to pose an increasing problem in the last years. methods: data collection was done retrospectively for 2011. early onset sepsis was defined as having a positive blood culture within 72 h and late  onset sepsis after 72 h of delivery. results: out of 599 patients being admitted, 58 newborns were assessed having a neonatal sepsis. of these 58 newborns with sepsis, 11 were diagnosed within 72 h post delivery (early onset) and 47 were diagnosed after 72 h post delivery (late onset). the percentage of enterobacteriaceae causing late onset sepsis was 57.5 %. among these, klebsiella  pneumoniae could be isolated in 29.8 %, enterobacter cloacae in 12.8 %, enterobacter aerogenes in 8.5 %, and escherichia coli in 6.4 % of late onset sepsis. majority of the strains showed a resistance to antibiotics used in empiric treatment. antibiotic prophylaxis/treatment from birth until the onset of late onset sepsis could be analyzed in 20 out of 27 newborns with late onset sepsis caused by enterobacteriaceae. a regimen of empirical antibiotic treatment  containing aminopenicillin and/or gentamicin was administered in 16 newborns and  that of cephalosporin in 14 out of 20 newborns for at least 5 days before onset of sepsis. conclusions: the association of empiric long-term antibiotic treatment and the high number of late onset sepsis with often multiresistant enterobacteriaceae might be causal and urges for a change in general antibiotic prophylaxis/treatment in newborns admitted to the neonatal care unit of our hospital.

AB  == background: the data on susceptibility of important cephalosporins against four enterobacteriaceae members producing potential extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) collected from taiwanese intensive care units are lacking. methods: minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefepime were determined using agar dilution method, against escherichia coli (n = 344), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 359), enterobacter cloacae (n = 103), and proteus mirabilis (n = 78). susceptibilities of these isolates to three cephalosporins were assessed according to mic breakpoints recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) in 2013. the double-disk synergy test using disks containing cefepime (30 mug) with or without clavulanate (10 mug) was applied to  confirm production of esbl for isolates with cephalosporin mic >/= 2 mug/ml. results: a total of 175 isolates were verified as esbl producers. the rates of cefepime susceptibility among the esbl-producing isolates, according to clsi (eucast) criteria, were 56.7% (22.4%) for e. coli, 61.3% (12.0%) for k. pneumoniae, 57.9% (31.6%) for e. cloacae, and 71.4% (7.1%) for p. mirabilis. using different cefepime mic breakpoints (mics >/= 16 mug/ml recommended by clsi  criteria and >/= 2 mug/ml by eucast criteria) to define nonsusceptibility, we found that both criteria were poorer at predicting esbl producers among k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae than among the other two species. in addition, we also  found that the cefepime mic level of 1.0 mug/ml best distinguished non-esbl- from esbl-producing k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae. conclusion: to detect esbls, clsi should revise the cefepime mic breakpoint against enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == rapid detection of bacteria in urine samples by the "three-plug-injection" method using capillary electrophoresis.
AB  == this study explored a method that can rapidly detect bacteria in urine samples for the auxiliary determination of urinary tract infections (utis). urine samples from patients with utis (230 cases) were obtained using aseptic technique. the urine biochemical assay was then carried out using an automated urine analyzer for all the urine samples. bacterial species were identified by a combination of  bacterial culture technique, morphological observation and the bact-ist microbial identification/susceptibility analysis system. the most common seven species of bacteria in the study included escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. bacterial samples were suspended in sample buffer solutions and separated by the "three-plug-injection"  method using capillary electrophoresis (ce). each species of bacteria appeared as a bacterial peak. the mixture of the seven species also provided only one peak. further analysis showed that the concentration limit for the "three-plug-injection" method is 10(6) colony forming units (cfu)/ml, and there is a good linear relationship between the peak height and bacterial concentration (r(2)=0.99). the effect of urine composition on ce results was also investigated. the results showed that urine composition, i.e., proteins, white blood cells (wbcs) and red blood cells (rbcs), affected the peak retention time but could not affect the separation of bacteria. the results demonstrated that the bacteria in  urine samples can be detected within 10min by the "three-plug-injection" method using ce. the "three-plug-injection" method is therefore suitable for the rapid detection of organisms in clinical urine samples from utis.

TI  == resistance and inactivation kinetics of bacterial strains isolated from the non-chlorinated and chlorinated effluents of a wwtp.
AB  == the microbiological quality of water from a wastewater treatment plant that uses  sodium hypochlorite as a disinfectant was assessed. mesophilic aerobic bacteria were not removed efficiently. this fact allowed for the isolation of several bacterial strains from the effluents. molecular identification indicated that the strains were related to aeromonas hydrophila, escherichia coli (three strains), enterobacter cloacae, kluyvera cryocrescens (three strains), kluyvera intermedia, citrobacter freundii (two strains), bacillus sp. and enterobacter sp. the first five strains, which were isolated from the non-chlorinated effluent, were used to test resistance to chlorine disinfection using three sets of variables: disinfectant concentration (8, 20 and 30 mg.l(-1)), contact time (0, 15 and 30 min) and water temperature (20, 25 and 30 degrees c). the results demonstrated that the strains have independent responses to experimental conditions and that the most efficient treatment was an 8 mg.l(-1) dose of disinfectant at a temperature of 20 degrees c for 30 min. the other eight strains, which were isolated from the chlorinated effluent, were used to analyze inactivation kinetics using the disinfectant at a dose of 15 mg.l(-1) with various retention times (0, 10, 20, 30, 60 and 90 min). the results indicated that during the inactivation process, there was no relationship between removal percentage and retention time and that the strains have no common response to the treatments.

AB  == avibactam is a non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor with a spectrum of activity that includes beta-lactamase enzymes of classes a, c, and selected d examples. in this work acylation and deacylation rates were measured against the  clinically important enzymes ctx-m-15, kpc-2, enterobacter cloacae ampc, pseudomonas aeruginosa ampc, oxa-10, and oxa-48. the efficiency of acylation (k2/ki) varied across the enzyme spectrum, from 1.1 x 10(1) m(-1)s(-1) for oxa-10 to 1.0 x 10(5) for ctx-m-15. inhibition of oxa-10 was shown to follow the covalent reversible mechanism, and the acylated oxa-10 displayed the longest residence time for deacylation, with a half-life of greater than 5 days. across multiple enzymes, acyl enzyme stability was assessed by mass spectrometry. these  inhibited enzyme forms were stable to rearrangement or hydrolysis, with the exception of kpc-2. kpc-2 displayed a slow hydrolytic route that involved fragmentation of the acyl-avibactam complex. the identity of released degradation products was investigated, and a possible mechanism for the slow deacylation from kpc-2 is proposed.

AB  == from august 2008 to december 2011, six metallo-beta-lactamase-producing isolates, four enterobacter cloacae, one klebsiella oxytoca and one citrobacter freundii, were detected at hospital interzonal general de agudos "evita" in lanus. all six  isolates showed multiresistant profiles and the presence of the blaimp-8 gene. five isolates also expressed per-2 extended spectrum beta-lactamase. the blaimp-8 gene was found as the first cassette in a class 1 integron. however, the 3 conserved sequence could not be detected in three isolates. in all cases, blaimp-8 was transferred by conjugation to azide-resistant escherichia coli j53.  pfge analysis revealed that the four e. cloacae isolates were not genetically related. these are the first metallo-beta-lactamases detected in this institution and our results suggest a possible intra- and inter-species horizontal dissemination of blaimp-8.

TI  == detection of the common resistance genes in gram-negative bacteria using gene chip technology.
AB  == objective: to design a resistance gene detection chip that could, in parallel, detect common clinical drug resistance genes of gram-negative bacteria. materials and methods: seventy clinically significant gram-negative bacilli (klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii) were collected. according to the known resistance gene sequences, we designed and synthesized primers and probes, which were used to prepare resistance gene detection chips, and finally we hybridized and scanned the gene detection chips. results: the results between the gene chip and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) were compared. the rate was consistently 100% in  the eight kinds of resistance genes tested (tem, shv, ctx-m, dha, cit, vim, kpc,  oxa-23). one strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa had the imp, but it was not found by gene chip. conclusion: the design of gram-negative bacteria-resistant gene detection chip had better application value.

TI  == rapid bacterial whole-genome sequencing to enhance diagnostic and public health microbiology.
AB  == importance: the latest generation of benchtop dna sequencing platforms can provide an accurate whole-genome sequence (wgs) for a broad range of bacteria in  less than a day. these could be used to more effectively contain the spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens. objective: to compare wgs with standard clinical microbiology practice for the investigation of nosocomial outbreaks caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, the identification of genetic determinants of antimicrobial resistance, and typing of other clinically important pathogens. design, setting, and participants: a laboratory-based study of hospital inpatients with a range of bacterial infections at cambridge university hospitals nhs foundation trust, a secondary and tertiary referral center in england, comparing wgs with standard diagnostic microbiology using stored bacterial isolates and clinical information. main outcomes and measures: specimens were taken and processed as part of routine clinical care, and cultured isolates stored and referred for additional reference laboratory testing as necessary. isolates underwent dna extraction and library preparation prior to sequencing on  the illumina miseq platform. bioinformatic analyses were performed by persons blinded to the clinical, epidemiologic, and antimicrobial susceptibility data. results: we investigated 2 putative nosocomial outbreaks, one caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and the other by carbapenem-resistant enterobacter cloacae; wgs accurately discriminated between outbreak and nonoutbreak isolates and was superior to conventional typing methods. we compared wgs with standard methods for the identification of the mechanism of carbapenem resistance in a range of gram-negative bacteria (acinetobacter baumannii, e cloacae, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae). this demonstrated concordance between phenotypic and genotypic results, and the ability to determine whether resistance was attributable to the presence of carbapenemases or other resistance mechanisms. whole-genome sequencing was used to recapitulate  reference laboratory typing of clinical isolates of neisseria meningitidis and to provide extended phylogenetic analyses of these. conclusions and relevance: the speed, accuracy, and depth of information provided by wgs platforms to confirm or refute outbreaks in hospitals and the community, and to accurately define transmission of multidrug-resistant and other organisms, represents an important  advance.

TI  == purification and characterization of a gh43 beta-xylosidase from enterobacter sp. identified and cloned from forest soil bacteria.
AB  == the use of lignocellulosic biomass for second generation biofuels requires optimization of enzymatic breakdown of plant cell walls. in this work, cellulolytic bacteria were isolated from a native and two cultivated forest soil  samples. amplification of glycosyl hydrolases was attempted by using a low stringency-degenerate primer pcr strategy, using total soil dna and bulk dna pooled from positive colonies as template. a set of primers was designed based on acidothermus cellulolyticus genome, by search of conserved domains of glycosyl hydrolases (gh) families of interest. using this approach, a fragment containing  an open reading frame (orf) with 98% identity to a putative gh43 beta-xylosidase  coding gene from enterobacter cloacae was amplified and cloned. the full protein  was expressed in escherichia coli as n-terminal or c-terminal his-tagged fusions  and purified under native conditions. only n-terminal fusion protein, his-xyl43,  presented beta-xylosidase activity. on pnpx, optimal activity was achieved at ph  6 and 40 degrees c and km and kcat values were 2.92 mm and 1.32 seg(-1), respectively. activity was also demonstrated on xylobiose (x2), with km 17.8 mm and kcat 380 s(-1). these results demonstrated that xyl43 is a functional beta-xylosidase and it is the first evidence of this activity for enterobacter sp.

TI  == internalisation potential of escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus in lettuce seedlings and mature plants.
AB  == the internalisation potential of listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium in lettuce was evaluated using seedlings grown in vermiculite in seedling trays as well as hydroponically grown lettuce. sterile distilled water was spiked with one of the four human pathogenic bacteria (10(5) cfu/ml) and used to irrigate the plants. the potential for pathogen internalisation was investigated over time using light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and viable plate counts. additionally, the identities of the pathogens isolated from internal lettuce plant tissues were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction with pathogen-specific oligonucleotides. internalisation of each of the  human pathogens was evident in both lettuce seedlings and hydroponically grown mature lettuce plants. to our knowledge, this is the first report of s. aureus internalisation in lettuce plants. in addition, the levels of background microflora in the lettuce plants were determined by plate counting and the isolates identified using matrix-assisted laser ionisation-time of flight (maldi-tof). background microflora assessments confirmed the absence of the four  pathogens evaluated in this study. a low titre of previously described endophytes and soil inhabitants, i.e., enterobacter cloacae, enterococcus faecalis, lysinibacillus fusiformis, rhodococcus rhodochrous, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus hominis were identified.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of schinus lentiscifolius (anacardiaceae).
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: schinus lentiscifolius marchand (syn. schinus weinmannifolius engl) is a plant native to rio grande do sul (southern brazil) and has been used in brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. material and methods: the crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, three gram negative bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: candida albicans, candida tropicalis, cryptococcus neoformans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two gram positive bacteria, namely, bacillus cereus, enterococcus spp, and six gram negative bacteria, namely, burkholderia cepacia, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis. results: the leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of schinus lentiscifolius showed a  broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (mic) against the tested bacteria and fungi. the n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against candida albicans (mic=25 mug/ml), candida tropicalis (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and cryptococcus neoformans, (mic=15.5 mug/ml). from the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of schinus lentiscifolius. conclusion: the antimicrobial activity and some constituents of schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. the results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.

TI  == bloodstream infections in patients with or without cancer in a large community hospital.
AB  == purpose: cancer is associated with an increased risk of acquiring bloodstream infection (bsis). most knowledge on pathogens and outcome are derived from specialised cancer centres. we here sought to compare causative micro-organisms in bsis in patients with or without cancer in a 600-bed teaching community hospital. methods: we analysed all positive blood cultures from adult patients between january 2005 and january 2011. results: a total of 4,918 episodes of bsi  occurred in 2,891 patients, of whom 13.4% had a diagnosis of cancer (85.5% with a solid tumour). in both patient groups, gram-positive isolates were more prevalent (58.7 and 61.4% in patients with and without cancer, respectively) than gram-negative isolates (31.8 and 32.3%, respectively). amongst gram-positive organisms, coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus and enterococci were the most frequently isolated in both patient groups; in cancer patients, twice as many bsis were caused by enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. amongst gram-negative organisms, escherichia coli was the most common isolate; in cancer patients, twice as many bsis were caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae. yeasts were grown from 3.0% of blood cultures from cancer patients compared to 1.5% of cultures from non-cancer patients. cancer patients had a 90-day mortality of 35.8% following bsi compared to 23.5% in patients without cancer. conclusion: these data demonstrate distinct bsi pathogens and impaired outcomes in patients with cancer in the setting of a large community teaching hospital.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to identify the mechanisms leading to carbapenem resistance among multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from hospitalized patients with nosocomial infections in mubarak al kabeer hospital, kuwait. fourteen carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae isolates were obtained from inpatients in different wards and intensive care units between april 2009 and february 2011. antibiotic susceptibilities were determined using the e-test method. genes encoding beta-lactamases were characterized by specific pcr amplification, sequencing and conjugation assays. all isolates were identified as metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl) producers using phenotypic and molecular methods. eleven of the 14 isolates produced vim-4 (six klebsiella pneumoniae, three escherichia coli, one enterobacter cloacae and one klebsiella oxytoca). three k.  pneumoniae isolates produced the mbl ndm-1 and co-produced the plasmid-encoded ampc cmy-4. the vim-4-producing isolates co-produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases including ctx-m-15 and some shv derivatives. the vim-4 gene was not transferable by conjugation studies of six selected strains. we demonstrated  here the emergence of vim-4- and ndm-1-producing isolates in the largest teaching hospital in kuwait.

AB  == bacteria producing new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (ndm-1) exhibit high level  resistance to beta-lactams including carbapenems. this broad-spectrum resistance  limits treatment options for infections caused by ndm-1 producers. ndm-1 was first isolated from an indian patient in sweden; since then, ndm-1 producing isolates have been identified in many countries including turkey. in this study,  we investigated the presence of ndm-1 by pcr method in various gram-negative isolates recovered from clinical specimens in tertiary care hospitals in samsun,  turkey. a total of 210 carbapenem-resistant gram-negative isolates (132 acinetobacter baumannii, 54 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 5 pseudomonas putida, 8 enterobacter cloacae, 3 enterobacter aerogenes, 3 klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 providencia rettgeri, 2 escherichia coli and 1 citrobacter freundii) were included in the study. identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of the isolates were performed by using vitek-2 compact (biomerieux, france) and bd  phoenix (bd diagnostic systems, md) automated systems. the results of antibiotic  susceptibility testing were interpreted according to the clsi recommendations. in our study, ndm-1 gene was not detected in any of the clinical isolates by pcr. there was only one case study that reported the presence of ndm-1 in clinical isolates from turkey [poirel l et al. antimicrob agents chemother 2012;56:2784].  our data, together with the others, indicated that the existence of ndm-1 in clinical isolates is not common in turkey. however, since ndm-1 is a plasmid-encoded enzyme, there is always a risk of spread of this resistance through the bacterial strains in our country. therefore, continuous surveillance  and investigation of carbapenem-resistant isolates with resistance patterns suggestive of ndm-1 may enable to identify ndm-1 producing isolates. meanwhile special care should be given on rational antibiotic use and establishment of appropriate infection control policies to prevent the spread of ndm-1 producers and other potential resistant strains.

AB  == among 28 clinically relevant, carbapenem non-susceptible enterobacteriaceae isolates collected in 2009-2011 in the united arab emirates three klebsiella pneumoniae, two escherichia coli, one enterobacter cloacae and one citrobacter freundi were identified to produce ndm-1 carbapenemase. unexpectedly, with the exception of a k. pneumoniae strain, sequence type st11, originally acquired in india and subsequently spread nosocomially in the uae, the majority of the strains could not be directly linked to foreign travel. all isolates harboured the blandm-1 gene on plasmids of inca/c, inchi1b and incx3 types, or were untypable. incx3 type plasmids with a mass of 50 kb and with the same or highly similar restriction patterns, with regions flanking the blandm-1 gene identical to the incx3 ndm plasmids described from china were present in three different species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli and c. freundii. our findings strongly support the assumptions that, beyond the indian subcontinent, the middle east is an important reservoir of ndm-producing organisms. furthermore, we also provide evidence that incx3 plasmids, recently implicated in the spread of blandm-1 in china, have been widely distributed and are important vehicles of the inter-species spread of the ndm-1 gene.

TI  == microbiological diagnosis and antibiotic therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia and acute copd exacerbation in daily clinical practice: comparison to current guidelines.
AB  == background: the aim of this secondary analysis was to evaluate current microbiological approaches, microbiology, and antibiotic therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (cap) and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease (aecopd) in clinical practice and to compare them with current  international guidelines. methods: a total of 362 patients with suspected cap were enrolled in 14 european centers in a prospective multicenter study. results: a total of 279 inpatients (cap, n = 222; aecopd, n = 57) were evaluated. a total  of 83 (37 %) cap patients and 25 (44 %) aecopd patients did not undergo any microbiological tests. in patients with cap/aecopd, blood culture was performed in 109 (49 %)/16 (28.1 %), urinary antigen tests for legionella pneumophila in 67 (30 %)/9 (16 %), and sputum investigation in 55 (25 %)/17 (30 %), respectively. the most frequent pathogens in cap were streptococcus pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumoniae, l. pneumophila, staphylococcus aureus, and enterobacter cloacae; in aecopd they were escherichia coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. all cap patients (mean = 11.1 days) and 35 (61.4 %) of aecopd patients (mean = 8.9 days) received  antibiotics. cap patients were given mostly aminopenicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitors and aecopd patients were given mostly cephalosporins. conclusions: pathogens isolated in cap and aecopd and the antibiotic therapy used are in good  accordance with the guidelines. blood culture, recommended for all cap patients,  was performed in only 50 % of the cases and antibiotic therapy lasted longer than the suggested 5-7 days. therefore, international guidelines regarding performance of blood culture and duration of antibiotic therapy should be adopted more often. this duration was independent of the number of isolated pathogens and number of symptoms on admission. therefore, the question arises as to whether microbiological data are necessary only for patients who are resistant to initial therapy.

TI  == bacterial pathogens in first febrile urinary tract infection affect breakthrough  infections in infants with vesicoureteral reflux treated with prophylactic antibiotics.
AB  == objective: to investigate the risk factors for recurrent urinary tract infections (utis) in infants with vesicoureteral reflux (vur) and whether bacterial pathogen affected breakthrough uti or not. methods: we compared children with infantile vur with recurrent uti (33 males, 11 females, mean age 3.2 months) and without recurrent uti (40 males, 7 females, mean age 4.8 months). the following were compared between the 2 groups: sex, timing of uti episode, bacterial growth on urine culture, degree and bilaterality of the reflux, hydronephrosis, renal scar, and delayed ureteral excretion of refluxed contrast on voiding cystourethrogram (vcug). results: univariate cox survival-time regression showed that younger age  at first uti, a non-escherichia coli strain, bilateral and vur, high-grade vur, and hydronephrosis on initial ultrasonography (usg) significantly increased the risks of recurrent uti (p <.05 each). in multivariate analysis, timing of the uti episode (p = .015), a non-e. coli strain (p = .003), high grade (p = .012), and bilateral vur (p = .002) were independently associated with increased risk of recurrent uti. non-e. coli strains were identified in 60% and 33% of infants with and without recurrent uti, respectively. conclusion: during the first year of life, the earlier the first uti then the higher the chance is for recurrent utis. higher grades of reflux, bilateral vur, and the first infection by a non-e. coli  strain all significantly increase the risk of recurrent utis.

TI  == carbapenem susceptibilities and non-susceptibility concordance to different carbapenems amongst clinically important gram-negative bacteria isolated from intensive care units in taiwan: results from the surveillance of multicentre antimicrobial resistance in taiwan (smart) in 2009.
AB  == to investigate the in vitro susceptibilities to various carbapenems amongst clinical gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients in intensive care units of ten major teaching hospitals in taiwan in 2009, a survey was conducted to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem and doripenem against isolates of enterobacteriaceae (n = 594), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 185), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 192) and burkholderia cepacia (n = 23) using the agar dilution method. susceptibilities were determined according to 2009, 2011 and 2012 mic breakpoints recommended by the clsi as well as 2012 mic breakpoints recommended by eucast. based on clsi 2012 criteria, the ertapenem susceptible rate was 93%, 81%, 68% and 92% for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens, respectively. all proteus mirabilis and morganella morganii isolates  were susceptible to ertapenem; however, 64% of p. mirabilis and all m. morganii isolates were non-susceptible to imipenem. meropenem and doripenem had better activities than imipenem against ertapenem-non-susceptible enterobacteriaceae isolates. e. coli, k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae with ertapenem mics>/=4 mg/l were synchronously not susceptible to imipenem, meropenem and doripenem. imipenem susceptibility was 65% and 29% for p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii, respectively.  additionally, p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii isolates with imipenem mics>/=8 mg/l were also not susceptible to meropenem and doripenem. these data provide a better understanding of choosing appropriate carbapenem agents to treat infections caused by ertapenem-non-susceptible enterobacteriaceae as well as p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii isolates with imipenem mics>/=4 mg/l.

TI  == serum in vivo and in vitro activity of single dose of ertapenem in surgical obese patients for prevention of ssis.
AB  == background: despite progress made in the control of post-operative infections, the incidence of surgical site infections (ssis) is still high. an improper perioperative antibiotic use can expose patients to the risk of resistant microorganisms, and, in surgical obese patients, the drug dosage and infusion time are critical points. the aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness  of ertapenem in the prophylaxis of ssis in obese patients undergoing general or bariatric surgery. methods: a total of 63 obese patients, candidates for several  surgical interventions, were enrolled and divided into two groups. patients received antibiotic prophylaxis before surgery: the case group received venous infusion of ertapenem; the control group received standard prophylaxis. serum samples were tested for antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. results: after single-dose ertapenem in obese patients, we registered in vitro activity of sera against the growth of non-extended beta lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, and non-esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae. moreover, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus viridans  were also inhibited. we found in vivo efficacy according to clinical monitoring:  at the weekly and monthly follow-ups, one patient in the case group and six patients in the control group presented superficial incisional ssis. conclusions: these preliminary results are suggestive of the efficacy of ertapenem in perioperative prophylaxis of ssis in obese patients; however, they need to be confirmed by further investigations and more defined trials.

TI  == faecal carriage of oxyiminocephalosporin-resistant enterobacteriaceae among paediatric units in different hospitals in the south of france.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the presence of oxyiminocephalosporin-resistant (ocr) gram-negative bacilli and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing isolates in stool specimens obtained from paediatric patients hospitalised for acute diarrhoea. we conducted a prospective, multicentre study over a period of 6 months in seven hospitals in the south of france. samplings were carried out from infants admitted for acute diarrhoea with no previous antibiotic treatment in the last week. bacteria in stool specimens were screened for the presence of ocr gram-negative bacilli on drigalski agar supplemented with ceftazidime and esbl chromagar(r) media, and confirmed by the rosco tablets test. genetic detection was performed by the check mdr(r) microarray and by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and sequencing with bacterial dna extracted from isolates. the presence of ocr enterobacteria was markedly high (177/1,118 patients, 15.2 %), with an important community origin (66.1 %). the majority of multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacteria were enterobacter cloacae (106, 59.9 %) and escherichia coli (61, 34.5 %). the prevalence of esbl and ctx-m producers represented 5.2 and 4.3 % of the isolates, respectively. the main proportion of these esbl carriers was found in children less than 1 year of age (53.4 %). one carbapenemase (imp-1) was detected. the study revealed the wide dissemination of mdr bacteria in infants attending hospitals in the south of france during a non-outbreak situation, in particular, the spread of cefotaximase and the detection of a carbapenemase. this worrisome situation must reinforce the use of hygiene procedures and appropriate antibiotics to control the emergence and spread of ocr organisms.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria convert glucosinolates to nitriles efficiently yet differently from enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == glucosinolates from the genus brassica can be converted into bioactive compounds  known to induce phase ii enzymes, which may decrease the risk of cancers. conversion via hydrolysis is usually by the brassica enzyme myrosinase, which can be inactivated by cooking or storage. we examined the potential of three beneficial bacteria, lactobacillus plantarum kw30, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis kf147, and escherichia coli nissle 1917, and known myrosinase-producer enterobacter cloacae to catalyze the conversion of glucosinolates in broccoli extract. enterobacteriaceae consumed on average 65% glucoiberin and 78% glucoraphanin, transforming them into glucoiberverin and glucoerucin, respectively, and small amounts of iberverin nitrile and erucin nitrile. the lactic acid bacteria did not accumulate reduced glucosinolates, consuming all at  30-33% and transforming these into iberverin nitrile, erucin nitrile, sulforaphane nitrile, and further unidentified metabolites. adding beneficial bacteria to a glucosinolate-rich diet may increase glucosinolate transformation,  thereby increasing host exposure to bioactives.

TI  == characteristics of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase- and carbapenemase-producing  enterobacteriaceae isolates from rivers and lakes in switzerland.
AB  == one of the currently most relevant resistance mechanisms in enterobacteriaceae is the production of enzymes that lead to modern expanded-spectrum cephalosporin and even carbapenem resistance, mainly extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) and  carbapenemases. a worrisome aspect is the spread of esbl and carbapenemase producers into the environment. the aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence of esbl- and carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae and to further characterize esbl- and carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae in rivers and lakes in switzerland. esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae were detected in 21 (36.2%) of the 58 bodies of water sampled. one river sample tested positive for a carbapenemase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae strain. seventy-four individual strains expressing an esbl phenotype were isolated. species identification revealed 60 escherichia coli strains, seven klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae strains, five raoultella planticola strains, one enterobacter cloacae strain, and one enterobacter amnigenus strain. three strains were identified as shv-12 esbl producers, and 71 strains carried genes encoding ctx-m esbls. of the 71 strains with ctx-m esbl genes, 8 isolates expressed ctx-m-1, three produced ctx-m-3, 46 produced ctx-m-15, three produced ctx-m-55, one produced ctx-m-79, six produced ctx-m-14, and four produced ctx-m-27. three of the four ctx-m-27 producers belonged to the multiresistant pandemic sequence type e. coli b2:st131 that is strongly associated with potentially severe infections in humans and animals.

AB  == the new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase gene (bla(ndm-1)) has emerged as a worldwide concern among isolates of enterobacteriaceae. its epidemiology is been strongly associated with travel and healthcare on the indian subcontinent. we report two cases of urinary tract infection with enterobacteriaceae harboring a bla(ndm-1).  both cases presented as infection in community-dwelling individuals in australia  and were associated with travel to the indian subcontinent. one isolate of escherichia coli harbored the previously undescribed enzyme variant bla(ndm-3), differing from bla(ndm-1) by a single nonsynonymous snp conferring a putative peptide sequence change at the 95th position (asp-->asn). the second was an enterobacter cloacae harboring bla(ndm-1). further genetic characterization included identification of additional beta-lactamase and aminoglycoside resistance genes. legacy antimicrobials were used for treatment. oral therapy with nitrofurantoin was successful in one case, while combination of colistin and rifampicin was required in the second patient. such infection, due to extensively drug-resistant pathogens, poses significant challenges in balancing the efficacy  and toxicity of potential antimicrobial therapies.

TI  == microbial uropathogens and their antibiotic resistance profile from hospitalized  patients in central alabama.
AB  == urinary tract infections remain a common problem in inpatient care. they are highly challenging to provide effective initial therapy without sensitivity data. the purpose of this study was to survey the uropathogens and their sensitivity profile at a hospital in central alabama and to guide experiential antibiotic selection. this was the first reported study on bacterial uropathogens and their  antibiotic resistance profile at this central alabama hospital. the survey period was between july 2009 and june 2010, a total of 473 urine cultures were reviewed  and susceptibility testing was determined using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) microdilution method. the results indicated that escherichia coli (45.5%) was the most common organism, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (18.2%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.1%), proteus mirabilis (7.8%), enterobacter cloacae (4.2%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (3.0%),  klebsiella oxytoca and citrobacter freundii (1.5%), morganella morganii (1.3%), and the other species (7.0%). for the 215 e. coli isolates, imipenem and cephalosporins (except for cefazolin) had the highest sensitivity (99-100%, p < 0.05). in contrast, ampicillin had the highest resistance (57%, p < 0.05) as compared to other antibiotics (about 30%) including ampicillin/ sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. the major finding of this study was that ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole had comparable sensitivity patterns for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae, the most common uropathogens at this central alabama hospital. additionally, this study found that e. coli had a resistant rate of 31% to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin compared to the resistance rate of 28.4% and 15.8% in earlier reports (lee et al. 2010; rattanaumpawan et al. 2010), likely indicating the continuing evolution of resistance due to antibiotic exposure. it is imperative to monitor the resistance of p. aeruginosa considering their high resistance to imipenem found in this study.

TI  == molecular and epidemiological characterization of enterobacterial multidrug-resistant strains in tlemcen hospital (algeria) (2008-2010).
AB  == seventy-one isolates of enterobacteriaceae (17 escherichia coli, 50 klebsiella pneumoniae, and 4 enterobacter cloacae) producing extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases (esbls) were collected between april 2008 and march 2010 in an intensive care unit and surgical ward of tlemcen hospital (west  of algeria). sequencing identified the bla(ctx-m-15) determinant in 69 isolates and bla(ctx-m-3) in 2 isolates. none of the studied strains produced the class d  carbapenemase oxa-48. repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction showed a high degree of genotypic diversity among e. coli strains and two major clonal populations of k. pneumoniae (ckp1 n=11 and ckp5 n=25) which were further  identified as members of the multilocus sequence typing types (st931) and (st15), respectively. the st15 isolates harbored more resistance genes and virulence factors than the st931 isolates. the characterization of the spacer region between isecp1 and bla(ctx-m) for ctx-m-15 producers individualized two populations. one that derived from the ctx-m-3 under algerian clinical context and one that is universally found. the dissemination of esbls in the studied enterobacteriaceae isolates was mainly due to the epidemic clones of k. pneumoniae and to genetic transit of plasmids among unrelated strains.

TI  == identification of the enterobacteriaceae in montasio cheese and assessment of their amino acid decarboxylase activity.
AB  == the aim of the study was to identify the species of enterobacteriaceae present in montasio cheese and to assess their potential to produce biogenic amines. plate count methods and an enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus polymerase chain reaction (eric-pcr) approach, combined with 16s rdna sequencing, were used  to investigate the enterobacteriaceae community present during the cheesemaking and ripening of 6 batches of montasio cheese. additionally, the potential decarboxylation abilities of selected bacterial isolates were qualitatively and quantitatively assessed against tyrosine, histidine, ornithine and lysine. the most predominant species detected during cheese manufacturing and ripening were enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli and hafnia alvei. the non-limiting physico-chemical conditions (ph, nacl% and a(w)) during ripening were probably the cause of the presence of detectable levels of enterobacteriaceae up to 120 d  of ripening. the hplc test showed that cadaverine and putrescine were the amines  produced in higher amounts by almost all isolates, indicating that the presence of these amines in cheese can be linked to the presence of high counts of enterobacteriaceae. 44 isolates produced low amounts of histamine (<300 ppm), and four isolates produced more than 1000 ppm of this amine. only 9 isolates, belonging to the species citrobacter freundii, esch. coli and raoultella ornithinolytica, appeared to produce tyramine. these data provided new information regarding the decarboxylase activity of some enterobacteriaceae species, including pantoea agglomerans, esch. fergusonii and r. ornithinolytica.

TI  == intestinal enterobacteriaceae and escherichia coli populations in japanese adults demonstrated by the reverse transcription-quantitative pcr and the clone library  analyses.
AB  == a primer set specific for escherichia coli/shigella 16s rrna was developed and used for rt-qpcr analysis of fecal samples from 35 healthy adult volunteers in combination with the previously reported primer set specific for enterobacteriaceae. enterobacteriaceae and e. coli were present in the 29 out of  35 volunteers tested as intestinal commensals at the average population levels of 10(7.1+/-0.9) and 10(6.8+/-0.7)cellsg(-1) of stools (mean+/-standard deviation),  respectively. among the 7 volunteers, the significant deviation between the count of enterobacteriaceae and that of e. coli was observed, suggesting non-e. coli/shigella species were predominant in their enterobacteriaceae populations. the clone library analysis revealed that the non-e. coli/shigella populations included citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae/variicola and morganella morganii. these data suggested that the rt-qpcr method with the primer sets specific to both enterobacteriaceae and e. coli/shigella enabled the accurate enumeration of  intestinal e. coli populations and the other enterobacteriaceae species populations.

TI  == [common pathogens and clinical characteristics of neonatal pneumonia].
AB  == objective: to study common pathogens and their antibiotic susceptibility as well  as clinical characteristics of neonatal pneumonia. methods: a retrospective study on neonatal pneumonia was performed. the study investigated antibiotic susceptibility of four common pathogens (339 strains) that caused neonatal pneumonia. clinical characteristics of the newborns with pneumonia were analyzed. of the 339 strains, 185 were isolated from bronchial secretions, 72 from blood samples, and 82 with positive results of both samples. results: four hundred and  seventy-four neonates with pneumonia presented positive results of bacterial culture. the most common pathogens staphylococcus aureus (21.9%), escherichia coli (19.2%), klebsiella pneumoniae (19.0%) and enterobacter cloacae (11.4%). the birth weight of newborns infected with staphylococcus aureus was generally normal, and the time of hospital admission was later (after 24 hours of life). in contrast, the newborns with gram-negative bacterial infection, especially klebsiella pneumoniae infection, had lower birth weights and early time of hospital admission (within 24 hours of life). nearly more than 50% gram-negative  bacteria were resistant to second, third and forth generation cephaloporins. conclusions: gram-negative bacteria are predominant pathogens of neonatal pneumonia. neonatal pneumonia caused by gram-negative bacteria is common in newborns with low birth weight and its onset time is relatively earlier. gram-negative bacteria that cause neonatal pneumonia are highly resistant to cephaloporins.

TI  == diversity of the bacterial and fungal microflora from the midgut and cuticle of phlebotomine sand flies collected in north-western iran.
AB  == background: phlebotomine sand flies are the vectors of the leishmaniases, parasitic diseases caused by leishmania spp. little is known about the prevalence and diversity of sand fly microflora colonizing the midgut or the cuticle. particularly, there is little information on the fungal diversity. this information is important for development of vector control strategies. methodology/principal findings: five sand fly species: phlebotomus papatasi, p. sergenti, p. kandelakii, p. perfiliewi and p. halepensis were caught in bileh savar and kaleybar in north-western iran that are located in endemic foci of visceral leishmaniasis. a total of 35 specimens were processed. bacterial and fungal strains were identified by routine microbiological methods. we characterized 39 fungal isolates from the cuticle and/or the midgut. they belong  to six different genera including penicillium (17 isolates), aspergillus (14), acremonium (5), fusarium (1), geotrichum (1) and candida (1). we identified 33 gram-negative bacteria: serratia marcescens (9 isolates), enterobacter cloacae (6), pseudomonas fluorescens (6), klebsiella ozaenae (4), acinetobacter sp. (3),  escherichia coli (3), asaia sp. (1) and pantoea sp. (1) as well as gram-positive  bacteria bacillus subtilis (5) and micrococcus luteus (5) in 10 isolates. conclusion/significance: our study provides new data on the microbiotic diversity of field-collected sand flies and for the first time, evidence of the presence of asaia sp. in sand flies. we have also found a link between physiological stages (unfed, fresh fed, semi gravid and gravid) of sand flies and number of bacteria that they carry. interestingly pantoea sp. and klebsiella ozaenae have been isolated in old world sand fly species. the presence of latter species on sand fly cuticle and in the female midgut suggests a role for this arthropod in dissemination of these pathogenic bacteria in endemic areas. further experiments  are required to clearly delineate the vectorial role (passive or active) of sand  flies.

TI  == metagenomic cloning and characterization of na(+) transporters from huamachi salt lake in china.
AB  == moderately halophilic bacteria are a kind of extreme environment microorganism that can tolerate moderate salt concentrations ranging from 0.5m to 2.5m. here, via a metagenomic library screen, we identified four putative na(+) transporters, designated h7-nha, h16-mppe, h19-cap and h35-mrp, from moderately halophilic community in the hypersaline soil of huamachi salt lake, china. functional complementation observed in a na(+)(ca(2+))/h(+) antiporter-defective escherichia coli mutant (knabc) suggests that the four putative na(+) transporters could confer cells a capacity of na(+) resistance probably by enhancing na(+) or ca(2+) efflux, but not li(+) or k(+) exchange. blastp analysis of the deduced amino-acid sequences indicates that h7-nha has 71% identity to the nhag na(+)/h(+) antiporter of bacillus subtilis, while h19-cap shows 99% identity to enterobacter cloacae ca(2+) antiporter. interestingly, h16-mppe shares 59% identity to the metallophosphoesterase of bacillus cellulosilyticus and h35-mrp shows 68% identity to multidrug resistance protein of lysinibacillus sphaericus. this is the first report that predicts a potential role of metallophosphoesterase in na(+) resistance in halophilic bacteria. furthermore, everted membrane vesicles prepared from e. coli cells harboring h7-nha exhibit na(+)/h(+) antiporter activity, but not li(+) (k(+))/h(+) antiporter activity, confirming that h7-nha supports na(+) resistance mainly via na(+)/h(+) antiport. our report also demonstrates that metagenomic library screen is a convenient and effective way to explore more novel types of na(+) transporters.

TI  == characterization of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes in enterobacteriaceae clinical strains and characterization of the plasmids implicated in their diffusion.
AB  == a total of 788 clinical enterobacteriaceae were collected to describe the aminoglycoside-modifying genes (ame genes) and to characterize the plasmids that  carry these genes. among the 788 strains collected, 330 (41.8%) were aminoglycoside-resistant: 264 escherichia coli (80%), 33 proteus mirabilis (10%), 10 klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), six k. oxytoca (1.8%), five enterobacter cloacae (1.5%), three morganella morganii (0.9%), three providencia stuartii (0.9%), two  salmonella enterica (0.6%), and one each citrobacter freundii, c. koseri, proteus vulgaris, and shigella sonnei. the most affected aminoglycoside was streptomycin  (92.7%), followed by kanamycin (26.3%), gentamicin (18%), tobramycin (16.9%), netilmicin (3.6%), and amikacin (1.5%). the ame genes found were aph(3'')-ib (65.4%), ant(3'')-ia (37.5%), aph(3')-ia (13.9%), aac(3)-iia (12.4%), aac(6')-ib  (4.2%), ant(2'')-ia (3.6%), and aph(3')-iia (1.2%). thirty-four percent of the strains showed more than one enzyme. the most frequent association was ant(3'')-ia plus aph(3'')-ib (35 strains). from 66 selected ame genes, 24 were plasmid located: 12 aac(3)-iia, six aph(3')-ia, three ant(3'')-ia, two ant(2'')-ia, and one aac(6')-ib. these genes were located in plasmids belonging to incompatibility groups f, fia, fib, or hi2. in conclusion, the ame genes involved in aminoglycoside-clinical resistance were aac(3)-iia, aac(6')-ib, and ant(2'')-ia, genes that confer resistance to tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin.

AB  == data on biliary carriage of bacteria and, specifically, of bacteria with worrisome and unexpected resistance traits (urb) are lacking. a prospective study (april 2010 to december 2011) was performed that included all patients admitted for <48 h for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a spanish hospital. bile samples were cultured and epidemiological/clinical data recorded. logistic regression models (stepwise) were performed using bactobilia or bactobilia by urb as dependent variables. models (p < 0.001) showing the highest r(2) values were considered. a total of 198 patients (40.4% males; age, 55.3 +/- 17.3 years) were  included. bactobilia was found in 44 of them (22.2%). the presence of bactobilia  was associated (r(2) cox, 0.30) with previous biliary endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp) (odds ratio [or], 8.95; 95% confidence interval [ci], 2.96 to 27.06; p < 0.001), previous admission (or, 2.82; 95% ci, 1.10 to 7.24; p = 0.031), and age (or, 1.09 per year; 95% ci, 1.05 to 1.12; p < 0.001). ten out of the 44 (22.7%) patients with bactobilia carried urb: 1 escherichia coli isolate (ctx-m), 1 klebsiella pneumoniae isolate (oxa-48), 3 high-level gentamicin-resistant enterococci, 1 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus isolate, 3  enterobacter cloacae strains, and 1 imipenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa strain. bactobilia by urb (versus those by non-urb) was only associated (r(2) cox, 0.19) with previous ercp (or, 11.11; 95% ci, 1.98 to 62.47; p = 0.006). for  analyses of patients with bactobilia by urb versus the remaining patients, previous ercp (or, 35.284; 95% ci, 5.320 to 234.016; p < 0.001), previous intake  of antibiotics (or, 7.200; 95% ci, 0.962 to 53.906; p = 0.050), and age (or, 1.113 per year of age; 95% ci, 1.028 to 1.206; p = 0.009) were associated with bactobilia by urb (r(2) cox, 0.19; p < 0.001). previous antibiotic exposure (in addition to age and previous ercp) was a risk driver for bactobilia by urb. this  may have implications in prophylactic/therapeutic measures.

TI  == interference in quorum sensing signal transmission amongst microbial species.
AB  == antibiotics are usually studied on pure cultures of a single bacterial strain, whereas multi-species communities that inhabit human niches and the biosphere are generally ignored. the modification of quorum sensing (qs) is investigated in a system involving a co-existing signal producer and sensor bacterial cells. a pure culture of merely one bacterial species is quite rare in any niche. the interactions of different bacterial species may therefore be of special importance in pathogenicity, antibiotic resistance and signal transmission.in the present study the authors investigated the qs in model experiments involving several gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species isolated from human infections or laboratory strains. the effects of various compounds on qs were studied in mixed bacterial populations during the incubation period of 24-48 h. as the simplest example of co-existing cell populations, the n-acyl homoserine lactone producing ezf 10-17 was applied with chromobacterium violaceum 026 as sensor.the signal of qs transmission between the co-existing qs system and pathogenic bacteria isolated from various patients was found to be modified by certain bacterial cells. the bacterial-bacterial interactions in a mixed flora can change the classical signal transmission in the microbial community and should therefore be taken into consideration in rational chemotherapy.

TI  == the target of daptomycin is absent from escherichia coli and other gram-negative  pathogens.
AB  == antistaphylococcal agents commonly lack activity against gram-negative bacteria like escherichia coli owing to the permeability barrier presented by the outer membrane and/or the action of efflux transporters. when these intrinsic resistance mechanisms are artificially compromised, such agents almost invariably demonstrate antibacterial activity against gram negatives. here we show that this is not the case for the antibiotic daptomycin, whose target appears to be absent  from e. coli and other gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == identification and characterization of a novel incompatibility group x3 plasmid carrying bla ndm-1 in enterobacteriaceae isolates with epidemiological links to multiple geographical areas in china.
AB  == the new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (ndm-1) is one of the most important resistance traits in enterobacteriaceae. we characterized nine bla ndm-1 producing enterobacteriaceae recovered from seven patients who have recently travelled or been treated in india (n=1) or mainland china (n=6) during december  2010-may 2012. all the china-linked patients had no links to the indian subcontinent. the bla ndm-1 carrying plasmids belonged to the novel incx3 ( approximately 50 kb, in seven isolates including two escherichia coli, two klebsiella pneumoniae, one citrobacter freundii, one enterobacter aerogenes and one e. cloacae), inca/c2 ( approximately 140 kb, in one e. coli) or fii-f1b groups ( approximately 110 kb, in one e. coli). restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the seven incx3 plasmids revealed identical pattern in six and two bands difference in the remaining one. the incx3 plasmids carrying bla ndm-1 were epidemiologically linked to guangzhou (n=1), hunan (n=4), haifeng  (n=1) and dongguan (n=1) in mainland china. complete sequencing of the incx3 plasmid pndm-hn380 revealed that it was 54 035 bp long and encoded 52 open reading frames. the bla ndm-1 gene was found in a transposon-like structure flanked by isaba125 and is26, inserted into the plasmid genetic load region. the  sequences of the bla ndm-1 containing module within the two is elements were identical to those previously described for bla ndm-1-positive tn125 in the plasmids or chromosome of acinetobacter isolates. in summary, this is the first description of incx3 plasmids carrying bla ndm-1. the findings indicate the worrisome involvement of an epidemic plasmid in the dissemination of ndm-1 in china.

TI  == antibiotics involved in the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria: a nationwide multilevel study suggests differences within antibiotic classes.
AB  == objectives: to identify the antibiotics potentially the most involved in the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria from an ecological perspective in french healthcare facilities (hcfs). methods: this study was based on data from the french antimicrobial surveillance network (atb-raisin, 2007-09). antibiotics  were expressed in defined daily doses per 1000 patient-days. antibiotic-resistant bacteria were considered as count data adjusted for patient-days. these were third-generation cephalosporin (3gc)- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli, cefotaxime-resistant enterobacter cloacae, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and ceftazidime-, imipenem- and ciprofloxacin-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa. three-level negative binomial regression models were built to take into account the hierarchical structure of data: level 1, repeated  measures each year (count outcome, time, antibiotics); level 2, hcfs (type and size); and level 3, regions (geographical area). results: a total of 701 hcfs from 20 french regions and up to 1339 hcf-years were analysed. the use of ceftriaxone, but not of cefotaxime, was positively correlated with incidence rates of 3gc- and ciprofloxacin-resistant e. coli. in contrast, both 3gcs were positively correlated with the incidence rate of cefotaxime-resistant e. cloacae. higher levels of use of ciprofloxacin and/or ofloxacin, but not of levofloxacin,  were associated with higher incidence rates of 3gc- and ciprofloxacin-resistant e. coli, cefotaxime-resistant e. cloacae, methicillin-resistant s. aureus and ceftazidime- and ciprofloxacin-resistant p. aeruginosa. conclusions: our study suggests differences within antibiotic classes in promoting antibiotic resistance. we identified ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin as priority targets in public health strategies designed to reduce antibiotic use and antibiotic-resistant bacteria in french hcfs.

TI  == identification and characterization of two novel bla(kluc) resistance genes through large-scale resistance plasmids sequencing.
AB  == plasmids are important antibiotic resistance determinant carriers that can disseminate various drug resistance genes among species or genera. by using a high throughput sequencing approach, two groups of plasmids of escherichia coli (named e1 and e2, each consisting of 160 clinical e. coli strains isolated from different periods of time) were sequenced and analyzed. a total of 20 million reads were obtained and mapped onto the known resistance gene sequences. as a result, a total of 9 classes, including 36 types of antibiotic resistant genes, were identified. among these genes, 25 and 27 single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) appeared, of which 9 and 12 snps are nonsynonymous substitutions in the e1 and e2 samples. it is interesting to find that a novel genotype of bla(kluc), whose close relatives, bla(kluc-1) and bla(kluc-2), have been previously reported as carried on the kluyvera cryocrescens chromosome and enterobacter cloacae plasmid, was identified. it shares 99% and 98% amino acid identities with kluc-1  and kluc-2, respectively. further pcr screening of 608 enterobacteriaceae family  isolates yielded a second variant (named bla(kluc-4)). it was interesting to find that kluc-3 showed resistance to several cephalosporins including cefotaxime, whereas bla(kluc-4) did not show any resistance to the antibiotics tested. this may be due to a positively charged residue, arg, replaced by a neutral residue, leu, at position 167, which is located within an omega-loop. this work represents large-scale studies on resistance gene distribution, diversification and genetic  variation in pooled multi-drug resistance plasmids, and provides insight into the use of high throughput sequencing technology for microbial resistance gene detection.

AB  == we report a green synthesis of silver nanoparticles that uses extracts from the aerial part of artemisia capillaris. both water and 70% ethanol extracts successfully generated silver nanoparticles. the formation of silver nanoparticles was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance bands, fourier transform-infrared spectra, high resolution-transmission electron and atomic force microscopic images. various shapes of silver nanoparticles were generated with an average diameter of 29.71 nm with water extract and 29.62 nm with 70% ethanol extract. an improvement in antibacterial activity (mic 8.35-16.7 microg/ml) was observed against a total of twenty different strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. a remarkable enhancement (approximately 12-fold) was observed against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, and klebsiella areogenes when compared  with the extract alone. silver nanoparticles produced by the 70% ethanol extract  showed slightly higher antibacterial activity than those generated with the water extract. the correlation between total flavonoid content of each extract and the  antibacterial activity did not exert any significant relationships. this report suggests that plant extracts have the potential to be used as powerful reducing agents for the production of biocompatible silver nanoparticles possessing enhanced antibacterial activities.

TI  == effect of transcriptional activators soxs, roba, and rama on expression of multidrug efflux pump acrab-tolc in enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == control of membrane permeability is a key step in regulating the intracellular concentration of antibiotics. efflux pumps confer innate resistance to a wide range of toxic compounds such as antibiotics, dyes, detergents, and disinfectants in members of the enterobacteriaceae. the acrab-tolc efflux pump is involved in multidrug resistance in enterobacter cloacae. however, the underlying mechanism that regulates the system in this microorganism remains unknown. in escherichia coli, the transcription of acrab is upregulated under global stress conditions by proteins such as mara, soxs, and rob. in the present study, two clinical isolates of e. cloacae, ecdc64 (a multidrug-resistant strain overexpressing the acrab-tolc efflux pump) and jc194 (a strain with a basal acrab-tolc expression level), were  used to determine whether similar global stress responses operate in e. cloacae and also to establish the molecular mechanisms underlying this response. a decrease in susceptibility to erythromycin, tetracycline, telithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and chloramphenicol was observed in clinical isolate jc194 and, to a lesser extent in ecdc64, in the presence of salicylate, decanoate, tetracycline, and paraquat. increased expression of the acrab promoter in the presence of the above-described conditions was observed by flow cytometry and reverse transcription-pcr, by using a reporter fusion protein (green fluorescent  protein). the expression level of the acrab promoter decreased in e. cloacae ecdc64 derivates deficient in soxs, roba, and rama. accordingly, the expression level of the acrab promoter was higher in e. cloacae jc194 strains overproducing  soxs, roba, and rama. overall, the data showed that soxs, roba, and rama regulators were associated with the upregulation of acrab, thus conferring antimicrobial resistance as well as a stress response in e. cloacae. in summary,  the regulatory proteins soxs, roba, and rama were cloned and sequenced for the first time in this species. the involvement of these proteins in conferring antimicrobial resistance through upregulation of acrab was demonstrated in e. cloacae.

TI  == catheter-related complications in cancer patients on home parenteral nutrition: a prospective study of over 51,000 catheter days.
AB  == background: although home parenteral nutrition (hpn) is often indicated in cancer patients, many physicians are concerned about the risks potentially associated with the use of central venous access devices (vads) in these patients. the aim of this prospective study was to investigate the actual incidence of vad-related  complications in cancer patients on hpn. methods: all adult cancer patient candidates for vad insertion and hpn were enrolled. the incidence of complications associated with 4 types of vads (peripherally inserted central catheter [picc], hohn catheter, tunneled groshong catheter, and port) was investigated, as well as the most significant risk factors. results: two hundred  eighty-nine vads in 254 patients were studied, for a total of 51,308 catheter-days. the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections (crbsis)  was low (0.35/1000 catheter-days), particularly for piccs (0/1000; p < .01 vs hohn and tunneled catheters) and for ports (0.19/1000; p < .01 vs hohn and p < .05 vs tunneled catheters). mechanical complications were uncommon (0.8/1000), as was vad-related venous thrombosis (0.06/1000). ultrasound-guided venipuncture was associated with a decreased risk of crbsi (p < .04) and thrombosis (p < .001). vad securement using sutureless devices reduced the risk of crbsi and dislocation (p < .001). hohn catheters had no advantage over piccs (higher complication rate  and shorter dwell time; p < .001). conclusions: in cancer patients, hpn can be safely carried out with a low incidence of complications. also, vads are not equal in terms of complication rates, and strict adherence to meticulous insertion policies may effectively reduce catheter-related complications.

TI  == bloodstream infections caused by imp-8-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates: the need for clinical laboratory detection of metallo-beta-lactamases?
AB  == a retrospective study was conducted at a taiwanese medical center to characterize bloodstream infections caused by imp-8 metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates and to assess the need for laboratory detection of imp producers. we analyzed 37 patients infected with imp-8 producers (two escherichia coli, nine klebsiella pneumoniae, 25 enterobacter cloacae, and one citrobacter freundii) and 107 patients infected with non-imp-8 producers (eight e. coli, 26 k. pneumoniae, 70 e. cloacae, and three c. freundii) that were interpreted as carbapenem-nonsusceptible based on the updated clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) 2010 guidelines. only 18 (48.6 %) of the imp-8 producers were regarded as potential carbapenemase producers based on the clsi 2012 guidelines. the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) was more common in the mbl group (73.0 %) than in the non-mbl group (41.1 %). there were no significant differences in carbapenem susceptibilities, clinical characteristics, carbapenem use for empirical and definitive treatment, and mortality rates between the two groups. eighteen imp-8 producers could be deemed  as resistant to all carbapenems [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of any carbapenem >/=2 mug/ml]; patients with these isolates had a lower, but non-significant, 28-day mortality rate (27.8 %) than patients infected with non-mbl producers having similar carbapenem mics (39.0 %) (p = 0.41). a multivariate analysis revealed severity of acute illness as the single independent variable associated with both 7-day and 28-day mortality rates (p < 0.01) for infections caused by enterobacteriaceae with decreased carbapenem susceptibilities. our findings suggest that the clinical detection of imp-producing enterobacteriaceae is not required even when the "old" clsi criteria are used.

TI  == characterization of fluoroquinolone and cephalosporin resistance mechanisms in enterobacteriaceae isolated in a dutch teaching hospital reveals the presence of  an escherichia coli st131 clone with a specific mutation in pare.
AB  == objectives: to characterize the mechanisms of fluoroquinolone and cephalosporin resistance in enterobacteriaceae from a dutch teaching hospital in 2008. methods: we sequenced gyra, gyrb, parc and pare. the presence of plasmid-encoded genes qnra, qnrb, qnrs, aac(6')-ib, qepa, bla(tem), bla(shv,) bla(oxa), bla(ctx-m) and  bla(ampc) was studied by pcr. escherichia coli isolates were further characterized by aflp and multilocus sequence typing (mlst). results: in total, 49 e. coli, 16 klebsiella pneumoniae and 3 enterobacter cloacae isolates were investigated. mutations in gyra were found in all e. coli isolates. forty-five (92%) e. coli isolates carried at least one point mutation in parc. most e. coli  isolates (59%) also carried mutations in pare, of which i529l was the most prevalent. i529l was unequivocally associated with e. coli sequence type (st) 131. this single-nucleotide polymorphism (snp) was later also found in eight out  of nine st131 strains from another collection. twenty-nine e. coli isolates carried extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) genes, predominantly bla(ctx-m-15). in e. coli, aac(6')-ib-cr was the predominant plasmid-mediated resistance mechanism, whereas in k. pneumoniae qnr genes were found mostly. in k. pneumoniae isolates, qnr and aac(6')-ib-cr co-occurred with esbl genes (n = 13; bla(ctx-m) and bla(shv)) and/or bla(ampc) (n = 3; bla(dha-1)). conclusions: e. coli st131 was the predominant clone, which accumulated a high number of chromosomal mutations. the i529l snp in pare was a signature of most, but not all, st131 strains. in contrast to e. coli, fluoroquinolone resistance mechanisms were predominantly plasmid-encoded in k. pneumoniae.

TI  == real-time pcr for detection of blaoxa-48 genes from stools.
AB  == objectives: outbreaks of oxa-48-like carbapenemase producers are increasingly reported in many european countries and are often the result of difficulties in detection, especially for isolates with mics of carbapenems that remain in the susceptibility range. methods: an in-house real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr) assay using taqman chemistry to detect bla(oxa-48-like) genes was compared with bacterial culturing on chromid esbl and supercarba media of spiked stool samples  with several species producing oxa-48 variants. results: qpcr amplification using plasmid dna was linear over 10 log dilutions (r(2) = 0.998 and slope = -3.14), with an amplification efficiency of 1.10, and the detection limit of the assay was reproducibly estimated at 10 plasmid molecules/pcr. no cross-reaction was detected with dna extracted from several multidrug-resistant bacteria harbouring  other beta-lactam resistance genes. the bla(oxa-48) qpcr assay was capable of detecting 10-50 cfu of oxa-48 producers/100 mg of faeces. chromid esbl was capable of detecting oxa-48 producers (1 x 10(1) to 3 x 10(2) cfu/100 mg of faeces), as long as the isolates exhibited a high level of resistance to cephalosporins due to an associated extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. the supercarba screening medium was capable of detecting all the oxa-48-like producers (1-3 x 10(1) cfu/100 mg of faeces), except those producing oxa-163, a variant lacking carbapenem-hydrolysing activity. conclusions: the qpcr is likely  to shorten the time for bla(oxa-48) detection from 48 to 4 h and will be a valuable tool for outbreak follow-up in order to rapidly isolate colonized patients and assign them to cohorts.

TI  == [investigation of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants in enterobacteriaceae: a multicenter study].
AB  == fluoroquinolones which are in use since 1986, are effective agents both against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. quinolones show bactericidal effect as  a result of inhibition of dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv enzymes. main quinolone resistance mechanisms are chromosomal mutations in these enzymes and decreased intracellular accumulation due to efflux pumps or decreased membrane uptake. recently a new quinolone resistance mechanism mediated by plasmids has been defined. these plasmids carry genes called as qnr. qnr genes do not cause quinolone resistance but they cause decreased quinolone susceptibility and lead to higher minimum inhibitory concentrations. currently there are qnra, qnrb, qnrc, qnrd and qnrs genes. this study was aimed to investigate the presence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants in enterobacteriaceae isolates collected from four different centers in turkey. a total of 647 isolates (387 from trabzon, black sea region; 82 from canakkale, trace region; 96 from ankara,  central anatolia region; 82 from tokat, black sea region) belonging to the enterobacteriaceae family collected between may-july 2009, were included in the study. presence of qnra, qnrb, qnrs and qnrc genes were investigated by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method and confirmed by gene sequencing. the results of the pcr amplification revealed that 2 isolates were positive for qnra, 12 isolates were positive for qnrb, 4 isolates were positive for qnrc and 10 isolates were positive for qnrs. however, the number of positive strains decreased with the use of gene sequencing, and this method led to the identification of qnra1 in two isolates [enterobacter cloacae (code. 796), salmonella group b (code. 491)], qnrb1 in two isolates [salmonella group b (code. 491), citrobacter freundii (code. 768)], qnrb6 in one isolate [escherichia coli (code. cc1800)], qnrb9 in one isolate [e.coli (code. cc1873)], qnrb24 in one isolate [citrobacter koseri (code. mp5200)], qnrb27 in one isolate [c.freundii (code. 842)], qnrs1 in two isolates [e.coli (code. cc1705), e.coli (code.159)] and qnrb2 in one isolate [e.coli (code. 843)]. one of the isolates that carried the qnr gene was ciprofloxacin-resistant and two isolates were nalidixic-acid resistant. transferable quinolone resistance due to the dissemination of qnr genes may have important impacts in terms of infection control and treatment problems. survey of plasmid mediated quinolone resistance will help to determine  the size of the issue and guide the measures that should be taken to avoid escalation of resistance and dissemination problem.

TI  == detection of amp c genes encoding for beta-lactamases in escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == purpose: amp c beta-lactamase are ambler class c enzymes that confer resistance to extended spectrum cephalosporins and are not inhibited by beta-lactamase inhibitors. their detection is crucial, since the phenotypic tests are not standardised leading to ambiguity in interpretation of results. this study was done to detect the types of amp c prevalent in escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr). materials and methods: seventy-seven consecutive cefoxitin resistant clinical isolates of e. coli (n = 25) and k. pneumoniae (n = 52) were included in the study. antibiotic susceptibility testing to various classes of antibiotics was performed by disc diffusion using clinical laboratory standards institute (clsi) guidelines. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) to cefoxitin, imipenem and meropenem were  determined by broth microdilution method. isolates were screened for production of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl). multiplex pcr was performed for the detection of amp c genes after phenotypic testing (hodge test and inhibitor based test). results: cefoxitin hodge test was positive in 40 isolates which included 20 e. coli and 20 k. pneumoniae. there was zone enhancement with boronic acid in  55 isolates, of which 36 were k. pneumoniae and 19 were e. coli. multiplex pcr detected amp c in 11/25 e. coli and 12/52 k. pneumoniae isolates. the amp c genes detected were cit (amp c origin - citrobacter freundii), dha (dhahran hospital, saudi arabia), acc (ambler class c), ebc (amp c origin - enterobacter cloacae) groups. esbl was co-produced in 54 isolates. conclusions: amp c was detected in 29.87% of the study isolates. majority of them co-produced esbl. the most common  amp c was the cit family. screen tests for cefoxitin resistance may be falsely positive due to production of carbapenamases.

TI  == is there a direct antimicrobial effect of botulinum neurotoxin type a?
AB  == study type--therapy (case series) level of evidence 4. what's known on the subject? and what does the study add? several studies describe a reduction of symptomatic urinary tract infections in patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity after intradetrusor injections of botulinum neurotoxin a (bont/a). it was, however, unclear if a direct antibacterial effect of bont/a plays a role  in this clinical observation. this is the first study to investigate a potential  antibacterial effect of two frequently used bont/a formulations (i.e. botox(r) and dysport(r)), providing evidence that bont/a does not exert an antibacterial effect on lower urinary tract pathogens. objective: * to determine a potential direct antimicrobial effect of botulinum neurotoxin type a (bont/a). materials and methods: * a prospective study was carried out using onabotulinumtoxin a (botox(r)) and abobotulinumtoxin a (dypsort(r)) in agar diffusion and broth microdilution assays with various clinical urinary tract isolates (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella oxytoca and bacillus subtilis). * inhibition zones (mm) of bacteria around a disc containing 20 microl saline with 4 iu of botox(r) were measured in the agar diffusion assay. * minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics, iu/ml) of both toxins for all bacteria were determined in the broth microdilution assay after overnight incubation at 35 degrees c. results: * there was no inhibition zone in the agar diffusion assays with any bacterial strain. * the microdilution test using botox(r) and dysport(r) showed bacterial growth in all dilutions, i.e. mics > 20 and >100 iu/ml for botox(r) and dysport(r), respectively. conclusions: * bont/a has no direct antimicrobial effect. * the reduced frequency of symptomatic urinary tract infections (sutis) in patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity (ndo) after  bont/a intradetrusor injections seems to be caused by different indirect mechanisms, which are still not completely understood.

TI  == characterization of two mobilizable plasmids isolated from enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == we isolated two plasmids, ps51a and ps51b which were 5782 bp and 4854 bp in size, respectively, from the third generation cephalosporin-resistant e. cloacae suspected to express metallo-beta-lactamase, and analyzed their structures. these two plasmids encode rna i/rna ii genes for replication origin, relaxase genes of  mobabcd for plasmid transfer, and several open reading frames. according to the classification of mobilizable plasmids by gene organization of the relaxases, ps51a and ps51b belong to the cole1 superfamily of mobilizable plasmids, commonly detected in enterobacteriaceae. the metallo-beta-lactamase gene was not identified in either ps51a or ps51b by homology search of the putative open reading frames. open reading frames encoded in ps51a include e. coli protein l-like, e. coli heat shock protein-like, and e. coli plasmid replication initiation protein-like, and those encoded in ps51b include helix-turn-helix protein-like, e. coli plasmid replication initiation protein-like, and salmonella replication initiation protein-like. these plasmids are stably maintained in one  strain of e. cloacae, thus, the encoded gene functions may confer growth advantage to the host cell.

TI  == carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae in finland: the first years (2008-11).
AB  == objectives: carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) are becoming a global problem; they are often resistant to nearly all available antibiotics. here we report details on all finnish cpe isolates found until the end of 2011: carbapenemase genes, travel history and multilocus sequence typing (mlst) data. methods: enterobacteriaceae sent to the antimicrobial resistance unit of the national institute for health and welfare were tested for susceptibility to carbapenems, screened for carbapenemases by pcr and isolates with decreased susceptibility to carbapenems were tested for hydrolysis of imipenem. carbapenemase-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were  typed by mlst. results: in all, 26 cpe strains were found from 25 patients: 10 with oxa-48-like enzymes, 5 with kpc, 4 with vim, 3 with ndm, 3 with imi/nmc-a and 1 with ges-14. the species were k. pneumoniae (n = 16), e. coli (n = 6), enterobacter cloacae (n = 3) and raoultella planticola (n = 1). of the 25 patients, 18 had a known travel history/hospital transfer from abroad. local spread/transmission was suspected in 2011, but there were no hospital outbreaks.  the k. pneumoniae multilocus sequence types st258, st182, st147, st244, st14, st13, st383, st101 and st15, and the e. coli sequence types st38 and st90 were found. many of these are global epidemic clones. conclusions: cpe strains are increasingly found in finland, but still at a very low prevalence.

TI  == kinetics and stereochemistry of hydrolysis of an n-(phenylacetyl)-alpha-hydroxyglycine ester catalyzed by serine beta-lactamases and dd-peptidases.
AB  == the alpha-hydroxydepsipeptide 3-carboxyphenyl n-(phenylacetyl)-alpha-hydroxyglycinate (5) is a quite effective substrate of serine beta-lactamases and low molecular mass dd-peptidases. the class c p99 and  ampc beta-lactamases catalyze the hydrolysis of both enantiomers of 5, although they show a strong preference for one of them. the class a tem-2 and class d oxa-1 beta-lactamases and the streptomyces r61 and actinomadura r39 dd-peptidases catalyze hydrolysis of only one enantiomer of at any significant rate. experiments show that all of the above enzymes strongly prefer the same enantiomer, a surprising result since beta-lactamases usually prefer l(s) enantiomers and dd-peptidases d(r). product analysis, employing peptidylglycine alpha-amidating lyase, showed that the preferred enantiomer is d(r). thus, it is  the beta-lactamases that have switched preference rather than the dd-peptidases.  molecular modeling of the p99 beta-lactamase active site suggests that the alpha-hydroxyl 5 of may interact with conserved asn and lys residues. both alpha-hydroxy and alpha-amido substituents on a glycine ester substrate can therefore enhance its productive interaction with the beta-lactamase active site, although their effects are not additive; this may also be true for inhibitors.

AB  == a strain of lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei bmk2005 isolated from healthy infant faeces has shown a remarkable antibacterial activity against 32 bacterial pathogenic strains of human clinical isolates. among them, 13 strains belonging to species of escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant to cefotaxime (ctx) and ceftazidime (caz), and 4 strains of staphylococcus aureus were resistant to methicillin (mrsa). this antibacterial activity was attributed to a bacteriocin designated as paracaseicin a. it was heat-stable up to 120 degrees c for 5 min and active within the ph range of 2-5.  its activity was lost when treated with proteases, which reveals its proteinaceous nature. this bacteriocin was successfully purified only by two steps of reversed phase chromatography. its molecular mass, determined by mass spectrometry analysis, was 2,462.5 da. to our knowledge, the present study is the first report on characterization and purification of a bacteriocin, produced by a l. paracasei subsp. paracasei strain exhibiting an antibacterial activity against various multidrug-resistant species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria,  which reveals its potential for use in prevention or treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant species especially in cases of antibiotics-associated diarrhea (aad).

AB  == the horizontal gene transfer of plasmid-determined stress tolerance was achieved  under lab conditions. bacterial isolates, enterobacter cloacae (dge50) and escherichia coli (dge57) were used throughout the study. samples were collected from contaminated marine water and soil to isolate bacterial strains having tolerance against heavy metals and antimicrobial agents. we have demonstrated plasmid transfer, from amp(+)cu(+)zn(-) strain (dge50) to amp(-)cu(-)zn(+) strain (dge57), producing amp(+)cu(+)zn(+) transconjugants (dge(tc50-->57)) and amp(+)cu(-)zn(+) transformants (dge(tf50-->57)). dge57 did not carry any plasmid, therefore, it can be speculated that zinc tolerance gene in dge57 is located on chromosome. dge50 was found to carry three plasmids, out of which two were transferred through conjugation into dge57, and only one was transferred through  transformation. plasmid transferred through transformation was one out of the two transferred through conjugation. through the results of transformation it was revealed that the genes of copper and ampicillin tolerance in dge50 were located  on separate plasmids, since only ampicillin tolerance genes were transferred through transformation as a result of one plasmid transfer. by showing transfer of plasmids under lab conditions and monitoring retention of respective phenotype via conjugation and transformation, it is very well demonstrated how multiple stress tolerant strains are generated in nature.

TI  == seasonality in gram-negative and healthcare-associated infections.
AB  == to assess seasonal variations in gram-negative and healthcare-associated infections (hcais), a literature search was performed with combinations of the keywords 'seasonality', 'seasonal variations', 'gram-negative bacilli', 'infections', 'nosocomial infections', and 'health care associated infections', to retrieve articles published in english in peer-reviewed journals from 1 january 1970 to 29 february 2012. seasonality was demonstrated for infections, mostly bloodstream infections (bsis), caused by acinetobacter spp., escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa, with higher rates of infection during the summer months in north america, europe, the  middle east, australia, and asia. correlations were observed between temperature  increase and rates of bsi for acinetobacter spp., p. aeruginosa, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae. a significant correlation between lower urinary tract infections and higher temperature and decreased relative humidity could explain the seasonality of some bsis. regarding hcai, seasonality is intrinsically present in most viral respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, because viruses are introduced into hospitals during seasonal community outbreaks. other  hcais subject to seasonal variations include surgical wound infections, with winter peaks in the usa and summer peaks in finland, central-line-associated bsis in haematology/oncology paediatric outpatients, and dialysis-associated peritonitis. in summary, seasonal variations have been shown for infections caused by many gram-negative bacilli, as well as for a few hcais, but many studies remain to be performed in order to better understand the mechanisms of these variations.

TI  == causative bacteria and antibiotic resistance in neonatal sepsis.
AB  == background: neonatal sepsis is characterised by bacteraemia and clinical symptoms caused by microorganisms and their toxic products. gram negative bacteria are the commonest causes of neonatal sepsis. the resistance to the commonly used antibiotics is alarmingly high. the major reason for emerging resistance against  antibiotics is that doctors often do not take blood cultures before starting antibiotics. we have carried out this study to find out various bacteria causing  neonatal sepsis and their susceptibility to antibiotics for better management of  neonatal sepsis. methods: a total of 130 neonates with sepsis who were found to be blood culture positive were taken in this study. culture/sensitivity was done, isolated organisms identified and their sensitivity/resistance was noted against  different antibiotics. data were arranged in terms of frequencies and percentage. results: out of 130 culture proven cases of neonatal sepsis, gram negative bacteria were found in 71 (54.6%) cases and gram positive bacteria in 59 (45.4%)  cases. staphylococcus aureus was the most common bacteria found in 35 (26.9%) cases followed by escherichia coli in 30 (23.1%) cases. acinetobacter species, staphylococcus epidermidis, klebseila, streptococci, enterobacter cloacae and morexella species were found in 17 (13.1%), 17 (13.1%), 13 (10%), 7 (5.4%), 6 (4.6%), and 5 (3.8%) cases respectively. in most of the cases causative organisms were found to be resistant to commonly used antibiotics like ampicillin, amoxicillin, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone (77.7%, 81.5%, 63.1%, and 66.9% respectively). there was comparatively less (56.9%) resistance to ceftazidime. gentamicin had resistance in 55.1% cases, while amikacin and tobramycin had relatively less resistance (17.4% and 34.8% cases respectively). quinolones and imipenem had relatively less resistance. vancomycin was found to be effective in  100% cases of staphylococcus group. conclusion: staphylococcus aureus are the most common gram positive bacteria and escherichia coli are the most common gram  negative bacteria causing neonatal sepsis. resistance to commonly used antibiotics is alarmingly increasing. continued surveillance is mandatory to assess the resistance pattern at a certain level.

TI  == the variability of bacterial aerosol in poultry houses depending on selected factors.
AB  == objectives: this study is aimed at evaluation of bacterial air contamination in intensive poultry breeding. the evaluation was based on the determined levels of  bacterial concentrations and qualitative identification of isolated microorganisms. materials and methods: the study covered 5 poultry houses: two hatcheries and three hen houses with the litter bed system. the air was sampled in three measurement series in the central part of the investigated workplace at  the height of about 1.5 m over the ground, using portable measuring sets consisting of a gilair 5 (sensidyne, usa) pump and a measuring head filled with a glass microfibre filter (whatman, uk). for the quantitative and qualitative analysis of microorganisms were used appropriate microbiological media. results:  the total concentrations of airborne mesophilic bacteria inside the poultry breeding houses ranged from 4.74 x 10(4) cfu/m(3) to 1.89 x 10(8) cfu/m(3). for gram-negative bacteria, the range comprised the values from 4.33 x 10(2) cfu/m(3) to 4.29 x 10(6) cfu/m(3). the concentrations of the cocci of enterococcus genus ranged from 1.53 x 10(4) cfu/m(3) to 1.09 x 10(7) cfu/m(3), whereas those of other gram-positive bacteria from 3.78 x 10(4) cfu/m(3) to 6.65 x 10(7) cfu/m(3). the lowest concentrations of each group of the examined microorganisms were noted in the second measurement series when the air exchange in the breeding houses was over twice higher than in first and third measurement series because the mechanical ventilation was supported by natural ventilation (opened gates in the  buildings). the lowest concentrations of total bacteria were obtained in those buildings where one-day old chickens were kept. gram-positive bacteria of the genera: staphylococcus, enterococcus, corynebacterium, brevibacterium, micrococcus, cellulomonas, bacillus, aerococcus, and gram-negative bacteria of the genera: pseudomonas, moraxella, escherichia, enterobacter, klebsiella, pasteurella, pantoea were isolated. it was shown that for most of the investigated livestock premises the total bacteria concentrations exceeded the reference value of 1.0 x 10(5) cfu/m(3). furthermore, pathogenic microorganisms which are a potential threat to human health (escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. ozaenae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus  faecium) were found among the identified bacteria. conclusions: the results indicate that the hygienic conditions of the working environment connected with litter bed system production of poultry are affected by changes of the efficiency of ventilation and create a direct health risk to employees. they should use personal protective measures to protect their respiratory tract, especially when  the gates in the hen houses are closed.

TI  == spread of an ompk36-modified st15 klebsiella pneumoniae variant during an outbreak involving multiple carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae species and clones.
AB  == we aim to characterise multiple ertapenem-resistant (ert-r, n = 15) enterobacteriaceae isolates identified as presumptive carbapenemase producers in  a portuguese hospital in a short period of time (march-july 2010). antibiotic susceptibility patterns, beta-lactamases, genetic relatedness [pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge), multi-locus sequence typing (mlst)], plasmid content and  major enterobacterial porins were investigated. ertapenem resistance was associated with deficiencies in major porins and, in some cases, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) or ampc beta-lactamase production among outbreak and non-outbreak clones. most isolates (n = 8) corresponded to two ert-r klebsiella pneumoniae st15 pfge-types: (i) a sporadic variant (kp-a-ert, n = 1) presenting a premature stop codon in ompk36 and (ii) an epidemic variant (kp-b-ert, n = 7) exhibiting a new ompk36 porin variant, which differed additionally in plasmid and antibiotic susceptibility profiles. st14 (n = 1) and  st45 (n = 1) k. pneumoniae, st131 (n = 1) and st354 (n = 1) escherichia coli, enterobacter asburiae (n = 1), enterobacter cloacae (n = 1) and enterobacter aerogenes (n = 1) ert-r clones were also sporadically detected. porin changes in  these isolates included non-sense mutations [ompk35, ompk36, ompf; minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) = 4-32 mg/l], is-mediated porin disruptions (ompk36, ompc; mic = 12->32 mg/l) or alterations in the l3 loop (ompk36; mic = 4-16 mg/l). we describe, for the first time in portugal, the simultaneous emergence of multiple ert-r enterobacteriaceae species and clones in a short period of time. moreover, our results support that a ctx-m-15-producing st15 k. pneumoniae with an ompk36-modified porin might successfully spread in the nosocomial setting.

TI  == nonrecovery of varying proportions of viable bacteria during spread plating governed by the extent of spreader usage and proposal for an alternate spotting-spreading approach to maximize the cfu.
AB  == aims: to elucidate the cause of high variations and inconsistencies in bacterial  cfu observed within and between different experiments while assessing viable bacterial counts through spread plating (sp). methods and results: following the  inconsistent results, cfu estimations were undertaken through conventional sp using the spreader, or a modified approach that did not use spreader employing four organisms. the latter approach involving spotting-and-tilt-spreading of inoculum on agar surface [spotting spreading (ss)] yielded higher cfu by 11-120%  over the weighted average depending on the organism and diluent. the adverse effect owing to the spreader was the most obvious in escherichia coli followed by staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter cloacae and bacillus pumilus. plate attributes that determined the surface moisture levels of agar medium and the spreading practice adopted by the personnel formed two other major influencing factors. plating for shorter periods (<60 s) using fresh 15/20 ml plates caused loss of 3-12% cfu owing to inoculum adhesion to spreader irrespective of glass or polypropylene make. on the other hand, prolonging the plating brought down the cfu significantly. spreader movement on agar surface subsequent to the exhaustion of free moisture, which was marked by the experiencing of some friction to smooth spreader movement, was detrimental to vegetative cells, while bacillus spores were less affected. conclusions: the study brings out that the way sp is carried  out exerts significant effects on cfu influenced by plate conditions. prolonged use of spreader on dry agar surface could be highly detrimental to bacterial cells. a mild use of spreader accounting for spreader-adhering inoculum or the practice of ss not involving the spreader is recommended. significance and impact of the study: this study unravels the effects owing to the spreader on bacterial  cells and the cfu and recommends an alternate approach of ss to minimize cfu inconsistencies and to maximize the viable bacterial counts.

AB  == background: platelet (plt) gels exhibit antimicrobial activity useful for wound healing. the nature of the antibacterial component(s) is unknown. study design and methods: plt-poor plasma (ppp), plt-rich plasma (prp), plt gel (pg), and solvent/detergent-treated plt lysate (s/d-pl) from two donors were evaluated either native or after complement heat inactivation. materials were spiked at a 10% ratio (vol/vol) with approximately 10(7-8) colony-forming units/ml with four  gram-positive and four gram-negative bacteria of the wound flora. bacterial count was determined by plate assays at time of spiking and after 3 and 48 hours at 31  degrees c. bacteria growth inhibition tests were also performed. results: there was no viable escherichia coli colony for 48 hours after spiking to the plasma and plt materials from both donors, corresponding to greater than 7.51 to greater than 9.05 log inactivation. pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus were inactivated (approx. 4.7, 7, and 2 log, respectively)  3 hours after spiking to prp, ppp, or s/d-pl from the first donor but less (1.1,  4.6, and 0.2 log, respectively) in pg, before a regrowth at 48 hours in all materials. similar data were obtained with the second donor. no plasma and plt material had antimicrobial activity against enterobacter cloacae, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, and staphylococcus epidermidis. complement-inactivated samples had no antimicrobial activity. conclusion: plasma complement is mostly responsible for the activity of plasma and plt biomaterials against e. coli, p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and s. aureus. activation of the coagulation to prepare pg may reduce antimicrobial activity. these findings may help optimize the control of wound infections by blood biomaterials.

AB  == objectives: to characterize uk clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae producing  oxa-48-like carbapenemases and to compare their resistance plasmids. methods: twenty-six enterobacteria producing oxa-48-like enzymes were studied. these were  from 22 diverse hospitals in the uk. isolates of escherichia coli and klebsiella  pneumoniae were assigned to clonal lineages by multilocus sequence typing. carbapenemase genes and their genetic environments were characterized by pcr and  sequencing. resistance plasmids were transferred by transformation or conjugation and compared by restriction analysis and pcr for genes encoding critical plasmid  functions. results: thirteen isolates of k. pneumoniae, 10 e. coli and 2 enterobacter cloacae harboured a classical bla(oxa-48) gene; the k. pneumoniae isolates belonged to 11 sequence types (sts) and the e. coli to 7 sts, including  st131 and st38. the bla(oxa-48) genes were located within either tn1999 or tn1999.2 transposons on related approximately 50 kb or approximately 62 kb plasmids, which lacked other resistance genes or, in one isolate, on an approximately 140 kb plasmid that also encoded oxa-9 and ctx-m group-9 beta-lactamases. one india-linked k. pneumoniae isolate had a bla(oxa-181) gene in association with an isecp1 insertion sequence on a 7 kb plasmid. conclusions:  horizontal transfer of related plasmids has facilitated the spread of oxa-48 carbapenemase into multiple strains of several enterobacteriaceae species. the clonal diversity of the producers suggests repeated introduction into the uk. low carbapenem mics for some producers complicates detection and creates a risk for unrecognized spread.

AB  == mobile drug-resistance genes with identical nucleic acid sequences carried by multidrug-resistant escherichia coli strains that cause community-acquired infections are becomingly increasingly dispersed worldwide. over a 2-year period, we analysed gram-negative bacterial (gnb) pathogens from the blood of inpatients  at an urban public hospital to determine what proportion of these isolates carried such globally dispersed drug-resistance genes. of 376 gnb isolates, 167 (44 %) were escherichia coli, 50 (13 %) were klebsiella pneumoniae, 25 (7 %) were pseudomonas aeruginosa, 25 (7 %) were proteus mirabilis and 20 (5 %) were enterobacter cloacae; the remainder (24 %) comprised 26 different gnb species. among e. coli isolates, class 1 integrons were detected in 64 (38 %). the most common integron gene cassette configuration was dfra17-aada5, found in 30 (25 %)  of 119 drug-resistant e. coli isolates and in one isolate of moraxella morganii.  extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) genes were found in 16 e. coli isolates (10 %). these genes with identical sequences were found in nearly 40 % of bloodstream e. coli isolates in the study hospital, as well as in a variety of bacterial species from clinical and non-clinical sources worldwide. thus, a substantial proportion of bloodstream infections among hospitalized patients were caused by e. coli strains carrying drug-resistance genes that are dispersed globally in a wide variety of bacterial species.

TI  == role of inchi2 plasmids harbouring blavim-1, blactx-m-9, aac(6')-ib and qnra genes in the spread of multiresistant enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae strains in different units at hospital vall d'hebron, barcelona, spain.
AB  == seven enterobacter cloacae isolates and seven klebsiella pneumoniae isolates harbouring a phenotype compatible with the production of a metallo-beta-lactamase were recovered between 2009 and 2011 in three intensive care units of hospital vall d'hebron (barcelona, spain). the presence of bla(vim), bla(imp), bla(ndm), bla(ctx-m), aac(6')-ib, qnra, qnrb and qnrs genes was screened by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and sequencing. clonal relatedness of the isolates was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and, in the case of k. pneumoniae isolates, by multilocus sequence typing (mlst). pcr-based replicon typing, southern hybridisation, plasmid double-locus sequence typing and mob relaxase classification methods were used to identify and characterise the plasmids carrying the resistance genes. transferability of the identified plasmids was tested by conjugation assays. all 14 isolates were found to carry bla(vim-1), bla(ctx-m-9) (except one isolate), aac(6')-ib and qnra genes. clonality assessment demonstrated that e. cloacae isolates were distributed in three clonal clusters, whereas all of the k. pneumoniae isolates belonged to one  unique clone, identified as sequence type st252. all studied isolates harboured a large conjugative inchi2 mob(h11) plasmid carrying all of the detected resistance genes. plasmid dna analysis showed that all of them belonged to the st1 inchi2 plasmid cluster and shared the same relaxase partial sequence. in conclusion, the present study describes the dissemination within a hospital of multiresistant e.  cloacae and k. pneumoniae isolates producing vim-1. a complex clonal epidemiology of the e. cloacae isolates was observed and plasmid dna analysis strongly supports horizontal exchanges of the same inchi2 plasmid between different strains and species.

TI  == use of intravesicular amikacin irrigations for the treatment and prophylaxis of urinary tract infections in a patient with spina bifida and neurogenic bladder: a case report.
AB  == this case report describes the use of intravesicular amikacin irrigations to treat and prevent urinary tract infections (utis) in a pediatric patient with spina bifida and neurogenic bladder. a 15 year old hispanic female was admitted for a uti caused by enterobacter cloacae and multiple-drug resistant pseudomonas  aeruginosa. a 7 day course of daily intravenous amikacin and ceftazidime was initiated along with twice daily intravesicular amikacin irrigations (15 mg/30 ml) with a dwell time of 2 hours. the patient improved and was discharged on prophylactic bactrim ss (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim) 1 tablet daily and intravesicular amikacin irrigations (15 mg/30 ml) once every other day. approximately 2 months after discharge, the patient developed another uti from multidrug resistant escherichia coli and was treated with a 14 day course of daily intravenous ciprofloxacin accompanied by daily intravesicular amikacin irrigations. adjunctive therapy with either once daily or twice daily intravesicular amikacin irrigations successfully treated the patient's uti. however, prophylactic treatment with intravesicular amikacin failed to prevent future utis in this patient.

TI  == a 9-year retrospective review of antibiotic cycling in a surgical intensive care  unit.
AB  == background: six years after initiating a monthly antibiotic cycling protocol in the surgical intensive care unit (sicu), we retrospectively reviewed antibiogram-derived sensitivities of predominant gram-negative pathogens before and after antibiotic cycling. we also examined susceptibility patterns in the medical intensive care unit (micu) where antibiotic cycling is not practiced. materials and methods: antibiotic cycling protocol was implemented in the sicu starting in 2003, with monthly rotation of piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem/cilastin, and ceftazidime. sicu antibiogram data from positive clinical  cultures for years 2000 and 2002 were included in the pre-cycling period, and those from 2004 to 2009 in the cycling period. results: profiles of sicu pseudomonal isolates before (n = 116) and after (n = 205) implementing antibiotic cycling showed statistically significant improvements in susceptibility to ceftazidime (66% versus 81%; p = 0.003) and piperacillin/tazobactam (75% versus 85%; p = 0.021), while susceptibility to imipenem remained unaltered (70% in each case; p = 0.989). susceptibility of e. coli isolates to piperacillin/tazobactam improved significantly (46% versus 83%; p < 0.0005), trend analysis showing this  improvement to persist over the study period (p = 0.025). similar findings were not observed in the micu. review of 2004-2009 antibiotic prescription practices showed monthly heterogeneity in the sicu, and a 2-fold higher prescribing of piperacillin/tazobactam in the micu (p < 0.0001). conclusions: six years into antibiotic cycling, we found either steady or improved susceptibilities of clinically relevant gram-negative organisms in the sicu. how much of this effect  is from cycling is unknown, but the antibiotic heterogeneity provided by this practice justifies its ongoing use.

TI  == characterization of beta-lactamase and porin mutants of enterobacteriaceae selected with ceftaroline + avibactam (nxl104).
AB  == objectives: ceftaroline + avibactam (nxl104) is a novel inhibitor combination active against enterobacteriaceae with class a and c beta-lactamases. we investigated its risk of mutational resistance. methods: single- and multi-step mutants were sought and characterized from enterobacteriaceae with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), ampc beta-lactamases and kpc beta-lactamases. results: overgrowth occurred on agar with low mic multiples of ceftaroline + avibactam, but frequencies for single-step mutants were <10(-9). most mutants were unstable, with only three remaining resistant on subculture. for one, from an ctx-m-15-positive escherichia coli, the ceftaroline + avibactam  mic was raised, but the organism had reduced resistance to ceftaroline and lost resistance to other oxyimino-cephalosporins, with this profile retained when the  mutant bla(ctx-m-15) was cloned into e. coli dh5alpha. sequencing identified a lys237gln substitution in the ctx-m-15 variant. the other two stable single-step  mutants were from an ampc-derepressed enterobacter cloacae strain; these had unaltered or slightly reduced resistance to other beta-lactams. both had amino acids 213-226 deleted from the omega loop of ampc. further stable mutants were obtained from ampc-inducible and -derepressed e. cloacae in multi-step selection, and these variously had reduced expression of ompc and ompf, and/or asn366his/ile substitutions in ampc. conclusions: stable resistant mutants were difficult to select. those from ampc-derepressed e. cloacae had porin loss or ampc changes, including omega loop deletions. a lys237gln substitution in ctx-m-15 conferred resistance, but largely abolished esbl activity.

TI  == antibacterial and antimycobacterial lignans and flavonoids from larrea tridentata.
AB  == three lignans and four flavonoids were isolated and characterized from larrea tridentata and compounds were tested against 16 bacterial species/strains. results showed that: dihydroguaiaretic acid (1) had activity towards methicillin  resistant (mr) staphylococcus aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) 50 microg/ml) and multidrug-resistant (mdr) strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis (mic 12.5-50 microg/ml); 4-epi-larreatricin (2) was active against enterobacter cloacae (mic 12.5 microg/ml), as well as sensitive (mic 50 microg/ml) and mdr strains of m. tuberculosis (mic 25 microg/ml). 3'-demethoxy-6-o-demethylisoguaiacin (3) displayed activity against sensitive and resistant s. aureus (mic 25 microg/ml), enterococcus faecalis (mic 12.5 microg/ml), escherichia coli (mic 50 microg/ml), e. cloacae (mic 12.5 microg/ml)  and mdr strains of m. tuberculosis (mic 12.5 microg/ml). 5,4'-dihydroxy-3,7,8,3'-tetramethoxyflavone (4) and 5,4'-dihydroxy-3,7,8-trimethoxyflavone (5) were active against m. tuberculosis mdr strains having mic values of 25 and 25-50 microg/ml, respectively, while 5,4'-dihydroxy-7-methoxyflavone (6) was active against s. aureus (mic 50 microg/ml) and e. faecalis (mic 50 microg/ml). we concluded that lignan 3 is the  main compound responsible for the antibacterial activity of l. tridentata. lignans 1 and 2 as well as flavonoid 6 contribute with some degree of antibacterial activity. on the other hand, compounds 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 contributed to the antimycobacterial activity found in l. tridentata.

TI  == pathogen identification with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy: the effect of  bacterial and biofluid specimen contamination.
AB  == in this paper, the potential use of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (libs) for the rapid discrimination and identification of bacterial pathogens in realistic clinical specimens is investigated. specifically, the common problem of sample contamination was studied by creating mixed samples to investigate the effect that the presence of a second contaminant bacterium in the specimen had on the libs-based identification of the primary pathogen. two closely related bacterial specimens, escherichia coli strain atcc 25922 and enterobacter cloacae  strain atcc 13047, were mixed together in mixing fractions of 10:1, 100:1, and 1000:1. libs spectra from the three mixtures were reliably classified as the correct e. coli strain with 98.5% accuracy when all the mixtures were withheld from the training model and classified against spectra from pure specimens. to simulate a rapid test for the presence of urinary tract infection pathogens, libs spectra were obtained from specimens of staphylococcus epidermidis obtained from  distilled water and sterile urine. libs spectra from the urine-harvested bacteria were classified as s. epidermidis with 100% accuracy when classified using a model containing only spectra from other staphylococci species and with 88.5% accuracy when a model containing five genera of bacteria was utilized. bacterial  specimens comprising five different genera and 13 classifiable taxonomic groups of species and strains were compiled in a library that was tested using external  validation techniques. the importance of utilizing external validation techniques where the library is tested with data withheld from all previous testing and training of the model was revealed by comparing the results against "leave-one-out" cross-validation results. last, the effect of using sequential models for the classification of a single unknown spectrum was investigated by comparing the misclassification of two closely related bacteria, e. coli and e. cloacae, when the classification was first performed using the five-genus bacterial library and then with a smaller model consisting only of e. coli and e. cloacae specimens. this result shows the utility of using successively more targeted analyses and models that use preliminary classifications from more general models as input.

TI  == fecal carriage of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae: a hidden reservoir  in hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients.
AB  == fecal carriage of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) has not been extensively investigated, except in the cases of selected patients at risk, mostly during outbreaks. a total of 1,100 fecal samples randomly collected in our institution in two different periods in 2006 (n = 600) and 2009-2010 (n = 500) from hospitalized (26.8%) and nonhospitalized (73.2%) patients were screened for  cpe. the first period coincided with an outbreak of vim-1-producing enterobacteriaceae, and the second one coincided with the emergence of kpc enzymes in our hospital. diluted samples in saline were cultured in luria-bertani broth with 1 mug/ml imipenem and subcultured in macconkey agar plates with 4 mug/ml ceftazidime. growing colonies were screened for cpe (modified hodge test and edta and boronic acid synergy tests). carbapenemase genes, plasmids in which  they are located, and clonal relatedness were determined. individuals who exhibited fecal carriage of cpe (11/1,043, 1.1%; 95% confidence interval [ci], 0.53 to 1.88) included 8 hospitalized (carriage rate, 2.9%; 95% ci, 1.24 to 5.55) and 3 nonhospitalized patients (carriage rate, 0.4%; 95% ci, 0.08 to 1.14), the latter being identified in 2009. eighty-two percent of colonized patients were not infected with cpe. isolates harboring bla(vim-1) with or without bla(shv-12)  were identified as klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 8; st39, st688, st253, and st163),  enterobacter cloacae (n = 3; two pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [pfge] types),  escherichia coli (n = 2; st155 and st2441), and citrobacter freundii (n = 1). some of these lineages had previously been detected in our institution. the bla(vim-1) gene was a member of the class 1 integrons in110 (bla(vim-1)-aaca4-aada1) and in113 (bla(vim-1)-aaca4-dhfrii) located on plasmids  incn (n = 11; 30 to 50 kb) and inchi2 (n = 3; 300 kb), respectively. dissemination of bla(vim-1) class-1 integrons within highly transferable plasmids in a polyclonal population has potentially contributed to the maintenance and spread of cpe.

AB  == objectives: to investigate the occurrence and characteristics of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates in clinical samples of companion animals and horses and compare the results with esbl/ampc-producing isolates described in humans. methods: between october 2007 and august 2009, 2700 enterobacteriaceae derived from clinical infections in companion animals and horses were collected. isolates displaying inhibition zones of </= 25 mm for ceftiofur and/or cefquinome by disc diffusion were included. esbl/ampc production was confirmed by combination disc tests. the  presence of resistance genes was identified by microarray, pcr and sequencing, escherichia coli genotypes by multilocus sequence typing and antimicrobial susceptibility by broth microdilution. results: sixty-five isolates from dogs (n  = 38), cats (n = 14), horses (n = 12) and a turtle were included. six enterobacteriaceae species were observed, mostly derived from urinary tract infections (n = 32). all except 10 isolates tested resistant to cefotaxime and ceftazidime by broth microdilution using clinical breakpoints. esbl/ampc genes observed were bla(ctx-m-1, -2, -9, -14, -15,) bla(tem-52), bla(cmy-2) and bla(cmy-)(39). bla(ctx-m-1) was predominant (n = 17). bla(ctx-m-9) occurred in combination with qnra1 in 3 of the 11 enterobacter cloacae isolates. twenty-eight different e. coli sequence types (sts) were found. e. coli carrying bla(ctx-m-1)  belonged to 13 sts of which 3 were previously described in dutch poultry and patients. conclusions: this is the first study among a large collection of dutch  companion animals and horses characterizing esbl/ampc-producing isolates. a similarity in resistance genes and e. coli sts among these isolates and isolates  from dutch poultry and humans may suggest exchange of resistance between different reservoirs.

TI  == functional consequence of covalent reaction of phosphoenolpyruvate with udp-n-acetylglucosamine 1-carboxyvinyltransferase (mura).
AB  == the enzyme mura has been an established antibiotic target since the discovery of  fosfomycin, which specifically inhibits mura by covalent modification of the active site residue cys-115. early biochemical studies established that cys-115 also covalently reacts with substrate phosphoenolpyruvate (pep) to yield a phospholactoyl adduct, but the structural and functional consequences of this reaction remained obscure. we captured and depicted the cys-115-pep adduct of enterobacter cloacae mura in various reaction states by x-ray crystallography. the data suggest that cellular mura predominantly exists in a tightly locked complex with udp-n-acetylmuramic acid (unam), the product of the murb reaction, with pep covalently attached to cys-115. the uniqueness and rigidity of this "dormant" complex was previously not recognized and presumably accounts for the failure of drug discovery efforts toward the identification of novel and effective mura inhibitors. we demonstrate that recently published crystal structures of mura from various organisms determined by different laboratories were indeed misinterpreted and actually contain unam and covalently bound pep. the cys-115-pep adduct was also captured in vitro during the reaction of free mura and substrate udp-n-acetylglucosamine or isomer udp-n-acetylgalactosamine. the now available series of crystal structures allows a comprehensive view of the reaction cycle of mura. it appears that the covalent reaction of mura with pep fulfills dual functions by tightening the complex with unam for the efficient feedback regulation of murein biosynthesis and by priming the pep molecule for instantaneous reaction with substrate udp-n-acetylglucosamine.

AB  == background: red cell exchange/transfusion is frequently used in the management of patients with medical complications related to acute severe sickle cell disease (scd). however, peripheral venous access is often difficult without central venous catheters (cvcs) in adult patients with moderate or severe scd. aims: to review our experience with the use of the port-a-cath((r)) device in sixteen patients with scd undergoing exchange or simple transfusions. methods: among a cohort of 550 patients who frequently visited the inpatient service, sixteen scd  patients required the insertion of a port-a-cath((r)) device. these patients included 3 males and 13 females, aged 25-44 years [31.1 +/- 2.3; mean +/- sd]. a  total of 24 port-a-cath((r)) devices were implanted in these 16 patients during the study period. eleven patients had 1 device implanted, three patients had 2 devices, one patient had 3 devices, and one patient had 4 devices implanted. results: out of the 24 devices implanted, 17 required removal, due to either infection associated with sepsis and/or thrombosis. the organisms involved were candida spp. (3), c. parapsilosis (2), c. albicans (1), c. famata (1), c. lusitanice (1), staphylococcus spp. (6), and s. aureus (3), as well as the coagulase-negative staphylococcus (2), alpha hemolytic streptococcus (1), diphtheroid bacilli (2), pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), ps. spp. (3), escherichia coli (3), klebsiella oxytoca (1), klebsiella pneumoniae (1), klebsiella spp. (1), serratia liquefaciens (1), serratia fanticola (1), achromobacter spp. (2) chromobacterium violaceum (1), delftia acidovirans (1), stenotrophomonas maltophile (1), alcaligenes faecalis (1), and enterobacter cloacae (1). two episodes of documented thrombosis were observed. one case presented with right atrial thrombosis/svc syndrome and the other case presented with left upper arm thrombosis. two patients died with ports in situ, while five patients had ports in place at the time of this study. the median working life of the ports was 688.5 days (range: 39-3925). the rate of infective complications was 2.63 infections per 1000 catheter days, and the number of infections was significantly correlated with the number of ports [pearson's r=0.66; p<0.01]. discussion: our results suggest that patients with scd suffer infective complications associated  with the port-a-cath((r)), which often necessitate its removal. although these devices are extremely useful, their optimal beneficial potential is only realized if the patients receive proper care at special centers well-versed in the maintenance of such devices by experienced staff.

AB  == this study aimed to evaluate the routine setting performance of a guideline for phenotypic detection of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in enterobacteriaceae, recommending esbl confirmation with etest or combination disc for isolates with a positive esbl screen test (i.e. cefotaxime and/or ceftazidime mic >1 mg/l or an automated system esbl warning). twenty laboratories submitted 443 enterobacteriaceae with a positive esbl screen test and their confirmation test result (74%escherichia coli, 12%enterobacter cloacae, 8%klebsiella pneumoniae, 3%proteus mirabilis, 2%klebsiella oxytoca). presence of esbl genes was used as reference test. accuracy of local phenotypic esbl detection was 88%.  the positive predictive value (ppv) of local screen tests was 70%, and differed per method (vitek-2: 69%, phoenix: 68%, disc diffusion: 92%), and species (95%k.  pneumoniae-27%k. oxytoca). a low ppv (3%) was observed for isolates with automated system alarm but third-generation cephalosporin mics <2 mg/l. local esbl confirmation had a ppv and negative predictive value (npv) of 93% and 90%, respectively. compared with centrally performed confirmation tests, 7% of local tests were misinterpreted. combination disc was more specific than etest (91% versus 61%). confirmation tests were not reliable for p. mirabilis and k. oxytoca (ppv 33% and 38%, respectively, although npvs were 100%). in conclusion, performance of etests could be enhanced by education of technicians to improve their interpretation, by genotypic esbl confirmation of p. mirabilis and k. oxytoca isolates with positive phenotypic esbl confirmation, and by interpreting  isolates with a positive esbl alarm but an mic <2 mg/l for cefotaxime and ceftazidime as esbl-negative.

TI  == antimicrobial peptide gene induction, involvement of toll and imd pathways and defense against bacteria in the red flour beetle, tribolium castaneum.
AB  == using tribolium castaneum, we quantitatively investigated the induction of nine antimicrobial peptide (amp) genes by live gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae), gram-positive bacteria (micrococcus luteus and bacillus subtilis) and the budding yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae). then, five representative amp genes were selected, and the involvement of the toll and imd pathways in their induction by e. coli, m. luteus and s. cerevisiae was examined  by utilizing rna interference of either myd88 or imd. results indicated: robust and acute induction of three genes by the two bacterial species was mediated mainly by the imd pathway; slow and sustained induction of one gene by the two bacteria was mediated mainly by the toll pathway; induction of the remaining one  gene by the two bacteria was mediated by both pathways; induction of the five genes by the yeast was mediated by the toll and/or imd pathways depending on respective genes. these results suggest that more promiscuous activation and usage of the two pathways may occur in t. castaneum than in drosophila melanogaster. in addition, the imd pathway was revealed to dominantly contribute  to defense against two bacterial species, gram-negative e. cloacae and gram-positive b. subtilis that possesses dap-type peptidoglycan.

TI  == molecular characterization of ndm-1 producing enterobacteriaceae isolates in singapore hospitals.
AB  == objective: in this study, we molecularly characterized 12 ndm-1 producing clinical enterobacteriaceae (klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae) isolates that were part of a collection of non-carbapenem susceptible isolates obtained during a one-year period. these isolates were obtained from four local general hospitals in singapore. methods: polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays and sequencing was used to determine the presence of  beta-lactamase encoding genes (bla) including bla ndm-1 and plasmid-mediated quinolone and aminoglycoside resistance determinants. conjugation experiments were performed to determine the transferability of bla ndm-1. isolate relatedness was determined by multilocus sequence typing (mlst). results: the isolates were completely resistant to the second- and third-generation cephalosporins tested as well as carbapenems. susceptibility profiling of the isolates indicated that 100% retained susceptibility to tigecycline while 11/12 (91.7%) were susceptible to colistin. the bla ndm-1 gene was encoded on plasmids that were easily transferable. none of the patients had a travel history to countries where ndm-1  has been reported. the isolates appear clonally unrelated with mlst, revealing a  diversity of clonal types among the klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli isolates. conclusion: the ease of ndm-1 plasmid transmissibility may help their dissemination among the enterobacteriaceae. although it appears that the isolates are clonally unrelated, epidemiological links cannot be fully excluded without further research.

TI  == multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections after liver transplantation - spectrum and risk factors.
AB  == objectives: gram-negative bacilli infections, especially multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli infections, are the leading cause of high mortality after liver transplantation. this study sought to investigate the type of infection, infection rate, pathogenic spectrum, antibiotic-resistance profile, risk factors, and epidemiology of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infection. methods: a retrospective cohort study was conducted and data of 217 liver transplant patients receiving cadaveric livers between january 2007 and april 2010 were analyzed. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by minimum inhibitory concentration test. extended-spectrum and metallo-beta-lactamase assays were used to analyze beta-lactamase-produced isolates, and repetitive-sequence polymerase chain reaction was used to differentiate bacterium subspecies. results: sixty-seven isolates of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria were isolated from 66 infected liver transplant patients. stenotrophomonas maltophilia (100%, 8/8), klebsiella pneumoniae (61.5%, 8/13), enterobacter cloacae (75%, 3/4) and escherichia coli (81.3%, 13/16) were the most common extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacilli. metallo-beta-lactamase expressing isolates were identified as s. maltophilia (100%, 8/8), pseudomonas aeruginosa (83.3%, 5/6), acinetobacter baumannii (95%, 19/20). significant independent risk factors for multidrug-resistant gram-negative infection were extended use of pre-transplant broad-spectrum antibiotics (or 9.027, p=0.001) and prolonged (>==72h) endotracheal intubation (or 3.537, p=0.033). conclusions: to reduce the risk of acquiring mdr gram-negative bacillus infections after liver transplant, control measures are required to limit the use of prophylactic antibiotic in preventing infection during liver transplant and to shorten endotracheal intubation time.

TI  == enhanced antibacterial activities of leonuri herba extracts containing silver nanoparticles.
AB  == we report an efficient and powerful green process to enhance the antibacterial activities of the leonuri herba extract. plant sources, especially leaves and herbs, are precious for the generation of gold and silver nanoparticles. various  kinds of polyphenols and hydroxyl groups are capable of processing a reduction reaction to generate metals from its corresponding salts. we have prepared gold and silver nanoparticles with 70% ethanol and water extracts. no other toxic chemicals were utilized and the extracts played dual roles as reducing and stabilizing agents. for the generation of nanoparticles, both oven incubation and autoclaving methods were applied and the reaction conditions were optimized. surface plasmon resonance band indicated that the formation of nanoparticles was  successful. images of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed mostly spherical nanoparticles ranging from 9.9 to 13.0 nm in size. a water extract containing silver nanoparticles exhibited remarkable (approximately 127-fold) enhancement in antibacterial activities against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae when compared with the water extract alone. in addition, antibacterial activity towards gram-negative bacteria was greater than that against gram-positive bacteria. the process reported here has the potential to be a new approach to improve the antibacterial activities of plant extracts.

TI  == effects of clinical breakpoint changes in clsi guidelines 2010/2011 and eucast guidelines 2011 on antibiotic susceptibility test reporting of gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to analyse the effects of clinical breakpoint changes in clsi 2010 and 2011 guidelines and eucast 2011 guidelines on antibiotic susceptibility testing (ast) reports. methods: in total, 3713 non-duplicate clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and acinetobacter baumannii were analysed. inhibition zone diameters were determined for beta-lactams, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. clsi 2009-11 and eucast 2011 clinical breakpoints were applied. results: changes in resistance as defined per the guidelines affected individual species and drug classes differently. the cefepime resistance rate in escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae increased from 2.1% and 1.3% to 8.2% and 6.9%, respectively, applying clsi 2009-11 versus eucast 2011 guidelines. ertapenem resistance rates in e. cloacae increased from 2.6% with clsi 2009 to 7.2% for clsi 2010 and 2011, and to 10.1% when applying eucast 2011. cefepime and meropenem resistance rates in p. aeruginosa increased from 12.2% and 20.6% to 19.8% and 27.7%, respectively, comparing clsi 2009-11 with eucast 2011. tobramycin and gentamicin resistance rates in a. baumannii increased from 15.9% and 25.4% to 34.9% and 44.4% applying  clsi 2009-11 versus eucast 2011. conclusions: higher resistance rates reported due to breakpoint changes in clsi and eucast guidelines will result in increasing numbers of gram-negative bacilli reported as multidrug resistant. ast reports classifying amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefepime or carbapenem resistance will lead clinicians to use alternative agents. upon implementation of the eucast guidelines, laboratories should be aware of the implications of modified drug susceptibility testing reports on antibiotic prescription policies.

TI  == chromate-resistance genes in plasmids from antibiotic-resistant nosocomial enterobacterial isolates.
AB  == the presence of chromate-resistance genes in enterobacteria was evaluated in a collection of 109 antibiotic-resistant nosocomial isolates from nine major cities in mexico. results were compared with the presence of mercury-resistance genes. susceptibility tests showed that 21% of the isolates were resistant to chromate (cr(r)), whereas 36% were resistant to mercury (hg(r)). cr(r) levels were high in klebsiella pneumoniae (61%), low in enterobacter cloacae (12%) and escherichia coli (4%), and null in salmonella sp. isolates. colony hybridization demonstrated that the majority of metal-resistant isolates hybridized with chra gene (87% of cr(r) isolates), encoding a chr transporter homologue, and mera gene (74% of hg(r) isolates), encoding mera mercuric reductase, suggesting that most isolates  expressed these widespread metal-resistance systems. southern blot hybridization  of cr(r) isolates showed that plasmids of 80, 85, and 95 kb from k. pneumoniae isolates, and of 100 kb from an e. cloacae isolate, contained chra-related sequences. these plasmids belonged to incn or incp incompatibility groups, and conferred cr(r), as well as multiple antibiotic resistance, when transferred by conjugation to an e. coli standard strain. these data indicated that cr(r) genes  may be distributed among clinical enterobacteria via conjugative plasmids, probably by coselection with antibiotic-resistant genes.

TI  == [investigation of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from cystic fibrosis patients].
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa which is widely found in the environment, may lead to serious nosocomial infections. due to its intrinsic resistance to many antibacterial agents, treatment of p.aeruginosa infections usually present difficulty. quinolones, especially ciprofloxacin, are crutial antibiotics for the treatment of p.aeruginosa infections. however resistance developing to quinolones may become an important problem. resistance to quinolones is often a result of chromosomal mutations and by the effect of efflux pumps. recently plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance have been reportedin the members of enterobacteriaceae family. the gene responsible for this resistance is called qnr. in addition to qnr genes there is also another gene called aac(6)-ib-cr responsible for plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance and aminoglycoside resistance. limited studies which to screen p.aeruginosa strains for the presence of qnr gene region, revealed no positivity. the aim of this study was to investigate the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance in p.aeruginosa strains isolated from cystic fibrosis patients. a total of 110 p.aeruginosa strains isolated from respiratory tract specimens from the patients were included in the  study. ciprofloxacin susceptibilities of the isolates were detected by kirby-bauer disk diffusion method according to clsi guidelines. the presence of qnra, qnrb, qnrc, qnrs and aac(6')-ib-cr genes were searched by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with the use of specific individual primer pairs. as positive control strains, escherichia coli j53 pmg252 (qnra1 positive), e.coli j53 pmg252 (qnrs1 positive), e.coli j53 pmg258 (qnrb1 and aac(6')-ib-cr positive), klebsiella pneumoniae ref.15 (qnrb positive), enterobacter cloacae ref.287 (qnrs positive), e.coli ref.20 (qnra positive) and e.coli dh10 conjugated with phs11 plasmid (qnrc positive) were used. of 110 p.aeruginosa clinical isolates, 13 were found resistant to ciprofloxacin, while 7 were intermediate. however multiplex pcr yielded no positivity in terms of qnra, qnrb, qnrc, qnrs and aac(6')-ib-cr gene regions. in conclusion, although our results indicated that none of the tested p.aeruginosa strains harboured those genes, further multicenter studies with large numbers of isolates are needed to confirm these results.

TI  == group iic intron with an unusual target of integration in enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == a potential role of group iic-attc introns in integron gene cassette formation, that is, the way in which they could provide the attc sequence essential for recombination, has been proposed. group iic introns usually target the attc site  of gene cassettes and more specifically their inverse core. here we characterized a novel group iic intron targeting the core site of the aada1 gene cassette attc  site (aada1-qacedelta1 gene cassette junction) from enterobacterial isolates. intron mobility (retrohoming) was analyzed using a two-plasmid assay performed in escherichia coli. intron mobility assays confirmed the mobilization-integration of the group ii intron into the core site of the aada2, bla(vim-2), bla(carb-2),  aac(6')-ib, dfrxvb, arr2, cmla4, and aadb gene cassettes but not into the atti site. this mobility was dependent on maturase activity. reverse transcriptase pcr showed that this intron was transcriptionally active, and an intermediate circular form was detected by inverse pcr. this element was linked to the bla(veb-1) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene in a high number of enterobacterial isolates. a phylogenetic tree showed that the identified element  was located in a branch separate from group iic-attc introns, being an iic intron possessing the ability to integrate using the core site of the attc sites as target.

TI  == urinary tract infections in the early posttransplant period after liver transplantation: etiologic agents and their susceptibility.
AB  == background: we performed an analysis of etiologic agents for urinary tract infections in the early posttransplant period after orthotopic liver transplantation (olt) in adult recipients. patients and methods: the study covered the first 4 weeks after olt of 190 patients from september 2001 to the end of 2007. immunosuppression consisted of steroids and tacrolimus. antimicrobial prophylaxis was piperacillin/tazobactam, fluconazole, and sbd. urine samples were cultured to identify microorganisms in accord with standard microbiological procedures and to test susceptibility using clinical laboratory and standards institute guidelines. results: urine specimens (n=539) examined from 185 recipients (97.4%) showed 210 microbial strains. the most common were gram-negative (n=131; 62.4%) with predominance of escherichia coli (28.2%), enterobacter cloacae (19.1%), and acinetobacter baumannii (11.4%). extended-spectrum beta- lactamases (esbl(+)) strains were isolated in 38.5% of cases. gram-positive bacteria comprised 28.6% (n=60): the most common strains were enterococci (85% including hlar 80.4% and vre 17.6%] and staphylococci 11.8% [mrsa/mrcns; 100%]. there were 19 (9%) fungal strains. conclusions: in general, the identification in urine samples of multi-drug-resistant bacterial and fungal  strains in patients after olt such as esbl(+) 38.5%; hlar 80.4%; vre 17.6%; and mrsa/mrcns 100% requires better infection control.

TI  == clinical pharmacokinetics of meropenem and biapenem in bile and dosing considerations for biliary tract infections based on site-specific pharmacodynamic target attainment.
AB  == the present study investigated the pharmacokinetics of meropenem and biapenem in  bile and estimated their pharmacodynamic target attainment at the site. meropenem (0.5 g) or biapenem (0.3 g) was administered to surgery patients (n = 8 for each  drug). venous blood samples and hepatobiliary tract bile samples were obtained at the end of infusion (0.5 h) and for up to 5 h thereafter. drug concentrations in  plasma and bile were analyzed pharmacokinetically and used for a monte carlo simulation to predict the probability of attaining the pharmacodynamic target (40% of the time above the mic). both drugs penetrated similarly into bile, with  mean bile/plasma ratios of 0.24 to 0.25 (maximum drug concentration) and 0.30 to  0.38 (area under the drug concentration-time curve). the usual regimens of meropenem (0.5 g every 8 h [q8h]) and biapenem (0.3 g q8h) (0.5-h infusions) achieved similar target attainment probabilities in bile (>/= 90%) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae isolates. however, against pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, meropenem at 1 g q8h and biapenem at 0.6 g q8h were required for values of 80.7% and 71.9%, respectively.  the biliary pharmacodynamic-based breakpoint (the highest mic at which the target attainment probability in bile was >/= 90%) was 1 mg/liter for 0.5 g q8h and 2 mg/liter for 1 g q8h for meropenem and 0.5 mg/liter for 0.3 g q8h and 1 mg/liter  for 0.6 g q8h for biapenem. these results help to define the clinical pharmacokinetics of the two carbapenems in bile while also helping to rationalize and optimize the dosing regimens for biliary tract infections based on site-specific pharmacodynamic target attainment.

AB  == (2s,3s)-2,3-butanediol ((2s,3s)-2,3-bd) is a crucial chiral compound that acts as an excellent building block in asymmetric synthesis of highly valuable chiral compounds. however, the low concentration and optical purity of (2s,3s)-2,3-bd produced in previous studies limited its applications. in the present work, the gene encoding 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase from an enterobacter cloacae ssp. dissolvens strain sdm was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. whole cells of the recombinant e. coli was used to produce (2s,3s)-2,3-bd from diacetyl. under optimal conditions, high-optical-purity (2s,3s)-2,3-bd (purity >99%) was obtained with concentrations of 16.1 g l(-1) and 26.8 g l(-1) in batch and fed-batch conversions, respectively. thus, the process might be a promising alternative for the production of (2s,3s)-2,3-bd.

TI  == rectal carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacilli in community settings in madagascar.
AB  == background: extended-spectrum ss-lactamase-producing enterobacteria (esbl-pe) emerged at the end of the 1980s, causing nosocomial outbreaks and/or hyperendemic situations in hospitals and long-term care facilities. in recent years, community-acquired infections due to esbl-pe have spread worldwide, especially across developing countries including madagascar. objectives: this study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of intestinal carriage of esbl-pe in the community of antananarivo. methods: non-hospitalized patients were recruited  in three health centers in different socio economic settings. fresh stool collected were immediately plated on drigalski agar containing 3 mg/liter of ceftriaxone. gram-negative bacilli species were identified and esbl production was tested by a double disk diffusion (cefotaxime and ceftazidime +/- clavulanate) assay. characterization of esbls were perfomed by pcr and direct sequencing. molecular epidemiology was analysed by rep-pcr and eric-pcr. results: 484 patients were screened (sex ratio = 1.03, median age 28 years). 53 esbl-pe were isolated from 49 patients (carrier rate 10.1%). the isolates included escherichia coli (31), klebsiella pneumoniae (14), enterobacter cloacae (3), citrobacter freundii (3), kluyvera spp. (1) and pantoae sp. (1). in multivariate  analysis, only the socioeconomic status of the head of household was independently associated with esbl-pe carriage, poverty being the predominant risk factor. conclusions: the prevalence of carriage of esbl in the community of  antananarivo is one of the highest reported worldwide. this alarming spread of resistance genes should be stopped urgently by improving hygiene and streamlining the distribution and consumption of antibiotics.

TI  == emmdr, a new member of the mate family of multidrug transporters, extrudes quinolones from enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == we cloned a gene, ecl_03329, from the chromosome of enterobacter cloacae atcc13047, using a drug-hypersensitive escherichia coli kam32 cell as the host. we show here that this gene, designated as emmdr, is responsible for multidrug resistance in e. cloacae. e. coli kam32 host cells containing the cloned emmdr gene (kam32/pemmdr28) showed decreased susceptibilities to benzalkonium chloride, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, ethidium bromide, acriflavine, rhodamine6g, and trimethoprim. emmdr-deficient e. cloacae cells (ecdeltaemmdr) showed increased susceptibilities to several of the antimicrobial agents tested.  emmdr has twelve predicted transmembrane segments and some shared identity with members of the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (mate) family of transporters. study of the antimicrobial agent efflux activities revealed that emmdr is an h+-drug antiporter but not a na+ driven efflux pump. these results indicate that emmdr is responsible for multidrug resistance and pumps out quinolones from e. cloacae.

TI  == molecular characteristics of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae from the philippines.
AB  == beta-lactamases, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) and ampc beta-lactamases, are major resistance mechanisms of enterobacteriaceae. emergence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (pmqr) determinants in esbl-producing isolates poses a global threat. the molecular characterisitcs of esbl and pmqr determinants in the philippines are not well characterized. in this study, we investigated esbls and ampc beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae from the philippines, and analyzed the association between esbl and pmqr genes. a total of 91 amoxicilin non-susceptible enterobacteriaceae  were collected at the research institute for tropical medicine of the philippines from 2006 to 2008. ampc- or esbl-producing isolates were screened by detecting a  zone diameter for cefoxitin </= 14 mm or cefpodoxime </= 20 mm, respectively. possible esbl-producing strains were assessed by the esbl confirmation test of the clinical and laboratory standards institute. pcr and sequencing were performed to detect the esbl and pmqr genes. the number of esbl-producers and ampc-producers confirmed phenotypically was 17 (18.7%) and 61 (67.0%), respectively. of 17 phenotypic esbl-producers, 14 isolates had esbl genes, including 6 of escherichia coli, 3 of enterobacter cloacae, 2 of enterobacter aerogenes, 2 of klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1 of klebsiella ozaenae. among these isolates, there were 13, 4, and 12 with bla(ctx-m), bla(shv), and bla(tem), respectively. of the bla(ctx-m)-positive isolates, bla(ctx-m-15) shows the highest prevalence, followed by bla(ctx-m-3) and bla(ctx-m-14). of 14 esbl-producers identified by pcr, 4, 6, and 7 isolates were positive for qnrb, qnrs, and aac(6')-ib-cr, respectively. the frequency of aac(6')-ib-cr positivity  was significantly higher among ctx-m-15-producing isolates. thus, we identified bla(ctx-m), aac(6')-ib-cr, and qnr in esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae from the  philippines, and revealed a significant association between bla(ctx-m-15) and aac(6')-ib-cr. local epidemiological data are important for implementing appropriate antimicrobial therapy and effective infection control measures. continuous monitoring of antimicrobial resistance genes in the philippines will be required.

TI  == mucosal surveillance cultures in predicting gram-negative late-onset sepsis in neonatal intensive care units.
AB  == this study aimed to examine the spectrum and time course of gut and nasopharyngeal colonization with gram-negative micro-organisms, and to define the value of surveillance cultures in predicting late-onset sepsis in neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care units. nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs were collected on admission and twice weekly thereafter in 278 neonates admitted within the first 72 h of life with risk factors of early-onset sepsis. sterile body fluid cultures were obtained on admission and subsequently as clinically indicated. approximately half of the rectal (693/1250, 55%) and nasopharyngeal (558/1153, 48%) samples but only 6% (32/555) of the sterile fluid samples in 26 patients were culture positive for gram-negative organisms. in total, 2108 invasive and mucosal culture pairs were analysed. the overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of a mucosal sample to predict late-onset sepsis were 27%, 66%, 4% and 94%, respectively. patients with  pre-existing colonization with klebsiella pneumoniae (p = 0.011), klebsiella oxytoca (p = 0.002), escherichia coli (p = 0.003), stenotrophomonas spp. (p = 0.003) and pseudomonas spp. (p </= 0.001) were more likely to develop late-onset  sepsis. no such association was found for acinetobacter baumannii, serratia spp.  or enterobacter cloacae. in conclusion, routine mucosal cultures are inefficient  for the prediction of gram-negative late-onset sepsis in neonatal intensive care  units. however, targeted screening for specific organisms in an outbreak (e.g. klebsiella spp., e. coli, stenotrophomonas spp. and pseudomonas spp.) may offer an opportunity to improve infection control measures and enable timely initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibilities of commonly encountered bacterial isolates to fosfomycin determined by agar dilution and disk diffusion methods.
AB  == we studied the antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against 960 strains of commonly encountered bacteria associated with urinary tract infection using standard agar dilution and disk diffusion methods. species studied included 3 common species of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia; methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus; and vancomycin-susceptible and resistant enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. mics and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted in accordance with both the currently recommended clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) criteria for urinary tract isolates of escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) criteria for enterobacteriaceae. tentative zone diameter interpretive criteria were developed for species not currently published by clsi or eucast. escherichia coli was uniformly susceptible to fosfomycin, as were most strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. a. baumannii was resistant to fosfomycin, while the prevalence of resistance in p. aeruginosa and s. maltophilia was greatly affected by the choice of mic breakpoint. new tentative zone diameter criteria for k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, s. aureus, and e. faecium were able to be set, providing some interim laboratory guidance for disk diffusion until further breakpoint evaluations are undertaken by clsi and eucast.

TI  == comparative activity of tigecycline and tetracycline on gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria revealed by a multicentre study in four north european countries.
AB  == background: this study involves a multicentre surveillance of tigecycline and tetracycline activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria from primary care centres (pccs), general hospital wards (ghws) and intensive care units (icus) in denmark (n = 9), finland (n = 10), norway (n = 7) and sweden (n = 19). methods: the hospitals were each asked to test 30 consecutive gram-positive  and 30 gram-negative clinical isolates. supportive information accompanying each  isolate included the study centre, ward level (pcc, ghw, or icu), patient identification and source of the isolate. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) for tetracycline and tigecycline were determined with the etest. results:  the isolates collected comprised 1610 gram-negative and 1767 gram-positive clinical isolates. the study showed low rates of non-susceptibility (intermediate (i) and resistant (r)) to tigecycline: <1% in escherichia coli, though other enterobacteriaceae showed higher rates (enterobacter cloacae (7%), klebsiella pneumoniae (9%) and serratia spp. (23%)). the overall non-susceptibility rate for tigecycline in enterobacteriaceae with species-related breakpoints for tigecycline was 6% (4% excluding serratia spp.). the activity of tigecycline against haemophilus influenzae and acinetobacter spp. was high with a mic(50) of  0.25 mg/l and mic(90) of 1 mg/l. the prevalence of non-susceptibility to tigecycline among gram-positive bacteria was <1%. the corresponding figure for tetracycline was 14%. the activity of tigecycline against streptococcus pneumoniae was high with mic(50) and mic(90) of 0.125 mg/l. conclusion: tigecycline showed good overall in vitro activity against gram-positive and gram-negative isolates, including both tetracycline-susceptible and resistant isolates. most non-susceptibility to tigecycline among enterobacteriaceae other than e. coli was i (6%), rather than r (<1%). this indicates a problem setting interpretive species-related tigecycline breakpoints for enterobacteriaceae other than e. coli.

TI  == [validity of using imipenem as a representative carbapenems and levofloxacin as a representative fluoroquinolones in antibiotics susceptibility test for enterobacteriaceae].
AB  == in antimicrobial susceptibility test for enterobacteriaceae, the efficacies of carpapenems are predicted by the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of imipenem, and that of fluoroquinolones are predicted by the mic of levofloxacin.  to assess its judgement, we compared the mics of imipenem, meropenem, panipenem,  and doripenem for carbapenems, and ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tosufloxacin and  pazufloxacin for fluoroquinolones of clinically isolated enterobacteria, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae and citrobacterfreundii, those resistant to the third generation cephalosporin. mic distributions in low concentration range are estranged in some strains, conspicuously s. marcescens, e. cloacae and c. freundii: meropenem and doripenem displayed low mic value than imipenem and panipenem. since the estrangements are appeared mic value of less than 8 microg/ml, the interpretive results (susceptible, intermediate, resistant) are not affected. in fluoroquinolones, all 4 agents showed almost identical mic distributions, thus the mic of levofloxacin is accepted to use the reference for  other fluoroquinolones. the existence of the strains harboring carbapenem-resistant gene displaying low mic value of carbapenems was reported. for the sensitive detection of the candidate of carbapenem-resistant strains, cut-off value of each carbapenem should be reconsidered, and also other phonotype analysis should be applied. genomic analysis also would be required to detect the carbapenem-resistant gene.

TI  == pharmacokinetics of free ertapenem in critically ill septic patients: intermittent versus continuous infusion.
AB  == background: the aim of this paper was to compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (pk/pd) parameters of continuous (ci) and intermittent infusion (iti) of ertapenem into critically ill patients with severe abdominal infections. methods: twenty septic patients hospitalized in a university hospital intensive care unit were enrolled in the study. half of the patients received ertapenem as  an iti 1 g bolus once daily, and the other half of the patients received the same dose via ci over 24 h following a 1-g loading dose. blood was drawn 1, 12 and 24  h after terminating iti or on days 2, 3 and 5 after starting ci for each patient. after centrifugation, the drawn blood was frozen at -80 degrees c until being examined by high-performance liquid-chromatography analysis. results: median serum-free ertapenem concentrations were as follows: fcmax = 98.9 mg/l and fcmin  = 2.5 mg/l for iti, and fcss=15.9 mg/l for ci. the iti and ci median total clearance and volumes of distribution were 2.2 l/h vs. 2.5 l/h and 15.4 l vs. 21.0 l, respectively. the ertapenem mic ranges were as follows: escherichia coli  (0.006 to 0.5 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (0.023 to 0.5 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.023 to 0.5 mg/l), staphylococcus aureus (0.38 to 3 mg/l), streptococcus viridians (0.38 to 3 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (0.38 to 3 mg/l). iti and ci provided steady-state serum-free ertapenem concentrations constantly above the mic for all bacteria. conclusion: ertapenem exhibited satisfactory pk/pd parameters and achieved serum-free concentrations 100% of the time, above even the high mic of extracellular pathogens normally encountered during severe abdominal infections. ci administration resulted in equally effective pk/pd parameters as iti in normal weight, good renal-function patients.

TI  == bla(kpc) rna expression correlates with two transcriptional start sites but not always with gene copy number in four genera of gram-negative pathogens.
AB  == klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (kpc)-producing organisms are therapeutically and diagnostically challenging. it is possible that bla(kpc) gene expression plays a role in the variability observed in clinical susceptibility testing. bla(kpc) transformants together with 10 clinical isolates representing four genera were evaluated for bla(kpc) copy number and gene expression and correlated with beta-lactam mic data. the data suggest that mechanisms other than gene copy  number and expression of bla(kpc) contribute to variability in susceptibility when testing kpc-producing isolates.

TI  == bile bacterial flora and its in vitro resistance pattern in patients with acute cholangitis resulting from choledocholithiasis.
AB  == introduction: cholangitis and biliary sepsis are severe infectious diseases, which are often observed in patients with choledocholithiasis. the antimicrobial  therapy is effective if started as soon as the diagnosis is made. therefore, the  profile of bile pathogens and its susceptibility to a number of antibiotics were  evaluated. material and methods: bile cultures and antibiograms from 92 patients  hospitalized between january 2006 and december 2008 in a tertiary referral center for the treatment of biliary and pancreatic diseases (central teaching hospital,  medical university of silesia) were reviewed. specimens were obtained from patients with acute cholangitis and confirmed choledocholithiasis during endoscopic (i.e. ercp) and surgical (i.e. percutaneus transhepatic biliary drainage) procedures. the bile specimens were examined for pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and fungi. results: sixty-five of 92 analyzed cultures were positive. a total of 69 pathogens were isolated: 47 (68.1%) gram-negative bacteria, 18 (26.1%) gram-positive bacteria, 2 (2.9%) anaerobes and 2 (2.9%) candida. the predominant gram-negative pathogens were escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumani complex, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. the most effective antibiotics against gram-negative bacteria were imipenem, cefoperazone/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam and cefepime (susceptibility 97.9%, 89.4%, 85.1% and 85.1%, respectively). the expenditure on antibiotics monotherapies and combined therapies was also analyzed. conclusion: our study shows that gram-negative bacteria were the predominant bile pathogens found in patients with acute cholangitis. piperacillin/tazobactam or ceftazidime may be the alternative to ciprofloxacin therapeutic option. the addition of ticarcillin/clavulanic acid to ciprofloxacin could also be considered. however, imipenem should remain a back-up antibiotic in the treatment of acute cholangitis.

AB  == the product of the aro10 gene from saccharomyces cerevisiae was initially identified as a thiamine diphosphate-dependent phenylpyruvate decarboxylase with  a broad substrate specificity. it was suggested that the enzyme could be responsible for the catabolism of aromatic and branched-chain amino acids, as well as methionine. in the present study, we report the overexpression of the aro10 gene product in escherichia coli and the first detailed in vitro characterization of this enzyme. the enzyme is shown to be an efficient aromatic  2-keto acid decarboxylase, consistent with it playing a major in vivo role in phenylalanine, tryptophan and possibly also tyrosine catabolism. however, its substrate spectrum suggests that it is unlikely to play any significant role in the catabolism of the branched-chain amino acids or of methionine. a homology model was used to identify residues likely to be involved in substrate specificity. site-directed mutagenesis on those residues confirmed previous studies indicating that mutation of single residues is unlikely to produce the immediate conversion of an aromatic into an aliphatic 2-keto acid decarboxylase.  in addition, the enzyme was compared with the phenylpyruvate decarboxylase from azospirillum brasilense and the indolepyruvate decarboxylase from enterobacter cloacae. we show that the properties of the two phenylpyruvate decarboxylases are similar in some respects yet quite different in others, and that the properties of both are distinct from those of the indolepyruvate decarboxylase. finally, we  demonstrate that it is unlikely that replacement of a glutamic acid by leucine leads to discrimination between phenylpyruvate and indolepyruvate, although, in this case, it did lead to unexpected allosteric activation.

TI  == cell-based biosensor for measurement of phenol and nitrophenols toxicity.
AB  == a cost-effective whole cell biosensor based on electrochemical technique to detect toxicities of phenol and nitrophenols has been developed. this method relied on the inhibition effect for respiratory chain activity of microorganism by toxicant, which was measured by chronoamperometry using mediator (ferricyanide). the current signals produced by suspended microorganisms and reoxidation of ferrocyanide were transformed to inhibiting efficiency directly, and 50% inhibiting concentration (ic(50)) was chosen as the quantitative standard of toxicity. the test microorganisms used here consist of three bacilli (escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and alcaligenes faecalis), two pseudomonas (pseudomonas fluorescens and pseucomonas putida) and one fungus (trichosporon cutaneum). 3,5-dichlorophenol (dcp) was taken as the reference toxicant. the results showed that the microorganisms which belong to the same bacterial family had similar trends of inhibitions on respiratory activity and similar ic50 values. by comparing the ic(50) values, p. fluorescens was the most  sensitive one to dcp toxicity, its ic(50) was estimated to be 4.2mg/l. ph 7.0 and together with the standard glucose-glutamic acid (gga) as an exogenous material were taken for optimum conditions in this study. here, p. fluorescens as model test microorganism was employed to assess toxicities of phenol and nitrophenols under the optimum conditions. ic(50) values of 291.4 mg/l for phenol, 64.1mg/l for 2-np, 71.4 mg/l for 3-np and 14.0mg/l for 4-np were determined at 60 min, respectively. comparison with the results of published data has confirmed that this cell biosensor is a sensitive and rapid alternative to toxicity screening of chemicals.

TI  == the activity of antimicrobial peptide s-thanatin is independent on multidrug-resistant spectrum of bacteria.
AB  == in this study, the activity of s-thanatin (an analog of antimicrobial peptide derived from thanatin) against different bacterial pathogens frequently which can cause therapeutic problems was tested. the result showed minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of s-thanatin against all isolates of the escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella ornithinolytica and klebsiella oxytoca were in the range of 4-16mug/ml, no matter which antibiotic the bacterial was resistant or susceptible, while almost all mics to gram-positive bacterial were >128mug/ml except enterococcus faecium. s-thanatin was more effective toward gram-negative strains, especially for enterobacter and klebsiella. the mics of s-thanatin were no significantly different in the same species regardless of antibiotic sensitive or -resistant isolates to single or multiple antibiotic (p>0.05). likewise, no notable difference could be observed between e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, k. ornithinolytica which were sensitive to s-thanatin (p>0.05). it was implied that the antimicrobial activity of s-thanatin was independent on multi-drug resistance spectrum of bacteria.

TI  == changing trends in antimicrobial resistance of major bacterial pathogens, 1985-2005: a study from a medical center in northern taiwan.
AB  == background: antimicrobial resistance is a major health problem worldwide. we evaluated the antimicrobial resistance trends of 16 major bacterial pathogens at  a tertiary medical center in northern taiwan. methods: we conducted a retrospective review of annual summary documents for antimicrobial susceptibility of clinically isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria from 1985 to 2005. the numbers of isolates and susceptibilities were calculated for three 7-year periods: first period, 1985-1991; second period, 1992-1998; and the third  period, 1999-2005. results: during the 21-year period, 219,715 bacterial pathogens were identified. a significant increase in incidence over time was found for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s epidermidis, penicillin-nonsusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, erythromycin-resistant s pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, cefotaxime/ceftriaxone-resistant escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, and  imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. additionally, a significant increase  in ciprofloxacin resistance rates over time from 1996 to 2005 was noted for e coli, enterobacter cloacae, and a baumannii (through 1997 to 2005). however, a significant decrease in erythromycin resistance rate with time from 1999 to 2005  was found for groups a and b streptococci, non-a, b, d streptococci, and s pneumoniae. conclusion: resistance to antimicrobial agents increased rapidly in the past two decades in taiwan and has become very common in major bacterial pathogens. continuous enforcement of policies to limit use of antimicrobial agents and active surveillance of antimicrobial resistance through a nationwide system are both warranted.

TI  == correlation between antibiotic consumption and resistance of gram-negative bacteria causing healthcare-associated infections at a university hospital in taiwan from 2000 to 2009.
AB  == objectives: this study investigated the correlation between antibiotic consumption and antimicrobial resistance in gram-negative bacteria causing healthcare-associated infections at a university hospital in taiwan from 2000 to  2009. methods: disc susceptibility data of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus spp., pseudomonas  aeruginosa, acinetobacter spp., stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli causing healthcare-associated infections were evaluated. data on annual patient-days and annual consumption (defined daily doses per 1000 patient-days) of extended-spectrum cephalosporins, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems, aminoglycosides and fl uoroquinolones were analysed. results: the trend of total consumption of extended-spectrum cephalosporins, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones significantly increased between 2000 and 2003 and remained stable between 2004 and 2009. the decreasing use of gentamicin and amikacin in recent years was associated with increasing susceptibility of e. coli, e. cloacae, s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa to gentamicin, as well as increasing susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to amikacin. the use of piperacillin/tazobactam was positively correlated with the prevalence  of piperacillin/tazobactam-resistant e. coli and s. maltophilia. in contrast, the use of cefotaxime and piperacillin/tazobactam was negatively correlated with the  prevalence of cefotaxime-resistant e. coli and piperacillin/tazobactam-resistant  s. maltophilia, respectively. the consumption of fluoroquinolones was positively  correlated with the rates of ciprofloxacin-resistant e. coli, piperacillin/tazobactam-resistant p. aeruginosa and ceftazidime-resistant s. maltophilia. conclusions: the relationship between antibiotic prescription and the rates of resistance for gram-negative bacteria is complicated; every type of  antimicrobial agent or even individual agent can have distinct associations with  different pathogens.

TI  == what remains against carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae? evaluation of chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, colistin, fosfomycin, minocycline, nitrofurantoin, temocillin and tigecycline.
AB  == carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae present an increasing and diverse problem, including strains of multiple species with metallo-beta-lactamases (imp, ndm or vim) and non-metallo (kpc and oxa-48) enzymes as well as those combining an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) or ampc enzyme with porin loss. most strains, except those with oxa-48 alone, are broadly resistant to beta-lactams and have multiple aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes; those with ndm-1 carbapenemase typically also have 16s rrna methylases, conferring complete aminoglycoside resistance. in this study, the activity of chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, colistin, fosfomycin, minocycline, nitrofurantoin, temocillin and  tigecycline was evaluated against 81 carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae isolates from the uk. testing was performed by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) agar dilution method. chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin and nitrofurantoin inhibited <25% of the isolates at the breakpoint, whereas colistin was active against 75/81 isolates (92.6%), the exceptions being four klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae isolates along with members of inherently resistant genera. fosfomycin was active against 49/81 isolates (60.5%), including 7/7 escherichia coli, 16/20 enterobacter and citrobacter spp., but only 25/52 klebsiella spp. tigecycline was active against 38/81 isolates (46.9%) and was intermediate against another 27 (33.3%), with resistance scattered amongst k. pneumoniae and enterobacter spp. the activity of colistin, fosfomycin and tigecycline was unrelated to the isolates' carbapenem resistance mechanisms. temocillin was fully active [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) </=8 mg/l] against only 4/81 isolates (4.9%), but inhibited a further 22 isolates (27.2%) at the british society for antimicrobial chemotherapy (bsac) urinary breakpoint (32 mg/l), predominantly comprising those isolates with combinations of impermeability and an esbl or ampc enzyme, along with 6/11 isolates producing  kpc carbapenemases. studies with transconjugants and transformants confirmed the  small effect of kpc enzymes against temocillin, whereas oxa-48 and ndm-1 conferred clear resistance.

TI  == escherichia, klebsiella, enterobacter, serratia, citrobacter, and proteus
AB  == the gram-negative bacilli of the genera escherichia, klebsiella, enterobacter, serratia, citrobacter,and proteus(table 26- 1) are members of the normal intestinal flora of humans and animals and may be isolated from a variety of environmental sources. with the exception of proteus, they are sometimes collectively referred to as the coliform bacilli because of shared properties, particularly the ability of most species to ferment the sugar lactose. many of these microorganisms used to be dismissed as harmless commensals. today, they are known to be responsible for major health problems worldwide. a limited number of  species, including e coli, k pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, s marcescens,and p mirabilis, are responsible for most infections produced by this group of organisms. the increasing incidence of the coliforms, proteus, and other gram-negative organisms in diseases reflects in part a better  understanding of their pathogenic potential but more importantly the changing ecology of bacterial disease. the widespread and often indiscriminate use of antibiotics has created drug-resistant gram-negative bacilli that readily acquire multiple resistance through transmission of drug resistance plasmids (r factors). also, development of new surgical procedures, health support technology, and therapeutic regimens has provided new portals of entry and compromised many host  defenses.

TI  == the relevance of aortic endograft prosthetic infection.
AB  == background: vascular prosthetic graft infection is a severe complication after open aortic aneurysm repair. reports of infected endografts are scarce. general treatment consensus with infected graft material is that it should be removed completely. the objective of this study was to describe the incidence of endograft infection after endovascular repair of abdominal (evar) and thoracic aortic aneurysm (tevar) and to report treatment options and their outcome. methods: a retrospective cohort study was performed of patients endovascularly operated for abdominal and thoracic aortic aneurysm in two large hospitals (one tertiary referral center and one large community hospital) between march 1996 and june 2009. diagnosis of infected endograft was made based on clinical findings, blood tests and cultures, imaging studies (computed tomography, fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography), and intraoperative findings at reoperation. results: eleven patients with an infected endograft were identified in 1431 endovascular procedures. one other patient was referred from another hospital. patients were aged 68 +/- 9 years, and all but one were male. the median time from initial tevar/evar to the diagnosis of infection was 115 days (range, 7-3748 days), with 42% of patients presenting within 3 months after tevar/evar. seven patients were diagnosed with endograft infection after elective tevar/evar and five after emergency tevar/evar. the incidence was significantly higher in patients that were treated in an emergency setting (0.56% vs 2.79%; p = .002), while there was no significant difference between tevar and evar procedures (1.37% vs 0.77%). all patients were initially treated with antibiotic therapy, which was complemented with surgical intervention in six patients. in four patients, the infected graft material was completely explanted. isolated microorganisms included staphylococcus species (n = 4), streptococcus species (n  = 4), enterobacter cloacae (n = 1), escherichia coli (n = 1), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1), and listeria monocytogenes (n = 1). median time of follow-up  was 201 days (range, 6-2023 days). during the study period, three out of 12 patients died, of which two were treated conservatively (p = ns). at their last follow-up visit, seven of nine patients still used antimicrobial therapy. conclusions: the incidence of endograft infection is below 1%, with a mortality rate of 25%. although consensus is that infected graft material should always be  removed, this study shows no significant difference in mortality between the conservatively- and the surgically-managed group, possibly related to the small sample size. there may be a role for conservative treatment in selected cases of  patients with an infected endograft.

TI  == identification of a novel fosfomycin resistance gene (fosa2) in enterobacter cloacae from the salmon river, canada.
AB  == aims: to investigate the occurrence of fosfomycin-resistant (fos(r) ) bacteria in aquatic environments. methods and results: a fos(r) strain of enterobacter cloacae was isolated from a water sample collected at a site (50 degrees 41'33.44''n, 119 degrees 19'49.50''w) near the mouth of the salmon river at salmon arm, in south-central british columbia, canada. the strain was identified  by pcr screening for plasmid-borne, fosa-family amplicons, followed by selective  plating. sequencing of the resistance gene cloned using pcr primers to conserved  flanking dna revealed a new allele (95% amino acid identity to fosa), and i-ceu i pfge showed that it was chromosomally located. in escherichia coli, the cloned dna conferred a greater resistance to fosfomycin than its fosa counterpart. conclusions: gene fosa2 conferred fosfomycin resistance in an environmental isolate of ent. cloacae. significance and impact of the study: the repurposing of older antibiotics should be considered in the light of existing reservoirs of resistance genes in the environment.

TI  == diarrheagenic escherichia coli in acute gastroenteritis in infants in north-west  italy.
AB  == enteropathogenic escherichia coli may cause diarrhoea in infancy, but it is not routinely detected and regarded as a major causative agent. the aim of the present study was to estimate the incidence of enteropathogenic e. coli infection and to investigate its epidemiology and pathogenesis from faecal specimens in infants hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis. between march 2008 and june 2009, faecal samples were collected and examined to recognize diarrhoeal aetiology, especially for e. coli, by cultural identification and multiplex-pcr. e. coli were isolated in 75 of 160 collected samples (46,88%); 10 samples of which (6,3%) had been positively recognised for pathogenic genes. data showed that the presence of diarrheagenic e. coli infection was 6.3%, but it becomes 5% considering e. coli as a unique agent responsible for diarrhoea. the datum is not statistically meaningful because of the small sample (p>0,05). bacterial pathogens were also isolated in 60 samples (37,5% of the total collected samples): 15 salmonella spp., 8 klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 klebsiella oxytoca, 11 citrobacter freundii, 5 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 serratia spp., 7 enterobacter cloacae, 1 shigella spp., 2 campylobacter spp. rotavirus was the predominant pathogenic single etiologic agent identified. it was found in 35 samples (21.88%  of the overall collected samples), while adenovirus, serotypes 40 or 41, was isolated in 2 samples (1.3%). rotavirus infection was found predominantly in winter with respect to autumn. data provide an interesting epidemiologic survey of enteropathogenic e. coli, which is not usually detected, although it may have  potential clinical implications. abbreviations: cdec, detaching e. coli; daec, diffusely adherent e. coli; eaggec, enteroaggregative e. coli; ehec, enterohaemorrhagic e. coli; eiec, enteroinvasive e. coli; epec, enteropathogenic  e. coli; etec, enterotoxigenic e. coli.

TI  == influence of referral bias on the clinical characteristics of patients with gram-negative bloodstream infection.
AB  == referral bias can influence the results of studies performed at tertiary-care centres. in this study, we evaluated demographic and microbiological factors that influenced referral of patients with gram-negative bloodstream infection (bsi). we identified 2919 and 846 unique patients with gram-negative bsi in a referral cohort of patients treated at mayo clinic hospitals and a population-based cohort of olmsted county, minnesota, residents between 1 january 1998 and 31 december 2007, respectively. multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with referral. elderly patients aged >/=80 years with gram-negative bsi were less likely to be referred than younger patients [odds ratio (or) 0.43, 95% confidence intervals (ci) 0.30-0.62] as were females (or 0.63, 95% ci 0.53-0.74). after adjusting for age and gender, bloodstream isolates of escherichia coli (or 0.50, 95% ci 0.43-0.58) and proteus mirabilis (or 0.49, 95% ci 0.30-0.82) were underrepresented in the referral cohort; and pseudomonas aeruginosa (or 2.26, 95% ci 1.70-3.06), enterobacter cloacae (or 2.31, 95% ci 1.53-3.66), serratia marcescens (or 2.34, 95% ci 1.33-4.52) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (or 17.94, 95% ci 3.98-314.43) were overrepresented  in the referral cohort. we demonstrated that demographic and microbiological characteristics of patients with gram-negative bsi had an influence on referral patterns. these factors should be considered when interpreting results of investigations performed at tertiary-care centres.

TI  == is selective digestive decontamination useful in controlling aerobic gram-negative bacilli producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases?
AB  == aims: to identify outbreak episodes of either carriage or infection due to extended spectrum beta-lactamases producing aerobic gram-negative bacilli (agnb-esbl); to establish whether agnb-esbl, sensitive to tobramycin, become resistant over time; and to evaluate the impact of selective decontamination of the digestive tract (sdd) on abnormal carriage of agnb-esbl. design and setting:  all children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (picu) over a 12-month period had biweekly surveillance cultures of throat and rectum and diagnostic cultures when clinically indicated. all agnb were tested for esbl, and the positive isolates were sent for molecular typing. the picu uses sdd (parenteral cefotaxime and enteral polymyxin e/tobramycin) to control abnormal carriage. patients who had at least one agnb-esbl were included in the study. results: during the study period, 1,101 children were admitted to the picu. there were 39  patients (3.5%) with a total of 236 cultures positive for agnb-esbl. twenty-eight patients (2.5%) were carriers, and 11 (1%) had proven infections. organisms isolated from the first culture were 14 patients with klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 with enterobacter cloacae, 7 with citrobacter freundii, 5 with klebsiella oxytoca, and 5 with escherichia coli. in the first sample, 59% of isolates showed tobramycin resistance. molecular typing confirmed that there were five different  strains of k. pneumoniae and that similar strains were not isolated in the same period. conclusions: sdd is an effective measure to control agnb-esbl and to avoid outbreak episodes of either carriage or infection. when tobramycin resistance is found, replacing it with another aminoglycoside based on antibiogram may be more effective in achieving agnb clearance.

AB  == introduction: although independently acquired, plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance appears to be linked with extended-spectrum or ampc-type beta-lactamases. since no data are available in african countries, the prevalence of qnr genes at the university hospital ibn rochd, casablanca, morocco, was investigated. methodology: between october 2006 and march 2007, the following 39  randomly selected non-duplicate enterobacteriaceae producing an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl), representing 20% of esbl strains with respect to species and ward origin, were collected: escherichia coli (n = 16); klebsiella spp (n = 14); enterobacter cloacae (n = 8); proteus mirabilis (n = 1). antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed according to clsi guidelines. esbl detection was performed by the double disc diffusion test. a multiplex pcr was conducted to detect qnra, qnrb and qnrs genes that were confirmed by sequencing of the pcr product. results: the estimated overall prevalence of qnr reached 36% (n = 14; qnra, 10.25%; qnrb, 23.07%; qnrs, 2.56%). genes were identified in e. coli, klebsiella and enterobacter with a respective prevalence of 18.7%, 50% and 62.5%. the qnr genes were detected in nine wards and qnra1, qnrb1-b2-b4 and qnrs1 variants were identified. three genes were identified among nalidixic acid susceptible strains (n = 6); three of those were also susceptible to ciprofloxacin. among nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin resistant strains, all strains had qnrb. conclusions: this study highlights the high prevalence of qnr genes among esbl strains in the ibn rochd chu, casablanca. moreover, qnr were present in quinolone-susceptible strains which could lead to in vivo selection of ciprofloxacin-resistant strains.

TI  == activity of tigecycline alone and in combination with colistin and meropenem against klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (kpc)-producing enterobacteriaceae strains by time-kill assay.
AB  == antibiotic combinations including tigecycline have not been studied against klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (kpc)-producing pathogens. tigecycline alone  and combined with colistin and meropenem was tested against eight genetically unrelated kpc-producing clinical strains of enterobacteriaceae (four k. pneumoniae, two escherichia coli, one enterobacter cloacae and one serratia marcescens) by time-kill assay. tigecycline displayed a concentration-independent bacteriostatic activity in seven strains and bactericidal activity in one strain. colistin showed bactericidal activity at 4x the minimum inhibitory concentration  (mic) in three strains and was bacteriostatic for the remaining strains and concentrations. meropenem was bactericidal in three strains and bacteriostatic in five strains. the tigecycline+meropenem combination was not bactericidal against  the four k. pneumoniae strains and was non-synergistic against all eight strains. tigecycline+colistin was bactericidal against all strains at most time intervals  and concentrations and was also synergistic at 1x and 2x mic against most strains up to 4-8h and at 4x mic up to 24 h against all strains. these findings suggest that, at most drug concentrations, tigecycline, colistin and meropenem as single  agents do not exhibit efficient bactericidal activity against most of the kpc-producing strains. tigecycline alone might be a therapeutic option for infections caused by kpc-producers when bacteriostatic activity is adequate or combined with colistin when bactericidal activity is necessary. additional in vivo tests are warranted to assess better the killing kinetics of tigecycline combinations against kpc-producers.

TI  == pharmacodynamic profiling of antimicrobials against gram-negative respiratory isolates from canadian hospitals.
AB  == background: with diminishing antimicrobial potency, the choice of effective empirical therapy has become more challenging. thus, the pharmacodynamic evaluation of potential therapies is essential to identify optimal agents, doses  and administration strategies. methods: monte carlo simulation was conducted for  standard and/or prolonged infusion regimens of cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, doripenem, ertapenem, meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam. minimum inhibitory concentrations were obtained for escherichia coli (n=64 respiratory isolates), enterobacter cloacae (n=53), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=75) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=273) throughout canada. the cumulative fraction of response (cfr) was calculated using bactericidal targets for each regimen against each species. a cfr >/=90% was defined as optimal. results: all cefepime, doripenem, ertapenem and meropenem regimens achieved optimal exposures against enterobacteriaceae, whereas target attainment was organism and dose dependent for the other agents. prolonged infusion doripenem and meropenem 1 g and 2 g every 8 h, along with standard infusion doripenem and meropenem 2 g every 8 h, were the only regimens to attain  optimal exposures against p aeruginosa. ciprofloxacin had the lowest cfr against  p aeruginosa, followed by cefepime. among the p aeruginosa isolates collected in  the intensive care unit (icu) compared with the wards, differences of 0.5% to 10% were noted in favour of non-icu isolates for all agents; however, marked differences (10% to 15%) in cfr were observed for ciprofloxacin in favour of icu  isolates. conclusion: standard dosing of cefepime, doripenem, ertapenem and meropenem has a high likelihood of obtaining optimal pharmacodynamic indexes against these enterobacteriaceae. for p aeruginosa, aggressive treatment with high-dose and/or prolonged infusion regimens are likely required to address the elevated resistance rates of respiratory isolates from canada.

TI  == bactericidal oncocin derivatives with superior serum stabilities.
AB  == the proline-rich antimicrobial peptide oncocin is remarkably active in vitro against a number of important gram-negative bacteria of concern to humans owing to their increasing resistance to antibiotics, i.e. enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae) and non-fermenting species (acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa). degradation of oncocin in mouse serum was investigated in this study. several approaches to stabilise the main cleavage sites (c-terminal to arg-15 and n-terminal to arg-19) by substituting either or both arginine (arg) residues with non-proteinogenic amino acids, i.e. alpha-amino-3-guanidino-propionic acid, homoarginine, nitro-arginine, n-methyl-arginine, beta-homoarginine, d-arginine (d-arg) or ornithine (orn), were tested. these modifications were found to increase the half-life of oncocin in full mouse serum. for oncocin with two orn residues in positions 15 and 19, the half-life in full serum increased from 25 min to 3 h. an increase of >8 h was observed for oncocin with two d-arg residues  at these same positions. the antibacterial activities of these modified sequences were slightly better than the original oncocin sequence. moreover, the three most stable analogues were found to be bactericidal against e. coli and were not toxic to hela cells or haemolytic to human erythrocytes.

TI  == serendipitous discovery of alpha-hydroxyalkyl esters as beta-lactamase substrates.
AB  == o-(1-carboxy-1-alkyloxycarbonyl) hydroxamates were found to spontaneously decarboxylate in aqueous neutral buffer to form o-(2-hydroxyalkylcarbonyl) hydroxamates. while the former molecules do not react rapidly with serine beta-lactamases, the latter are quite good substrates of representative class a and c, but not d, enzymes, and particularly of a class c enzyme. the enzymes catalyze hydrolysis of these compounds to a mixture of the alpha-hydroxy acid and hydroxamate. analogous compounds containing aryloxy leaving groups rather that hydroxamates are also substrates. structure-activity experiments showed that the  alpha-hydroxyl group was required for any substantial substrate activity. although both d- and l-alpha-hydroxy acid derivatives were substrates, the former were preferred. the response of the class c activity to ph and to alternative nucleophiles (methanol and d-phenylalanine) suggested that the same active site functional groups participated in catalysis as for classical substrates. molecular modeling was employed to explore how the alpha-hydroxy group might interact with the class c beta-lactamase active site. incorporation of the alpha-hydroxyalkyl moiety into novel inhibitors will be of considerable interest.

TI  == long-term characteristics of healthcare-associated infections in a neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  == background/purpose: healthcare-associated infections in neonatal intensive care units (nicus) are associated with a significant risk of morbidity and mortality.  knowledge regarding pathogens, primary sources of infection and antibiotic resistance in the nicu is essential for developing management strategies. this study aimed to analyze the long-term characteristics of healthcare-associated infections in a tertiary referral center in southern taiwan. methods: infants < 30 days old, with positive blood, cerebrospinal fluid, urine or tissue fluid cultures during hospitalization in the nicu of national cheng kung university hospital from july 1989 to june 2008 were included in the study. results: in total, 1,417 organisms and episodes were identified during the study period. gram-positive organisms, gram-negative organisms and fungi constituted 923 (65.1%), 358 (25.3%) and 136 (9.6%) of the pathogens, respectively. of the gram-positive organisms, coagulase-negative staphylococci (51.5%), staphylococcus aureus (34.8%) and enterococcus spp. (6.1%) were the major pathogens; and 27% of  staphylococcus aureus isolates were oxacillin-resistant. for the gram-negative organisms, klebsiella pneumoniae (22%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.8%), escherichia coli (16.7%) and enterobacter cloacae (16.7%) were dominant. also, candida albicans accounted for 50% of fungal infections. the most common source of infection was bloodstream infection (59.0%), and 5.6% of these were catheter-related. skin and soft tissue infections were also frequent (26.3%). conclusion: bloodstream and skin/soft tissue infections caused by commensal species play an important role in healthcare-associated infections in the nicu. new measures should be developed in response to the changing patterns in the nicu.

TI  == surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility of aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with intra-abdominal infections in china: the 2002-2009 study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart).
AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate the distribution and susceptibility of aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacilli (gnb) isolated from patients with intra-abdominal infections (iais) in china. from 2002 to 2009, minimum inhibitory concentrations of 14 antibiotics for 3420 aerobic and facultative gnb from up to eight hospitals in six cities were determined by the broth microdilution method. enterobacteriaceae comprised 82.9% (2834/3420) of the total isolates, with escherichia coli (49.2%) being the most commonly isolated species followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (17.0%), enterobacter cloacae (5.8%) and citrobacter freundii (2.3%). amongst the antimicrobial agents tested, the three carbapenems (ertapenem, imipenem and meropenem) were the most active agents against enterobacteriaceae, with susceptibility rates of 96.1-99.6% (2002-2009),  98.2-100% (2002-2009) and 99.6-100% (2002-2004), respectively, followed by amikacin (86.8-95.1%) and piperacillin/tazobactam (84.5-94.3%). susceptibility rates of all tested third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins against enterobacteriaceae declined by nearly 30%, with susceptibility rates of 40.2%, 39.1%, 56.3% and 51.8% in 2009 for ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and cefepime, respectively. the occurrence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases increased rapidly, especially for e. coli (from 20.8% in 2002 to 64.9% in 2009).  susceptibility of e. coli to ciprofloxacin decreased from 57.6% in 2002 to 24.2%  in 2009. the least active agent against enterobacteriaceae was ampicillin/sulbactam (sam) (25.3-44.3%). in conclusion, enterobacteriaceae were the major pathogens causing iais, and carbapenems retained the highest susceptibility rates over the 8-year study period. third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and sam may not be ideal choices for empirical therapy of iais in china.

TI  == vejovine, a new antibiotic from the scorpion venom of vaejovis mexicanus.
AB  == multidrug resistant bacterial infections are one of the most important health problems in recent years. resistance to conventional antibiotics limits the therapeutic options causing increase rate in morbid-mortality in hospitals. therefore, new antibacterial agents with new bacterial targets have been searched and found in many different sources, including scorpion venom and scorpion hemolymph. here, we report a new anti-microbial peptide named vejovine. this peptide was isolated from the venom of the mexican scorpion vaejovis mexicanus by two steps of reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (rp-hplc). it  is composed of 47 amino acid residues with no cysteine residues in its sequence,  with a molecular weight of 4873 da. the chemical synthesis of vejovine was performed by the solid phase method of merrifield, using fluoren-9-ylmethoxycarbonyl (fmoc)-amino acids. both the native and synthetic peptides were shown to have essentially the same activity. vejovine inhibits growth of clinical isolates of gram-negative multidrug resistant (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and acinetobacter baumanii) causing nosocomial infections with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 4.4 mum up to 50 mum. this peptide has also hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes with a hc(50) value of 100 mum. a cdna library of the venomous gland of this scorpion provided material for cloning the  gene encoding vejovine. this peptide is a new type of antibiotic, showing less than 50% similarity to other known scorpion peptides. vejovine is a candidate to  be used as a leading compound for future development of an effective peptide against multidrug resistant bacteria.

TI  == mutation of a degs homologue in enterobacter cloacae decreases colonization and biological control of damping-off on cucumber.
AB  == we have been using mutagenesis to determine how biocontrol bacteria such as enterobacter cloacae 501r3 deal with complex nutritional environments found in association with plants. e. cloacae c10, a mutant of 501r3 with a transposon insertion in degs, was diminished in growth on synthetic cucumber root exudate (sre), colonization of cucumber seed and roots, and control of damping-off of cucumber caused by pythium ultimum. degs, a periplasmic serine protease in the closely related bacterium escherichia coli k12, is required for the rpoe-mediated stress response. c10 containing wild-type degs from 501r3 or from e. coli k12 on  pbelobac11 was significantly increased in growth on sre, colonization of cucumber roots, and control of p. ultimum relative to c10 containing pbelobac11 alone. c10 and 501r3 were similar in sensitivity to acidic conditions, plant-derived phenolic compounds, oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide, dessication, and high osmoticum; stress conditions potentially associated with plants. this study demonstrates a role for degs in the spermosphere and rhizosphere during colonization and disease control by enterobacter cloacae. this study implicates,  for the first time, the involvement of degs and, by extension, the rpoe-mediated  stress response, in reducing stress on e. cloacae resulting from the complex nutritional environments in the spermosphere and rhizosphere.

AB  == our objective was to analyse phenotypic and genetic data of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli and serratia marcescens that cause infections in our hospital. over a 3 year period, 342 randomly selected clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates  were tested for esbl production and evaluated for the presence of the beta-lactamase genes bla(shv), bla(tem,) bla(ctx-m) and bla(tla-1). the antibiotic susceptibilities of these isolates were also determined, and the clonality of the isolates was assessed by pfge. based on our analyses, 33/92 (35.9 %) k. pneumoniae, 31/87 (35.6 %) enterobacter cloacae, 24/80 (30 %) e. coli and 17/83 (20.5 %) s. marcescens were identified as esbl producers. the presence  of tem, shv or ctx esbl types was detected in 99/105 (94 %) of the isolates. tla-1 was not detected in any of the 105 isolates. the dominant esbl types were bla(shv-5) (n=33), bla(shv12) (n=31) and bla(ctx-m-15) (n=30). the predominant esbl identified in e. coli and enterobacter cloacae isolates was ctx-m-15, whereas in k. pneumoniae and s. marcescens the predominant types were shv-12 and  shv-5, respectively. pfge genotyping revealed two main genetic patterns in the k. pneumoniae isolates, types shv-12 and tem-1+shv-5. an outbreak caused by enterobacter cloacae shv-5+ctx-m-15 was detected. in contrast, most esbl-producing isolates of e. coli and s. marcescens did not have similar pfge banding patterns and thus were not genetically similar. enterobacteriaceae are a  concern in our hospital, especially k. pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. our results confirm that the ctx-m-15 esbl type has spread rapidly in the hospital, and thus requires careful monitoring.

TI  == evaluation of the diversilab system for detection of hospital outbreaks of infections by different bacterial species.
AB  == many bacterial typing methods are specific for one species only, time-consuming,  or poorly reproducible. diversilab (dl; biomerieux) potentially overcomes these limitations. in this study, we evaluated the dl system for the identification of  hospital outbreaks of a number bacterial species. appropriately typed clinical isolates were tested with dl. dl typing agreed with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) for acinetobacter (n = 26) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 13) isolates. with two exceptions, dl typing of klebsiella isolates (n = 23) also correlated with pfge, and in addition, pfge-nontypeable (pfge-nt) isolates could be typed. enterobacter (n = 28) results also correlated  with pfge results; also, pfge-nt isolates could be clustered. in a larger study (n = 270), a cluster of 30 isolates was observed that could be subdivided by pfge. the results for escherichia coli (n = 38) correlated less well with an experimental multilocus variable number of tandem repeats analysis (mlva) scheme. pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 52) showed only a limited number of amplification products for most isolates. when multiple pseudomonas isolates were assigned to a single type in dl, all except one showed multiple multilocus sequence types. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus generally also showed a limited number of amplification products. isolates that belonged to different outbreaks by other typing methods, including pfge, spa typing, and mlva, were grouped together in a number of cases. for enterococcus faecium, the limited variability  of the amplification products obtained made interpretation difficult and correlation with mlva and esp gene typing was poor. all of the results are reflected in simpson's index of diversity and adjusted rand's and wallace's coefficients. dl is a useful tool to help identify hospital outbreaks of acinetobacter spp., s. maltophilia, the enterobacter cloacae complex, klebsiella  spp., and, to a somewhat lesser extent, e. coli. in our study, dl was inadequate  for p. aeruginosa, e. faecium, and mrsa. however, it should be noted that for the identification of outbreaks, epidemiological data should be combined with typing  results.

AB  == this study was designed to determine the degree and type of bacterial contamination of ejaculated semen samples in fertile rams and its consequences on sperm quality during storage. in experiment 1, 68 ejaculates from 36 rams were divided into two aliquots, one of which was used for bacterial culture, while the other one was diluted, stored at 15 degrees c and assessed for plasma membrane integrity and motility at 0, 24 and 48h after dilution. from the 68 ejaculates, 66 were positive for aerobic bacteria, including 20 species of bacteria from 14 genera. the most frequently isolated bacteria were escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus epidermis, and staphylococcus aureus species. these 5 bacteria were present in 97% of all contaminated samples. all contaminant bacteria were found to be sensitive to gentamicin and to ceftiofur, with variable percentages of resistance to the other antibiotics evaluated. in samples with total enterobacteria count lower than 100 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml, higher proportions of motile and progressive sperm and higher velocities of spermatozoa were observed at different times during storage. in experiment 2, pure cultures of the most frequently isolated bacteria  were individually added to fresh semen samples of low contamination and tested for their effects on sperm quality during storage at 15 degrees c. semen with e.  coli showed a drastic reduction in motility, velocity and viability during storage. this reduction was also significant, but less drastic, in semen with e.  cloacae and p. mirabilis, whereas it was partial and less pronounced in the other groups (s. epidermidis and s. aureus). in conclusion, the contamination of ram semen with enterobacterial species reduced sperm quality during storage at 15 degrees c, and the antibiotics gentamicin and ceftiofur showed the higher antimicrobial activities.

TI  == sensitization of microcin j25-resistant strains by a membrane-permeabilizing peptide.
AB  == microcin j25 (mccj25) is a plasmid-encoded, 21-amino-acid, antibacterial peptide  produced by escherichia coli. mccj25 inhibits rna polymerase and the membrane respiratory chain. mccj25 uptake into e. coli-sensitive strains is mediated by the outer membrane receptor fhua and the inner membrane proteins tonb, exbb, exbd, and sbma. this peptide is active on some e. coli, salmonella, and shigella  species strains, while other gram-negative bacteria, such as clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, moraxella catarrhalis, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, are completely resistant. in the present work, we demonstrated that the membrane-permeabilizing peptide (kff)(3)k made some resistant strains sensitive to mccj25, among them s. typhimurium, where the antibiotic inhibits in vitro cell growth and bacterial replication within macrophages. the results demonstrate that the membrane permeabilization induced by (kff)(3)k allows mccj25 penetration in an fhua and sbma-independent manner and suggest that the combination of both peptides could be considered as a therapeutic agent against pathogenic salmonella strains.

TI  == the clinical and prognostic importance of positive blood cultures in adults.
AB  == background: bloodstream infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in adults. bloodstream infections should be reassessed periodically because of increased antibiotic resistance, more patients receiving immunomodulatory therapy, improved antiretroviral therapy, and acquisition of infection in health  care settings other than hospitals. methods: we conducted retrospective assessment by infectious disease physicians of hospitalized adults with positive  blood cultures at 3 academic medical centers. results: two thousand two hundred seventy positive blood culture episodes occurred in 1706 patients. of 2669 isolates, 51% represented true infection, 41% contamination, and 8% unknown clinical significance. although coagulase-negative staphylococci were most common, only 10% were clinically significant. among 1225 true bloodstream infections, the most frequent isolates were staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., klebsiella pneumoniae, coagulase-negative staphylococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterobacter cloacae, and serratia marcescens. intravenous catheters were the most common primary source of bloodstream infection (23% of episodes). most (81%) bloodstream infections were acquired in the hospital or other health care settings. crude and attributable in-hospital case-fatality ratios were 20% and 12%, respectively, lower than in previous studies. increasing age, hypotension, absence of fever, hospital acquisition, extreme white blood cell count values, and the presence of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, malignancy, or renal disease were significantly associated with an increased risk of in-hospital attributable death in multivariable analysis. conclusions: the proportion of bloodstream infections  due to intravenous catheters is continuing to increase. most episodes were acquired in the hospital or other health care setting. in-hospital case-fatality  ratios have decreased compared with previous studies. several previously identified factors associated with an increased mortality remain statistically significant.

TI  == seasonal variation, chemical composition, and analgesic and antimicrobial activities of the essential oil from leaves of tetradenia riparia (hochst.) codd  in southern brazil.
AB  == the seasonal variation of the chemical composition of the essential oil from fresh leaves of tetradenia riparia (hochst.) codd grown in southern brazil was analyzed by gc-ms, and the analgesic and antimicrobial activities of this oil were assayed. the yield of essential oil ranged from 0.17% to 0.26%, with the maximum amount in winter and the minimum in spring. the results obtained from principal components analysis (pca) revealed the existence of high chemical variability in the different seasons. the samples were clearly discriminated into three groups: winter, autumn, and spring-summer. samples collected during winter  contained the highest percentages of calyculone (24.70%), abietadiene (13.54%), and viridiflorol (4.20%). in autumn, the major constituents were ledol (8.74%) and cis-muurolol-5-en-4-alpha-ol (13.78%). samples collected in spring-summer contained the highest percentages of fenchone (12.67%), 14-hydroxy-9-epi-caryophyllene (24.36%), and alpha-cadinol (8.33%). oxygenated sesquiterpenes were predominant in all the samples analyzed. the observed chemovariation might be environmentally determined by a seasonal influence. the essential oil, when given orally at a dose of 200 mg/kg, exhibited good analgesic activity on acetic acid-induced writhing in mice, inhibiting the constrictions by 38.94% to 46.13%, and this effect was not affected by seasonal variation. the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil against the bacterial strains: staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, proteus  mirabilis, morganella morganii, and enterobacter cloacae, and the pathogenic fungus candida albicans was assessed by the disc diffusion method and determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration. the results obtained, followed by measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), indicated  that s. aureus, b. subtilis, and candida albicans were the most sensitive microorganisms, showing largest inhibition, and the lowest mic values varied from 15.6 to 31.2 microg/ml, 7.8 to 15.6 microg/ml, and 31.2 to 62.5 microg/ml, respectively.

TI  == common origin of plasmid encoded alpha-hemolysin genes in escherichia coli.
AB  == background: alpha (alpha)-hemolysin is a pore forming cytolysin and serves as a virulence factor in intestinal and extraintestinal pathogenic strains of e. coli. it was suggested that the genes encoding alpha-hemolysin (hlycabd) which can be found on the chromosome and plasmid, were acquired through horizontal gene transfer. plasmid-encoded alpha-hly is associated with certain enterotoxigenic (etec), shigatoxigenic (stec) and enteropathogenic e. coli (epec) strains. in uropathogenic e. coli (upec), the alpha-hly genes are located on chromosomal pathogenicity islands. previous work suggested that plasmid and chromosomally encoded alpha-hly may have evolved independently. this was explored in our study. results: we have investigated 11 alpha-hly plasmids from animal and human etec, stec and epec strains. the size of alpha-hly plasmids ranges from 48-157 kb and eight plasmids are conjugative. the regulatory gene (hlyr) located upstream of the hlycabd gene operon and an is911 element located downstream of hlyd are conserved. chromosomally-encoded alpha-hly operons lack the hlyr and is911 elements. the dna sequence of hlyc and hlya divided the plasmid- and chromosomally-encoded alpha-hemolysins into two clusters. the plasmid-encoded alpha-hly genes could be further divided into three groups based on the insertion of is1 and is2 in the regulatory region upstream of the alpha-hly operon. transcription of the hlya gene was higher than the housekeeping icda gene in all  strains (rq 4.8 to 143.2). nucleotide sequence analysis of a chromosomally located alpha-hly determinant in enterobacter cloacae strain indicates that it originates from an e. coli alpha-hly plasmid. conclusion: our data indicate that  plasmids encoding alpha-hly in e. coli descended from a common ancestor independent of the plasmid size and the origin of the strains. conjugative plasmids could contribute to the spread of the alpha-hly determinant to enterobacter cloacae. the presence of is-elements flanking the plasmid-encoded alpha-hly indicate that they might be mobile genetic elements.

AB  == using susceptibility rates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae over time as markers, we assessed the significance of the change of susceptibility rates to imipenem, ceftriaxone,  cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin over time and the relationship to antibiotic use for the period 2000-2006. antibiotic use-susceptibility relationships were assessed using longitudinal regression analysis. the variables "time" and define daily doses (ddd)/1,000 patient days for the specific drug related to the susceptibility rates of that particular model's dependent variable were considered as the main effects, with significance determined at the 0.05 level. decreases in susceptibility of the target organisms were common over the period of observation. decreasing susceptibility trends over time were not statistically associated with the primary drug (e.g., organism susceptibility rate to imipenem with imipenem usage). however, secondary drug use was associated with susceptibility rates (e.g., susceptibility of e. cloacae to cefepime with piperacillin/tazobactam usage). these results suggest that antibiotic use-resistance relationships are influenced by the use of secondary antibiotics. thus, a resistance problem may not be adequately addressed by simply altering the utilization of the primary antibiotic.

AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producers in the family enterobacteriaceae are recognized worldwide as nosocomial pathogens, however it is difficult to screen them in the routine laboratory processing. chromid esbl agar newly developed for screening esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae was released in japan in april, 2007. we evaluated the clinical assessment of chromid esbl agar in routine microbiology laboratory. the 47 strains investigated were clinical isolates belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae with the mics of cefpodoxime greater than 2 mug/ml. the 27 esbl-producers examined were comprising of 19 escherichia coli, 3 klebsiella oxytoca, 1 citrobacter freundii, 3 enterobacter cloacae, and 1 s. marcescens (esbl group) and 20 esbl non-producers  consiating of 5 k. oxytoca, 1 proteus mirabilis, 1 p. vlugaris, 2 serratia marcescens, 8 c. freundii, 2 enterobacter cloacae, and 1 e. aerogenes (non-esbl group). characterization of beta-lactamase genes was carried out by use of polymerase chain reaction. as the results, the sensitivity and the specificity of chromid esbl agar plates after incubation for 18 hours was 100% and 20%, respectively. it should be noted that the values of specificity was extremely low compared with those of the sensitivity. these findings clearly suggested that in  cases of utilizing chromid esbl agar plates, it should be important to consider its characteristic properties, as even the esbl-non-producers could grow on these media only when they were resistant to cpdx.

TI  == microbiological profile and antimicrobial susceptibility in surgical site infections following hollow viscus injury.
AB  == introduction: the purpose of this study was to assess the microbiological profile, antimicrobial susceptibility, and adequacy of the empiric antibiotic therapy in surgical site infections (ssi) following traumatic hollow viscus injury (hvi). methods: this is a retrospective study of patients admitted with an hvi from march 2003 to july 2009. ssi was defined as a wound infection or intra-abdominal collection confirmed by positive cultures and requiring percutaneous or surgical drainage. results: a total of 91 of 667 (13.6%) patients with an hvi developed an ssi confirmed by positive culture. mean age was 33.0 +/- 14.1 years, mean injury severity score (iss) was 17.7 +/- 9.6, 91.2% were male, and 80.2% had sustained penetrating injuries. the ssi consisted of 65 intra-abdominal collections and 26 wound infections requiring intervention. the most commonly isolated species in the presence of a colonic injury was escherichia coli (64.7%), enterococcus spp. (41.2%), and bacteroides (29.4%), and in the absence of a colonic perforation, enterococcus spp. and enterobacter cloacae (both 38.9%). susceptibility rates of e. coli and e. cloacae, respectively, were 38% and 8% for ampicillin/sulbactam, 82% and 4% for cefazolin, 96% and 92% for cefoxitin, with both 92% to piperacillin/tazobactam, and 100% to  ertapenem. the initial empirical antibiotic therapy adequately targeted the pathogens in 51.6% of patients who developed an ssi. conclusion: the distribution of the microorganisms isolated from ssis differed significantly according to whether or not a colonic injury was present. empiric antibiotic treatment was inadequate in upwards of 50% of patients who developed an ssi. further investigation is warranted to determine the optimal empiric antibiotic regimen for reducing the rate of postoperative ssi.

TI  == a novel polymyxin derivative that lacks the fatty acid tail and carries only three positive charges has strong synergism with agents excluded by the intact outer membrane.
AB  == polymyxins are cationic lipopeptides (five cationic charges) and the last resort  for the treatment of serious gram-negative infections caused by multiresistant strains. nab741 has a cyclic peptide portion identical to that of polymyxin b but carries in the linear peptide portion a threonyl-d-serinyl residue (no cationic charges) instead of the diaminobutyryl-threonyl-diaminobutyryl residue (two cationic charges). at the n terminus of the peptide, nab741 carries an acetyl group instead of a mixture of methyl octanoyl and methyl heptanoyl residues. nab741 sensitized escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae,  and acinetobacter baumannii to antibiotics against which the intact outer membrane is an effective permeability barrier. when tested by using etest strips  on plates containing increasing concentrations of nab741, the fractional inhibition concentration index (fici) of the combination of nab741 with rifampin  ranged from <or=0.111 to 0.158 and that with clarithromycin from <or=0.094 to 0.292. when tested by the checkerboard method, the corresponding fici values against e. coli atcc 25922 were <or=0.141 to <or=0.155 with rifampin and 0.094 with clarithromycin. in addition, at 4 microg/ml, nab741 decreased the mics of azithromycin, mupirocin, fusidic acid, and vancomycin for e. coli strains and e.  cloacae by factors ranging from 8 to 200. a sister peptide, nab752, carrying a threonyl-aminobutyryl residue as the linear peptide portion, was inactive. furthermore, nab741 sensitized e. coli to the bactericidal activity of fresh guinea pig serum. the renal clearance of nab741 was approximately 400-fold, 16-fold, and 8-fold higher than those measured for colistin, nab7061, and nab739, respectively.

TI  == tipsitis: incidence and outcome-a single centre experience.
AB  == introduction: infection of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (tipss) called 'tipsitis' has been reported but appears unusual. we report here our experience of patients who were diagnosed to have tipsitis at our centre. methods: retrospective single centre study. patients identified from a dedicated  data base. patients with tipss with otherwise unexplained sustained bacteraemia were included. results: over 14 years of age, of 785 patients with tipss, eight (1%) had tipsitis. indication for tipss: variceal bleed, seven; refractory ascites, one. child-pugh score: 8.3 (1.4). seven patients had overlapping stents  in situ. duration to tipsitis: 21.6 (7.1) months. at diagnosis, tipss was occluded in four and patent in three. tipsitis developed within 2 weeks of shunt  interventions in two patients and was owing to development of bilio-venous fistula in one. the organisms identified were: lactobacillus rhamnosus, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterococcusfaecium and staphylococcus aureus. median duration of antibiotic therapy: 3 (0.3-3) months. symptoms initially resolved in all but one. symptoms recurred in three and this was related to premature cessation of antibiotics in two. five patients died at a median 1.3 (0.3 to 33) months after tipsitis with tipsitis contributing to death  in three. conclusion: tipsitis is a rare but serious problem. it should be suspected in patients with tipss and unexplained sustained bacteraemia. shunt interventions, where tipss is inserted for variceal bleed, and use of overlapping shunts at tipss insertion may be risk factors for its development. prolonged antibiotics are usually required but tipsitis may recur despite apparently successful treatment.

TI  == the fungal product terreic acid is a covalent inhibitor of the bacterial cell wall biosynthetic enzyme udp-n-acetylglucosamine 1-carboxyvinyltransferase (mura) .
AB  == terreic acid is a metabolite with antibiotic properties produced by the fungus aspergillus terreus. we found that terreic acid is a covalent inhibitor of the bacterial cell wall biosynthetic enzyme mura from enterobacter cloacae and escherichia coli in vitro. the crystal structure of the mura dead-end complex with terreic acid revealed that the quinine ring is covalently attached to the thiol group of cys115, the molecular target of the antibiotic fosfomycin. kinetic characterization established that the inactivation requires the presence of substrate unag (udp-n-acetylglucosamine), proceeding with an inactivation rate constant k(inact) of 130 m(-1) s(-1). although the mechanisms of inactivation are similar, fosfomycin is approximately 50 times more potent than terreic acid, and  the structural consequences of covalent modification by these two inhibitors are  fundamentally different. the mura-fosfomycin complex exists in the closed enzyme  conformation, with the cys115-fosfomycin adduct buried in the active site. in contrast, the dead-end complex with terreic acid is open, is free of unag, and has the cys115-terreic acid adduct solvent-exposed. it appears that terreic acid  reacts with cys115 in the closed, binary state of the enzyme, but that the resulting cys115-terreic acid adduct imposes steric clashes in the active site. as a consequence, the loop containing cys115 rearranges, the enzyme opens, and unag is released. the differential kinetic and structural characteristics of mura inactivation by terreic acid and fosfomycin reflect the importance of noncovalent binding potential, even for covalent inhibitors, in ensuring inactivation efficiency and specificity.

TI  == extended spectrum beta-lactamase detection in gram-negative bacilli of nosocomial origin.
AB  == background: resistance to third generation cephalosporins by acquisition and expression of extended spectrum beta lactamase (esbl) enzymes among gram-negative bacilli is on a rise. the presence of esbl producing organisms significantly affects the course and outcome of an infection and poses a challenge to infection management worldwide. materials and methods: in the period from june 2007 to 2008, we collected 1489 samples from patients suspected of nosocomial infection.  the isolates were identified based on colony morphology and biochemical reaction. gram negative bacilli resistant to third generation cephalosporins were tested for esbl by double disc synergy test (ddst- a screening test)and then phenotypic  confirmatory test. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done by modified kirby bauer disc diffusion method. results: from the sample of 238 gram-negative  bacilli, we isolated escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii and enterobacter cloacae. following both methods, 34% isolates were esbl-positive. the esbl producing isolates were significantly resistant (p < 0.01) to ampicillin, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin as compared to non-esbl producers. multidrug resistance was significantly (p < 0.01) higher (69.14%) in esbl positive isolates than non-esbl isolates (21.66%). conclusion: high prevalence of esbl in our hospital cannot be ignored. esbl producers can be detected by ddst and phenotypic confirmatory test with equal efficacy. the sensitivity of screening test improved with the use of more than one antibiotic and addition of  one or two antibiotics would not increase cost and labor. we recommend ddst using multiple antibiotics in all microbiology units as a routine screening test.

TI  == resistance development profiling of piperacillin in combination with the novel {beta}-lactamase inhibitor bli-489.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate development of resistance to the piperacillin/bli-489 combination. methods: bli-489 was used at a constant concentration of 4 mg/l. spontaneous mutation frequency was measured on piperacillin/bli-489-containing agar plates. five beta-lactamase-producing strains were exposed to a serial dilution of piperacillin/bli-489, and the highest concentration allowing growth was used to inoculate subsequent serial passage for 10 days. mutation stability was monitored in drug-free medium for 10 days. results: escherichia coli (oxa-3,  oxa-7, act-1, shv-1 or none), salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (ctx-m-5),  klebsiella pneumoniae (shv-1 and shv-5) and enterobacter cloacae (ampc) had a spontaneous mutation frequency of < or =1.0 x 10(-9). two ampc-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa strains had a mutation frequency of 6.52 x 10(-6) and 1.0  x 10(-7); a beta-lactamase-negative p. aeruginosa strain had a mutation frequency of 2.68 x 10(-8). the mutant prevention concentration (mpc) was < or =32 mg/l. during serial passages, the mic increased 64- and 128-fold for s. enterica serovar typhimurium (ctx-m-5) and e. cloacae (ampc), respectively, to > or =512 mg/l. the mic reverted to < or =64 mg/l after serial passages in drug-free medium. the mics increased only 4-fold for k. pneumoniae (shv-1 and shv-5), e. coli (oxa-3) and e. coli (shv-1). conclusions: piperacillin/bli-489 demonstrated  a low probability of spontaneous resistance development in vitro for all of the strains tested with the exception of p. aeruginosa. the mpc value for all strains was < or =32 mg/l. resistance developed during serial passage for two of the five strains tested; however, this resistance phenotype was unstable as mic values reverted to < or =64 mg/l after propagation in drug-free medium.

TI  == dispersal of carbapenemase blavim-1 gene associated with different tn402 variants, mercury transposons, and conjugative plasmids in enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == the emergence of bla(vim-1) within four different genetic platforms from distinct enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates in an area with a low prevalence of metallo-beta-lactamase producers is reported. forty-three vim-1-producing isolates (including 19 enterobacter cloacae, 2 escherichia coli,  and 2 p. aeruginosa isolates, 18 klebsiella pneumoniae isolate, and 2 klebsiella  oxytoca isolate) recovered from 2005 to 2007 and corresponding to 15 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis types were studied. the enterobacteriaceae isolates corresponded to a hospital outbreak, and the p. aeruginosa isolates were sporadically recovered. the genetic context of the integrons carrying bla(vim-1)  (arbitrarily designated types a, b, c, and d) was characterized by pcr mapping based on known tn402 and mercury transposons and further sequencing. among enterobacteriaceae isolates, bla(vim-1) was part of integrons located either in an in2-tn402 element linked to tn21 (type a; in110-bla(vim-1)-aaca4-aada1) or in  a tn402 transposon lacking the whole tni module [type b; in113-bla(vim-1)-aaca4-dhfrii (also called dfrb1)-aada1-catb2] and the transposon was associated with an inchi2 or inci1 plasmid, respectively. among p. aeruginosa isolates, bla(vim-1) was part of a new gene cassette array located in a defective tn402 transposon carrying either tnibdelta3 and tnia (type c; bla(vim-1)-aada1) or tnic and deltatniq (type d; bla(vim-1)-aadb), and both tn402 variants were associated with conjugative plasmids of 30 kb. the dissemination of bla(vim-1) was associated with different genetic structures and bacterial hosts, depicting a complex emergence and evolutionary network scenario in our facility, ramon y cajal university hospital, madrid, spain. knowledge of the complex epidemiology of bla(vim-1) is necessary to control this emerging threat.

TI  == [evolution of enterobacteriaceae resistance to antibiotics in reunion island: emergence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases].
AB  == aim of the study: the antibiotic resistance of enterobacteriacae knows a worldwide worrying evolution with an increase of the extended spectrum betalactamases (esbl) that spread into the community. few publications describe this problem in the indian ocean area. the aim of this study is first to identify in felix guyon hospital (reunion island) the emergent antibiotics resistance for  enterobacteriaceae between 1997/1998 and 2006/2007 periods, at second, to update  the prophylactic and therapeutic measures for handling the risk linked to multiresistant enterobacteriaceae in our hospital and third, to assess the risk in reunion island and especially at the community level. methods: the antibiotic  susceptibility of 7814 enterobacteriaceae strains collected among patients, during 1997/1998 and 2006/2007 periods, were analysed as well as the consumption  of the third generation cephalosporins, imipenem and fluoroquinolones. results: within a span of time of 10 years, an important increase (+57 %) of the resistance prevalence of enterobacteriaceae is observed. the resistance by the esbl production mechanism is predominant especially for enterobacter cloacae and  escherichia coli. an important use of broad spectrum antibiotics is correlated with this resistance evolution. conclusion: the emergence of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae in our hospital is impairing both therapeutic and health care. it requires a much better control of antibiotics prescriptions and therefore, an  important multidisciplinary implication. a proof molecular analysis would allow to evaluate the risk more precisely, especially at the community level.

TI  == the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of some medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria.
AB  == background: in effort to identify novel bacterial agents, this study was initiated to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of 17 crude extracts from 12 medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria. methodology: the antimicrobial activities of plant extracts were evaluated against clinically proved beta-lactam-resistant bacteria (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus sp.) and reference strains of bacteria (escherichia coli atcc 35218, enterobacter aerogenes atcc 29751, e. aerogenes atcc 13048, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 and enterococcus hirae atcc 9790) by using disc-diffusion and agar-dilution assays. results: the crude plant extracts demonstrated broad spectrum activity against all bacteria tested with inhibition zones in the range of 8-30 mm. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values of different plant extracts against the tested bacteria were found to range from <or= 0.3 to >or= 10 mg ml(-1). the most active plant extracts were  from dortenia picta and bridelia micrantha (mic: 1.25-10 mg ml(-1)) on beta-lactam-resistant gram-negative bacilli and the extracts from b. micrantha, mallotus oppositifolius, garcinia lucida, garcinia. kola, campylospermum densiflorum (leaves) and c. zenkeri (root) on beta-lactam-resistant gram-positive cocci (mic: <or= 0.3-5 mg ml(-1)). conclusion: of the 17 plant extracts studied,  seven showed good antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria. the stem bark of b. micrantha and the leaves of d. picta were most active towards beta-lactamase producing gram-negative bacilli. this study shows that medicinal plants could be sources of compounds which can be used to fight against beta-lactam resistant bacteria.

TI  == bacterial sepsis after prostate biopsy--a new perspective.
AB  == objectives: to determine the incidence of sepsis following transrectal ultrasound (trus)-guided prostate biopsy at our center. methods: we retrospectively reviewed a group of 24 men who presented with urosepsis after undergoing trus biopsy at our center. results: of the 24 men, 22 were given prophylactic ciprofloxacin. the median time to presentation of sepsis was 1 day after biopsy. the median length of hospitalization was 4 days. escherichia coli was the most frequent cause of urosepsis (67%). variable resistance patterns were observed. enterobacter cloacae and streptococcus viridans were isolated in 2 cases. no bacteria were isolated in 6 cases. two patients who received extensive antibiotic prophylaxis still developed urosepsis. treatment of patients infected with multiresistant anaerobic strains using metronidazole among others, proved successful. high sensitivities toward cefazolin, gentamicin, and tobramycin were observed. the number of cases reported was likely an underestimation, because some patients may have reported to other hospitals and were not captured by this study. in addition, some patients may not have developed infection and urosepsis despite harboring ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria. conclusions: prophylactic ciprofloxacin is still a useful option for the prevention of urosepsis after trus biopsy, as the incidence is relatively low. for the patient who develops urosepsis after trus biopsy, ciprofloxacin resistance needs to be suspected and the treatment regime should be tailored to the resistance profiles of the local region, the patient's  medical history, and the culture and sensitivity reports.

TI  == kinetic and theoretical study of the chalcones as inhibitors of beta-lactamase enzyme.
AB  == staphyloccoccus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae and more bacteria have  shown resistance to antibiotics in colombia, therefore, resistance to antibiotics is a problem that is on increase in colombia. the resistance mechanism to penicillin antibiotics in these bacteria is the expression of beta-lactamase enzyme. in order to use the penicillin antibiotics which are still effective against them, we had evaluated 10 chalcones as inhibitors of this enzyme. the most active chalcone showed k(m') = 406.7 microm higher than clavulanic acid that showed k(m') = 211.9 microm at 37 degrees c during 10 h, and using amoxycillin as substrate. the chalcones were better competitive inhibitors because of they allowed the hydrolysis of smaller quantity of amoxycillin than the clavulanic acid, the most active chalcone showed k(cat)/k(m) = 1.398 (minm)(-1) and the clavulanic acid showed k(cat)/k(m) = 2.674 (minm)(-1). the molecular modelling of the enzyme-chalcones complexes showed that the chalcones with electron-donating groups on ortho, meta position of a ring favour the interaction with the residues threonine-319, lysine-67, serine-64 and tyrosine-150 of the active site of the enzyme, because of the number and strong of hydrogen bonds of the chalcones in the active site of the enzyme increase, and therefore the affinity of the chalcones increases too. the electron-donating groups in the chalcones contribute to their inductive effect improving the interaction with the active site of the enzyme because of rising of electrostatic attraction between them.

TI  == phenotypic characterization of human pathogenic bacteria in fish from the coastal waters of south west cameroon: public health implications.
AB  == increasing economic and recreational opportunities, attractive scenery and a perception of a better quality of life are luring people to the coast. unfortunately, these activities together with the commensurate increase in population in the area inevitably result in pollution of coastal waters with excessive microorganisms and other pollutants. microbial pollutants not only contaminate the coastal water but also aquatic food sources, thus posing a health risk to consumers. fish is a major source of protein in cameroon, especially in the coastal areas. in this study, we investigated the microbiological quality of  fish from the limbe and tiko beaches in south west cameroon from may to october 2007. we isolated human pathogenic bacteria from three anatomic sites (skin, gills, intestine) of 50 fish (150 specimens) and investigated their susceptibility patterns to a battery of antibiotics. data were analyzed statistically using chi2 with significance set at p < .05. eleven bacterial species were identified, including escherichia coli type 1 (20.8%), citrobacter fruendii (16.4%), proteus vulgaris (13%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.1%), klebsiella ozaenae (7.7%), enterobacter cloacae (7.2%), klebsiella oxytoca (5.8%), serratia marcescens (4.8%), serratia odorifera (4.8%), hafnia alvei (4.4%) and proteus penneri (2.9%). more contaminated fish were found at limbe beach than at tiko beach (61.4% versus 38.6%, respectively (p < .05)). when ranking contamination with respect to anatomic site, skin was the most contaminated (40.6%) specimen and gills the least (28.5%). ciprofloxacillin, ofloxacillin, and cotrimoxazole were the most effective antibiotics against all isolates, exhibiting 100% sensitivity. almost half of the isolates (45.7%) were resistant to ampicillin. the results of our study demonstrate that fish from the  coastal waters of south west cameroon are a source of human pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria; hence this finding has public health implications.

TI  == [a clinical study of bile cultures and antibiotic susceptibility test in the patients with operation on biliary tract].
AB  == objective: to illustrate the bacteriology and their susceptibility to antibiotics in patients with biliary tract diseases and provide information for antibiotic choices. methods: the bile specimens were cultured and pathogens' susceptibility  to antibiotics was obtained intraoperatively from 195 patients undergoing operations on biliary tract and 24 healthy liver donors from june 2007 to march 2008. results: among 195 bile specimens collected from the patients intraoperatively, 44 ones were found bacterial growth by culture (22.6%), in which 11 ones were mixed infections (25.0%). fifty-five bacterial strains belonging to 16 species were identified from these bile specimens. they included  34 gram negative strains (61.8%), 19 gram positive strains (34.6%) and 2 fungal strains (3.6%). the commonest pathogens were escherichia coli (27.3%), enterobacter cloacae (12.7%), enterococcus faecalis (12.7%) and enterococcus faecium (10.9%). among 24 bile specimens collected from the healthy liver donors, one was found escherichia coli growth by culture (4.2%). the results of susceptibility test showed that the resistant rates of gram negative strains to meropenem was 2.8%, followed by imipenem (5.6%), sulperazone (22.8%) and amikacin (28.7%). in this study gram negative strains were highly resistant to penicillins, quinolones, some third generation cephalosporins and so on (>50.0%). none of gram positive strains were resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin. they  were highly resistant to penicillins, quinolones, clindamycin and so on (>40.0%). conclusions: (1) gram negative strains remain the commonest pathogens in biliary  tract infection in renji hospital and the commonest pathogen is escherichia coli. the infection of enterococcus is going up. the mixed infection cases happen mostly in acute biliary infection. (2) to treat biliary infection the broad-spectrum antibiotics which are effective to escherichia coli are optimal choices. ceftazidime or ciprofloxacin may be used in mild biliary infection. sulperazone or amikacin may be used in severe biliary infection. imipenem and vancomycins may be used as second choice to treat the infection which other drugs are ineffective to.

TI  == detection of plasmid-mediated imp-1 metallo-beta-lactamase and quinolone resistance determinants in an ertapenem-resistant enterobacter cloacae isolate.
AB  == objective: to investigate the mechanism of carbapenem resistance and the occurrence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants qnr and aac(6')-ib-cr in a clinical isolate of enterobacter cloacae. methods: an ertapenem-resistant e. cloacae zy106, which was isolated from liquor puris of a female gastric cancer patient in a chinese hospital, was investigated. antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by agar dilution method. conjugation experiments, isoelectric focusing, polymerase chain reaction (pcr), and dna sequence analyses of plasmid-mediated carbapenemases and quinolone resistance determinants were preformed to confirm the genotype. outer membrane proteins (omps) were examined by urea-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (urea-sds-page). results: minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem for zy106 were 2, 4, and 16 microg/ml, respectively. conjugation studies with escherichia coli resulted in the transfer of significantly reduced carbapenem susceptibility. zy106 produced imp-1 metallo-beta-lactamase and ctx-m-3 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, and e. coli transconjugant produced imp-1. plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinant qnrs1 was detected in zy106. transfer of the qnrs1-encoding-plasmid into e. coli by conjugation resulted in intermediate resistance to ciprofloxacin  in e. coli transconjugant. urea-sds-page analysis of omps showed that zy106 lacked an omp of approximately 38 kda. conclusion: it is the first imp-1-producing enterobacteriaceae in china and the first report of a clinical isolate that harbors both blaimp and qnrs genes as well. the blaimp-1, blactx-m-3, and qnrs1 are encoded at three different plasmids. imp-1 combined with the loss of an omp possibly resulted in ertapenem resistance and reduced imipenem and meropenem susceptibility in e. cloacae.

TI  == can we rely on one laboratory test in detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae? an evaluation of the vitek 2 system and comparison with four other detection methods in kuwait.
AB  == background and aims: clinical hospitals need to correctly identify extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing bacteria in infected patients to correctly treat the patient and avoid spreading antibiotic resistance. kuwaiti hospitals use one laboratory test for detecting esbl bacteria. this study evaluated whether that was sufficient to detect esbl bacteria, and compared the vitek system with other detection systems. methods: (klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, k oxytoca and enterobacter cloacae) were collected from five different kuwaiti main hospitals, all of which were flagged as esbl-positive by the vitek 2 system. the isolates were retested by the vitek 2 system, and were also tested by double disc diffusion (ddd), the disc approximation test, the e-test and the microscan system for the detection of esbls. results: retesting with the vitek system revealed 100% compatibility with the results of the source  hospitals. the microscan system, ddd, disc approximation test and e-test could detect esbl in 199, 192, 178 and 205 isolates, respectively. conclusions: technically, the microscan and vitek 2 systems were the least demanding method to detect esbl as it is an integral part of the routine susceptibility test card. e-test strips were reliable but the most expensive of all techniques used. the ddd test and disc approximation, while relatively inexpensive, were technically subjective. the vitek system may be very suitable in clinical laboratories, but would be better if accompanied with another test for detection of esbl bacteria.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline alone and in combination against clinical isolates of resistant gram-negative pathogens, including beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == ceftaroline is a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin that exhibits bactericidal activity against many gram-positive and -negative pathogens. however, the activity of ceftaroline cannot be solely relied upon for eradication of multidrug-resistant gram-negative isolates, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae, which represent a current clinical concern. as drug combinations might be beneficial by potential synergy, we evaluated the in vitro activity of ceftaroline combined with meropenem, aztreonam, cefepime, tazobactam, amikacin, levofloxacin, and tigecycline. susceptibility testing was performed for 20 clinical p. aeruginosa isolates, 10 esbl-producing escherichia coli isolates, 10 esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, and 10 ampc-derepressed enterobacter cloacae isolates. time-kill experiments were performed for 10 isolates using antimicrobials at one-fourth the mic. ceftaroline exhibited a mic range of 0.125  to 1,024 microg/ml and was reduced 2- to 512-fold by combination with tazobactam  (4 microg/ml) for esbl-producing strains. in time-kill experiments, ceftaroline plus amikacin was synergistic against 90% of the isolates (and indifferent for one p. aeruginosa isolate). ceftaroline plus tazobactam was indifferent for e. cloacae and p. aeruginosa strains but synergistic against 100% of e. coli and k.  pneumoniae isolates. combinations of ceftaroline plus meropenem or aztreonam were also synergistic for all e. coli and e. cloacae isolates, respectively, but indifferent against 90% of the other isolates. finally, combinations of ceftaroline plus either tigecycline, levofloxacin, or cefepime were indifferent for 100% of the isolates. no antagonism was observed with any combination. ceftaroline plus amikacin appeared as the most likely synergistic combination. this represents a promising therapeutic option, and further studies are warranted to elucidate the clinical value of ceftaroline combinations against resistant gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == multidrug efflux systems in escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae obtained from wholesome broiler carcasses.
AB  == members of the enterobacteriaceae family are present in the intestines of man and animals as commensals or are important disease causing agents. bacteria bearing multidrug efflux systems (mdr) are able to survive adverse ecological niches. multiresistant escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae isolates from wholesome  broiler carcasses were investigated for the presence of mdr. lowering of minimal  inhibitory concentration for antimicrobials in the presence of a proton-motive force (pmf) uncoupler was tested as a potential display of the mdr phenotype. pcr amplification of the genes encoding acra and acrb, components of a mdr system was performed. diversity of each species was ascertained by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) of dna digested with endonuclease xbai. for all the isolates, except e. coli 1 and e. cloacae 9, lowering of mic or of the growth rate in the presence of antimicrobials was observed, indicating a pmf dependent resistance mechanism. expected products of dna amplification with acrab derived primers was obtained with all e. coli strains and with two of the five e. cloacae strains. dendrogram generated shows diverse pulsetypes, confirming the genetic diversity among the strains. an important issue and related public health is the  fact that different models and mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance are present in a small number of non-pathogenic strains and isolated from the same origin. these may be sources of resistance genes to others microorganisms, among them, pathogenic strains.

TI  == identification of novel antibacterial peptides by chemoinformatics and machine learning.
AB  == the rise of antibiotic resistant pathogens is one of the most pressing global health issues. discovery of new classes of antibiotics has not kept pace; new agents often suffer from cross-resistance to existing agents of similar structure. short, cationic peptides with antimicrobial activity are essential to  the host defenses of many organisms and represent a promising new class of antimicrobials. this paper reports the successful in silico screening for potent  antibiotic peptides using a combination of qsar and machine learning techniques.  on the basis of initial high-throughput measurements of activity of over 1400 random peptides, artificial neural network models were built using qsar descriptors and subsequently used to screen an in silico library of approximately 100,000 peptides. in vitro validation of the modeling showed 94% accuracy in identifying highly active peptides. the best peptides identified through screening were found to have activities comparable or superior to those of four conventional antibiotics and superior to the peptide most advanced in clinical development against a broad array of multiresistant human pathogens.

AB  == the emergence and rapid dissemination of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing isolates among enterobacteriaceae coupled with increasing prevalence of stably derepressed and plasmid-borne ampc producers have rendered broad-spectrum cephalosporins and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations less effective. this scenario has required the use of carbapenems for treatment of infections caused by such organisms. in this study, the in vitro activities of doripenem and comparator agents against enterobacteriaceae, including esbl- and ampc-producing strains, were evaluated. a total of 36 614 isolates collected from more than 60 medical centers (2000-2007) were included and tested for susceptibility using reference methods and interpretive criteria,  except for doripenem (product package insert). overall, doripenem inhibited 98.7% of all enterobacteriaceae tested at <or=0.5 microg/ml. esbl rates were higher among klebsiella pneumoniae (from 7.7% to 44.0%, varied by geographic region), followed by escherichia coli (3.6-14.0%) and proteus mirabilis (0.8-34.8%). derepressed ampc production-mediated resistance rates were highest among enterobacter cloacae (26.6-38.7%) compared with other species and generally higher for strains isolated in the asia-pacific and latin american regions. doripenem inhibited 94.3% and 93.7% of the esbl phenotype and derepressed ampc isolates, respectively, and these resistances had little adverse influence on doripenem mic(50) values (nil to 2-fold increases). the observed increase in ampc- and esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae necessitates a greater confidence on  carbapenem empiric therapy. doripenem could represent a valuable choice for broad-spectrum coverage of contemporary enterobacteriaceae isolates with widespread resistance mechanisms.

TI  == isothiocyanate profile and selective antibacterial activity of root, stem, and leaf extracts derived from raphanus sativus l.
AB  == acetone and hexane extracts derived from the root, stem, and leaf of raphanus sativus were investigated for their antibacterial activity against foodborne and  resistant pathogens, such as bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, and escherichia coli. total and individual isothiocyanate (itc) components and their relationship with the antibacterial activity of r. sativus were also evaluated. both acetone and hexane fractions of root, stem, and leaf exhibited selective antibacterial activity against the organisms tested. antibacterial activity was strongest in the acetone fraction of root with larger zone of inhibition and lower minimum inhibitory concentration. the results obtained were comparable to that seen with standard antibiotics. of the different parts of r. sativus studied, root tended to be more active than the stem and leaf extracts in inhibiting the bacterial growth. gas chromatographic analysis revealed the presence of variable amounts of five different itcs such as allyl isothiocyanate (aitc), phenyl isothiocyanate (pitc), benzyl isothiocyanate (bitc), phenethyl isothiocyanate, and 4-(methylthio)-3-butenyl isothiocyanate (mtbitc) in different parts of the plant. the low linear correlation between the total itc content and antibacterial activity implied that bacterial growth inhibitory ability of r. sativus was not dependent on the total itc content. however, the antibacterial activity of r. sativus was well correlated with aitc, pitc, and bitc for all organisms except for enteroc. faecalis, whose inhibitory effect was more related to mtbitc.

TI  == changes in bacterial isolates from burn wounds and their antibiograms: a 20-year  study (1986-2005).
AB  == background: our aim is to elucidate shifts in the bacterial spectrum colonising burn wounds and corresponding antibiotic susceptibilities during a 20-year study  period. methods: microbiological results from burn patients collected between 1986 and 2005 were analysed retrospectively. results: staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (20.8%), followed by escherichia coli (13.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (10.9%), enterococcus sp. (9.7%), enterobacter cloacae (5.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5%), acinetobacter sp. (3.2%), proteus mirabilis (2%) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.4%). susceptibility of s. aureus to broad-spectrum substances such as ciprofloxacin or penicillinase-stable penicillins has waned, others such as cotrimoxazole or netilmicin remained effective. not a single resistance against vancomycin was recorded. increases in methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) were pronounced (3% in 1986-1997 (the first of the three study periods) to 16% in 1998-2001 and 13% in 2002-2005). results for methicillin-resistant cns (mrcns) show an even greater increase. p. aeruginosa has shown increasing susceptibility  against netilmicin (1986-1989: 84%, 2002-2005: 95%). susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to ceftazidime has decreased markedly. s. maltophilia has shown clinically relevant susceptibility mainly against ciprofloxacin. acinetobacter sp. have shown little susceptibility to most antibiotics. imipenem or meropenem have been very reliable reserve antibiotics throughout the study period for the fermenting enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae and p. mirabilis), with susceptibilities of or near 100%. conclusion: in-depth knowledge of the bacteria causing infectious complications and of their antibiotic susceptibilities is a prerequisite for treating burn patients. our study shows shifts in the microbial spectrum and their antibiogram, which mandate frequent reassessments.

TI  == generation of antibacterial oligosaccharides derived from chitin using heterologous endochitinase synthesized in escherichia coli.
AB  == aims: to synthesize two heterologous endochitinases in escherichia coli and demonstrate their potential for applied use in generating antibacterial chitin-derived oligosaccharides (ogs). methods and results: heterologous endochitinase genes, chia nima and chia74, were expressed in e. coli. endochitinases were secreted by the e. coli export machinery and by approximately 20 h maximal chitinolytic activity was observed. the highest chitinolytic activity was observed with chia nima, which produced antibacterial ogs with activities against enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus  and s. xylosus. conclusions: it was shown that the export machinery of e. coli is well suited for the secretion of bioactive chia74 and chia nima endochitinases, and that the latter can generate antibacterial ogs. significance and impact of the study: our study suggests that it is feasible to synthesize endochitinases chia nima and chia74 codified by e. coli and mass-produce these enzymes in culture supernatants. as signal peptides in native chia nima and chia74 were recognized by the protein export molecular apparatus in e. coli, these short peptides could be included as signal sequences for transport in e. coli of other  proteins with applied value. this is the first report suggesting that chia nima can be used to produce ogs to control food-borne pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == ampc beta-lactamases.
AB  == summary: ampc beta-lactamases are clinically important cephalosporinases encoded  on the chromosomes of many of the enterobacteriaceae and a few other organisms, where they mediate resistance to cephalothin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, most penicillins, and beta-lactamase inhibitor-beta-lactam combinations. in many bacteria, ampc enzymes are inducible and can be expressed at high levels by mutation. overexpression confers resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins including cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone and is a problem especially in infections due to enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter cloacae, where an isolate initially susceptible to these agents may become resistant upon therapy.  transmissible plasmids have acquired genes for ampc enzymes, which consequently can now appear in bacteria lacking or poorly expressing a chromosomal bla(ampc) gene, such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis. resistance due to plasmid-mediated ampc enzymes is less common than extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production in most parts of the world but may be both harder to detect and broader in spectrum. ampc enzymes encoded by both chromosomal and plasmid genes are also evolving to hydrolyze broad-spectrum cephalosporins more efficiently. techniques to identify ampc beta-lactamase-producing isolates are available but are still evolving and are not yet optimized for the clinical laboratory, which probably now underestimates  this resistance mechanism. carbapenems can usually be used to treat infections due to ampc-producing bacteria, but carbapenem resistance can arise in some organisms by mutations that reduce influx (outer membrane porin loss) or enhance  efflux (efflux pump activation).

TI  == biologically active and c-amidated hinnavinii-38-asn produced from a trx fusion construct in escherichia coli.
AB  == the cabbage butterfly (artogeia rapae) antimicrobial peptide hinnavinii as a member of cecropin family is synthesized as 37 residues in size with an amidated  lysine at c-terminus and shows the humoral immune response to a bacterial invasion. in this work, a synthetic gene for hinnavinii-38-asn (hin) with an additional amino acid asparagine residue containing amide group at c-terminus was cloned into pet-32a(+) vector to allow expression of hin as a trx fusion protein  in escherichia coli strain bl21 (de3) plyss. the resulting expression level of the fusion protein trx-hin could reach 15-20% of the total cell proteins and more than 70% of the target proteins were in soluble form. the fusion protein could be purified successfully by hitrap chelating hp column and a high yield of 15 mg purified fusion protein was obtained from 80 ml e. coli culture. recombinant hin  was readily obtained by enterokinase cleavage of the fusion protein followed by fplc chromatography, and 3.18 mg pure active recombinant hin was obtained from 80 ml culture. the molecular mass of recombinant hin determined by maldi-tof mass spectrometer is 4252.084 da which matches the theoretical mass (4252.0 da) of hin. comparing the antimicrobial activities of the recombinant hinnavinii with c-amidated terminus to that without an amidated c-terminus, we found that the amide of asparagine at c-terminus of hinnavinii improved its potency on certain microorganism such as e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, bacillus megaterium, and staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == pathogen prevalence and influence of composted dairy manure application on antimicrobial resistance profiles of commensal soil bacteria.
AB  == composting manure, if done properly, should kill pathogenic bacteria such as salmonella and escherichia coli o157:h7, providing for an environmentally safe product. over a 3-year period, samples of composted dairy manure, representing 11 composting operations (two to six samples per producer; 100 total samples), were  screened for salmonella and e. coli o157:h7 and were all culture negative. nonpathogenic bacteria were cultured from these compost samples that could theoretically facilitate the spread of antimicrobial resistance from the dairy to compost application sites. therefore, we collected soil samples (three samples per plot; 10 plots/treatment; 90 total samples) from rangeland that received either composted dairy manure (cp), commercial fertilizer (f), or no treatment (control, con). two collections were made appoximately 2 and 7 months following treatment application. soil samples were cultured for pseudomonas and enterobacter and confirmed isolates subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing. three species of enterobacter (cloacae, 27 isolates; aeroginosa, two isolates; sakazakii, one isolate) and two species of pseudomonas (aeruginosa, 11  isolates; putida, seven isolates) were identified. five enterobacter isolates were resistant to ampicillin and one isolate was resistant to spectinomycin. all  pseudomonas isolates were resistant to ampicillin, ceftiofur, florfenicol, sulphachloropyridazine, sulphadimethoxine, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and  most isolates were resistant to chlortetracycline and spectinomycin. pseudomonas  isolates were resistant to an average of 8.6, 7.9, and 8 antibiotics for con, cp, and f treatments, respectively. no treatment differences were observed in antimicrobial resistance patterns in any of the soil isolates examined. results reported herein support the use of composted dairy manure as an environmentally friendly soil amendment.

TI  == summer peaks in the incidences of gram-negative bacterial infection among hospitalized patients.
AB  == objective: recognition of seasonal trends in hospital infections may improve diagnosis, use of empirical therapy, and infection prevention interventions. there are very few data available regarding the seasonal variability of these infections. we quantified the seasonal variation in the incidences of hospital infection caused by common bacterial pathogens and estimated the association between temperature changes and infection rates. methods: a cohort of all adult patients admitted to the university of maryland medical center during the period  from 1998 through 2005 was analyzed. time-series analyses were used to estimate the association of the number of infections per month caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococci with season and temperature, while controlling for long-term trends. results: there were 218,594 admissions to the index hospital, and analysis of 26,624 unique clinical cultures that grew the organisms of interest identified increases in the mean monthly rates of infection caused by p. aeruginosa (28% of isolates recovered; p ! .01), e. cloacae (46%; p  ! .01), e. coli (12%; p ! .01), and a. baumannii (21%; pp.06). for each 10 degrees f increase, we observed a 17% increase in the monthly rates of infection  caused by p. aeruginosa (pp.01) and a. baumanii (pp.05). conclusion: significantly higher rates of gram-negative infection were observed during the summer months, compared with other seasons. for some pathogens, higher temperatures were associated with higher infection rates, independent of seasonality. these findings have important implications for infection prevention, such as enhanced surveillance during the warmer months, and for choice of empirical antimicrobial therapy among hospitalized adults. future, quasi-experimental investigations of gram-negative infection prevention initiatives should control for seasonal variation.

TI  == transfer of antibiotic multiresistant plasmid rp4 from escherichia coli to activated sludge bacteria.
AB  == in situ transfer of a self-transmissible, antibiotic-multiresistant plasmid rp4 from a laboratory escherichia coli strain c600 to indigenous activated sludge bacteria was investigated using filter mating. the transfer frequency of rp4 from the donor e. coli to the bacteria that was sampled from two wastewater treatment  plants was 5.1x10(-2) to 7.5x10(-1) and 4.6x10(-3) to 1.3x10(-2)/potential recipient. the isolated transconjugants showed resistance to ap, km, and tc and the presence of a plasmid with a similar size to rp4. the trag gene on rp4 was also detected from all transconjugants. reverse-transfer experiments from the transconjugants to e. coli hb101 indicated that rp4 maintained self-transmissibility in the transconjugants. the transconjugant strains were dominant bacteria in activated sludge including pseudomonas fluorescens, p. putida, and ochrobactrum anthropi and minor populations of enteric bacterial strains including citrobacter freundii, e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, e. asburiae, and klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae. the transconjugant strains k. pneumoniae ssp. pneumonia, e. cloacae, and e. asburiae had several naturally occurring plasmids. these results suggest that in situ transfer of plasmids and the exchange of antibiotic-resistant genes can occur between released and indigenous bacteria in activated sludge.

AB  == tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from april 2006 to march 2007 were investigated in a multicenter study in  japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 474 strains including 23 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 170 (75.2%) of 226 patients with surgical infections. two hundred and twenty-six strains were isolated from primary infections, and 224 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from postoperative infections aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of staphylococcus spp. was higher from postoperative infections, while enterococcus spp. was higher from primary infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and e. cloacae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by bacteroides fragilis and from postoperative infections, b. fragilis was most predominately isolated, followed by bacteroides caccae, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and b. wadsworthia in this order. in this series, we noticed no  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, nor multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa. there were three strains of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative  staphylococcus aureus, but all of them had good susceptibilities against various  anti-mrsa antibiotics. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia.

TI  == growth, encystment and survival of acanthamoeba castellanii grazing on different  bacteria.
AB  == free-living amoebae of the genus acanthamoeba are widely distributed in soil and  water collections, where trophozoites (vegetative, multiplicative stages) feed mainly by phagocytosis and thus control bacterial populations in the environment. here, we examined the growth, encystment and survival of acanthamoeba castellanii receiving different bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, bacillus subtilis, bacillus megaterium, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus) in nonnutrient saline. all bacteria assayed induced a  dose-dependent proliferative response, in most cases maximized with a bacterial dose of 1 x 10(9) ml(-1); except for m. luteus, trophozoites grew better with viable than with heat-killed bacteria. in addition, acanthamoeba growth was improved by adding bacteria on alternate days. single-dose experiments indicated  a temporal association between the growth of trophozoite and bacterial consumption, and higher consumption of m. luteus, e. coli and p. aeruginosa, bacterial species that allowed the highest trophozoite yields. long-term acanthamoeba-bacteria incubation revealed that encystment was significantly delayed by almost all the bacteria assayed (including s. aureus, which elicited a poor growth response) and that the presence of bacteria markedly increased cyst yield; final cyst recovery clearly depended on both the dose and the type of the  bacterium given, being much higher with e. coli, m. luteus and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == role of menaquinone biosynthesis genes in selenate reduction by enterobacter cloacae sld1a-1 and escherichia coli k12.
AB  == in this study, we investigated the role of menaquinone biosynthesis genes in selenate reduction by enterobacter cloacae sld1a-1 and escherichia coli k12. a mini-tn5 transposon mutant of e. cloacae sld1a-1, designated as 4e6, was isolated that had lost the ability to reduce se(vi) to se(0). genetic analysis of mutant strain 4e6 showed that the transposon was inserted within a mend gene among a menfdhbce gene cluster that encodes for proteins required for menaquinone biosynthesis. a group of e. coli k12 strains with single mutations in the menf, mend, menc and mene genes were tested for loss of selenate reduction activity. the results showed that e. coli k12 carrying a deletion of either the mend, menc  or mene gene was unable to reduce selenate. complementation using wild-type sequences of the e. cloacae sld1a-1 menfdhbce sequence successfully restored the  selenate reduction activity in mutant strain 4e6, and e. coli k12 mend and mene mutants. selenate reduction activity in 4e6 was also restored by chemical complementation using the menaquinone precursor compound 1,4-dihydroxy-2-nathphoic acid. the results of this work suggest that menaquinones are an important source of electrons for the selenate reductase, and are required for selenate reduction activity in e. cloacae sld1a-1 and e. coli k12.

TI  == high prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes qnr and aac(6')-ib-cr in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae from nine teaching hospitals in china.
AB  == quinolone resistance is an emerging problem in china. to investigate the prevalence of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes qnr and aac(6')-ib-cr, a total of 265 clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, and enterobacter cloacae with ciprofloxacin mics of > or =0.25 microg/ml were screened at nine teaching hospitals in china. the qnra, qnrb, qnrs, and aac(6')-ib genes were detected by pcr. the aac(6')-ib-cr gene was further identified by digestion with btsci and/or direct sequencing. the qnr gene was present in significantly smaller numbers of isolates with cefotaxime mics of <2 microg/ml than isolates with higher mics (> or =2.0 microg/ml) (20.6% and 42.1%, respectively; p < 0.05). aac(6')-ib-cr was present in 17.0% of the isolates tested, and 7.9% of the isolates carried both the qnr and the aac(6')-ib-cr genes. among the isolates with cefotaxime mics of > or =2.0 microg/ml, qnr and aac(6')-ib-cr were present in 65.7% and 8.6% of e. cloacae isolates, respectively; 65.5% and 21.8% of k. pneumoniae isolates, respectively;  63.3% and 26.7% of c. freundii isolates, respectively; and 6.5% and 16.9% of e. coli isolates, respectively. the 20 transconjugants showed 16- to 128-fold increases in ciprofloxacin mics, 14 showed 16- to 2,000-fold increases in cefotaxime mics, and 5 showed 8- to 32-fold increases in cefoxitin mics relative  to those of the recipient due to the cotransmission of bla(ctx-m-14), bla(ctx-m-3), bla(dha-1), bla(shv-2), and bla(shv-12) with the qnr and aac(6')-ib-cr genes. southern hybridization analysis showed that these genes were located on large plasmids of different sizes (53 to 193 kb). these findings indicate the high prevalence of qnr and aac(6')-ib-cr in members of the family enterobacteriaceae and the widespread dissemination of multidrug resistance in china.

TI  == aromatic amino acid-dependent expression of indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase is regulated by tyrr in enterobacter cloacae uw5.
AB  == the plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium enterobacter cloacae uw5 synthesizes the plant growth hormone indole-3-acetic acid (iaa) via the indole-3-pyruvate pathway utilizing the enzyme indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase that is encoded by ipdc. in this bacterium, ipdc expression and iaa production occur in stationary phase and are induced by an exogenous source of tryptophan, conditions that are present in the rhizosphere. the aim of this study was to identify the regulatory  protein that controls the expression of ipdc. we identified a sequence in the promoter region of ipdc that is highly similar to the recognition sequence for the escherichia coli regulatory protein tyrr that regulates genes involved in aromatic amino acid transport and metabolism. using a tyrr insertional mutant, we demonstrate that tyrr is required for iaa production and for induction of ipdc transcription. tyrr directly induces ipdc expression, as was determined by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-pcr, by ipdc promoter-driven reporter gene activity, and by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. expression  increases in response to tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine. this suggests that, in addition to its function in plant growth promotion, indolepyruvate decarboxylase may be important for aromatic amino acid uptake and/or metabolism.

TI  == susceptibility of common aerobic pathogens to tigecycline: results of a surveillance study in germany.
AB  == tigecycline is a novel antimicrobial agent for parenteral use encompassing a broad spectrum of bacterial pathogens, including multi-resistant organisms. here, we report the results of the first nationwide surveillance trial that was conducted in order to evaluate the susceptibility of bacterial isolates to tigecycline in a european country prior to its clinical use. a total of 2,610 gram-positive and gram-negative organisms recovered from hospitalized patients were tested. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined using the microdilution method. all enterococci, staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus; mrsa), and streptococci tested were  tigecycline-susceptible, except one isolate of staphylococcus haemolyticus. among the gram-negative bacteria, 100% of the escherichia coli isolates (including extended spectrum beta-lactamase [esbl]-producers) were tigecycline-susceptible,  while about 10% of the enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were resistant. based on the results of this surveillance study, tigecycline may  represent a suitable option most notably for the empiric treatment of bacterial mixed infections, including in clinical situations in which multi-resistant organisms are suspected.

TI  == pharmacodynamic assessment of doripenem in peritoneal fluid against gram-negative organisms: use of population pharmacokinetic modeling and monte carlo simulation.
AB  == this study aimed to assess the peritoneal pharmacodynamics of intravenous doripenem using population pharmacokinetic modeling and monte carlo simulation. drug concentrations in peritoneal fluid (pf) and serum from 11 laparotomy patients and mic distributions against clinical isolates in japan for 4 gram-negative organisms were used. the probabilities of attaining the pharmacodynamic target (40% t > mic) were greater in pf than in serum. to achieve a > or =90% probability of target attainment in pf, 0.25 g tid and 0.5 g tid (0.5-h infusions) had to be sufficient against escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., and enterobacter cloacae; however, 1 g tid (0.5-h infusion) was required against  pseudomonas aeruginosa. prolonged (4-h) infusion regimens resulted in increase of the target attainment probabilities in pf for p. aeruginosa. these results should help to achieve a better understanding of the peritoneal pharmacodynamics of doripenem while also helping to rationalize and optimize the dosing regimen for intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == molecular characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases produced by clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae from a teaching hospital in china.
AB  == of 59 clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae from a teaching hospital in sichuan, china, 18 isolates were shown to be resistant to oxyimino cephalosporins and aztreonam. enterobacterial repetitive consensus pcr revealed that these isolates comprised 7 distinct genotypes. the presence of plasmids in the 18 clinical isolates was revealed by conjugational transfer of plasmids from e. cloacae to escherichia coli with the further isolation of the plasmids in the transconjugants. subsequent nucleotide sequencing and beta-lactamase isoelectric  focusing indicated that the plasmids encoded blashv, blactx-m and/or blatem genes, including genes for ctx-m-22 (13 strains), tem-1 (12 strains), tem-29 (1 strain), tem-141 (1 strain), tem-157 (1 strain), shv-5 (1 strain), shv-12 (1 strain), and shv-70 (1 strain). the widespread presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in e. cloacae isolated from the southwest of china was likely due to the dissemination of resistance plasmids with the predominant genotype of blactx-m-22.

TI  == genetic and structural insights into the dissemination potential of the extremely broad-spectrum class a beta-lactamase kpc-2 identified in an escherichia coli strain and an enterobacter cloacae strain isolated from the same patient in france.
AB  == two clinical strains of escherichia coli (2138) and enterobacter cloacae (7506) isolated from the same patient in france and showing resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and low susceptibility to imipenem were investigated. both strains harbored the plasmid-contained bla(tem-1) and bla(kpc-2) genes. bla(kluc-2), encoding a mutant of the chromosomal beta-lactamase of kluyvera cryocrescens, was also identified at a plasmid location in e. cloacae 7506, suggesting the isecp1-assisted escape of bla(kluc) from the chromosome. determination of the kpc-2 structure at 1.6 a revealed that  the binding site was occupied by the c-terminal (c-ter) residues coming from a symmetric kpc-2 monomer, with the ultimate c-ter glu interacting with ser130, lys234, thr235, and thr237 in the active site. this mode of binding can be paralleled to the inhibition of the tem-1 beta-lactamase by the inhibitory protein blip. determination of the 1.23-a structure of a kpc-2 mutant in which the five c-ter residues were deleted revealed that the catalytic site was filled  by a citrate molecule. structure analysis and docking simulations with cefotaxime and imipenem provided further insights into the molecular basis of the extremely  broad spectrum of kpc-2, which behaves as a cefotaximase with significant activity against carbapenems. in particular, residues 104, 105, 132, and 167 draw a binding cavity capable of accommodating both the aminothiazole moiety of cefotaxime and the 6 alpha-hydroxyethyl group of imipenem, with the binding of the former drug being also favored by a significant degree of freedom at the level of the loop at positions 96 to 105 and by an enlargement of the binding site at the end of strand beta 3.

TI  == the culture site of the gallbladder affects recovery of bacteria in symptomatic cholelithiasis.
AB  == aim: traditional methods for bile culturing may miss a large number of underlying bacterial infections that could lead to acute or chronic cholecystitis. aim: to evaluate possible differences regarding the site of material collection and thus  to detect the most suitable sample site for gallbladder culture. methods: a cohort of 137 patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis was enrolled. after surgical excision of the gallbladder, bile cultures were separately performed from fundus, body and neck. identification of bacteria as well as computation of  mean bacterial concentrations were performed with standard microbiological techniques. wilcoxon's paired and chi-square tests were used for comparison between continuous and discrete parameters, respectively. results: thirty-one patients (22.6%) demonstrated at least one positive culture sample. positivity was 31/31 (100.0%) in neck samples, 20/31 (64.5%) in body and 13/31 (41.9%) in fundus samples (p<0.001). the microorganisms identified were escherichia coli (14 cases) and enterococcus faecalis (10 cases), followed by staphylococcus aureus (3 cases), pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecium, enterobacter aerogenes and  enterobacter cloacae (1 case each). mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the neck (272.2 +/- 187.5) were higher (p<0.01) when compared to those derived from both the body (38.2 +/- 28.7) and the fundus (12.5 +/- 11.3). mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the body were higher (p<0.01) than those derived from the fundus. conclusion: the neck of the gallbladder hosts the biggest bacterial load in comparison with the body and the fundus. this difference might be attributed to the presence of rokitansky-aschoff sinuses, which is the main histological characteristic of the  region.

TI  == influence of extended-spectrum beta-lactams on gram-negative bacterial resistance.
AB  == purpose: the influence of extended- spectrum beta-lactams on gram-negative bacterial resistance was studied. methods: hospital pharmacists were asked to provide data on antimicrobial use and bacterial susceptibilities. defined daily doses per 1000 patient-days of cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam were assessed for significant associations with gram-negative susceptibility. to account for midyear changes in usage patterns and the lag between changes in usage and resistance, susceptibility over two-year periods was evaluated. results: susceptibility data of more than 300,000 gram-negative isolates, representing 10 species of interest, were provided by 82  u.s. hospitals. two-year periods (n = 45) were evaluable for 25 hospitals, containing 159 hospital-years of data and 204,513 clinical isolates. use of cefepime increased, while use of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam decreased. excluding pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteria were most susceptible to cefepime, followed by piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime. significantly decreased susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria to the antibiotics themselves were observed with ceftazidime (enterobacter aerogenes) and ceftriaxone (escherichia coli). extended-spectrum beta-lactams associated with significantly decreased susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria to other beta-lactams included cefepime (e. aerogenes and e. coli susceptibility to ceftazidime), ceftazidime (enterobacter cloacae susceptibility to cefepime), ceftriaxone (e. cloacae susceptibility to cefepime), piperacillin-tazobactam (e. cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and p. aeruginosa susceptibility to cefepime). there were insufficient susceptibility data to allow for impact analysis for piperacillin-tazobactam. conclusion: use of cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam was associated with variably changing susceptibilities of several key gram-negative bacteria, either to themselves or to each other. despite the increased use of cefepime, gram-negative bacterial susceptibility to cefepime remained high.

AB  == the plasmid-borne quinolone resistance gene qnra1 is prevalent in multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae. a chromosomally encoded homologue in shewanella algae, qnra3, has been described. we isolated two qnra3-positive strains, one of klebsiella pneumoniae (he96) and one of kluyvera ascorbata (kas96), from the feces of an immunocompromised outpatient. the qnra3 allele was  identical to that of s. algae except for 5 nucleotides and differed from qnra1 by 29 nucleotides affecting three amino acids. the analysis of the qnra3 genetic environment showed that qnra3 was inserted downstream from an iscr1 element at a  recombination crossover site described for other resistance genes, including qnra1, and immediately upstream from is26, a situation not described before. is26 preceded an incomplete class 1 integron which contained, among other genes, aac(6')-ib-cr, another transferable quinolone resistance gene, and the beta-lactamase gene bla(oxa-1/30). the 10-kb fragment encompassing qnra3 was compared to previously described qnra1-containing plasmids and multidrug-resistant plasmids; it shares identical sequences with pc15a, phsh2, pqr1, pqkp311h, and psal-1 but with rearrangements, deletions, and mutations. conjugal transfer of qnra3 was highly efficient (10(-2)) from k. pneumoniae he96  or k. ascorbata kas96 to escherichia coli j53 but less so (10(-5)) from either donor to a clinical strain of enterobacter cloacae. this first description of a plasmid-borne copy and of the in vitro transfer of qnra3 is taken to illustrate its likely in vivo transfer from s. algae to the enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == dissemination of the ctx-m-25 family beta-lactamases among klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae and identification of the novel enzyme  ctx-m-41 in proteus mirabilis in israel.
AB  == objectives: the ctx-m-25 family of beta-lactamases is a closely related family of enzymes found rarely in the world. we aimed to describe the occurrence and to understand the dissemination of this extended-spectrum beta-lactamase family among enterobacteriaceae strains in our hospital. methods: fifty-four ctx-m-producing enterobacteriaceae strains collected from 2000 to 2005 were screened for bla(ctx-m-25) genes by pcr and sequencing. genetic relatedness was analysed by pfge. antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by vitek-2. plasmids encoding bla(ctx-m-25)-type genes were isolated, transformed and analysed by southern blot using a bla(ctx-m-25) probe. chromosomal location of bla(ctx-m-25)-type was studied by i-ceui restriction analysis. the bla(ctx-m-25)  genetic environment was characterized by pcr mapping and partial sequencing. results: ten out of 54 ctx-m-producing isolates (18.5%) carried bla(ctx-m-25) genes, including klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4), escherichia coli (n = 3), enterobacter cloacae (n = 1) and proteus mirabilis (n = 2). isolates were genetically unrelated. four beta-lactamases were found: ctx-m-25, ctx-m-26, ctx-m-39 and ctx-m-41, a new member of the family (accession no. dq023162) that differed from ctx-m-25 in three amino acids, ala80val, val106ile and ile126ser. bla(ctx-m-25)-type genes were plasmid-mediated in all genera but p. mirabilis, organized in a class i integron and located downstream of an isecp1 element. the  genes were encoded on different plasmids with varying degree of similarities. several antibiotic-resistant determinants conferring resistance to trimethoprim and aminoglycosides existed on the same integron. conclusions: bla(ctx-m-25) exists in israel in different enteric species. spread of these enzymes within and between species is due to transfer of plasmids with common regions and by dissemination of determinants encoding these genes. ctx-m-41, a novel member of this family, was identified in the chromosome of p. mirabilis.

TI  == prevalence and characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae isolated in korean hospitals.
AB  == prevalence and characteristics of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae in korean hospitals were assessed. a total of 1484 clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates were collected from 8 tertiary-care hospitals in various regions of korea over a 3-month period (june to august) in 2005. among 546 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 123 isolates (22.4%) showed esbl-producing activity, and 47 (10.2%) of 460 isolates of escherichia coli were  esbl producers. of the enterobacter cloacae isolates, 16.2% (17/105) evidenced esbl-producing activity. the most prevalent esbls were shv-12 and ctx-m-14 in k.  pneumoniae and e. coli, respectively. in e. cloacae, shv-12 was also the most prevalent. prevalence of esbl production differed among the specimens. although the k. pneumoniae isolates from urine and aspirates evidenced high esbl production rates (35.4% and 57.1%, respectively), those from sputum, blood, and pus showed relatively low esbl production rates (17.0%, 14.8%, and 5.3%, respectively). however, e. coli isolates obtained from sputum showed significantly higher esbl production rates (37.5%) than were seen in samples obtained from other sources, but those obtained from urine showed lower esbl production rates (8.3%). these significant differences in esbl-producing k. pneumoniae and e. coli isolates among the isolated specimens should be examined further, with an eye toward the implications of this research in clinical settings.

TI  == [nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2006].
AB  == the antibacterial activity of meropenem (mepm) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 876 strains of gram-positive bacteria, 1764 strains  of gram-negative bacteria, and 198 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2006 was measured. the results were as follows; 1. mepm was more active than the other carbapenem antibiotics tested against gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and haemophilus influenzae. mepm was also active against most of the species tested in gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. 2. as for pseudomonas aeruginosa, all of the mepm-resistant strains were resistant to imipenem (ipm). mepm showed low cross-resistant rate both againt ipm-resistant p. aeruginosa (41.8%) and ciprofloxacin-resistant p. aeruginosa (33.3%). 3. the proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) strains was 4.3% (6 strains) in escherichia coli, 1.1% (1 strain) in citrobacter freundii, 21.7% (5 strains) in citrobacter koseri, 3.1% (4 strains) in klebsiella pneumoniae, 3.3% (3 strains) in enterobacter cloacae, 0.8% (1 strain) in serratia marcescens, and 4.9% (2 strains) in providencia spp. the proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 3.1% (10 strains) in p. aeruginosa. 4. of all species tested, there were no species, which mic90 of mepm was more than 4-fold higher than those in our previous study. therefore, there is almost no significant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. in conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that mepm retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem at present, 11 years after available for commercial use.

TI  == risk factors for enterobacteriaceae bacteremia after liver transplantation.
AB  == enterobacteriaceae are now the predominant pathogens isolated in bloodstream infections complicating orthotopic liver transplantation (olt). we conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent olt in a university hospital between 01/01/1997 and 31/03/2003 to investigate the risk factors of enterobacteriaceae bacteremia (eb) after olt. eb was defined as the isolation of  an enterobacteriaceae species from at least one blood culture within 3 months following olt. pre-, per- and postoperative variables were collected from the medical records and analyzed in relation to eb. forty (12.5%) of the 320 patients developed eb. the origin of eb was abdominal in 32% of the patients, urinary in 18%, pulmonary in 10%, and primary in the remaining 40% of the patients. two-thirds of eb occurred within 1 month following olt. the main pathogens were escherichia coli (42%), enterobacter cloacae (17%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (17%). susceptibility rates varied from 82.5% for ciprofloxacin to 95% for amikacin. fourteen patients (35%) with eb died. variables significantly associated with eb after multivariate analysis were a meld score >20 (or: 2.79 [1.24-6.30], p=0.013), transplantation for posthepatitic b (or: 4.47 [1.67-11.98], p=0.03) or posthepatitic c (or: 3.79 [1.59-9.01], p=0.03) cirrhosis, a positive bile culture (or: 3.47 [1.19-10.13], p=0.023) and return to surgery (including retransplantation) (or: 2.72 [1.32-5.58], p=0.006). eb is a frequent and severe complication following olt. patients grafted for a posthepatitic cirrhosis, with a severe pretransplantation status, with a positive bile culture and those undergoing reoperation have a high risk of developing eb.

TI  == medical-grade honey kills antibiotic-resistant bacteria in vitro and eradicates skin colonization.
AB  == background: antibiotic resistance among microbes urgently necessitates the development of novel antimicrobial agents. since ancient times, honey has been used successfully for treatment of infected wounds, because of its antibacterial  activity. however, large variations in the in vitro antibacterial activity of various honeys have been reported and hamper its acceptance in modern medicine. methods: we assessed the in vitro bactericidal activity of revamil (bfactory), a  medical-grade honey produced under controlled conditions, and assessed its efficacy for reduction of forearm skin colonization in healthy volunteers in a within-subject-controlled trial. results: with bacillus subtilis as a test strain, we demonstrated that the variation in bactericidal activity of 11 batches of medical-grade honey was <2-fold. antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant isolates of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, and klebsiella oxytoca were killed within 24 h by 10%-40% (vol/vol) honey. after 2 days of application of honey, the extent of forearm skin colonization in healthy  volunteers was reduced 100-fold (p < .001), and the numbers of positive skin cultures were reduced by 76% (p < .001). conclusions: revamil is a promising topical antimicrobial agent for prevention or treatment of infections, including  those caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == magnetic resonance imaging features of spinal epidural empyema in five dogs.
AB  == spinal epidural empyema is defined an accumulation of purulent material in the epidural space of the vertebral canal. spinal epidural empyema should be considered as a differential diagnosis in dogs with pyrexia, spinal pain, and rapidly progressing myelopathy. magnetic resonance (mr) imaging is the imaging test of choice in humans. here, we describe the mr imaging features of five dogs  with confirmed spinal epidural empyema. the epidural lesions appeared as high or  mixed signal masses in t2-weighted (t2w) images. increased signal within the spinal cord gray matter at the site of the lesion was detected in t2w images in all dogs. two patterns of enhancement were detected on postcontrast t1-weighted (t1w) images. mild to moderate peripheral enhancement was seen in three dogs and  a diffuse pattern of enhancement was seen in one. discospondylitis was identified in three dogs on t1w postcontrast images. decompressive spinal surgery was performed in all dogs. bacteria isolated from the abnormal epidural tissue were enterobacter cloacae, coagulase-positive staphylococci, pasteurella multocida, and escherichia coli. in one dog bacteria were not isolated. these mr imaging features, along with appropriate clinical signs, can allow prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment planning.

TI  == bacteria flora and heavy metals in cultivated oysters crassostrea iredalei of setiu wetland, east coast peninsular malaysia.
AB  == slipper oyster crassostrea iredalei is a species of good demand for its sweet flavor and white coloured flesh. the filter feeding nature predisposes oysters to accumulation of pathogenic and heavy metals in waters impacted by sewage pollutions and may thus render the oysters unfit for human consumption. a study was undertaken to investigate the presence of bacteria flora and heavy metal concentrations in cultivated oysters crassostrea iredalei at setiu wetland, terengganu, the only source of cultivated oysters in east coast of malaysia. a total of 200 slipper oyster samples were analyzed. the bacteria were isolated using non selective agar such as tsa agar and selective agars before they were then identified using conventional methods in combination with bbl crystal identification kit. heavy metals such as zinc (zn), copper (cu), cadmium (cd), and lead (pb) concentrations were determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. results showed that the oysters harbor predominantly shewanella putrifaciens followed by vibrio parahaemolyticus, vibrio vulnificus, vibrio cholerae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli and chromobacterium violaceum. they also contain high concentration of zn (785.68 +/- 285.88 microg/g) with the lowest heavy metal was pb (0.17 +/- 0.15 microg/g), whilst the concentrations of other heavy metals were cu (38.9 +/- 13.2 microg/g) and cd (1.60 +/- 0.28 microg/g). the study is very useful to evaluate the type of bacteria and heavy metal present in oyster meat for human consumption.

TI  == chemical markers for the evaluation of raw material hygienic quality in egg products.
AB  == the aim of this research was to study uracil and lactic and acetic acids as chemical markers for hygienic quality evaluation of raw material in liquid pasteurized egg products. uracil, absent in sound whole eggs, was formed in raw and pasteurized egg products as a consequence of high microbial contamination (>10(6) cfu/g) after a sufficient lag time, remaining stable at 4 degrees c but disappearing after 7 days of storage at 25 degrees c. both lactic and acetic acids, starting from initial values of 1-7 mg/kg dry matter, presented trends similar to that of uracil; however, acetic acid never decreased during the storage of raw egg products. with few exceptions, all three metabolites were produced by enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, morganella morganii, serratia liquefaciens, aeromonas hydrophyla, pseudomonas fluorescens, enterococcus avium,  and enterococcus faecalis, separately inoculated in whole egg samples. uracil seems to be the most sensible marker, with a suggested limit corresponding to the detectable level.

TI  == substrate selectivity of the melibiose permease (mely) from enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == we have examined the substrate selectivity of the melibiose permease (mely) from  enterobacter cloacae in comparison with that of the lactose permease (lacy) from  escherichia coli. both proteins catalyze active transport of lactose or melibiose with comparable affinity and capacity. however, mely does not transport the analogue methyl-1-thio-beta,d-galactopyranoside (tmg), which is a very efficient  substrate in lacy. we show that mely binds tmg and conserves cys148 (helix v) as  a tmg binding residue but fails to transport this ligand. based on homology modeling, organization of the putative mely sugar binding site is the same as that in lacy and residues irreplaceable for the symport mechanism are conserved.  moreover, only 15% of the residues where a single-cys mutant is inactivated by site-directed alkylation differ in mely. using site-directed mutagenesis at these positions and engineered cross-homolog chimeras, we show that val367, at the periplasmic end of transmembrane helix xi, contributes in defining the substrate  selectivity profile. replacement of val367 with the mely residue (ala) leads to impairment of tmg uptake. exchanging domains n6 and c6 between lacy and mely also leads to impairment of tmg uptake. tmg uptake activity is restored by the re-introduction of a val367 in the background of chimera n6(lacy)-c6(mely). much  less prominent effects are found with the same mutants and chimeras for the transport of lactose or melibiose.

TI  == distribution of conjugative-plasmid-mediated 16s rrna methylase genes among amikacin-resistant enterobacteriaceae isolates collected in 1995 to 1998 and 2001 to 2006 at a university hospital in south korea and identification of conjugative plasmids mediating dissemination of 16s rrna methylase.
AB  == the distribution of conjugative-plasmid-mediated 16s rrna methylase genes among amikacin-resistant enterobacteriaceae collected between 1995 and 1998 and between 2001 and 2006 at a university hospital in south korea was examined, and conjugative plasmids carrying the 16s rrna methylase genes were characterized by  pcr-based replicon typing and by determination of their antimicrobial resistance  pattern. among the 7,127 isolates, 463 isolates showed a high level of resistance to amikacin, and 218 of the 463 isolates transferred amikacin resistance by conjugation. among the 218 isolates, arma was detected in 153 isolates (88 klebsiella pneumoniae, 28 escherichia coli, 19 enterobacter cloacae, and 6 serratia marcescens isolates and 12 isolates of other organisms), and rmtb was detected in 51 isolates (32 k. pneumoniae isolates, 18 e. coli isolates, and 1 citrobacter freundii isolate). the first appearance of arma was in 1997. the arma gene was carried by conjugative plasmids of replicon groups incl/m, incfiias, incf, inca/c, inchi2, and inc(unidentified) in 38, 20, 7, 9, 4, and 75 strains, respectively. the rmtb gene was carried by conjugative plasmids of groups inca/c, incf, and inci1-igamma in 43 strains, 7 strains, and 1 strain, respectively. transconjugants that received the incl/m plasmid carrying arma or the inca/c plasmid carrying rmtb showed an additional resistance to cefotaxime. transconjugants that received the incfiia plasmid or inc(unidentified) plasmid carrying the arma gene showed an additional resistance to cefoxitin and a high mic(50) (0.25 mg/liter) of ciprofloxacin. in conclusion, this study demonstrated  that the dissemination of 16s rrna methylase genes among the enterobacteriaceae is mediated by conjugative plasmids of various incompatibility groups that confer resistance to multiple drugs, including aminoglycosides, extended-spectrum beta-lactams, and/or quinolones.

TI  == in vitro activity of isepamicin and other aminoglycosides against clinical isolates of gram-negative bacteria causing nosocomial bloodstream infections.
AB  == background and purpose: isepamicin is a newly introduced aminoglycoside in taiwan. since in vitro data for isepamicin against nosocomial gram-negative bloodstream infection from taiwan are limited, we compared the activity of isepamicin, amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin against nosocomial gram-negative  blood isolates. methods: a total of 247 non-duplicate nosocomial blood isolates of gram-negative bacteria collected between january 2003 and december 2003 in a major teaching hospital in taiwan were tested for their in vitro susceptibilities to gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, and isepamicin using the agar dilution method. the isolates included escherichia coli (31 isolates), klebsiella pneumoniae (31), enterobacter cloacae (30), serratia marcescens (31), morganella  morganii (21), citrobacter freundii (10), pseudomonas aeruginosa (31), acinetobacter baumannii (31), and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (31). results: overall, isepamicin had high antibacterial activity against the tested gram-negative bacteria. for the 154 enterobacteriaceae isolates, isepamicin had the lowest minimum concentration inhibiting 90% of isolates (mic90) among the tested drugs, while its resistance rate (3.9%) was equal to that of amikacin (3.9%) and lower than those of tobramycin (18.2%) and gentamicin (21.4%). for the 93 of non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli isolates, isepamicin had the lowest  mic90, and a resistance rate (23.7%) lower than those of amikacin (27.9%), tobramycin (38.7%) and gentamicin (40.9%). conclusions: the in vitro activity of  isepamicin against gram-negative bacteria isolates was equal or similar to amikacin and superior to other tested aminoglycosides. in view of its potential for less nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity than other aminoglycosides, isepamicin is a drug of choice for the empirical treatment of nosocomial infections caused by gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == [characterization of qnr gene for plasmid-mediated quionlone resistance].
AB  == objective: to explore the distribution of qnr gene and broad spectrum p-lactamase (esbls) gene in gram-negative bacteria which were isolated from our hospital patients. methods: qnr gene in nonrepetitive 129 isolates of escherichia coli, 10 isolates of enterobacter cloacac and 29 isolates of k. pneunoniae were detected by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). for qnr gene positive strains, int i, shv-1,  tem-1, ctx-m, oxa-i , oxa-ii , oxa-iii, dha and ebc genes were examined. plasmid  conjugatable test was applied to examine whether qnr gene was located in conjugate plasmid and eric-pcr was carried out for dna homologous analysis. esbls detection (according to phenotypic confirmatory test based on national committee  for clinical laboratory standards criteria) and susceptibility test to 16 antibiotics were also performed. results: qnr gene was found in 6 clinical isolates including 5 strain of e. coli and one strain of e. cloacac, but qnr gene was undetectable in k. pneunoniae isolates. the 6 clinical isolates were suspectible to imipenem but resistance to some other drugs while only 2 isolates  of e. coli were susceptible to quinolone. among the 6 qnr gene-positive strains,  all of them belonged to i type integron-positive isolates, 4 isolates of them were tem-1 producing strains,with only one isolate was oxa-iii gene producing strain, and 2 isolates of them were ebc producing strains. most of them were with 2 esbls gene if not more. qnr gene was on transferable plasmids which could be disseminated by clone. conclusion: in wuhan city, the prevalence of qnr was confirmed. qnr gene were found with some esbls gene in the same strains, and qnr  gene in suspect strains. the transmission of qnr gene producing strains could be  mediated by transferable plasmids or clone, forcing us to make intensive investigation and take effective control measures.

TI  == chemical kinetic and molecular genetic study of selenium oxyanion reduction by enterobacter cloacae sld1a-1.
AB  == microbial processes play an important role in the redox transformations of toxic  selenium oxyanions. in this study, we employed chemical kinetic and molecular genetic techniques to investigate the mechanisms of se(iv) and se-(vi) reduction  by the facultative anaerobe enterobacter cloacae sld1a-1. the rates of microbial  selenium oxyanion reduction were measured as a function of initial selenium oxyanion concentration (0-1.0 mm) and temperature (10-40 degrees c), and mutagenesis studies were performed to identify the genes involved in the selenium oxyanion reduction pathway. the results indicate that se(iv) reduction is significantly more rapid than the reduction of se(vi). the kinetics of the reduction reactions were successfully quantified using the michaelis-menten kinetic equation. both the rates of se(vi) and se(iv) reduction displayed strong  temperature-dependence with e(a) values of 121 and 71.2 kj/ mol, respectively. x-ray absorption near-edge spectra collected for the precipitates formed by se(vi) and se(iv) reduction confirmed the formation of se(0). a minitn5 transposon mutant of e. cloacae sld1a-1 was isolated that had lost the ability to reduce se(vi) but was not affected in se(iv) reduction activity. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed the transposon was inserted within a tatc gene, which  encodes for a central protein in the twin arginine translocation system. complementation by the wild-type tatc sequence restored the ability of mutant strains to reduce se(vi). the results suggest that se(vi) reduction activity is dependent on enzyme export across the cytoplasmic membrane and that reduction of  se(vi) and se(iv) are catalyzed by different enzymatic systems.

TI  == gram-negative bacillary community acquired meningitis is not a rare entity in last two decades.
AB  == the aim of this short note is to assess gram-negative bacillary community acquired meningitis (cbm) and nosocomial meningitis (nm) within 17 years nationwide survey. all cases of gram-negative bacillary cbm within 1990-2007 were assessed in national database of 372 patients with bacterial meningitis: 69 of gram-negative cases were nosocomial and 24 of gram-negative meningitis cases were cbm. those 24 cases were compared with all cbm (201 cases) for risk factors and outcome. among nosocomial gram-negative pathogens, a. baumannii in 23 cases, ps.  aeruginosa in 15 cases and enterobacteriaceae in 31 cases were isolated. among cbm, in 13 cases enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli 6, klebsiella pneumoniae 3, proteus mirabilis 2, enterobacter cloacae 2), in 5 cases ps. aeruginosa and in 6  cases acinetobacter baumannii were isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (csf). the only significant risk factor for cbm due to gram-negative bacilli was neonatal age (12.5% vs. 3.5%, p=0.04) as underlying disease. however, mortality among gram-negative bacillary meningitis was significantly higher (12.4% vs. 37.5%, p=0.001) in comparison to other meningitis.

TI  == saturation mutagenesis of asn152 reveals a substrate selectivity switch in p99 cephalosporinase.
AB  == in class c beta-lactamases, the strictly conserved asn152 forms part of an extended active-site hydrogen-bonding network. to probe its role in catalysis, all 19 mutants of enterobacter cloacae p99 cephalosporinase asn152 were simultaneously constructed and screened in escherichia coli for their in vivo activity. the screen identified the previously uncharacterized mutants asn152ser, asn152thr, and asn152gly, which possess significant activity and altered substrate selectivity. in vitro measurement of michaelis-menten kinetic constants revealed that the asn152ser mutation causes a selectivity switch for penicillin g versus cefoxitin. asn152thr showed a 63-fold increase in k (cat) for oxacillin, a slow substrate for wild-type cephalosporinase. the results contribute to a growing body of data showing that mutation of highly conserved residues in the active site can result in substrate selectivity changes. the library screening method presented here would be applicable to substrate selectivity determination  in other readily screenable enzymes.

TI  == prevalence of qnr genes among extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacterial isolates in barcelona, spain.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the presence of qnr genes among enterobacterial isolates  carrying extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in barcelona, spain. methods:  screening for the qnra, qnrb and qnrs genes was carried out by pcr amplification  with specific primers in 305 non-duplicate, clinically relevant esbl-producing enterobacterial isolates obtained from february 2003 to august 2004. esbls from all qnr-positive isolates were characterized by isoelectric focusing, pcr amplification and dna sequencing. plasmid analysis was performed by s1 digestion  and hybridization with specific probes for the qnr and bla genes. plasmids containing qnr genes were transferred by conjugation or transformation. the genetic environment of qnra1 in selected isolates was characterized by cloning experiments. results: fifteen isolates, each from a different individual, carried qnr. among them, 14 had qnra1 (6 klebsiella pneumoniae, 6 enterobacter cloacae and 2 escherichia coli isolates) and 1 had qnrs1 (k. pneumoniae). none of the isolates carried qnrb. among the qnra1-carrying isolates, 10 possessed both bla(ctx-m-9) and bla(shv-12), 2 had both bla(ctx-m-9) and bla(shv-92) and 2 had bla(ctx-m-9) alone. the isolate with qnrs1 possessed bla(shv-12). the qnra1 and esbl genes were located together on plasmids ranging in size from 40 to 320 kb. qnrs1 and bla(shv-12) were not located on the same plasmid. transfer of quinolone resistance was successfully achieved from all but three isolates. the cloned region surrounding qnra in two k. pneumoniae isolates revealed a novel genetic organization. conclusions: the prevalence of qnr among enterobacterial clinical isolates carrying esbls between 2003 and 2004 in barcelona was 4.9%. qnra1 was the most prevalent, whereas only one qnrs and no qnrb were detected.

TI  == composition of intestinal enterobacteriaceae populations of healthy domestic pigs.
AB  == in this study, the enterobacteriaceae microbiota, including their diversity as well as the distribution of haemolytic and virulence gene-harbouring escherichia  coli of 56-day-old healthy piglets, was characterized. both the composition and the diversity of enterobacteriaceae populations varied considerably between individual pigs and intestinal sections. e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and klebsiella pneumoniae dominated the enterobacteriaceae microbiota. however, mucosa-associated enterobacteriaceae were scarce or in some  cases undetectable. the majority of e. coli clones from the jejunum were also found in the colon, with up to 10 different e. coli clones in one intestinal section. other enterobacteriaceae species were represented by only one clone localized to one intestinal section. while several piglets did not harbour virulence gene-positive or haemolytic e. coli, such strains dominated intestinal  sections of other animals. this study reveals that the diversity of intestinal enterobacteriaceae is clearly individual. in general, enterobacteriaceae do not appear to be a consistent fraction of the microbiota of the jejunum. high numbers of adherent bacteria do not appear to be essential for successful intestinal colonization, and e. coli clones do not necessarily colonize distinct intestinal  sections based on the particular phylogenetic affiliation. furthermore, dominance of haemolytic or virulence gene-positive e. coli does not correlate with disease. finally, probiotic enterococcus faecium feed supplementation does not affect the  enterobacteriaceae microbiota.

TI  == species interactions in mixed-community crystalline biofilms on urinary catheters.
AB  == previous experimental investigations of the crystalline biofilms that colonize and block urinary catheters have focussed on their formation by pure cultures of  proteus mirabilis. in the urine of patients undergoing long-term catheterization, p. mirabilis is commonly found in mixed communities with other urinary tract pathogens. little is known about the effect that the other species have on the rate at which p. mirabilis encrusts catheters. in the present study, a set of data on the nature of the bacterial communities on 106 catheter biofilms has been analysed and it was found that while species such as providencia stuartii and klebsiella pneumoniae were commonly associated with p. mirabilis, when escherichia coli, morganella morganii or enterobacter cloacae were present, p. mirabilis was rarely or never found. the hypothesis that the absence of p. mirabilis from some biofilm communities could be due to its active exclusion by other species has also been examined. experiments in laboratory models showed that co-infection of p. mirabilis with m. morganii, k. pneumoniae or e. coli had  no effect on the ability of p. mirabilis to encrust and block catheters. co-infection with ent. cloacae or pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, significantly  increased the time that catheters took to block (p <0.05). the growth of ent. cloacae, m. morganii, k. pneumoniae or e. coli in the model for 72 h prior to superinfection with p. mirabilis significantly delayed catheter blockage. in the  case of ent. cloacae, for example, the mean time to blockage was extended from 28.7 h to 60.7 h (p < or =0.01). in all cases, however, p. mirabilis was able to  generate alkaline urine, colonize the biofilms, induce crystal formation and block the catheters. the results suggest that although there is a degree of antagonism between p. mirabilis and some of the other urinary tract organisms, the effects are temporary and whatever the pre-existing urinary microbiota, infection with p. mirabilis is thus likely to lead to catheter encrustation and blockage.

AB  == background: we report the emergence and spread of metallo-beta-lactamases (mbls)  among enterobacterial isolates at ramon y cajal university hospital (madrid, spain). methods and results: during the period from march 2005 through september  2006, 25 patients (52% of whom were in the intensive care unit) were infected and/or colonized with single or different mbl-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates (klebsiella pneumoniae, 14 patients; enterobacter cloacae, 12 patients;  escherichia coli, 1 patient; and/or klebsiella oxytoca, 1 patient). clonal analysis (xbai pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) revealed that all k. pneumoniae  isolates belonged to the same clone, but 6 patterns were found among the e. cloacae isolates. carbapenems were affected to different degrees (minimum inhibitory concentration, < or = 1 to > 8 microg/ml), as were aminoglycosides and ciprofloxacin. the bla(vim-1) mbl gene was present in all isolates; in addition,  the bla(shv-12) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene was detected in k. pneumoniae and e. coli isolates. the bla(vim-1) gene was detected within a 4.0-kb class 1 integron (bla(vim-1)-aaca4-dfrii-aada1-catb2) in k. pneumoniae and e. coli and in a 2.5-kb class 1 integron (bla(vim-1)-aaca4-aada1) in e. cloacae and  k. oxytoca isolates. the bla(vim-1) gene was transferable (filter-mating) in 14 of 14 k. pneumoniae isolates, 4 of 11 e. cloacae isolates, and 1 of 1 e. coli isolate. a 60-kb plasmid belonging to the inci1 group was detected in the epidemic vim-1-k. pneumoniae clone. plasmids of 300- or 435-kb belonging to inch12 group were found among e. cloacae isolates. conclusions: k. pneumoniae-mbl monoclonal epidemics coexisted with e. cloacae-mbl multiclonal epidemics in our hospital. the spread of the bla(vim-1) gene among enterobacteriaceae was driven by clonal spread associated with intergeneric plasmid transfer with different class i integron platforms. such complex epidemiology might anticipate endemicity and should be considered for the design of containment epidemiology strategies.

TI  == preoperative sterilization and disinfection of drill guide templates.
AB  == the aim of the in vitro study was to evaluate the decontamination potential of common antiseptic solutions for heat-sensitive implantological drill guide templates. one hundred implantologists were evaluated on the basis of a questionnaire for their measures of disinfection. on the basis of these results,  80% alcohol, octenidine 0.1%, and chlorhexidine 0.12% were tested in an in vitro  model for their decontamination efficacy for heat-sensitive plastic material infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and candida albicans. the microorganisms were selected on the basis of results of environmental testing of dental laboratories. the results of  the questionnaire revealed that chlorhexidine was used by 30%, 80% alcohol by 23%, and octenidine by 7% of the dentists. using the in vitro model, with the exception of s. aureus, chlorhexidine was not able to completely eliminate the microorganisms after 15 min of application. in contrast, the treatment with octenidine revealed no further growth of the tested microorganisms after that time. the 80% alcohol was more efficient. no growth of microorganisms could be detected in any of the tests after 5 min of incubation. on the basis of our results and due to the fact that suitable installations for sterilization were hardly used by the dental practitioners, the disinfection of templates should be  preferentially performed with 80% alcohol or octenidine using an incubation time  of 15 min with ultrasonication.

AB  == studies were conducted to isolate bacteria inhibitory to salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium definitive type (dt) 104 in vitro from cattle not carrying salmonella and to determine the inhibitory activity of the isolated bacteria through competitive growth in cattle feces artificially contaminated with salmonella typhimurium dt104 and s. enterica serovar newport. fecal samples (108) were obtained from dairy and beef cows. s. enterica serovars were isolated from 9.25% of the samples and included salmonella newport (4), salmonella bareilly (1), salmonella mbandaka (1), salmonella montevideo (1), salmonella meleagridis (1), and monophasic salmonella (2). all four salmonella newport isolates were resistant to at least nine antibiotics. of 1,097 bacterial isolates from cattle feces screened, 30 were inhibitory to salmonella typhimurium dt104 in vitro. the  inhibitory isolates included 22 escherichia coli, 6 bacillus circulans, 1 serratia fonticola, and 1 enterobacter cloacae. typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed 17 distinguishable profiles among the 22 e. coli. competitive inhibition isolates did not significantly reduce salmonella typhimurium dt104 during 21 days of storage at 37 degrees c in cattle feces. b. circulans (10(5) cfu/g of inoculum) significantly reduced salmonella newport on days 3 and 5 and on day 21 with 10(8) cfu/g of inoculum at 37 degrees c. at 21degrees c, significant reductions of salmonella typhimurium dt104 occurred with 10(8) cfu of gram-negative competitive inhibition bacteria per g and 10(5) cfu of b. circulans per g on day 5 only. no significant reductions were observed with salmonella newport at 21 degrees c. the 25 competitive inhibition bacteria identified in this study offer a first step in identifying competitive inhibition bacteria that may reduce the level of intestinal carriage and fecal shedding of salmonella typhimurium dt104 and salmonella newport in cattle.

TI  == structure--activity study of the antibacterial peptide fallaxin.
AB  == fallaxin is a 25-mer antibacterial peptide amide, which was recently isolated from the west indian mountain chicken frog leptodactylus fallax. fallaxin has been shown to inhibit the growth of several gram-negative bacteria including enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. here, we report a structure-activity study of fallaxin based on 65 analogs, including a complete alanine scan and a full set of n- and c-terminal truncated analogs. the fallaxin analogs were tested for hemolytic activity and antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-intermediate resistant s. aureus, (visa), methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa), e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. aeruginosa. we identified several analogs, which showed improved antibacterial activity compared to fallaxin. our best candidate was fa12, which displayed mic values of 3.12, 25, 25, and 50 mum against e. coli, k. pneumoniae, mssa, and visa, respectively. furthermore, we correlated the antibacterial activity with various structural parameters such as charge, hydrophobicity h, mean hydrophobic  moment mu(h), and alpha-helicity. we were able to group the active and inactive analogs according to mean hydrophobicity h and mean hydrophobic moment mu(h). far-uv cd-spectroscopy experiments on fallaxin and several analogs in buffer, in  tfe, and in membrane mimetic environments (small unilamellar vesicles) indicated  that a coiled-coil conformation could be an important structural trait for antibacterial activity. this study provides data that support fallaxin analogs as promising lead structures in the development of new antibacterial agents.

TI  == prevalence and expression of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinant qnra1.
AB  == since its discovery, qnra has been found in most common enterobacteriaceae. ciprofloxacin mics conferred by different qnra-positive plasmids could range from 0.1 microg/ml to 2 microg/ml in escherichia coli j53. the reasons for different ciprofloxacin mics conferred by qnra have not been fully clarified. five hundred  forty-one consecutive gram-negative clinical strains that were resistant or intermediate to ciprofloxacin and that were isolated in shanghai in 2005 were screened for qnra by pcr. for qnra-positive isolates, the transferability of quinolone resistance was determined by conjugation and mutations within the quinolone resistance-determining region (qrdr) of gyra and parc. aac(6')-ib-cr was detected and qnra rna expression was determined using real-time reverse transcription-pcr for transconjugants with different ciprofloxacin mics. the qnra gene was detected in 7 of the 541 clinical isolates. quinolone resistance was transferred in four strains by conjugation. mutations in the qrdr of gyra and parc were detected in five qnra-positive clinical strains with higher ciprofloxacin mics. of four qnra-bearing plasmids in e. coli j53, phs4 and phs5 conferred ciprofloxacin mics of 0.094 to 0.125 microg/ml; phs3, which harbored the aac(6')-ib-cr gene as well, conferred a ciprofloxacin mic of 0.25 microg/ml,  and phs6, which had both the aac(6')-ib-cr gene and a high expression level of qnra, had a ciprofloxacin mic of 1.0 microg/ml. the prevalence of qnra appeared to be higher in enterobacter cloacae than in other enterobacteriaceae. the coexistence of qnra and aac(6')-ib-cr in a single plasmid and increased qnra expression can account for the different levels of ciprofloxacin resistance seen  in transconjugants.

TI  == diversity of microflora in the gut and casts of tropical composting earthworms reared on different substrates.
AB  == the diversity of fungi, bacteria, yeast, actinomycetes and protozoa were analysed in the gut and casts of eudrilus eugeniae, lampito mauritii, eisenia fetida and perionyx excavatus, both qualitatively and quantitatively as influenced by different feed substrates like clay loam soil, cowdung and pressmud. while actinomycetes (streptomyces albus, s. somaliensis, nocardia asteroides, n. caviae and saccharomonosporia) were not digested by any of these species of worms, protozoa (amoeba proteus, a. terricola, paramecium trichium, euglena viridis, e.  orientalis, vorticella picta and trichomonas hominis) and yeast (candida tropicalis, c. krusei c. albicans and cryptococcus neoformans) were totally digested. certain species of fungi (saksenae vasiformis, mucor plumbeus, cladosporium carrionii, c. herbacium, alternaria sp., cunninghamella echinulata,  mycetia sterila, syncephalostrum racemosum, curvalaria lunata, c. geniculata and  geotrichum candidum) and bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacterium antitratum,  mima polymorpha, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, proteus vulgaris, p. mirabilis, p. rettgeri, escherichia coli, staphylococus citreus, bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, enterococci and micrococci) were completely digested. certain other species were not digested fungi like aspergillus fumigatus, a. flavus, a. ochraceous, trichoderma koningii (except by eeugeniae), fusarium moniliforme (except by e. eugeniae) and rhizopus sp., and bacteria like klebsiella pneumoniae and morganella morganii) and these were multiplied during the transit of the organic residues through the gut of worms. the microbial proliferation was more in the casts, due to the environment prevailing--rich in nutrient supply and large surface area available for growth and reproduction of the microbes that lead to enhanced microbial activity and humic acid contents in  the casts.

TI  == postcollection synthesis of ethyl glucuronide by bacteria in urine may cause false identification of alcohol consumption.
AB  == background: ethyl glucuronide (etg) is a minor ethanol metabolite used as a specific marker to document recent alcohol consumption; confirm abstinence in treatment programs, workplaces, and schools; and provide legal proof of drinking. this study examined if bacterial pathogens in urine may enable postsampling synthesis of etg and ethyl sulfate (ets) from ethanol, leading to clinical false-positive results. methods: urine specimens with confirmed growth of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, or enterobacter cloacae were stored at room temperature in the presence of ethanol. ethanol was either added to the samples or generated by inoculation with the fermenting yeast species candida albicans and glucose as substrate. etg and ets were measured by lc-ms. results: high concentrations of etg (24-h range 0.5-17.6 mg/l) were produced during storage in 35% of e. coli-infected urines containing ethanol. in some specimens that were initially etg positive because of recent alcohol consumption, etg was also sensitive to degradation by bacterial hydrolysis. in contrast, ets was completely stable under these conditions. conclusions: the presence of etg in urine is not a unique indicator of recent drinking, but might originate from postcollection synthesis if specimens are infected with e. coli and contain ethanol. given the associated risks for false identification of alcohol consumption and false-negative etg results due to bacterial degradation, we recommend that measurement of etg be combined with ets, or in the future possibly replaced by ets.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative bacilli causing infections in intensive care unit patients in the united states between 1993 and 2004.
AB  == during the 12-year period from 1993 to 2004, antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of 74,394 gram-negative bacillus isolates recovered from intensive care  unit (icu) patients in united states hospitals were determined by participating hospitals and collected in a central location. mics for 12 different agents were  determined using a standardized broth microdilution method. the 11 organisms most frequently isolated were pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.2%), escherichia coli (18.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (14.2%), enterobacter cloacae (9.1%), acinetobacter spp. (6.2%), serratia marcescens (5.5%), enterobacter aerogenes (4.4%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.3%), proteus mirabilis (4.0%), klebsiella oxytoca (2.7%), and citrobacter freundii (2.0%). specimen sources included the lower respiratory tract (52.1%), urine (17.3%), and blood (14.2%). rates of resistance to many of the antibiotics tested remained stable during the 12-year study period. carbapenems were the most active drugs tested against most of the bacterial species. e. coli and p. mirabilis remained susceptible to most of the drugs tested. mean rates of resistance to 9 of the 12 drugs tested increased with acinetobacter spp. rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin increased over the study  period for most species. ceftazidime was the only agent to which a number of species (acinetobacter spp., c. freundii, e. aerogenes, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, and s. marcescens) became more susceptible. the prevalence of multidrug resistance, defined as resistance to at least one extended-spectrum cephalosporin, one aminoglycoside, and ciprofloxacin, increased substantially among icu isolates of acinetobacter spp., p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae.

TI  == development of a base stacking hybridization-based microarray method for rapid identification of clinical isolates.
AB  == a base stacking hybridization-based microarray method was developed for rapid identification of clinical isolates within 2 h. the oligonucleotide probe sequences for species or genus-level identification were targeted against ribosomal rna. isolates were lysed and directly hybridized to the microarray-bound capture probes without conventional dna or rna isolation and prior polymerase chain reaction amplification. five bacterial species encountered frequently in the clinical setting, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae, and one genus enterococcus, could be discriminated by the microarray-based assay. identification by this method matched biochemical identification for 150 of 152 clinical strains. this base-stacking hybridization microarray offers a simple, fast (</=2 h), and accurate identification of bacterial cultures and is a potential tool for routine clinical diagnosis.

TI  == efficacy of a novel biofilter in hatchery sanitation: i. removal of airborne bacteria, dust and endotoxin.
AB  == a novel biofilter containing organic, bentonite and halloysite media was applied  for elimination of microbial pollutants from the air of an industrial hatchery. the concentrations of total mesophilic bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, thermophilic actinomycetes, dust and bacterial endotoxin were determined in the air of hatchery during 2 months before installation of the biofilter, and during  6 months after installation of the biofilter, at the inlet and outlet ducts from  each medium. before installation of the biofilter, the concentrations of total mesophilic bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, thermophilic actinomycetes, dust and endotoxin in the air were within the ranges of 0.97-131.2x10(3) cfu/m3, 0.0-34.4x10(3) cfu/m3, 0.0-0.02x10(3) cfu/m3, 0.37-4.53 mg/m3, and 50.9-520,450.4 ng/m3, respectively. enterococcus faecalis and gram-negative bacteria (acinetobacter spp., escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, and other species) prevailed among bacterial species recovered from the air of the hatchery. a total of 56 species or genera of bacteria were identified in the air samples taken in the examined hatchery; of these, 11, 11 and 6 species or genera respectively were reported as having allergenic, immunotoxic and/or infectious properties the concentrations of total mesophilic bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, enterococcus faecalis and endotoxin found at the inlet duct of the biofilter after its installation were significantly smaller compared to those recorded before its installation (p<0.05). the concentrations of gram-negative bacteria, enterococcus faecalis and dust found at the outlet ducts of biofilter after its installation were significantly smaller compared to those recorded at the inlet duct of the biofilter (p<0.01). the concentrations of total meso-philic bacteria were also smaller at the outlet ducts of the biofilter compared to that at the inlet duct;  however, the difference was not significant because of the massive growth of streptomyces species in the biofilter's media which contaminated the outcoming air. in conclusion, the applied biofilter proved to be effective in the elimination of potentially pathogenic bacteria, dust and endotoxin from the air of the hatchery. the efficacy of the biofilter could be improved by the inhibition of the streptomyces growth in the media of the biofilter.

TI  == expression of ampc beta-lactamase in enterobacter cloacae isolated from retail ground beef, cattle farm and processing facilities.
AB  == aims: to better understand antibiotic resistance of enterobacter cloacae isolates originated from food animals, the phenotypic and genotypic resistance of ent. cloacae isolates from retail ground beef, cattle farm, processing facilities and  clinical settings were investigated. methods and results: the ampc, ampd and ampr genes in the isolates were sequenced and analysed. beta-lactamase activities and  beta-lactamase profiles of the isolates were analysed by the enzymatic hydrolysis of nitrocefin and isoelectric focussing, respectively. the ampc gene of the ent.  cloacae isolate was cloned and transformed into escherichia coli strains. the genomic dna profiles of ent. cloacae isolates were analysed by using pulse field  gel electrophoresis (pfge). mutation at one residue (val-54-->ile) in the ampr amino acid sequence was consistently found in ent. cloacae isolates that were resistant to a broadspectrum of beta-lactam agents. the enzyme activity in the isolates was induced by cefoxitin. the pi (isoelectric point) of the enzymes produced by the test strains ranged from 8.4 to 8.9. cloning of ampc gene of the  ent. cloacae isolate conferred the resistance to ampicillin, cephalothin and amoxicillin in recipient e. coli strains. one recipient of e. coli o157:h7 strain additionally acquired resistance to ceftiofur. the genomic analysis of ent. cloacae isolates by pfge showed that the isolates from various sources were genetically unrelated. conclusions: the spread of diverse clones of ampc-producing ent. cloacae occurred in the ecosystem and retail products. significance and impact of the study: our findings suggested that ampc-producing  ent. cloacae could be a contributor in spreading beta-lactamase genes in farm environments and food processing environments.

TI  == convenient test using a combination of chelating agents for detection of metallo-beta-lactamases in the clinical laboratory.
AB  == although transmissible metallo-beta-lactamases (mbls) are a serious threat to beta-lactam antibiotic therapy, the clsi currently does not recommend testing methods for the detection of mbls. the aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of double-disk tests (ddts) by using disks containing a combination of the chelators 2-mercaptopropionic acid (mpa) and tris-edta (te) to detect mbls. sixteen isolates (4 acinetobacter baumannii isolates, 6 pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, 1 serratia marcescens isolate, 1 aeromonas hydrophila isolate, 1 aeromonas veronii isolate, 2 chryseobacterium meningosepticum isolates, and 1 stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolate) producing imp-1, imp-1-like, imp-18, gim-1, spm-1, vim-2, vim-2-like, and chromosomal mbls and 20 isolates (7 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 3 escherichia coli isolates, 5 enterobacter cloacae isolates, 2 s. marcescens isolates, 1 proteus mirabilis isolate, and 2 a. baumannii isolates) producing non-mbl carbapenemases, ampc beta-lactamases, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were tested. the ddt method was evaluated by using four types of chelator disks (te, high-strength te, mpa, and te plus 20 microl of mpa [at various concentrations]) and the beta-lactams imipenem (ipm), meropenem (mem), ertapenem (ert), and ceftazidime (caz). ddts with ipm and a te disk supplemented with 1:320 mpa detected all mbls and yielded no false-positive  results. some, but not all, mbl producers were detected in ipm-based tests involving the single chelator te or mpa alone or by ert- or caz-based tests. ipm-based tests with mpa concentrations other than 1:320 and all mem-based tests  had suboptimal sensitivities or specificities. ddt with ipm and a te disk supplemented with 20 microl of 1:320 mpa appears to be convenient for the detection of mbls in the clinical laboratory.

TI  == pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiling of cefepime in plasma and peritoneal fluid of abdominal surgery patients.
AB  == this study was conducted to characterise the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cefepime in plasma and peritoneal fluid (pf). one gram of cefepime was administered to eight laparotomy patients and plasma and pf samples  were collected at the end of 0.5 h infusion and every hour for 6 h. drug concentrations were determined, analysed by population pharmacokinetic modelling  and used for a monte carlo simulation with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) data. the maximum concentration in pf was two-thirds of the value in plasma; however, the concentrations were higher in pf than in plasma at 0.68 h post dose. the probabilities of attaining the pharmacodynamic target (65% of the time above  the mic) were 92-99% in plasma (90% fraction unbound) and 93-100% in pf against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae with a regimen of 1 g every 12 h. however, 1 g every 8 h or 2 g every 12 h was required for values of 94-95% in plasma and 95-96% in pf against pseudomonas aeruginosa. these results demonstrate that the pharmacodynamic exposures in pf were almost identical to those estimated from plasma data and provided a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic rationale for the dosing regimen for surgical intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == nosocomial outbreak due to extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase- producing enterobacter cloacae in a cardiothoracic intensive care unit.
AB  == enterobacter cloacae has been associated with several outbreaks, usually involving strains that overproduce chromosomal beta-lactamase or, uncommonly, strains expressing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl). only sporadic cases  of esbl-producing e. cloacae have been identified in our hospital in recent years. we describe the epidemiology and clinical and microbiological characteristics of an outbreak caused by esbl-producing e. cloacae in a cardiothoracic intensive care unit (ct-icu). prospective surveillance of patients with infection or colonization by esbl-producing e. cloacae among patients admitted to the ct-icu was performed during the outbreak. production of esbl was  determined by decreased susceptibility to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and a  positive double-disk test result. clone relatedness was determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). from july to september 2005, seven patients in the ct-icu with esbl-producing e. cloacae were identified (four males; median age, 73 years; range, 45 to 76 years); six patients had cardiac surgery. four patients developed infections; three had primary bacteremia, one had ventilator-associated pneumonia, and one had tracheobronchitis. esbl-producing e. cloacae showed resistance to quinolones and aminoglycosides. pfge revealed two patterns. five isolates belonged to clone a; two carried a single esbl (pi 8.2 and a positive pcr result for the shv type), and three carried two esbls (pis 8.1 and 8.2 and positive pcr results for the shv and ctx-m-9 types). isolates belonging to clone b carried a single esbl (pi 5.4 and a positive pcr result for the tem type). review of antibiotic consumption showed increased use of cefepime and quinolones during june and july 2005. the outbreak  was stopped by the implementation of barrier measures and cephalosporin restriction. esbl production could be increasingly common in nosocomial pathogens other than escherichia coli or klebsiella pneumoniae.

TI  == [drug-resistant bacteria isolated from pharyngeal swab cultures and urine in acutely or chronically febrile elderly nursing home inmates].
AB  == aim: patients in nursing homes are becoming more and more elderly and also prone  to infectious diseases. it is important to select proper antimicrobial agents in  treating such patients because of the increase in drug-resistant bacteria in recent years. methods: pathogenic aerobic bacteria were isolated from cultures of the pharyngeal swab obtained from patients with acute febrile episodes and those  with chronic febrile conditions with a repetition of fever or continuing low-grade fever. isolation of pathogens was also carried out in patients with a urinary tract infection that was resistant to treatment. isolated bacteria were tested for sensitivity to commonly used antimicrobial agents. results: pathogenic bacteria were isolated from 33% of the patients with acute febrile episodes, while they were isolated from 75% of the patients with chronic febrile conditions. the number of major pathogenic bacteria from 85 isolates were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) 13, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa) 6, streptococcus pneumoniae 8, beta-hemolytic streptococcus 5, klebsiella pneumoniae 10, and enterobacter cloacae 6. only two isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae were penicillin-sensitive (pssp), while the  others were penicillin-resistant (prsp) (1) or penicillin-insensitive (pisp) (5). among these 8 isolates, 5 were resistant to levofloxacin (lvfx). escherichia coli was isolated from the pharyngeal swab of 2 patients, one of the 2 isolates being  resistant to lvfx. escherichia coli was isolated from 5 patients with urinary tract infection and 5 of the 6 isolates were resistant to lvfx; with one of them  being extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl). conclusion: the frequency of isolation of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens was extremely high among elderly patients in our nursing home compared to values reported from a nation-wide survey recently carried out in japan. in particular, attention should be focused  on the resistance of bacteria to fluoroquinolones.

TI  == [bile duct infections as a late complication after endoscopic sphincterotomy].
AB  == nowadays endoscopic sphincterotomy (se) is considered to be a "gold standard" in  the treatment of residual choledocholithiasis and biliary pancreatitis. nevertheless patients after invasive procedures concerning bile ducts with destruction of oddi's sphincter often have increased succeptibility to chronic infections of bile ducts. aim: assessment of the influence of se on bacterial colonization, development of main bile duct chronic inflammation and recurrent choledocholithiasis. material and methods: we included to the study 50 patients with main bile duct lithiasis, who underwent endoscopic cholangiopancreatography  (ercp). among them there were 32 women in age from 45 to 87 (mean 69.7 +/- 12.3)  and 18 men in age from 39 to 84 (mean 59.8 +/- 11.56). the studied group was divided into 3 subgroups: in i (control) group were included 10 patients diagnosed with ercp techniques because of jaundice of unknown origin. those patients did't have ercp or operative revision of bile ducts before, but all of them underwent cholecystectomy in the past. each ii and iii group consisted of 20 patients, who underwent se before 12-24 and 25-36 months earlier respectively. sterile uodenoscope was inserted to the region of major duodenal papilla, and then a sterile brush was used to collect material to cytological smear (brushing) from main bile duct. in all groups 2 ml of bile were taken by a catheter to a syringe. on the basis of radiograms from ercp findings, the width of main bile duct was assessed. in all patients blood cell count, aspartate and alanine aminotransferases, gammaglutamyltranspeptidase, alkaline phosphatase, amylase, bilirubin, c-reactive protein and procalcitonine levels were measured. results: in our study all 40 patients with previously performed endoscopic sphincterotomy  (se) had bacterial colonization in bile ducts, mostly with gramm negative pathogens. the most virulent pathogens vere cultured from bile duct swabs from patients after two or more revisions of common bile duct, and after a longer time from sphincterotomy. those patients had multibacterial bile duct infections (escherichia coli + pseudomonas aeruginosa; p. aeruginosa + enterococcus faecalis; e. faecalis + enterobacter cloacae + candida albicans; p. aeruginosa +  e. cloacae). e. coil and e. faecalis were most frequently cultured (20 and 16 cases respectively). it was observed that with length of time from endoscopic sphincterotomy, the width of main bile duct and also amount of cultured pathogens and their virulency grow. elevated transaminases activity and serum procalcitonine levels were observed in studied groups. 9 patients after previous  sphincterotomy had recurrent lithiasis. conclusions: sphincterotomy contributes to colonization of main bile duct with pathogenic bacteria. with length of time from endoscopic sphincterotomy, and amount of performed endoscopic sphincterotomies the amount of cultured pathogens, their virulency and drug resistance grow. chronic infection of bile ducts after endoscopic sphincterotomy  causes higher risk of recurrent lithiasis.

AB  == a total of 52 patients of enterobacter cloacae bacteremia from a university hospital during the period from january 2000 to june 2005 were analysed and compared with a reference group comprising 52 patients of escherichia coli bacteremia. overall, e. cloacae ranked the tenth in all pathogens of bacteremia accounting for 2.8% of the total patients. although the incidence of e. cloacae bacteremia was low, the attributable mortality rate till achieved 13.5%. most patients (86.5%) with e. cloacae bacteremia were hospital-acquired. the overwhelming majority of patients (92.3%) were men, while almost half of the patients (48.1%) were from the department of urological surgery with underlying diseases such as urinal obstruction, kidney transplantation and kidney tumours. possible risks factors associated with e. cloacae bacteremia included immunocompromised status, long-term hospitalisation and invasive procedures or surgeries. e. cloacae bacteremia significantly differed from e. coli bacteremia in a number of clinical aspects, including underlying diseases, portal of entry,  infection type, risks factors, laboratory findings and appropriateness of empirical antibiotic therapy. besides the high prevalence of resistance to cephalosporins, most e. cloacae blood isolates were also resistant to ciprofloxacin (resistance rate, 67.3%), gentamicin (73.1%) and tobramycin (73.1%). based on the findings of the present study, e. cloacae is probably an important pathogen of bacteremia occurring in male patients with underlying urinal system illnesses.

TI  == emergence of rmtb methylase-producing escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae isolates from pigs in china.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the occurrence of 16s rrna methylases conferring high-level resistance to aminoglycosides in enterobacteriaceae isolated from two  pig farms in china. methods: enterobacteriaceae isolated from 151 pig rectal swab samples and 9 environmental samples were screened for the presence of the rmta, rmtb, arma and rmtc genes by pcr and sequencing. conjugation experiments were carried out to study the transferability of the 16s rrna methylase genes. all isolates and their transconjugants were tested for susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. the clonal relatedness of rmtb-producing escherichia coli was assessed by pfge with xbai. results: of 152 enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from pigs, 49 (32%) were positive for the rmtb gene, including 48 e. coli and a single isolate of enterobacter cloacae. of the nine enterobacteriaceae isolates from environmental samples, no 16s rrna methylase gene was identified. the 49 rmtb-positive isolates showed resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline and trimethoprim and also carried a bla(tem) gene. transfer of the rmtb and bla(tem)  genes by conjugation experiments of all 49 isolates was successful, suggesting that the rmtb-containing plasmids in the e. coli and e. cloacae isolates were self-transmissible. conjugative transfer frequencies varied from 2.2 x 10(-10) to 1.3 x 10(-6) transconjugants per recipient. the transfer of non-aminoglycoside antimicrobial resistance traits was also observed in most cases. forty-four rmtb-positive e. coli showed 30 different pfge types. conclusions: the rmtb gene  was detected on conjugative plasmids of porcine e. coli and e. cloacae isolates.  both horizontal gene transfer and clonal spread were responsible for the dissemination of the rmtb gene. the emergence of 16s rrna methylases in enterobacteriaceae isolates is described for the first time in china. this is also the first report of rmtb-positive enterobacteriaceae among healthy food-producing animals.

TI  == detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae by use of semiautomated microbiology systems and manual detection procedures.
AB  == three commercially available microbiology identification and susceptibility testing systems were compared with regard to their ability to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production in enterobacteriaceae, i.e., the phoenix automated microbiology system (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md), the vitek 2 system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france), and the microscan walkaway-96 system (dade behring, inc., west sacramento, ca), using routine testing panels. one hundred fifty putative esbl producers were distributed blindly to three participating laboratories. conventional phenotypic confirmatory tests such as the disk approximation method, the clsi double-disk synergy test, and the etest esbl were also evaluated. biochemical and molecular characterization of beta-lactamases performed at an independent laboratory was used as the reference method. one hundred forty-seven isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii were investigated. of these  isolates, 85 were identified as esbl producers by the reference method. the remaining isolates were identified as non-esbl producers; they were either hyperproducers of their chromosomal ampc, koxy, or shv enzymes or lacked any detectable beta-lactamase activity. the system with the highest sensitivity for the detection of esbls was the phoenix (99%), followed by the vitek 2 (86%) and the microscan (84%); however, specificity was more variable, ranging from 52% (phoenix) to 78% (vitek 2). the performance of the semiautomated systems differed widely with the species investigated. the sensitivities of the conventional test  methods ranged from 93 to 94%. the double-disk synergy test showed the highest specificity and positive predictive value among all test methods, i.e., 97% and 98%, respectively.

TI  == bacterial isolates from severe infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in italy: a nationwide study in the hospital setting.
AB  == the most frequent agents of severe bacterial infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns were determined in patients admitted to 45 italian hospitals over the years 2002-2003. the most common diagnoses were: sepsis (33.8%), pneumonia (9.4%), intravascular catheter-associated infections (9.3%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (8.1%). overall, 5115 bacterial isolates were identified from 4228 patients. three bacterial species, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli, accounted for more than 50% of the isolates. other prevalent bacterial isolates were staphylococcus epidermidis and  enterococcus faecalis, while acinetobacter baumanii ranked third among all intensive care unit (icu) isolates. 7% of s. aureus had intermediate resistance to vancomycin. although e. faecalis displayed no vancomycin resistance, 34% of vancomycin-resistant isolates were found among enterococcus faecium, one of the highest rates found to date, emphasizing the difference between these two enterococcal species. all the gram-positive pathogens were susceptible to linezolid, with the exception of approximately 2% of the enterococcal isolates that were intermediate with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)=4 microg/ml. almost 10% of escherichia coli, 14% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 22% of serratia marcescens and 50% of enterobacter cloacae were non-susceptible to cefotaxime. amikacin was the most active antibiotic against p. aeruginosa that showed lack of susceptibility to ceftazidime, gentamicin, piperacillin and ciprofloxacin ranging from 20 to 35%. finally, acinetobacter baumanii showed a high level of resistance to all the antibiotics tested including imipenem (58%). the results obtained in this study, the first of its kind in italy, offer indications for guiding empirical therapy and implementing specific interventions to fight antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and their transmission in the hospital  setting in italy.

TI  == se(vi) reduction and the precipitation of se(0) by the facultative bacterium enterobacter cloacae sld1a-1 are regulated by fnr.
AB  == the fate of selenium in the environment is controlled, in part, by microbial selenium oxyanion reduction and se(0) precipitation. in this study, we identified a genetic regulator that controls selenate reductase activity in the se-reducing  bacterium enterobacter cloacae sld1a-1. heterologous expression of the global anaerobic regulatory gene fnr (fumarate nitrate reduction regulator) from e. cloacae in the non-se-reducing strain escherichia coli s17-1 activated the ability to reduce se(vi) and precipitate insoluble se(0) particles. se(vi) reduction by e. coli s17-1 containing the fnr gene occurred at rates similar to those for e. cloacae, with first-order reaction constants of k = 2.07 x 10(-2) h(-1) and k = 3.36 x 10(-2) h(-1), respectively, and produced elemental selenium  particles with identical morphologies and short-range atomic orders. mutation of  the fnr gene in e. cloacae sld1a-1 resulted in derivative strains that were deficient in selenate reductase activity and unable to precipitate elemental selenium. complementation by the wild-type fnr sequence restored the ability of mutant strains to reduce se(vi). our findings suggest that se(vi) reduction and the precipitation of se(0) by facultative anaerobes are regulated by oxygen-sensing transcription factors and occur under suboxic conditions.

TI  == emergence of arma and rmtb aminoglycoside resistance 16s rrna methylases in belgium.
AB  == objectives: 16s rrna methylase-mediated high-level resistance to aminoglycosides  has been reported recently in clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli only from a limited number of countries. this study was conducted to investigate the occurrence of this type of resistance in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae  from two belgian hospitals and the characteristics of the strains. methods: we screened for high-level gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin resistance in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae consecutively collected between 2000 and  2005 at two laboratories by pcr for the arma, rmta and rmtb 16s rrna methylase genes. the beta-lactamase presence in the strains was also determined by phenotypic and genotypic methods. results: overall arma genes were detected in 18 klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter amalonaticus whereas rmtb was detected in a single e. coli isolate. the rmta gene was not found. all 16s rrna methylase-bearing strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), predominantly type ctx-m-3, as well as various types of beta-lactamases. in the majority of the strains, the  arma gene was carried by conjugative plasmids of the incl/m incompatibility group whereas rmtb was borne by an incfi plasmid. conclusions: this is the first report of the emergence of 16s rrna methylases in enterobacteriaceae in belgium. the rapid spread of multidrug-resistant isolates producing both esbls and 16s rrna methylases raises clinical concern and may become a major therapeutic threat in the future.

TI  == are laboratory-based antibiograms reliable to guide the selection of empirical antimicrobial treatment in patients with hospital-acquired infections?
AB  == objectives: antibiograms are often taken into account to define a rational selection of an empirical antimicrobial therapy for treating patients with hospital-acquired infections. in this study, we performed a paired comparison between the antibiogram constructed with laboratory-based data and that formed with data subjected to prior clinical validation. methods: between 2003 and 2005, the laboratory of microbiology printed in duplicate every individual susceptibility report corresponding to hospitalized patients and the copy was sent to the department of infection control. every individual report was assessed in real time at the bedside of the patient by a multidisciplinary team for clinical significance and appropriateness of the specimen, as well as for the type, source and origin of the infection. cumulative resistance rates were estimated in parallel at the laboratory with the whole data, and at the infection control department with data subjected to prior clinical validation. these rates  were designated as 'laboratory-based' and 'clinically based', respectively. results: a total of 2305 individual susceptibility reports were assessed. only 1429 (62.0%) were considered as clinically significant by the multidisciplinary team. escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii group, klebsiella species and proteus mirabilis resistant to broad-spectrum cephalosporins, as well as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, were significantly more frequent in the clinically based rates (p < or = 0.03). conclusions: laboratory-based data underestimate the frequency of several major resistant organisms in patients with hospital-acquired infection. previous clinical validation of the individual susceptibility reports seems to be a suitable strategy to get more reliable data.

TI  == [development of beta-lactamase resistance in enterobacteria].
AB  == enterobacteria produce elementary chromosomal enzymes, beta-lactamases of class a: tem and shv (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae). these can give rise to  plasmid-coded broad-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) discovered in 1980 (e. coli,  k. pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae). the first cefotaximase (ctx-m, men-1) was reported in europe in 1990. this enzyme is far more active against cefotaxime than against ceftazidime and aztreonam. chromosomal hyperpoduction of k1 beta-lactamase differs from all other esbls due its sensitivity to ceftazidime (klebsiella oxytoca). however, not all enterobacteria are resistant only because  of esbls, but also as a result of the action of chromosomally or plasmid coded ampc beta-lactamase of class c (mir-1, cmy-1, bil-1, fox-1, mox-1, dha-1, acc-1), resistant to beta-lactamase inhibitors and to cefoxitin (enterobacter spp., proteus vulgaris, citrobacter freundii, morganelle spp., serratia spp.). with the loss of outside-membrane porins (omp) they can become resistant to carbapenem an  tibiotics. the 100% resistance of enterobacteria to carbapenems that so far exists in this country is elsewhere in the world compromised by the incidence of  carbapenem-hydrolysing plasmid-determined beta-lactamase of class b (imp-1, vim-1) and of class a (kpc-1) in k. pneumoniae, (sme-1) in serratia marcescens and (imi-1, nmc-a) in e. clocae. carbapenemases in enterobacteria are only effective in the presence of impermeability and other resistance mechanisms.

TI  == bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  == treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. it is active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. the aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella ozaenae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers  and non-producers). gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic bacteroides fragilis. ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs). killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the  first few hours of the kinetic curves against e. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (cfu) reduction in the first 2h), b. fragilis (4 log(10) cfu reduction in 4h), mssa (3 log(10) cfu reduction in 4-6h), k. ozaenae (esbl+), k. pneumoniae (esbl+ and -), e. cloacae (esbl-) in 1h and p. mirabilis (esbl+) in the first 2h. the potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of e. coli-b. fragilis and e. coli-b. fragilis-e. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of s. aureus-p. mirabilis. these results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

AB  == antibacterial agents disrupt the ecological balance of the normal human microflora. tigecycline, a member of a new class of antibiotics (glycylcyclines), has been shown to have a potent broad-spectrum activity against most gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the aim of the study was to investigate the ecological effects of tigecycline on the normal oropharyngeal and intestinal microflora of healthy subjects. thirteen healthy white subjects (six females and seven males) between 20 and 31 years of age received 100 mg of tigecycline in the morning on day 1 as a 30-min intravenous infusion followed by a 50-mg dose of tigecycline every 12 h as a 30-minute infusion for 10 days. one subject was withdrawn on day 2 because of an adverse event (urticaria). serum, saliva, and fecal samples were collected before, during, and after administration for microbiological cultivation and for assays of tigecycline. all new colonizing bacteria were tested for susceptibility (resistance of > or =8 mg/liter) during the investigation period. the fecal concentrations on day 8 were from 3.0 to 14.1 mg/kg, with a mean value of 6.0 mg/kg and a median value of 5.6 mg/kg. the saliva concentrations were generally low (0 to 0.12 mg/liter). a minor effect on the oropharyngeal microflora was observed. the numbers of enterococci and escherichia coli cells in the intestinal microflora were reduced at day 8 (p < 0.05), while those of other enterobacteria  and yeasts increased. there was a marked reduction of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria (p < 0.05) but no impact on bacteroides. no clostridium difficile  strains were isolated. two klebsiella pneumoniae strains and five enterobacter cloacae strains resistant to tigecycline were found on day 8.

TI  == dissemination of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in intensive care units of a medical center in taiwan.
AB  == the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae in a tertiary hospital in taiwan was assessed over a 16-month  period. a total of 125 nonrepetitive esbl-producing isolates of enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae were available for investigation using molecular methods. four predominant intensive care units (icus) were identified, and shv-12 (59%), ctx-m- 3 (36%), and ctx-m-14 (14%) were the three most frequent esbls. shv-12 was predominant among e. cloacae in the burn unit and k. pneumoniae in the other three chest medicine-related icus. ctx-m-3 was predominant among e. coli and k. pneumoniae in three other icus. the  dissemination of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae in four icus of a medical center in taiwan is a consequence of the clonal dissemination of a few epidemic strains along with the horizontal transmission of resistance genes-carrying plasmids among bacterial organisms.

TI  == potential prophylactic value of bovine colostrum in necrotizing enterocolitis in  neonates: an in vitro study on bacterial attachment, antibody levels and cytokine production.
AB  == necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) is an important disease of low birth-weight neonates. the immaturity of the gut mucosa may result in close contact between the host epithelium and microorganisms which are normally confined to the gut lumen. damage of the mucosa due to endotoxin, cytokine production or other factors is believed to then occur. the aim of this study was to determine whether spray-dried bovine colostrum demonstrated potential in vitro as a prophylactic for nec. antiadherence was measured using a tissue culture assay and antibody levels against enterobacteriaceae were determined by elisa. the effect of bovine  colostrum on the production of cytokines implicated in nec was determined by a multiplex bead assay. enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens and klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae were common in both nec positive and nec negative infants and iga and igg1 antibodies to these species were present in the bovine colostrum. pretreatment with bovine colostrum  produced a significant decrease (p<0.001) in attachment of bacteria to ht-29 cells. bovine colostrum significantly increased the production of il-8 in ht-29 cells and il-8, il-6 and tnf-alpha in thp-1 cells (p<0.001). the potential of bovine colostrum to increase the production of inflammatory mediators could limit its usefulness.

TI  == influence of culture site-specific mic distributions on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of piperacillin/tazobactam and piperacillin: a data analysis.
AB  == background: investigators who perform pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pk-pd) modeling with monte carlo simulation have historically not stratified microbiological data by culture site. this lack of stratification might be problematic if susceptibility patterns differ among sites and might lead to differences in pk-pd. objective: this study compared the pk-pd of 2 antimicrobial regimens against 5 gram-negative bacterial species form 3 culture sites. methods: this data analysis was performed at the department of pharmacology, the university of texas health science center, san antonio, texas. blood, pulmonary (ie, bronchial, endotracheal, lung, respiratory, sputum, and tracheal secretions), and wound distributions of mics were extracted from the 2002 intensive care unit surveillance system database. bacteria included acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the pk properties of piperacillin/tazobactam (3.375 g every 4 hours) and piperacillin (3 g every 4 hours) were obtained from studies in healthy volunteers. monte carlo simulation was used in 10,000 patients for each antimicrobial-bacteria-culture site combination. the cumulative fraction of response (cfr) for a free percentage time above the mic of > or =50% was determined for each combination, and a clinically significant difference was defined a priori as > or =10%. results: data from 2408 pulmonary, 490 blood, and  242 wound isolates were included. for piperacillin/tazobactam, the cfr varied <10% by culture site in all 5 bacterial species. site-specific differences were noted in mic50 for piperacillin versus e cloacae and e coli and mic90 for piperacillin/tazobactam versus k pneumoniae and p aeruginosa. likewise, for piperacillin, the cfr was similar among the 3 culture sites for p aeruginosa. however, the cfr for piperacillin varied by > or =10% for a baumannii (blood > wound), e cloacae (pulmonary > blood), e coli (pulmonary and blood > wound), and  k pneumoniae (wound > blood). conclusions: the pk-pd models based on pk properties found in healthy humans and site-specific mic distributions in this study suggest that for piperacillin, culture-site differences subsequently resulted in cfr differences that exceeded a predetermined level of clinical significance. furthermore, these data suggest that traditional reporting strategies for microbiological data (ie, mic50 and mic90) might fail to adequately characterize the mic population.

TI  == ft-ir microspectroscopy for early identification of some clinically relevant pathogens.
AB  == aims: to investigate the potentials and limitations of fourier transform-infrared (ft-ir) microspectroscopy as a tool to identify, at the level of microcolonies, pathogenic bacteria frequently isolated in the clinical environment. methods and  results: a total of 1570 ft-ir spectra from 164 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients were recorded from 6 to 10-h old microcolonies of 50-150 microm size. a classification of 100% was obtained for the most frequent gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium at the species level. an average accuracy of about 80% was reached with gram negative bacteria from the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonaceae families; enterobacter aerogenes,  enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella spp., and citrobacter koseri; and proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. results were comparable with ft-ir measurements on dried suspensions from 18-h cultures. conclusions: early identification of young microcolonies is feasible with ft-ir microscopy with a very high accuracy for gram-positive bacteria. some improvement in the transfer of microcolonies is  necessary to increase the accuracy for gram-negative bacteria. significance and impact of the study: combination of ft-ir microscopy and multivariate data analysis could be a complementary, rapid, and reliable tool for screening and discriminating, at species and subspecies level, micro-organisms of clinical, food-borne, or environmental origins.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in taiwan: epidemiology, detection, treatment and infection control.
AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) efficiently hydrolyze extended-spectrum beta-lactams such as cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and aztreonam. esbls are most often plasmid-mediated. in taiwan, the prevalence of esbls in bacteria has risen, ranging from 8.5 to 29.8% in klebsiella pneumoniae and 1.5 to 16.7% in escherichia coli isolates. the most prevalent types of esbls are shv-5, shv-12, ctx-m-3, and ctx-m-14 in isolates of k. pneumoniae and e. coli, with differences  between institutions. shv-12 and ctx-m-3 have been reported as the most common esbls in isolates of enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens, respectively.  molecular epidemiology studies suggest that the esbl-encoding genes have been disseminated either by proliferation of epidemic strains or by transfer of plasmids carrying the resistance traits. the current esbl screen guidelines of the clinical and laboratory standards institute (formerly national committee for  clinical laboratory standards) are issued for e. coli, klebsiella spp., and proteus mirabilis. owing to the lack of standard methods, it remains difficult to assure the presence of esbl in an isolate co-harboring an ampc beta-lactamase, particularly in cases where the latter is produced in larger amounts than the former. empirical therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam to replace third-generation cephalosporins may help to reduce the occurrence of esbls in an  institution with a high prevalence of esbl producers. carbapenems remain the drugs of choice for serious infections caused by esbl-producing organisms. to retard the selection for carbapenem-resistant bacteria, 7-alpha-methoxy beta-lactams or fourth-generation cephalosporins can be therapeutic alternatives  for mild-to-moderate infections provided that the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic target can be easily achieved.

AB  == the aim of this study was to search for plasmid-encoded quinolone resistance determinants qnra and qnrs in fluoroquinolone-resistant and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacterial isolates recovered in sydney, australia, in 2002. twenty-three fluoroquinolone-resistant, of which 16 were also esbl-positive, enterobacterial and nonrelated isolates were studied. pcr with primers specific for qnra and qnrs genes and primers specific for a series of esbl genes were used. a qnra gene was identified in two esbl-positive isolates, whereas no qnrs-positive strain was found. the qnra1 determinant was identified in an enterobacter cloacae isolate and in a carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae isolate, both of which expressed the same esbl shv- 12. whereas no plasmid was identified in the e. cloacae isolate, k. pneumoniae k149 possessed two conjugative plasmids, one that harbored the qnra and bla (shv)-12 genes whereas the other expressed the carbapenemase gene bla (imp-4). the qnra gene, was located in both cases downstream of the orf513 recombinase gene and upstream  of the qnra1 gene, a structure identical to that found in sul1-type integron in36 and qnra-positive strains from shanghai, china. however, the gene cassettes of the sul1-type integrons were different. this study identified the first plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinant in enterobacteriaceae in australia.

TI  == dissemination and persistence of blactx-m-9 are linked to class 1 integrons containing cr1 associated with defective transposon derivatives from tn402 located in early antibiotic resistance plasmids of inchi2, incp1-alpha, and incfi groups.
AB  == this study analyzes the diversity of in60, a class 1 integron bearing cr1 and containing bla(ctx-m-9), and its association with tn402, tn21, and classical conjugative plasmids among 45 ctx-m-9-producing clinical strains (41 escherichia  coli strains, 2 klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 1 salmonella enterica strain, and  1 enterobacter cloacae strain). forty-five patients in a spanish tertiary care hospital were studied (1996 to 2003). the diversity of in60 and association of in60 with tn402 or mercury resistance transposons were investigated by overlapping pcr assays and/or hybridization. plasmid characterization included comparison of restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns and determination of incompatibility group by pcr-based replicon typing, sequencing, and hybridization. ctx-m-9 plasmids belonged to inchi2 (n = 26), incp-1alpha (n = 10), incfi (n = 4), and inci (n = 1) groups. genetic platforms containing bla(ctx-m-9) were classified in six types in relation to the in60 backbone and in eight subtypes in relation to tn402 derivatives. they were associated with tn21 sequences when located in incp-1alpha or inchi2 plasmids. our study identified bla(ctx-m-9) in a high diversity of cr1-bearing class 1 integrons linked to different tn402 derivatives, often to tn21, highlighting the role of recombination events in the evolution of antibiotic resistance plasmids. the presence of bla(ctx-m-9) on broad-host-range incp-1alpha plasmids might contribute to its dissemination to hosts that were not members of the family enterobacteriaceae.

AB  == background: the prevalence of bacterial contamination of random-donor platelet concentrates (pcs) is considerably lower than that of blood donations. which key  steps of the preparation procedure contribute to the elimination of bacteria was  investigated. study design and methods: ten bacteria species were used. blood donations were spiked with bacteria and stored at 22 degrees c for 8 hours. the buffy coats were kept for 6 hours. pcs were prepared from pools of 4 buffy coats. at each preparation step and during pc storage, bacteria contents were measured.  in additional experiments, the titers of spiked blood and buffy coats were determined after storage at 20, 22, or 24 degrees c for 8 and up to 24 hours, respectively. results: enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica were completely inactivated during storage in blood or buffy coats. titer reduction was between 3.32 and 4.62 log. bacillus cereus, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis did not multiply. compared with their values in spiked blood the titers in the pcs were reduced by 1.7 to 2.8 log. klebsiella pneumoniae was the only species that grew in blood. with the exception of p. acnes, those species that were not removed by the preparation process multiplied in the pcs. remarkable donor-to-donor variations of the bactericidal activities of buffy coats were detected when the storage time was prolonged to 24 hours. conclusions: bacteria are significantly eliminated by the preparation procedure for random donor pcs. also, blood and buffy coats are bactericidal for  most species. when buffy-coat storage is prolonged, it cannot, however, be predicted whether specific strains vanish or multiply.

TI  == confirmation of e. coli among other thermotolerant coliform bacteria in paper mill effluents, wood chips screening rejects and paper sludges.
AB  == paper sludges are solid wastes material generated from the paper production, which have been characterized for their chemical contents. some are rich in wood  fiber and are a good carbon source, for example the primary and de-inking paper sludges. others are made rich in nitrogen and phosphorus by pressing the activated sludge, resulting from the biological water treatments, with the primary sludge, yielding the combined paper sludge. still, in the absence of sanitary effluents very few studies have addressed the characterization of their  coliform microflora. therefore, this study investigated the thermotolerant coliform population of one paper mill effluent and two paper mill sludges and wood chips screening rejects using chromogenic media. for the first series of analyses, the medium used was colilert broth and positive tubes were selected to  isolate bacteria in pure culture on macconkey agar. in a second series of analyses, double selective media, based on ss-galactosidase and ss-glucuronidase  activities, were used to isolate bacteria. first, the presence of thermotolerant  coliforms was detected in low numbers in most water effluents, but showed that the entrance of the thermotolerant coliforms was early in the industrial process. also, large numbers of thermotolerant coliforms, i.e., 7,000,000 mpn/g sludge (dry weight; d.w.), were found in combined sludges. from this first series of isolations, bacteria were purified on macconkey medium and identified as citrobacter freundii, enterobacter sp, e. sakazakii, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, k. pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis, k. pneumoniae subsp.  ozaenae, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, pantoea sp, raoultella terrigena, r. planticola. second, the presence of thermotolerant coliforms was measured at more than 3,700-6,000 mpn/g (d.w) sludge, whereas e. coli was detected from 730 to more than 3,300 mpn/g (d.w.) sludge. the presence of thermotolerant coliform bacteria and e. coli was sometimes detected from wood chips screening rejects in  large quantities. also, indigenous e. coli were able to multiply into the combined sludge, and inoculated e. coli isolates were often able to multiply in wood chips and combined sludge media. in this second series of isolations, api20e and biolog identified most isolates as e. coli, but others remained unidentified. the sequences of the 16s rdna confirmed that most isolates were likely e. coli, few burkholderia spp, but 10% of the isolates remained unidentified. this study points out that the coliform bacteria are introduced by the wood chips in the water effluents, where they can survive throught the primary clarifier and regrow in combined sludges.

TI  == [clinical observation of the effects of fe combined enzymes on the infection of the granulation burn wound during late post burns stage].
AB  == objective: to observe the effects of combined fe enzymes on the infection of the  granulation burn wound during late postburn stage in controlling burn wound infection caused by common antibiotic resistant bacteria. methods: thirty patients in our burn ward were enrolled and were randomly divided into a [treated with combined fe enzymes (50 ml dissolved in 0-150 ml normal saline to reach the  final concentration of 1-3 u/ml)] and b (treated with gentamicin) groups, with 15 patients in each group. several layers of gauze, either soaked with combined fe enzyme in a or gentamicin in b group, were used to cover the burn wounds once to  twice a day. bacterial culture from the burn wound exudation before and after drug administration was done before the application of the agents. the bacteria in the burn wounds and their susceptibility to antibiotics were identified. the healing time of the burn wounds was recorded. furthermore, the healing rate of the burn wound was recorded on the 3rd, 5th, 8th, 10th and 12th post skin grafting days (psgd). results: the dominating bacteria in the burn wounds in both groups were pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and mrsa. the susceptibility rate of bacteria ( mrsa, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyte, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae) to combined fe enzyme was 93.8%, 100.0%, 100.0%, 100.0%, 100.0% and 95.0% respectively, which were much higher than those in b group (17.6%, 31.3%, 28.6%, 44.0%, 33.3%, 28.0% respectively, p < 0.1. the wound healing time after skin grafting in a group (10.6 +/- 1.5 days) was significantly shorter than that in b group (15.3 +/- 1.7 days, p < 0.01). the wound healing rate on 10 psgd in a group was (85.4 +/- 2.4)%, and which was only (51.3 +/- 1.5% in b group (p < 0.01) conclusion: combined fe enzyme can effectively control burn wound infection, so that the interval between skin grafting and wound healing can be shortened and success rate of skin grafting be improved.

TI  == bacteriological urinalysis in patients after renal transplantation.
AB  == the study consisted of microbiological urinalysis performed in 269 patients after renal transplantation who remained under medical care at the outpatient service of the transplantation institute in warsaw. the patients enrolled into the study  had undergone renal transplantation 6 to 72 months before urine samples were collected. 304 urinalysis were performed. in the group of 269 patients, 42 individuals had bacteria in their urine what was confirmed in 47 urine cultures.  cases of bacteriuria were divided into 5 groups: 5 cases of symptomatic urinary tract infection (5 individuals--2% of all studied patients), 27 cases of asymptomatic bacteriuria in 22 individuals (8% of all studied patients), 5 cases  of insignificant bacteriuria in 5 patients (2%), 10 cases of involuntary urine contamination in 10 cases (4%). eventually, urinary tract infection (uti) was established in 27 patients (5 cases of symptomatic uti and 22 cases of asymptomatic uti) what makes out for 10% of all studied patients. in cases where  urinalysis showed significant bacteriuria, following pathogens were detected in urine cultures: escherichia coli: 22 strains, enterococcus faecalis--4 strains, enterobacter cloacae--2 strains and 1 strains of ralstonia picketii, streptococcus uberis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis. over 90% of gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, as well as to amikacin and aztreonam which are the drugs usually administered intravenously in hospitalized patients. the only drug of similar efficacy, which  could be administered orally in outpatients was fosfomycin.

TI  == purification and characterization of trzf: biuret hydrolysis by allophanate hydrolase supports growth.
AB  == trzf, the allophanate hydrolase from enterobacter cloacae strain 99, was cloned,  overexpressed in the presence of a chaperone protein, and purified to homogeneity. native trzf had a subunit molecular weight of 65,401 and a subunit stoichiometry of alpha(2) and did not contain significant levels of metals. trzf  showed time-dependent inhibition by phenyl phosphorodiamidate and is a member of  the amidase signature protein family. trzf was highly active in the hydrolysis of allophanate but was not active with urea, despite having been previously considered a urea amidolyase. trzf showed lower activity with malonamate, malonamide, and biuret. the allophanate hydrolase from pseudomonas sp. strain adp, atzf, was also shown to hydrolyze biuret slowly. since biuret and allophanate are consecutive metabolites in cyanuric acid metabolism, the low level of biuret hydrolase activity can have physiological significance. a recombinant escherichia coli strain containing atzd, encoding cyanuric acid hydrolase that produces biuret, and atzf grew slowly on cyanuric acid as a source of nitrogen. the amount of growth produced was consistent with the liberation of  3 mol of ammonia from cyanuric acid. in vitro, trzf was shown to hydrolyze biuret to liberate 3 mol of ammonia. the biuret hydrolyzing activity of trzf might also  be physiologically relevant in native strains. e. cloacae strain 99 grows on cyanuric acid with a significant accumulation of biuret.

AB  == a novel plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance gene, qnrb, has been discovered in  a plasmid encoding the ctx-m-15 beta-lactamase from a klebsiella pneumoniae strain isolated in south india. it has less than 40% amino acid identity with the original qnr (now qnra) gene or with the recently described qnrs but, like them,  codes for a protein belonging to the pentapeptide repeat family. strains with qnrb demonstrated low-level resistance to all quinolones tested. the gene has been cloned in an expression vector attaching a polyhistidine tag, which facilitated purification to >or=95% homogeneity. as little as 5 pm of qnrb-his6 protected purified dna gyrase against inhibition by 2 microg/ml (6 microm) ciprofloxacin. with a pcr assay qnrb has been detected in citrobacter koseri, enterobacter cloacae, and escherichia coli isolates from the united states, linked to shv-12 beta-lactamase and coding for a product differing in five amino  acids from the indian (now qnrb1) variety. the qnrb gene has been found near orf1005 in some, but not all, plasmids and in association with open reading frames matching known chromosomal genes, suggesting that it too was acquired by plasmids from an as-yet-unknown bacterial source.

TI  == characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing kuwait and  uk strains identified by the vitek system, and subsequent comparison of the vitek system with other commercial esbl-testing systems using these strains.
AB  == two hundred and fifty-one unique patient isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae (123), escherichia coli (114), klebsiella oxytoca (7), enterobacter cloacae (5) and citrobacter freundii (2), flagged as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) positive by the vitek system (gns-526 card), were collected. these strains were isolated from a variety of clinical specimens submitted to the clinical bacteriology laboratories of the royal infirmary of edinburgh (rie), edinburgh, uk (and associated gp practices), hairmyers hospital, glasgow, uk, and the amiri  and farwania hospitals, kuwait. of the 101 rie strains tested, 15 e. coli strains were found to be esbl negative by etest esbl strips. on retesting the 15 e. coli  strains with the vitek gns-532 card, 14 were found to be esbl negative, despite being originally flagged as esbl positive. the remaining 236 esbl-producing strains were also subjected to the double disc-diffusion (ddd) technique for the  detection of esbls. of these, two were false negatives by etest esbl test strips  (using both cefotaxime and ceftazidime strips), and 38 were false negatives by the ddd method. the etest false-negative esbl-producing strains of k. pneumoniae  were positive by ddd. technically, the vitek method was the least demanding method to perform, as it was an integral part of the routine susceptibility test  card. etest strips were reliable, but were the most expensive of all the techniques used. the ddd test, while relatively inexpensive, was technically subjective, and in our hands, seven of the esbl-positive strains that were confirmed by the other two techniques were not detected. despite the false-positive esbl-producing e. coli strains, the vitek susceptibility card with its integral esbl test offers the clinical laboratory a valuable and quick option to screen for esbl-producing klebsiella spp. and e. coli as part of the routine laboratory methodology.

TI  == clonal occurrences of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli: report from the  meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection surveillance program  in the united states (2004).
AB  == the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection program is a global, longitudinal resistance surveillance network of more than 100 medical centers worldwide monitoring the susceptibility of bacterial pathogens to carbapenems and other broad-spectrum agents. between 1999 and 2004, a total of 10-16 us medical centers referred up to 200 nonduplicate isolates from clinical infections to a central processing laboratory. over this 6-year period, the antimicrobial activity of 12 broad-spectrum agents was assessed against 15990 bacterial isolates using clinical and laboratory standards institute (formerly the national committee for clinical laboratory standards) reference methods. analysis of the mic results by year within organism species and/or organism groups revealed a continued decrease in fluoroquinolone susceptibility (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin), especially among indole-positive proteae (-22.1%), escherichia coli (-17.0%), enterobacter species (-10.0%), and proteus mirabilis (-7.6%) isolates. antibiogram analysis of strains demonstrating multidrug resistance from the same institutions were further characterized by automated ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to determine clonality. in 2004, a total of 165 selected multidrug-resistant (mdr) strains produced 64 different ribotypes with the largest representing 31 escherichia coli isolates from 6 medical centers. other clusters were also identified within single medical centers among enterobacter cloacae (6 strains), providencia stuartii (5 strains), and morganella morganii (4 strains). a significant clonal outbreak encompassing 40 acinetobacter baumannii isolates from 3 centers in a single endemic region was identified in 1999 and has persisted through 2004. continued surveillance of these broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents against mdr pathogens appears warranted to monitor the incidence and spread of resistant clones causing serious infections. possible emergence of resistance mechanisms via clonal dissemination  proves to be among the principle threats that compromise carbapenem therapy, where meropenem maintains the broadest spectrum of coverage.

TI  == basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: flow cytometry (facs) is a common technique in blood banking. it is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. it was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (pcs).  study design and methods: plasma-reduced pcs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees c for various times. the following 10 species were used: bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica. bacterial dna was stained with thiazole orange. after the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by facs. results: all bacteria species used were detectable by facs. the lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microl, that is, 10(5) per ml. in general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. in one  case (k. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with  that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. when pc samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per ml of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees c, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. exceptions were e. cloacae and p. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. at 20 to 24 degrees c, the detection times were strongly prolonged. conclusion: sterility testing of pcs by facs is a feasible approach. the present  data suggest incubating pc samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees c before testing. for slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1  to 2 days.

TI  == plasmid-mediated high-level gentamicin resistance among enteric bacteria isolated from pet turtles in louisiana.
AB  == the sale of small turtles is banned by the food and drug administration from the  u.s. market due to concerns about their excretion of salmonella spp. to produce a safe pet for the export market, the louisiana pet turtle industry uses gentamicin sulfate baths (1,000 microg/ml) to eradicate salmonella spp. from turtle eggs. in 1999, we analyzed bacterial samples recovered from turtle farms and found that strains of salmonella enterica subsp. arizonae and other bacteria, such as enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia, were resistant to high concentrations of gentamicin (>2,000 microg/ml) and to other aminoglycosides. the goal of this study was to identify the gene(s) which contributes to the high-level gentamicin resistance phenotype observed in bacteria from environmental samples with turtle farming activity, particularly the salmonellae, and to estimate the incidence of such genes in these bacteria. r plasmids from gentamicin-resistant strains were transferred by conjugation and transformation to naive escherichia coli cells. cloning and sequencing of the gentamicin resistance determinants on these plasmids revealed the presence of the aminoglycoside acetyltransferase genes aac(3)-iia and aac(3)-via; the latter was present as a gene cassette of a class 1 integron. multiplex pcr assays showed that every gentamicin-resistant isolate carried one of these acetyltransferase genes. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and restriction enzyme digestion analysis of r plasmids carrying these genes revealed different restriction profiles and sizes, indicating a dissemination of  the gentamicin resistance genes through mobile molecular elements. the data presented highlight the need to develop an alternate method for the eradication of salmonella spp. from turtle eggs.

TI  == two novel bacterial biosensors for detection of nitrate availability in the rhizosphere.
AB  == the nitrate-regulated promoter of narg in escherichia coli was fused to promoterless ice nucleation (inaz) and green fluorescent protein (gfp) reporter genes to yield the nitrate-responsive gene fusions in plasmids pnice and pngfp, respectively. while the promoter of narg is normally nitrate responsive only under anaerobic conditions, the l28h-fnr gene was provided in trans to enable nitrate-dependent expression of these reporter gene fusions even under aerobic conditions in both e. coli dh5alpha and enterobacter cloacae ecct501r. e. cloacae and e. coli cells containing the fusion plasmid pnice exhibited more than 100-fold-higher ice nucleation activity in cultures amended with 10 mm sodium nitrate than in nitrate-free media. the gfp fluorescence of e. cloacae cells harboring pngfp was uniform at a given concentration of nitrate and increased about 1,000-fold when nitrate increased from 0 to 1 mm. measurable induction of ice nucleation in e. cloacae ecct501r harboring pnice occurred at nitrate concentrations of as low as 0.1 microm, while gfp fluorescence was detected in cells harboring pngfp at about 10 microm. in the rhizosphere of wild oat (avena fatua), the whole-cell bioreporter e.cloacae(pngfp) or e. cloacae(pnice) expressed significantly higher gfp fluorescence or ice nucleation activity when the plants were grown in natural soils amended with nitrate than in unamended natural soils. significantly lower nitrate abundance was detected by the e. cloacae(pngfp) reporter in the a. fatua rhizosphere compared to in bulk soil, indicating plant competition for nitrate. ice- and gfp-based bacterial sensors thus are useful for estimating nitrate availability in relevant microbial niches  in natural environments.

TI  == comparison of the minimum inhibitory, mutant prevention and minimum bactericidal  concentrations of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and garenoxacin against enteric gram-negative urinary tract infection pathogens.
AB  == acute, uncomplicated urinary tract infections (utis) are among the most commonly  encountered bacterial infections and management has been made more complicated in the last decade due to the trend toward increasing antimicrobial resistance to ampicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (tmp/smx). fluoroquinolones are suggested as alternative antimicrobials for the treatment of utis in communities  for which tmp/smx resistance is > or = 10%. the mutant-prevention concentration (mpc) is a novel susceptibility parameter designed to minimize the selection of first-step resistant mutants present in large, > or = 10(10) cfu/ml, heterogeneous bacterial populations and is a distinct measurement from minimum inhibitory concentration testing. we measured mpc results for 80 enteric gram-negative and 20 pseudomonas aeruginosa urinary isolates against ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and garenoxacin. ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and garenoxacin mpc results for escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter  cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa respectively were 0.5, 1, 1, 1 and 4 mg/l; 1, 2, 4, 2 and 16 mg/l; 1, 8, >8, 4 and > or = 32 mg/l. by comparison, minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)90 results for the enterobacteriaceae organisms ranged from < or = 0.06-4 mg/l for the three drugs and 1-4 mg/l against p. aeruginosa. similarly, mbc90 results ranged from < or = 0.06-4 mg/l and 2-8 mg/l respectively. for ciprofloxacin against e. coli, e. cloacae and k. pneumoniae and for levofloxacin against e. coli, c. freundii and k. pneumoniae, mpc results were below susceptible breakpoints and within clinically achievable and sustainable drug concentrations for >24 hours of the dosing interval against. for garenoxacin, urine drug concentrations are expected  to be in excess of mpc results for the entire length of the dosing interval for e. coli. application of mpcs to fluoroquinolones and management of utis represents a situation where high levels of in vitro activity, based on low mics, is reflected in correspondingly low mpc values for most of the organisms tested.  incorporation of mpc strategies into current fluoroquinolone dosing in uti represents a realistic approach for preventing the further selection of resistant organisms associated with utis.

TI  == relationships between antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance in gram-negative bacteria causing nosocomial infections from 1991-2003 at a university hospital in taiwan.
AB  == this study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial use in a university hospital in taiwan. disk susceptibility data of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter spp., stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli causing nosocomial infections were evaluated. data on annual patient-days and annual consumption (defined daily dose (ddd) per 1000 patient-days) of extended-spectrum cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, flumoxef, cefepime and cefpirome), beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations (ticarcillin/clavulanic acid and piperacillin/tazobactam), carbapenems (imipenem  and meropenem), aminoglycosides (amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin), fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin (oral and injectable) and oral levofloxacin and moxifloxacin) from 1991 to 2003 were analysed. increasing trends of incidences of several of these bacteria causing all nosocomial infections or nosocomial bloodstream infections were noted from 1991 to 2003. the annual patient-days of the hospital significantly increased, from 360210 in 1991 to 672676 in 2002 (linear regression analysis, p < 0.05), but slightly decreased in 2003 (629168) owing to the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in taiwan. the rise in cefotaxime-resistant or ciprofloxacin-resistant e. coli and meropenem-resistant p. aeruginosa was significantly correlated with increased consumption of extended-spectrum cephalosporins, beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides (for ciprofloxacin-resistant e. coli and meropenem-resistant p. aeruginosa only) in the hospital (pearson's correlation coefficient, r > 0.72 (or < -0.72) and p-value < 0.05). increased ciprofloxacin-resistant k. pneumoniae and meropenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. was significantly associated with the increased usage of extended-spectrum cephalosporins but not with the other four classes of antibiotics. this 13-year study in a hospital demonstrated significant changes in antimicrobial use, which may have affected antimicrobial resistance in certain gram-negative bacteria at the hospital.

TI  == [profiles of the utilization of 20 amino acids as the only source of nitrogen and carbon in bacteria of the genera klebsiella, enterobacter, serratia, escherichia].
AB  == the profiles of the utilization of 20 protein amino acids in 118 klebsiella pneumoniae sub- sp. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, k. planticola, k. mobilis, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marscescens, s. liquefaciens, escherichia coli strains isolated from clinical material were studied. the utilization of amino acids was determined on minimal saline agar containing amino acid as the only source of nitrogen and carbon; the results were evaluated after 72-hour incubation at 37 degrees c. 17 profiles of amino-acid utilization were thus determined, most of them genus-specific in enterobacteria: klebsiella (profiles no. 1--6, 9, 10), enterobacter (no. 11--13), serratia (no. 14--16), escherichia (no. 17). the full coincidence of amino-acid utilization profiles in bacteria of  k. mobilis (no. 1, 6) and k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae with out of such profiles in bacteria of the genera enterobacter, serratia, escherichia was established, which confirmed that k. mobilis (formerly enterobacter aerogenes) belonged to the genus klebsiella.

TI  == a beta-lactamase with reduced immunogenicity for the targeted delivery of chemotherapeutics using antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy.
AB  == antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (adept) delivers chemotherapeutic agents in high concentration to tumor tissue while minimizing systemic drug exposure. beta-lactamases are particularly useful enzymes for adept systems due to their unique substrate specificity that allows the activation of a variety of lactam-based prodrugs with minimal interference from mammalian enzymes. we evaluated the amino acid sequence of beta-lactamase from enterobacter cloacae for the presence of human t-cell epitopes using a cell-based proliferation assay using samples from 65 community donors. we observed a low background response that is consistent with a lack of preexposure to this enzyme. beta-lactamase was  found to contain four cd4+ t-cell epitopes. for two of these epitopes, we identified single amino acid changes that result in significantly reduced proliferative responses while retaining stability and activity of the enzyme. the beta-lactamase variant containing both changes induces significantly less proliferation in human and mouse cell assays, and 5-fold lower levels of igg1 in  mice were observed after repeat administration of beta-lactamase variant with adjuvant. the beta-lactamase variant should be very suitable for the construction of adept fusion proteins, as it combines high activity toward lactam prodrugs, high plasma stability, a monomeric architecture, and a relatively low risk of eliciting an immune response in patients.

TI  == survival curves for microbial species stored by freeze-drying.
AB  == the survival of a variety of species of microorganism following storage for up to 20 years has been analyzed. the organisms were freeze-dried, sealed in ampoules under vacuum (<1 pa) and stored in the dark at 5 degrees c. the yeast that was tested, saccharomyces cerevisiae, showed only 8% survival when recovered shortly  after freeze-drying, but subsequent loss during storage was the least among all the tested microorganisms. the decrease in the logarithm of survival per year (log survival) was -0.010, which corresponds to a survival rate of 97.7% per year. the gram-negative bacteria tested, escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, and enterobacter cloacae, showed 42.6, 33.5, and 50.8% survival shortly after freeze-drying, which was higher than the corresponding survival of s. cerevisiae, but the subsequent loss during storage was greater than s. cerevisiae, the log survival figures being -0.041, -0.058, and -0.073 per year. these values correspond to survival rates of 91.0, 87.5, and 84.5% each year. the gram-positive bacteria tested, lactobacillus acidophilus and enteroccoccus faecium, showed 62.5 and 85.2% survival shortly after freeze-drying, which was even higher than that of the gram-negative species, and these organisms also showed better survival during storage than gram-negative bacteria; their log survival rates were -0.018 and -0.016 per year, which corresponded to survival rates of almost 96% per year. comparison of these results with other published data for different drying conditions suggests that survival during storage is strongly influenced by the degree of vacuum under which the ampoules were sealed. the excellent survival after freeze-drying of each species might be attributable  to the high level of desiccation and to sealing under vacuum.

TI  == dissemination of the metallo-beta-lactamase gene blaimp-4 among gram-negative pathogens in a clinical setting in australia.
AB  == background: the clinical utility of carbapenems is under threat because of the emergence of acquired metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl) genes. we describe the first outbreak in australia of infection and/or colonization with gram-negative pathogens carrying the mbl gene blaimp-4. methods: mbl-producing organisms were identified using susceptibility data in conjunction with mbl screening methods. pcr and sequence analysis were performed to characterize the resistance gene and  identify the presence of integrons. dna profiles were determined by ribotyping. clinical and epidemiological data were prospectively collected from january-july  2004. results: a total of 19 isolates were recovered from 16 patients: serratia marcescens (10 isolates), klebsiella pneumoniae (4 isolates), pseudomonas aeruginosa (3 isolates), escherichia coli (1 isolate), and enterobacter cloacae (1 isolate). isolates were resistant to most beta-lactams except aztreonam, and variable resistance to carbapenems was observed (mic range, 2 to >8 mg/l). pcr and sequence analysis identified the blaimp-4 gene and a class 1 integrase (inti1) in all isolates. of the 16 patients, 12 (75%) had infection; 5 had septicemia, 5 had ventilator-associated pneumonia, 1 had a urinary tract infection, and 1 had a superficial central venous line infection. six (38%) of the 16 patients died, and 5 of those 6 (31% of the group of 16) had clinical infection with an mbl-producing organism. all except 2 patients had spatio-temporal epidemiological links in the intensive care unit. all k. pneumoniae isolates were of different ribogroups, whereas the s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa isolates were predominately of the same ribogroup. conclusions: mbl-producing gram-negative organisms have now emerged in australia. the resistance gene, blaimp-4, appears highly mobile; this outbreak involved 5 different gram-negative genera from patients with close epidemiological links.

TI  == high prevalence of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinant qnra in  multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae from blood cultures in liverpool, uk.
AB  == objectives: to determine the prevalence of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance qnra gene in a selected collection of blood culture isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to both ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime. methods: over  a 29 month period, a total of 47 non-repetitive isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to both ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime were identified. isolates were screened for the presence of the qnra gene, class i integrons and bla(esbl) by pcr. transferability was examined by conjugation with the sodium azide-resistant  escherichia coli j53. all qnra-positive isolates were examined for dna-relatedness by pfge. results: a total of 15 of the 47 test isolates (32%) were positive for the qnra gene, and included single isolates of e. coli and citrobacter freundii, 4 klebsiella pneumoniae and 9 enterobacter cloacae. all 15  qnra-positive isolates carried class 1 integrons, and 11 the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene bla(shv-12). by pfge two k. pneumoniae and three e. cloacae,  respectively, were considered clonally but not temporally related. plasmid transfer of quinolone resistance was only achieved with single isolates of k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae. both plasmids carried class 1 integrons with a psal-1-like gene cassette arrangement intl1-aada2-qacedelta-sul1. conclusions: in this selected group of ciprofloxacin- and cefotaxime-resistant bacteria, carriage of the qnra gene was high (32%). this compares with <2.0% as demonstrated in worldwide studies of laboratory collections of ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria.  the majority of qnra-positive isolates in our study originated from high-dependency care units within our hospital, but were shown not to be clonal by pfge. this is the first report of qnra-positive enterobacteriaceae in the united kingdom.

TI  == surveillance of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases from clinical samples and faecal carriers in barcelona, spain.
AB  == objectives: the aim of the present study was to characterize and compare the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing organisms isolated from clinical samples and faecal carriers in 2001 and 2002. methods: a total of 5251 enterobacteriaceae isolated from clinical samples and 1321 stool samples were evaluated for the presence of esbls. the stool samples were spread onto plates of macconkey agar containing 2 mg/l cefotaxime for selection of esbl-producing strains. these strains were defined as those showing synergism between amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and third-generation cephalosporins. the beta-lactamases involved were characterized by isoelectric focusing, pcr assays and dna sequencing. results: the prevalence of esbl-producing strains among clinical enterobacteriaceae was 1.7%. of these, 87.6% produced ctx-m, 25.8% produced shv and 2.2% were tem-type-producing strains. all clinical esbl-producing strains were escherichia coli, with the exception of four klebsiella pneumoniae and one citrobacter freundii. the prevalence of faecal carriage of esbl-producing organisms was 3.3%. of these, 75% produced ctx-m-type  enzymes followed by 22.7% shv-producing strains. all faecal esbl-producing strains were e. coli except for one enterobacter cloacae and one proteus mirabilis. this latter strain produced the per-1 enzyme reported for the first time in spain. conclusions: the prevalence of esbl-producing strains in stool samples was higher than that observed in clinical samples from the same period. the different types of esbls found were similar in both contexts. the most prevalent esbls were the ctx-m-related enzymes, with nine different types, followed by shv-12.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in outpatient urinary isolates: final results from the north american urinary tract infection collaborative alliance (nautica).
AB  == the goal of the north american urinary tract infection collaborative alliance (nautica) study was to determine antibiotic susceptibility to commonly used agents for urinary tract infections against outpatient urinary isolates obtained  in various geographic regions in the usa and canada. forty-one medical centres (30 from the usa and 11 from canada) participated, with each centre submitting up to 50 consecutive outpatient midstream urine isolates. isolates were identified to species level by the standard protocol of each laboratory. susceptibility testing was determined using the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) microdilution method. resistance breakpoints used were those published by the nccls, including: ampicillin (resistant > or = 32 microg/ml), sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (smx/tmp) (resistant > or = 4 microg/ml), nitrofurantoin (resistant > or = 128 microg/ml), ciprofloxacin (resistant > or =  4 microg/ml) and levofloxacin (resistant > or = 8 microg/ml). of the 1990 isolates collected, 75.1% (1494) were collected from the usa and 24.9% (496) were collected from canada. the mean age of the patients was 48.3 years (range 1 month to 99 years), and 79.5% and 20.5% of isolates were obtained from women and men, respectively. the most common organisms were escherichia coli (57.5%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.4%), enterococcus spp. (6.6%), proteus mirabilis (5.4%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9%), citrobacter spp. (2.7%), staphylococcus aureus (2.2%), enterobacter cloacae (1.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (1.3%), staphylococcus saprophyticus (1.2%), klebsiella spp. (1.2%), enterobacter aerogenes (1.1%) and streptococcus agalactiae (1.0%). among all 1990 isolates, 45.9% were resistant to ampicillin, 20.4% to smx/tmp, 14.3% to nitrofurantoin, 9.7% to ciprofloxacin and 8.1% to levofloxacin. fluoroquinolone resistance was highest in patients > or = 65 years of age. for the 1142 e. coli isolates, resistance rates were: ampicillin 37.7%, smx/tmp 21.3%, ciprofloxacin 5.5%, levofloxacin 5.1% and nitrofurantoin 1.1%. for all 1990 isolates and for the 1142 e. coli only, resistance rates were significantly higher in us compared with canadian medical centres. this study reports higher rates of antibiotic resistance in us versus canadian outpatient urinary isolates and demonstrates the continuing evolution of resistance to antimicrobial agents.

TI  == pentadactylin: an antimicrobial peptide from the skin secretions of the south american bullfrog leptodactylus pentadactylus.
AB  == norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions were obtained from male specimens of the south american bullfrog, leptodactylus pentadactylus and shown to contain two peptides that inhibited the growth of microorganisms. the primary structure of a  previously undescribed peptide, termed pentadactylin, was established as gly-leu-leu-asp-thr-leu-lys-gly-ala-ala-lys-asn-val-val-gly-ser-leu-ala-ser-lys-v al-met-glu-lys-leu.nh2. the second peptide, which differs from pentadactylin by eight amino acid residues, is identical to fallaxin previously isolated from skin secretions of the caribbean mountain chicken frog l. fallax. pentadactylin inhibited the growth of reference strains of both gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus group b) but potencies were relatively low (mic values in the range 25-200 microm). the peptide showed very low hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (ld50>400 microm).

TI  == glucose-1-phosphatase (agpe) from enterobacter cloacae displays enhanced phytase  activity.
AB  == using a screening procedure developed for detection of phytate hydrolysing enzymes, the gene agpe encoding glucose-1-phosphatase was cloned from an enterobacter cloacae vkpm b2254 plasmid library. sequence analysis revealed 78% identity on nucleotide and 79% identity on peptide level to escherichia coli glucose-1-phosphatase characterising the respective gene product as a representative of acid histidine phosphatases harbouring the rh(g/n)rxrp motif. the purified recombinant protein displayed maximum specific activity of 196 u mg(-1) protein against glucose-1-phosphate but was also active against other sugar phosphates and p-nitrophenyl phosphate. high-performance ion chromatography of hydrolysis products revealed that agpe can act as a 3-phytase but is only able to cleave off the third phosphate group from the myo-inositol sugar ring. based on sequence comparison and catalytic behaviour against phytate, we propose to classify bacterial acid histidine phosphatases/phytases in the three following subclasses: (1) appa-related phytases, (2) phyk-related phytases and (3) agp-related phytases. a distinguished activity of 32 u mg(-1) of protein towards  myo-inositol-hexa-phosphate, which is two times higher than that of e. coli agp,  suggests that possibly functional differences in terms of phytase activity between agp- and appa-like acid histidine phosphatases are fluent.

TI  == [pathogenic characters of infected bacteria after liver transplantation].
AB  == objective: to analyze the main pathogens of infection after the liver transplantation and their antibiotic resistant patterns. methods: the main pathogens of infection after the liver transplantation were retrospectively analyzed. using 3-dimensional tests, esbls (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase), and ampc were detected among the gram negative bacilli. beta-lactamase and van gene in enterococcus were determined by the standard agar dilution susceptibility tests and nitrocefin respectively. results: the main infected strains were enterococcus faecalis (15.0%), enterobacter cloacae (13.9%), fungus (13.3%), and  escherichia coli (10.7%) after the liver transplantation. among them, 32.4% of enterobacter cloacae and 36.8% of escherichia coli produced esbls; 33.8% of enterobacter cloacae and 10.5% of escherichia coli. produced ampc beta-lactamases. the detectable rate of vana gene in enterococcusfaecalis and enterococcus faecium was 7.5% and 11.1%; vanb was 3.8% and 7.4%; vanc was 1.3% and 0, respectively. conclusion: the infection mainly occurs in the intestinal tract after the liver transplantation. the production of esbls and ampc beta-lactamases is the main mechanism of antibiotic resistance. the increased detectable rate of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus should be paid attention to.

TI  == molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  == the complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. however, studies  on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. to clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16s rdna sequences from the dna isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16s rdna libraries were constructed with the amplicons of pcr conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. nine independent libraries were produced  by the application of three sets of primers (set a, set b, and set c) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. the library clone with set a universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. thus, set a primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. on the first day of the life of the infant, enterobacter, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, and streptococcus mitis were present. the largest taxonomic group was l. lactis. on the third day of the  life of the infant, enterobacter, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, s. mitis, and streptococcus salivarius were present. on the sixth day of the life of the infant, citrobacter, clostridium difficile, enterobacter sp., enterobacter cloacae, and e. coli were present. the largest taxonomic group was e. coli. these results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after  the third day.

TI  == development of a multiplex pcr and shv melting-curve mutation detection system for detection of some shv and ctx-m beta-lactamases of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae in taiwan.
AB  == infection by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae has been increasing in taiwan. accurate identification of the esbl genes is necessary for surveillance and for epidemiological studies of the mode of transmission in the hospital setting. we describe herein the development of a novel system, which consists of a multiplex pcr to identify bla(shv), bla(ctx-m-3)-like, and bla(ctx-m-14)-like genes and a modified shv melting-curve  mutation detection method to rapidly distinguish six prevalent bla(shv) genes (bla(shv-1), bla(shv-2), bla(shv-2a), bla(shv-5), bla(shv-11), and bla(shv-12)) in taiwan. sixty-five clinical isolates, which had been characterized by nucleotide sequencing of the bla(shv) and bla(ctx-m) genes, were identified by the system. the system was then used to genotype the esbls from 199 clinical isolates, including 40 enterobacter cloacae, 68 escherichia coli, and 91 klebsiella pneumoniae, collected between august 2002 and march 2003. shv-12 (80 isolates) was the most prevalent type of esbl identified, followed in order of frequency by ctx-m-3 (65 isolates) and ctx-m-14 (36 isolates). seventeen (9%) of  the 199 clinical isolates harbored both shv- and ctx-m-type esbls. in contrast to enterobacter cloacae, the majority of which produced shv-type esbls, e. coli and  k. pneumoniae were more likely to possess ctx-m-type esbls. three rare ctx-m types were identified through sequencing of the bla(ctx-m-3)-like (ctx-m-15) and  bla(ctx-m-14)-like (ctx-m-9 and ctx-m-13) genes. the system appears to provide an efficient differentiation of esbls among e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae in taiwan. moreover, the design of the system can be easily adapted for similar purposes in areas where different esbls are prevalent.

AB  == the increasing emergence of new bacterial beta-lactamases that can efficiently hydrolyze beta-lactam antibiotics to clinically inactive carboxylic acids has created an intractable problem in the treatment of bacterial infections, and it is highly desirable to develop a useful tool that can rapidly screen bacteria for beta-lactamases against a variety of antibiotic candidates in a high-throughput manner. this paper describes the use of a fluorescein-labeled beta-lactamase mutant (e166cf) as a convenient fluorescent tool to screen beta-lactamases, including the bacillus cereus beta-lactamase i (penpc), b. cereus beta-lactamase  ii, bacillus licheniformis penp, escherichia coli tem-1, and enterobacter cloacae p99 against various beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillin g, penicillin v, ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefoxitin, moxalactam, cephaloridine), using a 96-well microplate reader. the e166cf mutant was constructed by replacing glu166 on the flexible omega-loop, which is close to the enzyme's active site, with a cysteine  residue on a class a beta-lactamase (b. cereus penpc) and subsequently labeling the mutant with thiol-reactive fluorescein-5-maleimide. such modifications significantly impaired the hydrolytic activity of the e166cf mutant compared to that of the wild-type enzyme. the fluorescence intensity of the e166cf mutant increases in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics. for antibiotics that are resistant to hydrolysis by the e166cf mutant (cefuroxime, cefoxitin, moxalactam), the fluorescence signal slowly increases until it reaches a plateau. for antibiotics that can be slowly hydrolyzed by the e166cf mutant (penicillin g, penicillin v, ampicillin), the fluorescence signal rapidly increases to the plateau and then declines after a prolonged incubation. the e166cf mutant retains its characteristic pattern of fluorescence signals in the presence of both bacterial beta-lactamases and beta-lactamase-resistant antibiotics. in contrast,  in the presence of both bacterial beta-lactamases and beta-lactamase-sensitive antibiotics, the fluorescence signals of the e166cf mutant were decreased. the fluorescence signals from the e166cf mutant allow an unambiguous differentiation  of beta-lactamase-resistant antibiotics from beta-lactamase-sensitive ones in the screening of bacterial beta-lactamases against a panel of antibiotic candidates.  this simple method may provide an alternative tool in choosing potent beta-lactam antibiotics for treatment of bacterial infections.

TI  == allophanate hydrolase, not urease, functions in bacterial cyanuric acid metabolism.
AB  == growth substrates containing an s-triazine ring are typically metabolized by bacteria to liberate 3 mol of ammonia via the intermediate cyanuric acid. over a  25-year period, a number of original research papers and reviews have stated that cyanuric acid is metabolized in two steps to the 2-nitrogen intermediate urea. in the present study, allophanate, not urea, was shown to be the 2-nitrogen intermediate in cyanuric acid metabolism in all the bacteria examined. six different experimental results supported this conclusion: (i) synthetic allophanate was shown to readily decarboxylate to form urea under acidic extraction and chromatography conditions used in previous studies; (ii) alkaline  extraction methods were used to stabilize and detect allophanate in bacteria actively metabolizing cyanuric acid; (iii) the kinetic course of allophanate formation and disappearance was consistent with its being an intermediate in cyanuric acid metabolism, and no urea was observed in those experiments; (iv) protein extracts from cells grown on cyanuric acid contained allophanate hydrolase activity; (v) genes encoding the enzymes atze and atzf, which produce and hydrolyze allophanate, respectively, were found in several cyanuric acid-metabolizing bacteria; and (vi) trzf, an atzf homolog found in enterobacter  cloacae strain 99, was cloned, expressed in escherichia coli, and shown to have allophanate hydrolase activity. in addition, we have observed that there are a large number of genes homologous to atzf and trzf distributed in phylogenetically distinct bacteria. in total, the data indicate that s-triazine metabolism in a broad class of bacteria proceeds through allophanate via allophanate hydrolase, rather than through urea using urease.

TI  == enteric fever-like illness caused by infection with citrobacter amalonaticus.
AB  == 'enteric fever' is a potentially fatal, severe systemic disease, which is encountered worldwide. traditionally, enteric fever refers to a bacteremic illness caused by members of certain salmonella serotypes, notably: salmonella typhi, a gram-negative bacterium, and to a lesser extent, salmonella paratyphi a, b and c. in addition, other non-salmonella organisms may produce a syndrome clinically indistinguishable from "enteric fever". brucella sp., campylobacter sp., edwardsiella tarda, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, providencia alcalifaciens, pseudomonas sp., serratia marcescens, francisella sp. and yersinia pp have been identified in enteric fever this is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first case of citrobacter to be reported  presenting as enteric fever in a normal host in thailand.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of cs-023 (ro4908463), a novel parenteral carbapenem.
AB  == cs-023 (ro4908463, formerly r-115685) is a novel 1beta-methylcarbapenem with 5-substituted pyrrolidin-3-ylthio groups, including an amidine moiety at the c-2  position. its antibacterial activity was tested against 1,214 clinical isolates of 32 species and was compared with those of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, amikacin, and levofloxacin. cs-023 exhibited a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and -negative aerobes and anaerobes, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp), beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. cs-023 showed the most potent activity among the compounds tested against p. aeruginosa and mrsa, with mics at  which 90% of isolates tested were inhibited of 4 microg/ml and 8 microg/ml, respectively. cs-023 was stable against hydrolysis by the beta-lactamases from enterobacter cloacae and proteus vulgaris. cs-023 also showed potent activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli. the in vivo  efficacy of cs-023 was evaluated with a murine systemic infection model induced by 13 strains of gram-positive and -negative pathogens and a lung infection model induced by 2 strains of prsp (serotypes 6 and 19). against the systemic infections with prsp, mrsa, and p. aeruginosa and the lung infections, the efficacy of cs-023 was comparable to those of imipenem/cilastatin and vancomycin  (tested against lung infections only) and superior to those of meropenem, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime (tested against p. aeruginosa infections only). these results suggest that cs-023 has potential for the treatment of nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and -negative pathogens, including mrsa and p. aeruginosa.

AB  == aims: to review patients colonised or infected with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae (esblpe) at middlemore hospital, auckland, new zealand. methods: all patients who had an esblpe isolated at the middlemore hospital microbiology laboratory from january 2001 to june 2004 were included in this review. results: esblpe were isolated from 132 patients during the review period. there were 12 patients colonised or infected with an esblpe in 2001, 34 in 2002, 43 in 2003, and 43 in the first 6 months of 2004. the isolates  were escherichia coli (n=56), enterobacter spp. (n=55), and klebsiella pneumoniae (n=21). esblpe were isolated from a wide range of specimens including peripheral  blood in 18 patients. thirty-three (25%) patients had an esblpe isolated within 48 hours of admission; seven of these patients were neither long-term care facility (ltcf) residents nor had hospital admissions in the previous 6 months. thirty-one patients (23%) resided in a ltcf before their admission; four patients from the same ltcf had indistinguishable isolates. all isolates tested were susceptible to meropenem and imipenem. all but one isolate tested was susceptible to ertapenem, and all but two were susceptible to amikacin. conclusions: colonisation and infection due to esblpe are increasing at middlemore hospital and in the auckland community. we expect this trend to continue. there is evidence to suggest transmission of esblpe both in the auckland community and ltcfs. antibiotics useful for treatment of patients with proven esblpe infection  at middlemore hospital include amikacin or a carbapenem. careful infection control practices and antibiotic prescribing will be necessary to reduce the rate of increase of esblpe colonisation and infection at middlemore hospital and in the auckland community.

AB  == the thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose agar (tcbs) used in the most-probable-number method for detecting vibrio parahaemolyticus cannot differentiate growth of v. parahaemolyticus from vibrio vulnificus or vibrio mimicus. this study examined the selectivity and specificity of bio-chrome vibrio medium (bcvm), a chromogenic medium that detects v. parahaemolyticus on the basis of the formation of distinct purple colonies on the medium. a panel consisting of 221 strains of bacteria, including 179 vibrio spp. and 42 non-vibrio spp., were examined for their ability to grow and produce colored colonies on bcvm. growth of salmonella, shigella, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, yersinia enterocolitica, and aeromonas was inhibited by both bcvm and tcbs. all 148 strains of v. parahaemolyticus grew on bcvm, and 145 of them produced purple colonies. the remaining 31 vibrio spp., except one strain of vibrio fluvialis, were either unable to grow or produced blue-green or white colonies on bcvm. bio-chrome vibrio medium was capable of differentiating v. parahaemolyticus from  other species, including v. vulnificus and v. mimicus. further studies are needed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of bcvm for detecting v. parahaemolyticus in foods.

TI  == countrywide spread of community- and hospital-acquired extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ctx-m-15)-producing enterobacteriaceae in lebanon.
AB  == a prospective study was carried out to assess the extent of carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae at both hospital and community levels in lebanon. a total of 1,442 fecal samples were collected from hospital-based patients and 58 from health care workers of six lebanese tertiary care general hospitals located in different areas of lebanon between january and march 2003. a total of 382 fecal samples were also collected  from healthy subjects between april and june 2003. the samples analysis led to the identification of 118 strains as esbl producers based on the synergistic effects between clavulanate and selected beta-lactams (ceftazidime and cefotaxime). these strains were isolated from 72 subjects: 61 patients, 2 health  care workers, and 9 healthy subjects. one representative strain per subject was selected, and a total of 72 nonduplicate esbl producers, including a high majority of escherichia coli (n = 56), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 9), enterobacter cloacae (n = 6), and citrobacter freundii (n = 1), were characterized. the molecular analysis revealed that the majority of the strains (83%) express ctx-m-15 esbl (pi 8.6). shv-5a esbl (pi 8.2) was produced by 18% of the strains. dna macrorestriction analysis of esbl-producing e. coli presented 38 different genotypes, revealing the absence of clonal link among these strains. in addition to the fact that the present study highlights the emergence and the countrywide dissemination of ctx-m-15-producing e. coli in lebanon, it represents the first report of an shv-5a-producing c. freundii.

TI  == extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in yaounde, cameroon.
AB  == organisms producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) have been reported  in many countries, but there is no information on the prevalence of esbl-producing members of the family enterobacteriaceae in cameroon. a total of 259 enterobacteriaceae strains were isolated between 1995 and 1998 from patients  at the yaounde central hospital in cameroon. enterobacterial isolates resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporin and monobactam were screened for esbl production by the double-disk (dd) synergy test. thirty-one (12%) of these enterobacteriaceae strains were shown to be positive by the dd synergy test, suggesting the presence of esbls. resistance to oxyimino-cephalosporins and monobactams of 12 (38.7%) of the 31 strains-i.e., 6 klebsiella pneumoniae, 4 escherichia coli, 1 citrobacter freundii, and 1 enterobacter cloacae strain-was transferred to e. coli hk-225 by conjugation. resistance to gentamicin, gentamicin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was cotransferred into 6, 2, and 1 of these transconjugants, respectively. all 12 transconjugants were resistant to amoxicillin, piperacillin, all of the cephalosporins, and aztreonam but remained susceptible to cefoxitin and imipenem. crude extracts of beta-lactamase-producing transconjugants were able to reduce the diameters of inhibition zones around disks containing penicillins, narrow- to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins or monobactams when tested against a fully susceptible e. coli strain but had no effect on such zones around cefoxitin, imipenem, and amoxicillin-clavulanate disks. the beta-lactamases produced by the  12 tranconjugants turned out to be shv-12 by dna sequencing. therefore, the esbl  shv-12 is described for the first time in cameroon.

AB  == tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from april 2003 to march 2004 were investigated in a multicenter study in  japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 455 strains including 14 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 191(75.2%) of 254 patients with surgical infections. two hundred and thirty-nine strains were isolated from primary infections, and 216 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-positive bacteria and aerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, while aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-positive bacteria, such as enterococcus spp. and staphylococcus aureus were higher from both types of infections. among anaerobic  gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, e. coli was the most predominantly isolated, followed by p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae, and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. the isolation rate  of anaerobic gram-positive bacteria from primary infections and that of aerobic gram-positive bacteria from postoperative infections were high in the last several years. in this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci, but a few strains of moderately arbekacin-resistant mrsa. carbapenm-resistant p. aeruginosa was seen in less than 10 per cents. last year we noticed that there were cefazolin-resistant e. coli producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase, but there was no highly cefazolin-resistant e. coli in this year. in the next series, increase of both anaerobic bacteria and enterococcus spp. should be carefully followed up.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin under various conditions against standard strains, beta-lactam resistant strains, and multidrug efflux system mutants].
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the possible benefit of fosfomycin (fom) as prophylactic antibiotic in terms of antimicrobial activity and the potential of inducibility of beta-lactamase, compared with cefazolin, cefotiam, cefmetazole, and piperacillin that are commonly used as perioperative agents. the in vitro activity of fom against aerobic gram-negative bacteria using mueller-hinton agar or nutrient agar supplemented with glucose-6-phosphate (g6p)  as tested medium increased within a range from 2 to 256 times the activity in the medium without g6p. however, the susceptibility of gram-positive bacteria to fom  remained largely unchanged with or without g6p. there was no aerobic- or anaerobic-bacteria which changed susceptibility against beta-lactam antibiotics under various tested medium conditions. fom demonstrated strong bactericidal activity against escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa in a dose dependent  manner, and decreased viable cell counts of staphylococcus aureus. in the case of p. aeruginosa, transmission electron micrographs study revealed that numerous lysed cells were present 2 hours after treatment with fom at four times the mic.  first and second generation cephalosporins induced ampc-type beta-lactamase in a  dose dependent manner among beta-lactamase inducible strains of p. aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae. on the other hand, inducible activity of fom on beta-lactamase production was less than 1/25 to 1/65 compared with those of cephalosporins. in addition, fom maintained strong antimicrobial activity for over then 20 years after marketing, because of the excellent stability against various types of beta-lactamase produced by plasmid-carrying bacteria and clinical isolates. fom was not extruded by four types of efflux systems, such as  mexab-oprm, mexcd-oprj, mexxy/ oprm and mexef-oprn, however beta-lactam antibiotics were substrates of mexab-oprm and mexcd-oprj. in conclusion, fom provides adequate coverage for both aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria causing postoperative infections. further, fom would not select/concentrate beta-lactamase producing bacteria in the clinical fields and would not be a substrate for multidrug efflux system of p. aeruginosa.

TI  == worldwide disseminated arma aminoglycoside resistance methylase gene is borne by  composite transposon tn1548.
AB  == the arma (aminoglycoside resistance methylase) gene, which confers resistance to  4,6-disubstituted deoxystreptamines and fortimicin, was initially found in klebsiella pneumoniae bm4536 on incl/m plasmid pip1204 of ca. 90 kb which also encodes the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase ctx-m-3. thirty-four enterobacteria  from various countries that were likely to produce a ctx-m enzyme since they were more resistant to cefotaxime than to ceftazidime were studied. the arma gene was  detected in 12 clinical isolates of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, and shigella flexneri, in which it was always associated with bla(ctx-m-3) on an incl/m plasmid. conjugation, analysis of dna sequences, pcr mapping, and plasmid conduction experiments indicated that the arma gene was part of composite transposon tn1548  together with genes ant3"9, sul1, and dfrxii, which are responsible for resistance to streptomycin-spectinomycin, sulfonamides, and trimethoprim, respectively. the 16.6-kb genetic element was flanked by two copies of is6 and migrated by replicative transposition. this observation accounts for the presence of arma on self-transferable plasmids of various incompatibility groups and its worldwide dissemination. it thus appears that posttranscriptional modification of 16s rrna confers high-level resistance to all the clinically available aminoglycosides except streptomycin in gram-negative human and animal pathogens.

"mdr-gnb isolates" were defined as pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, and klebsiella species isolates with resistance to at least 3 antimicrobial groups. a case-control study was performed to determine the independent risk factors for harboring mdr-gnb at hospital admission. results: between 1998 and 2003, the prevalence of mdr-gnb isolates recovered from patients at hospital admission increased significantly for all isolate species (p < .001), with the exception of p. aeruginosa (p = .09). of 464 mdr-gnb isolates, 12%, 35%, and 53% of isolates were coresistant to 5, 4, and 3 antimicrobial groups, respectively. multivariable analysis identified age > or = 65 years (odds ratio [or], 2.8; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.1-7.4; p < .04), prior exposure to antibiotics for > or = 14 days (or, 8.7; 95% ci, 2.5 -30; p < .001), and prior residence in a long-term care facility (or, 3.5; 95% ci, 1.3-9.4; p < .01) as independent risk factors for harboring mdr-gnb at hospital admission. conclusion: a substantial number of patients harbor mdr-gnb at hospital admission. identification of common coresistance patterns among mdr-gnb isolates may assist  in the selection of empirical antimicrobial therapy for patients with a high risk of harboring mdr-gnb.

TI  == analysis of etiology and drug resistance of biliary infections.
AB  == the bile was collected from fro patients with biliary infections, with the bacterium isolated to study the sensitivity of each kind of the bacterium to several antibiotics in common use. except g- bacterium, we also found some kinds  of g+ bacterium in infection bile. g- bacterium were not sensitive to clindamycin, g+ bacterium were sensitive to ciprofloxacin. escherichia coli, xanthomonas maltophilia, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ampicillin. g+ bacterium were not sensitive to azactam. enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterobacter cloacae were not sensitive to ceftazidime. enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus coagulase negative, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa were not sensitive to ceftriaxone sodium. we didn't found any bacterium resistance imipenem. the possibility of the existence of g+ bacterium as well as drug resistance should be considered n patients with biliary infections. the value of susceptibility test should be respected to avoid drug abuse of antibiotics.

TI  == variety of tem-, shv-, and ctx-m-type beta-lactamases present in recent clinical  isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae from taiwan.
AB  == a total of 171 hospitals' isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of > or =2 microg/ml for ceftazidime or  cefotaxime were evaluated for the production of beta-lactamases. pcr amplification with specific primers for the bla (shv), bla (tem), and bla (ctx) genes revealed that a total of 53, 81, and 43 of these genes were amplified, respectively. sequencing results confirmed that tem-1, ctx-m-3 and -14, shv-1, -5, -11, -12, and -33, oxy-1a, and len-1 were presented among these isolates. no  specific large cluster of isolates carried the same beta-lactamases, indicating the wide diversity of the collected strains. plasmid spread between e. coli and k. pneumoniae was identified in few isolates. combinations of tem, shv, and ctx beta-lactamase genes, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes, were observed in all three species.

TI  == in vitro activity of levofloxacin against recent gram-negative nosocomial pathogens.
AB  == the objective of our study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of levofloxacin  in comparison with other antibiotics (coamoxiclav, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, meropenem, aztreonam, ciprofloxacin and netilmicin) against about 500 gram-negative nosocomial microorganisms, isolated during 2003. the bactericidal activities (minimal bactericidal activity and killing curve) of levofloxacin and  the other antibiotics were also evaluated. the results confirm the excellent in vitro activity of levofloxacin against multiresistant nosocomial gram-negative pathogens, including the 73 extended spectrum beta-lactamase producer strains (90% of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae were inhibited at 0.5 mg/l). of particular interest is its susceptibility and bactericidal activity against stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains. in conclusion, due to the favorable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the molecule, associated with its safety, levofloxacin may represent a valid therapeutic option in the treatment of severe gram-negative nosocomial infections.

TI  == interactions of escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes plants cultivated in a gnotobiotic system.
AB  == the growth and persistence of escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes on a diverse range of plant types over extended cultivation periods was studied. when introduced on the seed of carrot, cress, lettuce, radish, spinach and tomato all the pathogens became rapidly established  shortly after germination, attaining cell densities of the order of 5.5-6.5 log cfu/g. in general, es. coli o157:h7 and l. monocytogenes became established and persisted at significantly higher levels on seedlings (9 days post-germination) than salmonella. es. coli o157:h7 became internalized in cress, lettuce, radish and spinach seedlings but was not recovered within the tissues of mature plants.  internalization of salmonella was also observed in lettuce and radish but not cress or spinach seedlings. in contrast, l. monocytogenes did not internalize within seedlings but did persist on the surface of plants throughout the cultivation period. co-inoculation of isolates recovered from the rhizosphere of  plants did not significantly affect the numbers or persistence of human pathogens. the only exception was with enterobacter cloacae, which reduced es. coli o157:h7 ph1 and l. monocytogenes levels by ca. 1 log cfu/g on lettuce. with  the bioluminescent phenotype of es. coli o157:h7 ph1, it was demonstrated that the human pathogen became established on the roots of growing plants. scanning electron micrographs of root seedlings suggested that es. coli o157:h7 ph1 preferentially colonized the root junctions of seedlings. it is proposed that such colonization sites enhanced the persistence of es. coli o157:h7 on plants and facilitated internalization within developing seedlings. the results suggest  that the risk associated with internalized human pathogens in salad vegetables at harvest is low. nevertheless, the introduction of human pathogens at an early stage of plant development could enhance their persistence in the rhizosphere. the implications of the study with regards to on-farm food safety initiatives are discussed.

TI  == [distribution and drug-resistance of 3 500 gram-negative bacteria in guangzhou].
AB  == objective: to investigate the distribution and drug-resistance of the common gram-negative bacteria in guangzhou. methods: from july 2001 to august 2003, the  resistance of 3 500 strains of common gram-negative bacteria isolated from 13 hospitals in guangzhou to 15 to 21 antibiotics was determined by standard kirby-bauer method according to the guidelines of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls, 2000). whonet-5 software was used to analyze the data. results: totally 3 500 gram-negative bacterial strains were isolated from 13 hospitals in guangzhou in the past two years, and the top 3 most common pathogens of them were escherichia coli (1 244 strains, 35.5%), klebsiella pneumoniae (900 strains, 25.7%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (547 strains, 15.6 %). the total prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls)-producing strains was 31.0% (1 084/3 500). the prevalences of esbls-producing strains in the escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter sp., other enterobacter sp., stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and proteus sp. in guangzhou were 38.7%, 37.9%, 5.3%, 55.2%, 8.2%, 27.7%, 33.3% and 9.2%, respectively. among them, 1 463 (41.8%) strains was isolated from the respiratory tract and 943 (26.9%) from the urinary tract. according to our surveillance, the clinical antibacterial drug with the lowest total drug-resistance rates of gram-negative bacteria was imipenem (8.7%) followed by cefoperazone/sulbactam (13.3%), while that with the highest resistance was ampicillin (90.9%) followed by nalidixic acid (69.3%). imipenem was the most effective agents against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter sp., other enterobacter sp., and proteus sp. isolated from 13 hospitals in guangzhou, with drug-resistant rates of 1.1%, 0.5%, 0.6%, 3.2%, 0.8% and 0%, respectively, whereas the most effective agents against pseudomonas  aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia was cefoperazone/sulbactam, with the  drug-resistance rates of 10.8% and 15.9%, respectively. most of the isolates were multi-drug resistant. the resistance rates of esbls-producing strains to 15 to 21 antimicrobial agents were much higher than those of non-esbls-producing strains (p<0.05). conclusions: drug resistance of the clinical isolates is a serious problem in guangzhou, and the increasing prevalence of esbls-producing strains of other bacteria should be given full attention. an unanimous and effective strategy for controlling this problem is urgently needed. imipenem and cefoperazone/sulbactam are the most effective antibiotics against the gram-negative bacteria isolated from the 13 hospitals in guangzhou.

TI  == isolation of gram-negative bacteria from cockroaches trapped from urban environment.
AB  == three different areas--hospital, food-handling establishments and human dwellings, were surveyed for pathogenic gram-negative bacteria carried on the cuticles of cockroaches. fifty species of bacteria were identified from all cockroaches. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae were the most frequently found. pathogenic and potentially pathogenic bacteria represented 58% of all bacteria identified. the numbers of pathogenic and potentially pathogenic bacteria were similar in hospital areas and food-handling establishments, while, human dwellings possessed a poorer bacterial flora. e. coli, k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae were dominant species in hospital areas, while in food-handling establishments and human dwellings, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and c. freundii predominated. therefore, cockroaches can play a role in bacterial transmission, due to the bacteria carried on their cuticles.

TI  == structure-activity relationship of 6-methylidene penems bearing tricyclic heterocycles as broad-spectrum beta-lactamase inhibitors: crystallographic structures show unexpected binding of 1,4-thiazepine intermediates.
AB  == the design and synthesis of a series of seven tricyclic 6-methylidene penems as novel class a and c serine beta-lactamase inhibitors is described. these compounds proved to be very potent inhibitors of the tem-1 and ampc beta-lactamases and less so against the class b metallo-beta-lactamase ccra. in combination with piperacillin, their in vitro activities enhanced susceptibility  of all class c resistant strains from various bacteria. crystallographic structures of a serine-bound reaction intermediate of 17 with the class a shv-1 and class c gc1 enzymes have been established to resolutions of 2.0 and 1.4 a, respectively, and refined to r-factors equal 0.163 and 0.145. in both beta-lactamases, a seven-membered 1,4-thiazepine ring has formed. the stereogenic c7 atom in the ring has the r configuration in the shv-1 intermediate and has both r and s configurations in the gc1 intermediate. hydrophobic stacking interactions between the tricyclic c7 substituent and a tyrosine side chain, rather than electrostatic or hydrogen bonding by the c3 carboxylic acid group, dominate in both complexes. the formation of the 1,4- thiazepine ring structures  is proposed based on a 7-endo-trig cyclization.

TI  == an antimicrobial peptide from the skin secretions of the mountain chicken frog leptodactylus fallax (anura:leptodactylidae).
AB  == a 25 amino-acid-residue, c-terminally alpha-amidated peptide with antimicrobial activity, which has been termed fallaxin, was isolated in high yield from the norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the mountain chicken frog leptodactylus fallax (anura:leptodactylidae). the amino acid sequence of the peptide (gly-val-val-asp-ile-leu-lys-gly-ala-ala-lys-asp-ile-ala-gly-his-leu-ala-ser-lys- val-met-asn-lys-leu.nh2) shows structural similarity with members of the ranatuerin-2 family previously isolated from the skins of frogs of the genus rana that are only distantly related to the leptodactylidae. this observation is consistent with the hypothesis that many frog skin antimicrobial peptides are related evolutionarily, having arisen from multiple duplications of an ancestral  gene that existed before the radiation of the different families. fallaxin inhibited the growth of reference strains of gram-negative bacteria (escherichia  coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae) but with relatively low potency (mic> or =20 microm) and was inactive against the gram-positive bacterium (staphylococcus aureus) and the yeast candida albicans. the hemolytic activity of fallaxin was very low (hc50>200 microm). a second peptide, comprising residues (1-22) of fallaxin, was also isolated from the skin  secretions but this component was inactive against the microorganisms tested.

TI  == shiga toxin-encoding bacteriophages--genomes in motion.
AB  == shiga toxins (stx) represent a group of bacterial toxins that are involved in human and animal disease. stx are mainly produced by escherichia coli isolated from human and non-human sources, shigella dysenteriae type 1, and sporadically,  by citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and shigella flexneri. the genes encoding stx are encoded in the genome of heterogeneous lambdoid prophages (stx-converting bacteriophages; stx-phages). they are located in a similar position in the late region of the prophage genome and stx is under control of phage genes. therefore, induction of stx-converting prophages triggers increased  production of stx. following induction, stx-phages can infect other bacteria in vivo and in vitro. stx-phages may be considered to represent highly mobile genetic elements that play an important role in the expression of stx, in horizontal gene transfer, and hence in genome diversification.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16srdna oligonucleotide array].
AB  == objective: the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. however conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological  assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. on the basis of special gene sequence, pcr provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. but it is  difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic  agents. oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of  target genes. the objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the pcr product of 16srdna using a pair of universal  primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. methods: by comparison and analysis of the 16srdna sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. a pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight  species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. the probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of pcr  using the universal primers. results: the universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, neisseria meningitides, citrobacter freundii, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human dna as control. the results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could  not hybridize with other bacteria. the lowest concentration of dna (product of pcr) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. the results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. the results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. from the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common  infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. conclusions: despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system,  which contains amplification of the segment of 16rdna from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of pcr products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.

AB  == degenerate primers were designed from the conserved zone of hyda structural gene  encoding for catalytic subunit of [fe]-hydrogenase of different hydrogen producing bacteria. a 750 bp of pcr product was amplified by using the above-mentioned degenerate primers and genomic dna of enterobacter cloacae iit-bt 08 as template. the amplified pcr product was cloned and sequenced. the sequence  showed the presence of an orf of 450 bp with significant similarity (40%) with c-terminal end of the conserved zone (h-cluster) of [fe]- hydrogenase. hyda orf was then amplified and cloned in-frame with gst in pgex4t-1 and overexpressed in  a non-hydrogen producing escherichia coli bl-21 to produce a gst-fusion protein of a calculated molecular mass of about 42.1 kda. recombinant protein was purified and specifically recognized by anti-gst monoclonal antibody through western blot. southern hybridization confirmed the presence of this gene in e. cloacae iit-bt 08 genome. in vitro hydrogenase assay with the overexpressed hydrogenase enzyme showed that it is catalytically active upon anaerobic adaptation. in vivo hydrogenase assay confirmed the presence of h2 gas in the gas mixture obtained from the batch culture of recombinant e. coli bl-21. a tentative molecular mechanism has been proposed about the transfer of electron from electron donor to h-cluster without the mediation of the f-cluster.

TI  == evaluation of the microscan esbl plus confirmation panel for detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == objective: we aimed to assess the performance of the microscan esbl plus confirmation panel using a series of 87 oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacilli of various species. methods: organisms tested included 57 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) strains comprising enterobacter aerogenes (3), enterobacter cloacae (10), escherichia coli (11), klebsiella pneumoniae (26), klebsiella oxytoca (3) and proteus mirabilis (4). also included were 30 strains resistant to oxyimino cephalosporins but lacking esbls, which were characterized with other resistance mechanisms, such as inherent clavulanate susceptibility in acinetobacter spp. (4), hyperproduction of ampc enzyme in citrobacter freundii (2), e. aerogenes (3), e. cloacae (3), e. coli (4), hafnia alvei (1) and morganella morganii (1), production of plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase in k. pneumoniae (3) and e. coli (3) or hyperproduction of k1 enzyme in k. oxytoca (6). results: the microscan mic-based clavulanate synergy correctly classified 50 of 57 esbl strains as esbl-positive and 23 of 30 non-esbl strains as esbl-negative (yielding a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 76.7%, respectively). false negatives among esbl producers were highest with enterobacter spp. due to masking interactions between esbl and ampc beta-lactamases. false-positive classifications occurred in two acinetobacter spp., one e. coli producing plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase and two k. oxytoca hyperproducing their chromosomal k1 beta-lactamase. conclusion: the microscan clavulanate synergy test proved to be a valuable tool for esbl confirmation. however, this test has limitations in detecting esbls in enterobacter spp. and in discriminating esbl-related resistance from the k1 enzyme and from inherent clavulanate susceptibility in acinetobacter spp.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == newer carbapenems for urinary tract infections.
AB  == four carbapenems have been available clinically in japan. these are imipenem/cilastatin (imip/cs) and panipenem/ betamipron (pani/bp) of the older compounds and newer carbapenems such as biapem (biap) and meropenem (mero). the latter compounds are relatively stable to dehydropeptidase-1 (dhp-1) and have been reported to have higher antimicrobial activities compared to the earlier carbapenems. the antimicrobial activity of these four carbapenems against fresh urinary isolates showed high activities against enterobacteriacae such as serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and escherichia coli containing the class c-beta-lactamase- and extended spectrum beta-lactamase  (esbl)-producing strains compared to piperacillin (pipc) and ceftazidime (ctaz).  against pseudomonas aeruginosa, the carbapenems, with the exception of panipenem  showed strong antimicrobial activities compared to pipc and ctaz. high activities were also seen against enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, but methicillin-resistant strains were not affected.  the first generation carbapenems showed better activity against e. faecalis than  newer carbapenems. all four carbapenems were similar in clinical effectiveness in double blind trials for complicated urinary tract infections (utis). however, pani/bp is less effective in utis caused by p. aeruginosa than imip/cs. mero showed better eradication rate of p. aeruginosa than imip/cs. retrospective analysis of treated cases using carbapenems showed a rapid defervescence in the treatment of febrile complicated utis, which were mainly caused by mixed infection of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, especially those involving p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis.

TI  == gram-positive mera gene in gram-negative oral and urine bacteria.
AB  == clinical mercury resistant (hg(r)) gram-negative bacteria carrying gram-positive  mercury reductase (mera)-like genes were characterized using dna-dna hybridization, pcr and sequencing. a pcr assay was developed which discriminated  between the mera genes related to staphylococcus and those related to the bacillus/streptococcus mera genes by the difference in size of the pcr product. dna sequence analysis correlated with the pcr assay. the mera genes from acinetobacter junii, enterobacter cloacae and escherichia coli were sequenced and shared 98-99% identical nucleotide (nt) and 99.6-100% amino acid identity with the staphylococcus aureus mera protein. a fourth mera gene, from pantoeae agglomerans, was partially sequenced (60%) and had 99% identical nt and 100% amino acid identity with the streptococcus oralis mera protein. all the hg(r) gram-negative bacteria transferred their gram-positive mera genes to a gram-positive enterococcus faecalis recipient with the resulting transconjugants  expressing mercury resistance. these gram-positive mera genes join gram-positive  tetracycline resistance and gram-positive macrolide resistance genes in their association with mobile elements which are able to transfer and express in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == evaluation of the purification capacity of nine portable, small-scale water purification devices.
AB  == a test was performed to evaluate the microbial and chemical purification capacity of nine portable, small-scale water purification filter devices with production capacity less than 100 l/h. the devices were tested for simultaneous removal capacity of bacteria (cultured escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae), enteric protozoans (formalin-stored cryptosporidium parvum oocysts), viral markers (f-rna bacteriophages) and microcystins produced by toxic cyanobacterial cultures. in general, the devices tested were able to remove bacterial contaminants by 3.6-6.9 log10 units from raw water. those devices based only on filtration through pores  0.2-0.4 microm or larger failed in viral and chemical purification. only one device, based on reverse osmosis, was capable of removing f-rna phages at concentrations under the detection limit and microcystins by 2.5 log10. the present study emphasised the need for evaluation tests of water purification devices from the public safety and haccp (hazard analysis and critical control point) points of view. simultaneous testing for various pathogenic/indicator microbes and microcystins was shown to be a useful and practical way to obtain essential data on actual purification capacity of commercial small-scale drinking-water filters.

TI  == trends and antimicrobial resistance of pathogens causing bloodstream infections among febrile neutropenic adults with hematological malignancy.
AB  == background and purpose: the microbiological spectrum in cancer patients with febrile neutropenia has changed over the past several decades in western countries. the growing incidence of antimicrobial resistance is an inevitable consequence of the widespread use of antibiotics in medical settings. the aim of  this study was to clarify the trends and antimicrobial resistance among pathogens causing bloodstream infections in febrile neutropenic adults with hematological malignancies. methods: the characteristics of pathogens causing bloodstream infection isolated from patients with febrile neutropenia who were treated at national taiwan university hospital from 1996 to 2001 were reviewed. a total of 1174 pathogens were isolated from 3093 admissions to a hematological ward during  this period. among them, 738 isolates were recovered from patients with febrile neutropenia. results: the majority (93%) of these neutropenic febrile patients had underlying acute leukemia or lymphoma. gram-negative bacteria accounted for 57% of isolated pathogens, followed by gram-positive bacteria (32%), fungi (7%),  and anaerobes (3%). in decreasing frequency, escherichia coli (13%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12%), enterobacter cloacae (7%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%), and acinetobacter baumannii (5%) were the predominant gram-negative bacteria, while coagulase-negative staphylococci (13%), viridans group streptococci (4%), and staphylococcus aureus (4%) were the major gram-positive pathogens. two-thirds (20/30) of s. aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. no vancomycin-resistant enterococci were isolated. resistance to cefotaxime was found in 63% of e. cloacae, 13% of k. pneumoniae and 10% of e. coli. overall, 33% of e. coli and 13% of k. pneumoniae were resistant to ciprofloxacin. conclusions: this study indicates that the microbiological spectrum of microorganisms causing  bloodstream infections in neutropenic febrile patients with hematological malignancies at national taiwan university hospital is different from western countries in that gram-negative bacteria remain the predominant pathogens. antimicrobial resistance among these pathogens is high and e. coli and k. pneumoniae isolates with resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin are increasing.

TI  == transcriptional analysis of the acid-inducible asr gene in enterobacteria.
AB  == we show here that transcription of the asr gene in escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae is strongly dependent on the acidification level of the growth medium, with maximal  induction at ph 4.0-4.5 as determined by northern hybridization analysis. previous gene array analyses have also shown that asr is the most acid-induced gene in the e. coli genome. sequence alignment of the asr promoters from different enterobacterial species identified a highly conserved region located at position -70 to -30 relative to the asr transcriptional start site. by deletion of various segments of this region in the e. coli asr promoter it was shown that  sequences upstream from the -40 position were important for induction. transcription from the e. coli asr promoter was demonstrated to be growth-phase-dependent and to require the alternative sigma factor rpos (sigma(s)) in stationary phase. transcription of the asr gene was also found to be subject to negative control by the nucleoid protein h-ns.

TI  == [epidemiology and drug resistance of the pathogenic microbes in the complicated infection of hematological malignancies].
AB  == objective: to investigate the epidemiological characteristics and drug resistance profile of the infection in patients with hematological malignancies. methods: all the microbe strains isolated from the department of hematology in ruijin hospital between 1998 and 2002 were collected for the assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility and the results were analysed by whonet5 software. results: out of the 536 strains isolated in the department of hematology, 230 (42.9%) were gram positive and 301 (56.2%) gram negative organisms. the first 6 strains of gram (-) microbes in frequent order were pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii and stenotrophomonas (xantho) maltophi. the extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbls)  producing rates of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were 27.3% and 33.3%, respectively. methylcillin resistant coagulase negative staphylococcus (mrcns) was the most prevalent gram (+) bacteria in the complicated infection patients with hematological malignancies, which accounted for 88.5%. carbapenems  were most sensitive for all of the gram negative bacteria, with a drug resistance rate of 11.4 (5.0% approximately 15.8%) of imipenem. for esbls strains, carbapenems and cefapime were the best choice, with the resistance rate of 46.4%  approximately 94.4% and 50.0% approximately 75.9%, respectively. the drug resistance rate of acinetobacter baumannii was 25.0% approximately 41.3% for the  third generation cephalosporin, 22.7% for the fourth generation cephalosporin and 12.7% for imipenem. pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant to carbapenems, with a resistance rate of 12.7% of imipenem; however, it was more sensitive to the third generation cephalosporin. conclusion: antibiotics should be rationally administrated with more considerations to the characteristics of epidemiology and drug resistance profile of the microbes in the given department of hematology.

TI  == use of dna microarrays for rapid genotyping of tem beta-lactamases that confer resistance.
AB  == standard clinical procedures for pathogen resistance identification are laborious and usually require 2 days of cultivation before the resistance can be determined unequivocally. in contrast, clinicians and patients face increasing threats from  antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria in terms of their frequencies and levels of resistance. a major class of microbial resistance stems from the occurrence of beta-lactamases, which, if mutated, can cause the severe extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) or inhibitor-resistant tem (irt) phenotype, which cause resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, monobactams, and beta-lactamase inhibitors. we describe an oligonucleotide microarray for identification of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) of 96% of the tem beta-lactamase variants  described to date which are related to the esbl and/or irt phenotype. the target  dna, originating from escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, and klebsiella pneumoniae cells isolated from clinical samples, was amplified and fluorescently  labeled by pcr with consensus primers in the presence of cyanine 5-labeled nucleotides. the total assay, including pcr, hybridization, and image analysis, could be performed in 3.5 h. the microarray results were validated by standard clinical procedures. the microarray outperformed the standard procedures in terms of assay time and the depth of information provided. in conclusion, this array offers an attractive option for the identification and epidemiologic monitoring of tem beta-lactamases in the routine clinical diagnostic laboratory.

AB  == we sought to characterize the molecular epidemiology of gram-negative bacilli (gnb) causing infections in infants and associated with carriage on nurses' hands after hand hygiene was performed. from march 2001 to january 2003, gnb caused 192 (34%) of 562 hospital-acquired infections in the 2 participating neonatal intensive care units (nicus) and were isolated from the hands of 45 (38%) of 119  nurses. five species--klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens and enterobacter cloacae, all of which were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis--caused 169 (88%) of 192 of gnb infections. overall, 58% of infections were caused by unique strains not cultured from other  infants or nurses, and 31% of infections were part of unrecognized molecular clusters. in contrast, only 9% of strains that caused infections were cultured from nurses' hands. these data suggest that practices in addition to hand hygiene are needed to prevent horizontal transmission of gnb in the nicu.

TI  == resistance rates to commonly used antimicrobials among pathogens of both bacteremic and non-bacteremic community-acquired urinary tract infection.
AB  == this study examined the distribution of organisms and their antimicrobial resistance in patients admitted due to acute bacteremic and non-bacteremic community-acquired urinary tract infection (uti). during a period of 1 year and 1 month, a total of 201 patients and 253 bacterial isolates were studied. fever higher than 38.5 degrees c was significantly more common in the bacteremic group  than the non-bacteremic group (68% vs 48%; p<0.05). escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis were the most common organisms isolated. e. coli was the leading pathogen and it was significantly more predominant in bacteremic uti than non-bacteremic uti (73% vs 49%; p<0.01).  bacteria other than e. coli (i.e., k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, proteus spp., morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter spp., acinetobacter baumannii, serratia marcescens, and providencia spp.) were more common in non-bacteremic uti than bacteremic uti (44% vs 22%; p<0.01). e. coli isolated from both bacteremic and non-bacteremic patients had a high rate of resistance to ampicillin (80%), cephalothin (59%), gentamicin (29%), piperacillin (61%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (56%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (34%), and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid (36%). isolates of p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and  proteus spp. from the non-bacteremic group showed a higher proportion of resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, aminoglycosides (netilmicin and amikacin) and ciprofloxacin. the emergence of a high rate of resistance to commonly used antimicrobials (ampicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, piperacillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid) may have an impact on the antibiotic treatment of patients admitted due to acute community-acquired bacteremic or non-bacteremic uti in taiwan. further studies are needed to clarify the impact of antimicrobial  resistance on the outcome in these conditions.

TI  == evaluation of the uro-quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

AB  == several independent studies of bacterial degradation of nitrate ester explosives  have demonstrated the involvement of flavin-dependent oxidoreductases related to  the old yellow enzyme (oye) of yeast. some of these enzymes also transform the nitroaromatic explosive 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (tnt). in this work, catalytic capabilities of five members of the oye family were compared, with a view to correlating structure and function. the activity profiles of the five enzymes differed substantially; no one compound proved to be a good substrate for all five enzymes. tnt is reduced, albeit slowly, by all five enzymes. the nature of the transformation products differed, with three of the five enzymes yielding products indicative of reduction of the aromatic ring. our findings suggest two distinct pathways of tnt transformation, with the initial reduction of tnt being  the key point of difference between the enzymes. characterization of an active site mutant of one of the enzymes suggests a structural basis for this difference.

TI  == enteric gram-negative bacilli bloodstream infections: 17 years' experience in a neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  == objective: to assess the occurrence of enteric gram-negative bacilli (egnb) bloodstream infections (bsi) in a neonatal intensive care setting during a 17-year period in which a consistent antibiotic treatment program was in place. to document infections, outbreaks, or epidemics, emergence of antibiotic resistance, clinical correlates, and outcomes of the most prevalent egnb (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae). methods: this study analyzed demographic, clinical, and bacteriologic information from 360 infants born 1986-2002 who developed 633 blood culture-proven bsi. a total of 121 egnb were isolated (e coli, k pneumoniae, and e cloacae). early-onset bsi were discovered within 48 hours from birth, and late-onset bsi were those that occurred thereafter. suspected early-onset bsi were treated with ampicillin and gentamicin, suspected late-onset bsi with vancomycin and gentamicin. antibiotics  were changed on the basis of organism antimicrobial susceptibility. results: early-onset bsi were noted in 52 of 21,336 (244/100,000) live births (1986-1991), 40 of 20,402 (196/100,000) live births (1992-1997), and 25 of 17,926 (139/100,000) live births (1998-2002). of these cases, 39 were caused by e coli and 4 by k pneumoniae. antibiograms for e coli isolated during the last 5 years of the study showed an increase in antibiotic resistance that coincided with obstetric group b streptococcus antepartum antibiotic prophylaxis. group b streptococcus declined from 41 to 4 cases from the first to the last period. late-onset bsi increased from 111 to 230 cases from the first to the second 6-year study period and declined modestly (171 cases) during the last. fifteen percent (78 cases) of late-onset bsi were caused by egnb, 5% by other gram-negative bacilli, 67% primarily by coagulase-negative staphylococcus, and 13% by fungus. nonspecific clinical and hematologic signs of late-onset bsi were  similar across egnb species, but necrotizing enterocolitis was often associated with e coli, whereas pneumonia and prolonged thrombocytopenia characterized k pneumoniae infections. no outbreaks or epidemics were observed, and strains of egnb with evidence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase production were never isolated. conclusion: antepartum antibiotic prophylaxis may have increased antibiotic resistance in e coli isolates from early-onset bsi but has dramatically decreased group b streptococcus infections. late-onset bsi caused by egnb increased, but without changes in antibiotic susceptibility. in spite of medical advances, e coli, k pneumoniae, and e cloacae remain responsible for significant morbidity and mortality, especially in very low birth weight infants.

AB  == bact-alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. first argentine multicentre study. between january and december 2001, we analyzed 80,141 blood cultures by the bact-alert system (14,960 fan aerobics, 3,855 fan anaerobic, 11,114 standards aerobics, 11,367 standards anaerobic, 12,054 pediatrics and 26,791 fan pediatrics bottles) and 44.235 series from 27.615 patients at eight hospitals of buenos aires city, one of la plata city and three  of the buenos aires province. a total of 13,657 blood cultures yielded a positive result. only 181 of them had been detected as positive between the 5th and 7th day of incubation and only 26 (0.19%) had clinical significance (staphylococcus aureus 3; coagulase negative staphylococci 2; enterococcus faecalis 1; streptococcus pneumoniae 2; campylobacter spp 1; escherichia coli 1; enterobacter cloacae 1; enterobacteraerogenes 1; citrobacter freundii 1; klebsiella pneumoniae 1; proteus mirabilis 1; serratia marcescens 4; yeasts 7, including one strain of  cryptococcus neoformans). of the total of contaminants, 38% were isolated by the  anaerobic standard (65% were propionibacterium spp and 29% coagulase negative staphylococci), 31.2% by the fan aerobic (33.3% difphteroids and 28.9% bacillus spp), 11.8% by the pediatric, 9% by fan pediatric, 8.33% by aerobic standard and  1.4% by fan anaerobic bottle. our results show that the prolonged incubation of blood cultures for more than 5 days using the bact-alert system is unnecessary.

TI  == eight gram-negative bacteria are 10,000 times more sensitive to cationic detergents than to anionic detergents.
AB  == in liquid culture, eight typical gram-negative bacteria were ca. 10,000-fold more sensitive to cationic detergents than to the anionic detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate. cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (ctab) was inhibitory at concentrations ranging from 0.0006% to 0.01%. four pseudomonads able to form biofilms were ca. 1000-fold more resistant to ctab on luria-bertani agar plates than they were in liquid culture. a lasi mutant of pseudomonas aeruginosa was only able to tolerate 0.1% ctab on luria-bertani agar plates but could tolerate 5% ctab when supplemented with homoserine lactone containing culture supernatants.

TI  == evaluation of a new cefepime-clavulanate esbl etest to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in an enterobacteriaceae strain collection.
AB  == objectives: in this study, we evaluated the performance of a new esbl etest configuration based on clavulanate synergy with cefepime compared with cefotaxime-clavulanate and ceftazidime-clavulanate esbl etest strips for the detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) in an enterobacteriaceae strain collection, with special focus on enterobacter spp. methods: overall, a total of 54 clinical isolates of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae species were evaluated: enterobacter aerogenes (n=3), enterobacter cloacae (n=10), escherichia coli (n=10), klebsiella oxytoca (n=3), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=25) and proteus mirabilis (n=3). to check etest behaviour with resistance phenotypes similar to esbl, our panel was expanded by six clinical isolates of k. oxytoca that were identified as putative producers of their chromosomal k1 beta-lactamase. results: with this panel, esbl etest was 98% sensitive with cefepime-clavulanate, 83% with cefotaxime-clavulanate, and 74% with ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. concentrating on enterobacter spp., reliable esbl detection could only be achieved by the new cefepime-clavulanate strip since it confirmed esbl production in all strains (100% sensitivity) whereas only 4/13 (31%) of enterobacter strains were positive using cefotaxime-clavulanate or ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. a limitation of using the new cefepime strip was less than optimal specificity with k1 phenotypes of k. oxytoca: among six strains, four isolates were scored false-positive by etest strips containing cefepime-clavulanate. conclusion: the new etest esbl strip containing cefepime-clavulanate is a valuable supplement to  current methods for detection of esbls. in our study collection, the cefepime-clavulanate strip was the best configuration for detection of esbls, particularly in enterobacter spp.

TI  == chromophoric spin-labeled beta-lactam antibiotics for endor structural characterization of reaction intermediates of class a and class c beta-lactamases.
AB  == the chromophoric spin-label substrate 6-n-[3-(2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-oxypyrrolin-3-yl)-propen-2-oyl]penicillanic acid (slppen) was synthesized by acylation of 6-aminopenicillanic acid with the acid chloride of 3-(2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-oxypyrrolinyl)-2-propenoic acid and characterized by physical methods. by application of angle-selected electron nuclear double resonance (endor), we have determined the molecular structure of slppen in solution. slppen exhibited uv absorption properties that allowed accurate monitoring of the kinetics of its enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis. the maximum value of the (substrate-product) difference extinction coefficient was 2824 m(-1) cm(-1) at 275 nm compared to 670 m(-1) cm(-1) at 232 nm for slpen [j.  am. chem. soc. 117 (1995) 6739]. for slppen, the steady-state kinetic parameters  kcat and kcat/km, determined under initial velocity conditions, were 637 +/- 36 s(-1) and 13.8 +/- 1.4 x 10(6) m(-1) s(-1), respectively, for hydrolysis catalyzed by tem-1 beta-lactamase of e. coli, and 0.5 +/- 0.04 s(-1) and 3.9 +/-  0.4 x 10(4) m(-1) s(-1) for hydrolysis catalyzed by the beta-lactamase of enterobacter cloacae p99. we have also observed "burst kinetics" for the hydrolysis of slppen with p99 beta-lactamase, indicative of formation of an acylenzyme reaction intermediate. in dmso:h2o (30:70, v:v) cryosolvent mixtures buffered to ph* 7.0, the half-life of the acylenzyme intermediate formed with the p99 enzyme at -5 degrees c was > or = 3 min, suitable for optical characterization. the observation of burst kinetics in the hydrolysis of slppen catalyzed by p99 beta-lactamase suggests that this chromophoric spin-labeled substrate is differentially sensitive to active site interactions underlying the  cephalosporinase and penicillinase reactivity of this class c enzyme.

TI  == gram-negative bacillary meningitis after cranial surgery or trauma in adults.
AB  == in order to assess the clinical features, aetiology, treatment and outcome of post-neurosurgical and post-traumatic gram-negative bacillary meningitis (gnbm) we performed a retrospective review of all adult patients admitted to the department of neurosurgery who had gram-negative bacilli cultured from cerebrospinal fluid (csf) following a neurosurgical procedure or traumatic head/spinal injury. during the 12 y of the review 33 patients had csf isolates of gram-negative bacilli that were thought to be significant. the median patient age was 47 y (range 22-77 y) and 21 (64%) were male. klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and escherichia coli were the most common isolates. minimal  inhibitory concentrations (mic) measured for half the patients' isolates resulted in 5 regimen changes, including 2 patients with e. cloacae meningitis in whom cephalosporin susceptibility decreased during cephalosporin treatment. our recommended initial treatment was intravenous ceftriaxone and amikacin, subsequently tailored by susceptibility results; approximately half the patients  remained on the antibiotics they started and half were changed to an alternate regimen, most often a carbapenem. five patients (15%) died, 1 dying after cure of his gnbm. there were no failures in those who received more than 12 d of appropriate treatment: treatment for at least 14 d after the last positive csf culture guaranteed cure. initial ceftriaxone and amikacin subsequently changing to susceptibility driven alternatives, often a carbapenem, resulted in cure of 85% of our patients with gnbm.

TI  == the antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  == previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against gram- escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against gram+ micrococcus sp., is melanization. we examined the immune responses mounted by aedes aegypti towards gram- enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium, and gram+ bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial gram type and pathogenicity. these data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to  the immune response against prokaryotes.

TI  == peritoneal fluid titer test for peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis.
AB  == standard microbiological tests (i.e., mic) do not account for the unique factors  of peritoneal dialysis (pd)-related peritonitis which can significantly influence treatment response. our goals were to develop a peritoneal fluid titer (pft) test and to conduct a pilot study of its association with clinical outcome. the methodology was developed by using spent dialysate collected from patients with bacterial pd-related peritonitis prior to the initiation of antibiotics. dialysate was processed and spiked with antibiotic to simulate two standard intraperitoneal regimens: cefazolin plus tobramycin and cefazolin alone. thirty-six clinical isolates, including staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, were tested. in the pilot study, dialysate was collected from 14 patients with bacterial pd-related peritonitis. titers were determined by using each patient's dialysate and infecting pathogen. titers were  highly reproducible, with discrepancies in only 1% of cases. overall, pfts were notably higher against gram-positive bacteria (p < 0.0001). the addition of tobramycin increased titers significantly from zero to values of 1/16 to 1/64 against e. cloacae and p. aeruginosa (p < 0.0001). in the pilot study, peritoneal fluid inhibitory titers were significantly associated with clinical outcome, with a median value of 1/96 for patients who were cured compared to 1/32 for those who failed treatment (p = 0.036). in conclusion, this study provides preliminary support for the pft as a pharmacodynamic index specific to the treatment of pd-related peritonitis. with further characterization and validation in patients, the pft test may advance the study of antibiotic therapies for pd-related peritonitis.

AB  == doripenem (s-4661), a new parenteral carbapenem, was tested against over 250 clinical isolates, mutants, and transconjugants of enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter spp., selected or derived for their beta-lactamase expression characteristics. imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem were tested as comparators, along with cephalosporins and piperacillin-tazobactam, by using national committee for clinical laboratory standards agar dilution methodology. doripenem  mics were from 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml for klebsiella isolates, irrespective of the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) or plasmid-mediated ampc or hyperproduced k1 beta-lactamase. similarly, mics of doripenem for both ampc-inducible and -derepressed enterobacter isolates were 0.06 to 0.5 microg/ml. esbl production did not raise the mics of doripenem for escherichia coli transconjugants, and studies with known expression mutants confirmed that neither inducible nor depressed ampc beta-lactamase expression was protective in enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, or morganella morganii. in all of these respects, doripenem resembled meropenem and imipenem, whereas the mics of ertapenem were raised (but still < or =1 microg/ml) for many  esbl-producing klebsiellas and ampc-derepressed e. cloacae and c. freundii strains. resistance to all carbapenems, including doripenem (mics of mostly 16 to 64 microg/ml, compared with 0.25 to 1 microg/ml for typical strains), was seen in acinetobacter isolates with metallo-beta-lactamases or oxa-carbapenemases. isolates of klebsiella and serratia spp. with imp, kpc, and sme beta-lactamases also were resistant to doripenem (mics, 8 to >64 microg/ml) and to other carbapenems, although the continued apparent susceptibility (mics, < or =0.5 microg/ml) of e. coli derivatives with cloned imp-1 and nmc-a beta-lactamases suggested that carbapenem resistance might require other factors besides the enzymes.

AB  == in this retrospective investigation, we documented the bacterial colonization of  79 patients with chronic wounds, who had been treated between january 2002 and may 2003 in an outpatient wound healing clinic of a university dermatology program. we isolated 106 facultative pathogenic bacterial strains of which 56 were staphylococcus aureus, 19 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 11 escherichia coli, 4 proteus mirabilis, 4 enterobacter cloacae, 2 serratia marcescens, 2 streptococcus group g und 8 further species. 68 of these bacterial strains were gram-positive and 46 gram-negative. moreover we identified one patient with candida parapsilosis. therefore, 70.8% of all patients showed staphylococcus aureus in their chronic wounds. determination of the specific resistances showed 17 patients to be colonized with oxacillin- resistant staphylococcus aureus (orsa) strain; this corresponds to 21.5% of all patients. consequently, 30.4% of all staphylococcus aureus isolates were orsa strains. all of the orsa isolates were sensitive to vancomycin. sensitivity to tetracycline was documented in 15, to amikacin in 13, to clindamycin in 7, to gentamicin and erythromycin in 6 of the orsa-positive patients. in the case of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, 10 were sensitive and 3 were intermediate in sensitivity. beside the obligate resistance  to oxacillin, penicillin g, ampicillin, cefuroxime and imipenem, none of the orsa was sensitive to ofloxacin. the results of our investigations demonstrate the actual spectrum of bacterial colonization in chronic wounds of patients in an university dermatologic wound clinic and underline the growing problem of orsa.

TI  == the status of antimicrobial resistance in taiwan among gram-negative pathogens: the taiwan surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (tsar) program, 2000.
AB  == in a nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (taiwan surveillance of  antimicrobial resistance, tsar), isolates were collected from 21 medical centers  and regional hospitals throughout taiwan over a three-month period in 2000 (tsar  ii). this report summarizes susceptibility data of 7 common gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii) in the tsar ii collection and compared selected key forms of resistance by epidemiologic factors and with isolates collected in 1998 (tsar i) as well as with data from international surveillance studies. resistance of the 5 enterobacteriaceae species to most of the commonly prescribed "first-line" antimicrobials in taiwan, such as ampicillin (78% in e. coli, 68% in p. mirabilis), gentamicin (19% in k. pneumonia to 66% in s. marcescens), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (29% in k.  pneumoniae to 70% in p. mirabilis), was high, several of which are higher than other countries. resistance to certain broad-spectrum antimicrobials is also more acute in taiwan than most western countries, such as ceftazidime resistant a. baumannii (73%) and ciprofloxacin resistant e. coli (12%). differences in geographic regions and specimen types were associated with certain forms of resistance in tsar ii; however, the resistance problem is prevalent among both inpatients and outpatients of not only medical centers but also regional hospitals throughout taiwan.

TI  == analysis of ampc beta-lactamase expression and sequence in biochemically atypical ceftazidime-resistant enterobacteriaceae from paediatric patients.
AB  == objectives: to analyse the variation of ampc beta-lactamase gene sequence and expression in biochemically atypical enterobacteriaceae isolates, and to identify them definitively. methods: beta-lactamase gene-containing recombinant plasmids transformed into escherichia coli were selected using ampicillin. pcr analysis was used to locate specific ampc and 16s rrna genes, and the amplicons were sequenced. random amplified polymorphic dna pcr was used to group isolates and api 20e biochemical profiling was used to identify them putatively. results: of 50 ceftazidime-resistant clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates, 36 were identified (>95% confidence)-using api 20e test strips-as being organisms known to express inducible class c beta-lactamases (citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, morganella morganii or hafnia alvei). the rest were biochemically atypical. of these, isolate i113, putatively identified as e. coli, possesses a chromosomally  encoded ampc which differs by 15% from c. freundii os60 ampc and by >30% from e.  coli ampc. a related ampc gene was found in another seven of the atypical isolates. the use of various identification methods, including ampc sequence analysis, revealed that these i113-like ampc-positive isolates represent citrobacter murliniae and citrobacter youngae. conclusions: we report sequences for two new citrobacter spp. ampc genes, and provide evidence that ampc sequencing is a discriminatory method for identifying atypical citrobacter spp. isolates.

TI  == a family of brevinin-2 peptides with potent activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa from the skin of the hokkaido frog, rana pirica.
AB  == nine peptides displaying varying degrees of antimicrobial activity were extracted from the skin of the hokkaido frog, rana pirica. five structurally related peptides were identified as members of the brevinin-2 family. these peptides were active against reference strains of gram-negative (escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae) and gram-positive (staphlococcus aureus) bacteria but displayed relatively low hemolytic activity.  the most abundant peptide, brevinin-2pra (680 nmol/g weight of dry skin) showed high potency [minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values between 6 and 12 microm] against a range of clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa. in addition, activity was unaffected by nacl concentrations up to 200 mm. cladistic analysis based on the primary structures of brevinin-2 peptides supports a close phylogenetic relationship between r. pirica and japanese mountain brown frog rana ornativentris. one peptide of the ranatuerin-2 family and one strongly hemolytic  peptide of the brevinin-1 family were also isolated from the extract along with two members of the temporin family, temporin-1pra (ilpilgnllngll.nh(2)) and temporin-1prb (ilpilgnllnsll.nh(2)) that atypically lacked basic amino acid residues and showed only very weak antimicrobial and hemolytic activity.

TI  == evaluation of a new generation of plastic culture bottles with an automated microbial detection system for nine common contaminating organisms found in plt components.
AB  == background: a microbial detection system (bact/alert 3d, biomerieux [formerly organon teknika]) has previously been validated with a variety of bacterial contaminants in plts. the recovery of nine organisms seeded into plts with new plastic culture bottles was studied in comparison to the current glass bottles. the use of plastic instead of glass would be expected to reduce the risk of injury. study design and methods: isolates of bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into day 2 (>24 hr <48 hr) apheresis plt  units to 10 and 100 cfus per ml. replicate samples (4 ml) were inoculated into both current- and new-generation standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles. results: all organisms (with the exception of p. acnes) were detected in a mean time of 9.3 to 18.9 hours (10 cfus/ml) or 8.7 to 18.2 hours (100 cfus/ml). in aggregate (with the exception of p. acnes), the plastic and glass aerobic bottles had a mean difference in detection of 1.2 hours (p < 0.0001), and the plastic and glass anaerobic bottles had a mean difference of 3.3 hours (p < 0.0001). in all cases,  the mean detection time was superior or clinically comparable (within 0.1 hr) with the new plastic bottles. p. acnes (an anaerobic organism) was detected with  the new and current anaerobic bottles in a mean of 72.8 and 90.4 hours (10 cfus/ml) or 64.0 and 80.8 hours (100 cfus/ml), respectively. the narrower bottle  neck and smaller inoculation septum present with the new-generation plastic bottles were inoculated with comparable ease to that of the glass bottles. conclusions: these data demonstrate that the new plastic bottles are clinically comparable or superior to the current glass standard aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles.

TI  == longitudinal trends in fluoroquinolone resistance among enterobacteriaceae isolates from inpatients and outpatients, 1989-2000: differences in the emergence and epidemiology of resistance across organisms.
AB  == we conducted a 12-year study to identify and compare trends in annual prevalence  of fluoroquinolone (fq) resistance among enterobacteriaceae isolates obtained from inpatients and outpatients in our health care system. a total of 46,070 clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates underwent susceptibility testing. although there were significant increases in inpatient fq resistance for all enterobacteriaceae, fq resistance trends differed significantly across enterobacteriaceae (p<.001). for isolates obtained from outpatients, only escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis demonstrated significant increases in fq resistance (p<.001 for each). trends in outpatient fq resistance also differed significantly across enterobacteriaceae (p<.001). there were significant differences between inpatient and outpatient fq resistance trends for all enterobacteriaceae except p. mirabilis and enterobacter cloacae. although hospital-wide use of certain antibiotics correlated significantly with inpatient  fq resistance, these correlations differed substantially across organisms. efforts to elucidate the epidemiology of fq resistance and identify targets for intervention must recognize and account for the variability of fq resistance across organisms and clinical settings.

TI  == oral bacterial flora of dogs with and without rabies: a preliminary study in thailand.
AB  == the authors studied the bacterial flora of the dog oral cavity and of bite wounds, aerobic bacteria were isolated from mouth swabs of 16 normal and 5 rabid  dogs as well as from infected dog-bite wounds from 18 patients. a total of 20 different microbial species were recovered from mouth swab cultures. the most frequently isolated organisms were klebsiella pneumoniae ssp pneumoniae, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and pasteurella species. there were no differences in the aerobic bacterial flora between rabid and nonrabid dogs. from  the cultures of the bite wound swabs, the authors found that almost all of the organisms identified were part of the normal oral flora of the dog. one or more aerobic bacteria were isolated from the infected dog-bite wounds. two patients had four, 3 had three, 4 had two, and 6 had one of the nine organisms in their wounds. the predominant species of bacteria involved in infection of bite wounds  were, as follows: staphylococcus aureus, pasteurella multocida, e. coli, moraxella species, pasteurella canis, and enterobacter cloacae. however, three wound cultures had no aerobic bacterial growth. the results of this study show that the infected bite wounds may contain a mixed bacterial flora that colonize human skin and the oral cavity of dogs.

TI  == increasing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa in korea: konsar study in 2001.
AB  == the 5th year konsar surveillance in 2001 was based on routine test data at 30 participating hospitals. it was of particular interest to find a trend in the resistances of enterococci to vancomycin, of enterobacteriaceae to the 3rd generation cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone, and of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacters to carbapenem. resistance rates of gram-positive cocci were: 70% of staphylococcus aureus to oxacillin; 88% and 16% of enterococcus faecium to ampicillin and vancomycin, respectively. seventy-two percent of pneumococci were  nonsusceptible to penicillin. the resistance rates of enterobacteriaceae were: escherichia coli, 28% to fluoroquinolone; klebsiella pneumoniae, 27% to ceftazidime, and 20% to cefoxitin; and enterobacter cloacae, > or =40% to cefotaxime and ceftazidime. the resistance rates of p. aeruginosa were 21% to ceftazidime, 17% to imipenem, and those of the acinetobacters were > or =61% to ceftazidime, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolone and cotrimoxazole. thirty-five percent of non-typhoidal salmonellae were ampicillin resistant, and 66% of haemophilus influenzae were beta-lactamase producers. notable changes over the 1997-2001 period were: increases in vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, and amikacin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant acinetobacters. with the increasing prevalence of resistant bacteria, nationwide surveillance has become more important for optimal patient management, for the control of nosocomial infection, and for the conservation of the newer antimicrobial agents.

TI  == primary structure and in vitro antibacterial properties of the drosophila melanogaster attacin c pro-domain.
AB  == in drosophila melanogaster, seven distinct families of antimicrobial peptides with different structures and specificities are synthesized by the fat body and released into the hemolymph during the immune response. using microscale high performance liquid chromatography, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and edman degradation, we have isolated and characterized from immune-challenged drosophila two novel induced molecules, under the control of the imd pathway, that correspond to post-translationally modified antimicrobial peptides or peptide fragments. the first molecule is a doubly glycosylated form of drosocin, an o-glycosylated peptide that kills gram-negative organisms. the second molecule represents a truncated form of the pro-domain of the drosophila attacin c carrying two post-translational modifications and has significant structural similarities to proline-rich antibacterial peptides including drosocin. we have synthesized this peptide and found that it is active against gram-negative bacteria. furthermore, this activity is potentiated when the peptide is used in combination with the drosophila antimicrobial peptide cecropin a. the synergistic action observed between these two molecules suggests that the truncated post-translationally modified pro-domain of attacin c by itself may play an important role in the antimicrobial defense of drosophila.

TI  == mechanism of action of nb2001 and nb2030, novel antibacterial agents activated by beta-lactamases.
AB  == two potent antibacterial agents designed to undergo enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic  activation were evaluated for their mechanisms of action. the compounds, nb2001 and nb2030, contain a cephalosporin with a thienyl (nb2001) or a tetrazole (nb2030) ring at the c-7 position and are linked to the antibacterial triclosan at the c-3 position. the compounds exploit beta-lactamases to release triclosan through hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring. like cephalothin, nb2001 and nb2030 were hydrolyzed by class a beta-lactamases (escherichia coli tem-1 and, to a lesser degree, staphylococcus aureus pc1) and class c beta-lactamases (enterobacter cloacae p99 and e. coli ampc) with comparable catalytic efficiencies (k(cat)/k(m)). they also bound to the penicillin-binding proteins of s. aureus and e. coli, but with reduced affinities relative to that of cephalothin. accordingly, they produced a cell morphology in e. coli consistent with the toxophore rather than the beta-lactam being responsible for antibacterial activity. in biochemical assays, they inhibited the triclosan target enoyl reductase (fabi), with 50% inhibitory concentrations being markedly  reduced relative to that of free triclosan. the transport of nb2001, nb2030, and  triclosan was rapid, with significant accumulation of triclosan in both s. aureus and e. coli. taken together, the results suggest that nb2001 and nb2030 act primarily as triclosan prodrugs in s. aureus and e. coli.

TI  == pharmacodynamics of meropenem and imipenem against enterobacteriaceae, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == study objective: to compare the pharmacodynamics of meropenem and imipenem, both  administered as 500 mg every 6 hours, against populations of enterobacteriaceae,  acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. design: ten thousand-subject monte carlo simulation. intervention: variability in total body clearance (clt),  volume of distribution as calculated by the terminal elimination rate (vdbeta), and minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) distributions (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, a. baumannii, p. aeruginosa) were derived from the literature for both meropenem and imipenem.  for the free drug concentrations, the percentage of the dosing interval that the  drug concentrations remain above the mic (%t>mic) for each carbapenem-bacteria combination was calculated for 10,000 iterations, substituting a different clt, vdbeta, fraction of unbound drug, and mic into the equation each time based on the probability distribution for each parameter. probabilities of attaining targets of 30%, 50%, and 100% t>mic were calculated. measurements and main results: meropenem free drug %t>mic exposure was significantly greater than that  of imipenem against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, whereas imipenem exposure was greater for a. baumannii. for both agents, free drug %t>mic exposure was greatest against enterobacteriaceae and less for a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa. probabilities of target attainment for 30% and 50% t>mic were similar between drugs for most bacteria. at 100% t>mic, meropenem target attainments were greater than those of imipenem against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, and  imipenem attainment was higher for a. baumannii. conclusion: the probability of attaining lower pharmacodynamic targets for most gram-negative bacteria is similar for these carbapenems; however, differences become apparent as the pharmacodynamic requirement increases. further study of the benefits of achieving this pharmacodynamic breakpoint with a higher probability of attaining targets is necessary.

TI  == a novel integrative and conjugative element (ice) of escherichia coli: the putative progenitor of the yersinia high-pathogenicity island.
AB  == diversification of bacterial species and pathotypes is largely caused by horizontal transfer of diverse dna elements such as plasmids, phages and genomic  islands (e.g. pathogenicity islands, pais). a pai called high-pathogenicity island (hpi) carrying genes involved in siderophore-mediated iron acquisition (yersiniabactin system) has previously been identified in yersinia pestis, y. pseudotuberculosis and y. enterocolitica ib strains, and has been characterized as an essential virulence factor in these species. strikingly, an orthologous hpi is a widely distributed virulence determinant among escherichia coli and other enterobacteriaceae which cause extraintestinal infections. here we report on the  hpi of e. coli strain ecor31 which is distinct from all other hpis described to date because the ecor31 hpi comprises an additional 35 kb fragment at the right border compared to the hpi of other e. coli and yersinia species. this part encodes for both a functional mating pair formation system and a dna-processing region related to plasmid clodf13 of enterobacter cloacae. upon induction of the  p4-like integrase, the entire hpi of ecor31 is precisely excised and circularised. the hpi of ecor31 presented here resembles integrative and conjugative elements termed ice. it may represent the progenitor of the hpi found in y. pestis and e. coli, revealing a missing link in the horizontal transfer of  an element that contributes to microbial pathogenicity upon acquisition.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

AB  == a molecular phylogeny for seven taxa of enteric bacteria (citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, hafnia alvei, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, and serratia plymuthica) was made from multiple isolates per taxa taken from a collection of environmental enteric bacteria. sequences from five housekeeping genes (gapa, groel, gyra, ompa, and pgi) and the 16s rrna  gene were used to infer individual gene trees and were concatenated to infer a composite molecular phylogeny for the species. the isolates from each taxa formed tight species clusters in the individual gene trees, suggesting the existence of  'genotypic' clusters that correspond to traditional species designations. these sequence data and the resulting gene trees and consensus tree provide the first data set with which to assess the utility of the recently proposed core genome hypothesis (cgh). the cgh provides a genetically based approach to applying the biological species concept to bacteria.

TI  == confirmation of escherichia coli and its distinction from klebsiella species by gas and indole formation at 44 and 44.5 degrees c.
AB  == aims: in the enumeration of coliform bacteria, confirmation of escherichia coli has been based upon gas and indole production at the elevated incubation temperature. the test for gas production has recently been questioned. the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of gas production test on the reliability of confirmation of e. coli. methods and results: the impact of several media on growth, gas and/or indole formation was tested at 44 and 44.5 degrees c using 547 environmental isolates. these were mainly e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca and enterobacter cloacae strains. another set of 250 faecal and environmental klebsiellae were tested for their maximum temperature for growth (tmax) and for gas formation. escherichia coli and even k. pneumoniae  grew well in all the media, but gas production was more dependent on the medium used. growth of the mainly gas negative ent. cloacae and k. oxytoca strains was still more sensitive to the medium and incubation conditions. tryptophan salt broth was the most productive medium for the indole test, followed by lauryl tryptose mannitole and tryptone mannitol ricinoleate broth (trm). tmax of k. oxytoca was clearly lower than tmax of k. pneumoniae but a rather high fraction of its isolates produced indole at 44.5 degrees c. conclusions: false-positive e. coli confirmation is possible if gas production is not tested for and the confirmation is based on indole test only. significance and impact of the study:  erroneous positive results on routine analysis for e. coli can occur.

TI  == a new alginate-based rapid method for determining coliforms in milk.
AB  == a new rapid method for monitoring coliforms was developed on the basis of the instant gelling effects of alginate and calcium. the effectiveness of this new method in the detection of coliforms was evaluated. tests involving escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, total coliforms in milk, cold-injured coliforms, and total coliforms in raw milk were carried out. the bacterial samples were diluted in 0.2% peptone water containing 90 mm cacl2 and added into test tubes containing modified purple broth base medium. coliform concentrations were determined on the basis of the time of color change and gas production in the alginate tubes. all results obtained by the alginate method correlated strongly with those obtained by the conventional violet red bile agar  (vrba) plating method. the alginate method reduced detection time by 12 to 14 h compared with the conventional vrba plating method. the alginate method can be applied in field studies more easily than melted-agar systems can. the results of this study indicate that the alginate method is an accurate, rapid, simple, and economical way to monitor and estimate concentrations of total coliforms in food.

TI  == evaluation of parameters affecting quantitative detection of escherichia coli o157 in enriched water samples using immunomagnetic electrochemiluminescence.
AB  == we report here the use of immunomagnetic (im) electrochemiluminescence (ecl) for  quantitative detection of esherichia coli o157:h7 in water samples following enrichment in minimal lactose broth (mlb). im beads prepared in-house with four commercial anti-o157 monoclonal antibodies were compared for efficiency of cell capture. im-ecl responses for e. coli o157:h7 (strain sea13b88) were similar for  all four commercial anti-o157 lps monoclonal antibodies. the ecl signal was linearly correlated with e. coli o157:h7 cell concentration, indicating a constant ecl response per cell. twenty-two strains of e. coli o157:h7 or o157:nm  gave comparable ecl signals using im beads prepared in-house. to assess the potential for interference from background bacteria in mlb-enriched water samples, 10(4) cells of e. coli o157:h7 (strain sea13b88) were added to enriched  samples prior to analysis. there was considerable variability in recovery of e. coli o157:h7 cells; net ecl signals ranged from 1% to 100% of expected values (i.e., percent inhibition from 0% to 99%). cultures of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, and enterobacter cloacae, subsequently isolated from mlb-enriched water samples via im separation (ims), were observed to interfere with the binding of e. coli o157:h7 cells to im beads. recoveries of 10(4) e. coli o157:h7 cells were </=10% in the presence of ca. 10(8) k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, or e. cloacae cells. none of these strains gave a positive im-ecl signal. although competitive binding decreased sensitivity, there still was a linear correlation between ecl signal and higher e. coli o157:h7 cell concentrations. these studies indicate that im-ecl in conjunction with mlb enrichment is capable of quantitatively detecting as few as 10(3) to 10(5) e. coli o157:h7 cells ml(-1), depending on percent recoveries, in enriched samples that contain ca. 10(9) total lactose-fermenting bacteria ml(-1). assuming comparable growth rates for e. coli o157:h7 and other lactose-fermenting bacteria in mlb, it may be possible to detect as few as one e. coli o157:h7 in 100 ml of raw water containing as many as 10(4) to 10(6) lactose-fermenting bacteria (i.e., total coliforms).

AB  == the predominant bacterial pathway for nitrobenzene (nb) degradation uses an nb nitroreductase and hydroxylaminobenzene (hab) mutase to form the ring-fission substrate ortho-aminophenol. we tested the hypothesis that constructed strains might accumulate the aminophenols from nitroacetophenones and other nitroaromatic compounds. we constructed a recombinant plasmid carrying nb nitroreductase (nbza) and hab mutase a (haba) genes, both from pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes js45, and  expressed the enzymes in escherichia coli js995. iptg (isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside)-induced cells of strain js995 rapidly and stoichiometrically converted nb to 2-aminophenol, 2-nitroacetophenone (2nap)  to 2-amino-3-hydroxyacetophenone (2ahap), and 3-nitroacetophenone (3nap) to 3-amino-2-hydroxyacetophenone (3ahap). we constructed another recombinant plasmid containing the nitroreductase gene (nfs1) from enterobacter cloacae and haba from strain js45 and expressed the enzymes in e. coli js996. strain js996 converted nb to 2-aminophenol, 2-nitrotoluene to 2-amino-3-methylphenol, 3-nitrotoluene to 2-amino-4-methylphenol, 4-nitrobiphenyl ether to 4-amino-5-phenoxyphenol, and 1-nitronaphthalene to 2-amino-1-naphthol. in larger-scale biotransformations catalyzed by strain js995, 75% of the 2nap transformed was converted to 2ahap, whereas 3ahap was produced stoichiometrically from 3nap. the final yields of the  aminophenols after extraction and recovery were >64%. the biocatalytic synthesis  of ortho-aminophenols from nitroacetophenones suggests that strain js995 may be useful in the biocatalytic production of a variety of substituted ortho-aminophenols from the corresponding nitroaromatic compounds.

TI  == bacteremia in hematological and oncological children with febrile neutropenia: experience in a tertiary medical center in taiwan.
AB  == a retrospective study of bacteremia in children with febrile neutropenia admitted to a medical center in taiwan from january 1999 to december 1999 was performed. there were 190 episodes of febrile neutropenia during this period and 46 pathogens were isolated from blood specimens in 38 bacteremic episodes (7 mixed infections). pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.4%), staphylococcus aureus (10.9%), klebsiella pneumoniae (10.9%), and enterobacter cloacae (10.9%) were the most common isolates. three of the 5 isolates of s. aureus were resistant to methicillin. twenty-three episodes of bacteremia (four mixed infections) were associated with recent antibiotic use. of the 23 bacteremic episodes with recent  antibiotic use, p. aeruginosa (20%), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (10%), k. pneumoniae (10%), escherichia coli (10%), and e. cloacae (10%) were isolated most often. relapsed leukemia (odds ratio 3, 95% confidence interval 1.4-6.5) and recent antibiotic therapy (odds ratio 3.4, 95% confidence interval 1.7-7.7) were  the independent risk factors of bacteremia. there were 9 mortality cases in patients with bacteremia, including 4 cases with mixed infections, and 5 cases with p. aeruginosa, e. coli, klebsiella oxytoca, s. aureus, and streptococcus mitis, respectively. broad-spectrum antibiotics were necessary in febrile neutropenic children because of the high percentage of mixed infection.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

AB  == asymptomatic prostatitis is classified as category iv in nih classification of prostatitis syndrome (1999). no report concerning this category has been present. we investigated this category histopathologically and clinically, in order to clarify the histopathological distribution and its correlation to the clinical features, in this study. among 785 patients who were suspected prostate cancer because of their high prostatic specific antigen (psa) values and to have a sextant prostate needle biopsy was performed between january, 1996 and december,  2000, 88 patients (11.2%) were diagnosed as nih category iv prostatitis (asymptomatic prostatitis). we observed all pathological specimens stained with hematoxylin-eosine, and classified them into subtypes according to the classification criteria for prostatitis defined by true et al. (1999). we also investigated the relationship between histopathological distribution and clinical features such as psa values, psa density, the incidence of pyuria or bacteriuria. in the histopathological study, grade distributions were 12.5% (11/88) in mild, 71.6% (63/88) in moderate, and 15.9% (14/88) in severe. location distributions were 2.3% (2/88) in glandular, 68.2% (60/88) in periglandular, and 29.5% (26/88)  in stromal. no relationship between these subtypes and clinical features was recognized statistically. however, 7 patients (7.95%) were diagnosed as prostate  cancers, later. pyuria was found in 29.1% (23/79). bacteriuria was present in 14.3% (11/77). isolated bacteria were 4 strains of enterococcus faccalis, 2 strains of each of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, and one strain of each of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. gram positive rod, and candida sp. no relationship between these subtypes and bacterial species was recognized. these results indicated that the incidence of niii category iv prostatits was not low without correlation to any clinical features. however, we should pay attention to the presence of prostate cancer, because a small number of the patients were diagnosed as prostate cancer, later.

TI  == in vitro susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria isolated from hospitalized patients in four european countries, canada, and the united states in 2000-2001 to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and comparator antimicrobials: implications for therapy.
AB  == access to current antimicrobial agent surveillance data is an important prerequisite for the optimal management of patients with hospital-acquired infections. the present study used data collected in 2000 to 2001 from 670 laboratories in europe (france, germany, italy, and spain), canada, and the united states to report on the in vitro activities of ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and comparative agents against >125,000 isolates of gram-negative bacteria from hospitalized patients. all but two isolates of enterobacteriaceae (one isolate of proteus mirabilis from france and one isolate of morganella morganii from canada) were susceptible to imipenem. the susceptibility of escherichia coli to ceftriaxone or cefotaxime was > or = 97% in each country, and for p. mirabilis, susceptibility was 99% in each country except italy. in contrast, susceptibility  of e. coli to ciprofloxacin varied from 80.5% (spain) to 94.0% (france); levofloxacin susceptibility ranged from 75.2% (spain) to 91.6% (united states). among klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca isolates, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime susceptibilities ranged from 86.6 to 98.7% and 83.5 to 99.7%, respectively, depending upon the country. considerable geographic variation in the susceptibilities (generally 85 to 95% susceptible) of serratia marcescens and m. morganii to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were observed. for s. marcescens, susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam varied from 81.5% (france) to 94.1% (italy) and susceptibility to ciprofloxacin ranged from 66.2% (germany) to 90.7%  (spain). enterobacter cloacae and enterobacter aerogenes were less susceptible to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime than were the other species of enterobacteriaceae studied. the present study demonstrated that established parenteral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin antimicrobial agents retain significant in vitro  activity against many clinically important gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == beta-lactamase stability of faropenem.
AB  == faropenem (far) is an orally available member of the penem class unique among carbapenems and other available beta-lactams. this study compared far to cephalosporins and imipenem with respect to beta-lactamase (bla) stability and emergence of resistance to staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. bla stability was studied using enzyme preparations from sonicated/centrifuged 24-hour cultures of e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, proteus vulgaris, providencia  rettgeri, klebsiella pneumoniae, s. aureus, and bacteroides fragilis grown in the presence of 20 mg/l ampicillin or cephaloridine to induce penicillinase or cephalosporinase, respectively. substrate hydrolysis was quantitated spectrophotometrically. multistep acquisition of resistance was promoted by growing bacteria in broth containing 2-fold dilutions of antibiotic over 10 cycles. aliquots from test tubes with visible growth provided the inoculum for the next series of dilutions. far as well as other cephalosporins tested were highly stable to penicillinase derived from s. aureus and e. coli. however, e. coli- and p. vulgaris-derived cephalosporinase hydrolyzed cephaloridine, cefaclor and cefotiam considerably, whereas far was highly stable. far was highly stable against hydrolysis by various blas prepared from four b. fragilis strains and the rate of far hydrolysis by metallo-bla was 5 times lower than that for imipenem. additionally, the acquisition of resistant s. aureus strains was less pronounced  for far compared to other agents tested. mics rose 8-fold after the 10th sub-mic  exposure, while mics rose 16-, 31- and 512-fold for cefixime, cefazolin and cefaclor, respectively. e. coli shifts in mics were moderate for all the agents tested. in conclusion, far is characterized by pronounced bla stability compared  to other cephalosporins and imipenem. furthermore, a lower propensity for resistance development with far as compared to cephalosporins was observed.

TI  == enhancement of plasmid curing by 9-aminoacridine and two phenothiazines in the presence of proton pump inhibitor 1-(2-benzoxazolyl)-3,3,3-trifluoro-2-propanone.
AB  == plasmid-containing bacteria often cause serious therapeutic failure during the treatment of infectious diseases. the selection of resistant-mutant strains and the transfer of mobile genetic determinants (such as plasmids and transposons) of resistance promote increased antibiotic resistance. in the last 30 years the antiplasmid effect of acridine dyes, ethidium bromide, sodium dodecyl sulphate and phenothiazines was described. the main aim of this study was to test the mechanism of the antiplasmid effect of promethazine and 9-aminoacridine on doxycycline-resistant enteric bacteria. the antiplasmid effects of promethazine and 9-aminoacridine were studied on plasmid elimination of native plasmid dna and plasmid dna isolated from drug-treated cells of plasmid-containing escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae. the effects of some phenothiazines on plasmid profiles of bacterial strains isolated from urinary tract infections were analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis. various complex of plasmid dna were identified in the presence of promethazine, trifluoperazine and  9-aminoacridine in the agarose gel electrophoresis. doxycycline resistance of tested enteric bacteria was the target of "curing" in the presence of promethazine and trifluoperazine. the frequency of elimination of tetracycline resistance was low despite the formation of antiplasmid compounds complex with isolated plasmid dna. tetracycline resistance plasmid was isolated and re-transformed. the plasmid curing effects of promethazine, trifluoperazine and 9-aminoacridine were increased in the presence of a trifluoroketone proton pump inhibitor on e. coli k12 le140 strain in a model experiment. we propose that the  inefficient penetration of antiplasmid compounds could be responsible for the weak plasmid-curing effect in some clinical isolates and that membrane active, calmodulin- and proton pump inhibitors may be combined for plasmid curing in antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

AB  == udp-n-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase (mura) and 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (aroa) constitute the small enzyme family of enolpyruvyl transferases, which catalyze the chemically unusual reaction of enolpyruvyl transfer. mura catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall; aroa is the sixth enzyme of the shikimate pathway leading to the synthesis of aromatic compounds in numerous microorganisms and plants. because both metabolic pathways are absent from mammals but essential for the growth of microorganisms, mura and aroa are attractive targets for the development of novel antimicrobial drugs. we have determined the x-ray structures of the d305a mutant of enterobacter cloacae mura  and the d313a mutant of escherichia coli aroa, both of which crystallized in the  presence of their substrates. the structures depict the tetrahedral reaction intermediate states of the enzymes and prove that, without the aspartate side chain, the overall addition-elimination reaction in both enzymes is halted after  the addition step. the presented structures lead to a new view of the catalytic mechanism and, moreover, provide an ideal starting point for the rational design  of potent inhibitors of mura and aroa.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae in buenos aires, argentina, public hospitals.
AB  == resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is often associated with plasmid encoded extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl). in order to evaluate the prevalence and diversity of esbls in enterobacteria in our city, a 1-month-period survey was carried out from april to may 2000. extended-spectrum-cephalosporin-resistant strains, isolated from inpatient clinical specimens other than stools, were collected among 17 participating hospitals. from a total of 427 enterobacterial strains that were collected during this period, 39 were extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistant. the national committee for clinical laboratory standards' screening and confirmatory tests for esbl production were performed using cefotaxime and ceftazidime; cefepime and cefepime-clavulanic acid-containing disks were included. beta-lactamases were characterized by isoelectric focusing and pcr amplification using specific primers. three different esbls were detected: shv-related (4 isolates), per-2-type (9 isolates), and ctx-m-2-related (26 isolates). sequencing of the corresponding genes confirmed ctx-m-2 in 19 of 21 and ctx-m-31 (an allelic variant) in the remaining 2 of 21. ctx-m-2 (or its variant) was detected in all escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, and providencia stuartii strains, while per-2 was detected in enterobacter cloacae, e. aerogenes, and klebsiella pneumoniae; shv-related esbl were found only in k. pneumoniae. these results clearly show that ctx-m-2 is the most prevalent esbl produced by enterobacterial species isolated from public hospitals in buenos aires.

AB  == objective: to determine the resistance rates of gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with hospital acquired infections (hai) or community acquired infections (cai) in the 34 study wards of 13 hospitals located at different areas in china. methods: 1596 strains of gram-negative bacilli from the 2401 pathogenic strains isolated from 13 hospitals 1 july 2000 to 30 june 2001 were collected for susceptibility test using international standard two-fold agar dilution method. according to the criteria of guidelines of nccls (2001), mic(50) and mic(90) were detected for antibacterial activity of antimicrobial agents and r%, i%, and s%, were calculated to show the resistant, intermediate and susceptible rates of bacteria to the compounds tested. results: 15 species of gram-negative pathogens  were isolated and most of them could be isolated from both cai and hai patients.  the resistance rates of isolates, especially enterobacter cloacae, serratia spp.  and acinetobacter spp. from hai were higher than those of cai. the carbopenems were the most active compounds tested against enterobacteriaceae. cefoperozone/sulbactam and cefprime demonstrated excellent activity against most  of gram-negative bacilli. most of the gram-negative bacilli were still rather susceptible to cefatazidime, a third generation cephalosporin, with a susceptibility rate of 70% to 100%. fluoroquinolones showed strong and broad-spectrum activity against gram-negative bacilli, but more than 50% of escherichia coli strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones, and the susceptible  rates to fluoroquinolones of pseudomonas aeruginosa and haemophilus influenzae had decreased. conclusion: (1) the results obtained in the two surveillance-years, 2000 - 2001 and 1998 - 1999, were similar in the bacterial resistance pattern and the trend of rising of resistant rates for some gram-negative pathogens. (2) the resistance rates of isolates from hai patients were higher than those of cai.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of three fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates by e test.
AB  == the in vitro susceptibility of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against several gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates was tested by e test. we found that the mic(50) and mic(90) values against all members of the enterobacteriaceae family except serratia were <0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin (mic range 0.006-32 mg/l) based on the in vitro susceptibility data. the susceptibility rates for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more than 85% for escherichia coli, citrobacter, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae, although serratia and acinetobacter exhibited more or  less similar susceptibility rates (about 80%). pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance to fluoroquinolones (mic(90) >32 mg/l) and decreased bactericidal rates (<65%) to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. respiratory pathogens such as streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae were highly susceptible (100%) to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. the ineffectiveness of fluoroquinolones for treating coagulase-positive staphylococcus aureus was demonstrated by poor in vitro susceptibility rates with levofloxacin (52%) and moxifloxacin (57%). coagulase-negative staphylococci demonstrated significantly decreased bactericidal rates to levofloxacin (21%), while the in vitro susceptibility to moxifloxacin was higher (66%) than that to levofloxacin. we propose that the beneficial effect of inclusion of any of these  three fluoroquinolones in treating enterococcus infections is marginal, as demonstrated by significantly reduced susceptibility rates (<32%). these data demonstrate the utility of fluoroquinoles to treat several gram-negative bacterial infections (with the exception of acinetobacter and p. aeruginosa), as  well as s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae.

AB  == organisms producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) have been reported  in many countries, but there is no information on the prevalence of esbl-producing members of the family enterobacteriaceae in ireland. a total of 925 isolates of ampicillin-resistant members of the enterobacteriaceae were received from six hospitals in ireland over a 3-year period from september 1996 to september 1999. isolates were screened for esbl production by the double-disk  diffusion (ddd) method. ddd-positive isolates that were (i) confirmed as esbl producers by national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) confirmatory testing and (ii) susceptible to cefoxitin by disk diffusion were considered esbl producers. by these criteria, 27 (3%) of the ampicillin-resistant members of the enterobacteriaceae studied were categorized as esbl producers. molecular typing suggested that some intra- and interhospital spread of esbl-producing isolates had occurred. dna sequencing of amplified bla(tem) and bla(shv) genes resulted in the detection of a novel bla(tem) esbl gene, bla(tem-102) in two isolates (klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae) received from the same hospital but isolated from different patients. the study suggests dissemination of esbl-producing bacteria within the health care system in ireland and emphasizes the need for measures to control such spread.

TI  == identification of residues critical for catalysis in a class c beta-lactamase by  combinatorial scanning mutagenesis.
AB  == despite their clinical importance, the mechanism of action of the class c beta-lactamases is poorly understood. in contrast to the class a and class d beta-lactamases, which contain a glutamate residue and a carbamylated lysine in their respective active sites that are thought to serve as general base catalysts for beta-lactam hydrolysis, the mechanism of activation of the serine and water nucleophiles in the class c enzymes is unclear. to probe for residues involved in catalysis, the class c beta-lactamase from enterobacter cloacae p99 was studied by combinatorial scanning mutagenesis at 122 positions in and around the active site. over 1000 p99 variants were screened for activity in a high-throughput in vivo antibiotic resistance assay and sequenced by 96-capillary electrophoresis to identify residues that are important for catalysis. p99 mutants showing reduced capability to convey antibiotic resistance were purified and characterized in vitro. the screen identified an active-site hydrogen-bonding network that is key  to catalysis. a second cluster of residues was identified that likely plays a structural role in the enzyme. otherwise, residues not directly contacting the substrate showed tolerance to substitution. the study lends support to the notion that the class c beta-lactamases do not have a single residue that acts as the catalytic general base. rather, catalysis is affected by a hydrogen-bonding network in the active site, suggesting a possible charge relay system.

AB  == the chitinase gene-transformed strain kpm-007e/chi of enterobacter cloacae was vitally entrapped in sodium alginate gel beads with its specific virulent bacteriophage ecp-01 to provide a new method for microbially digesting chitinous  peritrophic membranes of phytophagous ladybird beetles epilachna vigintioctopunctata. first, chitinase sh1 from a gram-positive bacterium kurthia  zopfii was overproduced by escherichia coli cells and purified by affinity column chromatography. the purified enzyme effectively digested peritrophic membranes dissected from the ladybird beetles to expose epithelial tissues beneath the peritrophic membrane, and the beetles that had ingested chitinase after submergence in chitinase solution had considerably reduced their feeding on tomato leaves. kpm-007e/chi, entrapped in the alginate beads, released the chitinase. more chitinase was released when kpm-007e/chi was present with their specific virulent bacteriophage ecp-01 in the beads because of lysis of bacterial cells infected with the bacteriophages. this chitinase release from the microbial beads (containing kpm-007e/chi and ecp-01) was sufficient to digest the peritrophic membrane as well as to suppress feeding of bead-sprayed tomato leaves by the ladybird beetles. a daily supply of tomato leaves treated with the microbial beads considerably suppressed leaf feeding and oviposition by the ladybird beetles, suggesting a possible application of chitinase-secreting bacteria for suppressing herbivorous insect pests.

AB  == background: cirrhotic patients are usually associated with a high susceptibility  to infection. although bacterial translocation from gut mucosa to mesenteric lymph node (mln) and systemic circulation is a well-known phenomenon after hepatectomy, its role in cirrhotic patients remains unclear. materials and methods: mln was harvested for bacterial culture before and after liver resection in 181 cirrhotic patients. the characteristics and postoperative courses of patients with positive and negative bacterial culture for mln after hepatectomy were compared. postoperative systemic antibiotics were administered if infectious complications occurred. results: no bacteria were cultured in mln before hepatectomy. bacterial translocation (bt) to mln after hepatectomy occurred in 36 patients (bt group). after multivariate analysis, intraoperative blood transfusion was the only independent factor that influenced bacterial translocation rates after cirrhotic liver resection. bt group patients also had higher infectious and overall complication rates, with a longer postoperative hospital stay. among the cultured bacteriae from infected sites in bt group patients with infectious complications, only 2 patients (12.5%) had totally different bacterial species to those cultured from mlns. conclusions: bacterial translocation more often occurred after liver resection in cirrhotic patients who received intraoperative blood transfusion. such patients had higher postoperative infectious and overall complication rates. thus, avoidance of intraoperative blood transfusion is mandatory for cirrhotic liver resection.

TI  == the influence of inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment on patients with bloodstream infections in an intensive care unit.
AB  == objective: to determine the occurrence of inadequate antimicrobial therapy among  critically ill patients with bacteremia and the factors associated with it, to identify the microorganisms that received inadequate antimicrobial treatment, and to determine the relationship between inadequate treatment and patients outcome.  methods: from june 1995 to january 1999 we collected data on all clinically significant icu-bacteremias in our teaching hospital. clinical and microbiological characteristics were recorded and the adequacy of empirical antimicrobial treatment in each case was determined. we defined inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment as applying to infection that was not being effectively treated at the time the causative microorganism and its antibiotic susceptibility were known. multivariate analysis was used to determine the variables associated with inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment and to  evaluate the influence of this on the related mortality to bacteremia, using the  spss package (9.0). results: among 166 intensive care unit patients with bacteremia, 39 (23.5%) received inadequate antimicrobial treatment. in this last  group the mean age of patients was 64.1 +/- 13.2 years, and 64% were men. bacteremia was hospital-acquired in 92% of these cases. eleven percent developed  septic shock and 37.7% severe sepsis, and ultimately fatal underlying disease was present in 28.2% of patients given inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment.  the main sources of bacteremias in this group were: a vascular catheter (15.3%),  respiratory (7.6%) or unknown (53.8%). the microorganisms most frequently isolated in the group with inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (29.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (27.3%), enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and candida species (4.5% each). the frequency of coagulase-negative staphylococci in the cases with inappropriate treatment was higher than in the group with appropriate treatment (or 2.62; 95% ci: 1.10-6.21;  p = 0.015). the global mortality rate was 56% and the related mortality was 30% in the group with inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment. the only factor associated with inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment was the absence of abdominal or respiratory focus (p = 0.04; or = 0.35; 95% ci: 0.12-0.97). septic shock was related to attributable mortality (p = 0.03; or = 3.19; 95% ci: 1.08-9.40), but not inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment (p = 0.24; or =  1.71; 95% ci: 0.66-4.78). conclusion: almost a quarter of critically ill patients with bloodstream infections were given inadequate empirical antibiotic treatment, but mortality was not higher in the group with inadequate treatment than in the group with adequate treatment. this fact was probably due to microbiological factors and clinical features, such as the type of microorganism most frequently  isolated and the source of the bacteremia.

TI  == [continuous surveillance of antimicrobial resistance among nosocomial gram-negative bacilli from intensive care units in china].
AB  == objective: to investigate the change of antimicrobial resistance among nosocomial gram-negative bacilli, especially those of enterobacteriaceae isolated from intensive care units from 1994 to 2001 in china. methods: e test was made to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of 10 279 isolates of gram-negative bacilli (including 5 829 strains of bacilli of enterobacteriaceae)  from 32 hospitals in china from 1994 to 2001. results: the most common pathogens  were pseudomonas aeruginosa; escherichia coli, klebsiella spp, acinetobacter spp. enterobacter spp, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. the most common pathogens in  respiratory tract specimens were pseudomonas aeruginosa (25%), klebsiella pneumoniae (18%), and acinetobacter baumanni (11%). the most common pathogens in  blood and urine specimens were escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the antibiotic remaining the most active against all of the gram-negative bacilli for 7 years was imipenem (with a susceptibility rate of 87%), followed by cefoperazone/sulbactam (however, with a susceptibility rate decreasing from 86% to 75%), amikacin (75%), ceftazidime (73%), cefepime (72%), and piperacillin/tazobactam (71%). the susceptibility rate of escherichia coli klebsiella pneumoniae to imipenem remained 98% with a mic(90) of 0.5 micro g/ml during the 7 years, much higher than those to amikacin (84%), ceftazidime (83%),  cefoperazone/sulbactam (83%), piperacillin/tazobactam (80%), and cefepime (80%).  the susceptibility rate of these two species to cefoperazone/sulbactam decreased  from 90% in 1996 to 74% in 2001. while the susceptibility to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone decreased from 82% to 57%. the susceptibility rate of escherichia coli to ciprofloxacin decreased from 54% to 25% and that of klebsiella pneumoniae to ciprofloxacin decreased from 90% to 75%. the prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases in these two species increased from 11% in 1994 to 34% in 2001. the most active antibiotics against enterobacter cloacae were imipenem, cefepime, amikacin with the susceptible rates of 95%, 76%, and 70%, respectively; the susceptibility rates of citrobacter freundii to imipenem, cefepime, amikacin, and cefoperazone/sulbactam were 94%, 80%, 80%, and 78% respectively. only 40% approximately 60% isolates of enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii were  susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins. conclusion: imipenem remains highly active against enterobacteriaceae, but the activities of other antibiotics have decreased in recent years.

TI  == occurrence and antimicrobial resistance of gram-negative bacteria isolated in haemodialysis water and dialysate of renal units: results of a greek multicentre  study.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the occurrence, identity and antimicrobial resistance of gram-negative bacteria isolated from municipal water supplies, treated water, and dialysate of all 85 greek haemodialysis centres. methods and results: a total of  141 gram-negative bacterial isolates (98 non-fermentative and 43 enterobacteria)  were recovered from 255 water samples. twenty-four of them were isolated from tap water, 31 from treated water, and 86 from dialysate samples. the mean concentrations (cfu per 100 ml +/- s.d.) of the positive gram-negative bacteria samples were 69.2 +/- 43.9, 31.2 +/- 28.7 and 3552.3 +/- 4485.0, respectively. the most common isolates, in order of frequency were pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.7%), chryseobacterium meningosepticum (14.9%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (13.5%), escherichia coli (12.8%) and enterobacter cloacae (7.8%), representing 71.6% of all isolates. ps. aeruginosa was the most prevalent isolate in all types of water sample followed by c. meningosepticum in tap and treated water and by e. coli in dialysate. nineteen per cent of the enterobacteria and 35% of the non-fermenters were resistant against three or more of the nine antibiotics tested. conclusions: these data suggest that dialysate and treated water could be a source of infection for several non-fermentative and enterobacterial species. impact of the study: microbiological monitoring of such samples is needed in order to know the identity and antibiotic resistance profiles of their potentially pathogenic bacterial population.

TI  == altered substrate selection of the melibiose transporter (mely) of enterobacter cloacae involving point mutations in leu-88, leu-91, and ala-182 that confer enhanced maltose transport.
AB  == we isolated mutants of escherichia coli hs4006 containing the melibiose-h(+) symporter (mely) from enterobacter cloacae that had enhanced fermentation on 1% maltose macconkey plates. dna sequencing revealed three site classes of mutations: l-88-p, l-91-p, and a-182-p. the mutants l-88-p and l-91-p had 3.6- and 5.1-fold greater maltose uptake than the wild type and enhanced apparent affinities for maltose. energy-coupled transport was defective for melibiose accumulation, but detectable maltose accumulation for the mutants indicated that  active transport is dependent upon the substrate transported through the carrier. we conclude that the residues leu-88, leu-91 (transmembrane segment 3 [tms-3]), and ala-182 (tms-6) of mely mediate sugar selection. these data represent the first mely mutations that confer changes in sugar selection.

TI  == studies on structure-function relationships of indolepyruvate decarboxylase from  enterobacter cloacae, a key enzyme of the indole acetic acid pathway.
AB  == enterobacter cloacae, isolated from the rhizosphere of cucumbers, produces large  amounts of indole-3-acetic acid. indolepyruvate decarboxylase, the key enzyme in  the biosynthetic pathway of indole-3-acetic acid, catalyses the formation of indole-3-acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide from indole-3-pyruvic acid. the enzyme requires the cofactors thiamine diphosphate and magnesium ions for catalytic activity. recombinant indolepyruvate decarboxylase was purified from the host escherichia coli strain jm109. specificity of the enzyme for the substrates indole-3-pyruvic acid, pyruvic acid, benzoylformic acid, and seven benzoylformic  acid analogues was investigated using a continuous optical assay. stopped-flow kinetic data showed no indication for substrate activation in the decarboxylation reaction of indole-3-pyruvic acid, pyruvic acid or benzoylformic acid. size exclusion chromatography and small angle x-ray solution scattering experiments suggested the tetramer as the catalytically active state and a ph-dependent subunit association equilibrium. analysis of the kinetic constants of the benzoylformic acid analogues according to hansch et al. [hansch, c., leo, a., unger, s.h., kim, k.h., nikaitani, d & lien, e.j. (1973) j. med. chem.16, 1207-1216] and comparison with indole-3-pyruvic acid conversion by pyruvate decarboxylases from saccharomyces cerevisiae and zymomonas mobilis provided some  insight into the catalytic mechanism of indolepyruvate decarboxylase.

TI  == crystal structure of thiamindiphosphate-dependent indolepyruvate decarboxylase from enterobacter cloacae, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid.
AB  == the thiamin diphosphate-dependent enzyme indolepyruvate decarboxylase catalyses the formation of indoleacetaldehyde from indolepyruvate, one step in the indolepyruvate pathway of biosynthesis of the plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid. the crystal structure of this enzyme from enterobacter cloacae has been determined at 2.65 a resolution and refined to a crystallographic r-factor of 20.5% (rfree 23.6%). the subunit of indolepyruvate decarboxylase contains three domains of open alpha/beta topology, which are similar in structure to that of pyruvate decarboxylase. the tetramer has pseudo 222 symmetry and can be described as a dimer of dimers. it resembles the tetramer of pyruvate decarboxylase from zymomonas mobilis, but with a relative difference of 20 degrees in the angle between the two dimers. active site residues are highly conserved in indolepyruvate/pyruvate decarboxylase, suggesting that the interactions with the  cofactor thiamin diphosphate and the catalytic mechanisms are very similar. the substrate binding site in indolepyruvate decarboxylase contains a large hydrophobic pocket which can accommodate the bulky indole moiety of the substrate. in pyruvate decarboxylases this pocket is smaller in size and allows discrimination of larger vs. smaller substrates. in most pyruvate decarboxylases, restriction of cavity size is due to replacement of residues at three positions by large, hydrophobic amino acids such as tyrosine or tryptophan.

TI  == polymorphism in the yclc-rpos region of enterobacteria.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence downstream from the rpos gene in enterobacter cloacae and kluyvera cryocrescens contains the slya-pad1-yclc genes. the dna sequence of enterobacter cloacae cetc960 shows a 2.6-kb insertion of unknown origin between rpos and slya. this 2.6-kb sequence has also been detected in species of salmonella and in pseudomonas aeruginosa, but not in the same location. this insertion has been detected in all the enterobacter cloacae clinical strains studied although the size of the rpos-yclc region was highly variable, possibly owing to the presence of insertions and/or deletions. the study of the rpos-muts  region in other enterobacteria also showed variability in size. our results support the idea of a variational hot spot in the rpos-muts region that could be  related to pathogenesis and horizontal transfer.

TI  == in vitro synergy studies using aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combinations against six species of gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == background: combination antimicrobial therapy is often necessary to eradicate infections caused by gram-negative bacteria. methods: to evaluate the potential benefit of aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combination therapy, the activity of aztreonam in combination with ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin was assessed using checkerboard testing for four clinical isolates of each of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, burkholderia cepacia and pseudomanas aeruginosa. results: all aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combinations demonstrated additive activity [fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) index >0.5-4] or synergy (fic index <or=0.5) for all 24 isolates tested. aztreonam plus ciprofloxacin was the most effective combination, demonstrating synergy against 16.7% of isolates (2 p. mirabilis, 1 e. cloacae, 1 b. cepacia). aztreonam in combination with moxifloxacin was synergistic against 2 isolates (p. mirabilis, e. cloacae), and in combination with gatifloxacin against 1 isolate (e. cloacae). aztreonam and levofloxacin demonstrated only additive activity. conclusion: additive activity was observed for the majority of the aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combinations tested against six species of gram-negative bacilli. synergy involving aztreonam  and fluoroquinolone combinations was less common than additive activity and was isolate dependent. although in vivo clinical successes have been documented using aztreonam in combination with other agents, confirmation by laboratory techniques requires further investigation.

TI  == trends in antimicrobial susceptibilities among enterobacteriaceae isolated from hospitalized patients in the united states from 1998 to 2001.
AB  == longitudinal surveillance of enterobacteriaceae for antimicrobial susceptibility  is important because species of this family are among the most significant and prevalent human pathogens. to estimate rates of in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility among hospitalized patients in the united states, data from the surveillance network were studied for 14 agents tested against 10 species of enterobacteriaceae (n = 384,279) isolated from intensive-care-unit (icu) patients and non-icu inpatients from 1998 to 2001. cumulative susceptibility (percent) data for all species of enterobacteriaceae isolated from icu patients and non-icu inpatients, respectively, were ranked as follows: ampicillin-sulbactam (45.5 and  57.2) << ticarcillin-clavulanate (74.8 and 83.5) < trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole  (87.0 and 84.5) congruent with cefotaxime (82.9 and 92.6) = ceftazidime (82.3 and 91.0) = ceftriaxone (86.5 and 93.9) = piperacillin-tazobactam (83.5 and 90.5) < levofloxacin (89.3 and 90.6) = ciprofloxacin (91.0 and 91.7) < gentamicin (91.8 and 94.3) < cefepime (95.0 and 97.9) < amikacin (98.5 and 99.2) < imipenem (100 and 100) = meropenem (100 and 100). of those agents studied only susceptibilities to ciprofloxacin (94 to 89%) and levofloxacin (93 to 89%) decreased in a stepwise manner from 1998 to 2001. decreased fluoroquinolone susceptibility was most pronounced for escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae. for all species of enterobacteriaceae, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance was more commonly observed in isolates with a single-drug resistance phenotype while  gentamicin and fluoroquinolone resistances were more common in isolates resistant to at least one additional class of antimicrobial agent. ongoing surveillance of  enterobacteriaceae will be particularly important to monitor changes in fluoroquinolone susceptibility, as well as changes in the prevalence of isolates  resistant to multiple classes of antimicrobial agents.

AB  == am-112 [(1'r,5r,6r)-3-(4-amino-1,1-dimethyl-butyl)-6-(1'-hydroxyethyl)oxapenem-3-carboxy late] is a novel oxapenem compound which possesses potent beta-lactamase-inhibitory properties. fifty-percent inhibitory concentrations (ic(50)s) of am-112 for class a enzymes were between 0.16 and 2.24 micro m for three enzymes, compared to ic(50)s of 0.008 to 0.12 micro m for clavulanic acid.  against class c and class d enzymes, however, the activity of am-112 was between  1,000- and 100,000-fold greater than that of clavulanic acid. am-112 had affinity for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of escherichia coli dc0, with pbp2 being inhibited by the lowest concentration of am-112 tested, 0.1 micro g/ml. ceftazidime was combined with am-112 at 1:1 and 2:1 ratios in mic determination studies against a panel of beta-lactamase-producing organisms. these studies demonstrated that am-112 was effective at protecting ceftazidime against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains and derepressed class c enzyme producers, reducing ceftazidime mics by 16- and 2,048-fold. similar results were  obtained when am-112 was combined with ceftriaxone, cefoperazone, or cefepime in  a 1:2 ratio. protection of ceftazidime with am-112 was maintained against enterobacter cloacae p99 and klebsiella pneumoniae shv-5 in a murine intraperitoneal sepsis model. the 50% effective dose of ceftazidime against e. cloacae p99 and k. pneumoniae shv-5 was reduced from >100 and 160 mg/kg of body weight to 2 and 33.6 mg/kg, respectively, when it was combined with am-112 at a 1:1 ratio. am-112 demonstrates potential as a new beta-lactamase inhibitor.

TI  == characterization of clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae from italy by the bd  phoenix extended-spectrum beta-lactamase detection method.
AB  == production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) is an important mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in enterobacteriaceae: identification of esbls based on phenotypic tests is the strategy most commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories. the phoenix esbl test (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md.) is a recently developed automated system for detection of esbl-producing gram-negative bacteria. an algorithm based on phenotypic responses to a panel of cephalosporins (ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, cefotaxime plus clavulanic acid,  cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone plus clavulanic acid) was used to test 510 clinical  isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus  mirabilis, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, and citrobacter  koseri. of these isolates, 319 were identified as esbl producers, and the remaining 191 were identified as non-esbl producers based on the results of current phenotypic tests. combined use of isoelectric focusing, pcr, and/or dna sequencing demonstrated that 288 isolates possessed bla(tem-1)- and/or bla(shv-1)-derived genes, and 28 had a bla(ctx-m) gene. among the 191 non-esbl-producing isolates, 77 isolates produced an ampc-type enzyme, 110 isolates possessed tem-1, tem-2, or shv-1 beta-lactamases, and the remaining four isolates (all k. oxytoca strains) hyperproduced k1 chromosomal beta-lactamase. the phoenix esbl test system gave positive results for all the 319 esbl-producing isolates and also for two of the four k1-hyperproducing isolates of k. oxytoca. compared with the phenotypic tests and molecular analyses, the phoenix system displayed 100% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity. these findings suggest that the phoenix esbl test can be a rapid and reliable method for laboratory detection of  esbl resistance in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == factors influencing gene expression and resistance for gram-negative organisms expressing plasmid-encoded ampc genes of enterobacter origin.
AB  == high-level expression of ampc beta-lactamases results in organisms resistant to multiple beta-lactam antibiotics. the mechanism of chromosomally mediated ampc resistance has been elucidated, however the mechanism(s) driving plasmid-encoded  ampc resistance are unknown. studies were designed to identify factors which influence expression of plasmid-encoded ampc genes and correlate these factors with resistance. as the model system, ampc genes of enterobacter origin were used to determine how gene copy number, genetic background and genetic organization influenced resistance phenotypes. to this end, gene expression from the plasmid-encoded inducible blaact-1 and non-inducible blamir-1 were compared with  chromosomal ampc gene expression from both wild-type (wt) and derepressed enterobacter cloacae isolates. rna levels within the original clinical isolates were examined using primer extension analysis, whereas a new pcr strategy was developed to examine gene copy number. these data revealed that blaact-1 and blamir-1 constitutive expression was 33- and 95-fold higher than wt expression, whereas copy numbers of the plasmid-encoded genes were 2 and 12, respectively. differences in promoters and transcriptional starts for the respective plasmid-encoded genes were noted and contribute to increases observed in overall  expression. finally, beta-lactam mics were increased two- to 16-fold when blaact-1 was expressed in escherichia coli ampd- strains compared with e. coli ampd+ strains. in conclusion, high-level expression of plasmid-encoded ampc genes requires interplay between multiple factors including genetic organization, promoter modifications, genetic background, and to some extent gene copy number.  in addition, clinical laboratories need to be aware that genetic backgrounds of inducible plasmid-encoded genes can dramatically influence mics for organisms not normally associated with derepressed phenotypes.

TI  == analyses of ampc gene expression in serratia marcescens reveal new regulatory properties.
AB  == serratia marcescens encodes an inducible, chromosomal beta-lactamase, ampc. studies addressing the regulation of inducible ampc genes have focused primarily  on enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii. the purpose of this study was to clone and sequence the ampc, ampr and intergenic region of s. marcescens and examine both inducible and basal level ampc expression. sequence analysis of the  s. marcescens ampc gene identified an extended 5' untranslated region (utr) of 126 nucleotides, which formed a prominent stem-loop structure. induction of ampc  expression required ampr, and the start of transcription was determined using primer extension analysis. in vivo half-life analysis revealed that the half-life of the s. marcescens ampc transcript was 7 min. confirmation of the in vivo half-life and the role of the stem-loop structure in the 5' utr was demonstrated  by comparing transcript half-life and luciferase expression between a wild-type (wt) and a 5' utr stem-loop deletion mutant. these data demonstrated that the stem-loop structure was involved in transcript stability. taken together, these findings indicate that constitutive expression of s. marcescens ampc is regulated by both transcriptional initiation and post-transcriptional events.

AB  == the aim of this study was to research the distribution in the kinki region of japan of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) and metallo beta-lactamase (mbl). one thousand isolates, 200 of each of four enterobacterial species (i.e. escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens) and 200 of p. aeruginosa, were collected from seven different laboratories during two 2 month periods, one in 1998 and one in 2000. a double-disc synergy test (ddst) and 2-mercaptopropionic acid inhibition test (2-mpat) were used to confirm beta-lactamase-producing isolates. the ddst was positive for one isolate of e. coli, five of k. pneumoniae, two of e. cloacae and 14 of s. marcescens. the 2-mpat was positive for five isolates of s. marcescens and two of p. aeruginosa.  we identified the beta-lactamase type of each isolate by molecular confirmatory tests (isoelectric focusing, pcr and dna sequencing): ctx-m-3 esbls (three isolates of k. pneumoniae, two of e. cloacae and 13 of s. marcescens), ctx-m-2 esbl (one isolate of k. pneumoniae), shv-12 esbls (one isolate of e. coli and one of s. marcescens), ctx-m-3 and shv-12 combination esbl (one isolate of k. pneumoniae) and imp-1 mbls (five isolates of s. marcescens and two of p. aeruginosa). in conclusion, many species of gram-negative bacilli that produce ctx-m-3 esbls and imp-1 mbls were disseminated widely in different hospitals of the kinki region of japan. therefore, monitoring of laboratory bacterial ecology  seems important to stop the spread of these strains through nosocomial outbreaks.

TI  == microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  == aim: the present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. methods: we identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp). results: nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. a single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per ml of bile (> 105 cfu/ml). the predominant gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). the predominant gram-positive bacteria were enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. all gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (cim90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/ml. gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. although all five isolates of e. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) e. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. conclusion: e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. faecalis and streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.

AB  == the cyclic acyl phosph(on)ates, 1-hydroxy-5-phenyl-2,6-dioxaphosphorinone(3)-1-oxide, its 4-phenyl isomer, and the phosphonate (2-oxo) analogue of the latter inhibited typical class a (tem-2)  and class c (enterobacter cloacae p99) beta-lactamases in a time-dependent fashion. no enzyme-catalyzed turnover was detected in any case. the interactions  occurring were interpreted in terms of the reaction scheme e + i left arrow over  right arrow ei left arrow over right arrow ei', where ei is a reversibly formed noncovalent complex, and ei' is a covalent complex. reactions of the cyclic phosphates with the p99 beta-lactamase were effectively irreversible, while that  of the 4-phenyl cyclic phosphate with the tem beta-lactamase was slowly reversible. the 4-phenyl cyclic phosphate was generally the most effective inhibitor, both kinetically and thermodynamically, with second-order rate constants of inactivation of both enzymes around 10(4) s(-1) m(-1). this compound also bound noncovalently to both enzymes, with dissociation constants of 25 microm from the p99 enzyme and 100 microm from the tem. it is unusual to find an  inhibitor equally effective against the tem and p99 enzymes; the beta-lactamase inhibitors currently employed in medical practice (e.g., clavulanic acid) are significantly more effective against class a enzymes. the results of lysinoalanine analysis after hydroxide treatment of the inhibited enzymes and of  a (31)p nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of one such complex were interpreted  as favoring a mechanism of inactivation by enzyme acylation rather than phosphylation. molecular modeling of the enzyme complexes of the 4-phenyl phosphate revealed bound conformations where recyclization and thus reactivation  of the enzyme would be difficult. the compounds studied were turned over slowly or not at all by acetylcholinesterase and phosphodiesterase i.

TI  == effects of burn wound excision on bacterial colonization and invasion.
AB  == rates of survival after thermal injury have improved in the past two decades, and rates of wound infections and sepsis have decreased during the same period. early excision has been advocated as one of the major factors, but its safety and efficacy and the exact timing of burn excision are still under debate. it was hypothesized that acute burn wound excision (in the first 24 hours after burning) would be superior to conservative treatment and delayed excision in preventing bacterial colonization and invasion. twenty consecutive patients with thermal injuries were studied. twelve patients underwent acute burn wound excision, and eight patients underwent conservative treatment and delayed excision. the second  group of patients received topical treatments in another facility and underwent delayed excision after transfer to our service, on postburn day 6. quantitative bacteriological assessments of the excised wound and biopsy samples of the wound  bed, obtained before autografting and/or homografting, were performed. the effects of time on bacterial counts, differences between superficial and deep biopsy samples, and the effects of early versus late debridement were studied. patients admitted early exhibited bacterial counts of less than 10 bacteria per gram of tissue. patients in this group did not experience infection or graft loss. patients admitted late exhibited counts of more than 10 bacteria (p = 0.001, compared with early admission). three patients in the late excision group  experienced infection and graft loss (p < 0.05, compared with the early excision  group). burn wound excision significantly decreased bacterial colonization for all patients (p < 0.001). greater bacterial colonization and higher rates of infection were correlated with topical treatment and late excision (p < 0.001). it is concluded that burn wound excision significantly reduces bacterial colonization. patients who undergo topical treatment and delayed burn wound excision exhibit greater bacterial colonization and increased rates of infection. acute burn wound excision should be considered for all full-thickness burns.

AB  == we examined antibacterial activities and pk/pd parameters of six kinds of aminoglycosides against seven bacterial species of clinical isolates in 2001. aminoglycoseides examined were gentamicin (gm), dibekacin (dkb), tobramycin (tob), amikacin (amk), netilmicin (ntl), and isepamicin (isp), and bacterial isolates used were each 50 strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, proteus spp., serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. all aminoglycosides showed good activities with low mics  against 6 species of enterobacteriacea except s. marcescens. eight strains (3.2%) among them were resistant to one or more aminoglycosides. resistance to multiple  aminoglycosides were detected in 16 strains (32%) of s. marcescens, among which 13 strains were resistant to amk but susceptible to isp. three (6%) strains of p. aeruginosa were resistant to multiple drugs, one of which was resistant to all six aminoglycosides, and others were moderately susceptible to amk and isp, and susceptible to gm, amk and isp. using a ratio of peak serum concentration to mic90 (cmax/mic90) or a ratio of area under the curve to mic90 (auc/mic90) as a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (pk/pd) parameter, we estimated the efficacy  of the drug. an excellent effect of isp, which was injected intramuscularly or intravenously at a dose of 400 mg, was expected for strains of enterobacteriacea  except s. marcescens. the cmax/mic90 ratios for s. marcescens were comparably higher in gm and isp and that for p. aeruginosa were rather high in tob when compared to other aminoglycosides. another pk/pd parameter, auc/mic90 ratio, was  high enough in ntl and isp for enterobacteriacea, suggesting good efficacy of these drugs. the (auc/mic90) ratios for s. marcescens were comparably high in gm  and isp, and that for p. aeruginosa were high in tob, dkb, and isp.

AB  == we attempted to determine whether the same bacterium isolated from patients with  urinary tract infections (uti) before and after treatment with antimicrobial agents was of the same strain ("persisted") or of a different strain ("changed"). furthermore, to verify the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents for uti, we investigated whether bacterial strains could be classified as persisted or changed based on their electrophoretic patterns in pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). we examined eight species of bacteria ( enterococcus avium, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas fluorescens, serratia marcescens,  citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and escherichia coli), consisting of 41 strains (19 pairs isolated before and after treatment with antimicrobial agents) isolated from patients with complicated uti. it was concluded that all bacteria were unchanged, based on the clinical effect on bacteriuria. the chromosomal dna of these bacteria was digested with restriction enzymes and classified based on their electrophoretic pattern in pfge. a comparison of the patterns of the fragments revealed that 14 pairs were indistinguishable before and after treatment, 3 pairs were closely related, 1 pair was possibly related, and 1 pair was different. these results demonstrated that 18 pairs of isolates (indistinguishable, closely related, and possibly related) were highly likely to be continued infections by the same strain, and that 1 pair (different) had been replaced by another strain. based on these results, we believe that bacterium genotyping by pfge is a more effective method  for evaluating the antibacterial efficacy of antimicrobial agents.

TI  == resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds in food-related bacteria.
AB  == microbial resistance to antimicrobial agents continues to be a major problem. the frequent use and misuse of disinfectants based on quaternary ammonium compounds (qacs) in food-processing industries have imposed a selective pressure and may contribute to the emergence of disinfectant-resistant microorganisms. a total number of 1,325 gram-negative isolates (escherichia coli, other coliforms vibrio  spp., and aeromonas spp.) and 500 enterococcus spp. from food and food-processing industries and fish farming were screened for natural resistance to the qac-based disinfectant benzalkonium chloride (bc). of the 1,825 isolates, 16 strains, mainly from meat retail shops, showed low-level resistance to bc. none of the enterococcus spp. from broiler, cattle, and pigs, the antibiotic-resistant e. coli from pig intestine and fish pathogens vibrio spp. and aeromonas spp. from the norwegian fish farming industry were resistant to bc. the bc-resistant strains were examined for susceptibility to 15 different antibiotics, disinfectants, and dyes. no systematic cross-resistance between bc and any of the other antimicrobial agents tested was detected. stable enhanced resistance in enterobacter cloacae isolates was demonstrated by step-wise adaptation in increasing concentrations of bc. in conclusion, bc resistance among food-associated gram-negative bacteria and enterococcus spp. is not frequent, but resistance may develop to user concentrations after exposure to sublethal concentrations of bc.

AB  == the newly developed rapid lumi eiken/is60 (rl/is60) system automatically determines mics by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. the present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility  testing. chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with mics determined by the reference microdilution method. when the mics of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (qc) strains (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the rl/is60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the qc limits  proposed by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the system  was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including e. coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, p. aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae. overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the rl/is60 system and the reference microdilution method. our  results suggest that the rl/is60 system provides rapid and reliable mics of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as qc strains.

TI  == neonatal sepsis: high antibiotic resistance of the bacterial pathogens in a neonatal intensive care unit in karachi.
AB  == objective: to study the bacterial pathogens causing neonatal sepsis and their sensitivity pattern so that guidelines can be prepared for empirical antibiotic therapy. setting: the study was conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) at pns shifa (naval hospital), karachi during january 1997 to june 1999. methods: blood specimens for culture were drawn from 520 newborns admitted in a nicu with sepsis. the specimens were inoculated into brain heart infusion broth.  subcultures were performed on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10. the isolates were identified by standard biochemical tests. antibiotic resistance pattern of the isolates was studied by modified kirby baur disc diffusion technique. results: a  total of 212 organisms were isolated. these included staphylococcus aureus (n = 65), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 73), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 23), escherichia coli (n = 22), enterobacter cloacae (n = 18), citrobacter diversus (n = 5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4) and group b streptococcus (n = 2). on antibiotic sensitivity testing, 61.54% of staphylococcus aureus isolates were found to be methicillin resistant. susceptibility to the other common drugs was also quite low while 89.23% of these were susceptible to amikacin and 100% to vancomycin. more than 90% gram negative rods were resistant to ampicillin and co-trimoxazole. resistance to gentamicin was as high as 90.4% for klebsiella pneumoniae; 60.87% for acinetobacter baumannii. resistance to the third generation cephalosporins and the quinolone tested (ciprofloxacin) varied between 25-75%. majority of the isolates were susceptible to meropenem and amikacin. conclusion: in view of the isolation of highly antibiotic resistant organisms, vancomycin in combination with amikacin or a carbapenem is the drug of choice for empirically treating neonatal sepsis.

AB  == a spore-based biosensor for detecting low levels of bacteria in real-time has been recently developed. the system (termed lexsas, label-free exponential signal-amplification system) exploits spore's ability to produce fluorescence when sensing neighboring bacterial cells. we studied the lexsas as a possible approach for identifying bacterially contaminated platelet concentrates prior to  transfusion because the system offers rapid analysis, high sensitivity, and low cost. if successful, this approach could reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality from transfusion-related bacteremia and sepsis. in this study, we used  the lexsas for detecting bacteria in platelet concentrates spiked with bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, or streptococcus pyogenes. bacteria were separated from platelets using a 2-min procedure based on bacterial resistance to detergents and osmotic shock. the results indicate that the lexsas could be used to design a practical biosensor for identifying bacterially contaminated platelets in real-time.

TI  == regional occurrence of plasmid-mediated shv-7, an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, in enterobacter cloacae in philadelphia teaching hospitals.
AB  == although the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) by klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli is an emerging problem, limited data are available regarding the frequency of esbl production in other organisms. we provide the only description of regional occurrence of shv-7 in enterobacteriaceae other than e. coli or k. pneumoniae in the united states, and  we emphasize that, among enterobacter cloacae strains, not all resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is the result of hyperproduction of ampc beta-lactamase.

TI  == flavin thermodynamics explain the oxygen insensitivity of enteric nitroreductases.
AB  == bacterial nitroreductases are nad(p)h-dependent flavoenzymes which catalyze the oxygen-insensitive reduction of nitroaromatics, quinones, and riboflavin derivatives. despite their broad substrate specificity, their reactivity is very  specific for two-electron, not one-electron, chemistry. we now describe the thermodynamic properties of the flavin mononucleotide cofactor of enterobacter cloacae nitroreductase (nr), determined under a variety of solution conditions. the two-electron redox midpoint potential of nr is -190 mv at ph 7.0, and both the ph dependence of the midpoint potential and the optical spectrum of the reduced enzyme indicate that the transition is from neutral oxidized flavin to anionic flavin hydroquinone. the one-electron-reduced semiquinone states of both  the free enzyme and an nr-substrate analogue complex are strongly suppressed based on optical spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance measurements. this can explain the oxygen insensitivity of nr and its homologues, as it makes the execution of one-electron chemistry thermodynamically unfavorable. therefore, we have established a chemical basis for the recent finding that a nitroreductase is a member of the soxrs oxidative defense regulon in escherichia coli [liochev,  s. i., hausladen, a., fridovich, i. (1999) proc. natl. acad. sci. u.s.a. 96 (7),  3537-3539]. we also report binding affinities for the fmn cofactor in all three oxidation states either determined fluorometrically or calculated using thermodynamic cycles. thus, we provide a detailed picture of the thermodynamics underlying the unusual activity of nr.

TI  == pka, mm, and qm studies of mechanisms of beta-lactamases and penicillin-binding proteins: acylation step.
AB  == the acylation step of the catalytic mechanism of beta-lactamases and penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) has been studied with various approaches. the  methods applied range from molecular dynamics (md) simulations to multiple titration calculations using the poisson-boltzmann approach to quantum mechanical (qm) methods. the mechanism of class a beta-lactamases was investigated in the greatest detail. most approaches support the critical role of glu-166 and hydrolytic water in the acylation step of the enzymatic catalysis in class a beta-lactamases. the details of the catalytic mechanism have been revealed by the qm approach, which clearly pointed out the critical role of glu-166 acting as a general base in the acylation step with preferred substrates. lys-73 shuffles a proton abstracted by glu-166 o(epsilon ) to the beta-lactam nitrogen through ser-130 hydroxyl. this proton is transferred from o(gamma) of the catalytic ser-70 through the bridging hydrolytic water to glu-166 o(epsilon ). then the hydrogen is simultaneously passed through s(n)2 inversion mechanism at lys-73 n(zeta) to ser-130 o(gamma), which loses its proton to the beta-lactam nitrogen.  the protonation of beta-lactam nitrogen proceeds with an immediate ring opening and collapse of the first tetrahedral species into an acyl-enzyme intermediate. however, the studies that considered the effect of solvation lower the barrier for the pathway, which utilizes lys-73 as a general base, thus creating a possibility of multiple mechanisms for the acylation step in the class a beta-lactamases. these findings help explain the exceptional efficiency of these  enzymes. they emphasize an important role of glu-166, lys-73, and ser-130 for enzymatic catalysis and shed light on details of the acylation step of class a beta-lactamase mechanism. the acylation step for class c beta-lactamases and six  classes of pbps were also considered with continuum solvent models and md simulations.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of the beta-lactamase gene and surrounding dna sequences of citrobacter braakii, citrobacter murliniae, citrobacter werkmanii, escherichia fergusonii and enterobacter cancerogenus.
AB  == to further identify the origins of plasmid-mediated cephalosporinases that are currently spreading worldwide, the chromosomal beta-lactamase genes of citrobacter braakii, citrobacter murliniae, citrobacter werkmanii reference strains and of escherichia fergusonii and enterobacter cancerogenus clinical isolates were cloned and expressed into escherichia coli and sequenced. these beta-lactamases had all a single pi value >8 and conferred a typical ampc-type resistance pattern in e. coli recombinant strains. the cloned inserts obtained from genomic dnas of each strain encoded ambler class c beta-lactamases. the ampc-type enzymes of c. murliniae, c. braakii and c. werkmanii shared 99%, 96% and 95% amino acid sequence identity, respectively, with chromosomal ampc beta-lactamases from citrobacter freundii. the ampc-type enzyme of e. cancerogenus shared 85% amino acid sequence identity with the chromosomal ampc beta-lactamase of enterobacter cloacae oudhyp and the ampc-type enzyme of e. fergusonii shared 96% amino acid sequence identity with that of e. coli k12. the  ampc genes, except for e. fergusonii, were associated with genes homologous to regulatory ampr genes of other chromosomal class c beta-lactamases that explain inducibility of beta-lactamase expression in these strains. this work provides further evidence of the molecular heterogeneity of class c beta-lactamases.

TI  == cefcapene inactivates chromosome-encoded class c beta-lactamases.
AB  == the stability of cefcapene and cefpodoxime, oral antibacterial cephalosporins, toward different classes of beta-lactamases was evaluated. for the class a beta-lactamases, tem-1, shv-1, and nmc-a, only the steady-state kinetic parameter ( k(cat)/ km) values were calculated (3100 - 1.1 x 10(7) m(-1) x s(-1)), because  these enzymes have very high km values for cefpodoxime and cefotaxime. as for class b beta-lactamases l1, imp-1, and ccra, in general, similar k(cat)/ km values were obtained. however, regarding class c beta-lactamases from enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and citrobacter freundii, we found major differences in stability between the two compounds. cefpodoxime acted as a good substrate for the class c beta-lactamases, except for the enzyme from e. cloacae; its k(cat) and km values were successfully calculated ( k(cat)/ km, 1.8 x 10(5) - 1.2 x 10(7) m(-1) x s(-1)). on the other hand, cefcapene acted as a poor substrate or an inactivator for class c beta-lactamases; its k(2)/ k value was successfully calculated (8.7 x 10(5) - 7.0 x 10(6) m(-1) x s(-1)). in addition, k(3) values were determined for beta-lactamases from p. aeruginosa (2.3 x 10(-2) x s(-1)) and c. freundii (2.1 x  10(-1) x s(-1)). even though these values could be calculated, transient inactivation as an enzyme reactivation reaction for all these enzymes was observed. these findings suggest the potential of cephem compounds as inhibitors  of class c beta-lactamases.

TI  == structural requirements of the mrna for intracistronic translation initiation of  the enterobacterial infb gene.
AB  == background: the gene infb encodes the prokaryotic translation initiation factor if2, a central macromolecular component in the formation of the ribosomal 70s initiation complex. in escherichia coli, infb encodes three forms of if2: if2alpha, if2beta and if2gamma. the expression of if2beta and if2gamma is a tandem translation from intact infb mrna and not merely a translation of post-transcriptionally truncated mrna. the molecular mechanism responsible for the ribosomal recognition of the two intracistronic translation initiation sites  in e. coli infb is not well characterized. results: we found three different forms of if2 in enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, salmonella enterica, salmonella typhimurium, and two different forms in proteus vulgaris. we identified the intracistronic translation initiation sites of the mrna by isolation and n-terminal sequencing of the shorter isoforms of if2 in s. enterica and s. typhimurium. a further search in the readily available public sequence databases revealed that infb from yersinia pestis also contains an intracistronic in-frame initiation site used for the translation of if2beta. the base composition in a part of the 5' end of the dna coding strand of the enterobacterial infb gene shows a strong preference for adenine (a) over thymine  (t) with a maximum ratio of a-to-t around the intracistronic initiation sites. we demonstrate that the mrna has an open structure around the ribosomal binding region. conclusion: efficient intracistronic translation initiation of the infb gene is suggested to require an mrna with this special base composition that results in an open, single-stranded structure at the ribosomal binding region.

TI  == preassembly of membrane-active peptides is an important factor in their selectivity toward target cells.
AB  == membrane-active peptides comprise a large group of toxins used in the defense and offense systems of all organisms including plants and humans. they act on diverse targets including microorganisms and mammalian cells, but the factors that determine their target cell selectivity are not yet clear. here, we tested the role of peptide length and preassembly on the ability of diastereomeric cationic  antimicrobial peptides to discriminate among bacteria, erythrocytes, and fungal cells, by using peptides with variable lengths (13, 16, and 19 amino acids long)  and their covalently linked pentameric bundles. all the bundles expressed similar potent antifungal activity (minimal inhibitory concentration of 0.2-0.3 microm) and high antimicrobial activity. hemolytic activity was also observed at concentrations higher than those required for antifungal activity. in contrast, all the monomers showed length-dependent antimicrobial activity, were less active toward bacteria and fungi, and were devoid of hemolytic activity. biacore biosensor experiments revealed a approximately 300-fold increase in peptide-membrane binding affinity between the 13- and 19-residue monomers toward  zwitterionic (egg phosphatidylcholine (pc)/egg spingomyelin (sm)/cholesterol) vesicles. all the monomeric peptides display a similar high affinity to negatively charged (e. coli phosphatidylethanolamine (pe)/egg phosphatidylglycerol (pg)) vesicles regardless of their length. in contrast, irrespective of the size of the monomeric subunit, all the bundles bind irreversibly and strongly disrupt both pc/sm/cholesterol and pe/pg membranes. attenuated total reflectance fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that peptide assembly also affects structure as observed by an increased alpha-helical and beta-sheet content in membranes and enhances acyl chain disruption of pc/cholesterol. the correlation between the antibacterial activity  and ability to depolarize the transmembrane potential of e. coli spheroplasts, as well as the ability to induce calcein release from vesicles, suggests that the bacterial membrane is their target. the data demonstrate that preassembly of cationic diastereomeric antimicrobial peptides is an essential factor in their membrane targeting.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of bacterial organisms isolated from rats.
AB  == objective: to determine if antimicrobial resistance occurs in various bacterial species isolated from rats. method: two hundred and fifteen rats were trapped from areas in and around nairobi, kenya. they were sacrificed and their intestinal, liver and spleen specimens obtained. various bacterial species were isolated from these specimens. the species were analysed for antimicrobial susceptibility to 12 commonly used antimicrobials using the disc diffusion technique. results: the bacterial species isolated included pathogenic and potentially pathogenic ones such as escherichia coli 137, salmonella typhimurium  1, klebsiella pneumoniae 2, enterobacter cloacae 4, enterobacter sakazakii 2, citrobacter freundii 3, morganella morganii (2), pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 and burkhoddria cepacia 6. depending on the species, the resistance to the various antimicrobials were: 0-100% for cefotaxime, nalidixic acid, cefuroxime, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, co-amoxyclav, sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, trimethoprim and cephradine, 0-66.6% for gentamicin and 0-25% for apramycin. conclusion: the results showed that, rats from the study area harboured bacterial species with antimicrobial resistance. these micro-organisms may form an important reservoir for antibiotic resistance which could pose a public health hazard. control of rat populations, better management of sewer systems and waste  dumping sites are recommended in order to reduce occurrence of these drug resistance reservoirs.

TI  == prba, a gene coding for an esterase hydrolyzing parabens in enterobacter cloacae  and enterobacter gergoviae strains.
AB  == the new gene prba encodes an esterase responsible for the hydrolysis of the ester bond of parabens in enterobacter cloacae strain em. this gene is located on the chromosome of strain em and was cloned by several pcr approaches. the prba gene codes for an immature protein of 533 amino acids, the first 31 of which represent a proposed signal peptide yielding a mature protein of a putative molecular mass  of 54.6 kda. this enzyme presents analogies with other type b carboxylesterases,  mainly of eukaryotic origin. the cloning and expression of the prba gene in a strain of escherichia coli previously unable to hydrolyze parabens resulted in the acquisition of a hydrolytic capacity comparable to the original activity of strain em, along with an increased resistance of the transformed strain to methyl paraben. the presence of homologues of prba was tested in additional ubiquitous bacteria, which may be causative factors in opportunistic infections, including enterobacter gergoviae, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas agglomerans, e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and burkholderia cepacia. among the 41 total strains tested, 2 strains of e. gergoviae and 1 strain of burkholderia cepacia were able  to degrade almost completely 800 mg of methyl paraben liter(-1). two strains of e. gergoviae, named g1 and g12, contained a gene that showed high homology to the prba gene of e. cloacae and demonstrated comparable paraben esterase activities.  the significant geographical distance between the locations of the isolated e. cloacae and e. gergoviae strains suggests the possibility of an efficient transfer mechanism of the prba gene, conferring additional resistance to parabens in ubiquitous bacteria that represent a common source of opportunistic infections.

TI  == method for estimation of low outer membrane permeability to beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria plays a major role in beta-lactam resistance as it slows down antibiotic entry into the periplasm and therefore acts in synergy with beta-lactamases and efflux systems. up to now, the quantitative estimation of low outer membrane permeability by the method of zimmermann and rosselet was difficult because of the secreted and cell surface-associated beta-lactamases. the method presented here uses the acylation  of a highly sensitive periplasmic penicillin-binding protein (pbp) (blar-ctd) to  assess the rate of beta-lactam penetration into the periplasm. the method is dedicated to measurement of low permeability and is only valid when the diffusion rate through the outer membrane is rate limiting. cytoplasmic membrane associated pbps do not interfere since they are acylated after the very sensitive blar-ctd.  this method was used to measure the permeability of beta-lactamase-deficient strains of enterobacter cloacae and enterobacter aerogenes to benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cefotaxime, aztreonam, and cephacetrile. except for that of cephacetrile, the permeability coefficients were equal to or below 10(-7) cm/s. for cephacetrile, carbenicillin, and benzylpenicillin, the outer membrane of e. cloacae was 20 to 60 times less permeable than that of escherichia coli, whereas for cefotaxime, aztreonam, and ampicillin it was, respectively, 400, 1,000, and 700 times less permeable. the permeability coefficient for aztreonam is the lowest ever measured (p = 3.2 x 10(-9) cm/s). using these values, the mics for a beta-lactamase-overproducing strain of e. cloacae were successfully predicted, demonstrating the validity of the method.

TI  == mutation of rpia in enterobacter cloacae decreases seed and root colonization and biocontrol of damping-off caused by pythium ultimum on cucumber.
AB  == strains of enterobacter cloacae show promise as biocontrol agents for pythium ultimum-induced damping-off on cucumber and other crops. e. cloacae a145 is a mini-tn5 km transposon mutant of strain 501r3 that was significantly reduced in suppression of damping-off on cucumber caused by p. ultimum. strain a145 was deficient in colonization of cucumber, sunflower, and wheat seeds and significantly reduced in colonization of corn and cowpea seeds relative to strain 501r3. populations of strain a145 were also significantly lower than those of strain 501r3 at all sampling times in cucumber, wheat, and sunflower rhizosphere. populations of strain a145 were not detectable in any rhizosphere after 42 days,  while populations of strain 501r3 remained at substantial levels throughout all experiments. molecular characterization of strain a145 indicated mini-tn5 km was  inserted in a region of the e. cloacae genome with a high degree of dna and amino acid sequence similarity to rpia, which encodes ribose-5-phosphate isomerase. in  escherichia coli, rpia catalyzes the interconversion of ribose-5-phosphate and ribulose-5-phosphate and is a key enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway. ribose-5-phosphate isomerase activity in cell lysates from strain a145 was approximately 3.5% of that from strain 501r3. in addition, strain a145 was a ribose auxotroph, as expected for an rpia mutant. introduction of a 1.0-kb dna fragment containing only the rpia homologue into strain a145 restored ribose phosphate isomerase activity, prototrophy, seedling colonization, and disease suppression to levels similar to those associated with strain 501r3. experiments  reported here indicate a key role for rpia and possibly the pentose phosphate pathway in suppression of damping-off and colonization of subterranean portions of plants by e. cloacae.

AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the three most commonly used fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin) was measured for 2235 isolates of seven common pathogenic gram-negative bacteria. collected from a major teaching hospital in taiwan during the years 1985-86, 1989-90, and 1996-97, the samples were evaluated using the agar dilution method. the overall susceptibility to fluoroquinolones has decreased rapidly after the wide use of these antimicrobial agents. isolates of escherichia coli and morganella morganii  proved quite susceptible to the fluoroquinolones until 1996. by 1996-97, 20% of the bacteria had become resistant to the fluoroquinolones. activity against klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis remained excellent, however, with more than 90% of the isolates susceptible during the survey period. interestingly, some strains of serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa were demonstrating in vitro resistance even before the fluoroquinolones were launched in taiwan. this resistance increased rapidly, with around 20-30% of s. marcescens isolates fluoroquinolone-resistant by 1996-1997. after the introduction of the fluoroquinolones, resistance was demonstrated for about 15% of the p. aeruginosa isolates, and 20% of enterobacter cloacae isolates, with the susceptibility rate remaining steady state through the 1990s. different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns have been demonstrated for most fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates, suggesting that the increased resistance was  not due to the spread of a single clone. we conclude a trend of increasing fluoroquinolone resistance for many common gram-negative bacteria in taiwan, especially in recent years. appropriate use of the new fluoroquinolones should be encouraged in order to prevent the rapid emergence and increase of fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria.

AB  == polyclonal rabbit antibodies against shv-1 and cmy-2 beta-lactamases were produced and characterized, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisas) were  developed. immunoblots revealed that the anti-shv-1 antibody recognized shv-1 but did not recognize tem-1, k-1, oxa-1, or any ampc beta-lactamase tested. the anti-cmy-2 antibody detected escherichia coli cmy-2, enterobacter cloacae p99, klebsiella pneumoniae act-1, and the ampc beta-lactamases of enterobacter aerogenes, morganella morganii, and citrobacter freundii. no cross-reactivity of  the anti-cmy-2 antibody was seen against laboratory strains of e. coli possessing tem-1, shv-1, k-1, or oxa-1 beta-lactamases. operating conditions for performing  elisas were optimized. both anti-cmy-2 and anti-shv-1 antibodies detected picogram quantities of purified protein in elisas. the reactivity of the anti-cmy-2 antibody was tested against a number of ampc beta-lactamases by assaying known quantities of purified enzymes in elisas (ampc beta-lactamases of  m. morganii, c. freundii, e. coli, and e. cloacae). as the homology to cmy-2 beta-lactamase decreased, the minimum level needed for detection increased (e.g., 94% homology recognized at 1 ng/ml and 71% homology recognized at 10 ng/ml). the  elisas were used to assay unknown clinical isolates for ampc and shv beta-lactamases, and the results were confirmed with pcr amplification of bla(ampc) and bla(shv) genes. overall, we found that our elisas were at least 95% sensitive and specific for detecting shv and ampc beta-lactamases. the elisa format can facilitate the identification of ampc and shv beta-lactamases and can  be used to quantify relative amounts of beta-lactamase enzymes in clinical and laboratory isolates.

TI  == chromosomal ampc genes in enterobacter species other than enterobacter cloacae, and ancestral association of the act-1 plasmid-encoded cephalosporinase to enterobacter asburiae.
AB  == the amplification and sequence of ampc genes in enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter cancerogenus, enterobacter dissolvens, enterobacter hormaechei and enterobacter intermedius bring the number of known cephalosporinase sequences from the genus enterobacter to seven. expression in escherichia coli of the ampc  genes from e. asburiae, e. hormaechei and e. intermedius established the functional nature of these genes. ampc from e. asburiae shows 96.5% identity to bla(act-1) encoding a plasmid-borne cephalosporinase previously believed to derive from enterobacter cloacae. the reassignment of act-1 ancestry to e. asburiae is confirmed by the 95.5% identity between ampr upstream of bla(act-1) and ampr from e. asburiae.

TI  == ceftriaxone activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated in us clinical microbiology laboratories from 1996 to 2000: results from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa.
AB  == ceftriaxone was introduced into clinical practice in the usa in 1985 and was the  first extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporin approved for once-daily  treatment of patients with gram-positive or gram-negative infections. review of ceftriaxone activity is important given its continued use since the mid-1980s and reports of emerging resistance among all antimicrobial agent classes. we reviewed the activity of ceftriaxone and relevant comparative agents against five gram-positive and 11 gram-negative species for a 5-year period, 1996-2000, using  data from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa. all mic results were interpreted using nccls breakpoint criteria. ceftriaxone resistance among isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (n=17219) remained essentially unchanged over the 5 years studied and in fact was lower from 1998 to 2000 (5.0-5.1%) than  in 1996 (6.3%) and 1997 (6.6%). ceftriaxone resistance (range, 5.1-6.9%) among viridans group streptococci (n=6621) varied by <2% from 1997 to 2000. beta-lactam-resistant streptococcus pyogenes (n=935) and group b beta-haemolytic  streptococci (n=2267) were not identified in any year. among methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (n=39 284) ceftriaxone resistance was 0.1-0.3% per year from 1996 to 2000. ceftriaxone resistance among escherichia coli (n=472407; range, 0.2-0.4%), klebsiella oxytoca (n=16231; range, 3.5-4.8%),  klebsiella pneumoniae (n=117754; range, 1.9-2.6%), proteus mirabilis (n=67692; range, 0.2-0.3%), morganella morganii (n=11251; range, 0.3-2.1%) and serratia marcescens (n=26519; range, 1.6-3.8%) was low and consistent from 1996 to 2000. resistance to ceftriaxone among enterobacter cloacae (n=48114; range, 21.7-23.9%) was relatively high, compared with other enterobacteriaceae, but unchanged from 1996 to 2000. rates of resistance to ceftriaxone among acinetobacter spp. (n=20813) increased from 24.8% in 1996 to 45.1% in 2000. all haemophilus influenzae (n=7911) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (n=218) were susceptible to ceftriaxone, as were 99.7% of moraxella catarrhalis (n=312) tested in 1996 and 1997. in summary, ceftriaxone has retained its potent activity against the most commonly encountered gram-positive and gram-negative human pathogens despite widespread and ongoing clinical use for more than 15 years.

TI  == synthesis of new c-6 alkyliden penicillin derivatives as beta-lactamase inhibitors.
AB  == new penicillin, penicillin sulfone and sulfoxide derivatives bearing a c-6-alkyliden substituent were prepared. their chemical synthesis, in vitro antibacterial activity and inhibition properties against two selected enzymes representing class a and c beta-lactamases are reported. compounds 3a-c, 7a-c were able to inhibit either tem-1 (a class a enzyme, from escherichia coli) or p-99 (a class c enzyme, from e. cloacae), or both enzymes, when tested in competition experiments using nitrocefin as the reporter substrate. however, when tested in combination with amoxicillin, the same compounds did not show synergistic effects against e. coli and e. cloacae strains producing tem-1 and p99 enzymes, respectively. this finding is most likely related to poor penetration through the bacterial cell wall, as shown by using a more permeable isogenic e. coli strain. interestingly, a synergistic effect against a strain of  s. aureus which produces pc1-enzyme (a class a beta-lactamase) was observed for compound 3a when used in combination with amoxicillin.

TI  == jaundice as an early diagnostic sign of urinary tract infection in infancy.
AB  == objective: urinary tract infections (utis) are a common clinical problem in febrile infants younger than 8 weeks old, with a prevalence between 5% and 11%. previous studies have noted that jaundice may be one of the first signs of a bacterial infection in infants. our goal was to determine the incidence of utis in asymptomatic, jaundiced infants younger than 8 weeks old and to determine which historical and laboratory parameters are associated with utis. methods: we  prospectively evaluated asymptomatic, jaundiced infants younger than 8 weeks old  for evidence of a uti (defined as >10 000 colony-forming units per milliliter of  a single pathogen, obtained by bladder catheterization). a serum fractionated bilirubin level was obtained on all study patients. detailed questionnaires were  completed, which included demographic information, prenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal events. results: twelve (7.5%) of 160 infants had a uti (95% confidence interval: 3.9%-12.7%). isolated organisms included escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterococcus, klebsiella pneumoniae, group b streptococcus, streptococcus viridans, and staphylococcus aureus. patients with the onset of jaundice after 8 days of age had a higher incidence of uti, 6 (50%) of 12 infants in the positive culture group, versus 15 (10%) of 148 infants in the negative culture group. abnormal urinalysis and microscopy results were noted in 5 (42%) of 12 infants with a uti, and 6 (55%) of 11 infants had abnormal renal ultrasound results. conclusion: a uti was found in 7.5% of asymptomatic, afebrile, jaundiced infants younger than 8 weeks old. in addition, infants with the onset of jaundice after 8 days of age or patients with an elevated conjugated bilirubin fraction were more likely to have a uti. therefore, we recommend that testing for a uti be included as part of the evaluation in asymptomatic, jaundiced infants presenting  to the emergency department.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. changes in czop susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), escherichia coli (n = 276), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), enterobacter  aerogenes (n = 93), serratia marcescens (n = 172), serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), citrobacter freundii (n = 177), citrobacter koseri (n = 70), proteus mirabilis (n = 113), proteus vulgaris (n = 89), morganella morganii (n = 116), providencia spp. (n = 41), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), pseudomonas putida (n = 63), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and prevotella/porphyromonas (n = 173). an antibacterial activity of czop against e.  coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and s. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against m.(b.) catarrhalis, c. koseri, and p. aeruginosa  was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and p. mirabilis increased year by year. the increase in mic90 of czop against e. aerogenes and p. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. in contract, the susceptibility of e. cloacae  to czop was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to czop. mic90 of czop against c. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. additionally, mic90 of czop against h. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little  higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. an antibacterial activity of czop against p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. cepacia, s.  maltophilia, b. fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. changes in mic90 of czop against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.

TI  == transient reduction in the trna 4-thiouridine content induced by ultraviolet a during post-irradiation growth in enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == the influence of previous exposure to ultraviolet-a radiation (uva) was studied on the susceptibility of enterobacter cloacae to undergo the growth delay effect. comparison of growth curves corresponding to irradiated and control cells showed  that a previous treatment with uva almost abolished the growth delay effect. uv absorption spectra of trna, and reverse phase hplc analysis of hydrolysed trna, demonstrated a low content of 4-thiouridine in e. cloacae cells grown after uva exposure at low doses. since 4-thiouridine is the uva target responsible for initiation of growth delay, this observation explained the influence of previous  exposure to uva on the susceptibility of this organism to undergo growth delay. a similar but weaker alteration was found when escherichia coli was assayed. the results suggest that, in addition to cross-linking with cytidine residues, the content of 4-thiouridine in trna may be modified by uva by an unknown mechanism.

TI  == nb2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  == enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ecta) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. we present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ecta compounds, nb2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of nb2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) nb2001 is a substrate for tem-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/k(m)) of greater than 77,000 m-1 s-1. (ii) triclosan is detected in nb2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli but not in e. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) nb2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing e. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. nb2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae. nb2001 is also active against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae.  the results indicate that nb2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent  and demonstrate the potential of ecta in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.

TI  == tem-80, a novel inhibitor-resistant beta-lactamase in a clinical isolate of enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == enterobacter cloacae ecl261 was isolated with escherichia coli ec257 from the urine of a patient living in a nursing home. both isolates were resistant to ticarcillin (mics, 1,024 microg/ml), without significant potentiation of its activity by 2 microg of clavulanate per ml (mics, 512 microg/ml), and susceptible to naturally active cephalosporins. this inhibitor-resistant phenotype was conferred in both strains by similar conjugative plasmids of 40 kb (ecl261) and 30 kb (ec257), which also conveyed resistance to sulfonamides and trimethoprim. clinical and transconjugant strains produced a beta-lactamase with a pi of 5.2 which belonged to the tem family, as indicated by specific pcr amplification. compared with tem-1, this enzyme exhibited lower catalytic efficiencies (14- and  120-fold less for amoxicillin and ticarcillin, respectively), and higher concentrations of beta-lactamase inhibitors were required to yield a 50% reduction in benzylpenicillin hydrolysis (750-, 82-, and 50-fold higher concentrations for clavulanate, sulbactam, and tazobactam, respectively). gene sequencing revealed four nucleotide differences with the nucleotide sequence of bla(tem-1a). the first replacement (t32c), located in the promoter region, was described as being responsible for the increase in the level of beta-lactamase production. the three other changes led to amino acid substitutions that define a new inhibitor-resistant tem (irt) beta-lactamase, tem-80 (alternate name, irt-24). two of them, met69leu and asn276asp, have previously been related to inhibitor resistance. the additional mutation, ile127val, was demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis to have a very weak effect, at least alone, on the irt  phenotype. this is the first description of an irt beta-lactamase in e. cloacae.  the horizontal transfer of bla(tem-80) may have occurred either from ec257 to ecl261 or in the reverse order.

TI  == [can we rely on the results of urine microscopy and culture when tests are performed in general practice?].
AB  == introduction: urinary tract infections (uti) account for 2-5% of consultations in general practice, but only about half the patients with dysuria have significant  bacteriuria (> 100,000 bacteria per ml). a microbiological diagnosis can be made  by examination of a urine sample, and in danish family practice the diagnosis of  uti is often reached by a microscopic analysis or a dip-slide culture test. these methods have a high validity when performed in hospital, but we need knowledge about the validity of microbiological urine examinations when performed in general practice. the aim of this study was to validate detection of bacteriuria  by urine microscopy and dip-slide culture in general practice. material and methods: urine specimens artificially produced by adding a known quantity of bacteria (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis) to sterile urine were sent  to 25 general practices for microscopic examination and dip-slide culture. no prior instruction in testing procedure was given. as the gold standard, the results of a standardised culture method performed by skilled laboratory technicians at the department of microbiology, university of southern denmark, were used. results: significant bacteriuria was identified by microscopy with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 83%. the corresponding figures for urine  culture were 95% and 96%. the morphology of bacteria was interpreted correctly in 80% of microscopic examinations, and 60% of the bacteria strains were classified  correctly in terms of their motility. discussion: the results of urine microscopy and culture performed in general practice are to be relied on.

AB  == the mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance in two isolates of enterobacter cloacae, ecl#1 and ecl#2, from the same patient and with identical pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns, have been analysed. mics of ciprofloxacin were 0.25 and 1 mg/l for ecl#1 and ecl#2, respectively. ecl#2 was also more resistant to chloramphenicol and organic solvents. the quinolone resistance determining regions of gyra/b and parc/e, and the marora and acrb genes, were sequenced. expression of marr, acrb, soxs, roba, rama and fis was analysed by northern blotting. the activity of a 90 bp e. cloacae mar promoter fragment was examined with the reporter plasmid pigj-1mar. sequencing the gyrab and parce genes revealed a single amino acid substitution in gyra (corresponding to position 83 in gyra of escherichia coli) in ecl#1 and ecl#2 (phe83) compared with reference strain e. cloacae dsmz 3264 (thr83). ecl#2 accumulated significantly less norfloxacin and displayed higher levels of expression of marr and acrb than exl#1, indicative of greater fluoroquinolone efflux activity. sequencing gyrb, parc/e and marora, and northern blotting of roba, rama and fis, did not reveal any further differences between the two strains. no homologue of soxrs was detected in e. cloacae. expression of gfp from pigj1-mar in ecl#2 was higher than in ecl#1. in these two closely related clinical isolates of e. cloacae, a target  mutation in gyra (ecl#1 and ecl#2) and increased fluoroquinolone efflux by acrab  (ecl#2) contribute to the resistance phenotypes, corroborating findings in vitro  and in vivo about the sequential development of fluoroquinolone resistance.

AB  == susceptibility data were collected for 6243 gram-negative isolates from 29 european icus participating in the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) programme (1997-2000). the most commonly isolated bacteria were pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.5%), escherichia coli (19.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (10.4%), and enterobacter cloacae (7.7%). the incidence of  extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producers was higher in turkish, russian and italian icus (27.9-39.6%) than in other countries (2.5-10.8%). the frequency of ampc-cephalosporin hyper-producers was 16.8-55.4%. meropenem was more active against proteus mirabilis than imipenem (99.0% versus 88.8% susceptibility, respectively). against acinetobacter baumannii, meropenem (79.6% susceptible) and imipenem (82.2%) were more active than comparators (34.3-51.6%). meropenem and imipenem exhibited good activity against p. aeruginosa (76.1% and 68.2%, respectively; but with inter-country variation). ciprofloxacin resistance in e. coli and k. pneumoniae increased and needs close monitoring. meropenem (98.2-99.8% susceptibility) and imipenem (88.8-99.4%) remained potent against important species of gram-negative bacteria from european icus actively using meropenem.

AB  == aims: isolates from various samples obtained during 1998 and 1999 were identified and their susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins, monobactams and/or cephamycins studied along with any production of esbls. methods and results: of these samples, bacteria most frequently isolated by the conventional techniques and vitek gni card were escherichia coli (37%), klebsiella pneumoniae (27%) and enterobacter cloacae (16%). using disk diffusion and double-disk synergy tests, we found that 71% strains produced esbls and 18% strains produced esbls and cephamycinases. banding patterns of pcr amplification with the designed primers showed that 57% strains were capable of harbouring bla(shv) genes. the bla(tem),  bla(cmy) and bla(ampc) genes were harboured by 55%, 31% and 12% strains, respectively. forty-five percent of strains contained more than two types of beta-lactamase genes. in particular, one strain contained bla(tem), bla(shv), bla(cmy) and bla(ampc) genes. conclusions: the percentage of esbl-producing strains was high. the most prevalent beta-lactamase gene was bla(shv) gene. the bla(cmy) genes have been prevalent in cephamycin-resistant strains. the multidrug-resistant strains resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and cephamycins were detected in high percentage. significance and impact of the study: resistance mechanisms to beta-lactams, comprising mostly extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production, lead to the resistance against even recently developed beta-lactams in enterobacteria, which is now a serious threat to antibiotic therapy. the high prevalence of bla(cmy) genes and multidrug-resistant genes may also cause therapeutic failure and lack of eradication of these strains by third-generation cephalosporins or cephamycins.

TI  == mechanisms of quinolone resistance in clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == objective: to study and evaluate changes in the gyra gene and the outer-membrane  protein patterns in relation to evolution of resistance against the quinolones in enterobacter cloacae. methods: strains expressing gyra-mediated quinolone resistance become susceptible to quinolones upon insertion of the plasmid pnjr3-2. this plasmid (containing wild-type escherichia coli quinolone-susceptible dna gyrase a subunits) and pla2917 (the vector) were introduced into 10 resistant or moderately susceptible clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae by conjugation. the transconjugants, the original isolates,  the plasmid and the vector control were screened for susceptibility to ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin. additionally, examinations of the outer-membrane  proteins were performed. results: a reduction of mics by a factor of 8--32 was found for the transconjugants of five enterobacter cloacae isolates in the presence of the gene probe, suggesting that these isolates harbored mutations in  gyra. no discernible difference in the patterns of outer-membrane proteins of sensitive and resistant strains could be detected. conclusions: it seems that changes in the target site such as alterations in gyra are important factors leading to a change in the susceptibility of bacteria to the quinolones, whereas  there were no evident changes in the outer-membrane proteins to account for evolution of resistance.

AB  == of 15 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing isolates of the family enterobacteriaceae collected from the first municipal people's hospital of guangzhou, in the southern part of the people's republic of china, 9 were found to produce ctx-m esbls, 3 produced shv-12, and 3 produced both ctx-m and shv-12.  eleven isolates produced either tem-1b or shv-11, in addition to an esbl. nucleotide sequence analysis of the 12 isolates carrying bla(ctx-m) genes revealed that they harbored three different bla(ctx-m) genes, bla(ctx-m-9) (5 isolates), bla(ctx-m-13) (1 isolate), and bla(ctx-m-14) (6 isolates). these genes have 98% nucleotide homology with bla(toho-2). the bla(ctx-m) genes were carried  on plasmids that ranged in size from 35 to 150 kb. plasmid fingerprints and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed the dissemination of the bla(ctx-m) genes through transfer of different antibiotic resistance plasmids to different bacteria, suggesting that these resistance determinants are highly mobile. insertion sequence isecp1, found on the upstream region of these genes, may be involved in the translocation of the bla(ctx-m) genes. this is the first report of the occurrence of shv-12 and ctx-m esbls in china. the presence of strains with these esbls shows both the evolution of bla(ctx-m) genes and their dissemination among at least three species of the family enterobacteriaceae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae, isolated within a single hospital. the predominance of ctx-m type enzymes seen in this area of china appears to be similar to that seen in south america but is different from those seen in europe and north america, suggesting different evolutionary routes and selective pressures. a more comprehensive survey of the esbl types from china is urgently needed.

AB  == the antibiotic susceptibility of members of the family enterobacteriaceae and of  staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from the respiratory tract was assessed over the period 1997-1999 as part of the italian epidemiological observatory survey sponsored by the smith-kline foundation. a standardised method was used to determine the mics of 22 antibiotics against isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae (n=870), escherichia coli (n=684), enterobacter cloacae (n=342), enterobacter aerogenes (n=187) and serratia marcescens (n=135) as well as the mics of 11 antibiotics against isolates of staphylococcus aureus (n=1,606). overall, the susceptibility rate of enterobacteriaceae isolates was > or = 90% to 5 agents (meropenem, imipenem, amikacin, cefepime and gentamicin); 89-80% to 2 agents (ciprofloxacin and tobramycin); and <80% to 11 agents (cefotaxime, piperacillin-tazobactam, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cefetamet, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, aztreonam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, tetracycline, piperacillin, cefuroxime, chloramphenicol, ticarcillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate and amoxicillin). during the 3-year monitoring period, antibiotic susceptibility increased in klebsiella pneumoniae against amoxicillin-clavulanate, in escherichia coli against third-generation cephalosporins and aztreonam, in enterobacter aerogenes against amoxicillin and piperacillin-tazobactam and in serratia marcescens against most of the antibiotics. in contrast, enterobacter cloacae showed a tendency to develop resistance to cefetamet, amikacin and ciprofloxacin. of the total number of staphylococcus aureus strains, 38% were methicillin resistant. nearly 80% of the methicillin-resistant strains displayed  a multiresistance pattern (additional resistance to 2 or more non-beta-lactam antibiotics). rates of susceptibility of particular species (klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus) were compared using strains  from different geographical areas of italy (northern, central and southern) and from different nosocomial areas (outpatients, intensive care unit [icu] inpatients, non-icu inpatients). susceptibility of klebsiella pneumoniae to several antibiotics was lower in southern italy, whereas the incidence of methicillin-resistant strains was higher in northern and central italy. the susceptibility of escherichia coli was similar in all three areas. no significant differences in susceptibility of klebsiella pneumoniae or escherichia coli were found between strains from inpatients and outpatients or from inpatients admitted to icu and non-icu units. the incidence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was higher in icu inpatients (52%) than in non-icu inpatients (38%) and lower in outpatients (19%) than in inpatients.

TI  == isolation and characterization of an unusual 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (acc) deaminase gene from enterobacter cloacae uw4.
AB  == a genomic library of the 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (acc) deaminase-containing plant growth-promoting bacterium enterobacter cloacae uw4 in puc19 in escherichia coli was screened for the ability to utilize acc as a sole source of nitrogen. one of the clones that was isolated contained a plasmid with  an insert of approximately 0.8 kb that conferred acc deaminase activity. sequence analysis revealed that this dna fragment contains an open-reading frame of 696 nucleotides predicted to encode a protein of 232 amino acids, a member of the amidohydrolase protein superfamily, i.e., a deaminase that contains a mononuclear or binuclear metal center as compared to the canonical acc deaminase which contains pyridoxal phosphate as a co-factor.

TI  == multicenter surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of major bacterial pathogens in intensive care units in 2000 in taiwan.
AB  == a susceptibility surveillance study of 1,274 bacterial isolates recovered from various clinical specimens from patients in intensive care units (icus) of five major teaching hospitals was carried out from march, 2000, to june, 2000, in taiwan. this study demonstrated a high rate (66%) of oxacillin resistance in staphylococcus aureus (orsa), a high rate of nonsusceptibility to penicillin (intermediate, 50% and highly resistant, 8%), and high rates of cefotaxime nonsusceptibility for s. pneumoniae (intermediate, 29% and resistant, 4%), enterobacter cloacae (57%), serratia marcescens (34%), and citrobacter freundii (60%). high rate of ceftazidime nonsusceptibility for pseudomonas aeruginosa (22%), and high rates of imipenem nonsusceptibility for p. aeruginosa (15%) and acinetobacter baumannii (22%) were also found. the percentage (11.9%) of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli was greater than that (11.3%) for klebsiella pneumoniae. rates of quinupristin-dalfopristin nonsusceptibility for s. pneumoniae (42%), enterococcus faecium (71%), and orsa (39%) were high, but no vancomycin-resistant enterococci were found in this study. the resistance rates of some pathogen varied by institution or type of icus. surveillance for antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens in hospitals, particularly in icu settings with a preexisting higher resistance burden, is mandatory in establishing and/or modifying guidelines for empirical treatment of severe infections in icu patients caused by these antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.

TI  == susceptibility to fluoroquinolones among commonly isolated gram-negative bacilli  in 2000: trust and tsn data for the united states. tracking resistance in the united states today. the surveillance network.
AB  == from january to may 2000, as part of the tracking resistance in the united states today (trust) surveillance initiative, clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae (n=2519) and non-fermentative gram-negatives (n=580) were prospectively collected from 26 hospital laboratories across the united states. isolates were tested for  susceptibility to three fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin) and seven other agents. in addition, data for the same period were  collected from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa, an electronic surveillance network that receives data from more than 200 laboratories in the us. both surveillance methods produced similar results. against isolates of enterobacteriaceae, imipenem was the most active agent, followed by the fluoroquinolones; > or = 86.7% of isolates of all species of enterobacteriaceae except providencia spp. were susceptible to fluoroquinolones by trust and tsn surveillance. trust identified differences in susceptibility to the three fluoroquinolones of > or = 2% for citrobacter spp., enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis and serratia marcescens. isolates of p. mirabilis were considerably more susceptible to levofloxacin (94.0%) than to ciprofloxacin (87.7%) and gatifloxacin (87.7%). other results from trust included pseudomonas aeruginosa being slightly more susceptible to ciprofloxacin (73.5%) and levofloxacin (73.0%) than gatifloxacin (71.0%). imipenem was the only compound with significant activity (95.1% susceptible, trust; 87.4% susceptible, tsn) against acinetobacter baumannii, but it was inactive against stenotrophomonas maltophilia. s. maltophilia isolates were more susceptible to levofloxacin and gatifloxacin (77.7-79.8%) than ciprofloxacin (29.7-33.0%). against 513 urinary isolates of escherichia coli in trust, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin were equipotent. age and gender had no clear effect on the activity of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin or gatifloxacin. similar results for all three fluoroquinolones were seen in outpatients and inpatients. trust and tsn data indicated that resistance rates had not changed appreciably for any compound studied since a similar study conducted in 1999. trust centralized in vitro and electronic (tsn)  surveillance methods provided an effective strategy for monitoring trends in resistance.

TI  == in-vitro antibacterial activities of cefpiramide and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against 440 clinical isolates in china.
AB  == the in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefpiramide was compared with those of 15  other broad-spectrum cephalosporins. a total of 440 clinical strains of bacteria, including 9 bacterial species, were isolated from our hospital in 1998. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefpiramide and five other antibiotics were determined for each species, using the agar-dilution method. the mic of cefpiramide for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae was higher than those of three other third-generation cephalosporins, (ie, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone). fifty-one percent (26/51) of enterobacter cloacae  isolates were resistant to cefpiramide. cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime had greater activity against e. cloacae (resistance, 3.9% and 19.6%, respectively) than cefpiramide. cefpiramide was more active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (resistance rates, 12%) than cefoperazone, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, aztreonam, and cefepime. cefpiramide-resistant p. aeruginosa strains were resistant to ceftazidime, but 27% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were susceptible to cefpiramide; 15.3% of cefpiramide-resistant s. maltophilia strains were also susceptible to ceftazidime, but 50% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were still susceptible to cefpiramide. cefoperazone/sulbactam was the most active agent against acinetobacter baumannii, showing a resistance rate of 2%. ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftazidime, and cefpiramide were the second most active agents, and about 50% of the tested strains were susceptible to these three antibiotics. cefpiramide had an activity comparable to that of all tested beta-lactams against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 2 microg/ml). against streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, cefpiramide had good activity, with an mic90 concentration at which 90% of the strain was inhibited of 1 microg/ml and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. these results indicated that cefpiramide was more active against glucose non-fermenting bacteria than against enterobacteriaceae, and was very active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylo-coccus aureus, s. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae. thus, cefpiramide may be a good choice of drug for the treatment of patients with infections with glucose non-fermenting bacteria and community acquired infections.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity and penetration rate into sputum of gatifloxacin, a novel 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone, and its therapeutic efficacy in respiratory infections.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin against clinical isolates of  pathogenic bacteria was evaluated. minimum inhibitory concentrations of gatifloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and rifampicin against 20 strains each of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18 strains of enterobacter cloacae, 15 strains each of streptococcus pneumoniae and moraxella catarrhalis, 12 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 18 strains of mycobacterium intracellulare, and 22 strains each of mycobacterium tuberculosis and mycobacterium avium were determined. the minimum inhibitory concentrations90's of gatifloxacin against the above species were 0.12, 8, <==0.06, 0.5, 2, 2, <==0.06, 0.39, 0.05, 0.013, 2, 0.5, and 4 &mgr;g/ml, respectively. gatifloxacin was four times as active as ofloxacin against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, and as active as ofloxacin against enterobacteriaceae and  pseudomonas aeruginosa. gatifloxacin was as active as tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin against streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae. the antimycobacterial activity of gatifloxacin was similar to that of sparfloxacin. five patients with chronic respiratory infections and one patient with acute pneumonia received 100-400 mg/day of gatifloxacin orally for 5-12 days (mean, 8.17 days). the clinical effects were excellent in one patient and good in five. one strain of haemophilus influenzae was eradicated and one strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa persisted after therapy.  adverse reactions were mild and improved after completion of therapy. in one patient with chronic bronchitis, the maximum sputum concentrations 2-4 h after oral administration of 150 mg of gatifloxacin on days 1 and 6 were 0.88 and 1.45  &mgr;g/ml, respectively, and in serum the values were 0.84 and 1.24 &mgr;g/ml, respectively. thus it was found that gatifloxacin possesses potent activity against respiratory pathogens (including mycobacteriaceae), and shows good penetration rate into sputum, and that it can be used as the drug of first choice in the treatment of respiratory tract infections.

TI  == development of a thin tube cultivation method for determining coliform counts in  milk.
AB  == a new rapid coliform-monitoring method using thin tube cultivation (ttc) was developed. one hundred microliters of modified selective medium (1.5% agar) and 100 microl of sample were mixed in thin cultivation tubes, yielding a semisolid mixture of 0.75% agar. the tubes were incubated at 37 degrees c and checked for a positive reaction (gas production from lactose fermentation and color changes from acid production) at 30-min intervals. the positive reaction times for ttc were compared with actual coliform numbers. the first experiment was performed to validate the ttc method using pure coliform cultures (the escherichia coli group, the enterobacter cloacae group. and the klebsiella pneumoniae group). the results indicated that the ttc method saved about 10 to 14 h of incubation time compared  with the conventional plating method. when coliforms were present in small numbers, such as i to 1.5 log10 cfu/ml, the ttc method detected their presence within 10 h. when highly contaminated samples were assayed (6 log10 cfu/ml), the  ttc method detected the presence of coliforms within 4 to 5 h. in a food system experiment, pasteurized skim milk inoculated with a coliform mixture was assayed  by the ttc method. the coliforms in the milk were quickly detected, resulting in  a savings of 11 to 14 h compared with the conventional plating method. cold-injured coliforms were studied to evaluate the ttc system. the recovery and  estimation of injured coliforms by the ttc method strongly agree with those of the conventional plating method. the ttc system was also applied to ascertain the levels of natural coliforms in noninoculated milk. the ttc system reduced incubation times by about 11 to 14 h compared with the conventional plating method. according to these data, this method is a rapid, simple, accurate, and economical way to monitor and estimate total coliforms in milk.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. special references to bacteria isolated between april 1998  and march 1999].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained in fiscal 1998 (from april 1998 to march 1999). the number of cases investigated as objectives was 225 for one year. a total of 429 strains (121 strains from primary infections and 308 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 183 cases (81.3% of total cases). in primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes and escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of gram-positive aerobes and pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. on the whole, among gram-positive aerobes, the isolation rate of enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by staphylococcus aureus with high frequency in isolation from  postoperative infections. among gram-positive anaerobes, peptostreptococcus spp.  and streptococcus spp. were predominantly isolated. among gram-negative aerobes,  e. coli, p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae were frequently isolated. among gram-negative anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates. in primary infections, the percentage of gram-negative aerobes has gradually increased since fiscal 1995 or 1996 with these years as the turning point, while those of gram-positive and gram-negative  anaerobes have gradually declined. in postoperative infections, the percentage of gram-negative anaerobes has increased continuously since the mid-1980s. the percentage of mrsa among s. aureus rose to 89.7%, which was the highest level since the beginning of this study. the susceptibilities of b. fragilis, which did not show apparent changes, were recognized to have decreased against cephems in fiscal 1998. among other bacteria in b. fragilis group, development of resistance to cephems has continued on a long-term basis since the mid-1980s. e. coli and k. pneuminiae have obviously not changed in susceptibilities, however, the susceptibilities of isolated strains in fiscal 1998 against high-generation cephems, oxacephems and monobactams have declined. we found neither vancomycin-resistant nor teicoplanin-resistant strains of s. aureus and enterococcus spp.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibilities among clinical isolates of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacteria in a taiwanese university hospital.
AB  == infections caused by gram-negative bacteria with resistance to extended-spectrum  cephalosporins require the identification of effective alternative antimicrobial  therapy. to determine the role of other pre-existing or currently available antimicrobial agents in treating infections caused by these multidrug-resistant pathogens, we evaluated the in vitro susceptibilities of these agents in 411 non-duplicate isolates of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacteria recovered between january 1999 and december 1999 in a major teaching hospital in taipei, taiwan. these isolates included cefotaxime-resistant (mics >  or = 2 mg/l) escherichia coli (66 isolates) and klebsiella pneumoniae (77 isolates); cefotaxime-resistant (mics > or = 64 mg/l) enterobacter cloacae (59 isolates), serratia marcescens (52 isolates) and citrobacter freundii (52 isolates); and ceftazidime-resistant (mics > or = 64 mg/l) pseudomonas aeruginosa (50 isolates) and acinetobacter baumannii (55 isolates). overall, carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem) had good activity against the cefotaxime-resistant enterobacteriaceae tested (>90% of isolates were susceptible). however, carbapenems had limited activity against the ceftazidime-resistant p. aeruginosa  (only 4% of isolates were susceptible) and a. baumannii (51-56% of isolates were  susceptible). among the e. coli and k. pneumoniae isolates tested, 33.3% and 58.4%, respectively, exhibited extended-spectrum beta-lactamase phenotype, determined by the double disc method. over 80% of cefotaxime-resistant e. cloacae and c. freundii were susceptible to cefepime, but this agent had limited activity against other bacteria tested. susceptibilities of these isolates to ciprofloxacin varied, ranging from 25% for a. baumannii to 92% for e. cloacae. newer fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin) had equal or less activity against these organisms, except for a. baumannii for which their mic(90)s (8-16 mg/l) were four- to 16-fold less than that of ciprofloxacin (mic(90) 128 mg/l).

AB  == the thermal profiles of 118 bacterial strains, representing six species of the family enterobacteriaceae, isolated from a variety of native australian mammals were determined under in vitro conditions. each of the bacterial species had a unique thermal profile and differed in their minimum or maximum temperature for growth and in their response to changing temperatures. the taxonomic classification of the host from which the bacterial strains were isolated explained a significant amount of the variation in thermal profile among strains  of a species. host effects were detected at all taxonomic levels: order, family,  genus, and species. the locality (state or territory) or climate zone from which  the strain was collected explained a significant amount of the variation in the thermal profile of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae strains. genetically similar strains, as determined by allozyme profiles, had similar thermal profiles for the bacterial species hafnia alvei and escherichia coli. the results of this study indicate that there are potentially many aspects of host biology that may determine the thermal profile of these bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides isolated from skin secretions of the diploid frog, xenopus tropicalis (pipidae).
AB  == seven peptides (xt-1-xt-7) with antimicrobial activity were isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the diploid clawed frog, xenopus tropicalis. structural characterization of the peptides demonstrated that amino acid sequence similarity to antimicrobial peptides previously isolated from xenopus laevis was low, suggesting that the species are not closely related phylogenetically. peptides xt-5 and xt-3 are probably the orthologs of x. laevis  peptide glycine-leucine amide (pgl(a)) and the n-terminal spacer region of prolevitide, respectively. xt-1, xt-6 and xt-7 show limited structural similarity to the spacer region of x. laevis procaeruleins and the paralogs xt-2 and xt-4 are similar to corresponding regions of proxenopsin. orthologs of the magainins were not identified. the c-terminally alpha-amidated peptide xt-7 (gllgpllkiaakvgsnll.nh2) showed the lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations against reference microorganisms (staphylococcus aureus 5 microm, escherichia coli 5 microm, and candida albicans 40 microm) and was also active against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus group c, shigella sonnei, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae. the peptide was, however, hemolytic against  human erythrocytes (50% lysis at 70 microm). circular dichroism studies showed that xt-7 has a random structure in aqueous solution, ph 7.0 but adopts an alpha-helical conformation in the presence of 50% trifluoroethanol. decreasing the cationicity of xt-7 either by replacement of the c-terminal conh2 group by cooh or by deletion of the lys(8) residue produced analogs with greatly (>10-fold) decreased antimicrobial potencies.

TI  == trends in quinolone susceptibility of enterobacteriaceae among inpatients of a large university hospital: 1992-98.
AB  == objectives: to assess trends in quinolone susceptibility of enterobacteriaceae isolated in a large university hospital. methods: between 1992 and 1998, bacterial isolates were collected each year during a 3-month period to evaluate annual changes in susceptibility. in addition, the activities of fluoroquinolones (pefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin) against nalidixic acid-resistant strains were determined by disk diffusion and mic methodologies during the first and last year of the study. results: the susceptibility of enterobacteriaceae to nalidixic acid was unchanged between 1992 and 1998 (86% versus 85%). however, at the species level, the susceptibility rates to nalidixic acid decreased for escherichia coli from 92% to 89%, and for enterobacter cloacae from 87% to 82%. in contrast, there was a 10% increase in the nalidixic acid susceptibility rates for klebsiella pneumoniae (74% versus 83%), which was thought to be due to the control of the spread of epidemic extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strains. the overall susceptibility of the enterobacteriaceae to the fluoroquinolones remained high during the study period, greater than 90% in the case of ciprofloxacin. however, nalidixic acid-resistant  escherichia coli showed decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin between 1992 and 1998, as reflected by a decrease in median zone diameter (26 mm to 19 mm), an increase in mic(50) (0.25 mg/l to 1 mg/l) and a shift in mic distribution (unimodal in 1992 to bimodal in 1998). this has resulted in the reduced susceptibility of escherichia coli to fluoroquinolones between 1992 and 1998 (pefloxacin, 95-90%; ciprofloxacin, 99-95%). conclusions: the susceptibility of escherichia coli to quinolones has decreased, and the level of susceptibility of  the resistant strains has increased over the 7-year study period.

TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. a total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the national taiwan university hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. for many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. some strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum  inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. moxifloxacin was less active against p. aeruginosa, but was more active against s. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. the drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in taiwan.

AB  == the value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the fundacion favaloro, the fundacion para la lucha contra las enfermedades neurologicas de la infancia and the hospital de ninos ricardo gutierrez. a total  of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). bact-alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees c for 30 days in the bact-alert system. bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and sabouraud agar. a total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. the positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). the median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. the microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), escherichia coli (n = 18), acinetobacter spp (n = 9), candida spp (n = 8), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), enterococcus faecalis, salmonella spp and capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecium, citrobacter diversus, candida albicans, klebsiella oxytoca, chryseomonas luteola, serratia marcescens, abiotrophia spp, campylobacter jejuni, moraxella catarrhalis, moraxella urethralis, neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group g streptococci, rhodococcus equi, micrococcus spp, cryptococcus neoformans  and streptococcus mitis (n = 1). in our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.

TI  == the efficacy of chemical agents in cleaning and disinfection programs.
AB  == background: due to the growing number of outbreaks of infection in hospital nurseries, it becomes essential to set up a sanitation program that indicates that the appropriate chemical agent was chosen for application in the most effective way. method: for the purpose of evaluating the efficacy of a chemical agent, the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was reached by the classic method of successive broth dilutions. the reference bacteria utilized were bacillus subtilis var. globigii atcc 9372, bacillus stearothermophilus atcc 7953, escherichia coli atcc 25922, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923. the strains of enterobacter cloacae ial 1976 (adolfo lutz institute), serratia marcescens ial 1478 and acinetobactev calcoaceticus ial 124 (atcc 19606), were isolated from material collected from babies involved in outbreaks of infection in hospital nurseries. results: the mic intervals, which reduced bacteria populations over 08 log10, were: 59 to 156 mg/l of quaternarium ammonium compounds (qacs); 63 to 10000 mg/l of chlorhexidine digluconate; 1375 to 3250 mg/l of glutaraldehyde; 39  to 246 mg/l of formaldehyde; 43750 to 87500 mg/l of isopropanol or ethanol; 1250  to 6250 mg/l of iodine in polyvinyl-pyrolidone complexes, 150 to 4491 mg/l of chlorine-releasing-agents (cras); 469 to 2500 mg/l of hydrogen peroxide; and, 2310 to 18500 mg/l of peracetic acid. conclusions: chlorhexidine showed non inhibitory activity over germinating spores. a. calcoaceticus, was observed to show resistance to the majority of the agents tested, followed by e. cloacae and  s. marcescens.

TI  == blood components influence cytokine induction by bacterial substances.
AB  == while some studies clearly demonstrated transfer of cytokine-inducing substances  (cis) through dialysis membranes, other authors were unable to reproduce such a transfer. this inconsistency may have been caused by marked differences in experimental design. we performed a systematic evaluation of cytokine induction in whole blood and from separated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) using either purified lipopolysaccharide (lps) or culture supernatants from various bacterial strains. an in vitro hemodialysis circuit with whole blood in the blood compartment was employed; the dialysate was contaminated with sterile filtrates from pseudomonas aeruginosa cultures. addition of plasma samples from the blood side to pbmc readily induced interleukin (il)-1beta and il-6 after contamination  of the dialysate, while the same samples failed to induce cytokine production in  whole blood. in experiments using direct incubation, purified p. aeruginosa lps induced more il-1beta and il-6 in whole blood compared to pbmc. in contrast, bacterial filtrates from escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and especially p. aeruginosa induced significantly less cytokines in whole blood compared to pbmc.  addition of erythrocytes but not granulocytes decreased cytokine induction by bacterial filtrates as well as by lps, probably by adsorption of these substances. the addition of 30% plasma increased cytokine induction by lps but decreased cytokine induction by p. aeruginosas filtrates. our results suggest that cellular and plasmatic components of whole blood interact with bacterial cis altering their pyrogenic activity. the detection of cis depends on the test system used; whole blood cultures are not as sensitive for the detection of cis from bacterial filtrates as pbmc cultures.

TI  == sublethal effects of ultraviolet a radiation on enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == we report the sublethal effects of ultraviolet a (uva) on enterobacter cloacae in comparison with those produced in escherichia coli. uva-induced sublethal effects were investigated in either bacterial membrane and at trna level. limited dependence on oxygen concentration for photoinduced inhibition of biochemical membrane functions and low levels of oxidative damage during the irradiation period were found in en. cloacae. on the other hand, ultraviolet spectroscopy and reversed-phase hplc analysis of hydrolysed trna showed that radio induced damage  to trna is similar in en. cloacae and e. coli. nevertheless, growth delay induced by uva in en. cloacae was shorter than that found in e. coli submitted to the same experimental conditions. a limited post-irradiation ppgpp accumulation and the absence of any influence of the membrane damage on the growth delay extent seem to be responsible for the shortness of this effect in en. cloacae. most of the differences between en. cloacae and e. coli could be attributed to an increased ability of en. cloacae to overcome oxidative stress during uva exposure.

TI  == bacteriological quality of aquacultured freshwater fish portions in prepackaged trays stored at 3 degrees c.
AB  == fresh trout fillets and salmon slices packed in trays were obtained from two multinational chain supermarkets and evaluated for freshness and bacteriological  quality immediately after packaging and during storage at 3 degrees c. initial aerobic counts at 30 and 25 degrees c were significantly (p < 0.05) lower in trout fillets (5.27 +/- 0.57 and 4.87 +/- 0.80 log cfu/g, respectively) than in salmon slices, where levels in excess of 6 log cfu/g were found. in both products, initial enterobacteriaceae counts were slightly higher than 3 log cfu/g and increased significantly during shelf life by approximately 3 log cfu/g. most  of the enterobacteria were identified as citrobacter freundii, hafnia alvei, and  enterobacter cloacae. on day 0, most probable number (mpn) counts of total and fecal coliforms were not significantly different, numbers of the latter group being approximately 4 mpn/g. escherichia coli was only detected when fish was spoiled. although initial presumptive staphylococcus aureus counts were approximately 3 log cfu/g, only 4 of 84 selected colonies belonged to this species. neither salmonella nor antimicrobial residues were detected in any sample. ethanol content in salmon slices did not significantly (p > 0.05) increase until they became inedible. significant correlation (r = +0.72, p < 0.05) was observed between this chemical index and viable counts at 30 degrees c  only when salmon slices were inedible. trout fillets were acceptable for 7 days,  and salmon slices showed signs of spoilage after 4 days. although public health concerns associated with packed trout and salmon appear to be minimal, data on sensory quality, shelf life, and total viable and enterobacteriaceae counts strongly suggest the need to improve the quality control systems used by european multinational retailers, especially for imported salmon.

TI  == ampd is required for regulation of expression of nmca, a carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase of enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == to further elucidate the induction process of the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase of ambler class a, nmca, ampd genes of the wild-type (wt) strain and of ceftazidime-resistant mutants of enterobacter cloacae nor-1 were cloned and tested in transcomplementation experiments. ceftazidime-resistant e. cloacae  nor-1 mutants exhibited derepressed expression of the ampc-type cephalosporinase  and of the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase nmca. the ampd genes of escherichia coli and e. cloacae wt nor-1 transcomplemented the ceftazidime-resistant e. cloacae nor-1 mutants to the wt level of beta-lactamase  expression, while the mutated ampd alleles of e. cloacae nor-1 failed to do so. the deduced e. cloacae nor-1 wt ampd protein exhibited 95 and 91% amino acid identity with the e. cloacae o29 and e. cloacae 14 wt ampd proteins, respectively. of the 12 ceftazidime-resistant e. cloacae nor-1 strains, 3 had ampd proteins with amino acid changes, while the others had truncated ampd proteins. most of these mutations were located outside the conserved regions that link the ampd proteins to the cell wall hydrolases. ampd from e. cloacae nor-1 is involved in the regulation of expression of both beta-lactamases (nmca and ampc), suggesting that structurally unrelated genes may be under the control of an identical genetic system.

TI  == bacterial cholangitis in patients with biliary atresia: impact on short-term outcome.
AB  == bacterial cholangitis (bc) is a common complication in patients with biliary atresia (ba) and is characterized by fever, acholic stools and positive blood cultures. the diagnosis is often empirical because the yield of blood cultures is low. it is difficult to differentiate bc from other febrile episodes. in order to characterize the clinical and laboratory features of bc in patients with ba, identify risk factors, and correlate cholangitis with outcome, 37 patients with ba from 1993 to 1998 who underwent a kasai operation in our hospital were studied. the follow-up period ranged from 6 to 59 months. a total of 107 febrile  episodes were documented in these patients. the diagnostic criteria for cholangitis were fever, increased jaundice, or acholic stools. the clinical features, laboratory data, results of bacterial cultures, and outcomes were analyzed retrospectively. a total of 107 febrile episodes, including 78 bouts of  cholangitis and 29 non-cholangitis infections, were found in 34 patients. patients with bc had higher postoperative bilirubin levels (p = 0.02) and less frequent use of prophylactic antibiotics (p = 0.05) than those with non-cholangitis infections. abnormal white blood cell counts (> 12,000 or <4,000  mm3) tended to be present in patients with bc (p = 0.08). there were no statistical differences in the risk factors and laboratory data between culture-positive (n = 16) and -negative (n = 62) cholangitis cases. the occurrence of cholangitis significantly reduced survival in both patients with good (p = 0.03) and inadequate bile flow (p = 0.03). all 9 patients who had never had cholangitis survived during the follow-up period. repeated attacks of bc further decreased survival probability. the responsive organisms were mainly enteric bacteria, including escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumanni, and salmonella typhi. the sensitivity tests justified empirical therapy with ceftriaxone. the effectiveness of prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or neomycin warrants  further studies. bc was a highly prevalent postoperative complication in patients with ba, especially those with inadequate bile drainage. it significantly affected early mortality. aggressive and complete treatment with empirical ceftriaxone was appropriate.

TI  == multi-resistance to antimicrobial agents for the ten most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens.
AB  == cross-resistance and multi-resistance to selected antibiotics was determined for  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. amikacin-resistant enterobacteriaceae often showed cross-resistance  to ss-lactam antibiotics. only 1% of the escherichia coli isolates showed resistance to more than four antibiotics from a set of seven. this rate was higher for other enterobacteriaceae and there were high levels of cross-resistance for p. aeruginosa. the cross-resistance of oxacillin with other  antibiotics is well known in staphylococci. penicillin-resistant pneumococcal isolates were cross-resistant to macrolides. cross-resistance was only a minor problem in h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis. cross- and multi-resistance are important problems for gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria but not for fastidious bacteria with the exception of penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae.

AB  == a series of specific alpha-ketoheterocycles (benzoxazole, thiazole, imidazole, tetrazole, and thiazole-4-carboxylate) has been synthesized in order to assess their potential as beta-lactamase inhibitors. the syntheses were achieved either  by construction of the heterocycle (benzoxazole) from an appropriate alpha-hydroxyimidate, followed by oxidation of the alcohol, or by direct reaction of methyl phenaceturate with a lithiated heterocycle. the properties of these compounds in aqueous solution are described and their inhibitory activity against beta-lactamases assessed. they did inhibit the class c beta-lactamase of enterobacter cloacae p99 but not the tem beta-lactamase. the most effective inhibitor of the former enzyme (k(i)=0.11 mm) was 5-(phenylacetylglycyl) tetrazole, probably because it is an anion at neutral ph. interpretation of the results was aided by computational models of the tetrahedral adducts. most of the compounds also inhibited alpha-chymotrypsin but not porcine pancreatic elastase.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of argon fluoride (arf) excimer laser on gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of argon fluoride (arf) excimer laser radiation on clinically important strains of gram-negative bacteria. the antibacterial activity of arf excimer laser radiation was evaluated on two acinetobacter baumannii, one enterobacter cloacae, three escherichia coli, two helicobacter pylori, one klebsiella pneumoniae and two pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. the strains were isolated from clinical specimens and typed by the usual biochemical procedures. square agar plates of 12 x 12 cm were divided into rectangular (2 x 3 cm) regions and spread with 0.5x 10(4) colony forming units (cfu)/ml of bacterial suspension. the excess liquid was removed and the plates were allowed to dry for 30 min. a total of 96 rectangular  (2x3 cm) regions were used for each strain, in order to test an equal number of laser parameters. each rectangular region was irradiated with different laser parameters, using a 193 nm arf excimer laser, linked with a simple galilean afocal system and a rectangular diaphragm of the same dimensions as the original  laser beam cross-section, at a distance of 10 cm from the irradiated surface. this system was used in order to keep the laser pulse energy under 80 mj and to cut-out the non-transverse electromagnetic mode branches of the laser beam. we then studied the bacterial survival ratio versus the number of laser pulses, the  repetition frequency and the total laser beam fluence. our results showed that the total laser beam fluence was the most important parameter to consider in evaluating the bactericidal effect of arf excimer laser radiation. a critical value of the total fluence was determined for each strain, such that, for laser beam fluences greater than this critical value, no colonies appeared to survive while, for laser fluences less than this critical value, the survival ratio did not exceed 2 x 10(7) cfu (2 x 10(-5)%). these critical values were found to vary  between 8 j/cm2 and 16 j/cm2 for the bacterial species studied. under these conditions, arf laser irradiation is promising for the sterilisation of hard surfaces and for in situ application.

TI  == further studies on rpos in enterobacteria: identification of rpos in enterobacter cloacae and kluyvera cryocrescens.
AB  == rpos, the alternative sigma factor sigma(s), is important for bacterial survival  under extreme conditions. many enterobacteria are opportunistic human pathogens and their ability to survive in a changing environment could be an essential step for their virulence. to determine the presence of this gene in enteric bacteria,  an escherichia coli rpos probe was constructed and used to detect the presence of this gene in different species. a gene homologous to rpos was found in citrobacter amalonaticus, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella planticola, kluyvera cryocrescens, serratia rubidaea, shigella sonnei, and yersinia ruckeri. providencia stuartii and proteus vulgaris were the only tested enterobacteria that did not show any signal with the e. coli rpos probe or that did not lead to  amplification of an rpos fragment using specific primers. the rpos gene from e. cloacae and from k. cryocrescens was cloned and sequenced and a mutant allele was constructed in e. cloacae. survival rates under different harsh conditions were followed in order to determine the effect of rpos inactivation in exponential- and stationary-phase cells of both strains. e. cloacae rpos mutants were more sensitive to extreme ph, high osmolarity, and high temperature than the wild-type.

AB  == objectives: to identify the microflora in the gallbladder of patients undergoing  laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstones, and the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of the isolates, as well as the usefulness of gram staining of bile at the time of operation. methods: bile samples were obtained from 112 patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstones and inoculated directly into aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles in the operating theatre. samples were also collected in sterile universal containers for gram staining of a centrifuged deposit. isolates were identified and their in-vitro susceptibilities determined by kirby bauer technique. results: of 112 bile samples examined, 28 (25%) were culture positive, four of which contained more than one organism. the most common organisms isolated were escherichia coli 9 (28.1%), enterococcus faecalis 5 (15.6%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa 3 (9.4%). in  one sample we found aeromonas hydrophilia and enterobacter cloacae. no anaerobes  were detected but candida albicans was isolated in one case. in 19 bile samples (67.8%) organisms were identified on gram stain. positive bile cultures were found statistically significant (p < 0.05) in patients over the age of 50 (13/32), in patients who developed post-operative fever (6/12) and patients who developed leucocytosis (5/6). conclusion: age over 50 years was the only significant pre-operative factor associated with positive bile cultures (p < 0.05). in view of the microflora of the gallbladder and the susceptibility pattern of our isolates we would suggest that antibiotic prophylaxis recommended  for laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstones needs to be reviewed and the role of bacteribilia in the surgical management of cholelithiasis requires further study.

TI  == nosocomial necrotising enterocolitis outbreaks: epidemiology and control measures.
AB  == necrotising enterocolitis (nec) is one of the most serious gastrointestinal diseases among newborns and it mainly affects those in intensive care units. the  aetiology of the disease has been reported to be multifactorial and both sporadic cases and nosocomial outbreaks have occurred. in this report, we review 17 epidemics of nec reported in the literature between 1973 and 1999. the number of  confirmed cases ranged from 1 to 32 with an average of 10.5 confirmed cases. on average, 16.15% of cases required surgery (range 0-66.6%). the average mortality  rate was 6.25% (range 0-87.5%). the mean age at disease onset was 9.5 days (range 6.6-29 days). most of the infants had low birth weight (median weight 1,395 g; range 1,112-2,788 g, calculated on the reported mean weights). the main risk factors associated with nec were: low birth weight, low gestational age, low apgar score, perinatal complications, hyaline membrane disease, and umbilical catheterisation. the bacteria involved often included enterobacteriaceae, particularly escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae type 3305573. the causative role of clostridia in nec is controversial. with regard to viral agents, coronarovirus, rotavirus and enterovirus, such as echovirus type 22, were isolated during some of the epidemics. the recommended control measures for nec epidemics are those used for epidemics of other orofaecally transmitted infections. conclusion: understanding the epidemiology of necrotising enterocolitis is fundamental if adequate preventive control measures  are to be developed and applied.

AB  == based on dna sequence analysis and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (acc) deaminase activity, the region of dna immediately upstream of the enterobacter cloacae uw4 acc deaminase gene (acds) contains several features that appear to be involved in its transcriptional regulation. in the present study, the 5' upstream region of acds was cloned into the promoter-probe vector, pqf70, which carries the promoterless luciferase gene (luxab), and luciferase expression was monitored. the data obtained from studying the expression of the luciferase gene  showed that (i) a leucine responsive regulatory protein (lrp)-like protein encoded within the upstream region is located on the opposite strand from acds under the control of a promoter stronger than the one responsible for acds transcription, (ii) luciferase gene expression required both acc and the lrp-like protein, (iii) luciferase expression was increased three-fold under anaerobic conditions, consistent with the involvement of a fumarate-nitrate reduction (fnr)-like regulatory protein box within the upstream region, and (iv) the addition of leucine to the growth medium decreased luciferase activity in the presence of acc and increased luciferase activity in the absence of acc, consistent with leucine acting as a regulator of the expression of the lrp-like protein.

TI  == antibiotic selective pressure and development of bacterial resistance.
AB  == this study evaluates the development of resistance in gram-negative rods to cefotaxime and ceftazidime, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and amikacin, meropenem and ampicillin/sulbactam over a five year period of use (1994-1998) at  the university hospital in olomouc, czech republic. the development of bacterial  resistance was linked with antibiotic use and hence selective pressure which was  specific for the type of antibiotic and the bacterial species. statistically significant correlations were found for the use of ofloxacin and resistance in escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris and providencia rettgeri; cefotaxime and enterobacter cloacae; ceftazidime and acinetobacter spp., enterobacter agglomerans and proteus vulgaris; and gentamicin and proteus mirabilis.

TI  == [activity of cefepime compared with other antibiotics against major hospital bacterial pathogens].
AB  == the aim of the study was to evaluate susceptibility of 976 bacterial isolates from nosocomial infections to cefepime and 9 other antibiotics used in the treatment of hospitalised patients. bacterial strains were mainly derived from wound and soft tissue infections, sputum, abscesses and blood. the most prevalent etiologic agents were: pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.7%), escherichia coli (13.8%),  staphyloccocus aureus (9.7%, acinetobacter baumannii (9.12%), klebsiella pneumoniae (7.38%), enterobacter cloacae (5.6%). the most susceptible to cefepime were strains of k. pneumoniae (98.62%), e. coli (98.52%) and e. cloacae (98.19%)  including those producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases. the degree of susceptibility to cefepime was equal to that of imipenem. a. baumannii was the least susceptible species (67.42%). this study indicate that cefepime may play an important role in therapy of nosocomial infections in particular caused by enterobacteriace.

TI  == h(2)o(2) produced by viridans group streptococci may contribute to inhibition of  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus colonization of oral cavities in newborns.
AB  == in an accompanying report, we showed that viridans group streptococci may prevent methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) colonization of the oral cavities of newborns. in the present study, we investigated the mechanism of prevention in vitro. most viridans group streptococci had bacteriocin-like activity and killed mrsa, burkholderia cepacia, enterobacter aerogenes, and pseudomonas aeruginosa; however, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, and candida albicans were resistant. the activity was induced only by h(2)o(2)-secreting strains and was inhibited by horseradish peroxidase or catalase in a dose-dependent manner. the mean concentration of h(2)o(2) produced  by 18 strains of viridans group streptococci (1 x 10(8) cfu in 200 microl of culture medium+/-standard deviation was 1.24+/-0.60 mmol. viridans group streptococci inhibited mrsa growth in saliva as well as in culture media. these results indicate that h(2)o(2) produced by viridans group streptococci may inhibit mrsa colonization of oral cavities in newborns.

TI  == evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

TI  == probiotic activities of lactobacillus casei rhamnosus: in vitro adherence to intestinal cells and antimicrobial properties.
AB  == the interest of probiotics as remedies for a broad number of gastrointestinal and other infectious diseases has gained wide interest over the last few years, but little is known about their underlying mechanism of action. in this study, the probiotic activities of a human isolate of lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus strain (lcr35) were investigated. using intestinal caco-2 cell line in an in vitro model, we demonstrated that this strain exhibited adhesive properties. the  inhibitory effects of lcr35 organisms on the adherence of three pathogens, enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) and klebsiella pneumoniae, were determined. a decrease in the number of adhering pathogens was observed, using either preincubation, postincubation or coincubation of the pathogens with lcr35. moreover, the antibacterial activities  of cell-free lcr35 supernatant was examined against nine human pathogenic bacteria, etec, epec, k. pneumoniae, shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and clostridium difficile. the growth of all strains was inhibited, as measured by determining the number of viable bacteria over time, but no bactericidal activity was detected in this in vitro assay. together, these findings suggest that this probiotic strain could be used to prevent colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by a large variety of pathogens.

TI  == identification of a non-haem catalase in salmonella and its regulation by rpos (sigmas).
AB  == we report the identification and functional analysis of katn, a gene encoding a non-haem catalase of salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium. katn, which is not present in escherichia coli, is located between the ycigfe and ycid e. coli homologues in the salmonella genome. its predicted protein product has a molecular weight of 31 826 da and is similar to the mn-catalases of lactobacillus plantarum and thermus spp. its product, katn, was visualized as a 37 kda protein  in e. coli maxicells. a katn recombinant protein, containing six histidine residues at its c-terminus, was purified, and its catalase activity was observed  on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. katn was also visualized by catalase activity gel staining of bacterial cell extracts. its expression was shown to be  regulated by growth phase and rpos. northern blotting indicated that kat forms an operon with the upstream ycigfe genes. a putative rpos-regulated promoter was identified upstream of ycig. southern blotting revealed that katn is conserved within salmonella serovars. katn homologues were found in pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens. a katn mutation did not appear to affect the hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) response of salmonella. however, the expression of katn increased the h2o2 resistance of unadapted cells in the exponential phase and of rpos mutants in stationary phase. thus, katn may contribute to hydrogen peroxide resistance in salmonella in certain environmental conditions.

TI  == interaction of bladder glycoprotein gp51 with uropathogenic bacteria.
AB  == purpose: a major component of bladder surface mucin is a glycoprotein gp51 (molecular weight 51 kd.). gp51, which has previously been isolated from rabbit mucosa, appears to function as part of the defense mechanism in an in vivo infection model. gp51 coats the epithelium and is secreted into the urine, as detected by immunohistochemical testing and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). increased urinary gp51 occurs during urinary tract infection. to elucidate the role of gp51 as a component of the primary defense mechanism we studied interactions with uropathogenic bacterial isolates and urine from symptomatic patients with urinary tract infection. materials and methods: elisa was performed to demonstrate the binding of gp51 and various uropathogens. immunochemical studies were done using monoclonal antibodies to gp51 to determine the interaction of gp51 with certain uropathogenic isolates, including escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and streptococcus faecalis. infected urinary sediments and uropathogenic bacterial cultures were examined by immunocytochemical testing to localize gp51. antigen inhibition elisa was done to quantitate urinary gp51 in the urine of 17 normal controls and 19 patients with urinary tract infection. results: elisa revealed that gp51 binds to a wide spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative uropathogens in semiquantitative fashion. immunochemical methods confirmed that purified gp51 binds to bacteria, encapsulating and aggregating the bacteria. clinical specimens showed gp51 localized to bacteria and uroepithelial  cells. we observed a significant increase in urinary gp51 in urinary tract infection compared to uninfected urine (p = 0.0003). conclusions: these studies suggest that gp51, a component of bladder mucin, may be a strategic factor in the primary defense mechanism of the bladder.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolone photodegradation products determined by parallel-line bioassay and high performance liquid chromatography.
AB  == the fluoroquinolones produce multiple photodegradation products. little is known  about these products, particularly whether any possess antimicrobial activity. to investigate this, we used the parallel-line bioassay to investigate discrepancies in zone of inhibition size in conjunction with high performance liquid chromatography (hplc) analysis. a continuous flow photochemical reaction unit ('beam-boost') was used to partially photodegrade the fluoroquinolones ofloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin (0.02 mm) by between 15 and 89%, as  confirmed by hplc. the concentration of residual parent fluoroquinolone in each irradiated sample was measured by hplc and a non-irradiated control solution was  prepared at the same concentration. these were compared by parallel-line bioassays using escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca. with ofloxacin and levofloxacin, the zone size for the control solution was significantly less than that of the irradiated solutions, with >15% photodegradation in at least two of the indicator organisms, indicating that the  photodegradation products possess antimicrobial activity. no difference was seen  with ciprofloxacin at any level of photodegradation with any of the indicator organisms, nor with moxifloxacin at 30 and 54% photodegradation. a significant difference was observed with e. cloacae only, at 83% photodegradation.

TI  == phenotypic resistance of staphylococcus aureus, selected enterobacteriaceae, and  pseudomonas aeruginosa after single and multiple in vitro exposures to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and trovafloxacin.
AB  == the phenotypic resistance of selected organisms to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and trovafloxacin was defined as a mic of > or =4 microg/ml. the dynamics of resistance were studied after single and sequential drug exposures: clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mssa and mrsa), escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were utilized. after a single 48-h exposure of a large inoculum to four times the initial mic for the organism, the frequency of selection of resistant mutants of mssa was greater for trovafloxacin than levofloxacin (p = 0.008); for e. cloacae, the frequency was highest for ciprofloxacin and lowest for levofloxacin and trovafloxacin; for s. marcescens, the frequency was highest for trovafloxacin and lowest for ciprofloxacin (p = 0.003). the results of serial passage experiments were analyzed both by the kaplan-meier product-limited method as well as by analysis of variance of mean inhibitory values. by both methods, mssa and mrsa expressed mutants resistant to ciprofloxacin after fewer passages than were required for either levofloxacin or trovafloxacin. for the aerobic gram-negative bacilli, two  general patterns emerged. mutants resistant to trovafloxacin appeared sooner and  reached higher mean mics than did mutants resistant to levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. mutants resistant to ciprofloxacin appeared later and reached mean mics lower than the mics of the other two drugs studied. even though individual strain variation occurred, the mean mics were reproduced when the serial passage  experiment was repeated using an identical panel of e. coli isolates. in summary, the dynamic selection of fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria can be demonstrated in experiments that employ serial passage of bacteria in vitro.

TI  == extension of resistance to cefepime and cefpirome associated to a six amino acid  deletion in the h-10 helix of the cephalosporinase of an enterobacter cloacae clinical isolate.
AB  == enterobacter cloacae che, a clinical strain with overproduced cephalosporinase was found to be highly resistant to the new cephalosporins, cefepime and cefpirome (mics> or =128 microg ml(-1)). the strain was isolated from a child previously treated with cefepime. the catalytic efficiency of the purified enzyme with the third-generation cephalosporins, cefepime and cefpirome, was 10 times higher than that with the e. cloacae p99 enzyme. this was mostly due to a decrease in k(m) for these beta-lactams. the clinical isolate produced large amounts of the cephalosporinase because introduction of the ampd gene decreased ampc expression and partially restored the wild-type phenotype. indeed, mics of cefepime and cefpirome remained 10 times higher than those for a stable derepressed clinical isolate (oudhyp) transformed with an ampd gene. sequencing of the ampc gene showed that 18 nucleotides had been deleted, corresponding to the six amino acids skvala (residues 289--294). according to the crystal structure of p99 beta-lactamase, this deletion was located in the h-10 helix. the ampr-ampc genes from the clinical isolates che and oudhyp were cloned and expressed in escherichia coli jm101. the mics of cefpirome and cefepime of e. coli harboring ampc and ampr genes from che were 100--200 times higher than those of e. coli harboring ampc and ampr genes from oudhyp. this suggests that the deletion, confirmed by sequencing of the ampc gene, is involved in resistance to  cefepime and cefpirome. however, the high level of resistance to cefepime and cefpirome observed in the e. cloacae clinical isolate was due to a combination of hyperproduction of the ampc beta-lactamase and structural modification of the enzyme. this is the first example of an ampc variant conferring resistance to cefepime and cefpirome, isolated as a clinical strain.

TI  == antimicrobial properties and mode of action of the pyrrothine holomycin.
AB  == holomycin, a member of the pyrrothine class of antibiotics, displayed broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, inhibiting a variety of gram-positive and  gram-negative bacteria, with the exception of enterobacter cloacae, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the antibiotic lacked activity against the  eukaryotic microorganisms saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida kefyr. holomycin exhibited a bacteriostatic response against escherichia coli that was associated  with rapid inhibition of rna synthesis in whole cells. inhibition of rna synthesis could have been a secondary consequence of inhibiting trna aminoacylation, thereby inducing the stringent response. however, the levels of inhibition of rna synthesis by holomycin were similar in a stringent and relaxed  pair of e. coli strains that were isogenic except for the deletion of the rela gene. this suggests that inhibition of rna synthesis by holomycin could reflect direct inhibition of dna-dependent rna polymerase. examination of the effects of  holomycin on the kinetics of the appearance of beta-galactosidase in induced e. coli cells was also consistent with inhibition of rna polymerase at the level of  rna chain elongation. however, holomycin only weakly inhibited e. coli rna polymerase in assays using synthetic poly(da-dt) and plasmid templates. furthermore, inhibition of rna polymerase was observed only at holomycin concentrations in excess of those required to inhibit the growth of e. coli. it is possible that holomycin is a prodrug, requiring conversion in the cell to an active species that inhibits rna polymerase.

AB  == analysis of the dna sequence upstream of the previously isolated enterobacter cloacae uw4 acc deaminase gene (shah et al. 1998) suggests that this segment contains several features that are thought to be involved in the transcriptional  regulation of this gene. these features include half of a crp (camp receptor protein) binding site, an fnr (fumarate-nitrate reduction) regulatory protein binding site, an lrp (leucine responsive regulatory protein) binding site, and an lrp-like protein coding region. acc deaminase activity was measured following growth of either various escherichia coli strains carrying a plasmid that contained the enterobacter cloacae uw4 acc deaminase gene, or of enterobacter cloacae uw4. variables that were compared include aerobic versus anaerobic conditions, the presence and absence of acc in the growth medium, addition of leucine to the medium, and bacterial strains that did or did not contain either lrp or fnr genes. the data reported are consistent with the involvement of most,  if not all, of the above mentioned potential regulatory regions in the expression of acc deaminase.

AB  == the rpoh regulatory region of different members of the enteric bacteria family was sequenced or downloaded from genbank and compared. in addition, the transcriptional start sites of rpoh of yersinia frederiksenii and proteus mirabilis, two distant members of this family, were determined. sequences similar to the sigma(70) promoters p1, p4 and p5, to the sigma(e) promoter p3 and to boxes dnaa1, dnaa2, camp receptor protein (crp) boxes crp1, crp2 and box cytr present in escherichia coli k12, were identified in sequences of closely related  bacteria such as: e.coli, shigella flexneri, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae. in more distant bacteria, y.frederiksenii and p.mirabilis, the rpoh regulatory region has a distal p1-like sigma(70) promoter and two proximal promoters: a heat-induced sigma(e)-like promoter and a sigma(70) promoter. sequences similar to the regulatory boxes were not identified in these bacteria.  this study suggests that the general pattern of transcription of the rpoh gene in enteric bacteria includes a distal sigma(70) promoter, >200 nt upstream of the initiation codon, and two proximal promoters: a heat-induced sigma(e)-like promoter and a sigma(70) promoter. a second proximal sigma(70) promoter under catabolite-regulation is probably present only in bacteria closely related to e.coli.

AB  == the focus of this study was to evaluate the microbial quality of spanish potato omelette and cooked meat samples including pork loin, chicken croquettes, long pork sausage, chicken breast, and meatballs from university restaurants. microbiological analyses of spanish potato omelette and cooked meat samples resulted in aerobic plate counts from <1.00 to 2.90 and from <1.00 to 6.04 log10  cfu g(-1), respectively. total coliforms ranged from <3 to 43 most probable number (mpn) g(-1) and from <3 to >2,400 mpn g(-1) for spanish potato omelette and meat products, respectively. escherichia coli, coagulase-positive staphylococci, and lancefield group-d streptococci were detected in 1.7%, 3.5%, and 12.9% of spanish potato omelette samples, respectively. for cooked meat samples, 8.8%, 7.6%, and 24.6% contained e. coli, coagulase-positive staphylococci, and lancefield group-d streptococci, respectively. e. coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., and shigella spp. were not detected. klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, and serratia spp. were isolated from spanish potato omelette samples. for cooked meat samples, c. freundii, e. cloacae, and aeromonas hydrophila were detected. the results suggest that some handling practices should require more attention, and as a consequence, a hazard analysis and critical control point program should be  developed and implemented.

TI  == enhancement of neonatal innate defense: effects of adding an n-terminal recombinant fragment of bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein on growth and tumor necrosis factor-inducing activity of gram-negative bacteria tested in neonatal cord blood ex vivo.
AB  == innate defense against microbial infection requires the action of neutrophils, which have cytoplasmic granules replete with antibiotic proteins and peptides. bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (bpi) is found in the primary granules of adult neutrophils, has a high affinity for lipopolysaccharides (or "endotoxins"), and exerts selective cytotoxic, antiendotoxic, and opsonic activity against gram-negative bacteria. we have previously reported that neutrophils derived from newborn cord blood are deficient in bpi (o. levy et al., pediatrics 104:1327-1333, 1999). the relative deficiency in bpi of newborns raised the possibility that supplementing the levels of bpi in plasma might enhance newborn antibacterial defense. here we determined the effects of addition of recombinant 21-kda n-terminal bpi fragment (rbpi(21)) on the growth and tumor  necrosis factor (tnf)-inducing activity of representative gram-negative clinical  isolates. bacteria were tested in citrated newborn cord blood or adult peripheral blood. bacterial viability was assessed by plating assay, and tnf-alpha release was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. whereas adult blood limited the growth of all isolates except klebsiella pneumoniae, cord blood also allowed  logarithmic growth of escherichia coli k1/r and citrobacter koseri. bacteria varied in their susceptibility to rbpi(21)'s bactericidal action: e. coli k1/r was relatively susceptible (50% inhibitory concentration [ic(50)], approximately  10 nm), c. koseri was intermediate (ic(50), approximately 1,000 nm), klebsiella pneumoniae was resistant (ic(50), approximately 10,000 nm), and enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens were highly resistant (ic(50), >10,000 nm). all isolates were potent inducers of tnf-alpha activity in both adult and newborn cord blood. in contrast to its variable antibacterial activity, rbpi(21) consistently inhibited the tnf-inducing activity of all strains tested (ic(50), 1 to 1,000 nm). the antibacterial effects of rbpi(21) were additive with those of a combination of conventional antibiotics typically used to treat bacteremic newborns (ampicillin and gentamicin). whereas ampicillin and gentamicin demonstrated little inhibition of bacterially induced tnf release, addition of rbpi(21) either alone or together with ampicillin and gentamicin profoundly inhibited release of this cytokine. thus, supplementing newborn cord blood with rbpi(21) potently inhibited the tnf-inducing activity of a variety of gram-negative bacterial clinical pathogens and, in some cases, enhanced bactericidal activity. these results suggest that administration of rbpi(21) may  be of clinical benefit to neonates suffering from gram-negative bacterial infection and/or endotoxemia.

TI  == antigen 43 from escherichia coli induces inter- and intraspecies cell aggregation and changes in colony morphology of pseudomonas fluorescens.
AB  == antigen 43 (ag43) is a surface-displayed autotransporter protein of escherichia coli. by virtue of its self-association characteristics, this protein is able to  mediate autoaggregation and flocculation of e. coli cells in static cultures. additionally, surface display of ag43 is associated with a distinct frizzy colony morphology in e. coli. here we show that ag43 can be expressed in a functional form on the surface of the environmentally important pseudomonas fluorescens strain sbw25 with ensuing cell aggregation and frizzy colony types. using green fluorescence protein-tagged cells, we demonstrate that ag43 can be used as a tool to provide interspecies cell aggregation between e. coli and p. fluorescens. furthermore, ag43 expression enhances biofilm formation in p. fluorescens to glass surfaces. the versatility of this protein was also reflected in ag43 surface display in a variety of other gram-negative bacteria. display of heterologous ag43 in selected bacteria might offer opportunities for rational design of multispecies consortia where the concerted action of several bacterial  species is required, e.g., waste treatment and degradation of pollutants.

TI  == characteristics of neonatal bacterial meningitis in a teaching hospital in taiwan from 1984-1997.
AB  == during the period from 1984 to 1997, 85 bacterial meningitis neonates with positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures were treated. the ages of these patients ranged from 1 to 28 days. the male to female ratio was 1.7 to 1. the most common  causative agent was group b beta-hemolytic streptococci (gbs, 31.8%), followed by escherichia coli (20%), proteus mirabilis (7.1%), enterobacter cloacae (5.9%), other streptococci excluding streptococcus pneumoniae (5.9%), chryseobacterium meningosepticum (5.9%), enterococci (4.7%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (3.5%). among the 85 patients treated, 51 (60%) were younger than 7 days old. among them, dyspnea was the most common clinical manifestation. in contrast, fever and diarrhea were seen more frequently in neonates with late onset of disease (after  seven days of age). ampicillin and cefotaxime were the most commonly used antibiotics. the most frequently encountered complications were hydrocephalus and seizures. since 1991, gbs has overtaken e. coli as the leading cause of neonatal  bacterial meningitis. this was accompanied by a fall in the mortality rate, but a sustained high incidence of complications and sequelae. the results of this study highlight the importance of developing strategies to prevent group b streptococcal infection.

TI  == assessment of the microbiological quality and wash treatments of lettuce served in university restaurants.
AB  == one hundred and forty-four samples of lettuce from 16 university restaurants were analyzed. the mesophilic aerobic counts of all samples ranged from 3.01 to 7.81 log10 cfu g(-1). results of total coliforms ranged from < 0.47 to > 3.38 log10 most probable number (mpn) g(-1). of the lettuce samples, 25.7% harbored escherichia coli, 22.9% staphylococcus aureus and 84% group d streptococci. similarly, 10.4% of the samples harbored aeromonas hydrophila, 2.8% pseudomonas aeruginosa, and coliforms such as 14.6% citrobacter freundii, 8.3% klebsiella pneumoniae, 4.2% enterobacter cloacae and 1.4% providencia spp. salmonella, shigella and e. coli o157:h7 were not detected. when sodium hypochlorite or potassium permanganate solutions were used in washing procedures, the aerobic microorganisms were reduced by more than two log units, and total coliforms by at least one log.

TI  == kombucha fermentation and its antimicrobial activity.
AB  == kombucha was prepared in a tea broth (0.5% w/v) supplemented with sucrose (10% w/v) by using a commercially available starter culture. the ph decreased steadily from 5 to 2.5 during the fermentation while the weight of the "tea fungus" and the od of the tea broth increased through 4 days of the fermentation and remained fairly constant thereafter. the counts of acetic acid-producing bacteria and yeasts in the broth increased up to 4 days of fermentation and decreased afterward. the antimicrobial activity of kombucha was investigated against a number of pathogenic microorganisms. staphylococcus aureus, shigella sonnei, escherichia coli, aeromonas hydrophila, yersinia enterolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus epidermis, campylobacter jejuni, salmonella enteritidis, salmonella typhimurium, bacillus cereus, helicobacterpylori, and listeria monocytogenes were found to be sensitive to kombucha. according to the literature on kombucha, acetic acid is considered to be responsible for the inhibitory effect toward a number of microbes tested, and  this is also valid in the present study. however, in this study, kombucha proved  to exert antimicrobial activities against e. coli, sh. sonnei, sal. typhimurium,  sal. enteritidis, and cm. jejuni, even at neutral ph and after thermal denaturation. this finding suggests the presence of antimicrobial compounds other than acetic acid and large proteins in kombucha.

TI  == a primitive t cell-independent mechanism of intestinal mucosal iga responses to commensal bacteria.
AB  == the immunoglobulin a (iga) is produced to defend mucosal surfaces from environmental organisms, but host defenses against the very heavy load of intestinal commensal microorganisms are poorly understood. the iga against intestinal commensal bacterial antigens was analyzed; it was not simply "natural  antibody" but was specifically induced and responded to antigenic changes within  an established gut flora. in contrast to iga responses against exotoxins, a significant proportion of this specific anti-commensal iga induction was through  a pathway that was independent of t cell help and of follicular lymphoid tissue organization, which may reflect an evolutionarily primitive form of specific immune defense.

TI  == meropenem versus imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of sepsis in chinese patients.
AB  == background: meropenem and imipenem are beta-lactam antibiotics of the carbapenem  group. carbapenems have bactericidal activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria, including most gram-positive cocci, gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes. experience in using meropenem in chinese patients has not been previously reported. methods: meropenem (2 g daily) and imipenem/cilastatin (2 g  daily) were compared in an open, randomized, prospective study on the treatment of hospitalized chinese septic patients. all participants (male or female) were hospitalized with a diagnosis of sepsis. all patients were randomly allocated to  one of the two treatment groups: the meropenem group or the imipenem/cilastatin group. clinical status was evaluated daily during treatment and at the end of therapy or when treatment was withdrawn. patients were checked every day for potential side-effects, according to subjective and objective symptoms. results:  fifty-three patients were enrolled in the study; 50 were evaluated for clinical efficacy and 27 patients were evaluated for bacteriologic efficacy. the most frequent clinical diagnoses were pneumonia and urinary tract infection. the predominant pathogens were pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae. there were 31 pathogens isolated from 27 patients. a single pathogen was identified in 23 patients, and two pathogens were isolated from four patients. satisfactory clinical outcome (excellent and good) was 84% in the meropenem group and 76% in the imipenem/cilastatin group. satisfactory bacteriologic response was 80% in the meropenem group and 75% in the imipenem/cilastatin group. transiently elevated liver enzymes were the most common side-effect. one patient treated with imipenem/cilastatin experienced a seizure during the study, while another patient treated with meropenem withdrew due to urticaria. conclusions: the efficacy and safety data presented in this report indicate that meropenem was well tolerated and appeared to be as effective as standard monotherapy with imipenem in bacteremic patients. meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin were highly effective for the treatment of bacteremia in chinese patients and only mild or negligible side-effects were noted.

TI  == rapid discriminatory detection of genes coding for shv beta-lactamases by ligase  chain reaction.
AB  == ligase chain reaction (lcr) is a recently developed technique that employs a thermostable ligase and allows for the discrimination of dna sequences differing  in only a single base pair. the method has been adapted and applied to differentiation of bla(shv) genes. we have developed an lcr typing method to characterize point mutations in genes for shv-derived extended-spectrum beta-lactamases with four different sets of biotinylated lcr primers. to evaluate the applicability of the current technique, we tested seven escherichia coli strains producing shv-1, shv-2, shv-2a, shv-3, shv-4, shv-5, and shv-12. with the lcr typing, seven shv genes can be distinguished according to their incorporating point mutations. in an attempt to characterize shv beta-lactamases by lcr typing  in clinical isolates, 46 strains carrying bla(shv) genes (32 klebsiella pneumoniae, 10 enterobacter cloacae, and 4 e. coli) were subjected to antibiotic  susceptibility testing, isoelectric focusing, and lcr typing. lcr typing allowed  the characterization of beta-lactamases, and genotypes obtained by lcr typing were in accordance with phenotypes such as antibiotic resistance profile and pi value of beta-lactamase. therefore, we concluded that lcr typing may permit defining the shv families with simplicity and reliability and can be applied to the detailed characterization and molecular epidemiology of shv-type beta-lactamases.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the usa.
AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

AB  == the poisson-boltzmann method was used to compute the pk(a) values of titratable residues in a set of class c beta-lactamases. in these calculations, the pk(a) of the phenolic group of residue tyr150 is the only one to stand out with an abnormally low value of 8.3, more than one pk(a) unit lower than the measured reference value for tyrosine in solution. other important residues of the catalytic pocket, such as the conserved lys67, lys315, his314, and glu272 (hydrogen-bonded to the ammonium group of lys315), display normal protonation states at neutral ph. pk(a) values were also computed in catalytically impaired beta-lactamase mutants. comparisons between the relative k(cat) values and the tyr150 pk(a) value in these mutants revealed a striking correlation. in active enzymes, this pk(a) value is always lower than the solution reference value while it is close to normal in inactive enzymes. these results thus support the hypothesis that the phenolate form of tyr150 is responsible for the activation of the nucleophilic serine. the possible roles of lys67 and lys315 during catalysis  are also discussed.

AB  == field investigations (n=23) were made over a 3-yr period at north american boar studs and farms in which the primary complaint was sperm agglutination in association with decreased sperm longevity of extended semen, and increased regular returns to estrus and/or vaginal discharges across parity. microscopic examination of extended semen from these units revealed depressed gross motility  (usually <30%), sperm agglutination, and sperm cell death occurring within 2 d of semen collection and processing regardless of the semen extender used. the extended semen exhibited a high number of induced acrosome abnormalities (>20%).  sample ph was acidic (5.7 to 6.4) in 93% of the submitted samples. aerobic culture yielded a variety of bacteria from different genera. a single bacterial contaminant was obtained from 66% of the submitted samples (n=37 doses); 34% contained 2 or more different bacterial genera. the most frequently isolated contaminant bacteria from porcine extended semen were alcaligenes xylosoxydans (n=3), burkholderia cepacia (n=6), enterobacter cloacae (n=6), escherichia coli (n=6), serratia marcescens (n=5), and stenotrophomonas [xanthomonas] maltophilia  (n=6); these 6 bacteria accounted for 71% of all contaminated samples, and were spermicidal when re-inoculated and incubated in fresh, high quality extended semen. all contaminant bacteria were found to be resistant to the aminoglycoside  gentamicin, a common preservative antibiotic used in commercial porcine semen extenders. eleven genera were spermicidal in conjunction with an acidic environment, while 2 strains (e. coli, s. maltophilia) were spermicidal without this characteristic acidic environment. bacteria originated from multiple sources at the stud/farm, and were of animal and nonanimal origin. a minimum contamination technique (mct) protocol was developed to standardize hygiene and sanitation. this protocol focused on mct's during boar preparation, semen collection, semen processing and laboratory sanitation. implementation of the mct, in addition to specific recommendations in stud management, resulted in the  control of bacterial contamination in the extended semen.

TI  == comparative aspects of the diffusion of norfloxacin, cefepime and spermine through the f porin channel of enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == in enterobacteriaceae, the permeability of the outer membrane to hydrophilic antibiotics is associated with the presence of pore-forming proteins. we tested the diffusion of the fluoroquinolone norfloxacin in four enterobacter cloacae strains: a clinical isolate and three derivatives variously producing or lacking  the d and f porins. we analysed the entry of norfloxacin into e. cloacae cells in the presence of either the polyamine spermine or the recently developed cefepime, which are known to penetrate through the escherichia coli ompf porin. uptake of the fluoroquinolone was decreased in both cases; the initial rate of penetration  decreased as more spermine blocked the channel. our results indicate that, like beta-lactam molecules, fluoroquinolones translocate through the outer membrane via the f porin and that cefepime and norfloxacin entries are polyamine-sensitive. this suggests that the closure of the f porin channel by polyamines might modulate the susceptibility of e. cloacae to both fluoroquinolone and cephalosporin antibiotics.

TI  == an antibiotic policy to prevent emergence of resistant bacilli.
AB  == background: fear of infection in neonatal intensive care units (nicus) often leads to early use of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics, a strategy that selects for resistant bacteria. we investigated whether the emergence of resistant strains could be halted by modifying the empiric antibiotic regimens to remove the selective pressure that favours resistant bacteria. methods: two identical nicus were assigned to different empiric antibiotic regimens. on unit a, penicillin g and tobramycin were used for early-onset septicaemia, flucloxacillin and tobramycin were used for late-onset septicaemia, and no broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics, such as amoxicillin and cefotaxime were used. in unit b, intravenous amoxicillin with cefotaxime was the empiric therapy. after 6 months of the study the units exchanged regimens. rectal and respiratory cultures were taken on a weekly basis. findings: there were 436 admissions, divided equally between the two regimens (218 in each). three neonates treated with the penicillin-tobramycin regimen became colonised with bacilli resistant to the empirical therapy used versus 41 neonates on the amoxicillin-cefotaxime regimen (p<.0001). the relative risk for colonisation with strains resistant to the empirical therapy per 1000 patient days at risk was 18 times higher for the amoxicillin-cefotaxime regimen compared with the penicillin-tobramycin regimen (95% ci 5.6-58.0). enterobacter cloacae was the predominant bacillus in neonates  on the amoxicillin-cefotaxime regimen, whereas escherichia coli predominated in neonates on the penicillin-tobramycin regimen. these colonisation patterns were also seen when the units exchanged regimens. interpretation: policies regarding the empiric use of antibiotics do matter in the control of antimicrobial resistance. a regimen avoiding amoxicillin and cefotaxime restricts the resistance problem.

AB  == many enteric bacteria express a type i oxygen-insensitive nitroreductase, which reduces nitro groups on many different nitroaromatic compounds under aerobic conditions. enzymatic reduction of nitramines was also documented in enteric bacteria under anaerobic conditions. this study indicates that nitramine reduction in enteric bacteria is carried out by the type i, or oxygen-insensitive nitroreductase, rather than a type ii enzyme. the enteric bacterium morganella morganii strain b2 with documented hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (rdx)  nitroreductase activity, and enterobacter cloacae strain 96-3 with documented 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (tnt) nitroreductase activity, were used here to show that  the explosives tnt and rdx were both reduced by a type i nitroreductase. morganella morganii and e. cloacae exhibited rdx and tnt nitroreductase activities in whole cell assays. type i nitroreductase, purified from e. cloacae, oxidized nadph with tnt or rdx as substrate. when expression of the e. cloacae type i nitroreductase gene was induced in an escherichia coli strain carrying a plasmid, a simultaneous increase in tnt and rdx nitroreductase activities was observed. in addition, neither tnt nor rdx nitroreductase activity was detected in nitrofurazone-resistant mutants of m. morganii. we conclude that a type i nitroreductase present in these two enteric bacteria was responsible for the nitroreduction of both types of explosive.

TI  == new beta -lactamase inhibitory protein (blip-i) from streptomyces exfoliatus smf19 and its roles on the morphological differentiation.
AB  == a new beta-lactamase inhibitory protein (blip-i) from streptomyces exfoliatus smf19 was purified and characterized. the molecular mass of blip-i was estimated  to be 17.5 kda by gel filtration fast protein liquid chromatography. the n-terminal sequence was nh(2)-asn-ser-gly-phe-ser-ala-glu-lys-tyr-glu-gln-ile-gln-phe-gly. blip-i inhibited bacto(r) penase (difco), and plasmid encoded tem-1 beta-lactamase, whereas it did not inhibit enterobacter cloacae beta-lactamases. the k(i) value of blip-i against tem-1 beta-lactamase was determined to be 0.047 nm. the gene (blia) encoding blip-i protein was identified by screening a genomic library using an oligonucleotide probe with a sequence based on the n-terminal sequence of blip-i. analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed that the gene was 558 base pairs in length and encoded a mature protein of 157 amino acid residues preceded by a 29-amino acid signal sequence. pairwise comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence showed 38% identity with blip of streptomyces clavuligerus. furthermore, the 49th amino acid residue of blip-i was identical to asp-49 of blip that was characterized to be an important residue for the inhibitory activity of blip. a modified blip-i in which asp-49 was replaced by alanine (d49a) was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis. the inhibitory activities of recombinant (r) blip-i and its d49a mutant derivative, expressed in escherichia coli, were compared. the k(i) value of rblip-i against tem-1 beta-lactamase was similar to that of wild-type blip-i, but the d49a mutation increased the k(i) of  rblip-i inhibition approximately 200-fold. a disruption mutant of the blia gene in s. exfoliatus smf19 was obtained by replacing the wild-type blia gene with a copy inactivated by inserting a hygromycin resistance gene. the disruption mutant showed a bald phenotype, indicating that the blia gene plays a role in morphological differentiation.

TI  == three-year surveillance study of nosocomial bacterial resistance in argentina. the antimicrobial committee; and the national surveillance program (sir) participants group.
AB  == introduction: a national surveillance program (sir) was introduced in 1996 in argentina by the antimicrobial committee of the argentinean society for microbiology to assess bacterial resistance. the present study reports the rates  of nosocomial bacterial resistance found by this program. methods: a 2-month point-prevalence study was conducted twice yearly (i.e., april-may and october-november) from 1996 to 1998, by 27 argentinean centers. susceptibility testing was carried out by the disk diffusion method following the national committee for clinical laboratory standards guidelines. results: in all, 6343 isolates recovered from 5603 inpatients (> or =48-hr hospitalization) were included. methicillin resistance was 58% and 56% in staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), respectively. although no vancomycin resistance was found in staphylococci, 2% and 8% of the s. aureus and cns strains, respectively, proved resistant to teicoplanin. no ampicillin resistance  was displayed by enterococcus faecalis. high-level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance in enterococci were 33% and 37%, respectively. acquired glycopeptide resistance in enterococci emerged in 1997 (2%). imipenem resistance in acinetobacter spp and pseudomonas aeruginosa was 9% and 21%, respectively. among  enterobacteriaceae, 1% and 5% of the klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae isolates, respectively, proved resistant to imipenem. ceftazidime and cefepime resistance was found in 63% and 33% of the e. cloacae strains. resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins was shown by 48%, 26%, and 8% of the k. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and escherichia coli isolates, respectively. conclusions: the alarming rates of resistance found in this study provide compelling evidence of the need for more rational use of antimicrobial agents in argentina.

AB  == the difference between the spectra of potential bacterial pathogens (pbps) in the nasal vestibule and cavity has not been taken into account in clinical studies. purpose: since one can anticipate different flora in different kinds of mucosae,  the authors compared bacterial species in the vestibule with those of the cavity. subjects and method: a total of 534 healthy male clerical workers in a downtown lucerne office building were examined with fractionated swabs. results: pbps, notably staphylococcus aureus, were found in 412 subjects and surprisingly, differences in flora of the two sites were noted in 130 of them: pbps were observed in the vestibule and not in the cavity in 85 of the subjects, and in 45  of them, the reverse was true. conclusion: the practical implications of these findings are considerable regarding infection control in patients at increased infection risk.

TI  == mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  == 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. the 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. the implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included enterobacter species (enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), klebsiella species (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca), escherichia coli, staphylococcus species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus, serratia marcescens, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus viridans and neisseria meningitidis. six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included e. cloacae in one, a. baumannii in one, k. pneumoniae in one and s. aureus in three. the management of  these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the  high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. however, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.

TI  == [in vitro activity of biapenem (bipm) against clinically isolated respiratory pathogens in 1996-1998].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of biapenem (bipm), a new carbapenem antibiotic, was compared with those of imipenem (ipm), panipenem (papm), meropenem (mepm), ceftazidime (caz) and piperacillin (pipc) against 280 isolates  of 9 respiratory pathogens. the mic90s of biapenem (bipm) for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and haemophilus influenzae were 0.12, 32, 0.25, 0.06, 4 and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively. in comparison with other antibiotics, the activity of biapenem (bipm) for p. aeruginosa was as potent as meropenem (mepm),  but for h. influenzae it was slightly less than those of other antibiotics, and for other respiratory pathogens it was as potent as those of other antibiotics. the mic90s of biapenem (bipm) for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens were 0.06, 1, 1, 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively, and which were equal to or somewhat lower than those of other antibiotics. biapenem (bipm) showed strong activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, especially p. aeruginosa in general. based on these results, biapenem (bipm) is seemed to be highly useful antibiotic for the treatment of respiratory infections with several organism.

TI  == ampr gene mutations that greatly increase class c beta-lactamase activity in enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == the ampc and ampr genes of enterobacter cloacae gn7471 were cloned into pmw218 to yield pku403. four mutant plasmids derived from pku403 (pku404, pku405, pku406, and pku407) were isolated in an ampd mutant of escherichia coli ml4953 by selection with ceftazidime or aztreonam. the beta-lactamase activities expressed  by pku404, pku405, pku406, and pku407 were about 450, 75, 160, and 160 times higher, respectively, than that expressed by the original plasmid, pku403. these  mutant plasmids all carried point mutations in the ampr gene. in pku404 and pku405, asp-135 was changed to asn and val, respectively. in both pku406 and pku407, arg-86 was changed to cys. the ease of selection of ampr mutations at a frequency of about 10(-6) in this study strongly suggests that derepressed strains, such as ampd or ampr mutants, could frequently emerge in the clinical setting.

TI  == detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae and enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to investigate the frequency of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in a consecutive collection of clinical isolates of enterobacter spp. the abilities of various screening methods to detect esbls in enterobacters were simultaneously tested. among the 68 consecutive isolates (56 enterobacter cloacae and 12 enterobacter aerogenes isolates) that were analyzed for beta-lactamase content, 21 (25 and 58%, respectively) possessed transferable esbls with pis of 8.2 and phenotypic characteristics of shv-type enzymes, 8 (14.3%) of the e. cloacae isolates produced a previously nondescribed, clavulanate-susceptible esbl that exhibited a pi of 6.9 and that conferred a ceftazidime resistance phenotype on escherichia coli transconjugants, and 2 e. cloacae isolates produced both of these enzymes. among the total of 31 isolates that were considered esbl producers, the vitek esbl detection test was positive for 2 (6.5%) strains, and the conventional double-disk synergy test (ddst) with amoxicillin-clavulanate and with expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and aztreonam was positive for 5 (16%) strains.  modifications of the ddst consisting of closer application of the disks (at 20 instead of 30 mm), the use of cefepime, and the use of both modifications increased the sensitivity of this test to 71, 61, and 90%, respectively. of the 37 isolates for which isoelectric focusing failed to determine esbls, the vitek test was false positive for 1 isolate and the various forms of ddsts were false-positive for 3 isolates.

TI  == viresin. a novel antibacterial protein from immune hemolymph of heliothis virescens pupae.
AB  == immune hemolymph was collected from fifth instar larvae and 1-day-old pupae of heliothis virescens after injection of prepupae with live enterobacter cloacae. induction of antibacterial activity against escherichia coli k12 d31 was 7.5 times greater in pupal than in larval immune hemolymph. lysozyme activity of immune pupal hemolymph against micrococcus lysodeikticus was 11 times greater when compared with lysozyme activity of immune larval hemolymph. early pupal immune response with regard to antibacterial activity was much greater than larval immune response in h. virescens. normal pupal hemolymph showed an increase in antibacterial activity and lysozyme that was induced during metamorphosis. antibacterial protein was isolated together with lysozyme by gel filtration chromatography and then separated from lysozyme by sequential electrophoresis with a native acid gel and sds gel. molecular mass of antibacterial protein was estimated to be 12 kda. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of 12-kda protein was  different from those of antibacterial molecules found in other insects and has not been identified before. a sample containing 12-kda protein was negative for immunoblotting with anti-synthetic cecropin b antibody. we have named the novel 12-kda antibacterial protein viresin. viresin showed antibacterial activity against several gram-negative bacteria including e. cloacae but not against gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == surveillance of antibiotic resistance in taiwan, 1998.
AB  == for the first national surveillance of antibiotic resistance in taiwan, we collected in 1998 from 22 hospitals (6 medical centers, 15 regional hospitals, and 1 local hospital) 3,211 isolates in all parts of the country. besides 50 random successive isolates from inpatients, each hospital was requested to collect 25 isolates each from positive blood cultures, hospital-acquired infections, outpatients and the pediatric department. we re-speciated all the submitted specimens and determined their antibiotic susceptibility patterns. the  most common isolates were enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae), staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. among hospital-acquired infections, acinetobacter spp. were among those which accounted for over 10% of the isolates. the oxacillin resistance of s. aureus was 82% in isolates from hospital-acquired infections, and 40% from outpatients. among enterococcus spp., 85% were either e. faecalis or e. faecium. they were 14% resistant to vancomycin. among gram-negative bacteria, k. pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumanii were hospital-acquired isolates that were most clearly more resistant than community acquired isolates. this difference was less apparent in the case of enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and p. aeruginosa. these bacteria were generally more resistant from all sources. fifty-one percent of salmonella were resistant to ampicillin; however, these were all sensitive to ciprofloxacin. isolates from the east were least resistant. plotting the disc zone diameters of antibiotics within the susceptible range, we  identified subpopulations with smaller diameters in the case of vancomycin against s. aureus, ciprofloxacin against e. coli, and ciprofloxacin against salmonella spp. these findings represent one of the purposes of this surveillance as they may portend developing resistances which bear careful watching in the future.

TI  == convenient test for screening metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria by using thiol compounds.
AB  == a simple disk diffusion test was constructed for detection of imp-1-type metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria. two kirby-bauer disks containing ceftazidime (caz) and a filter disk containing a metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitor were used in this test. several imp-1 inhibitors such as thiol compounds including 2-mercaptopropionic acid, heavy metal salts, and edta were evaluated for this test. two caz disks were placed on a mueller-hinton agar plate on which a bacterial suspension was spread according to the method recommended by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the distance between the disks was kept to about 4 to 5 cm, and a filter disk containing a metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitor was placed near one of  the caz disks within a center-to-center distance of 1.0 to 2.5 cm. for imp-1-producing strains, the growth-inhibitory zone between the two disks expanded, while no evident change in the shape of the growth-inhibitory zone was  observed for caz-resistant strains producing serine beta-lactamases such as ampc  or shv-12. as a result, 2 to 3 microliter of undiluted 2-mercaptopropionic acid or mercaptoacetic acid able to block imp-1 activity gave the most reproducible and clearest results, and caz-resistant strains producing ampc or extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were distinguishable from imp-1 producers by this test. a similar observation was made with imp-1-producing clinical isolates  such as serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter spp., and alcaligenes xylosoxidans. the specificity and sensitivity of this test were comparable to those of pcr analysis using bla(imp)-specific primers. therefore, this convenient test would be valuable for daily use in clinical laboratories.

TI  == role of penicillin-binding proteins in the initiation of the ampc beta-lactamase  expression in enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) are involved in the regulation of beta-lactamase expression by determining the level of anhydromuramylpeptides in the periplasmatic space. it was hypothesized that one or more pbps act as a sensor in the beta-lactamase induction pathway. we have performed induction studies with escherichia coli mutants lacking one to four pbps with dd-carboxypeptidase activity. therefore, we conclude that a strong beta-lactamase inducer must inhibit all dd-carboxypeptidases as well as the essential pbps 1a, 1b, and/or 2.

AB  == study objective: to compare the time above the minimum inhibitory concentration (t>mic) for five parenteral beta-lactam antibiotics against common nosocomial bacterial pathogens at different creatinine clearances (clcr). interventions: serum concentration-time profiles were simulated for cefepime, ceftazidime, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and imipenem at clcr ranging from 120-30 ml/minute. the mic data for 90% of organisms (mic90) were collected for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and a weighted geometric mean mic90 was calculated. the t>mic was calculated as percentage of the dosing interval in which free concentrations exceeded the weighted geometric mean mic90. a t>mic of 70% or greater was considered desirable for all organisms except s. aureus (> or = 50%). measurements and main results: cefepime 2 g every 12 hours (clcr > or = 70 ml/min) and every 24 hours (clcr < or = 60 ml/min) achieved desirable t>mic for all enterobacteriaceae and s. aureus at every clcr. imipenem  0.5 g achieved desirable t>mic for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, c. freundii, and s. aureus at every clcr. however, imipenem t>mic was less than 70% for the following regimens and organisms: s. marcescens 0.5 g every 6 hours (clcr > or = 90 ml/min), e. aerogenes 0.5 g every 6 hours (clcr > or = 80 ml/min), e. cloacae 0.5 g every 6 hours (clcr > or = 100 ml/min), s. marcescens 0.5 g every 8 hours (clcr 60-70 ml/min), e. cloacae 0.5 g every 8 hours (clcr 60-70 ml/min), and e. aerogenes 0.5 g every 8 hours (clcr 50-70 ml/min). ceftazidime 2 g every 8 hours  (clcr 60-100 ml/min) and every 12 hours (clcr 40-50 ml/min) achieved desirable t>mic for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and s. aureus only. at every dose and clcr, piperacillintazobactam achieved desirable t>mic for s. aureus but  not for any enterobacteriaceae at clcr > 50 ml/minute. piperacillin did not achieve desirable t>mic for any organism, and none of the beta-lactams attained a t>mic of 70% or above for p. aeruginosa at any clcr. conclusion: at every clcr, cefepime achieved a desirable t>mic for more nosocomial pathogens than any other  beta-lactam evaluated. based on pharmacodynamic data, cefepime is an appropriate  empiric choice for treatment of nosocomial infections. however, when p. aeruginosa is a potential pathogen, empiric combination therapy should be considered.

TI  == gram-negative bacillary meningitis in adult post-neurosurgical patients.
AB  == background: to assess the clinical features and therapeutic outcomes of gram-negative bacillary meningitis (gnbm) in adult postneurosurgical patients. methods: thirty adult patients with gnbm were included in this study. their clinical features, laboratory data, prognostic factors, and therapeutic outcome were analyzed. the patients were 22 males and 8 females, aged 17-72 years. seven  had community-acquired infections and 23 had nosocomial infections. two patients  were associated with brain abscess. results: the pathogens found in the 30 gnbm patients were pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella species, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, and some rare pathogens including citrobacter freundii,  serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus mirabilis. among these 30  patients, 8 patients with third-generation cephalosporin-resistant gnbm were identified since 1994; all infections were nosocomially acquired. appropriate antibiotics were given to 22 patients. eight patients did not receive appropriate antibiotic therapy. all eight died. the mortality rate in those treated with appropriate antibiotics was 14%. conclusions: there has been an increase of gnbm  in postneurosurgical patients in recent years. in addition, the emergence of strains resistant to third-generation cephalosporins in this specific group of patients has also been noted in recent years, and has become a great therapeutic  challenge. we noted many prognostic factors in postneurosurgical patients in this study; however, appropriate antibiotic therapy and initial consciousness level are the most significant ones. therefore, in cases of postneurosurgical patients  with nosocomially acquired gnbm, the possibility of third-generation cephalosporin resistance should be strongly suspected. early initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy is needed in this potentially fatal disease.

TI  == the complexed structure and antimicrobial activity of a non-beta-lactam inhibitor of ampc beta-lactamase.
AB  == beta-lactamases are the major resistance mechanism to beta-lactam antibiotics and pose a growing threat to public health. recently, bacteria have become resistant  to beta-lactamase inhibitors, making this problem pressing. in an effort to overcome this resistance, non-beta-lactam inhibitors of beta-lactamases were investigated for complementarity to the structure of ampc beta-lactamase from escherichia coli. this led to the discovery of an inhibitor, benzo(b)thiophene-2-boronic acid (bzbth2b), which inhibited ampc with a ki of 27  nm. this inhibitor is chemically dissimilar to beta-lactams, raising the question of what specific interactions are responsible for its activity. to answer this question, the x-ray crystallographic structure of bzbth2b in complex with ampc was determined to 2.25 a resolution. the structure reveals several unexpected interactions. the inhibitor appears to complement the conserved, r1-amide binding region of ampc, despite lacking an amide group. interactions between one of the boronic acid oxygen atoms, tyr150, and an ordered water molecule suggest a mechanism for acid/base catalysis and a direction for hydrolytic attack in the enzyme catalyzed reaction. to investigate how a non-beta-lactam inhibitor would perform against resistant bacteria, bzbth2b was tested in antimicrobial assays. bzbth2b significantly potentiated the activity of a third-generation cephalosporin against ampc-producing resistant bacteria. this inhibitor was unaffected by two common resistance mechanisms that often arise against beta-lactams in conjunction with beta-lactamases. porin channel mutations did not decrease the efficacy of bzbth2b against cells expressing ampc. also, this inhibitor did not induce expression of ampc, a problem with many beta-lactams. the structure of the bzbth2b/ampc complex provides a starting point for the structure-based elaboration of this class of non-beta-lactam inhibitors.

AB  == objective: to investigate an outbreak of gram-negative bacteremias at a hemodialysis center (december 1, 1996-january 31, 1997). design: retrospective cohort study. reviewed infection control practices and maintenance and disinfection procedures for the water system and dialysis machines. performed cultures of the water and dialysis machines, including the waste-handling option  (who), a drain port designed to dispose of saline used to flush the dialyzer before patient use. compared isolates by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. setting: a hemodialysis center in maryland. results: 94 patients received dialysis on 27 machines; 10 (11%) of the patients had gram-negative bacteremias.  pathogens causing these infections were enterobacter cloacae (n = 6), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), and escherichia coli (n = 2); two patients had polymicrobial  bacteremia. factors associated with development of gram-negative bacteremias were receiving dialysis via a central venous catheter (cvc) rather than via an arterio-venous shunt (all 10 infected patients had cvcs compared to 31 of 84 uninfected patients, relative risk [rr] undefined; p<.001) or dialysis on any of  three particular dialysis machines (7 of 10 infected patients were exposed to the three machines compared to 20 of 84 uninfected patients, rr = 5.8; p = .005). e cloacae, p aeruginosa, or both organisms were grown from cultures obtained from several dialysis machines. who valves, which prevent backflow from the drain to dialysis bloodlines, were faulty in 8 (31%) of 26 machines, including 2 of 3 machines epidemiologically linked to case-patients. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns of available dialysis machine and patient e cloacae isolates were identical. conclusions: our study suggests that who ports with incompetent valves and resultant backflow were a source of cross-contamination of dialysis bloodlines and patients' cvcs. replacement of faulty who valves and enhanced disinfection of dialysis machines terminated the outbreak.

TI  == interference with murein turnover has no effect on growth but reduces beta-lactamase induction in escherichia coli.
AB  == physiological studies of a mutant of escherichia coli lacking the three lytic transglycosylases slt70, mlta, and mltb revealed that interference with murein turnover can prevent ampc beta-lactamase induction. the triple mutant, although growing normally, shows a dramatically reduced rate of murein turnover. despite the reduction in the formation of low-molecular-weight murein turnover products,  neither the rate of murein synthesis nor the amount of murein per cell was increased. this might be explained by assuming that during growth in the absence  of the major lytic transglycosylases native murein strands are excised by the action of endopeptidases and directly reused without further breakdown to muropeptides. the reduced rate of murein turnover could be correlated with lowered cefoxitin-induced expression of beta-lactamase, present on a plasmid carrying the ampc and ampr genes from enterobacter cloacae. overproduction of mltb stimulated beta-lactamase induction, whereas specific inhibition of slt70 by bulgecin repressed ampc expression. thus, specific inhibitors of lytic transglycosylases can increase the potency of penicillins and cephalosporins against bacteria inducing ampc-like beta-lactamases.

AB  == resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins within members of the family enterobacteriaceae occurs virtually world-wide. nevertheless, nothing was known about this problem among isolates from mexico. to address this issue, we studied  oximino-cephalosporin resistant isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae (13), escherichia coli (7), and enterobacter cloacae (23) recovered from patients in mexico city hospitals during 1990 to 1992. in the presence of clavulanic acid, these strains increased susceptibility to cefotaxime and ceftazidime (mic90 64 and >256 microg/ml, respectively). the ability of these isolates to transfer resistance to both antibiotics by conjugation was most successfully demonstrated  by k. pneumoniae. in all the clinical isolates tested, the largest plasmid coded  for the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl). characteristics of pi, by isoelectric focusing (ief)/bioassay and dna hybridization with specific probes of tem and shv, indicated that in most of the clinical isolates and all transconjugates, the most frequent beta-lactamase coded were shv-derived (20 strains as 41% of isolates) and a plasmid-encoded beta-lactamase (12 strains as 25% of isolates) (with a pi of >8.2), which is not related to tem/shv. apparently, isolates from mexico show characteristics similar to isolates from other geographic areas. the type of beta-lactamases coded in these resistant isolates is documented for the first time in mexico.

TI  == the distribution of enteric bacteria from australian mammals: host and geographical effects.
AB  == bacteria of the family enterobacteriaceae were isolated from 642 mammalian hosts, representing 16 families and 79 species, collected from throughout australia. escherichia coli was the most common of the 24 enteric species recovered and represented almost half of the isolates. association analysis revealed that most  other species of bacteria were less likely to be recovered from hosts in which e. coli was present. the composition of the enteric community of a host was found to be determined by both the taxonomic family to which the host belonged and the geographical area from which the host was collected. hosts collected from the northern areas of queensland and the northern territory had more diverse enteric  communities than hosts collected from new south wales or western australia. hosts of the families petauridae and vespertilionidae had more diverse enteric communities than did members of the macropodidae or phalangeridae. the probability of occurrence of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, hafnia alvei, klebsiella oxytoca and k. pneumoniae in a host was found to vary with respect to host family and/or host locality. the non-random distribution of these species demonstrates the presence of extensive population structure and may suggest the existence of adaptations specific to both the primary and secondary habitats of these enteric bacteria.

TI  == etiology of serious infections in young gambian infants.
AB  == background: despite improvements in infant mortality rates in many developing countries including the gambia, neonatal mortality remains high and many neonatal deaths are caused by infection. the study described in this paper was conducted to determine the bacterial and viral etiology of serious infections in gambian infants younger than 91 days old. methods: at a first level health facility 497 infants with symptoms that could indicate serious infection were enrolled, of whom 239 with 1 or more signs of serious infection and 55 with no signs were investigated, yielding 17 cases with positive bacterial cultures of blood and/or  cerebrospinal fluid. at a nearby pediatric referral hospital 198 infants were seen and 182 were investigated, yielding 35 positive bacterial cultures. results: there were 15 culture positive cases of meningitis caused by streptococcus pneumoniae (7), streptococcus pyogenes (2), enterobacter cloacae (2), escherichia coli (1), haemophilus influenzae type b (1), streptococcus agalactiae (1) and salmonella spp. (1). six of these children died. thirty-three infants without meningitis had positive blood cultures for staphylococcus aureus (17), s. pneumoniae (3), salmonella spp. (5), e. coli (3), other enterobacteria (4) and s. agalactiae (1), of whom 14 died. nasopharyngeal aspirates from 438 children were  investigated for common respiratory viruses. respiratory syncytial virus was found in 51, influenza a in 46, influenza b in 22, parainfluenza in 26 and adenovirus in 16. respiratory syncytial virus and influenza a isolates were found most frequently toward the end of the wet season. nasopharyngeal carriage of s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae was studied in 320 infants recruited during the first year. of these 184 (58%) were positive for s. pneumoniae and 141 (44%) were positive for h. influenzae, 18 of which were type b. infants with a bacterial isolate from blood or cerebrospinal fluid were more likely than the rest to die,  whereas those with a viral isolate were less likely to die. conclusions: the most important causes of serious infections in young gambian infants are staphylococcus aureus, s. pneumoniae and salmonella spp.

TI  == characteristics of pathogens causing urinary tract infections in hospitals in north america: results from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, 1997.
AB  == urinary tract infection (uti) is common and involves pathogens with changing susceptibility patterns. the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program evaluates  international pathogen incidence patterns to detect and manage the emergence of resistant strains. we describe the antimicrobial resistance patterns among 1617 pathogens recovered from utis during the third-quarter of 1997 in north america (united states and canada), as part of this worldwide program. the isolates were  tested against more than 50 antimicrobial agents (20 reported) by reference broth microdilution methods, and selected isolates were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and automated ribotyping. the five most frequently isolated species were escherichia coli (48.6%), enterococcus spp. (13.7%), klebsiella spp. (12.0%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.2%), and enterobacter spp. or  proteus mirabilis (3.8% each). for each nation, imipenem and cefepime produced the widest spectrum of coverage among the beta-lactams and amikacin was best among the aminoglycosides. for gram-negative species, high resistance among beta-lactam antimicrobial agents was noted especially for various penicillins against e. coli (37.9% to 42.8%) and for the cephalosporins tested against enterococci (99.4% and 100%). approximately 7.0% of enterococci in the usa were vancomycin-resistant (88% with van a). p. aeruginosa provided the most consistent levels of resistance, but the following agents were most active against these organisms: amikacin (96.6 to 97.4% susceptible), tobramycin (89.5 to 100.0%), piperacillin/tazobactam (89.5 to 100.0%), piperacillin (89.5 to 96.6%), imipenem  (89.7 to 92.1%), cefepime (77.6 to 89.7%), and ceftazidime (82.9 to 86.2%). e. coli (2.2 to 2.7%), k. pneumoniae (6.2 to 6.4%), and a single enterobacter cloacae strain produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases; and five other enterobacter spp. were likely to have expressed chromosomally mediated (amp c) stably derepressed cephalosporinases with associated resistance to ceftazidime (16.7 to 21.2% resistance). these data demonstrated that several uti isolates in  sentry hospitals have high levels of resistance to various classes of antimicrobial agents with little evidence of clonal dissemination.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between july 1996 and june 1997].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained during period from july 1996 to june 1997. the number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. a total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). from primary infections 162 strains were isolated,  and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. from primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was the highest.  in postoperative infections, the majority of them were enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were enterococcus avium. the isolation  rate of staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of enterococcus spp. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and enterobacter cloacae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like b. fragilis group and of aerobic gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. we found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither staphylacoccus aureus nor enterococcus spp.; however, the mic of arbekacin for one of strains of s. aureus  was 100 micrograms/ml. both the mic90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against p. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.

TI  == glycosylation of the enterobacter cloacae outer membrane protein ompx in eukaryotic cells.
AB  == the topological model of the enterobacter cloacae outer membrane protein ompx showed three putative glycosylation sites. when ompx was expressed in bacteria that were cultured under aerated conditions, no glycosylation was observed. the coupling of carbohydrate chains to the ompx gene product was also investigated in the eukaryotic baculovirus expression system. for this purpose, a recombinant ompx gene-containing baculovirus was made. infection of insect cells with this recombinant virus resulted in the production of sufficient amounts of ompx to study glycosylation. in this system, all potential n-glycosylation sites of ompx  were utilized. furthermore, it became clear that glycosylated ompx was retained in the insect cells and was not secreted in the medium. given the fact that ompx  plays a role in the invasion of e. cloacae in rabbit enterocytes, glycosylation of this protein occurring only under specific conditions may be involved in this  process.

TI  == impact of use of multiple antimicrobials on changes in susceptibility of gram-negative aerobes.
AB  == evaluation of antimicrobial usage vs. susceptibility relationships typically involves single agents. however, susceptibility profiles may be affected by multiple drugs. from 1992 through 1996, we studied relationships between drug usage and the susceptibility (only susceptibility rates of > or = 70%) of acinetobacter anitratus (baumannii), enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens to 22 agents. linear regression was used to assess usage of each agent vs. susceptibility to it and to all agents. only relationships with a coefficient of determination of > or = 0.5 and a negative slope were evaluated and classified as increasing drug use and decreasing susceptibility (increasing d, decreasing %s) or decreasing drug use and increasing susceptibility (decreasing d, increasing %s). the mean numbers (range) of drugs associated with a change in susceptibility were 1.7 (0-14) and 0.6 (0-7), respectively, for increasing d, decreasing %s and decreasing d, increasing %s relationships. multiple antimicrobials are associated with susceptibility to other drugs; thus, surveillance of these relationships should not be limited to single drugs.

TI  == penetration of beta-lactamase inhibitors into the periplasm of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the effectiveness of a beta-lactamase inhibitor/beta-lactam combination against gram-negative pathogens depends on many interplaying factors, one of which is the penetration of the inhibitor across the outer membrane. in this work we have measured the relative penetrations of clavulanic acid, sulbactam, tazobactam and  brl 42715 into two strains of escherichia coli producing tem-1 beta-lactamase, two strains of klebsiella pneumoniae producing either tem-1 or k-1, and two strains of enterobacter cloacae each producing a class c beta-lactamase. it was shown that clavulanic acid penetrated the outer membranes of all these strains more readily than the other beta-lactamase inhibitors. for the strains of e. coli and k. pneumoniae clavulanic acid penetrated approximately 6 to 19 times more effectively than tazobactam, 2 to 9 times more effectively than sulbactam and 4 to 25 times more effectively than brl 42715. the superior penetration of clavulanic acid observed in this study is likely to contribute to the efficacy of clavulanic acid/beta-lactam combinations in combating beta-lactam resistant bacterial pathogens.

AB  == the results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the japanese ministry of health and welfare during the period of january 1993 to july 1995, were analyzed for typical gram-negative  bacilli in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. during these 3 years, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes and proteus mirabilis showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to fosfomycin (fom) and citrobacter freundii. klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes showed slightly increasing tendency to minocycline (mino). while haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefmetazole (cmz). however, these annual changes were almost negligible. generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against gram-negative bacilli. however, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. on the other hand, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st), cmz, latamoxef (lmox), gentamicin (gm) and amikacin (amk) showed good activities against some of the gram-negative bacilli to which no indications are approved. in conclusion, bedside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of antimicrobial agents is necessary.

TI  == [survey of the sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  == research groups were formed in 21 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance. the activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems, were tested against clinical isolates collected from these institutions. the broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,241 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at all institutions between october and  december 1996. the results were as follows: carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against mssa and streptococcus pneumoniae and showed low activities against mrsa. their activities against enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of ampicillin and piperacillin. the carbapenems showed high activities against haemophilis influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae. enterobacter cloacae. serratia marcescens and bacteroides fragilis group. their activities were greater than that exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains of serratia marcescens were detected. the antibacterial activity of carbapenems against pseudomonas aeruginosa was comparable to that of caz, and there were some resistant strains.

TI  == evaluation of the in vitro activity of six broad-spectrum beta-lactam antimicrobial agents tested against over 2,000 clinical isolates from 22 medical  centers in japan. japan antimicrobial resistance study group.
AB  == numerous broad-spectrum beta-lactam antimicrobial agents have been introduced into medical practice since 1985. although several of these compounds have advanced, infectious disease therapy resistances to them has also emerged world-wide. in 1997, a japanese 22 medical center investigation was initiated to  assess the continued utility of these agents (oxacillin or piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, cefoperazone/sulbactam [c/s], imipenem). the participating medical centers represented a wide geographic distribution, and a common protocol and reagents were applied. three control strains and a set of challenge organisms were provided to participant centers. etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) strips were used in concurrent tests of these organisms and a qualitative determination of participant skills in the identification of resistant and susceptible phenotypes was established. the quantitative controls demonstrated 97.7-99.2% of mic values within established qc limits, and the qualitative (susceptibility category) controls documented a 97.3% agreement of participant results with that of reference values (1,320 total results). only 0.2% of values were false-susceptible errors. after the participant quality was assured, a total of 2,015 clinical strains were tested (10 strains from 10 different organism groups including methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci [cons], escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., indole-positive proteae, serratia spp.,  acinetobacter spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa). the staphylococci were uniformly susceptible to all drugs tested except ceftazidime (mic90, 24 micrograms/ml) that had a potency six- to 12-fold less than either cefepime or cefpirome. only 3.7 and 45.1% of s. aureus and cons were susceptible to ceftazidime, respectively. among e. coli and klebsiella spp. the rank order of antimicrobial spectrum was imipenem = "fourth-generation" cephalosporins > ceftazidime > c/s > piperacillin. possible extended spectrum beta-lactamase phenotypes were identified in 2.9-8.6%  of these isolates. isolates of c. freundii, enterobacter spp., proteae, and serratia spp. that were resistant to ceftazidime and piperacillin remained susceptible to imipenem (0.0-4.5% resistance) and cefepime (0.0-5.0%). acinetobacters were inhibited best by c/s (99.5% susceptible) and least susceptible to piperacillin (mic90, > 256 micrograms/ml; 21.7% susceptible) activity. p. aeruginosa isolates were most susceptible to cefepime (83.6%) and this zwitterionic cephalosporin also had the lowest level of resistance (9.1% of  mics at > or = 32 micrograms/ml). several multi-resistant organisms were identified in participant medical centers including s. marcescens strains resistant to cefepime, imipenem, or both observed in six hospitals. clonal spread was documented in two medical centers; one hospital having two distinct epidemic  clusters. also a multi-resistant e. cloacae was found in two patients in the same hospital. evaluations of carbapenem resistance in four species discovered only two strains (in same hospital) among 40 p. aeruginosa isolates (5.0%) with a metallo-enzyme, with nearly all of the remaining strains inhibited by an ambler class c enzyme inhibitor (brl42715) indicating a hyperproduction of a chromosomal cephalosporinase. these results indicate that most newer beta-lactams remain widely useable in medical centers in japan, but emerging often clonal, resistances have occurred. the overall rank order of antimicrobial spectrum against all ten tested bacterial groups favors the "fourth-generation" cephalosporin, cefepime (96.4% susceptible) as an equal to imipenem (95.9%) > c/s (90.9%) = cefpirome (90.0%) > ceftazidime (75.1%) = penicillins, either oxacillin or piperacillin (76.4%).

TI  == use of microdilution panels with and without beta-lactamase inhibitors as a phenotypic test for beta-lactamase production among escherichia coli, klebsiella  spp., enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens.
AB  == over the past decade, a number of new beta-lactamases have appeared in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae that, unlike their predecessors, do not confer beta-lactam resistance that is readily detected in routine antibiotic susceptibility tests. because optimal methodologies are needed to detect these important new beta-lactamases, a study was designed to evaluate the ability of a  panel of various beta-lactam antibiotics tested alone and in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors to discriminate between the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, ampc beta-lactamases, high levels of k1 beta-lactamase, and other beta-lactamases in 141 isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens possessing well-characterized beta-lactamases. the microdilution panels studied contained aztreonam, cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone, with and without 1, 2, and 4 microg of clavulanate per ml or 8 microg of sulbactam per ml  and cefoxitin and cefotetan with and without 8 microg of sulbactam per ml. the results indicated that a minimum panel of five tests would provide maximum separation of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase high ampc, high k1, and other beta-lactamase production in enterobacteriaceae. these included cefpodoxime, cefpodoxime plus 4 microg of clavulanate per ml, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and ceftriaxone plus 8 microg of sulbactam per ml. ceftriaxone plus 2 microg of clavulanate per ml could be substituted for cefpodoxime plus 4 microg of clavulanate per ml without altering the accuracy of the tests. this study indicated that tests with key beta-lactam drugs, alone and in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, could provide a convenient approach to the detection of a variety of beta-lactamases in members of the family enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == role of pfka and general carbohydrate catabolism in seed colonization by enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == enterobacter cloacae a-11 is a transposon mutant of strain 501r3 that was deficient in cucumber spermosphere colonization and in the utilization of certain carbohydrates (d. p. roberts, c. j. sheets, and j. s. hartung, can. j. microbiol. 38:1128-1134, 1992). in vitro growth of strain a-11 was reduced or deficient on most carbohydrates that supported growth of strain 501r3 but was unaffected on fructose, glycerol, and all amino acids and organic acids tested. colonization by strain a-11 was significantly reduced (p </= 0.05) for cucumber and radish seeds  compared to that of strain 501r3, but colonization of pea, soybean, sunflower, and sweet corn seeds was not reduced. pea seeds released several orders of magnitude more total carbohydrates and amino acids than cucumber and radish seeds and approximately 4,000-fold more fructose. fructose was the only carbohydrate detected in the seed exudates which supported wild-type levels of in vitro growth of strain a-11. soybean, sunflower, and sweet corn seeds also released significantly greater amounts of fructose and total carbohydrates and amino acids than cucumber or radish seeds. the exogenous addition of fructose to cucumber and radish seeds at quantities similar to the total quantity of carbohydrates released from pea seeds over 96 h increased the populations of strain a-11 to levels comparable to those of strain 501r3 in sterile sand. molecular characterization of strain a-11 indicated that the mini-tn5 kanamycin transposon  was inserted in a region of the genome with significant homology to pfka, which encodes phosphofructo kinase. a comparison of strain a-11 with escherichia coli df456, a known pfka mutant, indicated that the nutritional loss phenotypes were identical. furthermore, the pfka homolog cloned from e. cloacae 501r3 complemented the nutritional loss phenotypes of both e. coli df456 and e. cloacae a-11 and restored colonization by strain a-11 to near wild-type levels. these genetic and biochemical restoration experiments provide strong evidence that the  quantities of reduced carbon sources found in seed exudates and the ability of microbes to use these compounds play important roles in the colonization of the spermosphere.

AB  == the frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 560 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (utis) in 9 hospitals during the period of june 1997 to may 1998. of the above bacterial isolates, gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.3% and a majority of them were enterococcus faecalis. gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.7% and most of them were escherichia coli. susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. enterococcus faecalis ampicillin (abpc) showed the highest activity against e. faecalis isolated from patients with utis. its mic90 was 1 microgram/ml. imipenem (ipm) and vancomycin (vcm) were also active with the mic90s of 2 micrograms/ml. the others had low activities with the mic90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. staphylococcus aureus including mrsa vcm and arbekacin (abk) showed the highest activities against both s. aureus and mrsa isolated from patients with utis. the  mic90s of them were 1 microgram/ml. the others except minocycline (mino) had low  activities with the mic90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. more than a half of s. aureus strains (including mrsa) showed high susceptibilities to gentamicin (gm) and mino, the mic50s of 0.25 microgram/ml or 0.5 microgram/ml. 3. enterobacter cloacae ipm showed the highest activity against e. cloacae. the mics for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. the mic90s of ciprofloxacin (cpfx) and tosufloxacin (tflx) were 1 microgram/ml, the mic90s of amikacin (amk)  and ofloxacin (oflx) were 4 micrograms/ml, the mic90 of gm was 16 micrograms/ml.  among e. cloacae strains, those with low susceptibilities to quinolones have decreased in 1997, compared with those in 1996. but the other drugs were not so active in 1997 as 1996. 4. escherichia coli all drugs except penicillins were active against e. coli with the mic90s of 8 micrograms/ml or below. particularly, flomoxef (fmox), cefmenoxime (cmx), cefpirome (cpr), cefozopran (czop), ipm, cpfx and tflx showed the highest activities against e. coli with the mic90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 5. klebsiella pneumoniae k. pneumoniae was susceptible to  almost all the drugs except penicillins. carumonam (crmn) had the strongest activity with the mics for all strains equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. fmox, cpr, czop, cpfx and tflx were also active with the mic90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. the mic90s of quinolones had changed into a better state in 1997, compared with those in 1996. 6. proteus mirabilis almost all the drugs except abpc and mino showed high activities against p. mirabilis. cmx, ceftazidime (caz), latamoxef (lmox), cpr, cefixime (cfix), cefpodoxime (cpdx) and crmn showed the highest activities against p. mirabilis. the mics of them for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. cpfx and tflx were also active with the mic90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 7. pseudomonas aeruginosa  the mic90 of gm was 8 micrograms/ml, the mic90s of amk, ipm and meropenem (mepm)  were 16 micrograms/ml. the others were not so active against p. aeruginosa with the mic90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. the mic90s of quinolones had changed into a lower state in 1997, compared with those in 1996. 8. serratia marcescens ipm showed the highest activity against s. marcescens. its mic90 was 2 micrograms/ml. gm was also active with the mic90 of 4 micrograms/ml. the mic90s of the others were 16 micrograms/ml or above. the mic50s of crmn was 0.125 microgram/ml or below, the mic50s of cpr and czop were 0.25 microgram/ml.

TI  == bloodstream infections in a neonatal intensive-care unit: 12 years' experience with an antibiotic control program.
AB  == objective: to assess the prevalence of gram-positive coccal (gpc), gram-negative  bacillary (gnb), and fungal blood-stream infections (bsis) during a 12-year period in which a consistent antibiotic treatment protocol was in place; to evaluate the efficacy of these antibiotic policies in relation to treatment, to the emergence of bacterial or fungal resistance, and to the occurrence of infection outbreaks or epidemics. study design: case series. methods: demographic, clinical, and bacteriological information from 363 infants born during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997 who developed 433 blood-culture-proven bsis was analyzed. early-onset bsis were defined as those infections discovered within 48 hours of birth, and late-onset bsis as those that occurred thereafter. suspected early-onset bsis were treated with ampicillin and  gentamicin, and suspected late-onset bsis with vancomycin and gentamicin. antibiotics were changed on the basis of organism antimicrobial susceptibility. results: early-onset bsis were noted in 52 of 21,336 live births and 40 of 20,402 live births during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997, respectively. gpc (83% due to group b streptococcus [gbs]) accounted for approximately one half of  early-onset bsi cases and gnb (68% enterobacteriaceae) for the remainder. early-onset gbs declined from 24 to 11 cases (p=.04) and late-onset bsi increased from 111 to 230 cases (p<.01) from the first to the last study period. sixty-eight percent of late-onset bsis were due to gpc (primarily coagulase-negative staphylococcus), 18% to gnb, and 14% to fungus. over the study period, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from the newborn intensivecare unit (unlike those strains from other hospital units) remained fully susceptible to ceftazidime and  gentamicin. although the hospitalwide prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus increased, all 17 newborn bsi cases were due to methicillin-sensitive strains. prevalence of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus increased, although all strains remained vancomycin-susceptible, as did the 16 enterococcus faecalis isolates. all fungi recovered (from 48 patients) were susceptible to amphotericin. conclusion: we observed a decrease in the prevalence of early-onset bsis due to gbs and an increase in late-onset bsis due to gpc, gnb, and fungi. the combination of ampicillin and gentamicin for suspected early-onset bsis and vancomycin and gentamicin for late-onset bsis has been successful for treatment of individual patients without the occurrence of infection outbreaks or the emergence of resistance. controlled antibiotic programs and periodic evaluations based on individual unit and not on hospitalwide antibiograms are advisable.

TI  == asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy: epidemiological, clinical and microbiological approach.
AB  == asymptomatic urinary tract infection is a risk factor for fetal and maternal morbidity including development of pyelonephritis, premature labor and impaired intra-uterine development. in this study, 326 pregnant and 100 non-pregnant control women were screened for significant asymptomatic bacteriuria from april 8 to july 25, 1997 to gain insight into the prevalence rate, clinical characteristics of the disease and microbiological assessments of the causative agents. all the subjects were clinically identified to have no signs and symptoms of urinary tract infection (uti). the age ranges of the study and control groups  were between 15-40 years for both groups with mean of 25.1 and 25.3 years, respectively. bacteriological screening of mid-stream urine (msu) revealed that 24/326 (7%) and 3/100 (3%) were positive for asymptomatic bacteriuria in the study group and controls, respectively (p < 0.05). further biochemical species identification showed that escherichia coli was found in 11/24 (46%) followed by  coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) in 8/24 (33%) and citrobacter freundii in  2/24 (8%). others found in smaller number included staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae and proteus rettgeri in 1/24 (4%) each. antimicrobial susceptibility test revealed that 10/11 (91%) of the e. coli isolates were resistant to ampicillin and amoxicillin and 10/11 (91%) of them sensitive to nitrofurantoin.

TI  == stool microflora in extremely low birthweight infants.
AB  == aim: to serially characterise aerobic and anaerobic stool microflora in extremely low birthweight infants and to correlate colonisation patterns with clinical risk factors. methods: stool specimens from 29 infants of birthweight <1000 g were collected on days 10, 20, and 30 after birth. quantitative aerobic and anaerobic  cultures were performed. results: by day 30, predominant species were enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterbacter  cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus haemolyticus. lactobacillus and bifidobacteria spp were identified in only one infant. in breast milk fed (but not in formula fed) infants, the total number of bacterial species/stool specimen increased significantly with time (2.50 (se 0.34) on day 10; 3.13 (0.38) on day 20; 4.27 (0.45) on day 30) as did quantitative bacterial counts; gram negative species accounted for most of the increase. on day 30, significant inverse correlations were found between days of previous antibiotic treatment and number of bacterial species (r=0.491) and total organisms/g of stool (r=0.482). gestational age, birthweight, maternal antibiotic or steroid treatment, prolonged rupture of the membranes, and mode of delivery did not seem to affect colonisation patterns. conclusions: the gut of extremely low birthweight infants  is colonised by a paucity of bacterial species. breast milking and reduction of antibiotic exposure are critical to increasing fecal microbial diversity.

TI  == cloning, sequence analyses, expression, and distribution of ampc-ampr from morganella morganii clinical isolates.
AB  == shotgun cloning experiments with restriction enzyme-digested genomic dna from morganella morganii 1, which expresses high levels of cephalosporinase, into the  pbkcmv cloning vector gave a recombinant plasmid, ppon-1, which encoded four entire genes: ampc, ampr, an hybf family gene, and orf-1 of unknown function. the deduced ampc beta-lactamase of pi 7.6 shared structural and functional homologies with ampc from citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, enterobacter cloacae, and serratia marcescens. the overlapping promoter organization of ampc and ampr, although much shorter in m. morganii than in the other enterobacterial species, suggested similar ampr regulatory properties. the  mics of beta-lactams for e. coli mc4100 (ampc mutant) harboring recombinant plasmid pacyc184 containing either ampc and ampr (pac-1) or ampc (pac-2) and induction experiments showed that the ampc gene of m. morganii 1 was repressed in the presence of ampr and was activated when a beta-lactam inducer was added. moreover, transformation of m. morganii 1 or of e. coli jrg582 (delta ampde) harboring ampc and ampr with a recombinant plasmid containing ampd from e. cloacae resulted in a decrease in the beta-lactam mics and an inducible phenotype for m. morganii 1, thus underlining the role of an ampd-like protein in the regulation of the m. morganii cephalosporinase. fifteen other m. morganii clinical isolates with phenotypes of either low-level inducible cephalosporinase  expression or high-level constitutive cephalosporinase expression harbored the same ampc-ampr organization, with the hybf and orf-1 genes surrounding them; the  organization of these genes thus differed from those of ampc-ampr genes in c. freundii and e. cloacae, which are located downstream from the fumarate operon. finally, an identical ampc beta-lactamase (dha-1) was recently identified as being plasmid encoded in salmonella enteritidis, and this is confirmatory evidence of a chromosomal origin of the plasmid-mediated cephalosporinases.

TI  == cloning and expression in escherichia coli of an azoreductase gene from clostridium perfringens and comparison with azoreductase genes from other bacteria.
AB  == a genomic library of clostridium perfringens atcc 3626 was constructed in phage lambda gt11 and screened with an antibody against the c. perfringens azoreductase, which catalyzes the reduction of azo dyes to aromatic amines. a positive recombinant phage, containing a 3.8 kb dna fragment insert was selected  and purified. lytic and lysogenic escherichia coli cultures infected with the recombinant phage had higher azoreductase activity than cultures infected only with the vector lambda gt11. the 3.8 kb dna fragment was amplified by pcr and found to hybridize with one band from c. perfringens dna digested with ecor1, indicating the presence of a single copy of the azoreductase gene. the fragment also hybridized with dna from other azoreductase-producing clostridium species, a eubacterium sp., enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter amalonaticus and e. coli, but  not with dna from some other species of anaerobic bacteria capable of reducing azo dyes. the data indicate that the sequence of the azoreducatse gene of c. perfringens is conserved in some anaerobes and facultative anaerobes, but not in  others, and that different types of azoreductase genes must be found in other anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == structure-function studies of ser-289 in the class c beta-lactamase from enterobacter cloacae p99.
AB  == site-directed mutagenesis of ser-289 of the class c beta-lactamase from enterobacter cloacae p99 was performed to investigate the role of this residue in beta-lactam hydrolysis. this amino acid lies near the active site of the enzyme,  where it can interact with the c-3 substituent of cephalosporins. kinetic analysis of six mutant beta-lactamases with five cephalosporins showed that ser-289 can be substituted by amino acids with nonpolar or polar uncharged side chains without altering the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. these data suggest that ser-289 is not essential in the binding or hydrolytic mechanism of ampc beta-lactamase. however, replacement by lys or arg decreased by two- to threefold the kcat of four of the five beta-lactams tested, particularly cefoperazone, cephaloridine, and cephalothin. three-dimensional models of the mutant beta-lactamases revealed that the length and positive charge of the side chain of lys and arg could create an electrostatic linkage to the c-4 carboxylic  acid group of the dihydrothiazine ring of the acyl intermediate which could slow  the deacylation step or hinder release of the product.

TI  == in vivo activities of peptidic prodrugs of novel aminomethyl tetrahydrofuranyl-1  beta-methylcarbapenems.
AB  == a series of novel aminomethyl tetrahydrofuranyl (thf)-1 beta-methylcarbapenems which have excellent broad-spectrum antibacterial activities exhibit modest efficacies against acute lethal infections (3.8 mg/kg of body weight against escherichia coli and 0.9 mg/kg against staphylococcus aureus) in mice when they are administered orally. in an effort to improve the efficacies of orally administered drugs through enhanced absorption by making use of a peptide-mediated transport system, several different amino acids were added at the aminomethyl thf side chains of the carbapenem molecules. the resulting peptidic prodrugs with l-amino acids demonstrated improved efficacy after oral administration, while the d forms were less active than the parent molecules. after oral administration increased (3 to 10 times) efficacy was exhibited with the alanine-, valine-, isoleucine-, and phenylalanine-substituted prodrugs against acute lethal infections in mice. median effective doses (ed50s) of < 1 mg/kg against infections caused by s. aureus, e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, or penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae were obtained after the administration of single oral doses. several of the peptidic prodrugs were efficacious against morganella morganii, serratia marcescens, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae, and e. coli infections, with ed50s of 1 to 14 mg/kg by oral administration compared with ed50s of 14 to > 32 mg/kg for the parent molecules. in general, the parent molecules demonstrated greater efficacy than the prodrugs against these same infections when the drugs were administered by the subcutaneous route. the parent molecule was detectable in the sera of mice after oral administration of the peptidic prodrugs.

TI  == high turnover rate of escherichia coli strains in the intestinal flora of infants in pakistan.
AB  == the escherichia coli flora of infants in developed countries is dominated by one  or a few strains which persist for prolonged periods of time, but no longitudinal studies have been performed in developing countries. to this end, we studied the  rectal enterobacterial flora in 22 home-delivered pakistani infants during their  first 6 months of life. three colonies were isolated and species typed on each of 11 sampling occasions. e. coli isolates were strain typed using electromorphic typing of cytoplasmic enzymes, and their o serogroups were determined. there was  a very rapid turnover of enterobacterial strains in the rectal flora of individual infants. on average, 8.5 different e. coli strains were found per infant, and several biotypes of other enterobacteria. less than 50% of the infants were colonized with e. coli from their mothers, but strains of maternal origin were four times more likely to persists in the infants' flora than other e. coli strains. enterobacteria other than e. coli were always of non-maternal origin, and enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae biotypes recovered from contaminated feeds were later identified in the infants' rectal flora. an early colonization with klebsiella or enterobacter was significantly associated with diarrhoea during the neonatal period, although these bacteria were not likely to be the cause of the disease. the results suggest that poor hygienic conditions result in an unstable and diverse enterobacterial flora, which may influence infant health.

TI  == in vitro activity of meropenem against common pathogenic bacteria isolated in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in taiwan. meropenem was active against most gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis. for many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. it is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. it is uncommon for these common bacteria, except mrsa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to  other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.

TI  == changes in the incidence and etiological patterns of bacteremia associated with acute leukemia over a 25-year period.
AB  == during the 25-year period from 1972-1996, 360 episodes of bacteremia occurred in  248 (45%) of a total of 548 patients with acute leukemia on our hematology ward,  with the rate of occurrence remaining almost unchanged. patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, however, had a significant decrease in the incidence of  bacteremia during the last 5-year period. gram-negative bacilli decreased in relative frequency from 64% for the first 15-year period to 40% for the last 5-year period, whereas gram-positive cocci increased from 24% to 51%. escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae somewhat decreased in frequency, whereas coagulase-negative staphylococci and streptococci had considerable increases. in  contrast, pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated at a relatively constant frequency, forming one of the top two pathogens throughout the study period. despite the shift toward gram-positive cocci, therefore, p. aeruginosa remains a key organism in considering the initial empiric antibiotic regimen and infection prevention during neutropenia.

TI  == characterization of sfo-1, a plasmid-mediated inducible class a beta-lactamase from enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == enterobacter cloacae 8009 produced an inducible class a beta-lactamase which hydrolyzed cefotaxime efficiently. it also hydrolyzed other beta-lactams except cephamycins and carbapenems. the activity was inhibited by clavulanic acid and imipenem. the bla gene was transferable to escherichia coli by electroporation of plasmid dna. the molecular mass of the beta-lactamase was 29 kda and its pi was 7.3. all of these phenotypic characteristics of the enzyme except for inducible production resemble those of some extended-spectrum class a beta-lactamases like  fec-1. the gene encoding this beta-lactamase was cloned and sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequence of the beta-lactamase was homologous to the ampa sequences of the serratia fonticola chromosomal enzyme (96%), men-1 (78%), klebsiella oxytoca chromosomal enzymes (77%), toho-1 (75%), and fec-1 (72%). the  conserved sequences of class a beta-lactamases, including the s-x(t)-x(s)-k motif, in the active site were all conserved in this enzyme. on the basis of the  high degree of homology to the beta-lactamase of s. fonticola, the enzyme was named sfo-1. the ampr gene was located upstream of the ampa gene, and the ampr sequence of sfo-1 had homology with the ampr sequences of the chromosomal beta-lactamases from citrobacter diversus (80%), proteus vulgaris (68%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (60%). sfo-1 was also inducible in e. coli. however, a transformant harboring plasmid without intact ampr produced a small amount of beta-lactamase constitutively, suggesting that ampr works as an activator of ampa of sfo-1. this is the first report from japan describing an inducible plasmid-mediated class a beta-lactamase in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == mechanism of inhibition of tannic acid and related compounds on the growth of intestinal bacteria.
AB  == tannic acid, propyl gallate and methyl gallate, but not gallic acid, were found to be inhibitory to the growth of intestinal bacteria bacteroides fragilis atcc 25285, clostridium clostridiiforme atcc 25537, c. perfringens atcc 13124, c. paraputrificum atcc 25780, escherichia coli atcc 25922, enterobacter cloacae atcc 13047, salmonella typhimurium ta98 and s. typhimurium yg1041 at 100-1000 microg/ml in culture broth. neither bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697 nor lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 was inhibited by any of the above compounds up to 500 microg/ml. tannic acid has a much greater relative binding efficiency to iron than propyl gallate, methyl gallate or gallic acid. the inhibitory effect of tannic acid to the growth of intestinal bacteria may be due to the strong iron binding capacity of tannic acid; whereas the effect of propyl gallate and methyl  gallate probably occurs by a different mechanism. the growth of e. coli was restored by the addition of iron to the medium after the precipitate caused by tannic acid was removed. neither b. infantis nor l. acidophilus require iron for  growth. this probably contributes to their resistance to tannic acid. because tannins are abundant in the human diet, tannins may affect the growth of some intestinal bacteria and thus may have an impact on human health.

TI  == a six-domain structural model for escherichia coli translation initiation factor  if2. characterisation of twelve surface epitopes.
AB  == the escherichia coli translation initiation factor if2 is a 97 kda protein which  interacts with the initiator fmet-trnafmet, gtp and the ribosomal subunits during initiation of protein biosynthesis. for structural and functional investigations  of the factor, we have raised and characterised monoclonal antibodies against e.  coli if2. twelve epitopes have been localised at the surface of the protein molecule by three different methods: interactions of the monoclonal antibodies with nested deletion mutants of if2, comparison of the relative location of the epitopes in a competition immunoassay and cross-reactivity analyses of the monoclonal antibodies towards if2 from salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, proteus vulgaris, and bacillus stearothermophilus. these data are combined with predicted secondary structure and discussed in relation to a six-domain structural model for if2. the model describes if2 as a slightly elongated molecule with a structurally compact c-terminal domain, a well-conserved central gtp-binding domain, and a highly charged, solvent exposed  n-terminal with protruding alpha-helical structures.

TI  == isolation and characterization of acc deaminase genes from two different plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria.
AB  == we have recently proposed that one way that plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria  (pgpr) stimulate plant growth is through the activity of the enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (acc) deaminase, which causes a lowering of plant ethylene levels resulting in longer roots. as part of an effort to understand the role of this enzyme in pgpr, the genes for acc deaminase from two  pgpr, enterobacter cloacae cal2 and uw4, have been isolated. these genes are highly homologous to the acc deaminase genes from pseudomonas strains 6g5 and f17 and similar to the acc deaminase gene from pseudomonas sp. strain acp. the region downstream (i.e., at the 3'-terminal end) of the strain uw4 acc deaminase gene has a potential hairpin-like transcription termination site. the regions upstream of the strains uw4 and cal2 acc deaminase genes contain putative ribosome-binding sites; however, the promoter sequences have not yet been identified. southern hybridization experiments suggest that there is a single copy of the acc deaminase gene in enterobacter cloacae strains uw4 and cal2 and that there may be several different types of acc deaminase genes in different microbes. the cloned  acc deaminase gene can be expressed in escherichia coli enabling this bacterium to grow on acc as a sole source of nitrogen and confers upon both escherichia coli and pseudomonas spp. strains that are transformed with this gene the ability to promote the elongation of the roots of canola seedlings.

TI  == three-dimensional structure of ampc beta-lactamase from escherichia coli bound to a transition-state analogue: possible implications for the oxyanion hypothesis and for inhibitor design.
AB  == the structures of ampc beta-lactamase from escherichia coli, alone and in complex with a transition-state analogue, have been determined by x-ray crystallography.  the native enzyme was determined to 2.0 a resolution, and the structure with the  transition-state analogue m-aminophenylboronic acid was determined to 2.3 a resolution. the structure of ampc from e. coli resembles those previously determined for the class c enzymes from enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii. the transition-state analogue, m-aminophenylboronic acid, makes several interactions with ampc that were unexpected. perhaps most surprisingly, the putative "oxyanion" of the boronic acid forms what appears to be a hydrogen bond  with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of ala318, suggesting that this atom is protonated. although this interaction has not previously been discussed, a carbonyl oxygen contact with the putative oxyanion or ligand carbonyl oxygen appears in most complexes involving a beta-lactam recognizing enzyme. these observations may suggest that the high-energy intermediate for amide hydrolysis by beta-lactamases and related enzymes involves a hydroxyl and not an oxyanion, although the oxyanion form certainly cannot be discounted. the involvement of the main-chain carbonyl in ligand and transition-state recognition is a distinguishing feature between serine beta-lactamases and serine proteases, to which they are often compared. ampc may use the interaction between the carbonyl  of ala318 and the carbonyl of the acylated enzyme to destabilize the ground-state intermediate, this destabilization energy might be relieved in the transition state by a hydroxyl hydrogen bond. the structure of the m-aminophenylboronic acid adduct also suggests several ways to improve the affinity of this class of inhibitor and points to the existence of several unusual binding-site-like features in the region of the ampc catalytic site.

TI  == structure-based enhancement of boronic acid-based inhibitors of ampc beta-lactamase.
AB  == the expression of beta-lactamases is the most common form of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. to combat these enzymes, agents that inhibit (e.g. clavulanic acid) or evade (e.g. aztreonam) beta-lactamases have been developed. both the beta-lactamase inhibitors and the beta-lactamase-resistant antibiotics are themselves beta-lactams, and bacteria have responded to these compounds by expressing variant enzymes resistant to inhibition (e.g. irt-3) or that inactivate the beta-lactamase-resistant antibiotic (e.g. tem-10). moreover, these compounds have increased the frequency of bacteria with intrinsically resistant beta-lactamases (e.g. ampc). in an effort to identify non-beta-lactam-based beta-lactamase inhibitors, we used the crystallographic structure of the m-aminophenylboronic acid-escherichia coli ampc beta-lactamase complex to suggest modifications that might enhance the affinity of boronic acid-based inhibitors for class c beta-lactamases. several types of compounds were modeled into the ampc binding site, and a total of 37 boronic acids were ultimately tested for beta-lactamase inhibition. the most potent of these compounds, benzo[b]thiophene-2-boronic acid (36), has an affinity for e. coli ampc of 27 nm. the wide range of functionality represented by these compounds allows for the steric and chemical "mapping" of the ampc active site in the region of the catalytic ser64 residue, which may be useful in subsequent inhibitor discovery efforts. also, the new boronic acid-based inhibitors were found to potentiate the activity of beta-lactam antibiotics, such as amoxicillin and ceftazidime, against bacteria expressing class c beta-lactamases. this suggests that boronic acid-based compounds may serve as leads for the development of therapeutic agents for the treatment of beta-lactam-resistant infections.

TI  == the prognostic factors of adult gram-negative bacillary meningitis.
AB  == seventy-seven patients with gram-negative bacillary meningitis (gnbm), 57 males and 20 females, aged 17-86 years, were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital, over an 11-year period. fifty-four infections were community-acquired, and 23 were nosocomial; 49 were spontaneous and 28 occurred after head surgery or neurosurgery. the organisms most frequently involved were klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter. rarer pathogens included citrobacter species, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus mirabilis. all patients who did not receive appropriate antibiotic therapy died. the mortality in those treated with appropriate antibiotics was 28%. other statistically significant prognostic factors included septic shock, initial level of consciousness, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic coma, disseminated intravascular coagulation, high cerebrospinal fluid lactate levels and leucocytosis. in the multiple logistic regression analysis, only appropriate antimicrobial therapy and septic shock were strongly associated with mortality even after adjusting for other potentially confounding factors. despite the high mortality, management can be improved by early diagnosis, early use of appropriate antibiotics, and correction of underlying and associated medical derangement.

TI  == [antibiotic sensitivity to isolated bacteria in pediatric urinary tract infections].
AB  == of the childhood urinary tract infections, more than 50% are caused by escherichia coli (e coli), followed by proteus mirabilis (p mirabilis), klebsiella sp, other enterobacteria, enterococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococci. of e coli isolates, 50 to 60% are resistant to ampicillin (ampi-r), 10% being susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (amc). for p mirabilis, ampi-r isolates are less frequent and more often susceptible to amc. klebsiella sp is resistant to ampicillin, 75% of isolates being susceptible to amc. in these three species, the susceptibility of isolates to third generation cephalosporins, aminogly-cosides, and ciprofloxacin is still high (> 90%), but 15 to 35% are resistant to cotrimoxazole. in the other enterobacteria (enterobacter  cloacae, morganella morganii, p vulgaris, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens) the resistance to cefalotin (hence to ampicillin and amc) is permanent, with an exception: the susceptibility of p vulgaris to amc. enterococci are mostly susceptible to ampicillin, and p aeruginosa to ceftazidime, but in both species, the percentage of resistant strains in hospitalised patients is greater than in outpatients. for staphylococcus aureus,  the community-acquired isolates are susceptible to oxacillin and other anti-staphylococcal agents. all the coagulase negative staphylococci isolates are susceptible to vancomycin, but 70% of those from hospitalised patients are resistant to oxacillin, aminoglycosides and cotrimoxazole.

TI  == bacteraemia in the adult intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in nottingham, uk, 1985-1996.
AB  == bacteraemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit. in this study the distribution of organisms causing bacteraemic episodes in patients in the adult intensive care unit of a large teaching hospital was determined. particular emphasis was placed on the type of organisms  isolated from community- and hospital-acquired bacteraemia, the suspected source  of infection, the possible risk factors associated with bacteraemia, and outcome. the incidence of bacteraemia and fungaemia increased from 17.7 per 1000 admissions in 1985 to 80.3 in 1996. a total of 315 episodes of bacteraemia and fungaemia were documented over a 12-year period, of which 18% were considered community-acquired and 82% hospital-acquired. gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 46.9% and 31.5% of the episodes, respectively. polymicrobial infection accounted for 17.8% and fungi for 3.8% of the episodes. staphylococcus aureus (22.5%), staphylococcus epidermidis (7.6%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (7.9%) were the predominant gram-positive bacteria implicated, whereas escherichia coli (6%), enterobacter cloacae (7%), klebsiella  aerogenes (3.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.1%), and acinetobacter spp. (3.8%) were the predominant gram-negative bacteria isolated. the two most common sources of infection were the respiratory tract (39.7%) and an intravascular line (24.5%), but in 8.9% of episodes the focus of infection remained unknown. bacteraemic patients stayed in the unit for a longer period (12 days) than did non-bacteraemic patients (3 days). the overall mortality related to bacteraemia and candidaemia was 44.4%. surveillance of bacteraemia in the intensive care unit is important in detecting major changes in aetiology, e.g., the increasing incidence of gram-positive bacteraemia, the emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in 1995, and the emergence of enterobacter cloacae. it is of value in determining empirical antimicrobial therapy to treat presumed infection pending a microbiological diagnosis and in directing the development of guidelines for infection prevention, e.g., guidelines for central venous catheter care.

TI  == gyra mutations associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in eight species of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == fluoroquinolone resistance (fq-r) in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae species has been reported with increasing frequency in recent years. two mechanisms of fq-r have been identified in gram-negative organisms: mutations in  dna gyrase and reduced intracellular drug accumulation. a single point mutation in gyra has been shown to reduce susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. to determine the extent of gyra mutations associated with fq-r in enteric bacteria, one set of oligonucleotide primers was selected from conserved sequences in the flanking regions of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdr) of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. this set of primers was used to amplify and sequence the qrdrs from 8 enterobacteriaceae type strains and 60 fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical isolates of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, providencia stuartii, and serratia marcescens. although similarity of the nucleotide sequences of seven species ranged from 80.8 to 93.3%, when compared with that of e. coli, the amino acid sequences of the gyra qrdr were highly conserved. conservative amino acid substitutions were detected in the qrdrs of the susceptible type strains of c. freundii, e. aerogenes, k. oxytoca (ser-83 to  thr), and p. stuartii (asp-87 to glu). strains with ciprofloxacin mics of >2 microg/ml expressed amino acid substitutions primarily at the gly-81, ser-83, or  asp-87 position. fluoroquinolone mics varied significantly for strains exhibiting identical gyra mutations, indicating that alterations outside gyra contribute to  resistance. the type and position of amino acid alterations also differed among these six genera. high-level fq-r frequently was associated with single gyra mutations in all species of enterobacteriaceae in this study except e. coli.

TI  == direct antimicrobial susceptibility testing of gram-negative bacilli in blood cultures by an electrochemical method.
AB  == nonfastidious aerobic gram-negative bacilli (gnb) are commonly isolated from blood cultures. the feasibility of using an electrochemical method for direct antimicrobial susceptibility testing of gnb in positive blood cultures was evaluated. an aliquot (10 microliter) of 1:10-diluted positive blood cultures containing gnb was inoculated into the bactometer module well (biomerieux vitek,  hazelwood, mo.) containing 1 ml of mueller-hinton broth supplemented with an antibiotic. susceptibility tests were performed in a breakpoint broth dilution format, with the results being categorized as resistant, intermediate, or susceptible. seven antibiotics (ampicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, amikacin, cefamandole, cefotaxime, and ciprofloxacin) were used in this study, with each agent being tested at the two interpretive breakpoint concentrations. the inoculated modules were incubated at 35 degreesc, and the change in impedance in  each well was continuously monitored for 24 h by the bactometer. the mics of the  seven antibiotics for each blood isolate were also determined by the standardized broth microdilution method. of 146 positive blood cultures (1,022 microorganism-antibiotic combinations) containing gnb tested by the direct method, the rates of very major, major, and minor errors were 0, 1.1, and 2.5%, respectively. the impedance method was simple; no centrifugation, preincubation,  or standardization of the inocula was required, and the susceptibility results were normally available within 3 to 6 h after inoculation. the rapid method may allow proper antimicrobial treatment almost 30 to 40 h before the results of the  standard methods are available.

TI  == the in vitro bactericidal effect of microwave energy on bacteria that cause prostatitis.
AB  == objectives: we investigated the in vitro nonthermal effects of microwaves delivered from prostatron 2.0 on escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae. methods: the fingers of powder-free, sterile gloves were ligated, and bacterial solutions were transferred into the remaining area of the glove. the gloves were  then sealed using silk ligatures. one set of gloves was subjected to the microwave treatment while another set was placed in a temperature-matched waterbath to act as control samples. the gloves containing the treatment group were taped around the probe, at the site where microwave energy exits the probe.  during the treatment period, the temperatures from the urethral probe and the rectal probe were carefully monitored. results: the mean (+/-sd) energy delivered was 46.6 +/- 9.5 kj (range 30.0 to 59.5) for the 10 trials on e. coli and colony  counts in the experimental microwaved gloves decreased significantly compared with control samples (5.26 +/- 4.5 x 10(5) versus 10.16 +/- 9.3 x 10(5) cfu/ml, p = 0.02). for the experiments on e. cloacae the mean (+/-sd) energy applied was 38.5 +/- 12.5 kj, and a significant decrease in colony counts of microwaved samples was also observed compared with controls (11.04 +/- 4.8 x 10(5) versus 20.08 +/- 10.1 x 10(5) cfu/ml, p = 0.004). conclusions: microwave energy, delivered from prostatron 2.0, independent of heat production has an in vitro bactericidal effect on laboratory-cultured e. coli and e. cloacae.

TI  == radiological pulmonary changes during gram-negative bacillary nosocomial bloodstream infection in premature infants.
AB  == objective: the objective of the study was to characterize the changes that occur  in chest radiographs at the time of gram-negative bacilli (gnb) nosocomial bloodstream infection (bsi) and to determine the contribution of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) and airway gram-negative bacterial pathogens to the clinical diagnosis of gnb nosocomial pneumonia. study design: this retrospective investigation involved 41 bsi infants (study group) and 50 gnb airway colonized infants who had sepsis workup with negative blood cultures (control group). we correlated clinical findings (95 blood and 305 tracheal aspirate (ta) cultures) with radiographic findings noted within 2 days before, the day of, and the day after blood cultures. two radiologists independently graded 258 films using a modified score for bpd and a semiquantitative score ("probable," "possible," or "unlikely") for pneumonia. results: mean birth weight was 1057 gm and 1044 gm for the study and control groups, respectively. of the study population, 54% were male, 21% were black, 89% received surfactant, 79% received dexamethasone, and 88% survived. average age at the time of blood cultures for both groups was 23 days. most common isolates from blood and ta were klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. eight bsi infants died, mainly as a result of p. aeruginosa and k. pneumoniae; three control patients also died. radiological findings were that bpd scores did not change in relation to bsi and were similar between study and control groups. of the bsi patients, 21 presented with newly positive ta at the time of positive blood culture; "probable" or "possible" pneumonia was diagnosed in 18 of them. their bpd scores were higher than those of the remaining bsi patients, of whom seven were already airway colonized, nine had negative tas, and four were not intubated. only one of these 20 patients had "possible" pneumonia noted on chest  x-ray films. conclusion: radiographic signs of air space disease accompanied by the recovery of gnb respiratory pathogens from the blood and from a previously uncolonized airway strongly support the clinical diagnosis of gnb nosocomial pneumonia. radiological signs of bpd are stable in relation to nosocomial bsi caused by gnb, but bpd radiological scores are higher among infants who also had  a newly acquired respiratory gnb. bsi, new respiratory tract gnb, and bpd are critical associations for the clinical interpretation of radiographic changes in  the ventilated newborn.

TI  == purification and characterization of wild-type and mutant "classical" nitroreductases of salmonella typhimurium. l33r mutation greatly diminishes binding of fmn to the nitroreductase of s. typhimurium.
AB  == "classical" nitroreductase of salmonella typhimurium is a flavoprotein that catalyzes the reduction of nitroaromatics to metabolites that are toxic, mutagenic, or carcinogenic. this enzyme represents a new class of flavin-dependent enzymes, which includes nitroreductases of enterobacter cloacae  and escherichia coli, flavin oxidoreductase of vibrio fischeri, and nadh oxidase  of thermus thermophilus. to investigate the structure-function relation of this class of enzymes, the gene encoding a mutant nitroreductase was cloned from s. typhimurium strain ta1538nr, and the enzymatic properties were compared with those of the wild-type. dna sequence analysis revealed a t to g mutation in the mutant nitroreductase gene, predicting a replacement of leucine 33 with arginine. in contrast to the wild-type enzyme, the purified protein with a mutation of leucine 33 to arginine has no detectable nitroreductase activities in the standard assay conditions and easily lost fmn by dialysis or ultrafiltration. in  the presence of an excess amount of fmn, however, the mutant protein exhibited a  weak but measurable enzyme activity, and the substrate specificity was similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. possible mechanisms by which the mutation greatly diminishes binding of fmn to the nitroreductase are discussed.

TI  == trends in beta-lactam resistance among enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == beta-lactam resistance among enterobacteriaceae is related primarily to the emergence of novel beta-lactamases. the class a extended-spectrum beta-lactamases hydrolyze extended-spectrum beta-lactams and are inhibited by clavulanic acid. these beta-lactamases are divided in two groups: tem and shv derivatives and non-tem and non-shv extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ctx-m1, ctx-m2, men-1, per-1, per-2, toho-1, and veb-1). the plasmid-mediated cephalosporinases (mir-1,  fox-1, mox-1, bil-1, cmy-1, cmy-2, and lat-1) hydrolyze extended-spectrum cephalosporins and cephamycins and are not inhibited by clavulanic acid. they have been reported in europe and in the united states. the 15 inhibitor-resistant penicillinases are tem derivatives (except for shv-10) and plasmid mediated, and  they are mainly from escherichia coli isolates. the carbapenemases noted among enterobacteriaceae are either the chromosomally located penicillinases (sme-1, nmca, imi-1) found in rare enterobacter cloacae or serratia marcescens isolates or the plasmid-mediated metalloenzyme imp-1 that is widespread in japan. the incidence of resistance among enterobacteriaceae related to the other more common beta-lactam-resistance mechanisms has continued to rise worldwide.

TI  == induction of beta-lactamase in enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == beta-lactamase induction in enterobacter cloacae, which is linked to peptidoglycan recycling, was investigated with use of high-performance liquid chromatography of cell wall fragments in genetically defined cells of escherichia coli. after treatment of cells with beta-lactams, we detected in the periplasm an increase of d-tripeptide (n-acetylglucosaminyl-1,6 anhydro n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid), d-tetrapeptide (n-acetylglucosaminyl-1, 6 anhydro n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid -d-alanine), and a yet-unknown anhydromuropeptide. we identified this anhydromuramylpeptide by fast  atom bombardment-mass spectrometry as anhydromuramyl-pentapeptide. the amount of  these molecules did not alter after treatment with cell wall-active non beta-lactams. the transmembrane protein ampg transports not only d-tripeptide but also d-pentapeptide into the cell. in the cytoplasm these molecules are degraded  into the corresponding monosaccharide peptides m-tripeptide (n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid) and m-pentapeptide (n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid-alanine-d-alanine). these findings indicate that besides m-tripeptide and d-tripeptide, probably m-tetrapeptide, d-tetrapeptide, m-pentapeptide, and d-pentapeptide are also signal muropeptides for beta-lactamase induction.

AB  == background: cefepime is a new, parenteral, fourth-generation antibiotic that is stable in the presence of bush group 1 beta-lactamases. in vitro activity of cefepime, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and imipenem against gram-positive cocci and cefuroxime-resistant gram-negative bacilli was studied. methods: the agar dilution method described by the us national committee for clinical laboratory standards was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics tested. these included cefepime, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and imipenem. the tested clinical isolates included gram-positive cocci (methicillin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci, methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, viridans streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, group d enterococci) and cefuroxime-resistant gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter spp, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, burkholderia cepacia and xanthomonas maltophilia). results:  the activity of cefepime against most gram-negative bacilli other than b cepacia  and x maltophilia is better than that of ceftazidime. however, cefepime is less active against these gram-negative bacilli than ciprofloxacin and imipenem. the activity of cefepime against b cepacia and x maltophilia is less than that of ceftazidime or ciprofloxacin. among gram-positive cocci, cefepime was active against most isolates of methicillin-sensitive staphylococci, s pyogenes, viridans streptococci and s pneumoniae. however, cefepime has poor activity against methicillin-resistant s aureus and enterococci. conclusions: due to its extended spectrum of activity, cefepime has potential use as suitable empiric monotherapy for the treatment of a variety of community- and hospital-acquired infections.

TI  == aerobic degradation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by enterobacter cloacae pb2 and by pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase.
AB  == enterobacter cloacae pb2 was originally isolated on the basis of its ability to utilize nitrate esters, such as pentaerythritol tetranitrate (petn) and glycerol  trinitrate, as the sole nitrogen source for growth. the enzyme responsible is an  nadph-dependent reductase designated petn reductase. e. cloacae pb2 was found to  be capable of slow aerobic growth with 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (tnt) as the sole nitrogen source. dinitrotoluenes were not produced and could not be used as nitrogen sources. purified petn reductase was found to reduce tnt to its hydride-meisenheimer complex, which was further reduced to the dihydride-meisenheimer complex. purified petn reductase and recombinant escherichia coli expressing petn reductase were able to liberate nitrogen as nitrite from tnt. the ability to remove nitrogen from tnt suggests that pb2 or recombinant organisms expressing petn reductase may be useful for bioremediation  of tnt-contaminated soil and water.

TI  == bacteremia in patients with hematologic malignancies.
AB  == the decision regarding the appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy for bacteremia in patients with hematologic malignancies must be individualized in each institution, by taking into account variations in the patterns of microbial  isolates and their resistance profiles. microbial isolates and antibiotic resistance patterns must be taken into account at each hospital. a shift from bacteremia due to infections caused by predominantly gram-negative organisms to predominantly gram-positive organisms in patients with hematologic malignancies has been noted in reports from other countries. we investigated bacterial isolates and their antibiotic sensitivities in patients with hematologic malignancies in the veterans general hospital-taipei. a total of 185 episodes of  bacteremia in 140 patients with hematologic malignancies were recorded during the period from 1995 to 1996. unlike foreign reports, our investigation shows that gram-negative organisms still predominate, accounting for 72.7% of isolates, followed by gram-positive organisms, accounting for 26.3% of isolates, and anaerobes, accounting for 1% of isolates. escherichia coli was the most commonly  isolated organism, accounting for 23.9% of isolates, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (18.5%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.2%), enterobacter cloacae (7.3%),  and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (7.3%). a high mortality rate was observed in gram-negative bacteremia: 31% for e. coli, 26% for k. pneumoniae, 24% for p. aeruginosa, and 33% for e. cloacae. if methicillin-resistant s. aureus bacteremia occurred, mortality was high (47%). the antibiotic sensitivity profiles of the four most common gram-negative isolates (e. coli, k. pneumoniae,  p. aeruginosa, and e. cloacae) indicated that, in our hospital, amikacin with either cefoperazone, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, or imipenem, would be an ideal combination for empirical therapy for bacteremia in patients with hematologic malignancies.

AB  == the frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 680 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (utis) in 10 hospitals during the period of june 1996 to may 1997. of  the above bacterial isolates, gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.4% and a majority of them were enterococcus faecalis. gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.6% and most of them were escherichia coli. susceptabilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. enterococcus faecalis ampicillin (abpc) showed the highest activity against e. faecalis isolated from patients with utis. its mic90 was 1 microgram/ml. imipenem (ipm) and vancomycin (vcm) were also active with the mic90s of 2 micrograms/ml. the others had low activities with the mic90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. staphylococcus aureus including mrsa arbekacin (abk) and vcm showed the highest activities against both s. aureus and mrsa isolated from patients with utis. the  mic90s of them were 1 or 2 micrograms/ml. the others except minocycline (mino) had low activities with the mic90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 3. staphylococcus epidermidis abk and vcm showed the strongest activities against s. epidermis isolated from patients with utis. the mics for all strains were equal to or lower than 2 micrograms/ml. cefazolin (cez), cefotiam (ctm) and cefozopran  (czop) were also active with the mic90s of 4 micrograms/ml. compared with antimicrobial activities of cephems is 1995, the mic90s of them had changed into  a better state. they ranged from 4 micrograms/ml 16 micrograms/ml in 1996. 4. streptococcus agalactiae all drugs except mino were active against s. agalactiae. abpc, czop, ipm, and clarithromycin (cam) showed the highest activities. the mics for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 micromilligrams. tosufloxacin (tflx) and vcm were also active with the mic90s of 0.5 micromilligrams. 5. citrobacter freundii gentamicin (gm) showed the highest activity against c. freundii isolated from patients with utis. its mic90 was 0.5 micrograms/ml. ipm and amikacin (amk) were also active with the mic90s of 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. cefpirome (cpr) and czop were also active with the mic90s of 8 micrograms/ml. the mic90s of the others were 16 micrograms/ml or above. 6. enterobacter cloacae ipm showed the highest activity against e. cloacae. the mics for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. the mic90s of ciprofloxacin (cpfx) and tflx were 1 microgram/ml, the mic90 of amk was 2 micrograms/ml, the mic90s of czop, gm and ofloxacin (oflx) were 4 micrograms/ml. the mic50s of cephems except cez, cefmetazole (cmz) and cefaclor (ccl) had changed into a better state in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 7. escherichia coli all drugs except penicillins and mino were active against e. coli. particularly cpr, czop and ipm showed the highest activities against e. coli. the mic90s of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. among e. coli strains, those with low susceptibilities to cephems except cez, cefoperazone (cpz), latamoxef (lmox) and ccl have increased in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 8.  klebsiella pneumoniae k. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with the mic90s of 2 micrograms/ml or below. cpr had the strongest activity, the mics for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.25 microgram/ml. flomoxef (fmox), cefixime (cfix), czop and carumonam (crmn) were also active with the mic90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 9. pseudomonas aeruginosa all drugs except quinolones were not so active against p. aeruginosa with the mic90s were 32 micrograms/ml or above. quinolones were more active in 1996 than 1995. the mic90s of them were between 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml, and the mic50s of them were between 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml. 10. serratia marcescens  gm showed the highest activity against s. marcescens. its mic90 was 1 micro

TI  == [survey of the sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  == research groups were formed in 21 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance. the activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems were tested against clinical isolates collected from these institutions. the broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,282 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at all institutions between october and  december 1995. the results were as follows: 1. carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against mssa and streptococcus pneumoniae. their activities against enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of abpc. carbapenems showed low activities against mrsa. 2. oflx exhibited the greatest antibacterial activity against haemophilus influenzae, followed by mepm. the antibacterial activities of the other carbapenems were comparable to those of fmox and ctm. 3. the carbapenems showed high activities against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and bacteroides fragilis group. their activities were greater than that exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents. the carbapenems also exhibited greater antibacterial activities against serratia marcescens than the other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains were detected. 4. the antibacterial activities of carbapenems against pseudomonas aeruginosa were comparable to those of caz, azt, amk.

TI  == dna-dependent rna polymerase from enterobacter cloacae is closely related to escherichia coli.
AB  == the rna polymerase holoenzyme (rnap) of enterobacter cloacae was purified by gel  filtration and heparin affinity chromatography and shown to consist of four subunits (beta', beta, alpha and sigma) of 156, 151, 45 and 82 kda, as measured by sds-page. the 82 kda protein was shown to be related to the escherichia coli primary sigma factor by western blot analysis with polyclonal antisera raised against purified e. coli sigma 70. functional reconstitution of e. cloacae core enzyme with purified e. coli sigma 70 showed that e. cloacae and e. coli sigma factors are closely related. the rnap of e. cloacae initiated transcription from  the tac promoter with an efficiency similar to that of e. coli. measuring promoter-specific transcription, the dependence of holoenzyme activity on salt, divalent cation and temperature was also similar to that of the e. coli rnap. we  also showed that the transcriptional inhibitor, rifampicin, inhibits the enzyme activity of the purified rnap of e. cloacae and e. coli at similar concentrations. we conclude, based on these data, that the rnap of e. cloacae and e. coli, both enterobacteria, are closely related.

TI  == [in vitro antibacterial activities of cefteram and other beta-lactam agents against recent clinical isolates].
AB  == in vitro antibacterial activity of the third-generation oral cephem cefteram (cftm)--ten years after its first use in the clinical setting--against recent clinical isolates was evaluated and compared with those of other oral cephems. a  total of 851 clinical isolates belonging to 13 species used in this study were collected from five medical institutions across japan during 1996. cftm showed excellent antibacterial activity against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus and s. pyogenes, equivalent to those of other third-generation oral cephems, except cefixime. of the s. pneumoniae strains, a high proportion, 34.1%, were penicillin-resistant strains (prsp), with mic values of 2.0 micrograms/ml or above, but the mic50 of cftm against prsp was 1.0 microgram/ml. cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems showed potent antibacterial activity against  e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis. a few strains of e. coli, however, were highly resistant to third-generation oral cephems; that might include extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains. mic values against p. vulgaris varied significantly, depending on whether they were determined by the broth micro-dilution method or the agar dilution method; growth was observed at high concentrations in the broth micro-dilution method, in which the skip phenomenon was demonstrated, but not in the agar dilution method. the reason for  this discrepancy is unknown. most strains of s. marcescens, c. freundii, and e. cloacae demonstrated resistance to cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems. cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems showed excellent antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, n. gonorrhoeae, and h. influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains.

TI  == in-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of cfc-222, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == cfc-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. the in-vitro and in-vivo activities of cfc-222 were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and sparfloxacin. against gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus (quinolone-susceptible and quinolone-resistant), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis, cfc-222 was more active than ciprofloxacin and similar to  sparfloxacin. against gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, the in-vitro activity of cfc-222 was similar to that of sparfloxacin, but less than that of ciprofloxacin. however, it was less active than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. in mouse systemic infection caused by s. aureus smith or s. aureus tms 33, cfc-222 demonstrated an activity similar  to that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, but better than that of ofloxacin. the compound was more effective than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin in murine infection caused by streptococcus pyogenes atcc 8668. against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae infections, the efficacy of cfc-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin. the activity of cfc-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against p. aeruginosa mb4-16 in the same infection model. these results suggest that cfc-222 may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of various bacterial infections.

TI  == [occurrence and susceptibility of hospital strains producing enzymes with a wide  spectrum of substrate profiles].
AB  == in connection with more and more frequent occurrence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases an effort has been made to detect their presence in the biological materials coming from the patients of different wards of mining hospital in sosnowiec from january to september 1995. among 38 diagnostic materials, from which the strains in question were isolated, the following materials have been examined: bronchial lavage (52.6%), surgical wounds (18.4%),  urines (15.8%) and others (13.2%). the examined diagnostic materials came from intensive care unit (87.0%), casualty and orthopaedic surgery clinic (5.0%) and general surgery clinic (3.0%). the most frequently isolated microorganisms were klebsiella pneumoniae. (47.4%), serratia marcescens (36.8%), enterobacter cloacae (10.5%) and others (5.3%). half of the examined strains constituted those producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases and probably possessing an extra resistance mechanism: (serratia marcescens--74%, enterobacter cloacae--21%, enterobacter aerogenes--5.0%) and 50% were those producing extended--spectrum beta-lactamases. (klebsiella pneumoniae--95%, escherichia coli--5%). susceptibility of the examined strains to anti-microbial antibiotics was diverse. full susceptibility of the analysed strains has been observed exclusively in case of karbapenems (imipenem, meropenem and cefamycyn). in case of beta-lactamase with beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations susceptibility was diverse and dependent on the species of the examined microorganism.

TI  == immuno-detection of the virulence determinant ompx at the cell surface of enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == a model for the topology of the enterobacter cloacae outer membrane protein ompx  has been proposed, based on the primary sequence and on analogy to homologous proteins. according to this model the membrane embedded part of the protein consists of eight antiparallel beta-strands. four random coil loops are located at the bacterial surface and three beta-turns at the periplasmic side of the membrane. antibodies were raised against synthetic peptides representing five ompx domains, four of which are putative peripheral and one located in the membrane. the accessibilities of ompx to these antibodies were tested in intact cells by immuno-gold electron microscopy. this study showed that ompx is indeed an outer membrane protein, the n-proximal loop of which forms an igg-accessible epitope at the cell surface.

TI  == bacterial and ureaplasma colonization of the airway: radiologic findings in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  == objective: we designed this retrospective study to compare radiologic findings in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) in whom gram-positive cocci (gpc), gram-negative bacilli (gnb), or ureaplasma urealyticum were colonized. another objective was to correlate the radiologic findings of these patients with the clinical severity of bpd. study design: we correlated serial tracheal aspirates with radiographic findings from 183 infants whose birth weight was < or = 1250 gm. bpd severity was assessed by oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age (36 w pca) and at the time of discharge. two radiologists independently scored films taken at birth and 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days of life. results: of the study population, 55% were male and 35% were black; 80% received surfactant and 69% received dexamethasone; 91% survived. gpc isolates from throat cultures were mainly staphylococcus [corrected] epidermidis and streptococcus haemolyticus. a superimposed gnb colonization was present in 37% of these infants. most common isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and escherichia coli. sepsis caused by gpc developed in 16% of all patients; 7% had sepsis caused by gnb. infants infected with gnb remained receiving oxygen at 36 w pca and at the time of discharge twice as often as those noninfected. radiologic findings: hyperinflation, interstitial changes, and generalized or localized emphysema were prominent features throughout. mean radiologic scores increased over time in a pattern similar among gpc, gnb, and u. urealyticum infected and noninfected infants. high radiologic scores were not predictive at any time of infants who needed supplemental oxygen at 28 days and at 36 w pca. infants infected with u. urealyticum were neither clinically nor radiologically different than noncolonized neonates. conclusion: gpc, gnb, and u. urealyticum airway colonization is not associated with particular radiographic changes at any time. gnb-infected infants had the most severe bpd course, and yet they were radiologically indistinguishable from the other patients. u. urealyticum colonization does not result in more clinically severe bpd or demonstrate a unique radiologic course.

TI  == dna shuffling of a family of genes from diverse species accelerates directed evolution.
AB  == dna shuffling is a powerful process for directed evolution, which generates diversity by recombination, combining useful mutations from individual genes. libraries of chimaeric genes can be generated by random fragmentation of a pool of related genes, followed by reassembly of the fragments in a self-priming polymerase reaction. template switching causes crossovers in areas of sequence homology. our previous studies used single genes and random point mutations as the source of diversity. an alternative source of diversity is naturally occurring homologous genes, which provide 'functional diversity'. to evaluate whether natural diversity could accelerate the evolution process, we compared the efficiency of obtaining moxalactamase activity from four cephalosporinase genes evolved separately with that from a mixed pool of the four genes. a single cycle  of shuffling yielded eightfold improvements from the four separately evolved genes, versus a 270- to 540-fold improvement from the four genes shuffled together, a 50-fold increase per cycle of shuffling. the best clone contained eight segments from three of the four genes as well as 33 amino-acid point mutations. molecular breeding by shuffling can efficiently mix sequences from different species, unlike traditional breeding techniques. the power of family shuffling may arise from sparse sampling of a larger portion of sequence space.

TI  == [penetration of meropenem in gram-negative bacilli. differences in activity with  imipenem].
AB  == the outer membrane of gramnegative bacteria cell-wall contain channels formed by  proteins known as porins, which facilitate the penetration of molecules into the  cell. imipenem and meropenem possess an important intrinsic activity against most gramnegative bacteria due to their high affinity for the penicillin-binding proteins pbp-2 and/or pbp-3. meropenem is slightly more active against certain species of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and nonfermenters bacilli.  in this sense the differences in the activity between the two carbapenems may be  attributable to differences in their affinity for pbps, differences in their resistance to beta-lactamases hydrolysis, or to the differences in the capacity to employ certain porin channels. oprf is the main porin channel involved in the  beta-lactam penetration of bacteria, though oprc and oprd2 may also contribute to the penetration of carbapenems into p. aeruginosa. however, evidences suggest that although impenem requires the presence of oprd2, meropenem may use other pathways for penetration. in escherichia coli both carbapenems use ompf and ompc, and no specific porin channels have been detected. only in the case of enterobacter cloacae may exceptions exists among enterobacteriaceae.

AB  == we cloned a fragment of the chromosomal dna of enterobacter cloacae, which enabled a melibiose-negative escherichia coli mutant lacking melb to grow on melibiose as the sole source of carbon. transformed cells harboring the hybrid plasmid carrying the cloned dna showed melibiose transport activity. the nucleotide sequence of the dna region was determined. one complete open reading frame (orf) and a part of another orf were found in the region, and the amino acid sequences were deduced. the complete orf was found to encode a melibiose transporter which consisted of 425 amino acid residues. hydropathy analysis revealed that there are about 12 hydrophobic domains in this transporter. the incomplete orf which exists in the upstream region of the transporter gene seemed to encode an alpha-galactosidase.

TI  == detection of mutations in the gyra and parc genes in quinolone-resistant clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == we have determined partial sequences of the gyra and parc genes of enterobacter cloacae type strain including the regions analogous to the quinolone resistance-determining region of the escherichia coli gyra gene. the deduced 65-  and 49-amino acid sequences of the determined regions of the e. cloacae gyra and  parc genes were identical to the corresponding regions of the e. coli gyra and parc proteins, respectively. we examined 40 clinical strains of e. cloacae isolated from patients with urinary tract infection for susceptibilities to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin. based on the nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin mics, these isolates were divided into 19 quinolone-susceptible strains (mics of  nalidixic acid, 3.13-25 mg/l; mics of ciprofloxacin, < or = 0.025 mg/l) and 21 quinolone-resistant strains (mics of nalidixic acid, 400 to > 800 mg/l; mics of ciprofloxacin, 0.39-100 mg/l). we analysed five quinolone-susceptible and 21 quinolone-resistant strains for alterations in gyra and parc. the five quinolone-susceptible strains had amino acid sequences in gyra and parc identical to those of type strain. of the 21 quinolone-resistant isolates, three (mics of nalidixic acid, 400 to > 800 mg/l; mics of ciprofloxacin, 0.39-3.13 mg/l) had a single amino acid change at the position equivalent to ser-83 in the e. coli gyra protein and no alterations in parc; one (mic of nalidixic acid, > 800 mg/l; mic of ciprofloxacin, 3.13 mg/l) had a single amino acid change at ser-83 in gyra and a single amino acid change at the position equivalent to glu-84 in the e. coli parc protein; two (mic of nalidixic acid, > 800 mg/l; mic of ciprofloxacin, 25 mg/l) had double amino acid changes at ser-83 and asp-87 in gyra and no alterations in parc; and 15 (mics of nalidixic acid, > 800 mg/l; mics of ciprofloxacin, 25-100 mg/l) had double amino acid changes at ser-83 and asp-87 in gyra and a single amino acid change at ser-80 or glu-84 in parc. this study suggests, that in clinical isolates of e. cloacae, dna gyrase is a primary target of quinolones, that only a single amino acid change at ser-83 in gyra is sufficient to generate high-level resistance to nalidixic acid and to decrease susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, and that the accumulation of amino acid changes  in gyra and the simultaneous presence of the parc alterations play a central role in developing high-level resistance to ciprofloxacin.

AB  == glycerol trinitrate (gtn) reductase, which enables agrobacterium radiobacter to utilize gtn and related explosives as sources of nitrogen for growth, was purified and characterized, and its gene was cloned and sequenced. the enzyme was a 39-kda monomeric protein which catalyzed the nadh-dependent reductive scission  of gtn (km = 23 microm) to glycerol dinitrates (mainly the 1,3-isomer) with a ph  optimum of 6.5, a temperature optimum of 35 degrees c, and no dependence on metal ions for activity. it was also active on pentaerythritol tetranitrate (petn), on  isosorbide dinitrate, and, very weakly, on ethyleneglycol dinitrate, but it was inactive on isopropyl nitrate, hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene, ammonium ions, nitrate, or nitrite. the amino acid sequence deduced from the dna sequence was homologous (42 to 51% identity and 61  to 69% similarity) to those of petn reductase from enterobacter cloacae, n-ethylmaleimide reductase from escherichia coli, morphinone reductase from pseudomonas putida, and old yellow enzyme from saccharomyces cerevisiae, placing  the gtn reductase in the alpha/beta barrel flavoprotein group of proteins. gtn reductase and petn reductase were very similar in many respects except in their distinct preferences for nadh and nadph cofactors, respectively.

AB  == new pyrrolidine derivatives, which bear an alkyloxime substituent in the 4-position and an aminomethyl substituent in the 3-position of the pyrrolidine ring, have been synthesized and coupled with various quinolinecarboxylic acids to produce a series of new fluoroquinolone antibacterials. these fluoroquinolones were found to possess potent antimicrobial activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, including methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). variations at the c-8 position of the quinolone nucleus included fluorine, chlorine, nitrogen, methoxy, and hydrogen atom substitution. the activity imparted to the substituted quinolone nucleus by the c-8 substituent was in the order f (c5-nh2) > f (c5-h) > naphthyridine > cl = ome = h against gram-positive organisms. in the case of gram-negative strains, activity was in the order f (c5-nh2) > naphthyridine = f (c5-h) > h > cl > ome. the advantages provided by the newly introduced oxime group of the quinolones were clearly demonstrated by their comparison to a desoximino compound 30. in addition, the oxime moiety greatly improved the pharmacokinetic parameters of the novel quinolones. among these compounds, compound 20 (lb20304) showed the best in vivo  efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile in animals, as well as good physical properties. the mics (microgram/ml) of lb20304, compound 30, and ciprofloxacin against several test organisms are as follows: s. aureus 6538p (0.008, 0.031, and 0.13), methicillin resistant s. aureus 241 (4, 16, and 128), streptococcus epidermidis 887e (0.008, 0.016, and 0.13), methicillin resistant s. epidermidis 178 (4, 32, and 128), enterococcus faecalis 29212 (0.063, 0.13, and 1), pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e (0.25, 0.5, and 0.13), escherichia coli 3190y (0.008, 0.016, and 0.008), enterobacter cloacae p99 (0.008, 0.031, and 0.008), actinobacter calcoaceticus 15473 (0.063, 0.13, and 0.25). on the basis of these promising results, lb20304 was selected as a candidate for further evaluation.

TI  == mechanism of suppression of piperacillin resistance in enterobacteria by tazobactam.
AB  == resistance to piperacillin in several isolates of citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae was investigated and confirmed to occur at a frequency of 10(-7) to 10(-6). development of resistance to piperacillin was significantly suppressed by tazobactam but not by clavulanic acid. to elucidate the mechanism by which resistance suppression occurs, the effect of piperacillin plus tazobactam on the induction of ampc beta-lactamase was analyzed by monitoring the beta-galactosidase activity of an inducible ampc-lacz gene fusion in escherichia  coli. the combination exerted no inhibitory effect on ampc beta-lactamase induction. tazobactam also had no effect on the accumulation of a key intermediate in the ampc beta-lactamase induction pathway, 1,6-anhydromurotripeptide, in an ampd mutant strain of e. coli. however, the addition of tazobactam to liquid cultures of e. cloacae 40001 in the presence of  piperacillin at four times the mic caused a delay in the recovery of the culture  to piperacillin-induced stress. at 16 times the mic, a complete suppression of regrowth occurred. analysis of culture viability on piperacillin plates showed that the culture recovery was due to growth by moderately resistant mutants preexisting in the cell population, which at 16 times the mic became susceptible  to the combination. evidence from the kinetics of inhibition of the e. cloacae 40001 ampc beta-lactamase by clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and tazobactam and from  the effects of these drugs on the frequency of resistance to piperacillin suggests that the suppressive effect of tazobactam on the appearance of resistance is primarily mediated by the beta-lactamase inhibitory activity.

TI  == the signal molecule for beta-lactamase induction in enterobacter cloacae is the anhydromuramyl-pentapeptide.
AB  == beta-lactamase induction in enterobacter cloacae, which is linked to peptidoglycan recycling, was investigated by high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis of cell wall fragments in genetically defined cells of escherichia coli. after treatment of cells with beta-lactams, we detected an increase in a d-tripeptide (disaccharide-tripeptide, n-acetylglucosaminyl-1,6-anhydro-n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-glutamyl-mes o-diaminopimelic acid), ad-tetrapeptide (disaccharide-tetrapeptide, n-acetylglucosaminyl-1,6-anhydro-n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-glutamyl-mes o-diaminopimelic acid-d-alanine), and ad-pentapeptide (disaccharide-pentapeptide, n-acetylglucosaminyl-1,6-anhydro-n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-glutamyl-mes o-diaminopimelic acid-d-alanyl-d-alanine)levels in the periplasms of bacterial cells. furthermore, only the accumulation of ad-pentapeptide correlates with the  beta-lactamase-inducing capacity of the beta-lactam antibiotic. the transmembrane protein ampg transports all three ad-peptides into the cytoplasm, where they are  degraded into the corresponding monosaccharide peptides. in the absence of ampd the constitutive overproduction of beta-lactamase is accompanied by an accumulation of am-tripeptide (monosaccharide-tripeptide, anhydro-n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid) and am-pentapeptide (l1,6-anhydro-n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid-d-alanyl-d-alanine), but not am-tetrapeptide (anhydro-n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid-d-alanine), in the cytoplasm. only the amount of am-pentapeptide is increased upon treatment  with imipenem. these findings indicate that ad-pentapeptide is the main periplasmic muropeptide, which is converted into the cytoplasmic signal molecule  for beta-lactamase induction, the am-pentapeptide.

AB  == enterobacter cloacae has been implicated as one of the causative agents in neonatal infection and causes a septicemia thought to be initiated via the gastrointestinal tract. the adhesion of radiolabeled e. cloacae to ht-29 cells was concentration and temperature dependent and was effectively blocked by unlabeled bacteria or by millimolar concentrations of alpha-mannosides and micromolar concentrations of high-mannose oligosaccharides. a variety of well-characterized mannose oligosaccharides were tested as inhibitors of adhesion. the best inhibitor was the man9(glcnac)2-tyrosinamide, which was considerably better than other tyrosinamide-linked oligosaccharides such as man7(glcnac)2, man6(glcnac)2 or man5(glcnac)2. further evidence that the bacteria preferred man9(glcnac)2 structures was obtained by growing ht-29 cells in the presence of glycoprotein processing inhibitors that block mannosidase i and increase the amount of protein-bound man9(glcnac)2 at the cell surface. such cells bound 1.5- to 2-fold more bacteria than did control cells. the adhesin involved in binding to high-mannose structures was purified from isolated pili. on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gels, a 35-kda protein was identified by its specific binding to a mannose-containing biotinylated albumin. the amino acid sequences of several peptides from the 35-kda subunit showed over 85% identity to fimh, the mannose-specific adhesin of salmonella typhimurium. pili were labeled with 125i and examined for the ability to bind to ht-29 cells. binding showed saturation kinetics and was inhibited by the addition of man9(glcnac)2-tyrosinamide but not  by oligosaccharides with fewer mannose residues. polyclonal antibody against this 35-kda protein also effectively blocked adhesion of pili or e. cloacae, but no effect was observed with nonspecific antibody. these studies demonstrate that the 35-kda pilus subunit is a lectin whose specificity is directed toward man, (glcnac)2 oligosaccharides.

TI  == induction of gram-negative bacterial growth by neurochemical containing banana (musa x paradisiaca) extracts.
AB  == bananas contain large quantities of neurochemicals. extracts from the peel and pulp of bananas in increasing stages of ripening were prepared and evaluated for  their ability to modulate the growth of non-pathogenic and pathogenic bacteria. extracts from the peel, and to a much lesser degree the pulp, increased the growth of gram-negative bacterial strains escherichia coli o157:h7, shigella flexneri, enterobacter cloacae and salmonella typhimurium, as well as two non-pathogenic e. coli strains, in direct relation to the content of norepinephrine and dopamine, but not serotonin. the growth of gram-positive bacteria was not altered by any of the extracts. supplementation of vehicle and pulp cultures with norepinephrine or dopamine yielded growth equivalent to peel cultures. total organic analysis of extracts further demonstrated that the differential effects of peel and pulp on bacterial growth was not nutritionally based, but due to norepinephrine and dopamine. these results suggest that neurochemicals contained within foodstuffs may influence the growth of pathogenic and indigenous bacteria through direct neurochemical-bacterial interactions.

TI  == reductive and hydrolytic activities of enteric bacteria on food colours.
AB  == reductive and hydrolytic activities on two food colours namely metanil yellow and indigo carmine by different strains of enteric bacteria were evaluated. enteric bacteria possessed both reductive and hydrolytic capabilities which depended upon the incubation period and the type of strain. in certain bacterial strains, (escherichia coli and vibrio sp.), reductive activity was visible after 3 hr. other enteric strains showed an increasing activity right from the beginning of incubation. enterobacter cloacae appeared to be producing maximum reductive capability followed by enterobacter aerogenes and e. coli. even enteric bacterial strains demonstrated a good response in obtaining hydrolytic activity of indigo carmine during incubation upto 10 hr, establishing the fact that the gut microflora may cause health problem to consumers.

TI  == [survey of sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  == research groups were formed in 20 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance of clinical isolates. activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems, were tested against clinical isolates collected  from these institutions. the broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,326 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at the institutions between october and  december 1994. the results are as follows: 1. carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against mssa and streptococcus pneumoniae. their activities against enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of abpc. carbapenems showed low activities against mrsa. 2. oflx exhibited the greatest antibacterial activity against haemophilus influenzae, followed by mepm. antibacterial activities of the other carbapenems were comparable to those of fmox, ctm, and abpc. 3. the carbapenems showed high activities against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and bacteroides fragilis group. their activities were greater than those exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents. the carbapenems also exhibited stronger antibacterial activities against serratia marcescens than the other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains were detected. 4. the antibacterial activities of carbapenems against pseudomonas aeruginosa were comparable to those of caz, azt, amk.

TI  == effects of requiring prior authorization for selected antimicrobials: expenditures, susceptibilities, and clinical outcomes.
AB  == antimicrobial control programs are widely used to decrease drug expenditures, but effects on antimicrobial resistance and outcomes for patients are unknown. when a requirement for prior authorization for selected parenteral antimicrobial agents  was initiated at our urban, county teaching hospital, total parenteral antimicrobial expenditures decreased by 32%. susceptibilities to all beta-lactam  and quinolone antibiotics increased, with dramatic increased susceptibilities in  isolates recovered in intensive care units, increased susceptibilities in isolates recovered in other inpatient sites, and little change in susceptibilities in isolates recovered in outpatient sites despite no change in infection control practices. for patients with bacteremia due to gram-negative organisms, overall survival did not change with restrictions. no differences occurred in the median time from initial positive blood culture to receipt of an  appropriate antibiotic or in the median time from positive blood culture to discharge from the hospital. thus, requiring preapproval for selected parenteral  agents can decrease antimicrobial expenditures and improve susceptibilities to antibiotics without compromising patient outcomes or length of hospital stay.

TI  == development of an antimicrobial susceptibility testing method suitable for performance during space flight.
AB  == very little is known regarding the effects of the microgravity environment of space flight upon the action of antimicrobial agents on bacterial pathogens. this study was undertaken to develop a simple method for conducting antibacterial susceptibility tests during a space shuttle mission. specially prepared susceptibility test research cards (biomerieux vitek, hazelwood, mo.) were designed to include 6 to 11 serial twofold dilutions of 14 antimicrobial agents,  including penicillins, cephalosporins, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, vancomycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. mics of the drugs were determined by visual reading of color end points in the vitek research cards made possible by incorporation of a colorimetric growth indicator (alamarblue; accumed international, westlake, ohio). this study has demonstrated reproducible susceptibility results in the testing of isolates of staphylococcus aureus, group a streptococcus species, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli (beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains), klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in some instances, the mics were comparable to those determined by a standard broth microdilution method, while in some cases the unique test media and format yielded slightly different values that were themselves reproducible. the proposed in-flight experiment will  include inoculation of the vitek cards on the ground prior to launch of the space shuttle, storage of inoculated cards at refrigeration temperature aboard the space shuttle until experiment initiation, and then incubation of the cards for 18 to 48 h prior to visual interpretation of mics by the mission's astronauts. ground-based studies have shown reproducible mics following storage of inoculated cards for 7 days at 4 to 8 degrees c to accommodate the mission's time schedule and the astronaut's activities. for comparison, ground-based control (normal gravity) mic values will be generated by simultaneous inoculation and incubation  of a second set of test cards in a laboratory at the launch site. this procedure  can provide for a safe and compact experiment that should yield new information on the effects of microgravity on the biological activities of various classes of antibiotics.

TI  == construction, expression, and activities of l49-sfv-beta-lactamase, a single-chain antibody fusion protein for anticancer prodrug activation.
AB  == the l49 (igg1) monoclonal antibody binds to p97 (melanotransferrin), a tumor-selective antigen that is expressed on human melanomas and carcinomas. a recombinant fusion protein, l49-sfv-bl, that contains the antibody binding regions of l49 fused to the enterobacter cloacae r2-1 beta-lactamase (bl) was constructed, expressed, and purified to homogeneity in an escherichia coli soluble expression system. the variable regions of l49 were cloned by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from l49 hybridoma mrna using signal sequence and constant region primers. construction of the gene encoding l49-sfv-bl was accomplished by hybridization insertion of vh, vl, and sfv linker  sequences onto a pet phagemid template containing the bl gene fused to the pelb leader sequence. optimal soluble expression of l49-sfv-bl in e. coli was found to take place at 23 degrees c with 50 microm isopropyl beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside  induction and the use of the nonionic detergent nonidet p-40 for isolation from the bacteria. construction and expression of a soluble form of the p97 antigen in chinese hamster ovary cells allowed affinity-based methods for analysis and purification of the fusion protein. surface plasmon resonance, fluorescent activated cell sorting, and michaelis-menten kinetic analyses showed that l49-sfv-bl retained the antigen binding capability of monovalent l49 as well as the enzymatic activity of bl. in vitro experiments demonstrated that l49-sfv-bl bound to 3677 melanoma cells expressing the p97 antigen and effected the activation of 7-(4-carboxybutanamido)cephalosporin mustard (ccm), a cephalosporin nitrogen mustard prodrug. on the basis of these results, l49-sfv-bl was injected  into nude mice with subcutaneous 3677 tumors, and localization was determined by  measuring bl activity. tumor to blood conjugate ratios of 13 and 150 were obtained 4 and 48 h post conjugate administration, respectively, and the tumor to liver, spleen, and kidney ratios were even higher. a chemically produced l49-fab'-bl conjugate yielded a much lower tumor to blood ratio (5.6 at 72 h post administration) than l49-sfv-bl. therapy experiments established that well-tolerated doses of l49-sfv-bl/ccm combinations resulted in cures of 3677 tumors in nude mice. the favorable pharmacokinetic properties of l49-sfv-bl allowed prodrug treatment to be initiated 12 h after the conjugate was administered. thus, l49-sfv-bl appears to have promising characteristics for site-selective anticancer prodrug activation.

TI  == microbial growth inside saline-filled breast implants.
AB  == in vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to determine whether intraluminal saline in breast implants can support the growth of common wound-infecting microorganisms over a prolonged period of time. the bacteria tested were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, corynebacterium jeikeium, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. three fungal species also were tested: aspergillus fumigatus, paecilomyces variotii, and candida albicans. in the in vitro study, four organisms survived in flasks of sterile saline for the 2 weeks in which serial cultures were performed: k. pneumoniae, c. albicans, a. fumigatus, and p.  variotii. in the in vivo study, 61 white rabbits (122 implants) received both an  experimental implant inoculated with one of the test organisms and a control implant containing only sterile saline. they were sacrificed at 1-, 3-, or 6-month scheduled endpoints. none of the control implants containing sterile saline had positive cultures. in contrast, the intraluminal saline was culture positive for 7 of the 10 inoculated organisms after varying lengths of time: s. epidermidis, e. coli, e. cloacae, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, a. fumigatus, and p. variotii. samples of capsular tissue also were cultured. of the 122 capsular tissue specimens, 21 (17 percent) had positive cultures and surrounded both inoculated and sterile implants. in most instances, capsules that were culture positive contained an organism different from the one that had been inoculated in the group. in only 3 cases was the same organism cultured from both the periprosthetic tissue and the intraluminal saline, and these may represent instances of the inoculated organism migrating through the implants filler valves. the data show that several types of bacteria (particularly gram-negative  species) and fungi can grow and reproduce in a restricted saline environment for  extended periods of time.

TI  == a monoclonal antibody reacts with maltose-binding protein of escherichia coli and related enteric bacteria.
AB  == maltose-binding protein (mbp) encoded by male is essential for the energy-dependent translocation of maltose through the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria. its property of specific binding to maltose has been used in constructing fusion proteins for easy affinity purification. a monoclonal antibody named mab sc1d7 was produced against escherichia coli mbp. this mab also bound to mbp-containing recombinant proteins in both western blotting and immunoprecipitation analysis. as a result, this mab can be a useful probe for tracing mbp-fusion proteins in various applications. furthermore, intrinsic mbps  from e. coli, shigella dysenteriae, salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter cloacae, and klebsiella pneumoniae were also detected by this mab. no reaction was observed with the total proteins from serratia marcescens, aeromonas hydrophila and plesiomonas shigelloides. these observations suggest that the mab sc1d7-defined epitope is conserved among some enteric bacteria, but not the others. the results strengthen the phylogenetic positions of these closely related bacteria previously placed by other means.

TI  == histopathology and microbiology of isolated rectal bleeding in neonates: the so-called 'ecchymotic colitis'.
AB  == rectal bleeding in neonates is an alarming event which suggests a possible necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) but is usually the only symptom of an unexplained colitis characterized endoscopically by ecchymotic mucosal lesions, the so-called 'ecchymotic colitis' (ec). we studied histologically and bacteriologically 18 infants (mean age: 18 days) presenting with rectal bleeding by systematic rectosigmoidoscopy and intestinal biopsies. the 18 infants were hospitalized. prematurity was found in seven cases and an underlying condition in 14 cases (respiratory distress: six cases; infection: six cases; surgery: two cases). histology showed a mild to moderate inflammation (10/12) of the mucosa with a prevalence of polymorphonuclear cells (8/10), frequent focal haemorrhages (11/12) and foci of pneumatosis (4/12). numerous bacteria were seen in the mucus layer focally forming large clusters. cultures of intestinal biopsies yielded exclusively enterobacteriaceae species: escherichia coli (seven cases), klebsiella spp. (seven cases), and enterobacter cloacae (three cases); four cases were sterile. our study demonstrates that neonatal bleeding is associated with endoscopic and histological 'ecchymotic colitis' lesions and with a peculiar microbial flora of ebc strains. ec and necrotizing enterocolitis share similar features raising the question of the link between the two syndromes.

(group ii), a free living amoeba species recovered from the wet area of a physiotherapy unit. pathogenic strains of acanthamoebae may cause amoebic-encephalitis (ae) and keratitis. light and electron microscopic examinations showed that in a first step, the bacterial were phagocytized by the  amoebae. in contrast to enterobacter cloacae and escherichia coli that were used  as food organisms and digested within food vacuoles, burkholderia pickettii caused the amoebae to develop large vacuoles filled with completely intact and motile bacteria. 3-5 days after infection, pseudomonas pickettii had multiplied within the enlarging parasitophorous vacuoles. ultrastructural changes in the host cells occurred and the amoebae finally underwent rupture or lysis. in cocultivation assays we could not only reinfect the original host amoeba but acanthamoeba strains from other habitats could successfully be infected with burkholderia pickettii as well.

TI  == imipenem resistance in klebsiella pneumoniae is associated with the combination of act-1, a plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase, and the foss of an outer membrane protein.
AB  == six escherichia coli and 12 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from a single hospital expressed a common beta-lactamase with a pi of approximately 9.0 and were resistant to cefoxitin and cefotetan (mic ranges, 64 to > 128 and 16 to > 128 micrograms/ml, respectively). seventeen of the 18 strains produced multiple beta-lactamases. most significantly, three k. pneumoniae strains were also resistant to imipenem (mics, 8 to 32 micrograms/ml). spectrophotometric beta-lactamase assays with purified enzyme indicated hydrolysis of cephamycins, in addition to cephaloridine and benzylpenicillin. the 4ene encoding the pi 9.0 beta-lactamase (designated act-1 for ampc type) was cloned and sequenced, which revealed an ampc-type beta-lactamase gene that originated from enterobacter cloacae and that had 86% sequence homology to the p99 beta-lactamase and 94% homology to the partial sequence of mir-1. southern blotting revealed that the gene encoding act-1 was on a large plasmid in some of the k. pneumoniae strains as well as on the chromosomes of all of the strains, suggesting that the gene is  located on an easily mobilized element. outer membrane protein profiles of the k. pneumoniae strains revealed that the three imipenem-resistant strains were lacking a major outer membrane protein of approximately 42 kda which was present  in the imipenem-susceptible strains. act-1 is the first plasmid-mediated ampc-type beta-lactamase derived from enterobacter which has been completely sequenced. this work demonstrates that in addition to resistance to cephamycins,  imipenem resistance can occur in k. pneumoniae when a high level of the act-1 beta-lactamase is produced in combination with the loss of a major outer membrane protein.

TI  == coexpression of the long and short forms of chea, the chemotaxis histidine kinase, by members of the family enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == chea is the histidine protein kinase of a two-component signal transduction system required for bacterial chemotaxis. motile cells of the enteric species escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium synthesize two forms of chea by utilizing in-frame initiation sites within the gene chea. the full-length protein, cheal, plays an essential role in the chemotactic signaling pathway. in  contrast, the function of the short form, cheas, remains elusive. although cheas  lacks the histidine residue that becomes phosphorylated in cheal, it exhibits both kinase activity and the ability to interact with and enhance the activity of chez, a chemotaxis protein that accelerates dephosphorylation of the two-component response regulator chey. to determine whether other members of the  family enterobacteriaceae express cheas and chez, we analyzed immunoblots of proteins from clinical isolates of a variety of enteric species. all motile, chemotactic isolates that we tested coexpressed cheal, cheas, and chez. the only  exceptions were closely related plant pathogens of the genus erwinia, which expressed cheal and chez but not cheas. we also analyzed nucleotide sequences of  the chea loci from isolates of serratia marcescens and enterobacter cloacae, demonstrating the presence of in-frame translation initiation sites similar to those observed in the chea loci of e. coli and s. typhimurium. since coexpression of cheas and chez appears to be limited to motile, chemotactic enteric bacteria,  we propose that cheas may play an important role in chemotactic responses in some environmental niches encountered by enteric species.

AB  == an in-vitro dialysis model was employed to assess the feasibility of once-daily dosing of cefodizime in the treatment of infections caused by various enterobacteriaceae: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, serratia marcescens, providencia stuartii and enterobacter cloacae. this model simulated the concentrations of cefodizime detected in human blood after an intravenous (i.v.) bolus injection of 1 g or 2 g of the antibiotic. validation of the model was undertaken to confirm its utility. based on the data obtained with  this model, once-daily dosing with 1 g cefodizime (i.v.) should be effective against infections due to the commonest gram-negative bacteria (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, m. morganii). for infections caused by enterobacteriaceae strains that produce large quantities of class i beta-lactamases, twice-daily (p. stuartii or s. marcescens) or four times daily (e. cloacae) administration of 1 g cefodizime may be required.

TI  == production of escherichia coli group i-like heat-labile enterotoxin by enterobacteriaceae isolated from environmental water.
AB  == strains of klebsiella oxytoca (2), citrobacter freundii (2), enterobacter cloacae (1) and escherichia coli (1) isolated from environmental water were identified as heat-labile enterotoxin (lt) producing strains by immunological methods and polymerase chain amplification. a 322 bp amplified fragment was obtained with specific primers ltr and ltl, and hybridized to a digoxigenin-labelled ltb probe  only under low stringency conditions, and not with a cholera toxin probe. these results suggest that enterobacteriaceae may produce a lt-like toxin antigenically and genetically related to the lt enterotoxin of e. coli.

AB  == in order to study the putative transfer of antibiotic resistance from poultry to  humans, hens' eggs were examined for the presence of various pathogens. staphylococcus, enterobacter, escherichia, proteus and pseudomonas spp. were the  most frequently isolated genera. sensitivity tests, performed with the kirby-bauer technique, showed the presence of resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus (to penicillin-g, tetracycline, erythromycin, clindamycin, cefalosporins,  oxacillin, gentamycin, chloramphenicol and tobramycin), enterococcus faecalis (to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, gentamycin and tetracyclin), escherichia  coli (to tetracycline, erythromycin, ampicillin and cefalosporins), enterobacter  cloacae (to ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavunalic acid, erythromycin and tetracycline), pseudomonas stutzeri (to erythromycin and chlorampenicol) and citrobacter freundii (to ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavunalic acid, cefalosporins and co-trimoxazole).

TI  == neonatal airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli: association with severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  == background: airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli (gnb) and gram-positive cocci (gpc) is common in mechanically ventilated neonates. whether  gnb are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (bsi) and/or to the severity  of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) is unknown. methods: we prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. data from 260 < or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated > or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. the severity of bpd was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. results: after 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with gpc (staphylococus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). superimposed on 36% of these infants was gnb airway colonization with klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), enterobacter cloacae (25%), escherichia coli (25%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), serratia marcescen (10%), acinetobacter baumannii and haemophilus influenzae (5%). comparison between 174 gpc- and 86 gnb-colonized infants showed  that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. fifteen percent of gnb-colonized infants developed bsi caused by gnb and 14% developed bsi caused by gpc. no significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and bsi was noted. gnb infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with gpc. gnb colonization was a predictor of severe bpd after controlling for ventilation. ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of gnb-colonized and 33% of noncolonized  infants and was not a predictor of bpd severity. conclusion: gnb airway colonization creates a moderate risk for bsi. antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate gnb. gnb airway colonization is associated with severe bpd, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate gnb from the airways should be undertaken.

TI  == growth promotion of mycobacterium avium-m. intracellulare complex by enterobacterial acetate.
AB  == a mycobacterial growth factor was present in the conditioned media of escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae cultures, but not in pseudomonas aeruginosa culture. this factor potentiated the growth of mycobacterium avium-m. intracellulare complex (mac), a patient isolate, and well-established strains of  m. avium and m. intracellulare. the growth factor was not a polypeptide; it was heat-stable and possessed a molecular weight < 500 d. acetate production by enterobacteria was responsible for the biological activities observed. acetate promoted mycobacterial growth at concentrations up to 3 mm; higher levels were toxic. the effects of acetate on mac growth were not influenced by the ph of the  media. our data suggest that production of acetate by enterobacteria may regulate mycobacterial growth, and therefore, intestinal acetate might be a cofactor in the pathogenicity of mac.

TI  == evaluation of swirling, ph, and glucose tests for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: although infrequent, episodes of transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis may lead to serious outcomes or death and therefore are of concern. this study evaluates the sensitivity of three surrogate tests for the presence of bacteria in platelet concentrates: cessation of swirling, low extracellular ph, and low plasma glucose levels. study design and methods: day 0 platelet concentrates were inoculated with low levels of one of seven bacterial strains and stored with agitation at 20 to 24 degrees c for up to 5 days. in the morning  and afternoon of each day of storage, bacterial levels were ascertained by quantitative plate culture, and platelet concentrates were tested for platelet ph, plasma glucose, and swirling. quantitative and semiquantitative dipstick techniques were used to determine ph and glucose levels. results: platelet concentrates had attained stationary phase growth of streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus mitis, or staphylococcus epidermidis (> or = 10(7) -10(8) colony-forming units [cfu]/ml) before either the swirling or dipstick methods suggested the presence of bacteria. the sensitivity of swirling and glucose tests for detecting bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates was generally comparable. although the sensitivity of the ph test was generally similar to that of swirling and glucose tests for most bacteria, platelet concentrates contaminated with e. cloacae had normal ph despite the presence of high levels of bacteria (> or = 10(7)-10(8) cfu/ml). conclusion: the sensitivity in detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates by the swirling technique or by measuring extracellular ph or plasma glucose is less than the sensitivity reported for microscopy with gram stain (10(5)-10(6) cfu/ml), fluorescence microscopy with acridine orange stain (10(4)-10(5) cfu/ml), chemiluminescence detection of ribosomal rna (10(3)-10(4) cfu/ml), and automated bacterial culture (1 cfu/sample volume).

TI  == cloning and characterization of a locus encoding an indolepyruvate decarboxylase  involved in indole-3-acetic acid synthesis in erwinia herbicola.
AB  == erwinia herbicola 299r synthesizes indole-3-acetic acid (iaa) primarily by the indole-3-pyruvic acid pathway. a gene involved in the biosynthesis of iaa was cloned from strain 299r. this gene (ipdc) conferred the synthesis of indole-3-acetaldehyde and tryptophol upon escherichia coli dh5 alpha in cultures  supplemented with l-tryptophan. the deduced amino acid sequence of the gene product has high similarity to that of the indolepyruvate decarboxylase of enterobacter cloacae. regions within pyruvate decarboxylases of various fungal and plant species also exhibited considerable homology to portions of this gene.  this gene therefore presumably encodes an indolepyruvate decarboxylase (ipdc) which catalyzes the conversion of indole-3-pyruvic acid to indole-3-acetaldehyde. insertions of tn3-spice within ipdc abolished the ability of strain 299r to synthesize indole-3-acetaldehyde and tryptophol and reduced its iaa production in tryptophan-supplemented minimal medium by approximately 10-fold, thus providing genetic evidence for the role of the indolepyruvate pathway in iaa synthesis in this strain. an ipdc probe hybridized strongly with the genomic dna of all e. herbicola strains tested in southern hybridization studies, suggesting that the indolepyruvate pathway is common in this species. maximum parsimony analysis revealed that the ipdc gene is highly conserved within this group and that strains of diverse geographic origin were very similar with respect to ipdc.

TI  == [antibiotic sensitivity of aerobic gram-negative bacilli isolated from severe infections in 1992: results of a french multicenter study. groupe d'etude d'infections a bacilles a gram negatif (geign)].
AB  == objectives: antibiotic susceptibility of 649 gram-negative bacilli involved in severe infections and isolated in 18 teaching hospitals from january to december  1992 was evaluated. methods: minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by agar dilution method for piperacillin, piperacillin+ tazobactam and imipenem, and by a microdilution method for 11 other antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, ticarcillin, ciprofloxacin,  fosfomycin, tobramycin, gentamicin, amikacin). criteria of comite francais de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiologie were followed for interpretation. betalactamases were identified by isoelectric focusing and overproduction of cephalosporinase was defined by the resistance phenotype. the main species isolated were escherichia coli (45%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (14%),  klebsiella pneumoniae (7.8%), salmonella spp. (7.5%), enterobacter cloacae (4%) and klebsiella oxytoca (4%). most of the strains were isolated from blood culture (72.3%), respiratory tract (11.4%) and intraabdominal infections (8.6%). most of  the enterobacteria isolates were susceptible to imipenem, aztreonam, amikacin and ciprofloxacin (percentages of susceptibility were respectively 99.3, 98, 98.3 and 96.3); in most of cases clavulanic acid did not entirely restore sensitivity to amoxicillin of penicillinase-producing strains. among 89 p. aeruginosa strains, 82% were susceptible to imipenem and ceftazidime, 81% to the association piperacillin + tazobactam and 51% to ticarcillin. resistance rates are very high  for acinetobacter baumannii except for imipenem. conclusion: production of tem-type penicillinase and over-production of the chromosomal cephalosporinase are the most widely observed mechanisms of resistance (respectively 22% and 9% of 649 strains). prevalence of extended spectrum betalactamases was low (1%) and essentially observed for k. pneumoniae.

AB  == using a chromatographic method for the isolation and detection of periplasmic and cytoplasmic muropeptides avoiding radioactive labeling, we found that in the ampd-negative strain jrg582 the anhydromuropeptide n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-glutamylmesodiaminopimelic acid (anhmurnac tripeptide) accumulates not only in the cytoplasm but also in the periplasm. simultaneously jrg582 carrying the enterobacter cloacae genes ampc and ampr, which are necessary for the induction of beta-lactamase expression, overproduces beta-lactamase. we confirmed that the transmembrane protein ampg transports a precursor muropeptide  into the cytoplasm and that the formation of the anhmurnac tripeptide takes place in the cytoplasm. anhmurnac tripeptide can then be secreted into the periplasm. therefore, the amount of anhmurnac tripeptide in the cytoplasm is reduced not only by ampd but also by transport out of the cell.

AB  == a chromosomal gene of enterobacter cloacae affecting the synthesis of major outer membrane proteins in e. cloacae and escherichia coli was cloned by using selection for resistance to cefoxitin in e. coli. the presence of the gene, when  plasmid-borne, led to a decrease in the amount of porin f in e. cloacae and the amount of ompf in e. coli and caused 2- to 32-fold increases in the mics of chloramphenicol, tetracycline, quinolones, and beta-lactam antibiotics. the gene  encoded a 33-kda protein, similar (83% identity) to the protein rob involved in the initiation of dna replication in e. coli, which was called roba(ec1) by analogy. roba from e. cloacae was found to inhibit ompf expression at the posttranscriptional level via activation of micf, a gene also apparently present  in e. cloacae, as detected by pcr. as with its homolog from e. coli, roba(ec1) is related to the xyls-arac class of positive transcriptional regulators, along with mara and soxs, which also cause a micf-mediated decrease in the level of ampf expression.

AB  == scarce information is available on the real mechanism by which carbapenemes penetrate in enterobacteriaceae, although a considerable amount of evidence suggests that in many species of this family the lack of certain outer membrane proteins is associated with the acquisition of resistance to these antibiotics. the existance of specific pathways for the carbapenems has never been demonstrated, although at times it has been postulated in both wild and mutant strains, on the basis of evident discordances between permeability patterns and suceptibility data. by using the zimmerman and rosselet technique, which requires the strain under investigation to harbor a suitable beta-lactamase, the permeability of intact escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae cells to meropenem and imipenem was investigated by transferring a constructed vector carrying the carbapenem hydrolyzing cpha metallo-beta-lactamase gene into the parental strains and their porin-deficient mutants. reduced amounts of nonspecific porins significantly reduced the penetration of both carbapenems. the virtual absence of porins caused the mics of meropenem to increase, mostly in enterobacter cloacae, while it did not affected the mics of imipenem. no evidence of specific porin pathways of the type described in pseudomonas aeruginosa was found.

TI  == [determination of serum aminoglycoside and vancomycin concentrations by the microbiological method in the presence of other antimicrobials].
AB  == the determination of serum concentrations of antimicrobials with a narrow therapeutic range by microbiological method requires some modifications when the  patient is under combined antimicrobial therapy. the methodological conditions for the appraisal of aminoglycosides and vancomycin in the presence of other drugs were evaluated by using strains with selective sensitivity to the antimicrobial to be tested or by the adding crude extracts of beta-lactamases for the inactivation of the beta-lactam antimicrobials. these beta-lactamases were obtained from enterobacter cloacae p99 (derepressed mutant) cultures for the inactivation of penicillins and first, second and third generation cephalosporins, as well as from stenotrophomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia m 1484 cultures for the hydrolysis of imipenem. the strains allowing vancomycin appraisal and indifferent to the synergic activity of other drugs in the mixture  were s. aureus m 2120, when the accompanying antimicrobials were gentamicin, ciprofloxacin or rifampicin, and e. faecalis m 2113, e. avium m 2091 and s. aureus m 2101 when the drugs in the mixture were amikacin, lincomycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, respectively. for the appraisal of gentamicin in the presence of vancomycin or fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin or norfloxacin), e. coli m 1376 was the most suitable strain, while the use of k. pneumoniae atcc 10031 was required for the appraisal of amikacin or netilmicin. when rifampicin was the accompanying antimicrobial, e. coli m 1495 turned out more adequate. e. coli m 1462 proved to be more satisfactory for gentamicin, amikacin and netilmicin dosages in samples also containing chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or tetracycline.

AB  == the adherence of 12 oral isolates and 4 type strains of enterobacteriaceae (equally representing enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli and citrobacter freundii) to hela cell monolayers following five different incubation conditions (sucrose, d-mannose, serum, mem and candida albicans gdh 1957) was investigated. incubation with sucrose and d-mannose resulted in the greatest and least adherence, respectively. the presence of preadherent c. albicans gdh 1957 on the hela cells tended to enhance the adherence of certain strains of e. cloacae and c. freundii, but had no overall impact on enterobacteriaceae adherence. while heterogeneity of behaviour existed between strains within species, e. cloacae was the most, and k. pneumoniae the least, adherent species irrespective of incubation conditions. haemagglutination assays  indicated the presence of mannose-resistant type 1 fimbriae associated with all enterobacteriaceae. in clinical terms, the variations in adherence properties observed in vitro may contribute to an understanding of the different prevalence  rates of oral enterobacteriaceae reported in the literature.

TI  == a simple gel electrophoretic method for analyzing the muropeptide composition of  bacterial peptidoglycan.
AB  == the muropeptide composition of bacterial peptidoglycan is currently most efficiently determined by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (hplc). though sensitive, the hplc procedure is technically demanding and has been applied to a relatively small number of bacterial strains and species. we have found that fluorescence-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (face) is a simple, rapid method by which reducing muropeptides from multiple peptidoglycan samples can be visualized. individual reducing muropeptides were covalently labeled with the fluorescent molecule 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid,  after which they were separated by electrophoresis through a 35% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by exposure to uv light. face detected the appropriate numbers of reducing muropeptides in the proper proportions for four bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, and yersinia enterocolitica.  as little as 2 to 5 pmol per muropeptide was detected when the intensity of the fluorescent signal was measured with a charge-coupled device camera, at a level of sensitivity between 50 and 250 times higher than that of the classic hplc technique. thus, face may be used to identify interesting peptidoglycan samples prior to more-extensive analysis by hplc, or face may eventually replace hplc for some applications.

AB  == last years, il became obvious that the colonization pattern described in 1976-1978 was no more valid: early colonization by enterobacteriaceae at the 2-3  rd day of life in all newborns, with constant presence of antibioresistant strainseven in non treated newborns. to establish the new pattern of colonization, the same quantitative method of dilution and culture on selective media was used daily from day 1 to day 7 (5 days only for m). the number of enterobacteriaceae, enterococci and staphylococci was determined in the stools of 10 newborns in the maternity unit (= m) (term 40 weeks +/- 1, birth weight 3,356  g +/- 383), 10 in the premature nursery (= p) (term 34.9 weeks +/- 1, birth weight 2,457 g +/- 676), and 14 in the neonatal intensive care unit (= r) (term 35.2 weeks +/- 3.8, birth weight 2,457 g +/- 763). the results establish that colonization by enterobacteriaceae is no more constant at d3. it could be demonstrated only in 8/10 m, 1/10 p, and 6/14 r (statistically different - p < 0.01 - between m and p). at d5, 9/10 m, 5/10 p, 10/14 r, and at d7, 6/10 p and 10/14 r were colonized. resistant enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae) could be found in only 3/10 m, 4/10  p and 6/14 r. enterococci could be found in 1 newborn m, 2 p and 7 newborns r. staphylococci appeared earlier: all newborns m, p and r were colonized at d2, 4 and 5 respectively. these bacteria were coagulase negative, associated with staphylococcus aureus in 3 p. our hypothesis is that late colonization with enterobacteriaceae and enterococci is due to the improvement of hygiene procedures and due to the decontaminating effect of antibiotics in other treated  newborns (enterobacteriaceae by 3 rd generation cephalosporin and enterococci by  pharyngeal vancomycin).

TI  == the role of residues glutamate-50 and phenylalanine-496 in zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase.
AB  == several enzymes require thiamine diphosphate (thdp) as an essential cofactor, and we have used one of these, pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc; ec 4.1.1.1) from zymomonas mobilis, as a model for this group of enzymes. it is well suited for this purpose because of its stability, ease of purification, homotetrameric subunit structure and simple kinetic properties. crystallographic analyses of three thdp-dependent enzymes [muller, lindqvist, furey, schulz, jordan and schneider (1993) structure 1, 95-103] have suggested that an invariant glutamate  participates in catalysis. in order to evaluate the role of this residue, identified in pdc from zymomonas mobilis as glu-50, it has been altered to glutamine and aspartate by site-directed mutagenesis of the cloned gene. the mutant proteins were expressed in escherichia coli. here we demonstrate that substitution with aspartate yields an enzyme with 3% of the activity of the wild-type, but with normal kinetics for pyruvate. replacement of glu-50 with glutamine yields an enzyme with only 0.5% of the catalytic activity of the wild-type enzyme. each of these mutant enzymes has a decreased affinity for both  thdp and mg2+. it has been reported that the binding of cofactors to apopdc quenches the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence [diefenbach and duggleby (1991) biochem. j. 276, 439-445] and we have identified the residue responsible as trp-487 [diefenbach, candy, mattick and duggleby (1992) febs lett. 296, 95-98]. although this residue is some distance from the cofactor binding site, it lies in the dimer interface, and the proposal has been put forward [dyda, furey, swaminathan, sax, farrenkopf and jordan (1993) biochemistry 32, 6165-6170] that alteration of ring stacking with phe-496 of the adjacent subunit is the mechanism of fluorescence quenching when cofactors bind. the closely related enzyme indolepyruvate decarboxylase (from enterobacter cloacae) has a leucine residue at the position corresponding to phe-496 but shows fluorescence quenching properties that are similar to those of pdc. this suggests that the fluorescence quenching is due to some perturbation of the local environment of trp-487 rather than to a  specific interaction with phe-496. this latter hypothesis is supported by our data: mutation of this phenylalanine to leucine, isoleucine or histidine in pdc does not eliminate the fluorescence quenching upon addition of cofactors.

TI  == characterization of a cys115 to asp substitution in the escherichia coli cell wall biosynthetic enzyme udp-glcnac enolpyruvyl transferase (mura) that confers resistance to inactivation by the antibiotic fosfomycin.
AB  == the antibiotic fosfomycin inhibits bacterial cell wall biosynthesis by inactivation of udp-glcnac enolpyruvyl tranferase (mura). prior work has established that cys115 of escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae mura is the  active site nucleophile alkylated by fosfomycin and implicated this residue in the formation of a covalent phospholactyl-enzyme adduct derived from substrate, phosphoenolpyruvate (pep). on the basis of sequencing information from putative mura homolog from mycobacterium tuberculosis, we generated a c115d mutant of e. coli mura that was highly active but fully resistant to time-dependent inhibition by fosfomycin. fosfomycin still bound to the active site of c115d mura, as established by the observed reversible competitive inhibition by fosfomycin. fosfomycin still bound to the active site of c115d mura, as established by the observed reversible competitive inhibition vs pep. in contrast to the broad ph-independent behavior of wild-type (wt) mura, c115d mutant activity titrated across the ph range examined (ph 5.5-9) with an apparent pka approximately 6, with kcatc115d ranging from approximately 10kcatwt at ph 5.5 to <0.1kcatwt at ph9.0. km(pep)115d was relatively constant in the ph range examined and increased approximately 100-fold relative to km(pep)wt. a fosfomycin-resistant c115e mutant with -1% activity of the c115d mutant was found to follow a ph dependence similar to that observed for c115d mura. the contrasting ph dependences of wt and c115d mura was also observed in the reaction with the pseudosubstrate, (z)-3-fluorophosphoenolpyruvate, strongly suggesting a role for cys/asp115 as the general acid in the protonation of c-3 of pep during mura-catalyzed enol ether transfer. the difference in nucleophilicity between the carboxylate side chains of asp115 and glu115 and the thiolate group of cys115 suggests that covalent enzyme adduct formation is not required for catalytic turnover and, furthermore,  provides a chemical rationale for the resistance of the c115d and c115e mutants to fosfomycin inactivation.

AB  == in this multicenter study conducted in eight european countries, 13,173 pathogens--all isolated from community-acquired infections in 1992 and 1993--were evaluated for their susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin g, ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. ten centers in italy, five in germany, in the netherlands and switzerland, four in greece and spain, three in hungary and one in finland contributed to this study; ready-to-use standardized microtiter panels (sceptor system, bbl, heidelberg, germany) were used throughout all assays. the most frequently encountered species were: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and non-typhoid salmonella spp., enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus agalactiae, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter freundii, staphylococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, proteus  vulgaris, moraxella catarrhalis and shigella spp. the percentage of susceptible isolates was assessed for each of the above-mentioned countries and european-wide with all the data available. for many species, the percentage of resistant isolates did not differ markedly between the countries considered. however, one of the most striking exceptions was the high prevalence of high-level penicillin-g-resistant s. pneumoniae isolates in hungary and spain; some of the low-level penicillin-g-resistant strains remained susceptible to cefuroxime, whereas complete cross-resistance occurred for all other beta-lactams studied. the high frequency of ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae isolates in spain deserves mentioning; this could be attributed mainly to the prevalence of a beta-lactamase, as the addition of clavulanic acid rendered these strains susceptible to ampicillin. the penicillin compounds exhibited the greatest activity against gram-positive pathogens, whereas cefetamet was the most active agent against gram-negative pathogens with a well-balanced spectrum of activity.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance and prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase among clinical isolates of gram-negative bacteria in riyadh.
AB  == the activity of ciprofloxacin, imipenem and 12 other commonly used antibiotics was evaluated against 106 documented clinical isolates from a medical intensive care unit (icu). the resistance rates to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, aztreonam and ceftazidime were 42, 25, 24 and 21%, respectively. apart from pseudomonas aeruginosa, all isolates were sensitive to ciprofloxacin and imipenem. complete cross resistance among tested beta-lactam groups was uniformly evident in enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and p. aeruginosa. on the other hand,  penicillins and second generation cephalosporins showed cross resistance among escherichia coli and klebseilla pneumoniae isolates. induction experiments indicate that 70 and 62% of p. aeruginosa and e. cloacae or c. freundii produce class i cephalosporinase, respectively. among all tested isolates, plasmid mediated extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) was detected in one isolate of k. pneumoniae. the plasmid mediated beta-lactamase is transferable and inhibited  by beta-lactamase inhibitors. the transconjugates not only expressed resistance to extended spectrum beta-lactams and aztreonam but also toward tested aminoglycoside antibiotics, with the exception of gentamicin. the obtained transconjugates conferred high level resistance to ceftazidime and aztreonam but  considerably low resistance to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. the isoelectric point  for the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase is 8.2.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial properties of t-5575 and t-5578 novel parenteral 2-carboxypenams.
AB  == t-5575 and t-5578, novel 2-carboxypenams in which a carboxyl group has been introduced into the c-2 beta position of the nucleus, were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial properties. the spectrum of activity of t-5575 was similar to that of aztreonam. however, it showed stronger activities than those of aztreonam against most gram-negative bacteria. t-5575 also showed potent activities against isolates of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to ceftazidime, with mics at which 90% of the isolates were  inhibited of 0.39, 0.39, and 3.13 microgram/ml, respectively. t-5578 showed moderate levels of activity against gram-negative bacteria, compared with those of t-5575. its activity against p. aeruginosa, however, was superior to those of  t-5575 and the reference drugs tested. the most characteristic feature of t-5578  was its potent activities against ceftazidime-, imipenem-, and gentamicin-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates, with mics at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited at 0.39, 3.13, and 3.13 microgram/ml, respectively. these two compounds were unfortunately poorly active against gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus and streptococci. both compounds were found to be stable for hydrolysis by various kinds of beta-lactamases and to have low affinities for these enzymes, with ki values of > 100 microm. these novel penams  bound most tightly to penicillin-binding protein 3 of escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa. these results indicate that t-5575 and t-5578 can be regarded as promising 2-carboxypenams specially targeted against gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == isolation and sequence analysis of rpoh genes encoding sigma 32 homologs from gram negative bacteria: conserved mrna and protein segments for heat shock regulation.
AB  == the rpoh genes encoding homologs of escherichia coli sigma 32 (heat shock sigma factor) were isolated and sequenced from five gram negative proteobacteria (gamma or alpha subgroup): enterobacter cloacae (gamma), serratia marcescens (gamma), proteus mirabilis (gamma), agrobacterium tumefaciens (alpha) and zymomonas mobilis (alpha). comparison of these and three known genes from e.coli (gamma), citrobacter freundii (gamma) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (gamma) revealed marked similarities that should reflect conserved function and regulation of sigma 32 in the heat shock response. both the sequence complementary to part of 16s rrna (the 'downstream box') and a predicted mrna secondary structure similar to those involved in translational control of sigma 32 in e.coli were found for the rpoh genes from the gamma, but not the alpha, subgroup, despite considerable divergence in nucleotide sequence. moreover, a stretch of nine amino acid residues q(r/k)(k/r)lffnlr, designated the 'rpoh box', was absolutely conserved among all sigma 32 homologs, but absent in other sigma factors; this sequence overlapped with the segment of polypeptide thought to be involved in dnak/dnaj chaperone-mediated negative control of synthesis and stability of sigma 32. in addition, a putative sigma e (sigma 24)-specific promoter was found in front of all rpoh genes from the gamma, but not alpha, subgroup. these results suggest that the regulatory mechanisms, as well as the function, of the heat shock response known in e.coli are very well conserved among the gamma subgroup and partially conserved among the alpha proteobacteria.

TI  == [pathogenic bacteria isolated from the sputum of the patients with pulmonary emphysema].
AB  == isolated pathogenic bacteria from sputum of the patients with pulmonary emphysema who were admitted in our hospital from 1984 to 1994 were examined to elucidate the relationship between isolated bacteria from sputum and pulmonary functions including vital capacity (vc), forced expiratory volume (fev1.0), pao2 and paco2. vc of the patients from whom mssa (methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus) or enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis) were isolated was significantly lower than that of the patients from whom streptococcus pneumoniae (s. pneumoniae), branhamella catarrhalis (b. catarrhalis) or haemophilus influenza (h. influenza)  were isolated. fev1.0 had a similar tendency as vc in terms of isolated organisms from the patients with emphysema. similarly, po2 of the patients from whom mssa or e. cloacae were isolated was significantly lower than that of the patients from whom s. pneumoniae, b. catarrhalis or h. influenzae were isolated, and pco2  of the patients from whom s. pneumoniae, b. catarrhalis or h. influenza were isolated. there was also impaired respiratory function in the patients from whom  mssa, escherichia coli (e. coli), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), xanthomonas maltophilia (x. maltophilia) or enterobacter cloacae (e. cloacae) were isolated, compared with those in the patients from whom s. pneumonia, b. catarrhalis or h. influenzae were isolated. these results suggest that isolated pathogenic bacteria are shifted from s. pneumoniae, b. catarrhalis or h. influenza to mssa, e. coli, p. aeruginosa, x. maltophilia or e. cloacae in the course of impairment of respiratory function in pulmonary emphysema. the treatment and prophylaxis for acute exacerbation in pulmonary emphysema should be based on these results.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefpirome against selected clinical enterobacterial isolates with beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.
AB  == previous studies have shown that there is a high incidence of resistance to cephalosporins among enterobacteria isolated in greek hospitals. this resistance  is mainly due to either the derepression of chromosomal cephalosporinases or the  acquisition of plasmids coding for shv-5 type beta-lactamase. in the present study the activity of cefpirome against a number of enterobacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and serratia marcescens) possessing the mechanisms mentioned above was examined. cefpirome was found active against all the strains characterized by stable derepression of chromosomal class-c enzymes. the antibiotic was less potent against strains expressing shv-5 type beta-lactamase due to its hydrolysis by the enzyme. also cefpirome exhibited good activity against e. aerogenes strains with  reduced susceptibility to imipenem. these in vitro data suggest that cefpirome might be useful in treating infections caused by these resistant microorganisms that are frequently encountered in greek hospitals.

TI  == nosocomial bacteremia-induced increases in abscess formation correlate with in vitro upregulation of macrophage procoagulant activity.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the hypothesis that sublethal exposure to common nosocomial pathogens can alter the host response to a later, distant infectious insult (peritonitis and intraperitoneal abscess formation), and that these changes are related to the induction of macrophage procoagulant activity. design: a multiexperiment, randomized, controlled trial. setting: animal research laboratory of a university medical center. subjects: one hundred sixty-five balb/c mice, weighing 20 to 25 g, were used for in vivo experiments and as the source of peritoneal macrophages for in vitro experiments. interventions: nine groups of mice (n = 10 to 18 per group) were twice systemically preexposed to sublethal amounts of live escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, or candida albicans, or to 2.5 or 5.0 micrograms e. coli lipopolysaccharide o26:b6. one week later, mice underwent the induction of mixed e. coli/bacteroides fragilis peritonitis, leading to abscess formation. in parallel experiments in vitro, 10(6) mouse peritoneal macrophages were incubated with similar amounts of nosocomial pathogens or lipopolysaccharide to determine the induction of macrophage procoagulant activity. measurements and main results: the three gram-negative bacilli tested significantly upregulated both abscess formation and macrophage procoagulant activity, with a strong linear correlation between abscess formation and procoagulant activity. these effects were not seen with the gram-positive cocci or with c. albicans. pre-exposure of mice to endotoxin alone  did not alter later abscess formation, but did increase macrophage procoagulant activity. conclusions: sublethal exposure to some gram-negative nosocomial pathogens can significantly alter a host's response to a later, distant, infection, even when caused by different bacteria. in the case of peritonitis and intraperitoneal abscess formation, these changes may be mediated by the upregulation of macrophage procoagulant activity. the presence of endotoxin alone does not completely explain these phenomena.

TI  == antibiotic-induced endotoxin release in patients with gram-negative urosepsis: a  double-blind study comparing imipenem and ceftazidime.
AB  == the clinical significance of differences between antibiotics in endotoxin-liberating potential is unknown. thirty patients with gram-negative urosepsis were randomized between imipenem and ceftazidime, which have, respectively, a low and a high endotoxin-liberating potential in vitro. in patients treated with ceftazidime, a slower defervescence was noticed. after 4 h  of treatment, the blood endotoxin level decreased in all 3 endotoxemic patients receiving imipenem, whereas it increased in 2 of the 4 endotoxemic patients receiving ceftazidime, and in ceftazidime-treated patients, the endotoxin level in urine decreased less than in imipenem-treated subjects. serum and urine cytokine levels increased 10%-40% after 4 h of ceftazidime treatment compared with no increase in the imipenem-treated patients (p > .05). endotoxin release during antibiotic killing in vitro, assessed for all microorganisms, was 10-fold  higher with ceftazidime (p < .001). these results indicate that differences between antibiotics in endotoxin release may affect the inflammatory response during treatment.

AB  == the frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 1,032 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of june 1989 to may 1990. of the above total bacterial isolates, gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.8% and a  majority of them were enterococcus faecalis. gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.2% and most of them were escherichia coli. 1. enterococcus faecalis imipenem (ipm) showed the highest activity against e. faecalis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. the followings, ampicillin (abpc) and vancomycin (vcm)  showed potent activities, with the mic90s of 2 micrograms/ml. piperacillin (pipc), minocycline (mino) and chloramphenicol (cp) were also active with the mic90s of 8 micrograms/ml. the others were not so active with the mic90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 2. staphylococcus aureus vcm showed the highest activity  against s. aureus with mic90 of 1 microgram/ml. dicloxacillin (mdipc) and arbekacin (abk) were active with the mic90s of 2 micrograms/ml. mino showed the mic90 of 4 micrograms/ml. all other agents except ciprofloxacin (cpfx) showed lower activity. 3. staphylococcus epidermidis mino showed the highest activity against s. epidermidis. its mic90 was 0.25 microgram/ml. the followings, abk and  vcm were also active with the mic90s of 0.5 microgram/ml, 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the others except cpfx were not so active. 4. coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) most of the agents were active against cns. ipm, abk and mino showed the highest activities with the mic90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. mdipc, cefazolin (cez), cefotiam (ctm) and vcm were also active with the mic90s of 1 microgram/ml. clindamycin (cldm) showed lower activity, with the mic90 of 128 micrograms/ml. 5. streptococcus agalactiae cez, cefuzonam (czon), ipm and cldm showed the potent activity, all strains were inhibited at the mic of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. the followings, cefmenoxime (cmx) and erythromycin (em) were active with the mic90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. pipc and vcm were also active with the mic90s 0.25 microgram/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively  amikacin (amk) showed lower activity. escherichia coli ipm, ctm, flomoxef (fmox), cmx, carumonam (crmn), norfloxacin (nflx), ofloxacin (oflx) and cpfx showed the highest activities against e. coli. the mic90s of them were .125 microgram/ml or  below. ceftazidime (caz) and czon were also active with the mic90s of 0.25 microgram/ml. penicillins except mecillinam (mpc) were not so active showing the  mic90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 7. klebsiella pneuminiae fmox, cmx, cefixime (cfix), ipm, crmn and nflx showed the highest activities against k. pneumoniae.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == typing of sequential bacterial isolates by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
AB  == we typed 39 sets of multiple bacterial isolates of the same species from patients by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of genomic dna (pfge). isolates were cultured from different sites or over a 2-week or longer interval. staphylococcus aureus,  enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae were tested. excluding e. cloacae, 28 of 32  sets of isolates (87%) demonstrated only identical or highly related pfge types.  four of the seven sets of e. cloacae showed different types. for species other than e. cloacae, our results suggest that patients are usually colonized and infected with a single strain of these bacterial pathogens. unlike all of the other tested species, e. cloacae pfge typing differences suggested the presence of multiple strains causing colonization and infection.

TI  == inhibitory action of metabolites of pseudomonas aeruginosa against gram-negative  bacteria.
AB  == fifty clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested for inhibition of growth of clinical isolates of escherichia coli, salmonella infantis, klebsiella  pneumoniae and other gram-negative bacteria in the authors' laboratory. pseudomonas aeruginosa was strongly active against both e. coli and enterobacter  cloacae, with 89.4% and 94.7% inhibition respectively, but weakly active against  s. infantis, k. pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis with 56.3%, 48.8% and 23.8% inhibition, respectively. the pigmented strains were found to have stronger antimicrobial activity than the unpigmented strains. pyocyanin, the major metabolite of pseudomonas aeruginosa, has been shown to inhibit escherichia coli, proteus spp. and other gram-negative bacteria, by research with a few strains of  p. aeruginosa and a single inhibited strain. however, little attempt has been made to determine the inhibitory action of many strains of p. aeruginosa against  a large number of clinical isolates such as escherichia spp., klebsiella spp., and salmonella spp., up to now. for this reason, in this study we examined 50 randomly selected clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa for inhibition of growth of  a wide range of gram-negative bacteria, including 30 strains of e. coli, 30 of k. pneumoniae, 30 of s. infantis, 6 of enterobacter cloacae and 9 of proteus mirabilis.

TI  == multidrug resistance in klebsiella pneumoniae: a novel gene, rama, confers a multidrug resistance phenotype in escherichia coli.
AB  == spontaneous multidrug-resistant (mdr) mutants of klebsiella pneumoniae strain ecl8 arose at a frequency of 2.2 x 10(-8) and showed increased resistance to a range of unrelated antibiotics, including chloramphenicol, tetracycline, nalidixic acid, ampicillin, norfloxacin, trimethoprim and puromycin. a chromosomal fragment from one such mutant was cloned, and found to confer an mdr  phenotype on escherichia coli k12 cells that was essentially identical to that of the k. pneumoniae mutant. almost complete loss of the ompf porin in the e. coli transformant, and of the corresponding porin in the k. pneumoniae mutant, was observed. the presence of the mdr mutation in k. pneumoniae or the cloned k. pneumoniae rama (resistance antibiotic multiple) locus in e. coli also resulted in active efflux of tetracycline, and increased active efflux of chloramphenicol. after transformation of a rama plasmid into e. coli, expression of chloramphenicol resistance occurred later than expression of resistance to tetracycline, puromycin, trimethoprim and nalidixic acid. the rama gene was localized and sequenced. it encodes a putative positive transcriptional activator that is weakly related to the e. coli mara and soxs proteins. a rama gene was also found to be present in an enterobacter cloacae fragment that has previously  been shown to confer an mdr phenotype, and it appears that rama, rather than the  roma gene identified in that study, is responsible for multidrug resistance. the  rama gene from the wild-type k. pneumoniae was identical to that of the mutant strain and also conferred an mdr phenotype on e. coli, indicating that the mutation responsible for mdr in k. pneumoniae had not been cloned.

TI  == effects of mutations and deletions on expression of the enterobacter cloacae ompx gene.
AB  == the enterobacter cloacae outer membrane protein ompx is involved in resistance to beta-lactams, and possesses virulence characteristics. to gain more insight into  the genetic elements that are important for ompx expression, several mutations were introduced at, and immediately upstream of, the n-terminus of the ompx coding sequence. these mutations enabled us to delete the 5' untranslated region  and the signal peptide coding sequence. the former led to decreased ompx expression, indicating an unexpected and hitherto unexplained role for this region. deletion of the signal peptide coding sequence blocked transport across the cytoplasmic membrane, indicating that translocation of ompx across the cytoplasmic membrane is mediated by the general secretory pathway.

TI  == ceftibuten: a review of antimicrobial activity, spectrum and other microbiologic  features.
AB  == ceftibuten is a new, orally administered cephalosporin with exceptional beta-lactamase stability and potency against commonly isolated gram-negative pathogens. more than 90% of recent enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates were inhibited by < or = 8 micrograms/ml of ceftibuten. in only five enteric species (citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, morganella morganii, serratia marcescens) were more than 15% of strains resistant (minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic, with percent of strains inhibited in subscript numbers) > 16 micrograms/ml) to ceftibuten. enteritis-producing bacteria such as  salmonella, shigella, escherichia coli and yersinia were very ceftibuten-susceptible (mic50 < or = 0.13 microgram/ml). fastidious gram-negative species causing respiratory tract or genital infections had very low ceftibuten mics, including beta-lactamase-positive haemophilus influenzae (mic90 0.06 to 2 micrograms/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic90 0.25 to 4 micrograms/ml), and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mic90 0.015 to 0.5 microgram/ml). beta-hemolytic streptococci and penicillin-susceptible pneumococci were also inhibited by ceftibuten. staphylococci, enterococci, pseudomonas species and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria were generally resistant to ceftibuten. ceftibuten has demonstrated bactericidal activity against susceptible pathogens, has high affinity for several lethal penicillin-binding proteins and possesses stability to common plasmid- or chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases, including those enzymes that hydrolyze parenteral third generation cephalosporins. the microbiologic features for ceftibuten indicate its clinical potential as chemotherapy for community-acquired respiratory tract infections.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activities of fk037: a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  == the antibacterial and bactericidal activities and the stability of fk037 to beta-lactamases were investigated and compared with those of cefpirome, flomoxef, ceftazidime, ceftizoxime, and vancomycin. against clinical isolates of methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, fk037 was  less active than vancomycin but more potent than the other drugs tested. among highly methicillin-resistant staphylococci (mic for methicillin: 200 mg/l or higher), none of the strains were highly resistant to fk037 (mic > or = 100 mg/l) unlike the other cephalosporins. with the exception of enterococcus faecalis, fk037 had an activity equipotent to that of cefpirome and far superior to those of flomoxef, ceftazidime and ceftizoxime against other gram-positive clinical isolates. the activity of fk037 against pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas cepacia was equipotent to that of cefpirome but 2- to 4-fold less active than that of ceftazidime. fk037 inhibited 90% of enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter  freundii growth at a concentration of 6.25 mg/l; it was as active as cefpirome and much more active than ceftazidime. against the other gram-negative bacteria tested, fk037 was equipotent to cefpirome and ceftazidime and was more effective  than flomoxef. fk037, like cefpirome, portrayed a high stability to various beta-lactamases except type ii penicillinase and oxyimino-cephalosporinase (cxase). fk037 scored an mic range of 0.013-6.25 mg/l against numerous beta-lactamase-producing bacterial strains with the exception of some cxase-producing strains and a cephalosporinase-producing c. freundii; and against strains other than p. aeruginosa fk037 was as active as cefpirome and 2- to 32-fold more active than ceftazidime. fk037 displayed highly potent activities against cephalosporinase-producing e. cloacae, c. freundii and serratia marcescens which were resistant to flomoxef and ceftizoxime. fk037 was highly bactericidal against s. aureus and escherichia coli at its mic or higher.

TI  == biological and immunological comparisons of enterobacter cloacae and escherichia  coli porins.
AB  == bacteriocin susceptibilities indicate that during cloacin df13 uptake the f porin of enterobacter cloacae plays a similar role to that reported for the ompf porin  of escherichia coli during colicin a entry. the translocatory activities of these two porins during the bacteriocin uptake can be substituted by the porins d and ompc, respectively, under conditions not requiring the receptor binding step. using anti-peptide antibodies, a peptide located in the internal loop l3 of the escherichia coli ompf porin was identified in the d and f porins of enterobacter  cloacae. the results demonstrated the existence of a close relationship between porins in terms of both antigenic determinants and bacteriocin susceptibilities.

TI  == emergence and mechanisms of bacterial resistance in surgical infections.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance is commonplace among bacteria involved in surgical infections, including staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and bacteroides species. resistance  traits can be encoded on chromosomes or transmissible plasmids. the basic mechanisms of resistance are alteration of drug target, prevention of drug access to target, and drug inactivation. examples include alteration of penicillin-binding proteins in resistance to penicillinase-resistant penicillins, ribosomal binding site protection in tetracycline resistance, and beta-lactamase  destruction of beta-lactam compounds. resistance due to the many types of beta-lactamases that have thus far been identified is wide-spread among common pathogens; use of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations has proved effective as one means of counteracting such resistance. contending with resistance involves appropriate use of available antimicrobials, development of novel agents or modification of existing agents, and measures to forestall emergence and spread of resistant organisms.

TI  == control-related effective regrowth time and post-antibiotic effect of meropenem on gram-negative bacteria studied by bioluminescence and viable counts.
AB  == a study was performed to compare viable counts and bioluminescence for determining control related effective regrowth time (cert) and postantibiotic effect (pae) on gram-negative bacteria after two hours of exposure to meropenem.  there was a good correlation between bioluminescence and viable counts in determining the cell numbers in growing cultures of escherichia coli. cert was defined as the time required for the resumption of logarithmic growth and an increase of 1 log10 to occur over the pre-exposure inoculum in the test culture minus corresponding time for the control culture. pae and cert were studied on reference strains of enterobacter cloacae, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. at 4 x mic of meropenem the certs of these four gram-negative strains were 4.1, 4.9, 4.2, and 3.6 h, respectively, when assayed by bioluminescence. corresponding certs using viable counts were 4.2, 5.0, 5.1 and 3.8 h, respectively. in contrast to this good agreement between the methods in assessing cert, the corresponding paes were highly method dependent. at 4 x mic of meropenem the paes on e. cloacae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa were 3.9, 4.8, 4.7, and 3.5 h, respectively, when assayed by bioluminescene. however, the corresponding and simultaneously determined viable count paes were -0.4, 0.5, -0.1, and 0.7 h, respectively. the poor correlation between these methods in assessing the pae is caused by greater initial decrease in viability compared with the less prominent initial change in cell density as measured by bioluminescence.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == pharmacodynamic effects of meropenem on gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro initial killing and post-antibiotic effect (pae) of meropenem on five gram-negative reference strains were evaluated by bioluminescence assay of bacterial adenosine triphosphate (atp) and viable count. morphology studies were  performed in parallel. meropenem showed concentration-dependent long (2-5 h) paes on enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens when assayed by bioluminescence and induced spheroplasts at almost all concentrations. the bioluminescence paes reached a maximum response at 4 x mic. these paes of meropenem on escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia marcescens were longer than corresponding paes of imipenem shown in previous studies. the higher affinity of meropenem than imipenem for pbp 3 might explain the longer paes obtained with meropenem. however, there was only a very short pae, no pae or even a negative pae when viable count was used as the initial value for the pae calculation. a strong initial decrease in viability but a less pronounced change in intracellular atp was registered. since this initial change in cell numbers is the initial value for the pae calculation, the length of pae was highly method dependent. in summary, a strong initial killing and no pae were shown using viable count as the initial value for the pae calculation, but a weak initial killing and long paes were shown when bioluminescence was used throughout the experiments.

TI  == cephalosporin derivatives of doxorubicin as prodrugs for activation by monoclonal antibody-beta-lactamase conjugates.
AB  == the synthesis of a series of cephalosporin doxorubicin derivatives that differ with respect to the substituent at position 7 of the cephem nucleus is described. these compounds are designed as prodrugs of doxorubicin for activation by monoclonal antibody-beta-lactamase conjugates. the key step in the synthesis of this series of compounds involves the use of the phenylacetamido group as an enzymatically removable protecting group for the 7-amino group on the cephem. in  vitro cytotoxicity assays with h2981 lung adenocarcinoma cells revealed that cephalosporin doxorubicin derivatives were all less toxic than the released drug. prodrugs containing negatively charged groups in the side chain, such as the delta-carboxybutanamido derivative 4 and the alpha-sulfophenylacetyl derivative 5, displayed the least cytotoxic activity and were 46- and 26-fold less toxic than doxorubicin, respectively. the efficiency of activation of all the prodrugs  was evaluated in cytotoxicity assays on h2981 cells with the beta-lactamases from enterobacter cloacae p99, escherichia coli tem-1, and bacillus cereus (type ii).  in general, the e. cloacae enzyme was found to most rapidly activate the majority of these prodrugs. phenylacetamido prodrug 2 and delta-carboxybutanamido prodrug  4 were both activated in an immunospecific manner by l6-e. cloacae beta-lactamase, a monoclonal antibody conjugate that binds to receptors on h2981  lung adenocarcinoma cells.

TI  == molecular evolution of a class c beta-lactamase extending its substrate specificity.
AB  == enterobacter cloacae gc1, a clinical strain isolated in 1992 in japan, was found  to produce a chromosomal class c beta-lactamase with extended substrate specificity to oxyimino beta-lactam antibiotics, significantly differing from the known e. cloacae beta-lactamases such as the p99 beta-lactamase. the 1560 nucleotides including the gc1 beta-lactamase gene were sequenced, and the amino acid sequence of the mature enzyme comprising 364 amino acids was deduced. a comparison of the amino acid sequence with those of known e. cloacae beta-lactamases revealed the duplication of three amino acids at positions 208-213, i.e. ala-val-arg-ala-val-arg. this duplication was attributed to a tandem duplication of a 9-nucleotide sequence. the chimeric beta-lactamases produced by the chimeric genes from the gc1 and p99 beta-lactamase genes indicated that the extended substrate specificity is entirely attributed to the 3-amino acid insertion. two mutant beta-lactamases were prepared from p99 beta-lactamase by site-directed mutagenesis, i.e. an ala-ala-ala sequence was inserted before or after the native ala-val-arg at positions 208-210. these mutant enzymes revealed that the ala-val-arg located from positions 211 to 213 in the gc1 beta-lactamase are the newly inserted residues, and this phenomenon is independent of the characteristics of the amino acids inserted.

TI  == fimh adhesin of type 1 pili is assembled into a fibrillar tip structure in the enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == type 1 pili are heteropolymeric mannosebinding fibers produced by all members of  the enterobacteriaceae family. the bulk of the fiber is composed of fima. two macromolecular complexes responsible for mediating an interaction with mannose-containing receptors were purified from fima- escherichia coli by mannose affinity chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography. one complex contained only the mannose-binding adhesin, fimh, associated with fimg, a minor component of the type 1 pilus. in the other complex the fimg-fimh moiety was loosely associated with a chaperone-minor subunit complex (fimc-fimf), possibly representing an intermediate in tip fibrilla assembly. the fimc chaperone has also been shown to form a preassembly complex with fimh that has been purified and characterized previously. purified fimc did not bind to the fimg-fimh complex but did recognize fimh dissociated from the fimg-fimh complex. quick-freeze deep-etch electron microscopy revealed that the fimg-fimh complex had a thin fibrillar architecture. high-resolution electron microscopy of type 1 pili revealed that a 16-nm fibrillar tip structure with an architecture identical to that of the fimg-fimh complex was joined end-to-end to the pilus rod. in a fimh-  deletion mutant, the tip fibrillae joined to pilus rods were approximately 3 nm in length. the full-length tip fibrilla was restored by complementation with the  fimh gene in trans. the bipartite nature of the type 1 pilus was also demonstrated on pili purified from clinical isolates of members of the enterobacteriaceae family arguing that it is a conserved feature of the type 1 pilus.

AB  == this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1991. in this study, identifications and susceptibility  testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. the susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by nccls. staphylococcus aureus and cns showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (dmppc). streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to  many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. though enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (abpc), piperacillin (pipc), imipenem (ipm), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st) compounds, enterococcus faecium was resistant  to almost all antibacterial agents but to st compounds. high susceptibility rates were observed for strains of enterobacter cloacae to ipm, gentamicin (gm) and ofloxacin (oflx) and for strains of proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (lmox), ipm, aztreonam (azt), gm and oflx. serratia marcescens and bacteroides fragilis group  were highly susceptible only to ipm. pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (caz), ipm, amikacin (amk) and tobramycin (tob). pseudomonas cepacia  was relatively susceptible only to caz. ipm showed strong antibacterial activity  to many species except for s. aureus and cns.

TI  == identification and characterization of an outer membrane protein, ompx, in escherichia coli that is homologous to a family of outer membrane proteins including ail of yersinia enterocolitica.

AB  == the in vitro activities of the carbapenem bms-181139 were determined in comparison with those of imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin. bms-181139 was the most active against species of pseudomonas and related genera alteromonas and burkholderia, with mics for 147 of 149 isolates of < 4 micrograms/ml. of 22 imipenem-resistant (mic > 8 micrograms/ml) p. aeruginosa strains, only 1 required an mic of bms-181139 of > 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 14 requiring the same meropenem mic. bms-181139 was the most active carbapenem against the majority of other gram-negative species except members of the tribe proteeae, against which meropenem was more active. although imipenem was more active against gram-positive species, bms-18139 mics at which 90% of strain tested were inhibited were < 1 microgram/ml for these species. bms-181139 was generally active against isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin or broad-spectrum cephalosporins, including those containing plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases or high levels of chromosome-encoded beta-lactamases, as well as anaerobes except clostridium difficile. inoculum effects were noted for all three carbapenems against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and serratia marcescens but  not escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or staphylococcus aureus. bms-181139's inoculum effect tended to be more marked. bms-181139 exhibited bactericidal activity at the mic for some strains and up to four to eight times the mic for others. the postantibiotic effect of bms-181139 was equal to or less  than that of imipenem and, like meropenem, exhibited intraspecies variability. bms-181139 was 30-fold more stable than imipenem and 7-fold more stable than meropenem to hydrolysis by hog kidney dehydropeptidase.

AB  == adherence of bacteria to animal cells is considered the first step in the pathogenesis of many infectious diseases. the most suitable techniques developed  in vitro to check the capacity of bacteria to adhere to different tissues use monolayers of established cell lines. we studied the influence of incubation time (1, 2, 3 hours), cell substrates (hep-2, h-407) and the number of bacteria per cell (1, 10, 100, 1000) on the adherence index (number of adherent bacteria per cell determined by microscopic count) of the fimbriated escherichia coli 454 strain, proteus rettgeri 25 and enterobacter cloacae 10. the data were analyzed with different statistical methods and the results evidenced that all the conditions considered affect either the end-point of the test or the adherence index. our observations indicate that the different methods used make it impracticable to compare many data from the literature and suggest the need to search for more homogeneity in this type of assay.

TI  == comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: a multi-center study in five mediterranean countries.
AB  == in 5 mediterranean countries 7902 pathogens, all isolated in 1992 and 1993 from community-acquired infections, were studied for susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin g, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid (both 2:1 ratio), cefalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime,  cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. ten centers in italy, 4 centers in greece, 3 centers in spain, and 1 center in lebanon and saudi arabia contributed  to this study; all centers used performed standardized microtiter panels (sceptor, bbl, heidelberg, frg). the most frequently isolated pathogens were escherichia coli (n = 1267), proteus mirabilis (n = 843), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 771), enteric salmonella spp. (n = 629), enterobacter cloacae (n = 486), citrobacter freundii (n = 383), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 346), haemophilus influenzae (n = 298), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 294), streptococcus pneumoniae  (n = 246), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 243), and shigella spp. (n = 185). statistical analysis was performed for each of the above countries and for all pooled data available. the penicillin antibiotics were the most active compounds against the  gram-positive cocci, exceeding the mic90 values 2- to 8-fold over all cephalosporins. regarding the gram-negatives (above all klebsiella spp.) cefetamet was by far the most active compound (mic90 = 1 mg/l). regarding the percentage of resistant isolates, there were no striking discrepancies between the centers and countries involved in this study. there was, however, complete cross-resistance in penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae isolates (mic90 = 2 mg/l). by far the majority of the penicillin-resistant pneumococci showed additional resistance to doxycycline and erythromycin.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == antimicrobial activity of 11 newer and investigational drugs tested against aerobic isolates from spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
AB  == the in vitro susceptibility of 124 aerobic bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (sbp) were tested against 11 antimicrobial agents, including parenteral or oral cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. most sbp isolates were gram-negative organisms, and escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were responsible for 63% of the episodes evaluated. the fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin) and the "fourth-generation" cephalosporin cefpirome were the most active agents against the gram-negative bacteria. commonly used cefotaxime and cefotaxime-desacetylcefotaxime (des-ctx) combinations were also very active against gram-negative bacteria with only few enterobacter cloacae isolates being  resistant (minimum inhibitory concentrations > 32 micrograms/ml). all streptococci were susceptible to cefotaxime, cefpirome, and cefdaloxime and to the cefotaxime-des-ctx combinations, whereas only ofloxacin demonstrated acceptable activity against the enterococci. the widest spectrum of activity versus sbp isolates was found for ofloxacin (98% susceptibility) among the fluoroquinolones. for the beta-lactams, the widest spectrum of activity was demonstrated by cefpirome and the 2:1 cefotaxime-des-ctx combination (93% susceptibility). these results indicate that the role of ofloxacin and newer parenteral or orally administered cephalosporins in the treatment of prophylaxis  of sbp should be further evaluated.

TI  == role of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor as adjunct therapy for septicemia in children with acute leukemia.
AB  == the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (g-csf) has been shown to accelerate recovery from severe neutropenia and to decrease the incidence of documented infections after intensive chemotherapy in cancer patients. however, the routine  prophylactic use of g-csf is expensive. this study was conducted to determine the role of g-csf as adjunct therapy for septicemia following neutropenia caused by chemotherapy in children with acute leukemia. fifty consecutive episodes of septicemia were studied involving 34 episodes of gram-negative, 7 episodes of gram-positive, 5 episodes of polymicrobial bacterial septicemia, one episode of fungemia, and 3 episodes of disseminated fungal infection. in the first 25 episodes, g-csf was not used (group a). for the next 16 episodes, g-csf 200 micrograms per square meter per day subcutaneously was given immediately after the septicemia was documented until the absolute neutrophil count was maintained  at more than 1,500 per cubic millimeter (group b). thereafter, g-csf at the same  dose as that of group b was prophylactically used in all the children who received high-dose cytosine arabinoside-containing regimens. nine episodes of septicemia occurred (group c). the incidences of mortality per episode of septicemia in groups a, b, and c were 12.0% (3/25), 12.5% (2/16) and 0% (0/9), respectively. statistically, there was no difference between the three groups overall and in pair-wise comparisons (all p > 0.5). the durations of g-csf administration in group b ranged from 6 to 26 days with a median of 12 days and the durations of g-csf administration in group c ranged from 10 to 23 days with a median of 19 days. with or without g-csf, there may be no significant difference  in the mortality of septicemia following neutropenia caused by chemotherapy in children with acute leukemia.

TI  == growth conditions influence expression of cell surface hydrophobicity of staphylococci and other wound infection pathogens.
AB  == the initial adhesion of microbes to tissue and solid surfaces can be mediated by  hydrophobic interaction. expression of microbial cell surface hydrophobicity (csh) is influenced by growth conditions, and often best expressed after growth under nutrient-poor conditions, or "starvation". in the present study, the csh of 133 strains of enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, group a streptococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, peptococcus magnus, and of 8 candida albicans strains was measured by the salt aggregation test after growth on hematin agar in a 5% co2 atmosphere, or under anaerobiosis. cells of all but 8 strains expressed pronounced or moderate csh, i.e., they aggregated in  0.01-2 m ammonium sulfate. when the agar surface was covered by human serum (diluted 1:5) to mimic growth conditions in a wound, 94 strains expressed higher  csh, and 44 strains the same csh as after growth without serum. the csh of 12 strains of different species was measured after growth on blood, hematin and pdm  agar, with or without serum, and in an aerobic or a 5% co2 atmosphere. the highest csh was expressed after growth in 5% co2 with serum, and the lowest growth after on blood agar in aerobic atmosphere. identical results were obtained with native and heat-inactivated (56 c, 20 min) serum. the reduced surface tension obtained in 5% co2, as well as yet unidentified serum factors, promotes expression of csh.

AB  == bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on sy5555 dry syrup (powder which is dissolved before use), a new penem antibiotic for oral use, were performed. the following results were obtained. 1. antibacterial activities. mics of sy5555, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (cva/ampc), cefotiam (ctm), cefpodoxime (cpdx), cefaclor (ccl) and cefdinir (cfdn) were determined against clinically isolated staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae at a dose of 10(6) cfu/ml. mics of sy5555 against s. aureus, cns, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, e. coli and e. cloacae were 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, < or = 0.025, 0.78, 0.2, 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively, showing excellent antibacterial effects on these pathogens. although the effects of sy 5555 against h. influenzae and e. coli were slightly inferior to those of cpdx and cfdn, the drug showed the most excellent antibacterial effect on other strains as compared with the control drugs. 2. absorption and excretion in this study, plasma concentrations and urinary recovery rates were examined after administration of sy5555 at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg (potency) after meals. with both 5 and 10 mg/kg doses, peak plasma concentrations were reached 1 hour after administration, at 0.25-2.61 micrograms/ml (mean 1.47 micrograms/ml) and 1.08-2.17 micrograms/ml (mean 1.74 micrograms/ml), respectively. the plasma levels rapidly decreased to 0.06-0.19 micrograms/ml (0.12 micrograms/ml) and 0.0503-0.0637 micrograms/ml) after 6 hours. the half-lives 1.12 hours in the 5 mg/kg group and 1.0 hour in the 10 mg/kg group. the urinary recovery rates were determined in the first 8 hours after administration in the 5 mg/kg and 6 hours in the 10 mg/kg group, and the values were as low as 1.05-12.3% and 1.6-4.33%, respectively. 3. clinical results the clinical responses were examined in a total of 73 cases including 4 acute pneumonia, 13 acute bronchitis, 11 tonsillitis, 3 pharyngitis, 12 scarlet fever,  2 pertussis, 6 urinary tract infection, 6 otitis media, 7 lymphadenitis, 2 staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, 2 phlegmon, 4 impetigo and 1 purulent parotitis. the treatment was effective or better in 66 of 70 cases with an efficacy rate of 94.3% (3 undeterminable cases were excluded). bacteriological effects were examined during the clinical course for detected or suspected pathogens found before administration of sy5555. the effects were determined in 50 cases including 7 cases of polymicrobacterial infections, 57 strains in total. eight strains, however, persisted, hence the overall eradication rate was 86.0%.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == disinfection of dental stone casts: antimicrobial effects and physical property alterations.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of disinfecting solutions incorporated into dental stone casts against a standard and representative group of microorganisms and to note changes in the physical properties of the casts. methods: irreversible hydrocolloid impressions were contaminated individually with escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, actinobacter calcoaceticus, bacillus subtilis, mycobacterium phlei and candida albicans. four  readily available disinfecting solutions (glutaraldehyde, povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine and sodium hypochlorite) were added to the die stone mix used to pour up the impressions. the set cast surfaces were swabbed at 1 h and 24 h, the  samples plated on agar and incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h and 3 d for m. phlei. subsequently, colony forming units were counted. the physical properties assessed were setting time, setting expansion, compressive strength, detail reproduction and delayed expansion of the stone. results: only glutaraldehyde and povidone-iodine killed all contaminating microorganisms within 1 h, while the 1:5 dilution of sodium hypochlorite solution was equally effective after 24 h. two percent glutaraldehyde was the most effective disinfectant with the least adverse effects on the physical properties of the set cast. although povidone-iodine caused a decrease in the compressive strength of the set cast, it can be considered to be a sound alternative. significance: this study supports the concept of incorporating disinfectants into model stone as a standard operating procedure for impressions of unknown history and, most sensibly, all dental impressions.

AB  == uridine diphosphate-n-acetylglucosamine (udp-nag) enolpyruvyl transferase from enterobacter cloacae catalyzes the transfer of an enolpyruvyl moiety from phosphoenolpyruvate (pep) to the 3-hydroxyl of udp-nag to form enolpyruvyl udp-nag and inorganic phosphate. indirect evidence for the involvement of a covalent intermediate, in which the c-2 of o-phosphothioketal moiety is attached  to cys-115, in the reaction catalyzed by udp-nag enolpyruvyl transferase has been reported by wanke and amrhein [wanke, c., & amrhein, n. (1993) eur. j. biochem. 218, 861-870]. in the enzyme from escherichia coli, a noncovalent tetrahedral intermediate in which the c-2 of pep is attached to the 3-oh of udp-nag via an ether linkage has been isolated by marquardt et al. [marquardt, j.l., brown, e.d., walsh, c.t., & anderson, k.s. (1993) j. am. chem. soc. 115, 10398-10399]. in this study, we provide direct evidence for the formation of a covalent o-phosphothioketal enzyme intermediate from udp-nag enolpyruvyl transferase of e. cloacae overexpressed in e. coli. the intermediate was obtained by incubation of  the enzyme with [2,3-13c2]pep and udp-nag and was characterized by solution-state 1d 13c and 31p nmr, 13c dept nmr, and 1h[13c]2d hmqc nmr spectroscopy. the 13c nmr spectra showed two coupled resonances at 29.3 and 88.7 ppm which were assigned to the c-3 and c-2 of the covalent intermediate, and the 13c dept confirmed that c-3 was a methyl group and c-2 was quaternary.(abstract truncated  at 250 words)

AB  == a septicaemia klebsiella pneumoniae isolate from greece (ath1) was shown to be resistant to third generation cephalosporins, aztreonam and cefoxitin and this resistance was not decreased in the presence of clavulanic acid. the gene coding  for the resistance phenotype, associated with a beta-lactamase showing cephalosporinase activity and a pi of 8.6, could be transferred into escherichia  coli k-12 by conjugation and transformation. dna-hybridisation showed that this gene was located on two different plasmids, 7.8 and 80 kb respectively. the larger, conjugative plasmid also carried genes coding for another beta-lactamase  (pi 6.6) and resistance to aminoglycosides, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and trimethoprim. under highly stringent conditions the gene coding for the pi 8.6 beta-lactamase hybridised with chromosomal dna from citrobacter freundii os60 but not from e. coli or enterobacter cloacae. furthermore, the restriction map of this beta-lactamase gene corresponded to that of ampc from c. freundii os60. the  regulatory ampr gene could not be detected in the plasmid dna from the ath1 k. pneumoniae by dna hybridisation. the relationship between a plasmid-mediated extended spectrum beta-lactamase in a k. pneumoniae septicaemia isolate and chromosomal ampc beta-lactamase from c. freundii was demonstrated.

AB  == the outer membrane protein ompx of enterobacter cloacae shows high amino acid homology with virulence proteins pagc and rck from salmonella typhimurium and with ail from yersinia enterocolitica. here we demonstrate a role for ompx in the invasion of rabbit ileal tissue by e. cloacae. an organ culture system was used for maintenance of rabbit gut tissue during the experiments. the invasiveness of  three e. cloacae strains, which differed in ompx content, were compared with each other and with that of salmonella typhimurium tml (a highly invasive strain) and  s. typhimurium lt7 (a noninvasive strain). there was no significant difference between the invasiveness of the wild type and that of an ompx deletion mutant strain of e. cloacae; they were equally as invasive or less invasive than s. typhimurium lt7. the invasiveness of an ompx overproducer strain of e. cloacae was 10-fold higher than that of its immediate parent carrying only the multicopy  plasmid, higher than that of s. typhimurium lt7, but lower than that of s. typhimurium tml. the invasiveness of e. cloacae thus varied directly with the level of ompx in the outer membrane in rabbit ileal enterocytes challenged in situ.

AB  == klebsiella pneumoniae ba32, a clinical isolate from buenos aires, argentina, was  found to produce a plasmid-encoded beta-lactamase (fox-1) which conferred resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins and cephamycins. resistance could be  transferred by conjugation or transformation into escherichia coli k-12 via a 48.5-kb plasmid (pglk1) that produced two fox-1 molecular variants with isoelectric points of 6.8 and 7.2 and apparent molecular sizes of 37 and 35 kda,  respectively. the kinetic study revealed that the two variants had very similar substrate and inhibition profiles. these values resemble those of chromosomally mediated class c (group 1) cephalosporinases. the structural gene of fox-1 (blafox-1) was cloned into a 2,270-bp psti-psti fragment and was expressed in e.  coli tg1. the deduced 382-amino-acid sequence of fox-1 exhibited a high degree of similarity with chromosomally encoded ampc beta-lactamases of pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, e. coli, and citrobacter freundii. these findings suggest that fox-1 is a plasmid-mediated ampc-type beta-lactamase that is encoded by a single gene and that has two molecular variants.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of sy5555, a new oral penem antibiotic.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of sy5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. sy5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, morganella morganii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, clostridium spp., and bacteroides fragilis. against providencia spp., proteus spp., and haemophilus influenzae, sy5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. sy5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. enterococcus faecium, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. the bactericidal activities of sy5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the mics for clinical isolates of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. sy5555  was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. however, sy5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by x. maltophilia (l-1) and p. aeruginosa/pms354 beta-lactamases, two bush group 3 beta-lactamases, sy5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from  c. freundii gn7391 and e. cloacae gn7471 strains. these results suggest that sy5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == analysis of a carbapenem-hydrolyzing class a beta-lactamase from enterobacter cloacae and of its lysr-type regulatory protein.
AB  == carbapenems such as imipenem are extended-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics, which are not hydrolyzed by the beta-lactamases commonly found in enterobacteriaceae. here we report a gene encoding a carbapenemase, which was cloned from the chromosome of a clinical isolate of enterobacter cloacae, strain nor-1, into pacyc184 plasmid in escherichia coli. unlike all the sequenced carbapenemases, which are class b metallo-beta-lactamases, the mature protein (nmca) is a class a serine beta-lactamase. nmca shares the highest amino acid identity (50%) with the extended-spectrum class a beta-lactamase men-1 from e. coli. in the opposite orientation from the nmca promoter, an overlapping and divergent promoter was detected, along with an open reading frame, which encoded a 33.5-kda protein (nmcr). the nmcr amino acid sequence displays homology with lysr-type transcriptional regulatory proteins, including the conserved residues near its n  terminus within a helix-turn-helix motif. deletion of nmcr resulted in decreased  carbapenem resistance and a loss of beta-lactamase inducibility, demonstrating a  positive role of nmcr in nmca expression.

AB  == the in vitro activity of cp-99,219 was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 814 clinical bacterial isolates using a microdilution method with brain-heart infusion broth. cp-99,219 was the most potent agent tested against methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylocci (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was 32-fold and fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, respectively, against streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin g and erythromycin (mic90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was also the most potent agent tested against s. pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (mic90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). the activity of cp-99,219 against enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of sparfloxacin, with 90% of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, c.  diversus, helicobacter pylori, and k. oxytoca being inhibited by < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible, with mic90 values to cp-99,219 of 4, 2, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for bacteroides fragilis was 0.39 microgram/ml for cp-99,219 compared with 12.5 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. cp-99,219 was highly bactericidal at 1 x to 4 x mic against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; its activity was similar in nutrient, trypticase soy, and cation-supplemented mueller-hinton broths. the spectrum and potency observed with cp-99,219 warrant further testing with this novel quinolone.

AB  == the gene encoding the major nad(p)h-flavin oxidoreductase (flavin reductase) of the luminous bacterium vibrio fischeri atcc 7744 was isolated by using synthetic  oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme. nucleotide sequence analysis suggested that the major flavin reductase of v. fischeri consisted of 218 amino acids and had a calculated molecular weight of 24,562. cloned flavin reductase expressed in escherichia coli was purified virtually to homogeneity, and its basic biochemical properties were examined. as  in the major flavin reductase in crude extracts of v. fischeri, cloned flavin reductase showed broad substrate specificity and served well as a catalyst to supply reduced flavin mononucleotide (fmnh2) to the bioluminescence reaction. the major flavin reductase of v. fischeri not only showed significant similarity in amino acid sequence to oxygen-insensitive nad(p)h nitroreductases of salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter cloacae, and e. coli but also was associated with a low level of nitroreductase activity. the major flavin reductase of v. fischeri and the nitroreductases of members of the family enterobacteriaceae would thus appear closely related in evolution and form a novel protein family.

TI  == cloning and sequence analysis of the gene for a carbapenem-hydrolyzing class a beta-lactamase, sme-1, from serratia marcescens s6.
AB  == serratia marcescens s6 produces a pi 9.7 carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase that is probably encoded by the chromosome (y. yang, p. wu, and d. m. livermore,  antimicrob. agents chemother. 34:755-758, 1990). a total of 11.3 kb of genomic dna from this strain was cloned into plasmid pacyc184 in escherichia coli. after  further subclonings, the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase gene (blasme-1) was sequenced (embl accession number z28968). the gene corresponded to an 882-bp  open reading frame which encoded a 294-amino-acid polypeptide. this open reading  frame was preceded by a -10 and a -35 region consistent with a putative promoter  sequence of members of the family enterobacteriaceae. this promoter was active in e. coli and s. marcescens, as demonstrated by primer extension analysis. n-terminal sequencing showed that the sme-1 enzyme had a 27-amino-acid leader peptide and enabled calculation of the molecular mass of the mature protein (29.3 kda). sequence alignment revealed that sme-1 is a class a serine beta-lactamase and not a class b metalloenzyme. the earlier view that the enzyme was zinc dependent was discounted. among class a beta-lactamases, sme-1 had the greatest amino acid identity (70%) with the pi 6.9 carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase,  nmc-a, from enterobacter cloacae nor-1. comparison of these two protein sequences suggested a role for specific residues in carbapenem hydrolysis. the relatedness  of sme-1 to other class a beta-lactamases such as the tem and shv types was remote. this work details the sequence of the second carbapenem-hydrolyzing class a beta-lactamase from an enterobacterial species and the first in the genus serratia.

AB  == the prevalence of possible cross-transmission of selected bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococci) among infected patients was evaluated in  five intensive care units (icus) over 6 months. a total of 284 isolates from clinical specimens were typed by plasmid profile analysis (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae), restriction endonuclease analysis of plasmid dna (s. aureus), and/or pulse-field gel electrophoresis of chromosomal dna (p. aeruginosa, enterococci, s. aureus, and other bacteria without plasmid dna). by typing criteria, only 13% of the 177 isolates obtained after > 2 days in an icu were classified as possibly cross-transmitted. many patients whose cultures yielded bacteria of an identical type may have been the sources rather than the recipients of these organisms. episodes of possible cross-transmission were scattered among all icus, usually affected only two patients, and were associated with most bacterial species. these data suggest that endemic bacterial cross-transmission in icus is relatively infrequent and that cross-transmitted bacteria are not common causes of endemic icu-related nosocomial infections.

AB  == the bactericide quality of different materials containing copper (copper, brass,  brass-sheet) was tested and particularly the effect of humidity and copper-concentration was examined. in first examinations (i. communication) (19)  the materials were contaminated by hands, which were dipped into a suspension of  different microorganisms (micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa). the survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined after defined  exposure times (0, 5, 30, 60, 120 min). the following ways of contaminating the test materials were chosen: single contamination with wet hands, repeated contamination with wet and dry hands. in this examination the results were tested for statistical significance and in parallel experiments the copper-concentration on the surfaces of the materials was determined. materials containing copper contaminated with wet hands show a significant bactericide effect after an exposure time of 120 min. the bactericide effect on micrococcus luteus and pseudomonas aeruginosa is inhibited after contamination with dry hands. this results can not be explained by a different copper-concentration on the surfaces  of the materials, because a statistically significant difference of copper-ion concentrations between contamination with wet and dry hands could not be obtained.

TI  == the tryptophan repressor sequence is highly conserved among the enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == tryptophan biosynthesis in escherichia coli is regulated by the product of the trpr gene, the tryptophan (trp) repressor. trp aporepressor binds the corepressor, l-tryptophan, to form a holorepressor complex, which binds trp operator dna tightly, and inhibits transcription of the tryptophan biosynthetic operon. the conservation of trp operator sequences among enteric gram-negative bacteria suggests that trpr genes from other bacterial species can be cloned by complementation in e. coli. to clone trpr homologues, a deletion of the e. coli trpr gene, delta trpr504, was made on a plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis, then crossed onto the e. coli genome. plasmid clones of the trpr genes of enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter cloacae were isolated by complementation  of the delta trpr504 allele, scored as the ability to repress beta-galactosidase  synthesis from a prophage-borne trpe-lacz gene fusion. the predicted amino acid sequences of four enteric trpr proteins show differences, clustered on the backside of the folded repressor, opposite the dna-binding helix-turn-helix substructures. these differences are predicted to have little effect on the interactions of the aporepressor with tryptophan, holorepressor with operator dna, or tandemly bound holorepressor dimers with one another. although there is some variation observed at the dimer interface, interactions predicted to stabilize the interface are conserved. the phylogenetic relationships revealed by the trpr amino acid sequence alignment agree with the results of others.

AB  == azospirillum brasilense isolated from the rhizosphere of different plants has the ability to excrete indole-3-acetic acid (iaa) into the culture media. cosmid p0.2, isolated from an a. brasilense sp245 genome library in plafr1, complements  the tn5-induced mutant spm7918 of a. brasilense sp6 which excretes reduced amounts of iaa. restriction mapping and gene expression studies identified a bglii-ecori 4.3 kb fragment of p0.2 sufficient for the restoration of high levels of iaa production in mutant spm7918. tn5 mutagenesis localized the gene responsible on a 1.8 kb smai fragment. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that this fragment contains one complete open reading frame. the predicted protein sequence shows extensive homology with the indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase of enterobacter cloacae and the pyruvate decarboxylases of saccharomyces cerevisiae  and zymomonas mobilis. the a. brasilense mutant sp245a, constructed by homogenotization of a tn5 insertion derivative of the 1.8 kb smai fragment, also  displayed reduced iaa production. introduction of the cloned wild-type gene into  rhizobium meliloti 1021 resulted in increased iaa production. cell-free extracts  prepared from r. meliloti and a. brasilense transconjugants harboring this gene could convert indole-3-pyruvic acid to indole-3-acetaldehyde and tryptophol. these results clearly demonstrate that iaa production in a. brasilense is mediated by indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase.

TI  == role of residue lys315 in the mechanism of action of the enterobacter cloacae 908r beta-lactamase.
AB  == the role of the highly conserved lys315 residue in the catalytic mechanism of a class c beta-lactamase has been probed by site-directed mutagenesis. lys315 has been replaced by a histidine in the enterobacter cloacae 908r beta-lactamase, thus introducing a tritratable group to probe the role of the positive charge, and by a glutamine. the effects of these mutations have been studied on the kinetics of penicillin g and cephalothin turnover and on the pre-steady-state kinetics with carbenicillin at different ph. results showed that substrate binding was not impaired by the mutations, so that an interaction with the substrate-free carboxylate in the henri-michaelis complex could be ruled out. lys315 must have a catalytic role as shown by the decreased acylation and deacylation rates observed with the mutant enzymes. the mutants exhibited a lower activity at acidic ph, and this observation could be correlated with a decreased  affinity for (3-aminophenyl)boronate, a compound devoid of free carboxylate which binds to the active site and forms an adduct mimicking the tetrahedral intermediate. this suggested that lys315 was somehow involved in accelerating the nucleophilic substitutions along the reaction pathway. the study was extended to  modified substrates where the free carboxylate had been esterified. neither acylation nor deacylation seemed severely impaired with these compounds, showing  that the interaction between the enzyme and the substrate-free carboxylate did not play a major role in catalysis.

AB  == the antibiotic susceptibility of consecutive isolates of the upper respiratory tract pathogens streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, and staphylococcus aureus, (100 strains of each species collected each year during march through april 1985, 1988 and 1992)  to penicillin v, amoxycillin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, doxycycline, erythromycin, and cotrimoxazole was investigated by mic determination on pdm and pdm ii agar. the mics of the upper respiratory isolates from 1992 supplemented with 100 isolates each of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus saprophyticus collected during 1992 were determined  against the above antibiotics plus cefadroxil, cefpodoxime, roxithromycin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and bay y 3118. beta-lactamase production was found in  10% of h. influenzae and 80-90% of s. aureus and b. catarrhalis in 1992. among h. influenzae isolates, non-beta-lactamase-induced resistance to all beta-lactam antibiotics was first detected in 1988 and amounted to 3% of isolates in 1992. decreased susceptibility of s. preumoniae to penicillin (> or = 0.12 mg/l), co-trimoxazole > or = 32 mg/l, doxycycline (> or = 2 ml/l) and erythromycin (> or = 1 mg/l) was detected in 11%, 7%, and 8%, respectively, in 1992, which is significantly higher than in previous years at the same laboratory. decreased susceptibility of s. pyogenes to doxycycline and erythromycin was detected in 11% and 9% in 1992. the two most recently developed antibiotics, cefpodoxime and bay  y 3118, showed high antibacterial activity. the study emphasizes the need to screen for resistance mechanisms such as beta-lactamase production and lowered penicillin affinity.

TI  == [nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates from urinary tract to antimicrobial agents in japan, 1991].
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of urinary tract isolates to antimicrobial agents examined at 123 hospital laboratories in japan from september to december in 1991. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory. the susceptibility testing was performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by national committee for clinical laboratory standards. mrsa showed high resistance rates to all agents tested except to minocycline (mino). mssa had good susceptibility to imipenem (ipm) and cephalosporins with susceptibility rates higher than 90%. enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to ipm, ampicillin and piperacillin (pipc) and highly resistant to cephalosporins, gentamicin (gm), erythromycin, clindamycin and mino. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs, gm and ofloxacin (oflx). high susceptibility rates were observed for strains of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii to ipm, gm, and oflx and of serratia marcescens for ipm and  gm. pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were highly susceptible to ipm, ceftazidime, amk, cefsulodin, cefoperazone, pipc in this order.

TI  == comparative in-vitro activity of biapenem against enterobacteria with beta-lactamase-mediated antibiotic resistance.
AB  == the effects of enterobacterial beta-lactamases were studied for biapenem (l627),  a new carbapenem. susceptibility tests were performed for isogenic mutant series  of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, morganella morganii, serratia marcescens and proteus vulgaris which varied only in chromosomal beta-lactamase expression. beta-lactamase-derepressed organisms in these series were as susceptible as beta-lactamase-inducible strains to biapenem; beta-lactamase-basal mutants were up to eight-fold more susceptible. similar patterns of relative activity against the different expression types were noted for imipenem and biapenem. these data were related to direct induction and hydrolysis assays: biapenem, like imipenem, was a strong inducer of several class i enzymes and of the p. vulgaris cefuroximase and, like the other carbapenems, was only very slowly hydrolysed by these enzymes. moreover, like meropenem, biapenem reversibly deactivated these beta-lactamases. piperacillin and the cephalosporins, tested as comparators, were more labile than carbapenems to the class i enzymes, were weak  inducers below their mics and lacked deactivator function. in consequence their mics were higher for derepressed organisms than for those with inducible or basal beta-lactamase expression. unlike the carbapenems, they selected derepressed mutants from inducible populations. biapenem, like imipenem and meropenem, retained full activity against most transconjugants of escherichia coli k-12 that produced plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, including extended-spectrum tem mutants. only production of oxa-10 (previously pse-2) enzyme gave a slight reduction in susceptibility to the new carbapenem. biapenem resistance (mic 16 mg/l) did, however, occur in s. marcescens s6, which produced a chromosomal carbapenemase. this enzyme hydrolysed biapenem. overall, our findings indicate that biapenem shares the favourable properties of imipenem and meropenem in its interactions with the most important beta-lactamases of enterobacteria.

TI  == electric fields induce curved growth of enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and bacillus subtilis cells: implications for mechanisms of galvanotropism and bacterial growth.
AB  == directional growth in response to electric fields (galvanotropism) is known for eukaryotic cells as diverse as fibroblasts, neurons, algae, and fungal hyphae. the mechanism is not understood, but all proposals invoke actin either directly or indirectly. we applied electric fields to bacteria (which are inherently free  of actin) to determine whether actin was essential for galvanotropism. field-treated (but not control) enterobacter cloacae and escherichia coli cells curved rapidly toward the anode. the response was both field strength and ph dependent. the direction of curvature was reversed upon reversal of field polarity. the directional growth was not due to passive bending of the cells or to field-induced gradients of tropic substances in the medium. field-treated bacillus subtilis cells also curved, but the threshold was much higher than for e. cloacae or e. coli. since the curved morphology must reflect spatial differences in the rates of cell wall synthesis and degradation, we looked for regions of active wall growth. experiments in which the cells were decorated with latex beads revealed that the anode-facing ends of cells grew faster than the cathode-facing ends of the same cells. inhibitors of cell wall synthesis caused spheroplasts to form on the convex regions of field-treated cells, suggesting that the initial curvature resulted from enhanced growth of cathode-facing regions. our results indicate that an electric field modulates wall growth spatially and that the mechanism may involve differential stimulation of wall growth in both anode- and cathode-facing regions. electric fields may therefore serve as valuable tools for studies of bacterial wall growth. use of specific e.  coli mutants may allow dissection of the galvanotropic mechanism at the molecular level.

TI  == post-antibiotic effect of fk-037 and biapenem tested against five bacterial species.
AB  == the in-vitro post-antibiotic effect (pae) was determined for two newer beta-lactams, fk-037 (a cephalosporin) and biapenem (a carbapenem). our pae results for these drugs were consistent with what has been reported previously for similar beta-lactams, e.g. gram-positive organisms had measurable effects (0.4-2.2 hours), while gram-negatives had variable results (0.0 to 1.4 hours). even though the pae test conditions generally coincided with achievable clinical  levels for most organisms tested (< or = 4 mg/l for biapenem and < or = 8 mg/l for fk-037), the marginal or species dependent, short pae values support the selection of multiple daily doses (two-to-four) based on conventional pharmacokinetic parameters such as the cmax, auc, and serum elimination half-life.

TI  == plasmid labeling confirms bacterial translocation in pancreatitis.
AB  == to examine whether the gut is a source of infection in acute pancreatitis, bacterial translocation and alterations of intestinal microecology and morphology were studied in 16 dogs. dogs were colonized with a strain of escherichia coli (e. coli 6938k) bearing the plasmid puc4k, which confers kanamycin resistance. in eight dogs (group i), pancreatitis was induced by sodium taurocholate/trypsin injection. eight other dogs (group ii) underwent laparotomy only. the pancreas, mesenteric lymph nodes, peritoneal fluid, liver, and spleen were harvested 7 days later for culturing and histologic analysis. identification of e. coli 6938k was  accomplished by plasmid dna analysis. group i dogs had severe pancreatitis and ischemic changes in small bowel mucosa. group ii dogs had no changes. translocation to the pancreas occurred in five dogs and to mesenteric lymph nodes in six dogs with pancreatitis. no translocation occurred in group ii dogs (p < 0.05). in addition to e. coli 6938k, other gram-negative kanamycin-resistant species were isolated, including e. coli (other than 6938k) and enterobacter cloacae. enteric origin of these strains was confirmed by antibiography and plasmid dna analysis. no overgrowth of cecal gram-negative bacteria was found. this study suggests that the gut is a primary source of infection in pancreatitis and that ischemic damage of intestinal mucosa may promote bacterial translocation.

AB  == the postantibiotic effect (pae), the postantibiotic sub-mic effect (pa sme), and  the sub-mic effect (sme) of a new oral quinolone, sparfloxacin, were determined for different strains of gram-negative bacteria. a pae was induced by 10 x mic of sparfloxacin for 2 h and the antibiotic was then eliminated by washing and dilution. the pa sme was studied by adding different sub-mics during the postantibiotic phase, and the sme by exposing the controls to the sub-mics alone. growth curves were followed for 20 h by continuous monitoring of optical density  in an automatic incubator. sparfloxacin induced a pae of 0.9-2.4 h for all strains except two clinical strains of enterobacter cloacae. in accordance with earlier experiments with sparfloxacin and gram-positive bacteria, this study showed a pa sme that was nearly equal to the pae plus the effect of the subinhibitory concentration alone (sme).

TI  == antibiotic-induced release of endotoxin from bacteria in vitro.
AB  == the ability of cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin and tobramycin to cause release of endotoxin was examined in vitro with cultures of enterobacter cloacae  and escherichia coli. endotoxin was measured by a quantitative limulus amoebocyte lysate assay and its presence was confirmed by silver staining of the lipopolysaccharide moiety following sds-page. the morphology of the bacteria during antibiotic exposure was examined by scanning electronmicroscopy. cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin and piperacillin caused significant endotoxin release,  correlating with their ability to affect cell-wall morphology, causing filamentation, wall breakage and cell lysis. in contrast, little endotoxin was released when bacteria were exposed to tobramycin and no morphological changes were observed when bacteria were exposed to bactericidal concentrations of this aminoglycoside. its antimicrobial spectrum and bactericidal activity make tobramycin an appropriate agent for treatment of sepsis caused by gram-negative bacteria and its lack of propensity to elicit excessive release of endotoxin may  avoid exacerbation of endotoxin-related shock in sepsis.

TI  == [antibiotic sensitivity of gram negative bacilli isolated from urinary tract infections at nuhc of cotonou (benin) from march to december 1992].
AB  == eleven antibiotics were tested against 1,194 gram negative bacilli isolated from  urinary tract infections at the national university hospital center at cotonou. among the betalactams tested, only cefotaxime remained active against most of the bacteria tested: 90% of the strains of escherichia coli and 75% of the strains of enterobacter cloacae were sensitive. ampicilline, on the other hand, had lost its activity even on strains which are usually the most susceptible. thirteen percent of the e. coli strains were sensitive. this reduction in antibiotic activity against bacterial strains in cotonou, which concerned to various degrees the tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazole, is less pronounced for the amino-sides (gentamicine and netilmicine), and the quinolones of which nalidixique acid was active against 83.9% of the strains of e. coli. the low frequency of isolation of wild type strains (sensitive to betalactams) is probably the consequence of strong selection pressure due to a massive, and uncontrolled use of antibiotics in cotonou.

TI  == genetics of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  == bacteria have adapted to the introduction of aztreonam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime,  ceftriaxone and other oxyimino-beta-lactams by altering existing plasmid-mediated class a and class d beta-lactamases so as to expand their spectrum of activity. in the tem and shv families of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, relative activity toward oxyimino-substrates increases with the number of amino acid substitutions but at the price of lowered intrinsic efficiency, so that compensatory up-promoter events are often associated with increased enzyme expression. another new mechanism of resistance is the capture on plasmids of normally chromosomal genes from enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii or pseudomonas aeruginosa, which upon transfer can provide klebsiella pneumoniae or  escherichia coli with resistance to alpha-methoxy-beta-lactams, such as cefoxitin or cefotetan, as well as to oxyimino-beta-lactams.

TI  == [staghorn renal lithiasis treated with shock waves. bacteriologic aspects].
AB  == struvite renal stones are caused by infection of the urine with bacteria that synthesize the enzyme urease. ammonium is released by the breakdown of urea by urease, the urine becomes highly alkaline, and magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) and carbonate apatite crystallize. incorporation of the infecting bacteria within the developing stone, results in a focus of infection that is resistant to conventional antimicrobial therapy, and which is manifested clinically by repeated urinary tract infection caused by persistent bacteriuria.  extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (eswl) currently is accepted as the election treatment for most renal calculi. this trial examines the bacteriologic  aspects pre and post-eswl. eighty adult patients, 47 females and 33 males, without clinical signs of urinary tract infections (uti) were submitted to urine  cultures pre and post-eswl. the first 50 patients underwent during and post-eswl, 150 blood cultures, which all proved to be negative, confirming very low risk of  generalized sepsis. no patient presented fever, chills or rigors pre or postprocedures. with respect to urine cultures 43 patients (52.5%) had a pre-eswl uti, in comparison to 49 (60%) who had a uti post-eswl. the distribution of organisms pre and post-eswl was as follows: proteus mirabilis (22/22), escherichia coli (11/11), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4/5), klebsiella pneumoniae (2/2), enterobacter cloacae (0/1), alcaligenes odorans (1/2) enterococcus faecalis (1/3), staphylococcus saprophyticus (1/2) and candida albicans (1/1). in this study 6 patients presented bacteriuria post-eswl probably due to bacteria from inside the calculi. according to these results, the risk of bacteremia seems to be very low. in 60% of staghorn renal stones we could demonstrate a bacterial  infection.

TI  == evidence that the reaction of the udp-n-acetylglucosamine 1-carboxyvinyltransferase proceeds through the o-phosphothioketal of pyruvic acid bound to cys115 of the enzyme.
AB  == the enzyme udp-n-acetylglucosamine 1-carboxyvinyltransferase (enolpyruvyltransferase, ec 2.5.1.7) catalyses the transfer of the intact 1-carboxyvinyl moiety of phosphoenolpyruvate to the 3'-hydroxyl group of the glucosamine moiety of udp-(2')-n-acetylglucosamine with the concomitant release of inorganic phosphate, the first committed step in the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan. overexpression of the enzyme from enterobacter cloacae in escherichia coli allowed the isolation of large amounts of purified enzyme (approx. 900 mg/20 g fresh mass bacteria). by incubating the enzyme with 14c-labelled phosphoenolpyruvate, 32p-labelled orthophosphate and unlabelled udp-(2')-n-acetyl-(3')-1-carboxyvinylglucosamine, we were able to isolate and characterise a reaction intermediate, covalently bound to the protein. it contains stoichiometric quantities of the c3 moiety (0.98 mol/mol) as well as of  the phosphate moiety (0.95 mol/mol) of phosphoenolpyruvate relative to protein. the rapid turnover of this protein-bound intermediate in the presence of udp-(2')-n-acetylglucosamine towards the product udp-(2')-n-acetyl-(3')-1-carboxyvinylglucosamine suggests that the intermediate is kinetically competent. we also present evidence that the intermediate is bound as the o-phosphothioketal of pyruvic acid to cys115 of the enzyme. this is the same cys residue to which phosphomycin, an irreversible inhibitor of the udp-glcnac carboxyvinyltransferase, binds covalently. exchange of cys115 for a ser residue resulted in an inactive enzyme, demonstrating the essential role of cys115 for the reaction. the only other enzyme known to catalyse the transfer of  the intact 1-carboxyvinyl moiety of phosphoenolpyruvate to a substrate is the 3-phosphoshikimate 1-carboxyvinyltransferase (ec 2.5.1.19), the sixth enzyme of the shikimate pathway. the reaction of this synthase is known to proceed through  a single, tightly but not covalently bound, tetrahedral intermediate. even though the two enzymes share similarities in their primary amino acid sequences, their reaction mechanisms appear to be substantially different.

AB  == transfer of plasmid rp4 from escherichia coli k-12 donor strain to bacteria isolated from seawater was shown to occur on filters and in sterile seawater incubated at 24 degrees c. ten of 12 seawater isolates tested were recipient active for rp4 when the plasmid transfers were assessed by filter matings. when matings were performed in sterile seawater, seven of the 12 isolates received rp4. in sterile seawater, the transfer of rp4 from e. coli to pseudomonads was more efficient than transfer between e. coli strains. transfer of rp4 to indigenous seawater bacteria was shown to take place both on filters and in seawater amended with luria bertani broth. no transconjugants were found in experiments with unamended seawater, but in experiments with amended seawater 10(-7)-10(-6) transconjugants per recipient were found. in filter matings with a  100-fold-concentrated total population of indigenous seawater bacteria, the transfer efficiency of rp4 was 4 x 10(-5) per recipient. the majority of the isolated transconjugant seawater bacteria consisted of fluorescent pseudomonads,  but transconjugant strains of aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas cepacia, and enterobacter cloacae were also found. using an auxotrophic donor strain, selection of transconjugants on selective minimal media was shown to be an efficient strategy for detection of gene transfer to indigenous bacteria of seawater.

TI  == low-dosage cefepime as treatment for serious bacterial infections.
AB  == since infection develops in significant numbers of hospitalized patients, the problem of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins is of increasing concern. we evaluated the efficacy of cefepime 1 g bd as treatment for acute, moderately severe bacterial infection in 239 hospitalized patients (mean age 60 years). of these patients, 204 were evaluated clinically for urinary tract infection (uti) (n = 90), lower respiratory tract infection (lrti) (n = 70), skin and soft tissue infection (s/sti) (n = 12) and bacteraemia which was associated with either uti or lrti (n = 32) but not included in the previously mentioned uti and lrti groups. amongst the pathogens isolated (36 gram-positive, 150 gram-negative), the most predominant species were escherichia coli in uti and bacteraemia (n = 81), streptococcus pneumoniae in lrti and bacteraemia (n = 23),  haemophilus influenzae in lrti (n = 16), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4) and enterobacter cloacae (n = 2) in s/sti. the mean duration of treatment was 8.5 days and was the same for the 204 clinically evaluable patients. overall, the clinical cure rate for cefepime was 94% (191/204). pathogen eradication was achieved in 93% (185/199) of infections. of the patients with associated bacteraemia, the clinical cure rate was 97% (31/32) and 94% (16/17) of the pathogens were eradicated. cefepime therapy was well-tolerated. treatment was discontinued in eight patients (3%) because of local intolerance and in five patients (2%) because of drug-related adverse events (rash, headache and pruritus). cefepime 1 g bd is as safe and effective as other parenteral cephalosporins for the treatment of acute bacterial uti, lrti and s/sti, including those cases with associated bacteraemia. the bd dosing schedule and reported lack of cross-resistance with other cephalosporins against some species  of aerobic gram-negative bacilli make cefepime an attractive treatment option in  hospitalized patients.

AB  == in this examination the bactericide qualities of different materials were tested. particularly the effect of humidity was examined. 3 materials containing copper ("copper", "brass" and "brass sheet") and 2 materials not containing copper ("polyamide b" and "high-grade steel") were tested. the surfaces of the 5 types of material were contaminated with a suspension of 2 different bacteria species (staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus). after defined exposure times the  survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined by the standardized method of the "guidelines of the german society of hygiene and microbiology". additionally the sedimentation of airborne microorganisms on the materials was tested by determining the number of colony-forming-units after defined exposure times. in further examinations the materials were contaminated by hands, which were dipped into a suspension of different microorganisms (micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa). the following ways of contaminating the test materials were chosen: single contamination with wet hands, repeated contamination with wet and dry hands. after defined exposure times the survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined. the results show, a bactericide quality of copper depends on the percent of copper-content of the tested materials, exposure time, humidity, frequency of contamination and bacteria species. humidity and only single contamination cause  a reduction of bacteria. reduction of gram-negative bacteria is more easily than  reduction of gram-positive bacteria. enterococcus faecium shows the highest, pseudomonas aeruginosa the lowest reduction rate of bacteria in the following sequence: enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal titers of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin following multiple oral doses in healthy volunteers.
AB  == fourteen adult males participated in a randomized three-way crossover study to compare the pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal titers (sbts) of 500 mg of ciprofloxacin (regimen a), 750 mg of ciprofloxacin (regimen b), and 400 mg of ofloxacin (regimen c) administered every 12 h for seven doses. mean steady-state  peak concentrations in serum for regimens a, b, and c were 3.0, 4.4, and 6.5 micrograms/ml, respectively (p < 0.01, all comparisons) and mean half-lives were  4.5, 4.3, and 6.5 h, respectively (p < 0.05, c versus a and b). mean steady-state areas under the concentration-time curve were 14.1, 21.1, and 48.1 micrograms/h/ml for regimens a, b, and c, respectively (p < 0.05, all comparisons). sbts were determined at different times postdose for three isolates each of streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. mean steady-state peak sbts for regimens a, b, and c, respectively, were as follows: s. pneumoniae, < 1:2, 1:8, 1:8, s. aureus, 1:16, 1:16, 1:16; e. coli, 1: > or = 128, 1: > or = 128, 1:64; e. cloacae, 1: > or = 128, 1: > or = 128, 1:64; p. aeruginosa, 1:8, 1:8, 1:2. these  differences in sbts within each genus were statistically significant. the majority of predicted sbts were within one dilution of measured sbts. areas under the serum bactericidal time curves for e. coli, e. cloacae, and p. aeruginosa were significantly higher for ciprofloxacin; areas under the serum bactericidal time curves for s. pneumoniae and s. aureus were significantly greater for ofloxacin. ofloxacin achieved higher concentrations in serum than ciprofloxacin,  but differences in in vitro activity were a more important determinant of sbts.

TI  == analysis of the aac(3)-via gene encoding a novel 3-n-acetyltransferase.
AB  == biochemical analysis (g. a. papanicolaou, r. s. hare, r. mierzwa, and g. h. miller, abstr. 152, program abstr. 29th intersci. conf. antimicrob. agents chemother., 1989) demonstrated the presence of a novel 3-n-acetyltransferase in enterobacter cloacae 88020217. this organism was resistant to gentamicin, and the mic of 2'-n-ethylnetilmicin for it was fourfold lower than that of 6'-n-ethylnetilmicin, a resistance pattern which suggested 2'-acetylating activity. however, high-pressure liquid chromatography analysis demonstrated that the enzyme acetylated sisomicin in the 3 position. we have cloned the structural  gene for this enzyme from a large (> 70-kb) conjugative plasmid present in e. cloacae. subcloning experiments have localized the aac(3)-via gene to a 2.1-kb sau3a fragment. the deduced aac(3)-via protein showed 48% amino acid identity to  the aac(3)-iia protein and 39% identity to the aac(3)-vii protein. examination of the 5'-flanking sequences demonstrated that the aac(3)-via gene was located 167 bp downstream of the aada1 gene and was present in an integron. in addition, the  aac(3)-via gene is also downstream of a 59-base element often seen in an integron environment. primer extension analysis has identified a promoter for the aac(3)-via gene downstream of both the aada1 gene and a 59-base element.

TI  == in vitro experiments on catheter-related infections due to gram-negative rods.
AB  == although many complications may arise with the use of central venous catheters, catheter-related bacteremia is considered to be the most serious complication. microflora on the patient's skin (coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus) is thought to represent the major source of microorganisms causing catheter-related infections. gram-negative rods are increasingly observed as causative agents. we therefore performed an in vitro study to elucidate the pathogenesis of polymer-associated infections caused by enterobacteriaceae and nonfermenters and to study the resistance of polymer surface-grown gram-negative  rods against antibiotics. using a modification of the semiquantitative method for culturing vascular cannulas on solid media described by maki et al., we studied the adherence of various gram-negative rods to 1-cm segments of silastic catheters, a material used for port-a-cath-systems. organisms were obtained from  the american type culture collection (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae). all organisms but klebsiella showed extensive irreversible adherence. production of an extracellular slime substance was observed only with antimicrobially treated pseudomonas. after 'infection', the silastic catheter segments were treated with  various antimicrobial agents. the following antibiotics were used either individually or in combination: cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, fosfomycin and gentamicin. despite the fact that the antibiotic concentrations used were many times greater than the respective mics of the various antibiotics, none of the antibiotics tested succeeded in eliminating the organisms. e. coli was found  to be the most susceptible organism. these in vitro data substantiate our clinical impression that it is hardly possible to successfully eliminate the colonization of central venous catheters with gram-negative rods by using the antimicrobial agents employed here.

TI  == antitumor activities of a cephalosporin prodrug in combination with monoclonal antibody-beta-lactamase conjugates.
AB  == 7-(phenylacetamido)cephalosporin mustard (cm) and 7-(4-carboxybutanamido)cephalosporin mustard (ccm) were developed as anticancer prodrugs that could be activated site selectively by monoclonal antibody-beta-lactamase conjugates targeted to antigens present on tumor cell surfaces. both cm and ccm were hydrolyzed by purified beta-lactamases from escherichia coli (ec beta l), bacillus cereus (bc beta l), and enterobacter cloacae (ecl beta l). this resulted in the release of phenylenediamine mustard (pdm), a potent cytotoxic drug. the km and kcat values of the reactions were determined, and it was found that ecl beta l effected the hydrolysis of cm and ccm more rapidly than the other enzymes. conjugates of ecl beta l were prepared by reacting maleimide-substituted f(ab')2 fragments of the monoclonal antibodies  l6 and p1.17 to ecl beta l that had been modified with sulfhydryl groups. in vitro experiments indicated that ccm (ic50 = 25-45 microm) was less toxic than pdm (ic50 = 1.5 microm) to h2981 lung adenocarcinoma cells (l6 antigen positive,  p1.17 antigen negative) and that immunologically specific prodrug activation took place when the cells were treated with l6-ecl beta l. in vivo experiments in nude mice demonstrated that ccm was less toxic than cm, and that both prodrugs were much less toxic than pdm. neither ccm nor pdm exerted antitumor activity on subcutaneous h2981 tumors in vivo. however, a significant antitumor effect was obtained in mice that received l6-ecl beta l 96 h prior to the administration of  ccm. the effect was immunologically specific (p < 0.05), since a smaller degree of antitumor activity was obtained in mice that received the nonbinding control conjugate p1.17-ecl beta l prior to ccm.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == ex vivo pharmacodynamic study of piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam, compared with ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid.
AB  == ten volunteers received piperacillin (4 g), piperacillin (4 g) plus tazobactam (0.5 g) (tazocin), and ticarcillin (3 g) plus clavulanic acid (0.2 g) (timentin)  intravenously over 30 min in a cross-over blinded scheme. blood samples were obtained 0.5 and 3 h after the end of infusion to measure by (high-pressure liquid chromatography) the concentration and bactericidal titers against 70 gram-negative bacilli. serum time-kill curves were done against 35 strains to measure killing rates and area under the time-kill curve. using the measure of serum bactericidal activity, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid and piperacillin-tazobactam were equally effective against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and bacteroides fragilis. piperacillin-tazobactam was superior to ticarcillin-clavulanic acid against piperacillin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae (4 to 16 times) and s. marcescens (2 to 4 times). by using the area under the time-kill curve, piperacillin-tazobactam was equivalent to ticarcillin-clavulanic acid against piperacillin-susceptible strains; piperacillin-tazobactam was significantly more  active than piperacillin against piperacillin-resistant strains and was more active than ticarcillin-clavulanic acid when the sample obtained 3 h after the end of infusion to volunteers was considered. serum piperacillin concentrations (mean +/- standard error of the mean; in mg/liter) were 115 +/- 13 at 0.5 h and 7.4 +/- 1.4 at 3 h after the administration of piperacillin alone and 105.5 +/- 12.6 (0.5 h) and 7.7 +/- 1.6 after the administration of piperacillin-tazobactam. serum tazobactam concentrations (in milligram per liter) were 13.1 +/- 1.4 at 0.5 h and 1.2 +/- 0.2 at 3 h. the piperacillin-tazobactam ratio was 8 +/- 0.3 at 0.5  h and 6.2 +/- 0.5 at 3 h. piperacillin-tazobactam appears promising against beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacilli.

AB  == between april and october 1990, photosensitivity reactions were observed in 19 out of 338 patients who were administered lomefloxacin (lflx) for the treatment of urinary tract infections (uti) in our hospital. to certify the effectiveness and safety of lflx to uti, we carried out a controlled study with fixed dosages and durations. patients with acute uncomplicated uti and chronic complicated uti  were enrolled and lflx dosages of 200 mg b.i.d. for 7 days and 14 days, respectively, were administered. the overall efficacy rates were 100% and 84% respectively. concerning the bacteriological effect, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were eliminated in every case, while 3 strains of enterococcus faecalis 2 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and one strain of enterobacter cloacae persisted. no photosensitivity reaction or noteworthy severe adverse reactions were observed among 200 cases enrolled in this study of restricted dosages and durations. we, urologists, need to be well-informed about  photosensitivity reactions induced by quinolone antimicrobial agents. lflx was proven to be effective in uti without showing any photosensitivity reactions when administered by our fixed dosages and durations.

TI  == dna-based diagnostic tests for salmonella species targeting agfa, the structural  gene for thin, aggregative fimbriae.
AB  == salmonella enteritidis 27655-3b and a few diarrheagenic escherichia coli strains  produce morphologically and antigenically related, thin, aggregative fimbriae, collectively named gvvpq fimbriae (s. k. collinson, l. emody, t. j. trust, and w. w. kay, j. bacteriol. 174:4490-4495, 1992). to determine whether gvvpq fimbriae are common to salmonella spp. and other enteropathogenic members of the family enterobacteriaceae, 113 isolates were phenotypically screened for congo red binding and aggregative colony morphology. presumptive positive and representative negative strains were examined by western blotting (immunoblotting) by using antiserum to sef 17, the native gvvpq fimbria of s. enteritidis. only four s. enteritidis strains and six e. coli isolates possessed  substantial amounts of gvvpq fimbriae after 24 h of incubation on t medium. following 5 days of incubation, 56 of 93 salmonella isolates (60%) and 1 of 7 additional e. coli clinical isolates possessed detectable levels of gvvpq fimbriae. since variable expression of gvvpq fimbriae was observed among salmonella isolates and some e. coli strains produced scant amounts, as revealed  by immunoelectron microscopy, the ability to produce these fimbriae was evaluated by genotypic screening. the structural gene for the sef 17 fimbrin, agfa, was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, cloned, and sequenced to provide a characterized dna probe. an agfa dna fragment hybridized strongly to 603 of 604 (99.8%) salmonella isolates but very weakly to 31 of 266 other members of the family enterobacteriaceae including 26 of 137 e. coli strains, 3 of 14 citrobacter spp., and single isolates of shigella sonnei and enterobacter cloacae. the agfa dna probe proved to be a valuable diagnostic tool for salmonella isolates arrayed on hydrophobic grid membrane filters. unique agfa sequences were targeted in the development of a polymerase chain reaction assay specific for salmonella spp.

AB  == a controlled clinical comparison was made of the isolator (wampole laboratories,  cranbury, n.j.) and the septi-chek release bottle (roche diagnostics, nutley, n.j.). from 6,345 blood culture sets fulfilling minimum criteria for volume of blood cultured, 840 strains were isolated, of which only 691 (82%) were considered to be representative of bloodstream infection according to centers for disease control definitions. statistically significant differences were found between the systems for the following organisms, which were all detected more frequently in the isolator system: staphylococcus aureus (p = 0.0001), alcaligenes xylosoxidans (p = 0.008), klebsiella pneumoniae (p = 0.05), salmonella spp. (p = 0.03), and candida albicans (p = 0.02). the septi-chek release system required a longer period of time than the isolator system for detection of the following organisms:s. aureus (p = 0.0001), enterococcus spp. (p = 0.0001), enterobacter cloacae (p = 0.03), escherichia coli (p = 0.0001), klebsiella oxytoca (p = 0.03), k. pneumoniae (p = 0.02), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p = 0.002), and c. albicans (p = 0.005). there were 430 episodes of bloodstream  infections identified in the study; of these episodes, only those due to s. aureus were detected significantly more frequently (p = 0.0001) by the isolator system than by the septi-chek release system. however, episodes of bloodstream infections due to s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus spp., and e. coli were detected significantly faster by the isolator system.

AB  == the pathogenic flora, isolated from burn wounds of patients admitted to a burn care unit during the years between 1976 and 1988 were typed and the in vitro susceptibility to antibacterial agents was recorded. between 1976 and 1988 the general therapeutic approach was changed three times, in congruence with the prevalent nosocomial bacterial resistance. the most frequent isolates were: pseud. aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus spp., proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella spp. and other enterobacteriaceae, such as acinetobacter, citrobacter. the most striking finding was the increase in antibiotic-resistant enterococcus isolates. staph. aureus, klebsiella and e. cloacae showed susceptibility to cephalosporins, imipenem, pefloxacin, vancomycin; enterococcus susceptibility to pefloxacin and vancomycin, and pseud. aeruginosa sensitivity to piperacillin, amikacin, tobramycin was generally good. e. coli showed a satisfactory susceptibility on average, and p. mirabilis showed a good sensitivity to piperacillin, cephalosporins, amikacin, tobramycin, aztreonam and imipenem. thus, the general bacterial flora and susceptibility have remained mostly unchanged over the years, with the conspicuous exception of enterococcus spp. and e. cloacae, which demonstrated a marked increase in incidence, with a concomitant dramatic decrease in the sensitivity of enterococcus spp. to antibiotics.

AB  == common lots of reference mic (minimum inhibitory concentration) method reagents were used to monitor ofloxacin, a newer fluoroquinolone, and 13 other drugs against 3200 recent clinical isolates in february-april 1992. five medical centers in the united states and canada contributed 640 strains per facility as follows: escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, klebsiella spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa (100 strains each); streptococcus pneumoniae (40 strains); and enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis (20 strains each). quality-control strains were processed concurrently, mics recorded, and data processed at a common location. selected ofloxacin-resistant isolates were retested at a reference laboratory to confirm resistances and determine cross-resistant patterns. results indicate the following (a) fluoroquinolones were superior in usable spectrum of activity to other orally administered drugs (for example, cefaclor, cefixime, ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, minocycline, oxacillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole); (b) ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were generally equal to gentamicin and cefotaxime against commonly isolated gram-negative pathogens; (c) fluoroquinolone resistance was rare among enteric bacilli, pneumococci (ciprofloxacin > ofloxacin), h. influenzae, and m. catarrhalis, but more common among oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and p. aeruginosa; (d) cross  resistance was generally observed between ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin but was species or genus dependent; and (e) a new fluoroquinolone, levofloxacin, demonstrated promising activity against contemporary pathogens.

TI  == ampg, a signal transducer in chromosomal beta-lactamase induction.
AB  == the chromosomal ampc beta-lactamase in citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae is inducible by beta-lactam antibiotics. when an inducible ampc gene is introduced on a plasmid into escherichia coli together with its transcriptional regulator ampr, the plasmid-borne beta-lactamase is still inducible. we have isolated mutants, containing alterations in a novel e. coli gene, ampg, in which  a cloned c. freundii ampc gene is unable to respond to beta-lactam inducers. the  ampg gene was cloned, sequenced and mapped to minute 9.6 on the e. coli chromosome. the deduced amino acid sequence predicted ampg to be a 53 kda, transmembrane protein, which we propose acts as a signal transducer or permease in the beta-lactamase induction system. immediately upstream of ampg there is another 579-base-pair-long open reading frame (orf) encoding a putative lipoprotein shown to be non-essential for beta-lactamase induction. we have found that ampg and this orf form an operon, whose promoter is located in front of the  orf. located closely upstream of the putative promoter is the morphogene bola, which is transcribed in the opposite orientation. however, using transcription fusions, we have found that the ampg transcription is not regulated by bola. in addition, we show that transcription is probably not regulated by either the starvation specific sigma factor rpos, which controls bola, or by ampd the negative regulator for ampc transcription.

TI  == bacterial flora detected of the uterine endometrial cavity of diabetic patients with myoma uteri.
AB  == patients with diabetes frequently suffer from various postoperative complications, especially infection. diabetic patients also have a high incidence of uterine endometrial cancer. the nature of the intrauterine bacterial flora may be related to both infection and carcinogenesis. therefore, identification of the intrauterine bacterial flora in diabetic patients may be useful. bacteria were detected in the uterine endometrial cavity of 100% of ten diabetic patients with  myoma uteri. however, among 20 non-diabetic control patients with myoma uteri, only three 15% harbored bacteria. members of the enterobacteriaceae (escherichia  coli, proteus spp., enterobacter cloacae, and klebsiella pneumoniae) were the predominant bacteria. we speculate that bacterial products contribute to carcinogenesis, as has been proposed for colon carcinoma. antimicrobial agents active against enterobacteriaceae should be used to prevent postoperative infections in gynecologic procedures in diabetic patients.

AB  == in order to determine the incidence of infection following sclerotherapy and the  role of antimicrobial prophylaxis, a prospective randomized control study was performed comparing i.v. imipenem/cilastatin, with an infusion of dextrose-saline as a control group. one hundred patients with bleeding esophageal varices were included. all episodes of infection were documented during admission to the unit. ninety-seven patients were evaluable. post-sclerotherapy bacteremia developed in  six (5.6%) of 107 sclerotherapy sessions in the control group and one (1.1%) of the 88 sclerotherapy sessions in the imipenem/cilastatin group (p < or = 0.1, ns): six of these seven post-sclerotherapy bacteremias occurred after emergency sclerotherapy. infection within 7 days of the procedure was documented after 43 (22.1%) of the 195 sclerotherapy sessions, 18 (20.5%) in the imipenem/cilastatin  group and 25 (23.4%) in the control group (p = ns). these infections were significantly more common after emergency sclerotherapy, 40 (34.8%) of 115 sessions, than after elective sclerotherapy, three (3.8%) of 80 sessions (p < or  = 0.0001). a short prophylactic antibiotic regime does not reduce the risk of early bacteremia or the frequency of infection after sclerotherapy. the higher risk of infection after emergency sclerotherapy may be therefore related more to  the gastrointestinal hemorrhage and its associated effects than to sclerotherapy.

TI  == a two-part energy burden imposed by growth of enterobacter cloacae and escherichia coli in sodium dodecyl sulfate.
AB  == enterobacter cloacae, like most enteric bacteria, can grow in the presence of 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds). the bacteria tolerate the detergent and do not metabolize it. in a defined glucose-salts medium the growth rate remained unchanged (g = 55 min) as the detergent concentration was increased from 0 to 10% sds. however, growth in sds exhibited a two-part energy dependence. in part 1, the sds-grown cells underwent rapid lysis when they ran out of energy. cells that had entered stationary phase owing to carbon limitation lysed, while those that had entered owing to nitrogen or phosphorus limitation did not. we attribute part 1 of the energy dependence to sds as a detergent. in part 2, the cells grown in 5 or 10% sds exhibited longer lag periods, potassium accumulation, decreased cell yields, and higher oxygen consumption. the higher oxygen consumption occurred during both exponential phase and nitrogen-limited stationary phase. however, the decreased cell yield and higher oxygen consumption of sds-grown cells were mimicked by cells grown in equivalent concentrations of sucrose or polyethylene glycol. we attribute part 2 of the energy dependence to sds as a solute. finally, with regard to the as yet unidentified bacterial osmotic stress detector, we used the micelle-forming nature of sds to conclude that the detector was responding to turgor pressure-water activity rather than to osmolarity itself.

TI  == biochemical properties of a carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase from enterobacter cloacae and cloning of the gene into escherichia coli.
AB  == a clinical isolate of enterobacter cloacae, strain nor-1, exhibited resistance to imipenem and remained susceptible to extended-spectrum cephalosporins. clavulanic acid partially restored the susceptibility of the strain to imipenem. two beta-lactamases with isoelectric points (pi) of 6.9 and > 9.2 were detected in strain e. cloacae nor-1; the higher pi corresponded to ampc cephalosporinase. plasmid dna was not detected in e. cloacae nor-1 and imipenem resistance could not be transferred into escherichia coli jm109. the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase gene was cloned into plasmid pacyc184. one recombinant plasmid, pptn1, harbored a 5.3-kb sau3a fragment from e. cloacae nor-1 expressing the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase. this enzyme (pi 6.9) hydrolyzed ampicillin, cephalothin, and imipenem more rapidly than it did meropenem and aztreonam, but it hydrolyzed extended-spectrum cephalosporins only weakly and did not hydrolyze cefoxitin. hydrolytic activity was partially inhibited by clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and tazobactam, was nonsusceptible to chelating agents such as edta and 1,10-o-phenanthroline, and was independent of the presence of zncl2. its relative molecular mass was 30,000 da. induction experiments concluded that the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase biosynthesis was inducible by cefoxitin and imipenem. subcloning experiments with hindiii partial digests of pptn1 resulted in a recombinant plasmid, designated pptn2, which contained a 1.3-kb insert from pptn1 and which conferred resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. hybridization studies performed with a 1.2-kb hindiii fragment from pptn2 failed to determine any homology with ampc of e. cloacae, with other known beta-lactamase genes commonly found in members of the family enterobacteriaceae (bla(tem-1)) and bla(shv-3) derivatives), and with previously  described carbapenemase genes such as those from xanthomonas maltophilia, bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis (cfia), and aeromonas hydrophila (cpha). this work describing the biochemical properties of a novel chromosome-encoded beta-lactamase from e. cloacae indicates that this enzyme differs from all the previously described carbapenemases. this is the first reported cloning of a carbapenem-hydrolyzing gene from a member of the family enterobacteriaceae.

AB  == a clinical isolate of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to a wide variety of beta-lactams, including third generation cephalosporins, aztreonam and cephamycins, as well as to beta-lactam/clavulanate and sulbactam combinations was examined. it was found that this resistance was transmissible to escherichia coli recipients via a small 5.3 mda plasmid encoding for an unusual beta-lactamase produced in relatively large quantities. the enzyme, designated lat-1, exhibited  a highly basic isoelectric point (pi = 9.4) and its hydrolytic activity resembled closely that of a class-i chromosomal cephalosporinase. in vitro, lat-1 hydrolysed cephaloridine, cephalothin and cephalexin more rapidly than penicillins. a slow hydrolysis of cefoxitin, ceftibuten, ceftazidime and cefotaxime was also observed. the enzyme was inhibited by low concentrations of aztreonam and cloxacillin but it was virtually unaffected by clavulanate. under stringent conditions, the lat-1 encoding plasmid did not hybridize with probes specific for tem-1 and enterobacter cloacae ampc beta-lactamase genes. the plasmid was not self-transferable but was readily mobilized by a conjugative r-plasmid harboured by the same k. pneumoniae strain.

AB  == pseudomonas cepacia 249 produces an inducible beta-lactamase with penicillinase activity. the nucleotide sequence of the pena gene, which encodes this beta-lactamase, was determined and found to include regions with a significant homology to the ampc-encoded beta-lactamases of members of the family enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the predicted amino acid sequence  of the pena beta-lactamase contained 17 amino acids immediately preceding the putative active-site serine which were highly conserved among the enzymes of the  ampc family. although the pena-coding sequence had a total gc content of 60%, the predicted codon usage was more characteristic of escherichia coli ampc-encoded beta-lactamase, with 53% of the codons having g or c in the third position, in contrast to the values for the p. aeruginosa ampc (88.5%) or pseudomonas cepacia  (88 to 92%) metabolic genes. the inducible expression of pena can be regulated by the e. coli gene product ampd. a putative p. cepacia ampr homolog was associated  with the positive regulation of both enterobacter cloacae ampc and p. cepacia pena expression, as confirmed by gel retardation studies. the e. cloacae ampr did not regulate pena expression. thus, by homology studies, codon usage, and genetic analysis, the p. cepacia pena beta-lactamase appears to have been acquired from members of the family enterobacteriaceae and belongs to the class c group of beta-lactamases.

TI  == the use of colonization rate and epidemic index as tools to illustrate the epidemiology of faecal enterobacteriaceae strains in swedish neonatal wards.
AB  == the epidemiology of faecal gram-negative bacteria was studied in 953 infants from 22 neonatal special care wards in swedish hospitals. two complementary methods to measure presumed nosocomial transmission of bacterial strains were used: the prevalence rate of major (m) phenotypes (strains that had colonized at least 10%  of the infants in a particular ward) and the epidemic index (ei) (which measures  the probability of isolating identical strains from different infants in a ward). about 1500 strains of the most common species (klebsiella spp., escherichia coli  and enterobacter cloacae) were typed by the phene plate (php) biochemical fingerprinting system, and selected klebsiella isolates were also typed by k antigen serotyping. klebsiella spp. showed a high propensity to spread (median ei 0.034, max 0.234), whereas e. coli (median ei 0.006, max 0.140) and e. cloacae (median ei 0.0, max 0.012) were more seldom involved in outbreaks. high total eis in the wards were correlated with high cephalosporin usage (rs = -0.56, p < 0.05). a total of about 600 biochemical phenotypes of enterobacteriaceae strains  were isolated from the 953 infants. most of these were found in only one or a few infants, but 24 m phenotypes belonging to klebsiella spp. (n = 19), e. coli (n =  4) and e. cloacae (n = 1) had colonized altogether 239 (25%) infants. klebsiella  m phenotypes similar or identical to each other and carrying k antigen 55 were isolated from 108 (11%) infants in eight wards, and were thus responsible for 45% of the m phenotype carrier rate in all studied infants. it is suggested that they represent a clone of klebsiella with a high ability to multiply and spread in hospital environments.

TI  == effect of antibiotics on endotoxin release from gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == antibiotics may inhibit bacterial growth or may kill bacteria by inhibiting cell  wall synthesis or protein synthesis. the amount of endotoxin released during antibiotic action has been found to be clinically important. nine antibiotics, representing seven classes, were studied for the amounts of endotoxin released during their action on susceptible strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. staphylococcus aureus, which produces no endotoxin, was used as a control organism. aztreonam induced the highest release of endotoxin, whereas other antibiotics such as imipenem and the quinolones induced the lowest release of endotoxin. although the quantities of endotoxin released are not easily explained from the established mechanisms of antibiotic action, our findings may have implications for therapy of the acutely ill, septic patient in whom release of large quantities of endotoxin may be catastrophic.

TI  == decimal assay for additivity of drugs permits delineation of synergy and antagonism.
AB  == although there are many in vitro tests for drug interactions, few possess a linear, predictable dose-dependent end point or have a precise definition for additivity. therefore, a new test with both of these features, the decimal assay  for additivity, was developed. this test is based on a disk diffusion assay and the strict linear relationship between drug mass and size of the inhibition zone. when the decimal assay for additivity was applied to combinations known on a mechanistic basis to be additive, synergistic, or antagonistic, results of the new test always reflected the expected drug interaction. for example, synergy between trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole was detected in tests with escherichia  coli and haemophilus influenzae, as was antagonism between cefoxitin and cefotaxime in tests with enterobacter cloacae. quinolones plus chloramphenicol appeared to be antagonistic. in addition to correctly identifying the drug interaction, the decimal assay for additivity identified the drug ratio producing the maximal drug interaction. these results suggest that the decimal assay for additivity should prove very useful in future studies of drug interactions.

TI  == sequences of wild-type and mutant ampd genes of citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == the ampd gene product regulates the expression of ampc beta-lactamase in gram-negative bacteria and is proposed to be involved in peptidoglycan metabolism. in this study, we sequenced the ampd wild type and three mutant genes of enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii. they exhibited a high degree of homology with the corresponding gene of escherichia coli except in the carboxy termini, where, in the wild-type genes of e. cloacae and c. freundii, four additional amino acids yielding the ser-x-x-lys motif were found. evidence that this c-terminal region of the ampd gene product is necessary for activity was shown by constructing a deletion of the last 16 amino acids. the spontaneous mutation of ampd02 is an out-of-frame insertion and yields an inactive ampd protein. the single-base-pair substitution of gly for asp-121 in ampd05 is responsible for a hyperinducible phenotype. these results demonstrate regions of  the ampd gene and the corresponding protein which have functional importance for  the induction of ampc beta-lactamase in e. cloacae.

TI  == antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of unripe papaya.
AB  == the meat, seed and pulp of carica papaya linn., a popular traditional medicinal herb grown in the tropics, was shown by the agar-cup method to be bacteriostatic  against several enteropathogens such as bacillus subtilis, enterobacter cloacae,  escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae. the same parts of papaya were  unequivocably demonstrated by electron spin resonance spectrometry to scavenge 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (5.8 x 10(14) spins/ml), hydroxyl (5.1 x 10(14) spins/ml) and superoxide (1.2 x 10(14) spins/ml) radicals with the seed giving the highest activity at concentrations (ic50) of 2.1, 10.0 and 8.7 mg/ml, respectively. the superoxide dismutase (sod)-like activity in the meat, seed and  pulp amounts to about 32, 98 and 33 units/ml; comparable to those of soybean paste miso, rice bran and baker's yeast. vitamin c, malic acid, citric acid and glucose are some of the possible antioxidative components in papaya. our study correlates the bacteriostatic activity of papaya with its scavenging action on superoxide and hydroxyl radicals which could be part of the cellular metabolism of such enteropathogens. this is indicative of the pathophysiological role of these reactive oxygen species in gastrointestinal diseases and papaya's ability to counteract the oxidative stress.

TI  == phospholipid impregnation of abdominal rubber drains: resistance to bacterial adherence but no effect on drain-induced bacterial translocation.
AB  == in order to evaluate the effect of surface modification of biomaterials on bacterial adherence and bacterial translocation after intraperitoneal biomaterial implantation, phosphatidylcholine- or phosphatidylinositol-impregnated rubber drain pieces, which had been intraperitoneally implanted in the rat for 2 and 7 days, or unimplanted, were incubated in vitro with 3h-labelled escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae. as compared with unimpregnated pieces, the adherence of bacteria significantly decreased to phosphatidylcholine- and phosphatidylinositol-impregnated rubber drain pieces that were either unimplanted or implanted for 2 days, but not for 7 days. the supplementation of albumin in the medium reduced the adherence of bacteria to the unimplanted, unimpregnated drain pieces, but did not further decrease adherence of bacteria to the unimplanted, phospholipid-impregnated brain pieces. bacterial growth was inhibited after incubation in nutrient broth supplemented with phospholipids. the incidence of enteric bacterial translocation induced by intraperitoneal drain implantation did not differ between phospholipid-impregnated and unimpregnated drain pieces. scanning electron microscopy revealed a large amount of biofilm and fibrous deposition on the surface of the implanted, phospholipid-impregnated rubber drain pieces. thus, phospholipid impregnation of rubber drains reduces bacterial adherence and inhibits bacterial growth, without influencing the incidence of bacterial translocation.

TI  == bacterial galvanotropism: mechanisms and applications.
AB  == galvanotropism is the process by which a cell alters its shape to grow directionally in response to an electric field. this phenomenon is known for a wide variety of eukaryotic cells but the first report of bacterial galvanotropism appeared only recently. escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and (to a lesser extent) bacillus subtilis curve rapidly and reversibly towards the anode of a uniform electric field. the mechanism for the response is not known but two observations permit a degree of speculation. firstly, the anode-facing ends of cells elongate more rapidly than the cathode-facing ends of the same cells, suggesting that the field affects regional rates of wall synthesis and degradation. secondly, the magnitude of the response depends on the extracellular ph, implicating anodal electrophoresis of membrane proteins in the mechanism. the ability of a field to modulate rates of wall growth locally can be exploited to investigate at least two fundamental, yet intractable, questions: the mechanism by which bacteria maintain non-spherical shapes and grow without bursting and the mechanism for the uniform segregation of dna into daughter cells. additionally, use of molecular biological techniques may permit identification of the molecular basis for galvanotropism, an approach that has not been feasible for most galvanotropic eukaryotic cells.

AB  == a nitroreductase enzyme has been isolated from escherichia coli b. this enzyme is an fmn-containing flavoprotein with a molecular mass of 24 kda and requires either nadh or nadph as a cofactor. partial protein sequence analysis showed extensive homology with the "classical nitroreductase" of salmonella typhimurium  and a nitroreductase induced in enterobacter cloacae. in common with the salmonella enzyme, the e. coli b enzyme is capable of reducing nitrofurazone. the e. coli nitroreductase is also capable of reducing the anti-tumour agent cb1954 [5-(aziridin-1-yl)-2,4-dinitrobenzamide], a property shared with the mammalian enzyme dt diaphorase [nad(p)h dehydrogenase (quinone)] as isolated from walker cells. the reduction of cb1954 by the e. coli enzyme results in the generation of cytotoxic species. both enzymes also share the properties of being able to reduce quinones and are both inhibited by dicoumarol. the nitroreductase is a more active enzyme against cb1954 (kcat = 360 min-1) than walker dt diaphorase (kcat = 4 min-1) and also has a lower km for nadh (6 vs 75 microm).

TI  == chromogenic redox assay for beta-lactamases yielding water-insoluble products. i. kinetic behavior and redox chemistry.
AB  == we describe a chromogenic detection system for beta-lactamase which yields water-insoluble colored products. the assay is based on kinetic measurement of the appearance of color due to the beta-lactamase-initiated redox reaction. the substrates are c3' thiolate-substituted cephalosporins, which, after enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring, undergo elimination of the thiolate ion. this thiolate, in a postenzymatic step, reduces the tetrazolium salts, which are water-soluble colorless compounds, to a colored water-insoluble  precipitate of formazan. our model in this study was a beta-lactamase enterobacter cloacae p-99-catalyzed reaction of thiolacetate cephalosporin with several tetrazolium salts. we found that the reaction rate is dependent on the concentration of the electron carrier 5-methyl phenazinium methyl sulfate, the pka of the c3' thiolate substituent of the cephalosporin substrate, and the reduction potential of the tetrazolium salts. a kinetic study of this system yielded a rate law for the reaction. we present a mechanism of the reaction and determination of the kinetic parameters for the process. the sensitivity of this  kinetic assay is very high; we detect 3 x 10(-10) m beta-lactamase p-99, which is approximately 30 miu. the assay times are very short, lasting from 2 to 5 min. the new assay system is particularly suitable for a rapid detection of beta-lactamases in bacterial colonies and in enzyme immunoassays where beta-lactamase may be used as the label.

AB  == beta-lactamase expression was examined in 1000 consecutive gram-negative bacilli  isolated from urine, wound swab, sputum or blood specimens received at the microbiology laboratory of the royal london hospital. this survey, performed between january and april, 1991, followed a similar study undertaken in early 1982. the distribution of species was similar in the two surveys, except that the proportion of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates had increased from 11% in 1982 to 17.5% in the present study. this increase was balanced by a decreased proportion  of enterobacteria. amongst plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, tem-1 (especially),  tem-2, shv-1 and oxa types continued to predominate in enterobacteria. their frequency in escherichia coli was unchanged (46% in 1991 compared with 43% in 1982), but had increased from 5 to 22% amongst proteus mirabilis isolates. an apparent decrease in their frequency amongst enterobacter cloacae isolates, from  48% in 1982 to 17% in 1991, probably reflected changes to strain prevalence rather than enzyme prevalence. plasmid type beta-lactamases were present in fewer than 2% of p. aeruginosa isolates in both surveys. in the present study, chromosomal beta-lactamase derepression (constitutive hyperproduction) was detected in 10/76 isolates of e. cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, serratia spp. and morganella morganii, and in 2/170 p. aeruginosa isolates. these proportions were increased, compared with those seen the 1982 survey, though the significance was borderline (p approximately 0.05; chi 2 test). extended-spectrum plasmid mediated beta-lactamases, unknown in 1982, were  found in 11/70 klebsiellae pneumoniae isolates in the present study. ten of these organisms, representing at least five distinct strains, produced tem-10 enzyme, encoded by a plasmid of c. 90 kb; the remaining organism had an unidentified shv-derived enzyme.

TI  == purification and characterization of indolepyruvate decarboxylase. a novel enzyme for indole-3-acetic acid biosynthesis in enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == indolepyruvate decarboxylase, a key enzyme for indole-3-acetic acid biosynthesis, was found in extracts of enterobacter cloacae. the enzyme catalyzes the decarboxylation of indole-3-pyruvic acid to yield indole-3-acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide. the enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity from escherichia  coli cells harboring the genetic locus for this enzyme obtained from e. cloacae.  the results of gel filtration experiments showed that indolepyruvate decarboxylase is a tetramer with an m(r) of 240,000. in the absence of thiamine pyrophosphate and mg2+, the active tetramers dissociate into inactive monomers and dimers. however, the addition of thiamine pyrophosphate and mg2+ to the inactive monomers and dimers results in the formation of active tetramers. these  results indicate that the thiamine pyrophosphate-mg2+ complex functions in the formation of the tetramer, which is the enzymatically active holoenzyme. the enzyme exhibited decarboxylase activity with indole-3-pyruvic acid and pyruvic acid as substrates, but no decarboxylase activity was apparent with l-tryptophan, indole-3-lactic acid, beta-phenylpyruvic acid, oxalic acid, oxaloacetic acid, and acetoacetic acid. the km values for indole-3-pyruvic acid and pyruvic acid were 15 microm and 2.5 mm, respectively. these results indicate that indole-3-acetic acid biosynthesis in e. cloacae is mediated by indolepyruvate decarboxylase, which has a high specificity and affinity for indole-3-pyruvic acid.

AB  == during the 20-year period, 1972-1991, 286 episodes of bacteremia occurred in 200  (45%) of 445 patients with acute leukemia in a hematology ward, giving an incidence of 482 episodes per 1,000 hospital admissions. the frequency of bacteremia was almost unchanged throughout the study period. the frequency of gram-negative bacilli decreased significantly, however, from 81% of all the isolates for the first half of the study period to 50% for the latter half. despite the common use of ceftazidime and imipenem during the last 5-year period, pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in frequency to be the most frequent organism. this was opposite to the decreased frequencies of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. the isolates of p. aeruginosa obtained during this period, all of which proved sensitive to ceftazidime and/or imipenem, were almost equally distributed among five serogroups, although a temporal preponderance of a limited number of serogroups was observed during the preceding 15-year period. on the other hand, the frequency of gram-positive cocci increased from 9% in the first decade to 35% in the latter decade. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus species and, to a lesser extent, staphylococcus aureus  were ranked as major pathogens. among the recent isolates of s. aureus, methicillin-resistant strains virtually replaced methicillin-sensitive ones. therefore, until more effective means for control of p. aeruginosa bacteremia in  particular become available, the occurrence of this infection will continue to limit the successful treatment of acute leukemia.

TI  == characterization of the plasmid mediated beta-lactamase bil-1.
AB  == a multi-resistant strain of escherichia coli isolated from a patient from pakistan was shown to possess a new plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase. this enzyme, designated bil-1, conferred resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins such as cefotaxime and ceftazidime. however, unlike other plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases capable of conferring resistance to these drugs, the bil-1 was not a member of the tem or shv group of plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and it also conferred resistance to beta-lactam drugs in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors (i.e. clavulanic acid). the biochemical properties of the enzyme suggest that bil-1 is related to the richmond & sykes class i chromosomal beta-lactamases. its inhibition properties by various beta-lactam drugs are similar to the inhibition properties of the chromosomally-encoded p99 enzyme of enterobacter cloacae.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activities of ticarcillin alone and ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid against beta-lactamase producing and non-producing microorganisms.
AB  == a total of 818 clinical bacterial isolates were tested for the production of beta-lactamase by rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method and for the susceptibility to ticarcillin alone and in combination with clavulanic acid (2 micrograms/ml) by agar dilution method. these included 83 strains of methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), 31 of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), 49 of neisseria gonorrhoeae, 58 of haemophilus influenzae, 112  of escherichia coli, 118 of klebsiella pneumoniae, 58 of proteus mirabilis, 30 of proteus vulgaris, 60 of serratia marcescens, 113 of enterobacter cloacae, 60 of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 46 of bacteroides fragilis. the results revealed that  46.6% of p. mirabilis, 53.4% of h. influenzae, 57.1% of n. gonorrhoeae, 80% of p. vulgaris, 83.9% of mrsa, 85.6% of mssa, 87.5% of e. coli, 91.7% of s. marcescens, 95.7% of b. fragilis, 98.2% of e. cloacae, and 100% of k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa strains produced beta-lactamase. in general, beta-lactamase nonproducers were more susceptible to ticarcillin than beta-lactamase producers.  the ranges of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ticarcillin for beta-lactamase nonproducers of mssa, mrsa, h. influenzae, e. coli, p. vulgaris, s. marcescens, e. cloacae, b. fragilis and beta-lactamase producers of mssa, h. influenzae strains were all within the in vitro susceptible range. the presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the antibacterial activity of ticarcillin against beta-lactamase producers of mrsa, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris and b. fragilis strains. clavulanic acid had no synergistic activity for ticarcillin against s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa and e. cloacae.

AB  == the epidemiological survey of aph (3') i and aph (3') ii genes, at a time when the specific antibiotic pressure was very low, was carried out by dna-dna hybridization. the sample included 334 aminoglycoside resistant gram-negative bacteria collected from patients of a general hospital. of these, 251 hybridized  with the aph (3') i-probe and 19 with the aph (3') ii-probe but only 190 strains  showed high resistance levels (cim greater than 64 micrograms/ml) for kanamycin,  neomycin and paromomycin. these strains were isolated both from inpatients and outpatients with different infectious diseases. the aph (3') i-gene was dispersed among all the bacterial species and clinical specimens tested but the aph (3') ii-gene was not found in pseudomonas spp, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii  and enterobacter cloacae, nor in infected catheters. several plasmids of different sizes carrying aph (3') genes were detected among different bacteria. plasmids along with transposable elements (the probes used in this work were developed from tn906 and tn5) and the high consumption of other antibiotics whose resistance is carried by these bacteria might be playing an important role in the maintenance and dispersion of aph (3') genes.

TI  == influence of transient salivary flora on assessment of mutans streptococci level  by the "strip mutans" method.
AB  == the dentocult sm ("strip mutans") method occasionally shows decoloration of broth and of colonies of mutans streptococci on the plastic strip, thereby making interpretation difficult. in an attempt to explain the phenomenon and to investigate the influence of the salivary flora on the "strip mutans" method, a total of 46 subjects were sampled. saliva was analyzed using the "strip mutans" method and conventional plating techniques to identify mutans streptococci, enterococci, staphylococci, enteric bacteria, and yeasts. approximately 85% of the "strip mutans" scores coincided with the conventional msb-plating method. two samples showed decolored mutans streptococci colonies on the "strip mutans" strip. enterococcus spp. were present in the saliva of these test subjects and could grow in the "strip mutans" broth. enterococcus faecalis was able to induce  the same type of decoloration under experimental pure culture conditions. three "strip mutans" samples showed small colonies of mutans streptococci, visible only under magnification (x 10-20). staphylococcus epidermidis was present in these saliva samples and showed heavy growth in the broth. under experimental pure culture conditions s. epidermidis also inhibited the growth of mutans streptococci to some extent.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new cephalosporin, compared with other cephalosporin antibiotics.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a c-3 bicyclic pyridinium group, was compared with ceftazidime, cefpirome, and cefepime. cefquinome inhibited members of the enterobacteriaceae at less than or  equal to 0.5 microgram/ml for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, salmonella shigella, proteus mirabilis, morganella, and providencia. although most citrobacter freundii and enterobacter  cloacae were inhibited by less than 2 micrograms/ml, some strains resistant to ceftazidime were resistant, [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) greater than  16 micrograms/ml]. serratia marcescens were inhibited by less than 1 microgram/ml and pseudomonas aeruginosa by 8 micrograms/ml similar to the activity of cefepime. the majority of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by less than 0.25 microgram/ml. most enterococci had cefquinome mics of 4-8 micrograms/ml. cefquinome was extremely active against group-a streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae with mics less than 0.12 microgram/ml. 90% of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus 90% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. overall, the in vitro activity of cefquinome was comparable with aminothiazolyl cephalosporins. it inhibited some enterobacter and citrobacter freundii resistant to ceftazidime as did cefpirome and cefepime. cefquinome was not destroyed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of klebsiella, branhamella, and pseudomonas, but  it was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-5, and tem-9. its activity was not adversely decreased in different medium or protein, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) for most species except for enterobacter were within a dilution of mics.

TI  == handwashing and disinfection of heavily contaminated hands--effective or ineffective?
AB  == hands are among the principal vehicles for transfer of nosocomial pathogens in hospitals. often, outbreaks of infection are thought to be caused by a lack of compliance with handwashing guidelines, rather than due to the inadequacy of the  handwashing agents used. in this study the effectiveness of proper handwashing and the use of three different hand disinfectants: ethanol 70% (e), isopropanol 40% (i) and alcoholic chlorhexidine (70%) (ac) was compared using three volunteers whose fingertips were heavily contaminated with a succession of bacteria including: enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae. after each contamination, thorough handwashing and application of one disinfectant on the hands were performed three times. fingerprint-samples were taken before and 1 min after application of the disinfectants. thorough handwashing with an ordinary liquid soap ('sterisol') did not reduce the confluent growth of bacteria on fingertips for any of the species  used (197 examinations). only ac had a significant effect on fingers heavily contaminated with s. aureus (126 examinations; ac compared with e and i; p less than 0.0002 and p less than 0.0002 respectively), but did not completely eradicate the bacteria. after contamination with ent. cloacae (118 examinations), none of the three agents were particularly effective, but e and ac seemed to be somewhat more effective than i (p less than 0.0002 and p less than 0.01 respectively). when successive contamination was performed using all bacterial species, ac was the most effective decontaminant. however, ent. cloacae was still present on the fingertips after 15 repeated courses of handwashing and applications of disinfectants. bathing of hands in ac for 20s completely eradicated all bacteria from the hands. the study demonstrates that, when heavily contaminated, an ordinary handwashing followed by disinfectants is not enough to  eradicate potentially pathogenic bacteria from the hands.

TI  == detergent-shock response in enteric bacteria.
AB  == our work on bacterial detergent resistance started with the realization that bacteria growing in a sink full of soap must be resistant to the detergents in that soap. we chose sodium dodecyl sulphate (sds) as a model detergent and decided to see how much sds the bacterium growing in the sink could tolerate. the research program thus initiated has shown that bacteria such as enterobacter cloacae can grow in up to 25% sds and that sds-shock proteins constitute c. 8% of the proteins synthesized by sds-grown escherichia coli. it has also provided explanations why enteric bacteria are oxidase negative, and how pyrroloquinoline  quinone (pqq) enters the periplasmic space. finally, for e. coli, it has provided evidence for an alternate, phosphate-limited, aquatic life style which places greater emphasis on the entner-doudoroff pathway. detergent resistance is important both medically and ecologically, e.g. entry of pathogens via bile-salt-containing intestinal tracts and biodegradation of detergent-like pollutants such as those resulting from oil spills. our current research is focused on sds-induced modifications of the cytoplasmic membrane and the presence of sds in the periplasm.

TI  == amino acid substitutions in naturally occurring variants of ail result in altered invasion activity.
AB  == yersinia enterocolitica is the causative agent of a variety of gastrointestinal syndromes ranging from acute enteritis to mesenteric lymphadenitis. in addition,  systemic infections resulting in high mortality rates can occur in elderly and immunocompromised patients. more than 50 serotypes of y. enterocolitica have been identified, but only a few of them commonly cause disease in otherwise healthy hosts. those serotypes that cause disease have been divided into two groups, american and non-american, based on their geographical distributions, biotypes, and pathogenicity. we have been studying two genes, inv and ail, from y. enterocolitica that confer in tissue culture assays an invasive phenotype that strongly correlates with virulence. some differences between the american and non-american serotypes at the ail locus were noted previously and have been investigated further in this report. the ail locus was cloned from seven y. enterocolitica strains (seven different serotypes). although the different clones produced similar amounts of ail, the product of the ail gene from non-american serotypes (ailna) was less able to promote invasion by escherichia coli than was  the product of the ail gene from american serotypes (aila). this difference is probably due to one or more of the eight amino acid changes found in the derived  amino acid sequence for the mature form of ailna compared with that of aila. seven of these changes are predicted to be in cell surface domains of the protein (a model for the proposed folding of ail within the outer membrane is presented). these results are discussed in relation to the growing family of outer membrane proteins, which includes lom from bacteriophage lambda, pagc from salmonella typhimurium, and ompx from enterobacter cloacae.

AB  == meropenem, a new broad-spectrum carbapenem antibiotic, demonstrated excellent in  vitro activity against major respiratory pathogens including moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae. minimal inhibitory concentrations of meropenem for moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus  influenzae isolates were frequently less than those of imipenem. for nosocomial amikacin-resistant gram-negative bacilli, meropenem had eightfold lower mic90 values compared to imipenem against strains of serratia marcescens, enterobacter  cloacae and escherichia coli; it was 32-fold more active than imipenem against proteus mirabilis isolates. activity was similar to that of imipenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. overall, meropenem showed excellent activity against common community-acquired pathogens as well as amikacin-resistant nosocomial pathogens.

TI  == fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry for bacterial chemotaxonomy: influence of culture age, growth temperature, gaseous environment and extraction technique.
AB  == extracted phospholipids of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and enterobacter cloacae were examined by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry which yielded major peaks between m/z 225 and 761. the result of extracting freeze-dried or 'wet' cells showed that freeze-drying may be omitted although weighing of dried cells offers a useful means of standardizing the extraction procedure. anaerobic  growth quantitatively altered the chemical finger-print as a result of increase in ratio of saturated: unsaturated carboxylic acids. growth temperature also affected profiles over the temperature range 24-45 degrees c. a less drastic influence on mass spectra was culture age, over the range 16-48 h. comparison of  spectra was possible with pearson's coefficient of linear correlation which yielded the following values: wet and lyophilized cells, r = 0.97; aerobic and anaerobic growth, r = 0.82; 24 degrees c and 45 degrees c, r = 0.76; 16 h and 48  h, r = 0.95. these results show that although quantitative differences do occur between spectra for the same organism prepared in different ways, they are less than interspecies variation, e.g. with e. coli and p. mirabilis, r = 0.46. any differences which are due preparation method can be overcome by standardization of technique.

TI  == [synergistic action of cefodizime with other antimicrobial agents on clinically isolated microorganisms. ii. synergistic action with sisomicin].
AB  == cefodizime (cdzm) possesses a broad antimicrobial spectrum and a relatively long  half life in the blood. in addition, it shows excellent therapeutic efficacies in the treatment of infections in leukopenic animal models, hence it is expected that cdzm may have good efficacies against various infections in immunocompromised hosts. in the meantime, sisomicin (siso) not only has strong antibacterial activities against gram-negative rods (gnr), but has relatively low nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. thus, we examined antibacterial effectiveness of  the combination of cdzm and siso against clinical isolates in vitro. 1. antibacterial effects of cdzm+siso combination were examined using siso susceptible strains of escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa. observations that the combination of the 2 drugs showed fic indices between less than 0.5-less than 1.0 against most of these strains at siso concentrations of 1 mic or sub mic levels strongly  suggested the presence of a synergistic action between the 2 drugs against siso susceptible strains of gnr. 2. of the strains tested, 10% of c. freundii, 6.7% of e. cloacae, 63.3% of s. marcescens, 23.3% of p. vulgaris and 18.0% of p. aeruginosa were found to be resistant to siso, and little synergistic effect of the 2 drugs was observed against these strains. 3. as the synergistic effect of the 2 drugs against gnr was observed against siso susceptible strains including those which were resistant to cdzm, but not against those strains which were resistant to siso, it seems reasonable to conclude that the appearance of the synergistic effect between the 2 drugs depends on the activity of siso.

TI  == urinary tract infection in infants in spite of prenatal diagnosis of hydronephrosis.
AB  == the efficacy of preventing neonatal urinary infection in infants by diagnosing hydronephrosis in the fetus on obstetrical ultrasonography was studied. 426 infants had uroradiologic evaluation between 1984 and june 1991 because they had  hydronephrosis detected in utero. thirteen with posterior urethral valves were excluded. of the remaining 413, 13 (3.1%) presented with urinary infection in the first 6 months of life. ten of the 13 were boys and 7 were not circumcised. eleven of the 13 infants less than 2 months old were formula-fed. the causes of hydronephrosis were reflux alone in 6, ureteropelvic junction obstruction in 6 (with coexisting ipsilateral reflux in 4), and primary megaureter in 1. ultrasonography alone was insufficient to exclude reflux. amoxicillin-resistant bacteria were the causative organisms in all 10 for whom bacteriology data was available. four categories of management failure were identified: 1) failure of communication of the prenatal findings, 2) antibiotics not prescribed, 3) antibiotics prescribed but not administered, and 4) infection in spite of continuous antibiotic prophylaxis. uncircumcised formula-fed male infants with reflux seemed to be at special risk for infection.

AB  == this study was aimed at recognition of frequency of occurrence of p fimbriae in strains of escherichia coli isolated from samples of feces of children with symptoms of diarrhoea and at search of these adhesions in strains representing other than escherichia genera of enterobacteriaceae strains. one hundred forty laboratory strains were investigated. they belonged to genus citrobacter, enterobacter, hafnia, klebsiella, morganella, proteus, providencia, salmonella, shigella, and yersinia. also were tested 1277 colonies of enteric rods isolated from the macconkey's medium inoculated with samples of feces from 163 children with symptoms of diarrhoea. mannose-resistant active hemagglutination test was performed with human group o erythrocytes and guinea pig erythrocytes stabilized  with glutaraldehyde. presence of p fimbriae was detected by the slide latex test  with latex covered by p1 glycoprotein. among 140 laboratory strains of enterobacteriaceae in 21 strains (3-e. cloaceae, 2-hafnia, 13-k. pneumoniae, 2-p. rettgeri and in one strains of providencia) presence of mrha adhesins was demonstrated. nine of these strains (2-hafnia, 5-k. pneumoniae and 2-p. rettgeri) reacted specifically in the latex test. among 1142 colonies of e. coli isolated from children with symptoms of diarrhoea, 326 colonies belonged to 13 epec serotypes. with 118 (36.2%) of epec colonies a positive result of mrha reaction was found with human erythrocytes and 34 (10.4%) with guinea pig erythrocytes. positive latex test was obtained with 77 (23.6%) colonies. all these colonies possessed mrha adhesins. remaining 816 colonies of e. coli strains did not represent microorganisms belonging to serotypes accepted as enteropathogenic. from 112 (13.7%) colonies out of 816 not belonging to epec, positive results was  obtained in the mrha test with human erythrocytes and this was the case also with 41 (5.0%) colonies in mrha reaction with application of guinea pig erythrocytes.  the latex test was positive in 65 (7.9%) colonies of e. coli. from remaining 135  colonies other than e. coli, positive result of latex test of presence of p fimbriae was obtained with 54 (40.0%) colonies, including 14 colonies of e. cloacae, 23-k. pneumoniae and 17-k. oxytoca. in all these strains presence of mrha adhesins was demonstrated. these investigations demonstrated that among epec strains significantly more frequently, than not belonging to these serotypes of e. coli, mrha adhesins, including p fimbriae was observed.(abstract truncated at  400 words)

TI  == retrospective 6-year study of enterobacter bacteraemia in a danish university hospital.
AB  == in order to study the epidemiology of invasive enterobacter infections, data from 53 consecutive cases of bacteraemia due to this organism were compared with data  from 72 randomly selected cases of escherichia coli bacteraemia. the cases occurred among patients admitted to a danish university hospital over a 6-year period. forty-eight cases were due to enterobacter cloacae and five were due to ent. aerogenes. enterobacter bacteraemia was more often of nosocomial origin than e. coli bacteraemia and more often polymicrobial. patients suffering from enterobacter bacteraemia were younger than e. coli patients, and males tended to  predominate. apart from cancer of the prostate, other malignant diseases tended to be more frequent among patients with enterobacter bacteraemia than among e. coli patients. enterobacter bacteraemia was more often associated with a focus in central venous catheters and burns, whereas patients with e. coli bacteraemia more often showed a focus of infection in the urinary tract. patients with enterobacter bacteraemia and a microbiologically documented focus in the respiratory tract or the urinary tract more often had an endotracheal tube or indwelling urinary catheter compared to patients with e. coli bacteraemia with a  similar focus of infection. in patients with no microbiologically documented focus enterobacter bacteraemia was more often associated with the presence of central and peripheral venous catheters. during the preceding 12 weeks patients with enterobacter bacteraemia, more often than e. coli patients, had been treated with beta-lactam antibiotics, especially penicillins. the close association with  devices may indicate that enterobacter has a special affinity for foreign body material. studies are planned to elucidate this aspect in further detail.

TI  == detection of ciprofloxacin resistance in gram-negative bacteria due to alterations in gyra.
AB  == two plasmids containing the cloned escherichia coli wild-type gyra gene were used to transform ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative clinical isolates to screen for dna gyrase a-mediated quinolone resistance. the results show that the technique is simple and applicable to a wide range of gram-negative species including e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella aerogenes, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni and neisseria gonorrhoeae. the use of an arithmetical mic series of dilutions (as opposed to standard geometrical ones) was found to be essential during screening  for the detection of altered gyrase a. the observations were consistent with the  suggestion that dna gyrase is highly conserved among different species of bacteria and that gyrase a-mediated resistance can occur in all.

TI  == drug treatment of pneumonia in the hospital. what are the choices?
AB  == mortality and morbidity of nosocomial pneumonia remain high. successful treatment of pulmonary infections depends on several factors including type of infection, offending pathogen, status of host defences, and adequate choice of antibiotic therapy. the physician's decision should aim at achieving antibiotic concentrations beyond the mic at the site of infection. gram-negative bacilli, notably pseudomonos aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli, remain the most frequent agents in nosocomial pneumonia. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae predominate among the gram-positive cocci. pneumocystis carinii predominates in immunocompromised patients. protected sample bronchoscopy associated with quantitative cultures of samples, and quantification of intracellular microorganisms in cells recovered by broncho-alveolar lavage are two promising procedures which might replace previous, more aggressive methods. penetration of antibiotics into lung tissue depends on physicochemical properties of the drug and the degree of inflammation of lung tissue. quinolones, macrolides, tetracyclines and trimethoprim penetrate well into bronchial secretions. penetration is moderate to low for aminoglycosides and beta-lactams.  fluoroquinolones and new beta-lactam agents, including third-generation cephalosporins imipenem, aztreonam and ticarcillin-clavulanate, showed comparative clinical efficacy in treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, with an efficacy rate close to 80%. aminoglycosides should not be used alone. combination therapy reduces but does not eliminate the risk of selection of gram-negative resistant mutants. it should not be used routinely except for p. aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens infections.

TI  == multiple copies of is10 in the enterobacter cloacae md36 chromosome.
AB  == repetitive sequences were isolated and characterized as double-stranded dna fragments by treatment with s1 nuclease after denaturation and renaturation of the total dna of enterobacter cloacae md36. one repetitive sequence was identical to the nucleotide sequence of is10-right (is10r), which is the active element in  the plasmid-associated transposon tn10. unexpectedly, 15 copies of is10r were found in the chromosomal dna of e. cloacae md36. one copy of the central region of tn10 was found in the total dna of e. cloacae md36. is10rs in restriction fragments isolated from the e. cloacae md36 total dna showed 9-bp duplications adjacent to the terminal sequences that are characteristic of tn10 transposition. this result suggests that many copies of is10r in e. cloacae md36 are due to transposition of is10r alone, not due to transposition of tn10 or to dna rearrangement. i also found nine copies of is10 in shigella sonnei hh109, two and four copies in two different natural isolates of escherichia coli, and two copies in e. coli k-12 strain jm109 from the 60 bacterial strains that were examined. all dam sites in the is10s in e. cloacae md36 and s. sonnei hh109 were methylated. tn10 and is10 transpose by a mechanism in which the element is excised from the donor site and inserted into the new target site without significant replication of the transposing segment; thus, the copy numbers of the elements in the cell are thought to be unchanged in most circumstances. accumulation of is10 copies in e. cloacae md36 has interesting evolutionary implications.

TI  == active components of intestinal bacteria for abdominal irradiation-induced inhibition of lung metastases.
AB  == we have previously reported that abdominal irradiation of mice inhibited lung metastases of a weakly immunogenic fibrosarcoma, and that transmigration after the irradiation of enterobacter cloacae into mesenteric lymph nodes coincided with this phenomenon. in this paper, we show that escherichia coli as well as e.  cloacae reduce the number of metastatic lung colonies when these bacteria were intravenously injected into mice prior to the tumour cell challenge. the inhibition was caused not only by the administration of living bacteria but also  by that of killed bacteria. bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps), a component of membrane, replaced at least in part the effect of whole bacteria. transfer of spleen cells from lps-treated mice into intact recipients prominently inhibited metastatic development in the recipient mice. 'cross transfer' between lps high responders and lps low responders suggested an indirect activity of transferred spleen cells. the antimetastatic activity of lps depended on the tumour cell type; metastasis of fibrosarcomas was extensively inhibited by lps irrespective of tumour immunogenicity while that of adenocarcinomas was only slightly inhibited. these results suggest that non-immunological mechanisms are involved in the antimetastatic activity of lps.

AB  == bacterial attachment is believed to be an early step in gram-negative nosocomial  pneumonia. the frequency of fimbria-associated adhesins among respiratory pathogens has not been studied in detail. in this study isolates belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae, prospectively obtained from intensive care unit patients who were suspected of having nosocomial pneumonia, were examined for fimbria-associated adhesins. type 3, p, type 1, and other fimbrial phenotypes were identified by specific hemagglutination and electron microscopy. the klebsiella type 3 fimbrial phenotype was further characterized by using a monoclonal antibody. also, both type 3 and escherichia coli p fimbrial genotypes  were detected by using dna colony blot assays. the frequencies of genera or species isolated were as follows: enterobacter (38.6%), klebsiella (26.8%), serratia (17.7%), e. coli (13%), and proteus (5.2%). isolates of klebsiella oxytoca, k. pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae most commonly possessed the type 3 fimbrial phenotype and genotype. the phenotype and genotype for e. coli p fimbriae (46.2 and 50%, respectively), a known pathogenic determinant in the urinary tract, were detected more frequently than expected. in addition, a previously unspecified hemagglutinin that was specific for porcine erythrocytes was almost uniformly expressed among isolates of enterobacter aerogenes. finally, the expression of the type 1 fimbrial phenotype was widely detected among the isolates tested but notably absent among k. oxytoca and proteus mirabilis isolates. the frequency of the various fimbrial types identified suggests a role  for these bacterial organelles in adherence to respiratory epithelia.

AB  == amoxicillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic, was tested for its effect in combination with clavulanic acid, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, against 9 species of bacteria isolated from clinical specimens. a total of 698 strains of bacteria were tested  for beta-lactamase production by the rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method. their susceptibilities to amoxicillin alone and in combination with clavulanic acid were tested by the agar dilution method. the percentage of beta-lactamase producing strains ranged from 46.6% in proteus mirabilis to 100% in klebsiella pneumoniac. in general, beta-lactamase nonproducers were more susceptible to amoxicillin than beta-lactamase producers. for beta-lactamase producers, clavulanic acid decreased the mics of amoxicillin prominently in strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae and bacteroides fragilis, when combining clavulanic acid with amoxicillin in the ratio of 1:2. their mic50s, mic90s and geometric means of mics all decreased 4 folds or greater. for beta-lactamase non-producing strains, the mics did not show significant differences by adding clavulanic acid in most species we tested, including methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, n. gonorrhoeae, h. influenzae, proteus vulgaris and e. cloacae.

TI  == growth kinetics of coliform bacteria under conditions relevant to drinking water  distribution systems.
AB  == the growth of environmental and clinical coliform bacteria under conditions typical of drinking water distribution systems was examined. four coliforms (klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae) were isolated from an operating drinking water system for study; an enterotoxigenic e. coli strain and clinical isolates of k. pneumoniae and e. coli were also used. all but one of the coliforms tested were capable of growth in unsupplemented mineral salts medium; the environmental isolates had greater specific growth rates than did the clinical isolates. this trend was maintained when the organisms were grown with low levels (less than 1 mg liter-1) of yeast extract. the environmental k. pneumoniae isolate had a greater yield, higher specific growth rates, and a lower ks value than the other organisms. the  environmental e. coli and the enterotoxigenic e. coli strains had comparable yield, growth rate, and ks values to those of the environmental k. pneumoniae strain, and all three showed significantly more successful growth than the clinical isolates. the environmental coliforms also grew well at low temperatures on low concentrations of yeast extract. unsupplemented distribution water from the collaborating utility supported the growth of the environmental isolates. growth of the k. pneumoniae water isolate was stimulated by the addition of autoclaved biofilm but not by tubercle material. these findings indicate that growth of environmental coliforms is possible under the conditions found in operating municipal drinking water systems and that these bacteria could be used  in tests to determine assimilable organic carbon in potable water.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefcanel versus other oral cephalosporins.
AB  == cefcanel is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. its activity was compared with that of cefuroxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, and cefixime against gram-positive and  negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. cefcanel had excellent activity against  methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, mic90 1 micrograms/ml, superior to the other oral cephalosporins. however, methicillin-resistant staphylococci were resistant, mic greater than or equal to  16 micrograms/ml. streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.015-1 micrograms/ml, concentrations comparable to other cephalosporins. clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.25 micrograms/ml, 8- to 128-fold lower concentrations than were found for other agents, but the mics were greater than 64 micrograms/ml for bacteroides spp. the mic90 for moraxella catarrhalis was 1 micrograms/ml, similar to cefuroxime but 16-fold greater than the mics of cefixime. escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumonia which were high beta-lactamase producers were resistant, mics greater than 64 micrograms/ml, and  50% of enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii were resistant. cefcanel was hydrolyzed by tem-1, tem-3 and moraxella bro-1 beta-lactamases. escherichia coli  containing tem-1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 had cefcanel mics of greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. although cefcanel inhibited gram-positive species as well as or at lower concentrations than other cephalosporins, it lacked activity against gram-negative species that produced common plasmid beta-lactamase although it inhibited haemophilus influenzae carrying tem-1.

TI  == phenotypic characterization of quinolone-resistant mutants of enterobacteriaceae  selected from wild type, gyra type and multiply-resistant (mara) type strains.
AB  == the nctc type strains of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens and klebsiella pneumoniae were exposed to 3, 5 and 10 x mic of nalidixic acid, enoxacin, ciprofloxacin, pd 117596 and pd 127391. from each strain a mutant with a high mic of quinolones alone (gyra) and a mutant with intermediate resistance to quinolones, some beta-lactams, chloramphenicol and tetracycline (multiply resistant, m-r) were selected on agar containing antibiotics. the gyra mutants required a higher concentration of quinolone to inhibit dna synthesis by 50% but quinolone uptake kinetics and outer membrane profile were the same as the wild type. the m-r mutants had similar dna synthesis ic50 as the wild type, decreased quinolone uptake kinetics and had decreased expression of an omp of approximately 40 kd. the gyra and m-r mutants were then exposed to 3, 5 and 10 x mic of the same quinolones and new mutants (f2) selected. the f2 mutants from the gyra mutants displayed a further increase in quinolone mic; the f2 mutants from the m-r mutants had several phenotypes: high quinolone mics with cross resistance to other agents, high quinolone resistance alone, or intermediate quinolone resistance alone. most f2 mutants had mics above the recommended breakpoint concentrations for quinolones. the f2 mutants often had altered biochemical profiles (api 20e), however, only in the case of e. cloacae did this affect speciation with the strains being identified as rhanella  aquatalis.

TI  == comparison of ribotyping with conventional methods for the type identification of enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == an escherichia coli rrna probe was compared with a combination of o serotyping, phage susceptibility, and biotype pattern for the type identification of strains  of enterobacter cloacae. forty-five isolates of e. cloacae from 36 patients in nine hospitals were examined. by conventional typing, only 26 (57.7%) could be assigned to a specific serotype and 6 (13.3%) were autoagglutinating owing to rough lipopolysaccharide antigens. all isolates could be assigned to one of three biotypes, but many phage sensitivity patterns were evident. twenty-nine distinct  strains were identified by combined typing. probing of ecori and bamhi digests of chromosomal dna with a cdna copy of e. coli rrna proved to be highly discriminating between strains. thirty different ribotypes based on 28 bands were recorded. overall, agreement between the ribotyping and combined typing methods was good (84.4%), and discrepancies were generally confined to serologically unclassifiable strains and variability in biotype codes. ribotyping was reproducible, and five of six pairs of isolates from the same and different patients gave identical hybridization profiles on separate occasions. we conclude that ribotyping is a highly discriminatory and reproducible method for the typing of e. cloacae, but in most outbreaks it offers little increase in discrimination  over traditional methods.

TI  == factors affecting duration of in-vivo postantibiotic effect for aminoglycosides against gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == a murine thigh-infection model was used to determine the effect of certain host-  and drug-related factors on the duration of the in-vivo postantibiotic effect (pae) observed with aminoglycosides against gram-negative bacilli. the role of neutrophils (pmns), pharmacokinetics and variation among species and strains were studied. paes were quantitated after a single injection of gentamicin or amikacin. paes were several hours longer in normal mice than in neutropenic mice, in mice with renal impairment than in those with normal renal function, and with  strains of klebsiella pneumoniae than with strains of escherichia coli, serratia  marcescens and enterobacter cloacae. among the 15 strains of enterobacteriaceae studied, the duration of the in-vivo pae did not correlate with mic, duration of  in-vitro pae, and extent of in-vivo bactericidal activity. we conclude that prolonged paes are consistently observed in vivo with aminoglycosides against enterobacteriaceae, and that this duration is enhanced in the presence of pmns and by pharmacokinetic properties simulating those observed in humans.

TI  == molecular cloning of the gene for indolepyruvate decarboxylase from enterobacter  cloacae.
AB  == although indole-3-acetic acid (iaa) is a well-known plant hormone, the main iaa biosynthetic pathway from l-tryptophan (trp) via indole-3-pyruvic acid (ipya) has yet to be elucidated. previous studies have suggested that iaa is produced by enterobacter cloacae isolated from the rhizosphere of cucumbers and its biosynthetic pathway may possibly be the same as that in plants. to elucidate this pathway, the iaa biosynthetic gene was isolated from a genomic library of e. cloacae by assaying for the ability to convert trp to iaa. dna sequence analysis  showed that this gene codes for only one enzyme and its predicted protein sequence has extensive homology with pyruvate decarboxylase in yeast and zymomonas mobilis. cell-free extracts prepared from escherichia coli harboring this gene could convert ipya to indole-3-acetaldehyde (iaald). these results clearly show that this pathway is mediated only by indolepyruvate decarboxylase,  which catalyzes the conversion of ipya to iaald.

AB  == a study was done to determine the genetic locus responsible for altered expression of ampc beta-lactamase in enterobacter cloacae 1194e and several mutants derived from e. cloacae 029. these phenotypes were defined by units of enzyme activity found in sonic extracts of cells before and after induction with  cefoxitin and included (units uninduced/units induced) the wild-type (7/219), high-level constitutive (10,911/10,862), temperature-sensitive (at 30 degrees c 82/706 and at 42 degrees c 5,031/6,020), and hyperinducible (19/1,688) phenotypes. when the ampd region of each e. cloacae strain was cloned and introduced into an ampd mutant escherichia coli strain, the altered phenotypes were found to reside within this locus. furthermore, transformants containing wild-type ampd were poorly inducible at 42 degrees c while those with high-level  constitutive or hyperinducible ampd were unaffected by temperature. since the source of ampd was the only variable in these e. coli transformants, these results suggested that ampd encodes a protein that is involved in sensing the inducer. to test this possibility, the responses to different inducers of e. coli transformants containing various ampd regions were assessed. in the presence of wild-type ampd, transformants responded equally to cefoxitin and cefotetan, regardless of temperature. in the presence of temperature-sensitive ampd, induction by cefotetan was similar to that by cefoxitin at 30 degrees c but greater than that by cefoxitin at 42 degrees c. these results suggest that ampd encodes a protein involved in induction of ampc beta-lactamase in e. cloacae.

AB  == we have used triparental matings to demonstrate transfer (mobilization) of the nonconjugative genetically engineered plasmid phsv106, which contains the thymidine kinase gene of herpes simplex virus cloned into pbr322, from escherichia coli hb101 to an environmental isolate of enterobacter cloacae in sterile drinking water. this is the first demonstration of a two-step mobilization of a genetically engineered plasmid in any type of fresh water, including drinking water. transfer was mediated by r plasmid r100-1 of e. coli ed2149(r100-1). matings in drinking water at 15, 25, and 35 degrees c yielded recombinants, the number of which increased with increasing temperature. numbers  of recombinants obtained were 2 orders of magnitude lower than those obtained from matings in trypticase soy broth. high concentrations of parental organisms (2.6 x 10(8) to 2.0 x 10(9) cfu/ml) were required. during 1 week of incubation in drinking water, number of parental organisms and recombinants resulting from mobilization remained constant in the absence of indigenous organisms and declined in their presence. using oligonucleotide probes for the cloned foreign dna (thymidine kinase gene) and plasmid vector dna (ampicillin resistance gene),  we demonstrated that both genes were transferred to e. cloacae in the mobilization process. in one recombinant selected for detailed study, the plasmids containing these genes differed in size from all forms of phsv106 present in e. coli hb101(phsv106), indicating that dna rearrangement had occurred. this recombinant maintained its plasmids in unchanged form for 15 days  in drinking water. a second rearrangement occurred during serial passage of this  recombinant on selective media.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == intravenous ciprofloxacin versus ceftazidime for treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection.
AB  == intravenous ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were compared for efficacy in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection (uti). patients with nosocomial pneumonia were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin (as the lactate salt) 300 mg i.v. every 12 hours or ceftazidime (with sodium carbonate) 2 g i.v. every eight hours. patients with uti were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin 200 mg i.v. every 12 hours or ceftazidime 1 g i.v. every eight hours. sputum and urine specimens were collected before, during, and after therapy. for patients with pneumonia, the organisms most frequently isolated before treatment began were escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis. of the 17 pneumonia patients who completed ciprofloxacin treatment, 15 (88%) had resolution of signs and symptoms or improvement. of the 15 ceftazidime-treated pneumonia patients, 13 (87%) had resolution or improvement. staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus species, acinetobacter species, and k. pneumoniae infections persisted for the ciprofloxacin treatment failures. infections by enterobacter cloacae and acinetobacter species persisted for the ceftazidime treatment failures. for uti patients, e. coli was the organism most frequently isolated before treatment. all 14 uti patients who completed treatment showed resolution or improvement. in the  ciprofloxacin group two patients were superinfected by enterococcus species, and  in the ceftazidime group there were two superinfections by enterococcus species and one by enterobacter cloacae. intravenous ciprofloxacin was as effective as ceftazidime in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection. caution should be exercised when treating serious infections by streptococci or staphylococci.

TI  == production and characterization of a monoclonal antibody specific for enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli of serotypes o157:h7 and o26:h11.
AB  == a monoclonal antibody (mab 4e8c12) specific for escherichia coli o157:h7 and o26:h11 was produced by immunizing balb/c mice with a rough strain of e. coli o157:h7. the antibody reacted strongly by a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with each of 36 strains of e. coli o157:h7. no cross-reactivity was observed with strains of salmonella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, shigella dysenteriae, proteus spp., escherichia hermanii, klebsiella pneumoniae, campylobacter jejuni, serratia marcescens, citrobacter spp., enterobacter cloacae, hafnia alvei, aeromonas hydrophila, and all except five strains of e. coli other than serotype o157:h7 (including strains of serotype o157 but not h7). the e. coli strains (all of serotype o26:h11) that reacted with the antibody were enterohemorrhagic e. coli (ehec) that were isolated from patients with hemolytic  uremic syndrome or hemorrhagic colitis and produced verotoxin similar to that of  e. coli o157:h7. mab 4e8c12 belongs to the subclass immunoglobulin g2a and has a  kappa light chain. tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of outer membrane proteins of e. coli of different serotypes followed by western immunoblot analysis revealed that mab 4e8c12 reacted specifically with two proteins of ehec strains of serotypes o157:h7 and o26:h11 with apparent molecular weights of 5,000 to 6,000. these proteins appeared to be  markers specific for ehec strains of serotypes o157:h7 and o26:h11. this mab, because of its specificity, may be a useful reagent of an immunoassay for the rapid detection of these types of ehec isolates in clinical and food specimens.

TI  == molecular characterization of an enterobacter cloacae outer membrane protein (ompx).
AB  == a chromosomal gene of enterobacter cloacae encoding an outer membrane protein (ompx) has been cloned. overproduction of the ompx protein decreased the quantity of porins in the outer membrane of the parental strain and of escherichia coli hb101. the ompx gene was located by insertions of the gamma delta sequence into the recombinant plasmid. the polarity of the gene was determined by in vitro transcription and translation of the gamma delta-containing plasmids. the nucleotide sequence of the ompx gene was elucidated by using both inverted terminal repeats of the gamma delta sequence as starting points for m13 dideoxy sequencing. the gene was found to encode a precursor of the ompx protein consisting of 172 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 18.6 kda. the protein contains an n-terminal signal sequence of 23 amino acid residues. the exact cleavage point was established by sequencing the n-terminal part of the mature protein. the ompx protein has several characteristics in common with outer membrane proteins of gram-negative bacteria. the protein is rather hydrophilic and is devoid of long hydrophobic stretches. on the basis of these results, we present a model for the ompx protein folding in an outer membrane.

AB  == we determined the effect of the combination of rifampin and fleroxacin against enterobacteriaceae and streptococcal species. none of the 65 isolates tested by checkerboard assay demonstrated synergy, 12% of isolates showed an additive effect; 86.7% were indifferent, and only 1 isolate showed antagonism. the mean fic was 1.2. when using 2 and 8 micrograms/ml of rifampin, fleroxacin mics of 285 isolates of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococci, streptococci, bacteroides, and clostridium were not increased, but synergy was not demonstrated. time-kill studies against escherichia coli, p. aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis failed to show increased killing when the two agents were present at one-half the mbc. the fleroxacin-rifampin interaction is one of indifference but  provides coverage for species not adequately inhibited by fleroxacin.

TI  == induction of immunity by latex beads and by hemolymph transfer in galleria mellonella.
AB  == injection of sterile latex beads into the hemocoel of last instar larvae of galleria mellonella provoked a strong defense reaction. cellular defense by hemocytes was followed by enhanced antibacterial activity in hemolymph. latex-injected insects showed increased survival rates after a challenge injection with high doses of bacteria. factors which stimulate the production of  antibacterial activity could be demonstrated soon after injection by transfer of  hemolymph from preinjected to untreated larvae. a large induction capacity in donor hemolymph was accompanied by a strong decrease in the total hemocyte count  of free floating hemocytes, resulting from a decrease in number of plasmatocytes  and granular cells, the cell types involved in the cellular defense against the injected latex beads. the results presented support the hypothesis that during cellular defense reactions, factors are released from the hemocytes which stimulate the production of antibacterial substances.

TI  == biological characterization of an enterobacter cloacae outer membrane protein (ompx).
AB  == we have described a gene coding for an enterobacter cloacae protein, provisionally called ompx (j. stoorvogel, m. j. a. w. m. van bussel, j. tommassen, and j. a. m. van de klundert, j. bacteriol. 173:156-160, 1991). in the work reported here, ompx was localized in the cell envelope by means of sucrose gradient fractionation of membrane vesicles. overproduction of ompx in escherichia coli from a multicopy plasmid resulted in a reduction in the amount of ompf. no accumulation of ompf, of its uncleft precursor, or of its degradation products could be detected in various cell fractions by western immunoblot analysis using monoclonal antibodies produced in response to ompf. a decrease in  the rate of synthesis of ompf mrna was indicated by a beta-galactosidase assay in an ompf-lacz fusion strain containing the cloned ompx gene and by northern (rna)  blot analysis. these results indicate that the inhibition is at the level of transcription. colony hybridization, using an internal ompx fragment as a probe,  showed a widespread distribution of the ompx gene among clinical isolates of members of the family enterobacteriaceae. to study the function of the ompx protein and its role in the regulation of porin protein synthesis, the ompx gene  was deleted from the enterobacter cloacae chromosome and replaced by the apha gene. the absence of the ompx gene had no apparent effect on cell growth or on the regulation of the porin proteins.

TI  == in vitro effect of chlorhexidine and amikacin on oral gram-negative bacilli from  bone marrow transplant recipients.
AB  == prophylactic use of chlorhexidine (chx) mouthrinses has been shown to benefit the oral health status of bone marrow transplant recipients and other immunosuppressed persons and to reduce systemic complications of oral origin. however, a problem that often emerges with these patients is oropharyngeal and lower respiratory tract colonization by opportunistic aerobic or facultative gram-negative bacilli (gnb). trends in four studies indicated that chx rinses may predispose these persons to oral colonization by gnb such as the enterobacteria,  klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. since gnb are generally susceptible to broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotics such as amikacin, the in vitro sensitivities of k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli atcc reference strains and k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae oral clinical isolates to combinations of chx and amikacin were determined by means of a disk diffusion sensitivity assay on mueller-hinton agar. the amikacin minimum inhibitory concentrations for all gnb tested were much lower (less than or equal  to 4.69 to less than or equal to 9.37 micrograms/ml) than those for chx (less than or equal to 18.75 to less than or equal to 300 micrograms/ml), and combinations of chx and amikacin gave larger growth inhibition zones than chx alone. no antibacterial antagonism between chx and amikacin was found, and their  solubilities were compatible. therefore use of topical amikacin in conjunction with chx rinses may reduce oral colonization by gnb in severely immunocompromised patient populations.

AB  == febrile neutropenic patients were randomized to receive ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin with the addition of teicoplanin in cases with clinical suspicion of a hickman line-associated infection. at 48 h both clinical and bacteriological analyses were made. patients were categorized as: success, in cases of improvement or stability in the clinical condition; failure, if there was a deterioration of the clinical condition; and non-evaluable, in cases of protocol  violation or death due to other causes. a total of 86 patients have completed the study so far; 43 patients were randomized to the ceftazidime and 43 to the ciprofloxacin group. teicoplanin was added to the monotherapy in 12 patients in the ceftazidime group and 15 in the ciprofloxacin group. the diagnoses were: acute myelogenous leukaemia (25), non-hodgkin's lymphoma (34), hodgkin's disease  (17); acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (9) and chronic granulocytic leukaemia (1). forty-eight hour clinical assessment showed a response rate in the ceftazidime group of: success 18/31 (58%), failure 13/31 (42%); in the ceftazidime and teicoplanin group: success 8/12 (67%), failure 4/12 (33%); in the ciprofloxacin group: success 23/28 (82%), failure 5/28 (18%); and in the ciprofloxacin and teicoplanin group: success 11/15 (73%), failure 4/15 (27%). blood cultures were positive in 48/86 (56%) cases, with more than one organism isolated in seven of these 48 cases. organisms isolated were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (20), escherichia coli (13), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), staphylococcus aureus (3), diphtheroids (3), klebsiella sp. (3), enterobacter cloacae (2), streptococcus faecalis (2), ent. adenocarboxylata (1), clostridium septicum (1). strept. b (1), alpha streptococcus (1) and p. fluorescens (1), in-vitro testing showed that all  gram-positive organisms were sensitive to teicoplanin, and gram-negative organisms to ciprofloxacin or ceftazidime. there were seven cases of superimposed infections with eight organisms isolated, all cases occurring in patients receiving ciprofloxacin alone: coagulase-negative staphylococci (4), strep. sangius (1), strep. viridans (1), diphtheroids (1) and p. maltophilia (1). both ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime are comparable in efficacy as empirical monotherapy for febrile neutropenic patients. there is, however, a significant increase in the incidence of superimposed infection in patients receiving only ciprofloxacin. in view of the very high incidence of gram-positive septicaemia, we suggest that  teicoplanin should be added as part of the initial empiric antibiotic regimen in  all febrile neutropenic patients.

AB  == we reviewed cases of gram-negative enteric bacillary meningitis in infants and children treated with cefotaxime at texas children's hospital from january, 1984, through june, 1989. seventeen of 20 children had an underlying condition predisposing to the development of meningitis. the etiologic organisms in these 20 children (2 days to 12 years old; median, 12 days old) were klebsiella sp, 9;  escherichia coli, 4; enterobacter cloacae, 3; citrobacter diversus, 2; other, 2.  with the exception of one isolate of acinetobacter, all isolates were susceptible to cefotaxime. in addition to cefotaxime 17 children received an aminoglycoside intravenously. children with meningitis caused by klebsiella sp. or non-klebsiella organisms received cefotaxime for 31 +/- 14 and 37 +/- 17 days, respectively. aminoglycosides were administered for 16 +/- 10 days in both groups. five children in each group also received intraventricular doses (1 to 25) of an aminoglycoside (9) or colistimethate (1). the mean durations of positive lumbar, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid or brain abscess cultures were 5.8 +/- 4.7 and 7.2 +/- 5.0 days after start of therapy in the klebsiella and non-klebsiella meningitis patients, respectively. only three children were normal at the time of discharge or follow-up. gram-negative enteric meningitis remains difficult to treat despite the excellent in vitro activity of cefotaxime against  gram-negative enterics, in part as a result of the predisposing conditions resulting in the development of this infection.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of cefodizime: a review.
AB  == for enterobacteriaceae, mic50s and mic90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: escherichia  coli 0.12 and 0.5, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, serratia  marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. the activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. haemophilus spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as n. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic50s and mic90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic50 and mic90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were generally resistant: streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (mic50 and mic90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium perfringens (mic50 and mic90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). these results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.

TI  == novel plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase (mir-1) conferring resistance to oxyimino-  and alpha-methoxy beta-lactams in clinical isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from 11 patients at the miriam hospital were identified as resistant to cefoxitin and ceftibuten as well as to aztreonam, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime. resistance could be transferred by conjugation or transformation with plasmid dna into escherichia coli and was due to the production of a beta-lactamase with an isoelectric point of 8.4 named mir-1. in e. coli, mir-1 conferred resistance to aztreonam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftibuten, ceftriaxone, and such alpha-methoxy beta-lactams as cefmetazole, cefotetan, cefoxitin, and moxalactam. in vitro, mir-1 hydrolyzed cephalothin and  cephaloridine much more rapidly than it did penicillin g, ampicillin, or carbenicillin. cefotaxime was hydrolyzed at 10% the rate of cephaloridine. cefoxitin inactivation could only be detected by a microbiological test. the inhibition profile of mir-1 was similar to that of chromosomally mediated class i beta-lactamases. potassium clavulanate had little effect on cefoxitin or cefibuten resistance and was a poor inhibitor of mir-1 activity. cefoxitin or imipenem did not induce mir-1. the gene determining mir-1 was cloned on a 1.4-kb  acci-psti fragment. under stringent conditions, probes for tem-1 and shv-1 genes  and the e. coli ampc gene failed to hybridize with the mir-1 gene. however, a provisional sequence of 150 bp of the mir-1 gene proved to be 90% identical to the sequence of ampc from enterobacter cloacae but only 71% identical to that of  e. coli, thus explaining the lack of hybridization to the e. coli ampc probe. plasmid profiles of the 11 k. pneumoniae clinical isolates were not identical, but each contained a plasmid from 40 to 60 kb that hybridized with the cloned mir-1 gene. both transfer-proficient and transfer-deficient mir-1 plasmids belonged to the n incompatibility group. thus, the resistance of these k. pneumoniae strains was the result of plasmid acquisition of a class i beta-lactamase, a new resistance determinant that expands the kinds of beta-lactam resistance capable of spread by plasmid dissemination among clinical  isolates.

AB  == fournier's gangrene is defined classically as a fulminant, rapidly spreading infection of the scrotum that also involves the perineum, penis and abdominal wall. the pathologic findings are described as synergistic gangrene secondary to  a polymicrobial flora with a poorly defined portal of entry. we report 3 cases of fournier's gangrene. case 1 was a 67 years old who was admitted with the chief complaint of scrotal swelling and necrosis. case 2 was a 59 years old who was admitted with the problem of scrotal swelling and pain, he had sought other medical help without success, and was then transferred to our hospital. case 3 was a 62 years old who was admitted with the chief complaint of scrotal swelling  and pain for 2 days. these 3 patients were all found to have diabetes mellitus. all 3 patients required aggressive surgical debridement, broad-spectrum antibiotics and adjunctive measures. blood cultures were usually negative and pus cultures were typically aerobic gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria of various types, especially bacteroids fragilis. our pus cultures revealed escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus in case 1, enterobacter cloacae in case 2 and e. coli, b. fragilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa in case 3. this disease is no longer a disease of young men. after 1945, the average age in 119 reported cases was 51.3 years and the average age of our cases was 62.7 years. before the era of antibiotics, scrotal gangrene was not a rarity. in these modern times, in spite of seeking medical attention early, patients still developed scrotal gangrene and the mortality rate is high.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == antibacterial activity in the hemolymph of myriapods (arthropoda).
AB  == the hemolymphs of two diplopod (chicobolus sp. and rhapidostreptus virgator) and  two chilopod species (lithobius forficatus and scolopendra cingulata) were tested for the presence of antibacterial substances using petri dish tests. the native hemolymph of all species had substances acting on living micrococcus luteus, whereas only rhapidostreptus, scolopendra, and lithobius were effective against lyophilized micrococcus. the antibacterial activity against living micrococcus increased after inoculation with bacteria (enterobacter cloacae beta-12) in chicobolus and rhapidostreptus and also against lyophilized micrococcus in the latter. thus, these effects appear to be inducible. none of the myriapods tested  had any bacteriostatic effect on escherichia coli d-31 whereas the growth of gram-negative e. cloacae was inhibited. the antibacterial substances in the diplopod species were unstable when heated but were resistant to freezing. at least two antibacterial substances (a lysozyme-like one and another substance) are considered to occur in myriapoda.

AB  == we determined the mics of ampicillin, methicillin, cefaclor, cefixime, cefteram,  ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against a total of 1,448 strains from 11 species: 464 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 306 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 114 strains of streptococcus pyogenes, 37 strains of branhamella catarrhalis, 329 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 32 strains of escherichia coli, 66 strains of  klebsiella pneumoniae, 26 strains of enterobacter cloacae, 20 strains of serratia marcescens, 12 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 42 strains of acinetobacter  calcoaceticus, isolated from the throat swab and the sputum of 2,539 patients with respiratory infections who visited 21 private clinics in tohoku district of  japan during the period from january to april in 1989. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were more active against s. aureus, b. catarrhalis, p. aeruginosa and a. calcoaceticus than other antibiotics. ampicillin and cefteram were more active against s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes than other antibiotics. new-quinolones and  cephems of new-generation were active against h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae and s. marcescens. of 30 strains of s. aureus which were resistant (mic greater than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml) to ampicillin, only one strain was resistant (mic greater than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml) to methicillin. twenty strains (6.5%) of s. pneumoniae and 49 strains (14.9%) of h.  influenzae were resistant (mic greater than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml) to ampicillin. of 101 strains of h. influenzae of which their beta-lactamase activity was determined by nitrocephin-method, 27 (26.7%) were beta-lactamase-positive strains. the above results indicated that mrsa is only rarely found in primary care clinics but the incidence of ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae in primary care clinics is almost the same as that of the intensive care clinic, i.e. medical school-affiliated hospitals. therefore caution should be exercised as regards antibiotic resistance of the causative organism even in primary care clinics.

TI  == in-vitro antibacterial activity of dq-2556 and its stability to various beta-lactamases.
AB  == dq-2556, a new cephalosporin, showed a broad antibacterial spectrum over gram-positive and -negative organisms. the activity of dq-2556 against recent clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci and enterobacteriaceae was comparable with that of cefpirome, and superior to that of ceftazidime. dq-2556 was almost as active as cefpirome against pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was less active than ceftazidime. with the exception of ps. aeruginosa, dq-2556 was bactericidal against various organisms at either the mic or twice the mic. dq-2556 bound preferentially to penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) 2, 1 and 3 of staphylococcus aureus, pbps 3, 1a and 1b of escherichia coli and pbps 1a, 3 and 4 of ps. aeruginosa. dq-2556 was stable to various penicillinases and cephalosporinases, but was unstable to oxyiminocephalosporinases. the km values of dq-2556 for the cephalosporinases of citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae were only two- or three-fold higher than those of ceftazidime, indicating that dq-2556 had a relatively high affinity for these enzymes compared with other recently developed cephalosporins. the mic of dq-2556 for esch. coli increased four-fold in an ompf-deficient mutant, indicating that the ompf porin was one of the major routes for penetration of dq-2556 into esch. coli cells.

TI  == isolation and characterization of a beta-lactamase-inhibitory protein from streptomyces clavuligerus and cloning and analysis of the corresponding gene.
AB  == culture filtrates of streptomyces clavuligerus contain a proteinaceous beta-lactamase inhibitor (blip) in addition to a variety of beta-lactam compounds. blip was first detected by its ability to inhibit bactopenase, a penicillinase derived from bacillus cereus, but it has also been shown to inhibit the plasmid puc- and chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases of escherichia coli.  blip showed no inhibitory effect against enterobacter cloacae beta-lactamase, and it also showed no activity against an alternative source of b. cereus penicillinase. blip was purified to homogeneity, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gave a size estimate for blip of 16,900 to 18,000. the interaction between purified blip and the e. coli(puc) beta-lactamase was investigated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and determined to be noncovalent, with an estimated 1:1 molar stoichiometry. the blip gene was isolated on a 13.5-kilobase fragment of s. clavuligerus chromosomal dna which did not overlap a 40-kilobase region of dna known to contain genes for beta-lactam antibiotic biosynthesis. the gene encoded  a mature protein with a deduced amino acid sequence of 165 residues (calculated molecular weight of 17,523) and also encoded a 36-amino-acid signal sequence. no  significant sequence similarity to blip was found by pairwise comparisons using various protein and nucleotide sequence data banks or by hybridization experiments, and no blip activity was detected in the culture supernatants of other streptomyces spp.

AB  == 3'-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase [aph(3')] enzymes are a group responsible for resistance to the antibiotics kanamycin (km) and neomycin (nm) in bacteria. escherichia coli ect24, originally isolated from a meat sample, harboured an 83-kb conjugative r-plasmid (prpj24) that carries transferable resistance to km and nm. plasmid prpj24 was transferred by conjugation to enterobacter cloacae 94r, which was used as the source of plasmid dna in development of a probe for the km-resistance determinant. random cloning of bamhi and hindiii double-digest  restriction fragments of prpj24 in the puc18 vector plasmid produced clones resistant to both nm and km carrying a 1.9-kb dna insert. southern hybridization  of prpj24 cloned chimeric plasmid dna (pkpj94) showed homology with the aph(3')ii gene from transposon tn5. a psti digest of pkpj94 produced a 920-bp fragment which hybridized with the aph(3')ii structural gene, and was used as a dna probe  for the aph(3')ii subclass gene. a 980-bp bamhi fragment from plasmid pgh54 carrying the aph(3')i gene from transposon tn903 was used as a subclass i probe.  total dna from 206 randomly screened km-resistant enterobacteriaceae isolates from raw ground beef and chicken meat samples were examined for the occurrence of aph(3') subclass i and ii using non-radioactively-labelled dna probes. thirty-six percent and 60% of the isolates examined carried subclass i and ii resistances, respectively, in the isolates from chicken meat samples. the corresponding values for bacterial strains from raw ground beef samples were 51% and 72%, respectively. four percent of the resistant bacterial isolates from chicken samples did not display homology to either probe.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == molecular characterization of an enterobacter cloacae gene (roma) which pleiotropically inhibits the expression of escherichia coli outer membrane proteins.
AB  == the introduction of a newly cloned enterobacter cloacae chromosomal gene roma, into escherichia coli and e. cloacae resulted in enhancement of resistance to quinolones, beta-lactams, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline. the primary effect of roma on a multicopy vector in e. coli was almost complete inhibition of ompf expression in the outer membrane. from the experiments with ompr and envz mutants or with ompf-lacz and ompc-lacz fusion plasmids, it was concluded that this inhibition is posttranscriptional. the introduction of roma on a multicopy vector into strains with micf deletion elicited only a moderate decrease in ompf protein expression. this indicates that reduction of ompf expression by roma is partly mediated posttranscriptionally by the activation of micf. moreover, the overexpression of roma protein from an isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside (iptg)-inducible promoter resulted in nearly complete inhibition of expression of ompc and ompa, as well as ompf. taken together with an observation in a recent study that overexpressed ompc inhibited the synthesis of ompa and lamb, a possible inhibitory mechanism at the translational stage of the synthesis of outer membrane proteins should also be considered. by southern hybridization, roma was generally detected in the chromosomes of all e. cloacae strains tested but not in the e. coli k-12 chromosome. sequence data show that there is an open  reading frame specifying 368 amino acids residues including a putative signal peptide. roma appears to belong to the outer membrane protein family since it was extractable from an outer membrane preparation, but no sequence homology to other outer membrane proteins was detected.

AB  == the inhibition of supercoiling activity of reconstituted escherichia coli dna gyrase by lomefloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and norfloxacin was determined. the concentrations of quinolones needed to inhibit dna synthesis in escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus were also measured. the kinetics of uptake  of [14c]lomefloxacin and unlabeled lomefloxacin into whole cells of e. coli kl-16 and s. aureus nctc 8532 and the induction of reca in e. coli gc2241 were assayed. all strains had wild-type susceptibilities to quinolones. the concentration of quinolones needed to inhibit dna synthesis by 50% correlated with the mic for members of the family enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa. the concentration of  quinolones needed to inhibit dna synthesis by 50% for late-logarithmic-phase s. aureus also correlated with the mic, unlike the data from early-logarithmic-phase cultures. e. coli and s. aureus showed a similar pattern of uptake kinetics of [14c]lomefloxacin and unlabeled lomefloxacin, indicating that the difference in the susceptibilities of the two species is probably due to different target site  affinities. essentially, lomefloxacin was less active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin and had activity similar to those of norfloxacin and enoxacin.

TI  == [comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1987). i. susceptibility distribution].
AB  == since 1979, ikemoto et al. have been retrospectively surveying the sensitivity of major species of bacteria isolated from patients with urinary tract infections to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics. their findings for the past year are reported below. a total of 825 clinical strains of bacteria was investigated. of this total, gram-positive bacteria accounted for 28.0% (231 strains) and gram-negative bacteria for 72.0% (594 strains). taxonomically, escherichia coli accounted for 34.7% (286 strains), enterococcus faecalis for 14.3% (118), pseudomonas aeruginosa for 11.0% (91), klebsiella pneumoniae for 7.8% (64), and coagulase-negative staphylococci for 7.3% (60). sensitivity spectra of these major bacteria to various drugs were as follows. 1. e. faecalis was sensitive to  parenteral imipenem (ipm) and ampicillin and oral vancomycin. it was also sensitive to ofloxacin (oflx) and ciprofloxacin (cpfx), which are new quinolones. some strains were only slightly sensitive to second and third generation cephems  cefmenoxime (cmx) and cefuzonam (czon) aminoglycosides amikacin (amk) and arbekacin (hbk), and erythromycin which is a macrolide. 2. staphylococcus aureus  was sensitive to dicloxacillin (mdipc) which is a penicillin drug, cefotiam (ctm) which is a cephem, ipm, minocycline (mino), and hbk. a fairly large number of strains were only slightly sensitive to cefazolin (cez), oflx and cpfx. 3. coagulase-negative staphylococci were sensitive to mdipc which is a penicillin derivative, cephems ctm and czon, ipm, hbk, clindamycin (cldm) and mino. some strains, however, were only slightly sensitive to a majority of these drugs. 4. e. coli was sensitive to ctm, cmx, latamoxef (lmox), ceftazidime (caz), czon, and flomoxef (fmox), all of which are second or third generation cephems. it was also sensitive to ipm, a carbapenem, carumonam (crmn), a monobactam, and new quinolones, oflx and cpfx. 5. k. pneumoniae was sensitive to cephems, viz. ctm, caz, czon, fmox and cefixime, crmn which is a monobactam, ipm, a carbapenem and new quinolones, oflx and cpfx. some strains were only slightly sensitive to ctm,  cefmetazole cefoperazone (cpz), and fmox. 6. citrobacter freundii was sensitive to crmn which is a monobactam, and new quinolones, oflx and cpfx. many strains were only slightly sensitive to cephems, viz. cez, ctm, cpz and caz. 7. enterobacter cloacae was sensitive to gentamicin and amk which are aminoglycosides, but showed a bimodal pattern of sensitivity to cpz, caz and czon, all of which are cephems, and to quinolones, oflx and cpfx.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == the in vitro activity of sparfloxacin (ci-978, at-4140), a new quinolone which is active against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, and nine other broad-spectrum antibiotics was tested against 128 gram-negative nosocomial bloodstream isolates from separate patients. sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were  among the most potent antibiotics against escherichia coli (n = 40), enterobacter cloacae (n = 18), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 13), and klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 19), with mic90 values of less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. ciprofloxacin  was slightly more potent than sparfloxacin against serratia marcescens (n = 14),  the mic90 values being 0.25 and 1.0 micrograms/ml respectively, although all strains were susceptible to both agents. sparfloxacin was slightly less potent than ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 24), the mic90 values being 4.0 and 0.5 micrograms/ml respectively. overall, the in vitro activity of sparfloxacin compared favorably with that of ciprofloxacin and the other broad spectrum agents tested against nosocomial gram-negative bloodstream isolates.

TI  == determination of optimal dosage regimen for amikacin in healthy volunteers by study of pharmacokinetics and bactericidal activity.
AB  == the pharmacokinetics and serum killing curves of amikacin, which was administered by a 30-minute intravenous infusion of single doses of 7.5 mg/kg and then 15 mg/kg, were investigated in six healthy volunteers who received the two doses in  a crossover study with a washout period of 20 days. the serum killing curves were determined for four bacterial species: escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. all strains were serum resistant, and the bactericidal activity was analyzed by separating the early phase (first 5 h) and the late phase (24 h) of the killing curve. for the early phase, the bactericidal activity was evaluated by correlating an index of surviving bacteria with amikacin concentrations. this methodology allowed determination of two parameters: the maximal effective concentration and the lowest effective concentration. for the late phase, the threshold values separating bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities were lower than 10 mg/liter for each strain. the concentration dependence of amikacin bactericidal activity was confirmed for escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae and, to a lesser extent, for serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. correlation of these  data with amikacin pharmacokinetic data in volunteers indicated that a daily dose of 15 mg/kg may be effective in the treatment of escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae infections. for pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens, the partially time-dependent activity probably necessitates two daily administrations and combination with another antibiotic.

AB  == clinical and pharmacokinetic studies on aztreonam (azt) were performed in neonates. the results are summarized as follows: a total of 6 cases consisting of 5 mature and 1 low-birth-weight infants was clinically evaluated. azt 20 mg/kg was administered 2-3 times daily, via 1 hour intravenous drip infusion for 6-21 days. concomitantly, vancomycin (vcm) 15 mg/kg was administered to 1 case 3 times daily, via 1 hour intravenous drip infusion for 3 days and ampicillin (abpc) 20-50 mg/kg to 3 cases 3 time daily via 30 minutes intravenous drip infusion for  2-6 days. of the 6 bacterial infection cases (1 with sepsis and purulent meningitis, 2 with sepsis, 2 with urinary tract infection and 1 with perirectal abscess), clinical effects of azt were evaluated in 4 cases (2 each with sepsis and urinary tract infection) as "excellent" in all the cases. all of the causative organisms (escherichia coli in 3 and enterobacter cloacae in 1) were eradicated by the treatment with azt. neither clinical side effect nor abnormal laboratory test value caused by azt was observed. mics of azt against 10 clinical isolates (staphylococcus aureus 1, e. coli 4, klebsiella pneumoniae 1, e. cloacae 1, haemophilus influenzae 1 and pseudomonas aeruginosa 2) from neonatal patients  with bacterial infections were examined. as results, azt showed very good antibacterial activity comparable or even superior to cefoperazone, cefotaxime, latamoxef; however, the activity against p. aeruginosa was inferior to imipenem.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == molecular epidemiology of tem-3 (ctx-1) beta-lactamase.
AB  == a total of 33 clinical isolates encoding tem-3 (ctx-1) from four french hospitals were studied. the strains belonged to seven species, klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 24), escherichia coli (n = 3), serratia marcescens (n = 2), citrobacter freundii  (n = 1), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 1), enterobacter cloacae (n = 1), and klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1). all the strains harbored an inc7 or m self-transferable plasmid with a size of approximately 85 kilobases. the plasmids had closely related ecori, hincii, hindiii, and pvuii restriction endonuclease-generated patterns and conferred resistance to all beta-lactams, except cephamycins and imipenem; to tetracycline, because of the presence of the  genes blatem-3 and tetc, respectively, as determined by hybridization with specific probes; and to sulfonamide. depending on the presence or absence and level of expression of the genes aaca4, aada, and dfri and of insertion element is15, four types of plasmids could be distinguished. plasmid pcff04, the prototype plasmid encoding tem-3, was widespread and appeared, by southern hybridization, as the progenitor of the other types of replicons. the plasmid epidemic responsible for dissemination of tem-3 in clinical isolates of members of the family enterobacteriaceae may have originated in s. marcescens since pcff04 was first detected in this species.

TI  == outer membrane permeability and beta-lactamase stability of dipolar ionic cephalosporins containing methoxyimino substituents.
AB  == some enteric bacteria, such as enterobacter cloacae, can develop high-level resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins by overproducing their chromosomally  encoded type i beta-lactamases. this is because these agents are hydrolyzed rapidly at pharmacologically relevant, low (0.1 to 1 microm), concentrations, owing to their high affinity for type i enzymes. in contrast, the more recently developed cephalosporins, with quaternary-nitrogen-containing substituents at the 3 position, show increased efficacy against beta-lactamase-overproducing strains  and, indeed, have a much lower affinity for type i enzymes. however, the possible contribution of an improved outer membrane permeability in their increased efficacy has not been studied. we found by proteoliposome swelling assays that cefepime, cefpirome, and e-1040 all penetrated the porin channels of escherichia  coli and e. cloacae much more rapidly than did ceftazidime and at least as rapidly as did cefotaxime. considering that the influx of anionic compounds such  as cefotaxime and ceftazidime will be further retarded in intact cells, owing to  the donnan potential, we expect that the newer compounds will penetrate intact cells 2 to 10 times more rapidly than will cefotaxime and ceftazidime. the kinetic parameters of hydrolysis of these agents by e. cloacae beta-lactamase showed that at 0.1 microm, they were hydrolyzed much more slowly than was cefotaxime and at about the same rate as or a lower rate than was ceftazidime. the combination of these two effects explains nearly quantitatively why these newer agents are more effective against some of the beta-lactamase-overproducing  gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == all serratia marcescens strains (total of 33) of different sources were hemolytic including clinical strains previously classified as being nonhemolytic. dna fragments of the two hemolysin genes hybridized with the chromosomal dna of s. marcescens, s. liquefaciens, s. kiliensis, s. grimesii, s. proteamaculans, s. plymutica, s. rubridaea which were also hemolytic. the restriction pattern of the hemolysin locus differed in each strain. s. ficaria and s. marinorubra expressed  a different hemolysin which was much smaller than the s. marcescens hemolysin since it diffused through dialysis membranes. the dna of the latter strains did not hybridize with the s. marcescens hemolysin dna probes. some s. marcescens strains, s. kiliensis and s. liquefaciens also expressed in addition the small hemolysin. no hybridization was found with dna of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella arerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosus, listeria sp.,  aeromonas sp., legionella sp. and a meninococcus sp., indicating that the hemolysin dna probes are specific for serratia, or that the hemolysin genes occur rarely in genera other than serratia.

AB  == the effectiveness of a combination of the recently developed penam sulphone tazobactam with piperacillin was studied in clinical isolates with defined beta-lactamase production. the combination was highly effective against piperacillin-resistant beta-lactamase-producing staphylococcus aureus, tem-1-producing escherichia coli and proteus vulgaris isolates. it was less effective against e. coli isolates producing the oxa-1 enzyme and marginally active against tem-1-producing klebsiella spp. isolates. the presence of tazobactam at a concentration of 10 mg/l markedly reduced the minimal inhibitory  concentrations for piperacillin in most of the beta-lactamase-derepressed enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens and citrobacter freundii isolates; however, this synergism was much less pronounced in beta-lactamase-derepressed klebsiella spp. isolates. the selection frequency of resistant clones from clinical e. cloacae and c. freundii isolates could be markedly reduced by the addition of 10 mg/l tazobactam to the piperacillin-containing selective medium. resistant clones could be obtained only from part of the wild-type strains at 2 or 4 times the mic of piperacillin in the presence of tazobactam, whereas resistant clones could be selected up to 64 times the mic of piperacillin without the addition of tazobactam. this aspect deserves attention with respect to the rapid selection of beta-lactamase-derepressed clones from nosocomial pathogens.

AB  == in a single-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial, 100 successive patients were enrolled with serious skin and soft-tissue infections, whose illnesses had precipitated an initial hospital admission or an extension of inpatient care. there were 93 evaluable patients who received either ofloxacin, 400 mg orally every 12 hours plus an intravenously administered placebo every eight hours, or cefotaxime, 2.0 g intravenously every eight hours plus an orally administered placebo every 12 hours. the average length of therapy was 12 days. both patient groups had similar demographics and underlying conditions. wound infection was the most common diagnosis, followed by abscess, cellulitis, and trophic ulcer. multiple pathogens were commonly isolated from infected sites (1.4 pathogens/patient). the most common pathogen was staphylococcus aureus, followed  by escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, proteus/providencia spp., and enterobacter spp. persistence of the initial pathogen at the end of therapy was observed in 22.5 percent of the cefotaxime-treated group, but in only 10 percent of the ofloxacin-treated group.  there was one clinical failure in the cefotaxime group, caused by a susceptible strain of enterobacter cloacae, and there was one clinical failure in the ofloxacin group, in which the patient had an acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. anitratus wound infection and subsequently developed a p. aeruginosa superinfection. adverse experiences, including rash, insomnia, and nausea, occurred in 16 percent of the patients in each group. it was concluded that oral  ofloxacin is as safe and efficacious as parenteral cefotaxime in the treatment of serious skin and skin structure infections.

TI  == ampg is essential for high-level expression of ampc beta-lactamase in enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == mutants of enterobacter cloacae 55 were studied to delineate more completely the  genetics of inducible expression of ampc beta-lactamase. e. cloacae 55m-l, derived by mutagenesis from a mutant with high-level cefotaxime resistance (mic,  greater than 64 micrograms/ml), e. cloacae 55m, demonstrated a novel phenotype by producing only low levels of ampc constitutively. neither the parental phenotype  of e. cloacae 55m nor the wild-type phenotype of e. cloacae 55 could be restored  in e. cloacae 55m-l by the introduction of functional ampr, ampc, or ampd genes.  cloning each of these genes from e. cloacae 55m-l confirmed the same genotype for this mutant as for its parental strain. mutation of e. cloacae 55m-l to the e. cloacae 55m phenotype was found to occur spontaneously at a frequency of 10(-8).  all such revertants demonstrated an inducible wild-type phenotype after introduction of a functional ampd. these results suggested that the e. cloacae 55m-l phenotype was due to a mutation in an as yet unrecognized gene, designated  ampg. verification of this gene was obtained by the restoration of the e. cloacae 55m phenotype in e. cloacae 55m-l by introduction of a cloned 2.9-kilobase bamhi  fragment from the e. cloacae 55 chromosome. transformation of both ampg and ampd  into e. cloacae 55m-l reconstituted the inducible wild-type phenotype. these results indicate that ampg is required for the activation of ampc by ampr. without ampg, neither induction nor high-level expression of ampc is possible. it is likely that the ampg gene product and ampd together modulate the ability of ampr to activate ampc expression.

TI  == glutathione transferase in bacteria: subunit composition and antigenic characterization.
AB  == the presence of glutathione transferase (gst; ec 2.5.1.18) in escherichia coli atcc 25922, e. coli atcc 25422, proteus vulgaris atcc 8427, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, klebsiella oxytoca cip 666, k. oxytoca af 101, enterobacter cloacae cip 6085, serratia marcescens cip 6755, and proteus mirabilis af 2924 was investigated. using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as substrate, gst activity was found in the glutathione-(gsh-)affinity-purified fraction of all strains tested. sds-page analysis of gsh-affinity-purified enzyme indicated that the gsts of all these bacteria are dimers of two identical subunits of mr about 22,500. rabbit antiserum directed against the major isoenzyme present in proteus mirabilis af 2924, pm-gst-6.0, was used to investigate the antigenic properties of bacterial gsts. western blot analysis indicated that a gst antigenically identical to pm-gst-6.0 is present in enterobacter cloacae cip 6085, escherichia coli atcc 25422 and proteus vulgaris atcc 8427, but absent in escherichia coli atcc 25922, klebsiella oxytoca cip 666, k. oxytoca af 101 and serratia marcescens cip 6755. the presence of pm-gst-6.0, but not mammalian gst, increased the mic values of amikacin, ampicillin, cefotaxime, cephalothin and nalidixic acid for e. coli atcc 25922. it is suggested that bacterial gst may represent a defense against the effects of antibiotics.

TI  == purification, composition, and activity of two bactenecins, antibacterial peptides of bovine neutrophils.
AB  == extracts of granules of bovine neutrophils are known to exhibit a marked antibacterial activity in vitro. by a simple, two-step chromatographic procedure, we have resolved two peptide components of the antibacterial system. they were named bac-5 and bac-7 from the general term bactenecin and had molecular masses of about 5 and 7 kilodaltons, respectively. over 45 and 20% of the amino acid residues in the two bactenecins are proline and arginine, respectively. the remaining amino acids are mainly hydrophobic (isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine). both bac-5 and bac-7 efficiently kill escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, and klebsiella pneumoniae. they also arrest the growth of enterobacter cloacae (mics, 25 to 200 micrograms/ml) but not of proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae (mic, greater than 200 micrograms/ml). finally, bac-7 but not bac-5 has mics of less than or equal to 200 micrograms/ml for pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis. from the comparison between the efficient bactericidal concentrations in vitro and the estimated content of bactenecins in neutrophils (125 ng of bac-5 and bac-7 each per 10(6) cells), it is reasonable to conclude that the two cationic peptides may exert a major role in host defense against at least some microorganisms.

TI  == evaluation of numerical analysis of sds-page of protein patterns for typing enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == twenty cultures comprising 13 clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae from two  hospitals, the type and another reference stain of e. cloacae and the type strains of four other enterobacter sp. and of escherichia coli, were characterized by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) of whole-cell proteins. the protein patterns were highly reproducible and were used as the basis of a numerical analysis which divided the clinical isolates into nine clearly defined protein types. comparison with established typing methods indicated that the discrimination of sds-page was similar to that achieved with conventional typing methods and all strain groups recognized by combined sero/phage typing were also found by sds-page. in addition, protein typing sub-divided a group of four serotype o3 isolates that were difficult to distinguish by phage typing. we conclude that high-resolution sds-page of proteins provides an effective method of typing isolates of e. cloacae.

TI  == bactericidal activity of meropenem and interactions with other antibiotics.
AB  == mics of meropenem for selected clinical isolates of bacteria were determined. killing curves were performed on strains of methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus  aureus, methicillin-resistant staph. aureus (mrsa), methicillin-resistant staph,  epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter freundii and acinetobacter spp. a reduction of greater than or equal to 3 x log10 in viable cells was observed at 4 and 6 h of exposure  to 4 and 8 x mic, and this was usually maintained at 24 h (with a few exceptions  for methicillin-resistant staph, epidermidis and ent. cloacae). at the mic and twice the mic regrowth tended to occur at 24 h although this varied from strain to strain. the interaction with other antibiotics was determined by the chequerboard technique. usually an additive or synergistic effect was observed when meropenem or imipenem was used in combination with an aminoglycoside against gram-negative species, while in a few cases antagonism occurred in combination with beta-lactams. against staph, aureus, mrsa and staph, epidermidis synergism was usually obtained with combinations with teicoplanin or vancomycin and either  synergism or addition with combinations with rifampicin, co-trimoxazole or ciprofloxacin.

TI  == cefotaxime pharmacokinetics and treatment of meningitis in neonates.
AB  == pharmacokinetic studies on cefotaxime/desacetylcefotaxime were carried out in very low birth weight newborns (n = 18; 500-1500 g; 28.4 +/- 2.4 weeks gestational age) during the first week of life. we have previously reported that  the elimination t 1/2 of cefotaxime (3.4-6.4 h) and desacetylcefotaxime (9.4 h) was longer than previously described in term infants and children. in very low birth weight neonates, a single 50 mg/kg daily dose of cefotaxime may produce accumulation of the metabolite desacetylcefotaxime in serum. in a non-comparative prospective clinical trail, 22 infants (one week - three months) were treated for gram-negative enteric bacillary meningitis with cefotaxime at a dosage of 50 mg/kg/day. the predominant pathogen was escherichia coli in 14 cases and enterobacter cloacae in four cases. cultures of the cerebrospinal fluid obtained  24-48 h after the initiation of treatment were sterile in all subjects. survival  and complication rates of 95% and 19%, respectively, were observed. this compared favorably to previously published experiences with alternative treatment regimens for neonatal gram-negative enteric meningitis. in both the pharmacokinetic and meningitis studies, the safety profile for cefotaxime was excellent with no adverse reactions.

TI  == in-vitro activity of fce 22101 and other beta-lactam antibiotics against enterobacteriaceae resistant to third generation cephalosporins.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of fce 22101 was compared with those of imipenem, aztreonam, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone and latamoxef against 225 enterobacteriaceae (209 clinical isolates and 16 derivatives of escherichia coli k12) chosen for their resistance (mic greater than or equal to 8 mg/l) to third-generation cephalosporins. the beta-lactamases produced by the strains of enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and esch. coli were identified. the mean mics of fce 22101 were 2-8 mg/l for ent. cloacae, citrobacter freundii and morganella morganii. for ent. cloacae, the mics were slightly higher for the cephalosporinase non overproducing (5.5-8 mg/l) than for the cephalosporinase overproducing (4.5 mg/l) strains. the mean mic was 9 mg/l for serratia spp. but for half of the strains the mics were greater than or equal to 16 mg/l. the mics  of fce 22101 were 0.5-1 mg/l for the resistant clinical isolates or isogenic derivatives of k. pneumoniae and esch. coli producing extended broad-spectrum beta-lactamases (shv-2, shv-3 or ctx-1), whether measured in the presence of clavulanate or not, and against the sensitive controls. this showed that the compound was not affected by these new beta-lactamases. the mics of imipenem, on  the average four to five times lower than those of fce 22101, were found to be very similar for resistant and sensitive strains. the mics of aztreonam were high (32-128 mg/l) for c. freundii, k. oxytoca and cephalosporinase overproducing strains of ent. cloacae. there was cross-resistance between the third-generation  cephalosporins, but the mics of latamoxef remained low (1 mg/l) against m. morganii, klebsiella spp. and esch. coli.

TI  == regulation of enterobacterial cephalosporinase production: the role of a membrane-bound sensory transducer.
AB  == in clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae, resistance to the newer beta-lactam antibiotics often results from overproduction of a cephalosporinase encoded by the beta-lactam-inducible ampc gene. regulation of ampc is controlled by the divergently expressed activator gene, ampr, and a second unlinked locus. in this  presentation we show that although escherichia coli has lost its ampr gene it has retained the second regulatory locus and that this comprises the bicistronic ampde operon. genetic and biochemical studies define the ampd gene as encoding a  repressor for ampc transcription whereas the ampe gene product is a cytoplasmic membrane protein. inactivation of the ampd protein by mutation causes massive overproduction of cephalosporinase which, in e. cloacae, can terminate in therapeutic failure. in contrast, loss of ampe results in a total block in induction, despite the presence of the activator, ampr.

TI  == [investigations on the etiology of sepsis by using an experimental mouse model with leukocytopenia. 2. the role of the reticuloendothelial system in the etiology of bacteremia].
AB  == it has been recognized by clinical data that most of sepsis occurring in the immunocompromised host are endogenous infection. in recent years, we have investigated the mechanism of these bacteremia and sepsis by experimental studies using neutropenic mice treated with cyclophosphamide. and we evidenced that most  pathogens causing bacteremia originated in the intestinal flora of the host. it has been shown that bacteria causing bacteremia were divided into two main groups, causing systemic bacteremia and causing portal bacteremia. pseudomonas aeruginosa and morganella morganii belonged to the former, on the other hand, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and some other bacteria belonged to the latter. in this study, we studied the role of the reticuloendothelial system (res) in the etiology of bacteremia or sepsis, using various kinds of bacteria isolated from bacteremic mice. as a result, the following facts were revealed. 1. it was suggested that the low blood clearance rate of the bacteria was one of the great risk factor of systemic bacteremia, since the blood clearance rate of bacteria causing systemic bacteremia was significantly lower than those of bacteria causing portal bacteremia. 2. bacteria in the blood were eliminated by the res, mainly by the liver, and the level of bacterial clearance by the liver was relative to the type of bacteremia which was systemic or portal. 3. it was suggested that the bacterial clearance by the liver mainly reflected the phagocytosis by kupffer cells, and especially the adherence of these cells to bacteria as the first step of phagocytosis.

AB  == malolactic fermentation is a secondary fermentation that many lactic acid bacteria can carry out when l-malate is present in the medium. the activation of  the malolactic system in lactococcus lactis is mediated by a locus we call mler.  induction of the genes necessary to perform malolactic fermentation occurs only in bacteria with a functional copy of mler. the mler gene consists of one open reading frame capable of coding for a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 33,813 daltons. the amino acid sequence of the predicted mler gene product is homologous to that of positive activators in gram-negative bacteria: lysr, ilvy gene products of escherichia coli, metr, cysb of salmonella typhimurium, ampr of  enterobacter cloacae, nodd of rhizobium sp., and trpi of pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == bactericidal activity of tigemonam, alone and in combination with gentamicin.
AB  == the in vitro bactericidal activity of tigemonam, alone and in combination with gentamicin, was evaluated against various strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, salmonella enteritidis, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, and proteus vulgaris. minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations were determined on three consecutive days with an inoculum of 10(5) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml or a culture in the logarithmic growth phase. the results found tigemonam to be rapidly bactericidal against most enterobacteriaceae isolated. in addition, the killing curves indicated a synergism between tigemonam and subinhibitory concentrations of gentamicin.

TI  == antibacterial activity in vitro of tigemonam, a new oral monobactam.
AB  == using a broth microdilution method, the antibacterial activity of tigemonam, a novel oral monobactam, was evaluated against 217 gram-negative aerobes freshly isolated from clinical specimens. reference antibiotics were amoxicillin, amoxicillin-sulbactam, cephalexin, cefaclor, norfloxacin, and co-trimoxazole. at  a concentration of less than or equal to 8 mg/l, tigemonam inhibited 88% of the members of the enterobacteriaceae family. its activity was poor against the nonfermenter pathogens. in comparison with the other drugs, tigemonam generally exhibited superior antibacterial activity (with the exception of norfloxacin, which showed similar potency against the strains tested). minimum bactericidal concentrations and time-kill determinations indicated that tigemonam showed remarkable bactericidal activity, with a 9% reduction in colony-forming units after 2 h at a dose corresponding to fourfold its minimum inhibitory concentration. when tigemonam was used in combination with netilmicin and amikacin against susceptible representative isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens and escherichia coli, a synergistic effect was obtained.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigemonam against multiresistant nosocomial enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == tigemonam, an oral monobactam that exhibits beta-lactamase stability similar to that of aztreonam, was tested in vitro against 240 species of enterobacteriaceae  (50 escherichia coli, 48 klebsiella pneumoniae, 52 enterobacter cloacae, 32 proteus mirabilis, 22 proteus indole-positive [providencia sp.], 24 serratia sp., and 12 citrobacter sp. all strains were resistant to ampicillin and first-generation cephalosporins. in addition, 77.4% were resistant to amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, 46.8% to cefuroxime, 23.3% to ceftriaxone, 22.2% to aztreonam, 46.9% to cotrimoxazole, and 0.9% to norfloxacin. tigemonam at a concentration of 4 micrograms/ml or less inhibited 72.7% of the strains with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.03 or less to more than 512 micrograms/ml. the highest intrinsic activity was observed against proteus sp. tigemonam proved to be a bactericidal antibiotic. cross-resistance was chiefly observed with aztreonam and ceftriaxone. it is concluded that tigemonam should play an important role in the treatment of nosocomial infections that do not require parenteral therapy and in the treatment of multiresistant community-acquired infections.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == in-vitro activity of fce 22101 and synergy studies with other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == fce 22101 is a penem antibiotic with broad in-vitro activity similar to that of imipenem, although less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa. combinations of fce 22101 with ciprofloxacin or gentamicin against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant staph. epidermidis resulted in addition or indifference by the chequerboard method. the combination of fce 22101 and gentamicin against streptococcus faecalis was usually additive. against enterobacter cloacae fce 22101 had mics of 16 mg/l whilst in combination with gentamicin (0.25-0.12 mg/l) the mics were reduced to less than 2 mg/l. ciprofloxacin and fce 22101 showed only addition against enterobacter spp. similar results were obtained with the combinations of fce 22101 and gentamicin or ciprofloxacin tested against citrobacter freundii. with serratia spp. fce 22101 and gentamicin showed synergy, but fce 22101 and ciprofloxacin showed indifference. similar results were obtained with strains of escherichia coli and  klebsiella, proteus, and providencia spp. fce 22101 plus gentamicin, or aztreonam, against ps. aeruginosa usually showed indifference, but with ciprofloxacin addition was the rule. in general the combination of fce 22101 with other agents resulted in an additive rather than a synergistic effect.

AB  == the therapeutic activity of fce 22891 was compared with that of two new oral cephalosporins, cefuroxime axetil and cefixime against streptococcus pneumoniae respiratory infection and subcutaneous abscesses induced by mixed aerobes and anaerobes in mice. in experimental pneumonia fce 22891 was the most active antibiotic. in aerobic abscesses fce 22891 proved the most active agent in infections induced by methicillin susceptible and resistant staphylococcus aureus while all three compounds were very active, against str. pyogenes. in abscesses caused by gram-negative bacteria, fce 22891 showed good and constant efficacy. cefixime was the most active drug against the two susceptible strains of escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae and also against resistant esch. coli but was inactive against a strain of ent. cloacae that produced cephalosporinase. cefuroxime axetil was less active than the other two drugs against gram-negative  bacteria with adequate efficacy only against a susceptible strain of ent. cloacae. fce 22891 was more effective than cefixime and cefuroxime axetil in preventing and reducing the size of abscesses induced by bacteroides fragilis 101. we conclude that fce 22891, despite its short half life of 6 min in mice, exerts comparable and sometimes better activity than the two oral cephalosporins  characterized by longer half lives.

AB  == cefpirome (hr 810), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin derivative, was found to have a broad antibacterial spectrum against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. against staphylococcus aureus, cefpirome was more active than not only  cefotaxime and ceftazidime but also cefotiam. against gram-negative bacteria, especially, enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii, it was also more active than the other antibiotics tested, but against pseudomonas aeruginosa, it  was less active than ceftazidime. cefpirome was stable to hydrolysis by the common plasmid mediated beta-lactamases and was stable to the action of chromosomal cephalosporinases. but it was slightly hydrolyzed by both rms 213 mediated penicillinase and oxyiminocephalosporinases produced by proteus vulgaris and pseudomonas cepacia. when cefpirome was administered subcutaneously to mice experimentally infected with staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae or pseudomonas aeruginosa, its efficacy well reflected its in vitro potency.

AB  == the activity of cefpirome (hr 810) was evaluated against 247 strains isolated from patients developing their infections while in a hospital in buenos aires. its activity against gram negative bacilli was compared with ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cephalotin, piperacillin, amikacin, gentamicin and norfloxacin. in terms of mic50 and mic90 (mg/l) it was as follows: klebsiella pneumoniae: less than 0.125, less than 2.0; pseudomonas aeruginosa: less than 8, less than 16; escherichia coli: less than 0.016, less than 0.063; serratia marcescens: less than 0.063, less than 1.0; enterobacter cloacae: less than 0.125, less than 1.0.  cefpirome was more active than the other cephalosporins against p. aeruginosa: at 16 mg/l, this drug inhibited 95% of strains versus 60% for ceftazidime and 32% for ceftriaxone. activity of norfloxacine against gram negative bacilli was similar to cefpirome, while piperacillin and the aminoglycosides were less active. cefpirome was more active than cepahallotin against streptococcus faecalis (2.0, 32) although less active than ampicillin, piperacillin, rifampicin and vancomycin. against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (less than  0.25, less than 1.0) it was more active than cephalotin and the other drugs evaluated (piperacillin, erythromycin, chloranphenicol, aminogycosides). like cephalotin, the activity of cefpirome against methicillin-resistant strains was variable (1.0, 32).

TI  == in vitro susceptibility of bacteria to a ticarcillin-clavulanic acid combination.
AB  == in vitro testing of bacterial susceptibility to a combination of ticarcillin and  clavulanic acid was done, using 406 aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative isolates (considered to be pathogens) cultured from equine and small animal specimens. a microdilution broth technique of susceptibility testing was performed, using trays with wells containing a range of doubling concentrations of dehydrated ticarcillin (range, 0.50 to 128 micrograms/ml) with fixed concentration of clavulanic acid (4 micrograms/ml). the following isolates of equine origin were (90%) susceptible to concentrations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid combinations of less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively: staphylococcus aureus, s intermedius, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, ent agglomerans, ent cloacae, escherichia coli, actinobacillus sp, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, rhodococcus equi, proteus  vulgaris, and bordetella bronchiseptica. isolates of small animal origin (90%) susceptible to less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms of ticarcillinclavulanic/ml included s aureus, s intermedius, ent aerogenes, ent agglomerans, pasteurella multocida, b bronchiseptica, pr mirabilis, and serratia  sp.

TI  == survival of coliforms and bacterial pathogens within protozoa during chlorination.
AB  == the susceptibility of coliform bacteria and bacterial pathogens to free chlorine  residuals was determined before and after incubation with amoebae and ciliate protozoa. viability of bacteria was quantified to determine their resistance to free chlorine residuals when ingested by laboratory strains of acanthamoeba castellanii and tetrahymena pyriformis. cocultures of bacteria and protozoa were  incubated to facilitate ingestion of the bacteria and then were chlorinated, neutralized, and sonicated to release intracellular bacteria. qualitative susceptibility of protozoan strains to free chlorine was also assessed. protozoa  were shown to survive and grow after exposure to levels of free chlorine residuals that killed free-living bacteria. ingested coliforms escherichia coli,  citrobacter freundii, enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca and bacterial pathogens salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella sonnei, legionella gormanii, and campylobacter jejuni had increased resistance to free chlorine residuals. bacteria could be cultured from within treated protozoans well after the time required for 99% inactivation of free-living cells. all bacterial pathogens were  greater than 50-fold more resistant to free chlorine when ingested by t. pyriformis. escherichia coli ingested by a cyclidium sp., a ciliate isolated from a drinking water reservoir, were also shown to be more resistant to free chlorine. the mechanism that increased resistance appeared to be survival within  protozoan cells. this study indicates that bacteria can survive ingestion by protozoa. this bacterium-protozoan association provides bacteria with increased resistance to free chlorine residuals which can lead to persistence of bacteria in chlorine-treated water. we propose that resistance to digestion by predatory protozoa was an evolutionary precursor of pathogenicity in bacteria and that today it is a mechanism for survival of fastidious bacteria in dilute and inhospitable aquatic environments.

TI  == new aerobactin-mediated iron uptake system in a septicemia-causing strain of enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == unlike the great majority of the aerobactin-producing enteric bacteria documented in the literature, enterobacter cloacae ek33, isolated from a case of human neonatal meningitis, did not show any homology at the dna level with the prototype aerobactin system encoded by the colv-k30 plasmid. however, both the nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum and fast-atom bombardment mass spectrometry of the siderophore purified from ek33 confirmed its identity with aerobactin. bioassay screening of a gene library of total dna of ek33 led to the isolation of several aerobactin-positive clones. under conditions of iron limitation, these clones expressed in escherichia coli a protein of 72 kilodaltons that reacted with antiserum raised against the pcolv-k30 74-kilodalton aerobactin receptor, while the original e. cloacae strain synthesized an 85-kilodalton protein which also cross-reacted with the antiserum. restriction endonuclease analysis of the cloned dna confirmed the structural differences between the two aerobactin genetic systems.

TI  == value of surveillance cultures in the management of neutropenic patients.
AB  == to assess whether bacteriological surveillance cultures can be used to predict infection in neutropenic patients, cultures were performed during the period of neutropenia of nose, throat and urine specimens collected once weekly and faeces  specimens collected twice weekly. seventy-six consecutively observed patients undergoing chemotherapy for haematological or non-haematological diseases were investigated. severe infection including septicaemia, lower respiratory tract infection, anorectal lesion and urinary tract infection occurred in 32 patients.  enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the organisms most commonly involved. in the majority of cases of septicaemia the organisms were isolated from the faeces, often in pure culture, prior to the onset of septicaemia. most of the isolates of enterobacter cloacae were resistant to the empiric antibiotic therapy used in the unit and were able to colonise multiple sites, presumably increasing the risk of subsequent infection. faecal culture is the most useful approach in bacteriological surveillance in neutropenic patients.

TI  == a selection cartridge for rapid detection and analysis of spontaneous mutations including insertions of transposable elements in enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == we present a method that allows positive selection and rapid analysis of mutations in enterobacteriaceae. mutations are detected in a 2630 bp selection cartridge inserted in two different bacterial multicopy plasmid vectors. spontaneous mutations in escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii include insertions, deletions and point mutations. the small size of the target sequence facilitates rapid analysis of dna rearrangements by cleavage with restriction enzymes and of any type of mutation by dna sequence analysis. while in e. coli insertions of the mobile elements is1, is2 and is5 were readily found, insertions of putative new transposable elements were detected in enterobacter cloacae. the selection cartridge can thus serve as a tool for studying the spectrum of insertion mutations in enterobacteriaceae and probably other gram-negative bacteria, and the dependency of this spectrum on physiological and  environmental factors and the host's genetic background can be investigated.

AB  == antibacterial activities of monobactam antibiotics (carumonam (crmn) and aztreonam (azt] against gram-negative bacilli isolated from inpatients in the latter half of 1987 were investigated using penicillin (pc: piperacillin (pipc],  cephems (ceps: ceftazidime (caz), cefotaxime (ctx), latamoxef (lmox), cefsulodin  (cfs], carbapenem (imipenem (ipm] and pyridonecarboxylic acids (norfloxacin (nflx) and ofloxacin (oflx] as reference antibiotics. a total of 400 strains of 13 species, i.e. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and haemophilus influenzae, were used as test  strains. 1. crmn and azt, both monobactam antibiotics, were roughly comparable in their activities and no resistant strain to these antibiotics were found among isolates of e. coli, klebsiella spp., proteus spp., m. morganii, p. rettgeri or h. influenzae and few resistant strains were observed among isolates of s. marcescens. on the other hand, isolates of c. freundii, enterobacter spp. and p.  aeruginosa included rather numerous strains resistant to the monobactam antibiotics. among these cases, whereas r strains, i.e. resistant strains showing mics greater than or equal to 50 micrograms/ml, accounted for a large proportion  of strains resistant to pc and ceps, i strains, i.e. intermediately resistant strains showing mics between 12.5 and 25 micrograms/ml, accounted for a large proportion of strains resistant to the monobactam antibiotics. 2. strains resistant to pipc, a pc, were detected with high and more or less uniform frequencies over the entire spectrum of the isolates examined. 3. antibacterial activities of ceps varied against different bacterial species. while strains resistant to ctx, caz and lmox were commonly detected with high frequencies among isolates of c. freundii, enterobacter spp. and s. marcescens, large percentages of lmox-resistant strains of c. freundii and enterobacter spp. were of the i type. ctx-resistant strains were also found among isolates of p. vulgaris and m.  morganii. proportions of cep-resistant strains of p. aeruginosa were 28% for cfs  and 12% for caz. 4. no or few strains among the isolates of 13 species investigated were resistant to ipm, a carbapenem antibiotic, which showed the most stable antibacterial activity, but it was less active than monobactam antibiotics and ceps against klebsiella spp., p. mirabilis and h. influenzae.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

(1), enterobacter cloacae (1). all isolates were sensitive to the drug. of 5  cases with osteomyelitis, 2 were cured and 3 improved clinically (with bacteriological eradication of the pathogens). the best results were obtained in  patients with soft tissue infections: 4 patients were cured and 1 improved. two patients with salmonella bacteremia and aids experienced a recurrence 1 month and 2 months respectively after stopping therapy. the patient with mediastinitis was  successfully treated. improvement was recorded for 2 patients with bronchiectasis and exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. the drug was well tolerated, only one episode of mild nausea and vomiting was reported and did not require discontinuation of the therapy. the study indicates that ofloxacin is a safe and  effective agent in the treatment of various infections.

TI  == a large family of bacterial activator proteins.

TI  == bacteremia complicating acute leukemia with special reference to its incidence and changing etiological patterns.
AB  == over the 15-yr period, 1972-1986, 194 episodes of bacteremia occurred in 132 patients with acute leukemia at the third department of medicine, kanazawa university hospital, giving an incidence of 478 episodes per 1,000 hospital admissions. this incidence was at least twice as high as that in patients with chronic leukemia, malignant lymphoma, multiple myeloma or aplastic anemia, and about 40-fold higher than that in patients with all other internal diseases. the  rate of occurrence of bacteremia, whether unimicrobial or polymicrobial, remained almost unchanged throughout the study period. the frequency of gram-negative bacilli decreased significantly, however, from 81% of the total isolates for the  first 10-yr period to 50% for the second 5-yr period. escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated in markedly decreasing frequency, but pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae in relatively constant frequency. the majority of p. aeruginosa isolates belonged to a limited number of o-antigen  groups, suggesting the possibility of nosocomial infection. on the other hand, the frequency of gram-positive cocci increased from 9 to 36%. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus species, and staphylococcus aureus emerged as important pathogens. such a change in the spectrum of organisms was considered to coincide  with the common use of the so-called second- and third-generation cephalosporins  and central venous catheters. it is thus suggested that vancomycin be added to empiric antibiotic therapy, especially when gram-positive infections are clinically or microbiologically suspected, and that reducing the acquisition of p. aeruginosa from the hospital environment remains a priority in infection prevention.

AB  == a 13c-labeled cephalothin, 7 beta-(2-thienylacetamido)-3-[acetoxy-13c1]methyl-3-cephem-4- carboxylate (compound 1), has been prepared and used to monitor beta-lactamase activities by  13c nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. time-elapsed spectral analysis of the reaction of the labeled cephalothin with the tem-2 beta-lactamase purified from escherichia coli revealed the progressive loss of the cephalothin acetyl resonance at 176.8 ppm and accumulation of an acetate signal at 184.3 ppm. spectral results identical to those observed in the in vitro experiment were obtained when compound 1 was incubated with cell suspensions of e. coli jsr-o (pbr322), which contains the plasmid-encoded tem-2 beta-lactamase, and enterobacter cloacae strains that contain a class i chromosomal beta-lactamase. pseudo-first-order rate constants for the lactamase-catalyzed formation of acetate from cephalothin in vivo were obtained by integration of the 13c-acetyl resonances of compound 1 during timed incubations with cell preparations. these results constitute the first demonstration of the ability to monitor beta-lactamase activity in viable cells by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

AB  == the selection of aminoglycoside-resistant bowel flora, following the administration of either gentamicin or netilmicin in combination with metronidazole for prophylaxis, during colo-rectal surgery in 88 patients has been examined. both antibiotic regimens resulted in the selection of an aminoglycoside-resistant flora in a total of 57 (65%) of patients: in half of the patients there was a net gain in the aminoglycoside-resistant flora, and in 13 (15%) one aminoglycoside-resistant strain present prior to prophylaxis was displaced by another following operation. three patients (3%) lost aminoglycoside-resistant strains after prophylaxis. most of the resistant organisms selected were considered to be of little importance as potential pathogens, at least in the short term. in only a small minority (5%) of patients  were aminoglycoside-resistant enterobacteria isolated. aminoglycoside-resistant staphylococcus aureus was not isolated. of the resistant enterobacteria, only one strain, an isolate of enterobacter cloacae selected in a patient receiving gentamicin, carried a resistance determinant which was self-transmissible to escherichia coli.

TI  == simple assay of beta-lactamase with agar medium containing a chromogenic cephalosporin, pyridinium-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline chromophore (padac).
AB  == a new beta-lactamase assay method with agar plates containing pyridinium-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline chromophore (padac) (50 microm), a beta-lactamase-labile, chromogenic cephalosporin, was examined. on the padac plates inoculated with beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria (10(4) cfu per spot) and incubated at 37 degrees c, a yellow zone showing hydrolysis of padac by beta-lactamase was formed around the colony. the zone diameter increased with incubation time. examination with enterobacter cloacae gn7471 revealed that  beta-lactamase activity was present in the agar around the colony, decreasing exponentially with increasing distance from the colonial margin; this suggests that the padac hydrolysis zone is formed by an extracellular enzyme. at 18 h, significant correlations were obtained between the zone diameters of the 10 species (clinical isolates) examined and their periplasmic beta-lactamase activities determined spectrophotometrically. the addition of clavulanic acid (0.5 to 10 micrograms/ml) inhibited zone formation on the padac plates inoculated with type iiia, va, vb, pse-1, and ic beta-lactamase producers. when the clinical isolates were tested on plates with clavulanic acid (2 micrograms/ml), inhibition was observed in 41 to 58% of the escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates and in all isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, and proteus vulgaris. thus, the use of the inhibitor made it  possible to detect penicillinase or type ic cephalosporinase producers. these results proved that the padac plate might be a useful tool permitting easy, semiquantitative determination of beta-lactamase activity.

AB  == in an investigation of the influence of the ampd gene on beta-lactamase production and induction in enterobacter cloacae, the ampr-ampc gene region cloned into a plasmid and the ampd gene cloned into another vector were transferred to a strain of escherichia coli. the genetically manipulated e. coli  strains served as a model for study of the inducibility of beta-lactamases in e.  cloacae. in addition, beta-lactamase induction in e. cloacae bearing the previously mentioned plasmids was studied. after induction of the beta-lactamase  with cefoxitin, the specific hydrolytic activity, the viable cell count, and the  degradation of cefoxitin were determined. beta-lactamase expression decreased with an increasing amount of the ampd gene product. the cefoxitin concentration decreased in proportion to the amount of enzyme, but the induction of beta-lactamase seemed not to be an important factor influencing the viable cell count of e. cloacae as long as cefoxitin concentrations exceeded the mic. despite different beta-lactamase concentrations, the decrease in the viable cell count was nearly identical in all experiments.

AB  == the ampr gene and its regulation of ampc beta-lactamase synthesis were investigated for enterobacter cloacae 1194e, a wild-type strain producing a group a (pi 8.7) enzyme. expression of the cloned e. cloacae 1194e ampr-ampc region was examined initially in escherichia coli hb101. however, transformants showed only  constitutive beta-lactamase expression. for study of enzyme expression in a more  closely related host, the cloned e. cloacae 1194e ampr-ampc region was transformed into e. cloacae 55, a wild-type strain producing a group b (pi 7.8) enzyme. results indicated a functional e. cloacae 1194e ampr gene that could not  be transcomplemented by e. cloacae 55. a comparative analysis of ampr nucleotide  and amino acid-sequence data from e. cloacae 1194e and e. cloacae mhn1 revealed related but divergent genes. thermal induction studies of ampc beta-lactamase also indicated a difference between e. cloacae 1194e and e. cloacae 55 in ampr-ampc interaction. thus, it appears that, in at least some strains of enterobacter, significant intraspecies divergence of ampr has occurred. this heterogeneity in ampr would not have been detected with beta-lactamase expression studies conducted exclusively in e. coli.

TI  == antibacterial properties of (2,3)-alpha- and (2,3)-beta-methylene analogs of penicillin g.
AB  == the penam nucleus can assume two conformations; these are designated open and closed. the synthetic (2,3)-alpha- and (2,3)-beta-methylenepenams can be regarded as analogs of the open and closed conformations, respectively. it has been shown  that the beta-methylenepenams are essentially inactive, suggesting that the closed conformation of penams is also inactive. in this study, we investigated a  series of beta-lactams, all of which contained phenylacetamido side chains: penicillin g, the (2,3)-alpha- and (2,3)-beta-methylenepenams, and the 3-acetoxymethyl- and 3-methylcephalosporins. the alpha-methylenepenam and penicillin g were the most active compounds, while the beta-methylene isomer was  only poorly active. results with permeability mutants suggested that the alpha-methylene compound penetrated the outer membrane somewhat more readily than penicillin g did. the intrinsic potency of the alpha-methylenepenam appeared to be similar to that of penicillin g, on the basis of their affinities for penicillin-binding proteins and their abilities to inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis in ether-permeabilized escherichia coli, while the beta-methylene analog had very poor intrinsic potency. the alpha-methylene analog was about 10-fold more efficient (vmax/km) than penicillin g as a substrate for the cephalosporinases from enterobacter cloacae and proteus vulgaris, but it was about 40-fold less efficient with penicillinase from staphylococcus aureus. these results strongly support the hypothesis that the active conformation of penams is the open conformation and suggest that the position in space of the carboxyl group relative to the beta-lactam carbonyl is an important determinant of cephalosporinlike character, as distinct from penicillinlike character.

TI  == mechanism of inhibition of chromosomal beta-lactamases by third-generation cephalosporins.
AB  == the kinetic interactions of the beta-lactamase from enterobacter cloacae 908 r with ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime have been examined in detail. with  all of these cephalosporins, there is an initial rapid reaction involving opening of the beta-lactam that then decreases to a slower steady-state rate (kss) of beta-lactam hydrolysis (at 37 degrees c: ceftriaxone, kss = 0.044 s-1; cefotaxime, kss = 0.033 s-1; ceftazidime, kss = 0.011 s-1). more than stoichiometric quantities of beta-lactam are cleaved during the rapid phase, during which there is accumulation of a transiently stable cephalosporin-enzyme complex whose rate of breakdown is slower than the overall rate of hydrolysis. qualitatively similar behavior is observed with the e. cloacae m6300 beta-lactamase. these observations eliminate the possibility that the reaction follows a simple linear kinetic scheme. a branched kinetic scheme in which an initially formed acyl intermediate partitions between deacylation and elimination of the 3' substituent is proposed to explain the data. investigations of the interaction of ceftriaxone with the chromosomally encoded beta-lactamases from citrobacter freundii, providencia rettgeri, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli show that the partitioning behavior of e. cloacae beta-lactamases is atypical. all of the data, however, clearly demonstrate that it is a physical impossibility for cephalosporin trapping to contribute to bacterial resistance phenotypes.

AB  == the gram-negative fecal floras from 953 infants were studied upon discharge of the infants from 22 neonatal wards. more than 600 distinct phenotypes of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., and enterobacter spp. were distinguished by high-resolution biotyping. the colonization patterns observed showed considerable local and temporal variation. the major (m) strains (phenotypes), which colonized more than 10% and up to 78% of the infants in a ward (median, 23%), were klebsiella oxytoca (15 strains), e. coli (4 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1 strain), and enterobacter cloacae (1 strain). resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics was more pronounced among m strains than among strains of enteric bacteria colonizing few or single infants only. local antibiotic policy influenced the colonization patterns. despite the fact that m strains of klebsiella spp. were usually resistant to ampicillin as well as to cephalexin and cefuroxime, their local dissemination was associated with the use of ampicillin with or without gentamicin but not with the use of cefuroxime. it thus appeared that in the neonatal setting, ampicillin posed a greater risk of local spread of  certain drug-resistant bacterial clones than a newer cephalosporin, such as cefuroxime.

TI  == significance of bacterial flora in abdominal irradiation-induced inhibition of lung metastases.
AB  == we have previously reported that abdominal irradiation prior to i.v. injection of syngeneic tumor cells reduced metastases in lung. our report described an investigation of the significance of intestinal organisms in the radiation effect. we found that eliminating intestinal organisms with antibiotics totally abolished the radiation effect. monoassociation of germ-free mice revealed that the radiation effect was observable only for enterobacter cloacae, never for streptococcus faecium, bifidobacterium adlesentis, or escherichia coli. after abdominal irradiation of regular mice, e. cloacae multiplied in cecal contents, adhered to mucous membranes, invaded the cecal wall, and translocated to mesenteric lymph nodes. intravenous administration of e. cloacae in place of abdominal irradiation inhibited metastases. e. cloacae-monoassociated mice developed fewer metastases than germ-free mice, and the reduction was further enhanced by abdominal irradiation. we concluded that abdominal irradiation caused the invasion of e. cloacae from the mucous membrane of the intestine and inhibited formation of lung metastases.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of e1040, a new cephalosporin with potent antipseudomonal activity.
AB  == e1040 is a new parenteral cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum and potent antipseudomonal activity. the compound was four- to eightfold more active  than ceftazidime and cefsulodin against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic of e1040 for  90% of strains tested [mic90], 3.13 micrograms/ml). e1040 also showed a potent activity against other glucose-nonfermentative rods, including acinetobacter species. the activities of e1040 against most species of the family enterobacteriaceae were roughly comparable to the activities of ceftazidime and cefmenoxime and exceeded that of cefotiam. against citrobacter freundii (mic90, 0.78 micrograms/ml), enterobacter cloacae (mic90, 3.13 micrograms/ml), and enterobacter aerogenes (mic90, 0.2 micrograms/ml), e1040 was 16- to 256-fold more active than ceftazidime and cefmenoxime. the activities of e1040 against gram-positive cocci and anaerobes were comparable to those of ceftazidime, but the compound was less active than cefmenoxime. e1040 was at least as resistant as ceftazidime and cefmenoxime to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases and showed high affinities for penicillin-binding protein 3 of both escherichia coli and p.  aeruginosa.

TI  == lipid a precursor from pseudomonas aeruginosa is completely acylated prior to addition of 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate.
AB  == inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (lps) synthesis in pseudomonas aeruginosa at the stage of incorporation of 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate (kdo) caused accumulation  of a lipid a precursor which contained all of the fatty acids present on the lipid a of mature lps. the enzyme ctp:cmp-3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate cytidylyltransferase (cmp-kdo synthetase) from p. aeruginosa is inhibited by the  kdo analog alpha-c-[1,5-anhydro-8-amino-2,7,8-trideoxy-d-manno-octopyranosyl] carboxylate (i), and i is effectively delivered to p. aeruginosa following attachment by amide linkage to the carboxyl terminus of alanylalanine. intracellular hydrolysis releases the free inhibitor (i) which then inhibits activation of kdo by cmp-kdo synthetase causing accumulation of lipid a precursor and subsequent growth stasis. the major lipid a precursor species accumulated was purified and found to contain glucosamine, phosphate, c12:o, 2oh-c12:o and 3oh-c10:0 (in ester linkage), and 3oh-c12:0 (in amide linkage) in molar ratios of 1:1:0.5:0.5:1:1. analysis of precursor by fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy yielded a major ion (m - h)- of mass 1616 and fragments which were consistent with the structure of lipid a from p. aeruginosa. in contrast, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, citrobacter sp., serratia marcescens, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae all accumulated underacylated lipid a precursors which only contained 3-oh-c14:0, glucosamine, and phosphate. this difference and species-specific patterns of major and minor precursor species show that early steps in the assembly of lipid a are similar, but not identical in enteric and nonenteric gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == in vitro analytical system for determining the ability of antibiotics at residue  levels to select for resistance in bacteria.
AB  == an analytical procedure, based on the concept that exposure of bacteria to antibiotics will result in the selection of a resistant population, was developed. two strains of enteric bacteria, escherichia coli cs-1 and enterobacter cloacae b520, which are sensitive to a wide variety of antibiotics,  were used as the test organisms. e. coli cs-1 were exposed to 1.00 micrograms antibiotic or antimicrobial/ml; e. cloacae b520 were exposed to 0.01, 0.10, 0.50, 1.00, and 5.00 micrograms/ml. both organisms developed increased resistance to other antibiotics after exposure to chlortetracycline and oxytetracycline, as measured by the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic). e. cloacae b520 showed increased resistance to ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and chloramphenicol after exposure to levels as low as 0.10 microgram/ml. exposure to streptomycin, sulfamethazine, tylosin, bacitracin, flavomycin, virginiamycin, and monensin at levels of 1.00 microgram/ml did not increase the mic. exposure to 5.00 micrograms streptomycin, sulfamethazine, tylosin, and monensin/ml increased the mic of e. cloacae to one of the antibiotic markers. these increased mics exceeded the 95% confidence limits of the mic values of the unexposed organisms.

TI  == enoxacin: in-vitro and animal evaluation as a parenteral and oral agent against hospital bacterial isolates.
AB  == enoxacin was evaluated in in-vitro tests and in studies of effectiveness and blood concentrations in the mouse. enoxacin was active against both susceptible and multiresistant hospital isolates of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae and staphylococci. less susceptible were streptococci and anaerobes. of nine quinolones tested, only norfloxacin was equivalent in vitro. the mbcs of enoxacin were one- to twofold greater than the mics, and enoxacin was rapidly bactericidal. no single-step resistant mutants could be detected at 10 mg/l against large inocula and six to 11 steps were required for selection of resistant clones. in systemic mouse infections, enoxacin was effective in a single oral or subcutaneous dose against  one strain each of enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, providencia rettgeri and ps. aeruginosa, and two staphylococcus aureus strains. single oral and subcutaneous enoxacin doses (50 mg/kg) gave peak mouse blood levels of 4.9 and 9.5 mg/l and an elimination half-life of 1.8 h.

TI  == the humoral defense system in tsetse: differences in response due to age, sex and antigen types.
AB  == inoculation of live escherichia coli into tsetse flies, glossina morsitans morsitans, stimulated a higher antibacterial immune response in females than in males. it increased with age in females from emergence to approximately 2 weeks and thereafter declined. in males, there was also a significant decrease in immune response with aging. inoculation of killed bacteria failed to stimulate antibacterial activity but stimulated a lysozyme response which was weaker than that stimulated by live bacteria. no antibacterial activity was present in the hemolymph of larvae from immunized pregnant tsetse. inoculation of live trypanosoma brucei brucei and t. congolense failed to induce production of antibacterial activity and lysozyme. furthermore, tsetse inoculated with or naturally infected with t. b. brucei and t. congolense failed to show any evidence of immunosuppression when challenged with live e. coli. various species  of live bacteria stimulated different levels of antibacterial factors, with enterobacter cloacae stimulating the highest level of antibacterial activity and  e. coli the highest level of lysozyme. saline in which certain species of bacteria and t. b. brucei were incubated inactivated tsetse immune hemolymph.

TI  == tigemonam, an oral monobactam.
AB  == tigemonam is an orally administered monobactam. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml it inhibited the majority of strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter diversus, proteus spp., providencia spp., aeromonas hydrophila, salmonella spp., shigella spp., serratia marcescens,  and yersinia enterocolitica. at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml it inhibited haemophilus spp., neisseria spp., and branhamella catarrhalis. it did not inhibit pseudomonas spp. or acinetobacter spp. tigemonam was more active than cephalexin and amoxicillin-clavulanate and inhibited many members of the family enterobacteriaceae resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and gentamicin. some enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii strains resistant to aminothiazole iminomethoxy cephalosporins and aztreonam were resistant to tigemonam. the mic for 90% of hemolytic streptococci of groups a, b, and c and for streptococcus pneumoniae was 16 micrograms/ml, but the mic for 90% of enterococci, listeria spp., bacteroides spp., and viridans group streptococci was greater than 64 micrograms/ml. tigemonam was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases such as tem-1 and shv-1 or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of  enterobacter, morganella, pseudomonas, and bacteroides spp. tigemonam inhibited beta-lactamases of e. cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa but did not induce beta-lactamases. the growth medium had a minimal effect on the in vitro activity  of tigemonam, and there was a close agreement between the mics and mbcs.

TI  == cephalosporinase interactions and antimicrobial activity of bmy-28142, ceftazidime and cefotaxime.
AB  == cephalosporinases of enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii were responsible for resistance to newer cephalosporins such as cefotaxime and ceftazidime but not bmy-28142. interaction of these cephalosporins including hydrolysis, binding, inhibition, and inactivation with cephalosporinases from e.  cloacae gn7471 and c. freundii gn7391 were studied. bmy-28142 was much more stable against the both enzymes than cephalothin, but more hydrolyzable than cefotaxime and ceftazidime at higher concentration such as 100 microm. because of low affinity for the enzymes, i.e. large km and ki, the calculated hydrolysis rate of bmy-28142 at 0.1 microm was smaller than those of cefotaxime and ceftazidime, that explained the difference in activity against cephalosporinase-producing strains between bmy-28142 and cefotaxime or ceftazidime. the effects of cephalosporinase production on susceptibility of escherichia coli omp mutants were examined using a plasmid having cephalosporinase gene of c. freundii gn346. decrease in susceptibility of e. coli by cephalosporinase production was larger in the strain lacking outer membrane proteins (omp) f and c, and smaller in the strain producing ompf constitutively.

TI  == comparable evaluation of orally active beta-lactam compounds in ampicillin-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative rods: role of beta-lactamases on resistance.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of the recently developed cephems cefixime and cefetamet-pivoxyl was evaluated in 408 gram-positive and gram-negative rods, all  isolated recently from clinical specimens, and compared to that of other orally active agents such as ampicillin, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime-axetil and to ceftriaxone. with regard to ampicillin-resistant enterobacteriaceae ceftriaxone proved to be the most active agent, followed by cefixime and cefetamet, whereas cefuroxime was less active. cefaclor and amoxycillin + claculanic acid were active against ampicillin-resistant escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus ssp. isolates. all beta-lactam compounds exhibited poor activity against acinetobacter anitratus isolates, but were highly active against haemophilus influenzae with the exception of cefaclor. both cefixime and cefetamet were poorly active against staphylococcus aureus, but highly active against beta-hemolytic streptococci. moreover, both compounds remained unaffected by the production of plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases such as the tem or oxa enzymes. resistance to both agents was observed in enterobacteriaceae that produced large amounts of chromosomally mediated enzymes; their affinity to the class i enzyme from enterobacter cloacae was somewhat lower than that of other third-generation cephalosporins. however, in contrast with these agents breakdown of cefixime and  cefetamet by a class iiia enzyme form proteus vulgaris was marginal. in methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates there was a complete cross-resistance between all beta-lactam compounds included in this study.

TI  == activity of cefixime (fk 027) for resistant gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == cefixime is an orally absorbable cephalosporin with an extended spectrum of in vitro activity for gram-negative bacteria especially members of the enterobacteriaceae. gram-negative rod isolates collected over a three month period were tested against cefixime. greater than 99% of escherichia coli isolates was susceptible to cefixime including those resistant to ampicillin. similarly isolates of klebsiella, proteus and providencia were also exquisitely susceptible to cefixime as were 91% of enterobacter cloacae and 71% of enterobacter aerogenes. killing kinetics of cefixime did not differ from that of  the intravenously administered third-generation cephalosporin, cefotaxime. the addition of magnesium and calcium divalent cations or the lowering of the ph to 5.0 did not affect the action of this antibiotic. the extended spectrum of this oral antibiotic may be useful in treatment of urinary tract and skin and soft tissue infections caused by the more resistant gram-negative rods.

AB  == a total of 122 bacterial strains isolated from urine specimens of 113 female patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis were used for the study of beta-lactamase production and their susceptibility to various antimicrobial agents was determined. beta-lactamase activity was qualitatively determined by a  paper strip acidimetric method with benzylpenicillin as substrate and by chromogenic cephalosporin methods using pyridine-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline cephalosporin or nitrocefin as substrate. susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, including ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, cephalothin, gentamicin, minocycline, fosfomycin, pipemidic acid and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim was examined by a disc method. the beta-lactamase-producing strains detected by at least one of the three tests were found in 18 of 105 escherichia coli isolates and in the single strain of enterobacter cloacae dermidis, 3 enterococcus faecalis and 1 staphylococcus aureus produced beta-lactamase. the isolation rate  of strains resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin and cephalothin in the beta-lactamase-producing strains was significantly higher than that in the non-beta-lactamase-producing strains (p less than 0.01). these results suggest that beta-lactamase plays an important role in developing resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infection as well as complicated infection.

TI  == leakage of beta-lactamase: a second mechanism for antibiotic potentiation by amdinocillin.
AB  == discrepancies were observed between results of different beta-lactamase induction tests with amdinocillin, which appeared to be a strong inducer in whole-cell assays but a weak inducer in assays with cell-free sonic extracts. results of a nitrocephin-disk test with constitutive beta-lactamase producers indicated that the positive results obtained in whole-cell assays were due to drug-produced leakage of enzyme from the cell and not to induction. imipenem was also found to  cause leakage of beta-lactamase from a similar number of constitutive enzyme producers, while cefoxitin was much less likely to cause leakage. a split-dose regimen was employed to treat mice infected with a strain of enterobacter cloacae which appeared to leak enzyme on exposure to amdinocillin. results indicated that prior treatment with amdinocillin significantly enhanced (p less than 0.025) the  efficacy of azlocillin, an enzyme-labile drug, but did not affect the efficacy of cefotaxime, a relatively enzyme-stable drug. conversely, prior treatment with amdinocillin did not potentiate the efficacy of either azlocillin or cefotaxime in the treatment of mice infected with an escherichia coli strain that was highly susceptible to all three drugs. thus, it appears that amdinocillin may potentiate the activity of other beta-lactam drugs not only by binding to a complementary penicillin-binding protein but also by causing leakage of beta-lactamase from the cell. this effect may be related to its ability to bind to penicillin-binding protein 2 and subsequently produce changes in outer membrane permeability.

TI  == non-ige-dependent bacteria-induced histamine release from human lung and tonsillar mast cells.
AB  == a wide spectrum of formalin-killed bacteria have been tested for their ability to release histamine from human dispersed lung and tonsillar mast cells. escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella oxytoca and k. pneumoniae were the most effective histamine releasers. further studies on tonsillar mast cells showed that e. coli-induced histamine release differed from ige-dependent release with respect to its kinetics, temperature and ph profiles and its sensitivity to calcium deprivation and metabolic inhibitors. a lectin-mediated mechanism may operate, but other non-immunological mechanisms might also be involved in the release. escherichia coli and anti-ige did not synergize in inducing histamine release. the production of pgd2 and the failure to detect lactate dehydrogenase following incubation of mast cells with e. coli suggests that histamine release is not due to cytotoxicity.

TI  == coagglutination and enzyme capture tests for detection of escherichia coli beta-galactosidase, beta-glucuronidase, and glutamate decarboxylase.
AB  == polyclonal antibodies to escherichia coli beta-galactosidase, beta-glucuronidase, and glutamate decarboxylase were used in coagglutination tests for identification of these three enzymes in cell lysates. enzyme capture assays were also developed for the detection of e. coli beta-galactosidase and beta-glucuronidase. the enzymes were released by using a gentle lysis procedure that did not interfere with antibody-enzyme interactions. all three enzymes were detected in 93% (51 of  55) of the e. coli strains tested by coagglutination; two of the three enzymes were identified in the remaining 7%. of 42 non-e. coli tested by coagglutination, only four nonspecifically agglutinated either two or three of the anti-enzyme conjugates. thirty-two (76%) non-e. coli isolates were negative by coagglutination for all three enzymes. the enzyme capture assay detected the presence of beta-galactosidase in seven of eight and beta-glucuronidase in all eight strains of e. coli tested. some strains of beta-galactosidase-positive citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae were also positive by the enzyme capture assay, indicating that the antibodies were not entirely specific for e. coli beta-galactosidase; however, five other gas-positive non-e. coli isolates were negative by the enzyme capture assay. the coagglutination tests and enzyme capture assays were rapid and sensitive methods for the detection of e. coli beta-galactosidase, beta-glucuronidase, and glutamate decarboxylase.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of diethyldithiocarbamate and dimethyldithiocarbamate against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus has appeared which is highly resistant to both methicillin  and aminoglycosides. current therapy involves long-term intravenous therapy of vancomycin. since vancomycin is currently the only drug used to treat these patients, there is a need to develop additional antimicrobial therapy. the in vitro antimicrobial effect of the metal chelator, diethyldithiocarbamate (ddtc) and its structural analog dimethyldithiocarbamate (dmtc) were investigated. both  ddtc and dmtc were effective against s. aureus including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). by agar diffusion, ddtc at 10 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 12 to 21 mm and at 100 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 26 to  34 mm against mrsa. the dmtc produced slightly greater zone sizes against mrsa of 16 to 24 mm and 24 to 37 mm for 10 micrograms per disk and 100 micrograms per disk, respectively. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for dmtc against mrsa was 6 micrograms per ml. both ddtc and dmtc were also effective against enterococci, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, salmonella species, serratia marcescens and citrobacter freundii at 100 micrograms per disk. the mics of dmtc for klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, salmonella and citrobacter freundii were approximately 128 micrograms per ml while the mics for proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens was greater than or equal to 256 micrograms per ml. in addition, dmtc was synergistic with gentamicin against mrsa and coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. additive and synergistic effects of dmtc were displayed with gentamicin against s. aureus including methicillin-resistant  s. aureus.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == inactivation of the ampd gene causes semiconstitutive overproduction of the inducible citrobacter freundii beta-lactamase.
AB  == in citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae, synthesis of ampc beta-lactamase is inducible by the addition of beta-lactams to the growth medium. spontaneous mutants that constitutively overproduce the enzyme occur at a high frequency. when the c. freundii ampc beta-lactamase gene is cloned into escherichia coli together with the regulatory gene ampr, beta-lactamase expression from the clone is inducible. spontaneous cefotaxime-resistant mutants  were selected from an e. coli strain carrying the cloned c. freundii ampc and ampr genes on a plasmid. virtually all isolates had chromosomal mutations leading to semiconstitutive overproduction of beta-lactamase. the mutation ampd2 in one such mutant was caused by an is1 insertion into the hitherto unknown ampd gene, located between nadc and arop at minute 2.4 on the e. coli chromosome. the wild-type ampd allele cloned on a plasmid could fully trans-complement beta-lactamase-overproducing mutants of both e. coli and c. freundii, restoring the wild-type phenotype of highly inducible enzyme synthesis. this indicates that these e. coli and c. freundii mutants have their lesions in ampd. we hypothesize  that induction of beta-lactamase synthesis is caused by blocking of the ampd function by the beta-lactam inducer and that this leads directly or indirectly to an ampr-mediated stimulation of ampc expression.

TI  == a comparative study on the phoe genes of three enterobacterial species. implications for structure-function relationships in a pore-forming protein of the outer membrane.
AB  == the cloned phoe genes from enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae are normally expressed and regulated in escherichia coli k-12, and their products are correctly assembled into the outer membrane. differences between the three phoe proteins were found with binding of two out of ten monoclonal antibodies directed against the cell-surface-exposed part and in pore characteristics, but not in phage receptor function. the dna sequences of the e. cloacae and k. pneumoniae phoe genes were determined and used to predict the primary structures of the encoded proteins. in the upstream non-coding regions, which showed more variations among the three genes than the coding regions, conserved sequences were identified which might be involved in regulation of phoe gene expression. comparison of the predicted phoe primary structures revealed a high degree of homology, with 81% of the amino acid residues being identical in all three proteins. four small variable regions were found where differences are the most pronounced, corresponding to regions which were previously predicted to be exposed at the cell surface. implications of the sequence comparison for structure-function relationships in phoe protein are discussed.

AB  == thirty-nine samples of freshly drawn ewes' milk collected at 13 farms, and 120 samples of raw ewes' milk collected on arrival at a dairy were examined. farm samples had geometric mean counts of 4.4 x 10(2) enterobacteriaceae/ml, 3.9 x 10(2) coliforms/ml and 2.0 x 10(2) faecal coliforms/ml, whereas the respective mean counts were 6.2 x 10(3)/ml, 5.4 x 10(3)/ml and 1.3 x 10(3)/ml for dairy samples. salmonellas were not detected by enrichment procedures in any of the 159 samples examined. escherichia coli (47.5% strains), enterobacter cloacae (17.7%), ent. agglomerans (11.3%), hafnia alvei (6.5%) and klebsiella oxytoca (6.0%) were  the predominant species in 434 enterobacteriaceae strains isolated from farm samples. levels and species of enterobacteriaceae found in the present work in raw ewes' milk imply a considerable risk of early blowing in cheese-making from unpasteurized milk.

AB  == the in vitro activity of cgp 31608, a new penem, against aerobic and anaerobic organisms was evaluated and compared with those of other beta-lactams. cgp 31608  inhibited escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, and salmonella, shigella, aeromonas, and yersinia spp. with mics for 50% of the strains (mic50s) of 2 to 4 micrograms/ml and mic90s of 4 micrograms/ml, compared with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and imipenem mics of less than 0.25 microgram/ml. mic90s were 8 micrograms/ml for enterobacter species and c. freundii, for which other agents had mics of 32 micrograms/ml, except imipenem, which had equal activity. the mic90 for proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia stuartii, and providencia rettgeri was 8 micrograms/ml, compared with less than 2 micrograms/ml shown by the other agents. acinetobacter species resistant to other agents except imipenem were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml, as were pseudomonas aeruginosa, including piperacillin-, ceftazidime-, and gentamicin-resistant isolates. the mic for p. cepacia, p. fluorescens, and p. acidovorans was less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, but that for p. maltophilia was greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. hemolytic streptococci a, b, c, g, and f were inhibited by less than 1 micrograms/ml, but the mic for streptococcus faecalis was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. mics for staphylococcus aureus methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, as were those for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant s. epidermidis. bacteroides fragilis and clostridium species and fusobacterium spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. cgp 31608 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, pse-1, oxa-2, pse-4, or by s. aureus. chromosomal beta-lactamases of type ia in enterobacter cloacae p99 and morganella morganii, ic in p. vulgaris, k-1 in k. oxytoca, and id in p. aeruginosa also did not hydrolyze cgp 31608. it inhibited tem-1, but the 50% inhibitory concentration was 14.2 micrograms/ml compared with 0.15 micrograms/ml for the p99 enzyme. cgp 31608 induced beta-lactamases in p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae, c. freundii and providencia rettgeri, but there was no increase in mics for the isolates and it did not select strains derepressed for beta-lactamase production. synergy of cgp 31608 and gentamicin was found against 90% p. aeruginosa, 60% enterobacter cloacae, and 50% serratia marcescens strains. no synergy was found with rifampin. a postantibiotic effect was found against e. coli.

TI  == molecular genetic analysis of cephalosporinase production and its role in beta-lactam resistance in clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == two strains of enterobacter cloacae were isolated from a patient before (strain mhn1) and during (strain mhn2) treatment with moxalactam and gentamicin. strain mhn1 exhibited inducible ampc cephalosporinase production. in contrast, strain mhn2 expressed the enzyme constitutively at a 3,000-fold higher level. with the escherichia coli ampc gene as a hybridization probe it was shown that the genomic arrangement of the ampc region was the same in both strains. to gain more insight into regulatory phenomena, the ampc genes were cloned, and their expression was studied in e. coli k-12. the ampc gene from mhn1 behaved normally and conferred inducible beta-lactam resistance. a regulatory region of at least 800 base pairs  involved in controlling repression-induction was located immediately upstream of  ampc. surprisingly, when present in e. coli the ampc gene from mhn2 no longer overproduced the cephalosporinase, and inducible expression was observed. this indicates that in mhn2 stable cephalosporinase overproduction is controlled by another factor which is not linked to the ampc gene.

TI  == inducible cephalosporinase production in clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae is controlled by a regulatory gene that has been deleted from escherichia coli.
AB  == cephalosporin hyper-resistant enterobacter cloacae strains are isolated with increasing frequency from hospital infections. resistance is principally due to the chromosomal ampc gene encoding a cephalosporinase. in contrast to escherichia coli which expresses ampc constitutively from a promoter located in the upstream  frdd gene, e. cloacae displays inducible ampc expression. by cloning the ampc gene it was shown that a linked genetic locus, ampr, mediated the induction by beta-lactams. in the absence of the antibiotic the 30,500 dalton ampr protein represses ampc expression. the ampr gene shows a highly compact arrangement and is situated between the divergently expressed ampc gene and the frd operon from which it is separated by a bifunctional transcription terminator. the promoters for ampr and ampc substantially overlap and mrna analyses showed that on induction transcription from the ampc promoter increased greatly whereas that from ampr did not. two regions of sequence homology flank the ampr gene and it is proposed that a homologous recombination event between these in an ancestral enteric bacterium may have led to the deletion of ampr from the e. coli genome.

AB  == a commercial beta-glucuronidase (beta-gur) test for the rapid and economical identification of escherichia coli was evaluated. a total of 762 clinical strains and 228 environmental isolates were studied. more than 95% of the e. coli strains were found to be beta-gur positive. thirty-one clinical isolates of shigella sonnei, 10 of enterobacter cloacae, eight of enterobacter aerogenes, nine of citrobacter freundii and one of salmonella enteritidis also gave positive results. the enzyme beta-gur was also detected in two environmental strains of e. cloacae and one c. freundii. a comparative study between the beta-gur test and the conventional identification system was carried out in 233 consecutive isolates of lactose positive enterobacteria. agreement was observed in 223 cases  and 190 e. coli strains were correctly identified using this test. discrepancies  were found in 10 cases: nine e. coli were beta-gur negative and one c. freundii was beta-gur positive. escherichia coli was the only species positive for both beta-gur and indole tests. this procedure permits a rapid, easy, precise and inexpensive identification of e. coli. beta-gur positive enterobacter strains have not previously been described.

TI  == postantibiotic effect of imipenem on gram-positive and gram-negative micro-organisms.
AB  == the bactericidal effect (be) of an antibiotic reduces the infective population, and its postantibiotic effect (pae) assures a persistent inhibition of bacterial  cells after a short exposure to the antimicrobial agent. both effects prevent the early regrowth of the infecting organisms when the antibiotic tissue levels decrease to below the mic value. the be and the pae of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin, gentamicin and ampicillin on escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis were investigated with viable counts and continuous impedance monitoring of broth cultures. imipenem and gentamicin gave similar high be and pae values at low concentrations and with short drug exposures in most strains tested. pae is low or non-existent for gram-negative strains with other beta-lactam antibiotics. these results suggest the possibility of future clinical studies with new experimental dosage schedules for imipenem.

TI  == beta-lactamase stability of imipenem.
AB  == the beta-lactamase stability and interactions of imipenem were analysed in comparison with those of cefazolin, cefuroxime, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, mezlocillin, piperacillin and penicillin g for a set of representative beta-lactamases. these enzymes included penicillinases such as those obtained from staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and other enterobacteriaceae (tem-1 and similar enzymes) (group a); cephalosporinases produced by esch. coli (amp c type), serratia liquefaciens, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa (group b); and beta-lactamases produced by klebsiella spp., proteus vulgaris and bacteroides fragilis and with a high hydrolytic activity for the newer cephalosporins (group c). enzymes of group a were demonstrated to be highly active against penicillins and also against the early cephalosporins; enzymes of group b showed hydrolytic activity for all other tested compounds, including the newer cephalosporins and cephamycins, but not imipenem, whereas enzymes of group c were highly active against the new cephalosporins but not against cephamycins and imipenem. in conclusion, imipenem  shows a moderate affinity for all these enzymes but no detectable hydrolysis.

TI  == the effects on beta-lactam susceptibility of phenotypic induction and genotypic derepression of beta-lactamase synthesis.
AB  == we have compared the ability of beta-lactam antibiotics to induce beta-lactamase  synthesis and antagonize the in-vitro activity of other beta-lactams and also to  select mutants with derepressed beta-lactamase synthesis amongst representative gram-negative bacilli that produce inducible beta-lactamases. both imipenem and cefoxitin were potent inducers of beta-lactamase and were able to antagonize the  activity of other beta-lactams against isolates of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and pseudomonas aeruginosa when the two beta-lactams were present simultaneously. however, there was no antagonism for any compound against any of the organisms when the imipenem or cefoxitin was removed immediately before susceptibility to the other compounds was measured. cefotaxime was a less  potent inducer of beta-lactamase and failed to antagonize the activity of other compounds, even when present concurrently with them. neither imipenem nor cefoxitin induced beta-lactamase synthesis in a strain of escherichia coli, nor did they antagonize the activity of other beta-lactams against this strain. imipenem was compared with cefotaxime and cefoxitin as an agent for the selection of beta-lactam-resistant variants. resistant variants were obtained from isolates of ent. cloacae, c. freundii and p. aeruginosa when cefotaxime or cefoxitin was used as the selective agent. most of them synthesized beta-lactamase constitutively and showed reduced susceptibility to a wide range of beta-lactams, but not to imipenem. variants with reduced susceptibility to imipenem were obtained only from the two isolates of p. aeruginosa. they did not show cross resistance to other beta-lactams and were not distinguishable from the parent strains in beta-lactamase production.

TI  == beta-lactamase stability of cefpirome (hr 810), a new cephalosporin with a broad  antimicrobial spectrum.
AB  == cefpirome was highly stable to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases, although it was hydrolyzed to some extent by r plasmid-mediated penicillinase of richmond-sykes type va/b and by chromosomal cephalosporinases from bacteroides species. the compound had a very low affinity for cephalosporinases from enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, and proteus vulgaris. cefpirome showed strong antimicrobial activity against eight beta-lactamase (cephalosporinase)-producing strains which have become resistant to broad-spectrum cephalosporins; especially against e. cloacae and c. freundii,  it had the highest activity among the cephalosporins used. its activity against ampicillin-resistant r plasmid-containing transconjugant isolates of escherichia  coli was as high as that against the recipient strain e. coli chi 1037. the inducer activity of cefpirome in s. marcescens and p. vulgaris increased dose dependently, whereas cephamycin derivatives showed high inducer activity at low concentrations. a relatively low affinity of cefpirome for beta-lactamases is considered to be one of the reasons for its high antimicrobial activity against such enzyme-producing strains. in addition, other factors such as good penetration through the outer membrane and affinity for the target sites may also be involved in the high activity of cefpirome.

AB  == during the summer and fall of 1984, elevated total coliform counts were observed  in the distribution system of a public water supply serving 350,000 people in south central connecticut. as part of an investigation of possible health risks associated with the presence of bacteria in the water supply, bacterial isolates  from the distribution system were compared with bacterial isolates of the same species obtained from a large regional teaching hospital and from a national compendium of clinical isolates. characteristics analyzed included phenotypic metabolic activity, antimicrobial susceptibilities to clinically utilized antibiotics, temperature tolerance at 44.5 degrees c, and beta-glucuronidase activity in single-test form and on a selective medium. environmental isolates lacked known plasmid-mediated characteristics, with the exception of one escherichia coli isolate which showed some antibiotic resistance. klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and enterobacter agglomerans from all sources were temperature tolerant and yielded positive fecal coliform tests. only e. coli showed beta-glucuronidase activity (both in a single biochemical test and on a selective medium). no single characteristic analyzed was sufficient to establish an organism as either environmental or clinical in origin.

TI  == novel plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase in members of the family enterobacteriaceae from ohio.
AB  == epidemiologic studies of plasmid-mediated resistance at the cleveland veterans administration medical center revealed that related plasmids had disseminated among members of the family enterobacteriaceae. we studied the beta-lactamases encoded by these plasmids in escherichia coli c600 transformants or transconjugants. substrate and inhibition profiles of the enzymes determined by two of these plasmids suggested an activity resembling tem-1; however, isoelectric focusing revealed a pi of 7.0. these two plasmids were originally found in a serratia marcescens (pds076) and an enterobacter cloacae (pds075) strain isolated from the same sink in the medical intensive care unit and later,  in an enterobacter cloacae (pds142 identical to pds076) isolate colonizing a patient in the same unit. the plasmids also carried the aminoglycoside resistance determinant, 2"-aminoglycoside nucleotidyl transferase. a 2-kilobase avai restriction endonuclease digestion fragment of psd075 known to carry the beta-lactamase determinant was used as a molecular probe. this probe did not recognize sequences of any plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase tested including the recently described determinants rob-1, tle-1, and oxa-4-7. a tem-1 probe derived  from the 0.7-kilobase psti-ecori fragment of pbr322 failed to recognize the new beta-lactamase gene. four additional enterobacter cloacae and two enterobacter aerogenes strains isolated in columbus, ohio, have been shown to produce a pi 7.0 beta-lactamase and to carry plasmids recognized by the 2-kilobase probe. these data suggest dissemination of a novel plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase among members of the family enterobacteriaceae in ohio and demonstrate the development  and utility of a molecular probe for the new determinant. we suggest that the novel beta-lactamase be named ohio-1.

TI  == combination therapy: a way to limit emergence of resistance?
AB  == the ability of antibiotic combinations to limit the emergence of resistance during therapy was evaluated in a murine model. peritonitis was produced by injecting a mixture containing 10(8) colony-forming units of bacteria and sterilized talcum into the peritoneum. two hours later, a single antibiotic dose  was administered subcutaneously. the next day, peritoneal bacterial populations were analyzed on szybalski's gradients. acquired resistance was recorded when there was at least a fourfold increase in minimum inhibitory concentrations compared with untreated animals. no resistance emerged after amikacin monotherapy (15 mg/kg); however, resistance was frequently observed after monotherapy with ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg) or pefloxacin (25 mg/kg). resistance to ceftriaxone and pefloxacin emerged, respectively, in 15 percent and 83 percent of animals with klebsiella pneumoniae, 71 percent and 54 percent with enterobacter cloacae, 0 percent and 83 percent with serratia marcescens, 25 percent and 100 percent with  pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 0 percent with both escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. in mice with k. pneumoniae or e. cloacae infections, any dual combination of amikacin, pefloxacin, and ceftriaxone produced less acquired  resistance than did monotherapy. in these animals, the combination of ceftriaxone and pefloxacin abolished all resistance, whereas the combinations of amikacin plus ceftriaxone or amikacin plus pefloxacin reduced the frequency of resistance  by more than half. in animals with p. aeruginosa or s. marcescens infections, resistance to pefloxacin diminished or disappeared after treatment with the combinations of pefloxacin plus ceftriaxone or pefloxacin plus amikacin. however, combinations with ceftriaxone resulted in more frequent resistance to ceftriaxone than did ceftriaxone alone. this was the case in p. aeruginosa infections treated with ceftriaxone plus amikacin (p less than 0.01), and in s. marcescens infections treated with ceftriaxone plus pefloxacin (p less than 0.05). despite these certain notable exceptions, our data confirm that in most cases combination therapy does limit the emergence of resistance.

TI  == qualitative and quantitative aspects of beta-lactamase production as mechanisms of beta-lactam resistance in a survey of clinical isolates from faecal samples.
AB  == a study has been conducted to identify the beta-lactamases most likely to contribute to beta-lactam resistance in clinical populations and to investigate their interactions with cefuroxime and newer cephalosporins. a total of 217 ampicillin-resistant, gram-negative isolates from faecal samples of healthy volunteers in germany, south america and amman were investigated. such strains represent the 'gene pool' from which infections might arise. escherichia coli was the prevalent species (59.9%) followed by klebsiella spp. (20.3%) and enterobacter cloacae (12.0%). at least 56.7% and possibly as high as 64.5% of strains owed their principal beta-lactamase activity to enzymes mediated by r-plasmids. the most prevalent r-plasmid mediated beta-lactamase was tem-1 which  was produced by 109 strains. the beta-lactamase activity of strains producing only a chromosomal enzyme was often markedly higher than that of strains also producing an r-plasmid mediated enzyme. the qualitative and quantitative aspects  of beta-lactamase production were investigated in cell free and whole cell tests  and this confirmed the superior broad spectrum beta-lactamase resistance of ceftazidime over other new cephalosporins.

AB  == strains of escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae that were resistant to ceftazidime (mic greater than 16 micrograms/ml) but susceptible to bmy 28142 (mic less than 4 micrograms/ml) were found to contain higher levels of beta-lactamase activity (50- to 3,340-fold) than control strains of the corresponding species. ceftazidime was at least as resistant as bmy 28142  to hydrolysis by these enzymes. however, the apparent ki of bmy 28142 for each enzyme was larger (8- to greater than 20-fold) than that of ceftazidime; i.e., the affinity of these enzymes for bmy 28142 appeared to be lower than that for ceftazidime. thus, bmy 28142 was affected less than ceftazidime by a mechanism of resistance that depends, at least in part, on the relative affinities of cephalosporins for the beta-lactamases of these species. these results indicate that the affinity between a beta-lactamase and a cephalosporin may be a distinguishing factor in the evaluation of beta-lactamase-resistant cephalosporins and suggest that affinity can play a major role in susceptibility  to highly beta-lactamase-resistant cephalosporins.

TI  == transfer of amikacin resistance by closely related plasmids in members of the family enterobacteriaceae isolated in chile.
AB  == during a 9-month period when amikacin was the sole aminoglycoside used clinically in a hospital in santiago, chile, resistance to amikacin and other antibiotics was encountered in 42 strains of the family enterobacteriaceae, including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and serratia liquefaciens. amikacin resistance was  transferable by conjugation and carried by incm plasmids ranging in size from ca. 48.4 to 58.1 kilobase pairs. the plasmids had ca. 70 to 80% of their structure in common, as judged after digestion with restriction endonucleases. the resistance  was mediated by a 6' aminoglycoside acetyltransferase. we conclude that selective pressure has favored the dissemination of a wide-host-range amikacin resistance plasmid and its derivatives.

TI  == cloning and characterization of chromosomally encoded cephalosporinase gene of enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == the cephalosporinase gene, cpa, which codes for an inducible class i chromosomal  beta-lactamase in enterobacter cloacae was cloned on a fragment of 6.05 kilobase  pairs inserted into plasmid pacyc184 and transferred into escherichia coli hb101  recipient cells. the constructed hybrid plasmid, designated pggq101, carried a genomic fragment which retained its parental inducibility characteristics, although its expression level in transformed e. coli cells fell to 40-65% of its  initial level in e. cloacae. the localization of the cpa gene on pggq101 plasmid  was determined by bal31 exonuclease deletion mapping and further confirmed by subcloning hindiii-avai restriction fragment on pmb9 plasmid vector. labeling with [35s]methionine of pggq101 specified proteins in a minicell system showed that six or seven proteins are encoded by the insert. two proteins with apparent  molecular mass of 42 000 and 39 500 daltons, respectively, most probably represent the premature and mature cephalosporinase forms.

TI  == studies on microbial quality of filtered water in households of a university community in nigeria.
AB  == water samples from home filters in nine residential areas of a nigerian university community were studied. the membrane filter technique was used to determine the total coliform and faecal coliform counts/100 ml of water. most of  the 100 samples studied were grossly contaminated with total coliform counts/100  ml ranging from 0-442, faecal coliform counts/100 ml, 0-216 and the total aerobic plate count per millilitre ranged from 3.0 x 10(3) to 1.9 x 10(9) c.f.u. the source (dams) of water, fitness of filter candles, frequency of cleaning candles  and ph of water did not significantly (p greater than 0.05; chi2) affect the microbial quality of either filtered boiled or unboiled tap water. escherichia coli type i was isolated from 17.9% of the faecal coliforms tested but from only  2.3% of total coliforms. enterobacter aerogenes was most predominant (38.5%) amongst faecal coliforms isolated while enterobacter cloacae was the most frequent (37.2%) of the total coliform isolates. the gross contamination of filtered water from all households sampled calls for an enlightenment of residents on the proper use of home water filters.

TI  == in-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to other antibiotics.
AB  == pefloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. a comparison was made of the in-vitro activity of pefloxacin and that of nine other antibiotics (ampicillin, ticarcillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin, amikacin and norfloxacin). the mic90 of pefloxacin against 500 strains of enterobacteriaceae ranged from 0.25 mg/l (escherichia coli, indole + proteus spp., enterobacter cloacae, salmonella spp. and shigella spp.) to 1 mg/l (klebsiella pneumoniae). pefloxacin inhibited 90% of 52 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa at 2.5 mg/l (range 0.25 mg/l-4 mg/l). the mic90 of pefloxacin against 100 staphylococcus aureus strains (78 oxacillin resistant strains) was 0.4 mg/l (range 0.12-0.5 mg/l). it was markedly less active against streptococcus faecalis and str. pneumoniae (37 strains of each species) the mic90 being 4 mg/l against both species. overall, pefloxacin was at least as active as the third-generation cephalosporins against enterobacteriaceae and was more active than any other antibiotic tested against p. aeruginosa, s. epidermidis, and s. aureus. against e. coli, pefloxacin had a more rapid anti-bacterial activity than piperacillin. a paradoxical effect was observed with pefloxacin. an optimal killing rate was observed at concentrations of pefloxacin compatible with those one can expect in  blood of patients treated with this drug.

AB  == ciprofloxacin's in vitro activity was tested against 385 hospital isolates originating from three geographically distinct regions. of all strains tested, only three (1 acinetobacter sp. and 2 pseudomonas aeruginosa) were ciprofloxacin  resistant. ciprofloxacin was more active against escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, acinetobacter sp., proteus sp., shigella sp. than gentamicin, mezlocillin and cefotaxime. it was more active than azlocillin and cefsulodin against p. aeruginosa. it was more active than cloxacillin and cefamandole against staphylococci. it was as active as cefotaxime against klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens. ciprofloxacin demonstrated similar activity in broth and solid agar. the minimal  inhibitory concentrations (mic's) of all strains were similar to the minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc's). ciprofloxacin's mic was not influenced by increase of the inoculum or addition of human serum and only slightly influenced  by anaerobic conditions. decrease of the medium ph increased the mic substantially. ciprofloxacin exhibited a rapid bactericidal effect and had only a minimal post-antibiotic effect. these favorable in vitro characteristics of ciprofloxacin warrant further studies.

AB  == a murine model of peritonitis allowing detection and quantification of in-vivo acquired resistance during short term therapy has been used in order to evaluate  the capacity of antimicrobial combinations to limit emergence of resistance, as compared to individual components of the regimens. mice were challenged intraperitoneally with 10(8) cfu of bacteria. two hours later, a single antibiotic dose was injected subcutaneously: amikacin (15 mg/kg), ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg), pefloxacin (25 mg/kg), amikacin + ceftriaxone, amikacin + pefloxacin or ceftriaxone + pefloxacin. escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus never became resistant. single drug therapy yielded resistant mutants in enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa as follows: 74% of ceftriaxone-treated animals, 57% of pefloxacin treated animals and 27% of  amikacin treated animals. all the tested combinations reduced the frequency of in-vivo acquired resistance produced by single drugs, and no combination selected resistance when the separate agents of the combination did not. combining antimicrobial agents limits the risk of emergence of resistance during antibiotic therapy.

TI  == defence reactions of glossina morsitans morsitans against different species of bacteria and trypanosoma brucei brucei.
AB  == tsetse flies, glossina morsitans morsitans, fed on rats infected with trypanosoma brucei brucei showed wide fluctuations in total and differential haemocyte counts. similar fluctuations occurred in controls fed on non-infected rats and also between the two groups without showing any difference which could be attributed to the infection. trypanosome infection of the tsetse haemocoel occurred in 16.25% of the flies, starting from the second day after feeding on the infected rats, but salivary glands and proboscis became infected only after the eleventh day. about 2% of bloodstream forms of t. b. brucei injected into tsetse haemocoels completed their developmental cycle successfully. injection of  tsetse homogenates into teneral g. m. morsitans prior to exposure to trypanosome-infected feed increased t. b. brucei infections in the flies significantly. injection of live escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and acinetobacter calcoaceticus into tsetse induced a remarkable increase in two pre-existing haemolymph proteins with molecular weights of about 70 and 17 kilodaltons, while live bacillus subtilis and micrococcus luteus induced a very weak response or sometimes none at all. t. b. brucei also failed to induce any increase in these proteins. inoculation of g. m. morsitans with live e. coli und  t. b. brucei prior to feeding on trypanosome-infected rats had no effect on the salivary gland and proboscis infection rates by t. b. brucei. injection of live t. b. brucei into the haemocoels of tsetse caused no change in total haemocyte counts, but the trypanosomes disappeared from the haemolymph so rapidly that by 48 h post-injection, only about 1% were left.

TI  == opportunistic infections in hysterectomy-derived, barrier-maintained guinea pigs.
AB  == guineapigs were rederived by hysterectomy and associated with a colonization-resistant enteric microflora (crf) of mouse origin to establish a strict barrier-maintained breeding colony. infections were suspected in 55 of 209 animals autopsied. from 65 of 67 tissue samples selected for bacteriological examination 167 isolates, belonging to 16 usually non-pathogenic bacterial species or groups, were isolated mostly from cases of mastitis, typhlitis, enteritis, otitis media and pneumonia. faecal streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium perfringens, citrobacter spp., c. freundii, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca and enterobacter cloacae accounted for 86.8% of all isolates. variations in the recovery rate of these 8 species during the study and a gradual decline in the incidence of infections were observed. elimination by rederivation of the autochthonous bacterial flora seemed to have predisposed to opportunistic infections by aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria. enteric colonization resistance to the growth of these bacteria was presumably insufficiently provided by the crf of mouse origin and might be remedied by using a flora of guineapig origin.

TI  == chromosomal beta-lactam resistance in enterobacteria.
AB  == most enterobacterial species carry a chromosomal ampc beta-lactamase gene. in escherichia coli and shigella, expression from ampc is non-inducible and the beta-lactamase is synthesized at low levels. mutations leading to increased beta-lactamase synthesis occur rather infrequently, making resistance to modern cephalosporins a rare event in these species. in other enterobacteria and pseudomonas, ampc beta-lactamase synthesis is induced by beta-lactams. in enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and probably also in other species with inducible beta-lactamase expression, ampc is regulated by at least two genes, ampr and ampd. mutations affecting ampr abolish beta-lactamase inducibility, and mutants devoid of ampr, produce ampc beta-lactamase at low constitutive levels. mutations in ampd lead to constitutive overproduction of inducible beta-lactamase if an intact ampr protein is present in the cell. the latter type of mutations occur at a high frequency and result in clinical resistance to several third-generation cephalosporins.

(1) unchanged medium: escherichia coli, shigella spp., yersinia spp., hafnia alvei and morganella morganii 100% each, klebsiella spp., 50%, enterobacter cloacae 37%, proteus vulgaris 59%, acinetobacter spp. 42%, pseudomonas fluorescens 19%, some other bacteria 2-12%. (2) rusty-brown slant, unchanged butt: salmonella subgenera ii, iii and iv 98%, citrobacter freundii 65%, e. cloacae 55%, p. vulgaris 41%, proteus mirabilis 98%, providencia rettgeri 100%, urease-negative providencia 96%, acinetobacter spp. 58%, pseudomonas aeruginosa 100%, p. fluorescens 81%, ufp (unclassified fluorescent pseudomonads)  100%, other pseudomonas spp. 55%. (3) unchanged slant, brown butt: s. typhi 88%,  salmonella subgenus i 3%, klebsiella spp. 31%, some other bacteria 2-3%. (4) rusty-brown slant, brown butt: salmonella subgenus i 75%, c. freundii 20%, klebsiella spp. 12%, some other bacteria 1-5%. colour reactions in ferric ammonium citrate agar are associated with the accumulation of ferric hydroxide: bacteria giving positive reactions on the slant took up as an average, 63 times more iron than those with negative test. the localization of colour reaction correlated partly with aerobic and anaerobic citrate utilization or decomposition in simmons' minimal and in kauffmann's peptone water medium.

TI  == population analysis of susceptibility to cefotaxime in enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == population analysis of susceptibility to cefotaxime (ctx) in eight species of enterobacteriaceae was carried out. one strain of each species was examined. the  strains represented their individual species as regards natural susceptibility to ampicillin (a) and carbenicillin (ca). cephalothinase activity of the parental strains and strains selected on the plates with the highest concentration that allowed growth was determined by an ultraviolet assay. the populations of the a-susceptible/ca-susceptible (a-s/ca-s) species, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis were homogeneous as regards susceptibility to ctx. the a-resistant/ca-resistant (a-r/ca-r) species, klebsiella oxytoca and citrobacter koseri, were less homogeneous, but in all four mentioned species no increase in cephalothinase activity was observed between the parental strains and the strains selected in the population analysis. the four a-r/ca-s species, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii, were heterogeneous. the frequency of ctx-r mutants was approx. 10(-6.5). the ic50 for  ctx was 2(7.5)-2(8.5) times higher for the mutants than for the parental strains. the ctx resistance was maintained in subcultures of the strains. all four species had a very high increase in cephalothinase activity from parental strains to the  strains selected in the population analysis. only the enzyme of proteus vulgaris  was able to hydrolyze ctx.

TI  == in vitro activities of the quinolone antimicrobial agents a-56619 and a-56620.
AB  == the in vitro activities of two new quinolone antimicrobial agents, a-56619 and a-56620, were compared with those of norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and other antimicrobial agents. the activity of a-56620 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, and aeromonas hydrophila (mics for 90% of the strains were less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml); acinetobacter anitratus and staphylococcus aureus (mic for 90% of the strains was 0.5 micrograms/ml); and most streptococci. against other gram-negative strains, a-56620 demonstrated activity comparable to that of norfloxacin, but the new drug was two to eight times more active than norfloxacin against gram-positive isolates. a-56620 was more active than a-56619 against most gram-negative organisms tested. of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae examined, 88% were inhibited by a-56619 and 99% by a-56620 at concentrations of less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml. by time-kill methods, the new quinolones  were bactericidal against gram-negative bacilli during the first 6 h of incubation, but against s. aureus and enterococci the drugs were primarily bacteriostatic during this period. the frequency of spontaneous resistance to 10  micrograms of these drugs per ml was less than 10(-8) for all species tested except e. cloacae, but by serial passage through incremental concentrations of the antimicrobial agents, colonies many-fold more resistant than the initial isolate could be selected. however, resistance to concentrations of the drug greater than 100 micrograms/ml remained stable after passage on antibiotic-free media in only 1 of 35 strains tested.

AB  == of nine hundred ampicillin resistant (amp-r) enterobacteria strains, isolated in  hospital between july and december 1981, 73,7% are also carbenicillin-resistant (carb-r). this particular double resistance varies depending upon the species considered: indole positive proteus (23%), enterobacter cloacae (64%), citrobacter freundii (67%), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (73%), proteus mirabilis  (75%), serratia marcescens (90%), escherichia coli (91%), providencia stuartii (96%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (100%). the biochemical and genetic basis of resistance to beta-lactamines was studied in 27 strains belonging to these 9 species. a constitutive beta-lactamase was found in all the strains. these enzymes were identified by determination of the isoelectric point on crude sonic  extracts, the enzymic activity profile, the inhibition by clavulanic acid and cloxacillin of enzyme activity. two types of enzymes were predominant: tem-1 (20  strains) and tem-2 (7 strains); two strains of klebsiella pneumoniae produced both shv-1 and tem-1. the transfer by conjugation to e. coli k12 of ampicillin and carbenicillin resistance was obtained with 14 strains: (e. coli: 9, c. freundii: 1, k. pneumoniae: 1, e. cloacae: 2, p. stuartii: 1). in all strains but one e. coli we noted the co-transfer of other antibiotic resistance markers.

AB  == forty-one isolates of multiply resistant gram-negative bacteria causing infection in a urological unit of a dublin hospital were collected during a 6-month period. twenty-one isolates transferred multiple resistance to an escherichia coli k-12 recipient in liquid matings. serratia marcescens, proteus morganii, proteus vulgaris, and e. coli isolates harbored similar 120-megadalton incc plasmids, whereas enterobacter cloacae strains transferred a 160-megadalton plasmid of a different inc group. southern hybridization experiments were performed with purified fragments cloned from one incc plasmid as probes. they were hybridized to plasmid sequences in total cellular dna extracts, showing that the incc plasmids were very closely related. this suggests that the same plasmid has transferred to different bacterial species in the hospital environment.

TI  == cefadroxil in the horse: pharmacokinetics and in vitro antibacterial activity.
AB  == sodium cefadroxil was administered as a single intravenous dose (25 mg/kg) to six healthy adult mares. plasma samples were collected over a 24-h period and cefadroxil concentrations were measured by microbiological assay. the pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug was appropriately described in terms of a one-compartment open model. values for the major pharmacokinetic terms were: extrapolated initial plasma concentration = 59.2 +/- 15.0 micrograms/ml; half-life = 46 +/- 20 min; apparent volume of distribution = 462 +/- 191 ml/kg; and body clearance = 7.0 +/- 0.6 ml/min.kg. in a subsequent study, a suspension of cefadroxil monohydrate was administered intragastrically (25 mg/kg) to the same six horses. plasma concentrations of the drug peaked at 1-2 h but, in general, absorption was both poor and inconsistent. the data were unsuitable for  determination of cefadroxil bioavailability from this oral dosage form. ninety-nine isolates of eleven bacterial species obtained from clinically ill horses were tested for susceptibility to cefadroxil. all strains of streptococcus equi, streptococcus zooepidemicus, coagulase-positive staphylococci, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and five out of six strains of actinobacillus  suis were highly susceptible to the drug (mic less than 4 micrograms/ml). escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella sp. showed intermediate susceptibility (mic 4-16 micrograms/ml), while all isolates of corynebacterium (rhodococcus) equi, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa proved to be  highly resistant to cefadroxil (mic greater than 128 micrograms/ml).

AB  == following growth in a subinhibitory concentration of imipenem and additional incubation in a 20% dilution of normal human serum (nhs) for 90 minutes, five of  12 serum-resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae showed a decrease in colony-forming units of two or more logs of growth compared with the control. two strains (of escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes) showed this phenomenon even with incubation in 5% nhs. treatment with imipenem did not change the serum  resistance of the other seven strains (two strains each of enterobacter cloacae,  klebsiella pneumonia, and serratia marcescens, and one strain of proteus morganii). the phenomenon of induced serum susceptibility is dose dependent and reversible. other beta-lactam antibiotics either caused only a slight decrease of resistance (cefsulodin, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefodizime-hr221) or did not influence the serum resistance at all (cefotaxime, mecillinam). killing of the induced serum-sensitive strains appeared to be antibody dependent.

AB  == by means of a micro-dilution technique (10(5) cfu/cup) 30 strains of pseudomonas  spp. were found resistant to sch 34343. the susceptibility of acinetobacter spp.  (20 strains) was greatest for imipenem, followed by sch 34343 (mic approximately  0.7 mg/l), ceftazidime and ceftriaxone. ten moraxella strains were very susceptible to sch 34343, imipenem and ceftazidime. for 35 strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae (ten beta-lactamase-positive) and ten strains of n. meningitidis we noted no resistance to sch 34343 (mic 0.015-0.06 mg/l), or to any of the other drugs tested. sixty-two strains of enterobacteriaceae producing various beta-lactamases were tested for their sensitivity to sch 34343 and seven other beta-lactams. to an even greater extent than imipenem and sch 34343, latamoxef and ceftazidime proved very active against all these strains. a pse-4-producing escherichia coli strain was resistant to sch 34343. the inoculum effect (10(6) vs 10(4) cfu/ml) on sch 34343 activity was usually small (1-4). tests for the beta-lactamase susceptibility of sch 34343 showed that only one pse-3, one pse-4  and one chromosomal beta-lactamase from a strain of enterobacter cloacae were slightly active.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of the penem sch 34343 was assessed in comparison with third-generation cephalosporins, aztreonam and imipenem. sch 34343 was active, with mics generally 2 mg/1 or less, against a broad spectrum of organisms amongst which were staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), streptococci  (though enterococci were less susceptible with sch 34343 mics mostly 4-8 mg/1), anaerobes (including the bacteroides fragilis group), haemophilus influenzae and  neisseria gonorrhoeae. it was also active against the enterobacteriaceae though enterobacter cloacae and serratia spp. were somewhat less susceptible than other  members of this group. sch 34343 lacked useful activity against most species of pseudomonas (including ps. aeruginosa) but was active against ps. acidovorans and some isolates of ps. cepacia. sch 34343 showed a high degree of resistance to plasmid-determined and most chromosomally-determined beta-lactamases; however, it was hydrolysed rapidly by enzymes from some isolates of aeromonas hydrophila and  more slowly by enzymes from ps. maltophilia and bact. melaninogenicus subspecies  intermedius. we did not observe any reduction in sensitivity to sch 34343 for most beta-lactamase-producing organisms, including strains of enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii that were resistant to most other beta-lactams.

TI  == role of beta-lactam hydrolysis in the mechanism of resistance of a beta-lactamase-constitutive enterobacter cloacae strain to expanded-spectrum beta-lactams.
AB  == enterobacter cloacae strains producing chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase constitutively show high degrees of resistance to most of the third-generation beta-lactams. it has been proposed that this resistance is due to the nonhydrolytic binding or trapping of beta-lactams by the enzyme. we found that the outer membrane of e. cloacae strain 55m indeed had permeability to cefazolin  about 14-fold lower than that of escherichia coli, and that the number of beta-lactamase molecules produced by this constitutive mutant was exceptionally large (2 x 10(5) per cell). these conditions are expected to produce a low degree of resistance, but could not explain the high resistance level of the mutant. we  showed that the beta-lactamase of this strain hydrolyzed third-generation beta-lactams at measurable rates. although the v max for these compounds was less than 0.01% of that for cefazolin, the enzyme could hydrolyze them at rates comparable to the rate for cefazolin when the substrate concentration was near 0.1 microm, a concentration thought to be physiologically relevant for the inhibition of cell growth, because of the exceptionally high affinity of the enzyme to many third-generation compounds. calculations based on kinetic parameters of the enzyme, outer membrane permeability, and affinity toward penicillin-binding proteins succeeded in predicting the mics for several third-generation beta-lactams. the data suggest that hydrolysis may be more important than nonhydrolytic binding for the expression of the resistant phenotype, and that studies on the susceptibility of beta-lactams to beta-lactamases should be carried out at physiologically relevant, very low concentrations of the drug, rather than the customary very high concentrations, such as 100 microm.

AB  == the protein exoproducts released during exponential growth of gram-negative bacteria were analysed and compared by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel  electrophoresis (sds-page). the following bacterial strains were tested: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, serratia liquefaciens, serratia rubidaea, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, salmonella minnesota, pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas fluorescens. it is demonstrated by sds-page that members of one species show identical protein pattern, whereas different species show besides comparable protein bands a species characteristic pattern. all members of enterobacteriaceae were shown to release proteins whose molecular weights fell into the following size regions: each strain was shown to synthesize a polypeptide of molecular weight 34,000 and one or more polypeptides within the molecular weight range 25,000-29,000. this profile was shown to be clearly different from that of pseudomonas strains where 20 or more distinct polypeptides ranging from 12,500 to 160,000 mr were detectable.

AB  == both enterobacter cloacae h478 and klebsiella edwardsii s15 were shown to harbour a relatively large conjugative plasmid that coded for cloacin df13-susceptibility and the production and uptake of a hydroxamate iron chelator, most probably aerobactin. protein-blotting experiments with antiserum raised against the purified cloacin df13/aerobactin receptor protein from escherichia coli (co1v-k30) revealed that the corresponding outer membrane receptor proteins of ent. cloacae h478 and k. edwardsii s15 had apparent mol wts of 85 000 and 76 000, respectively. e. coli transconjugants harbouring either the plasmid from ent. cloacae h478 or k. edwardsii s15 expressed a cloacin df13/aerobactin outer membrane receptor protein with a mol wt of 74 000. the receptor protein encoded by the ent. cloacae and k. edwardsii plasmids were immunologically more related to each other than to the pco1v-k30-encoded receptor protein.

AB  == escherichia fergusonii (formerly known as enteric group 10) and enterobacter taylorae (formerly known as enteric group 19) are proposed as new species in the  family enterobacteriaceae. by dna hybridization (32p, 60 degrees c, hydroxyapatite), strains of e. fergusonii were 90 to 97% related to the type strain (holotype) atcc 35469. they were most closely related to escherichia coli  and more distantly related to species in other genera. e. fergusonii strains are  positive for indole production, methyl red, lysine decarboxylase, ornithine decarboxylase, and motility. they ferment d-glucose with gas production and also  ferment adonitol, l-arabinose, l-rhamnose, maltose, d-xylose, trehalose, cellobiose, and d-arabitol. they are negative for voges-proskauer, citrate utilization (17% positive), urea hydrolysis, phenylalanine deamination, arginine  dihydrolase, growth in kcn, and fermentation of lactose, sucrose, myo-inositol, d-sorbitol, raffinose, and alpha-methyl-d-glucoside. by dna hybridization (32p, 60 degrees c, hydroxyapatite), strains of e. taylorae were 84 to 95% related to the type strain (holotype) atcc 35317. their nearest relative was e. cloacae, to  which they were 61% related. other named species were more distantly related. strains of e. taylorae are positive for voges-proskauer, citrate utilization, arginine dihydrolase, ornithine decarboxylase, motility, growth in kcn medium, and malonate utilization. they ferment d-glucose with gas production and also ferment d-mannitol, l-arabinose, l-rhamnose, maltose, d-xylose, trehalose, and cellobiose. they are negative for indole production, methyl red, h2s production on triple sugar-iron agar, urea hydrolysis, phenylalanine deamination, lysine decarboxylase, gelatin hydrolysis, and fermentation of adonitol, i-inositol, d-sorbitol, and raffinose. both new species occur in human clinical specimens. two strains of e. fergusonii were isolated from blood. five stains of e. taylorae were isolated from blood, and one was from spinal fluid. these blood and spinal fluid isolates suggest possible clinical significance, but this point requires further study.

TI  == affinity of carumonam for penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  == direct labeling experiments with [14c]-carumonam as well as competition binding assays with [14c]-benzylpenicillin and [14c]-ceftriaxone have demonstrated that penicillin-binding protein (pbp) 3 of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and  pseudomonas aeruginosa has the highest affinity for carumonam (ro 17-2301, ama-1080). pbp 1a is inhibited only at significantly higher concentration whereas other pbps display poor affinity. the ic50 values for binding to pbp 3 in e. coli and e. cloacae are in the range of the mic-values (0.1-0.4 micrograms/ml), whereas those for p. aeruginosa are much lower than the mic obtained in vitro. in accordance with the pbp affinity pattern observed for carumonam, filament formation resulted after exposure to concentrations greater than 1/2 mic. although pbp 1 and 2 of staphylococcus aureus could be titrated with radioactive  carumonam, very high concentrations were required and in line with the poor affinity for all four pbps in s. aureus, this organism is resistant to carumonam.

TI  == temocillin treatment of serious infections due to gram-negative bacilli in an intensive care unit.
AB  == in a group of 27 severely ill patients in an intensive care unit, 40 infections caused by gram-negative bacilli were treated with temocillin 2g twice daily by the direct intravenous route. the patients (17 men and 10 women) were aged from 35 to 93 years (mean 65.7 years) and 22 had severe underlying diseases. in addition, 10 of the patients were admitted to the intensive care unit following surgery; 6 had acute renal insufficiency, 5 had acute respiratory insufficiency,  and 12 were suffering from infectious shock. the infections included septicaemia  (19), urinary tract infection (10), respiratory tract infection (4) and biliary tract infection (4). the most frequent bacterial isolate was escherichia coli (14), followed by enterobacter cloacae (5), proteus spp. (5) and klebsiella pneumoniae (4). the initial pathogens were eliminated in 34/40 infections (85%) and the corresponding clinical cure rate was 60%, with a further 27.5% of patients being improved. in the septicaemic patients, 17/19 pathogens were eradicated from the blood, while clinically, 12 patients were cured and 5 were improved. eight of the 10 urinary tract pathogens were eliminated, with 6 patients being clinically cured and a further 3 being improved. all of the initial pathogens in both biliary tract and respiratory tract infections were eradicated, accompanied by clinical success in 3 and 2 patients, respectively; the remaining patients were improved. superinfection with streptococcus group d,  pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus was seen in 3 patients. the emergence of resistance to temocillin occurred in an isolate of e. coli, and also possibly in an isolate of k. pneumoniae. no adverse reactions nor abnormal laboratory values related to temocillin administration were observed and, although 7 patients died, none of the deaths were attributable to uncontrolled gram-negative infection.

TI  == pathogenesis of escherichia coli cystitis and pyelonephritis: apparent lack of significance of bacterial motility and chemotaxis towards human urine.
AB  == all 45 microscopically motile urinary isolates tested here (37 escherichia coli,  two enterobacter cloacae, two citrobacter freundii, three proteus mirabilis and one proteus morganii) were strongly attracted to fresh human urine in a capillary chemotaxis assay. this observation suggested that urine taxis of gram-negative bacteria promotes their invasion of the human lower urinary tract and their ascension to the kidney(s). however, the incidence of motile isolates and their activity in urine taxis assays were similar for fecal e. coli isolates, for isolates from patients with recurrent cystitis and from patients with presumed pyelonephritis (e. coli blood isolates with concomitant e. coli bacteriuria). thus, the present study of e. coli did not support the hypothesis that bacterial  motility is a virulence factor in urinary tract infection.

TI  == application of in-vitro models: development of resistance.
AB  == the development of chromosomal beta-lactam resistance of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii was observed by following the bacterial kill-kinetics in an in-vitro model simulating human serum antibiotic concentrations. from sensitive escherichia coli cells mutants arose resistant to  aminopenicillins, and to first and second generation cephalosporins, whereas with the ent. cloacae and citro. freundii mutants were also resistant to cefotaxime. resistant mutants from all three species could also be selected on antibiotic-containing agar plates. with e. coli they occurred in two steps, the first mutation being stable but the second mutation reverting spontaneously. in ent. cloacae, and apparently also in citro. freundii, the mutation changes the cephalosporinase production from an inducible to a constitutive one. the different mutation rates, and the rate was extremely high for some ent. cloacae strains, were correlated with a corresponding reduction of viable cell count and  with the time of re-growth observed in the model.

TI  == cloning and expression in escherichia coli k-12 of the structural gene for outer  membrane phoe protein from enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == in escherichia coli k-12, the phoe gene encodes an outer membrane pore protein, which is induced by phosphate starvation. the corresponding gene of enterobacter  cloacae was transferred to e. coli k-12 by using rp4::mini mu plasmid pulb113 and selecting for r-prime plasmids that carry the genes proa and prob, which are closely linked to phoe in e. coli k-12. the phoe gene was subcloned into the multicopy vector pacyc184, and the location of the gene was determined by analysis of in vitro constructed deletion plasmids and mutant plasmids generated  by gamma delta insertions. the e. cloacae phoe gene is normally expressed in e. coli k-12, and the regulation of the expression is similar to that of the e. coli phoe gene. functionally, the products of the phoe genes of e. coli k-12 and e. cloacae behave very similarly since they form pores in the outer membrane with a  recognition site for negatively charged compounds and they serve as (part of) the receptor for phage tc45.

TI  == an evaluation of the bacteriolytic and biochemical properties of ceftiolene (42980rp).
AB  == ceftiolene (42980rp) is a new cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum similar to cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. the characteristics of ceftiolene have been tested in a variety of assays involving various biochemical aspects of the mode of action of beta-lactam antibiotics. the affinities of ceftiolene for penicillin-binding proteins were very comparable with those of ceftriaxone and cefotaxime for escherichia coli, and generally greater than those of latamoxef (moxalactam) for the higher molecular weight pbps of e. coli. enterobacter cloacae. proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the affinity of ceftiolene for pbp1 of staphylococcus aureus was greater than those of cefotaxime or latamoxef, but comparable with these antibiotics for pbp3. the bacteriolytic activity of ceftiolene at defined concentrations against gram-negative organisms  was similar to that of ceftriaxone, and significantly better than that of the other third-generation cephalosporins tested. introduction of plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases into e. coli reduced the wide variation in bacteriolytic effect of the different cephalosporins, and a significant inoculum effect was observed for the bacteriolysis. chloramphenicol was less antagonistic against ceftiolene-  or ceftriaxone-induced lysis than was observed for cefotaxime or latamoxef. growth of staph. aureus at low concentrations of ceftiolene caused the bacteria to become more sensitive to lysis by lysostaphin than organisms grown with cefotaxime or latamoxef under the same conditions. these observations confirm the necessity to use techniques other than routine mic determinations to distinguish  between antibiotics which would otherwise appear very similar.

TI  == novel method for studying the public health significance of macroinvertebrates occurring in potable water.

TI  == detection of pse-2 beta-lactamase in enterobacteria.
AB  == pse-2, a plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase which was previously considered pseudomonas specific, was observed in clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, providencia stuartii, and enterobacter cloacae. all four isolates transferred pse-2 production, together with resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin, kanamycin, and sulfamethoxazole, into escherichia coli j62-1 and pseudomonas aeruginosa pu21. transfer correlated with acquisition by the transconjugants of a 65-megadalton plasmid, and this element was considered to encode pse-2 expression. the pse-2 enzyme conferred high-level carbenicillin resistance on both j62-1 and pu21 transconjugants, although the pse-2-producing providencia stuartii isolate was susceptible to carbenicillin.

TI  == bacterial interference with coliform colony sheen production on membrane filters.
AB  == the membrane filter (mf) method for detection and enumeration of coliform bacteria in drinking water requires that the coliforms both grow and produce a green metallic sheen when the filter is incubated on modified endo medium at 35 degrees c for 22 h. large numbers of noncoliform bacteria, which are enumerated by the standard plate count (spc) technique, can interfere with the detection of  coliforms on mf. this paper presents quantitative evidence from laboratory experiments on the interference of specific spc bacteria on coliform colony sheen production on mf. pseudomonas aeruginosa and aeromonas hydrophila caused significant reductions in escherichia coli sheen colony counts when present at 3,000 and 220 per filter, respectively. the flavobacterium sp. and bacillus sp. selected for this study from spc did not interfere with coliform colony sheen production. excessive crowding of e. coli and enterobacter cloacae colonies on mf also caused a reduction in the number of colonies that produced sheen. even when  there was no crowding (14 colonies per filter), only a fraction of the e. cloacae colonies produced sheen colonies on modified endo medium.

TI  == transfer of the chromosomal bla gene from enterobacter cloacae to escherichia coli by rp4::mini-mu.
AB  == the resistance gene for beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporins from enterobacter cloacae was transferred to escherichia coli by the aid of rp4::mini-mu. the r-prime plasmids generated carried 60 to 80 kilobases (kb) of e. cloacae dna and  coded for the chromosomal e. cloacae beta-lactamase. the gene was fully expressed in the recipient. restriction endonuclease ecori fragments of the r-prime plasmid pbp100 were cloned into the vector pbp328, yielding the plasmid pbp102 with a size of 14 kb. a restriction map of this plasmid was constructed. by digesting pbp102 into seven psti fragments, ligating the fragments, and looking for the smallest plasmid generated, pbp103 was isolated. it consisted of three psti fragments, two of them (together 4.2 kb) necessary for resistance. during the experiment (performed in a reca+ background) the largest psti fragment had undergone a substitution of a 0.3-kb segment of pbp102 by a 0.7-kb segment in pbp103 (as deduced by heteroduplex analysis). the bla gene of resistant e. cloacae strains was dominant over the gene of susceptible organisms.

TI  == influence of methoxy-substitution of beta-lactam compounds on the interaction with various beta-lactamases.
AB  == the interaction of 6 alpha-(temocillin) and 7 alpha-methoxy substituted (cefoxitin) beta-lactam compounds with various beta-lactamases was studied employing enzyme kinetics and compared to that of unsubstituted compounds. both chromosomally mediated enzymes from enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii were competitively inhibited by the methoxy-substituted compounds. higher concentrations of cefoxitin caused a competitive inhibition of the plasmid-mediated tem-1 enzyme, whereas temocillin led to a non-competitive inhibition of the tem-1 enzyme. these results indicate that the discrepancies in  the interaction on the above mentioned compounds have to be attributed to the different molecular structure of the beta-lactam nucleus. moreover, no predictions can be made on the basis of an analogy between 6 alpha-methoxy-penams and 7 alpha-methoxy cephems.

TI  == synthesis of plasmid-coded heat-labile enterotoxin in wild-type and hypertoxinogenic strains of escherichia coli and in other genera of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == the effect of host determinants on expression of plasmid-coded heat-labile enterotoxin (lt) was examined. a collection of lt plasmids was introduced into isogenic strains of escherichia coli k-12 strains containing the wild type or hypertoxinogenic (htx-2) allele. for each plasmid tested, production of lt increased by approximately 1.5- to 3-fold in the host containing htx-2, indicating that the htx-2 allele affects a regulatory function for lt production  that is common to many different enterotoxin plasmids. lt plasmids from e. coli were also introduced into strains of shigella flexneri, shigella sonnei, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and salmonella typhimurium. the plasmids were stably maintained and determined production of lt  in those genera, although the amounts of lt produced varied by more than 50-fold. these observations demonstrate that host factors have an important role in determining the level of expression of plasmid-coded lt genes and support the hypothesis that interspecific, conjugal transfer of enterotoxin plasmids may confer enterotoxigenicity to a wide variety of potentially pathogenic enteric bacteria.

AB  == the recently updated ms-2 bacterial identification system software (abbott laboratories, diagnostic division, irving, tex.) was compared with the original ms-2 bacterial identification software and the api 20e, using 968 strains of enterobacteriaceae. the updated ms-2 software correctly identified 94.4% of the isolates tested. api 20e and the original ms-2 software correctly identified 91 and 85.3% of the strains, respectively. ms-2 responses were considered to be equivocal (needing additional tests for verification) if the percent likelihood values were less than 80%. the percentage of equivocal responses was reduced from 6.5% with the original software to 2.2% with the updated software, and the percentage of incorrect identifications was reduced from 8.2 to 3.4% with the original and updated software, respectively. organisms belonging to 25 taxonomic  groups were tested. direct comparison of the two ms-2 programs showed that the updated ms-2 software increased the identification accuracy of salmonella spp., enterobacter cloacae, providencia stuartii, escherichia coli, shigella spp., klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, and acinetobacter  calcoaceticus. a decrease in accuracy was seen with citrobacter freundii, hafnia  alvei, enterobacter agglomerans, and yersinia pseudotuberculosis when the updated software was used. the remaining 12 taxonomic groups were not affected by the software changes. the updated ms-2 software appears to significantly improve the  identification accuracy of the ms-2 bacterial identification system.

TI  == comparative study of fosfomycin activity in mueller-hinton media and in tissues.
AB  == fosfomycin utilizes two uptake systems as ways of entry into microorganisms: the  l-a-glycerophosphate and the hexose phosphate transport system. the latter is inducible by glucose-6-phosphate. the relationship between glucose-6-phosphate (concentration range 0-100 mg/l) and the susceptibility of staphylococcus aureus  was studied in mueller-hinton broth. an almost maximal enhancement of fosfomycin  activity was found at 25 mg/l glucose-6-phosphate. fosfomycin activity against staph. aureus, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella spp., serratia spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa was studied by use of  the broth and the agar dilution method, in the presence and absence of glucose-6-phosphate (25 mg/l). the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of fosfomycin against staph. aureus streptococcus faecalis, e. coli, ent. cloacae, pr. mirabilis, and ps. aeruginosa were estimated in particle free supernatants of 25% tissue homogenates (liver, kidney, lung, heart) and in parallel in mueller-hinton broth. with few exceptions the mics in mueller-hinton broth (with  glucose-6-phosphate) were similar to those found in tissues (no glucose-6-phosphate added).

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the bactec resin-containing blood culture bottle.
AB  == the bactec resin-containing blood culture bottle (16b; johnston laboratories) was designed to bind antibiotics and to support bacterial growth. however, only modest increases in the recovery rates of pathogens have been found in clinical studies. this in vitro study evaluated the ability of the 16b to recover organisms from human serum containing clinically achievable concentrations of antibiotics. escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, and a viridans streptococcus were added to serum containing antibiotic(s), and at various time intervals of antibiotic exposure, portions were removed and inoculated into both the 16b and the 6b (conventional aerobic) bottles. the studies of the kinetics of killing of the bacterial strains by the various antibiotics showed a good correlation between those combinations of bacteria-antibiotic(s) which produced slow killing and the combinations of bacteria-antibiotic(s) which were recovered preferentially in the 16b bottles. low recovery rates were noted when the antibiotics killed the organisms rapidly.  the indications for use of the resin-containing blood culture bottle should be limited to those situations in which the patient is receiving antibiotics and the bacteremia is suspected to involve a pathogen which is killed slowly by the administered drug(s) or when the bacteremia is continuous. the failure of the bactec 16b blood culture bottle to recover organisms may in part reflect the bactericidal activity of the antibiotics administered.

TI  == chromosomal beta-lactamases of enterobacter cloacae are responsible for resistance to third-generation cephalosporins.
AB  == about 70% of all enterobacter cloacae strains tested possessed one of two species-specific beta-lactamases. these enzymes, e. cloacae beta-lactamase a and  e. cloacae beta-lactamase b, with isoelectric points of 8.8 and 7.8, respectively, had the same ph and temperature optima. both showed similar enzyme  kinetics and were inhibited by cloxacillin but not by p-chloromercuribenzoate. e. cloacae beta-lactamase b appeared to be identical with the enzyme of e. cloacae p99. by a mutation in a regulatory gene, inducible enzyme production could be converted into constitutive expression. in e. cloacae, both enzymes did not hydrolyze third-generation cephalosporins, but they were solely responsible for resistance toward these drugs. this was demonstrated by the characterization of escherichia coli strains expressing an identical resistance pattern after transfer of the corresponding enterobacter gene.

AB  == in a randomised prospective study 61 patients with lower urinary tract infection  received either 200 mg norfloxacin (33 patients) or 480 mg cotrimoxazole (28 patients) twice daily for ten days. pathogens included escherichia coli in 48 patients, proteus mirabilis in ten patients, and enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii and staphylococcus saprophyticus in one patient  each. the mics of norfloxacin and cotrimoxazole were less than or equal to 0.03 mg/l and less than or equal to 1 mg/l respectively. on the tenth day of treatment 94% of the patients receiving norfloxacin and 89% of the patients receiving cotrimoxazole were clinically cured, and the pathogens were eradicated in 94% and 96% of the patients respectively. at six week follow-up one patient given cotrimoxazole and two given norfloxacin had a reinfection. no side-effects or toxicity were observed with the exception of a diffuse rash in one patient receiving cotrimoxazole in whom treatment was discontinued. it is concluded that  norfloxacin is safe and as effective as cotrimoxazole in the treatment of lower uti and should have an important role to play whenever multiresistant organisms are implicated.

AB  == the plasmid-mediated tem-1 enzyme (e. coli k12 r6k) and chromosomally mediated enzymes from enterobacter cloacae (iep 8.5) and citrobacter freundii (iep 9.5) were highly purified. enzyme kinetics were studied with various therapeutic compounds as substrates and lamoxactam, azthreonam, and n-formimidoyl thienamycin as inhibitors. lamoxactam and azthreonam failed to inhibit the tem-1 enzyme, whereas n-formimidoyl thienamycin was a competitive inhibitor. ki was 5 mumol/l--thus corresponding to km--and independent of the substrate. with respect to chromosomally mediated enzymes, there was a time-dependent inhibition of beta-lactam hydrolysis. ki ranged from 0.06 to 0.2 mumol/l in dependence of the inhibitor. enzyme kinetics suggested a non-competitive type of inhibition thus indicating that binding of these compounds to both chromosomally mediated enzymes must be followed by a further reaction step. it is evident that the stability against beta-lactamases of recently developed compounds is based on different mechanisms--characteristic for the enzyme being considered.

TI  == characterization of beta-lactamase induction in enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == the induction of beta-lactamase was studied in a strain of enterobacter cloacae.  a wide variety of beta-lactam compounds were found to induce beta-lactamase in this organism, and the degree of induction was directly related to the stability  of the inducer to degradation by the enzyme. the kinetics of the induction process were consistent with a system normally under repressor control, suggesting a direct interaction of the beta-lactam compound with a repressor protein in the e. cloacae cells. although these characteristics are common to many inducible systems in gram-negative organisms, the induction of beta-lactamase in this strain was not subject to catabolite repression with glucose and remained unaffected by exogenous cyclic amp in the culture medium. this suggests that the organization and function of the beta-lactamase regulatory genes in e. cloacae are unlike those of other inducible gene systems, such as those composing the well-characterized lactose operon in escherichia coli.

TI  == nif-hybrids of enterobacter: selection for nif gene integration with chlorate.
AB  == the nif gene group from klebsiella can be transferred into enterobacter cloacae by conjugation using escherichia coli donor cells carrying the composite self-transmissible nif-plasmid prd1. a small fraction of the hybrids obtained is  stable upon prolonged passaging without selection. their stability is due to integration of prd1 into the chromosome. such integration hybrids were chlorate resistant, and nitrate reductase negative, which indicated that integration preferentially occurred within one of the genes for the production or functioning of this enzyme. chlorate resistance could, therefore, be used to select for additional nitrate reductase-negative sublines with prd1 in their chromosome. such sublines have been analyzed further for the presence of nif genes, other prd1 markers, and for stability. in all except one the complete plasmid seems to  have been integrated. some tend to revert to nitrate utilisation (chlorate sensitivity).

TI  == [the antibiotic agent azthreonam: studies on plasmid-dependent resistance formation].
AB  == two mechanisms can be assumed that are responsible for the stability of azthreonam against the attack of beta-lactamases: first, azthreonam lacks binding to the enzyme protein and second, rate of hydrolysis is extremely low, resulting  even in inhibition of enzyme activity. enzyme kinetics were studied from highly purified enzymes: azthreonam did not bind to the tem-1 enzyme, whereas the compound revealed a time-dependent inhibition of the chromosomally mediated enterobacter cloacae enzyme. with various cephalosporins as substrates marked discrepancies in the mode of inhibition were observed: cefacedone revealed merely noncompetitive inhibition, cefazolin and cefoperazone demonstrated mixed-inhibition kinetics, and with cephalothin as the substrate enzyme kinetics  strongly suggested binding of a second azthreonam molecule. with cefacedone as the substrate ki was ascertained to be 0.8 x 10(-7) mol/l. conjugative transfer of the tem-mediating plasmids r6k and rp1 resulted in 20 to 50-fold increase of the mic's for the enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii recipients, in spite of the fact that azthreonam does not serve as a substrate for the tem-1 enzyme. these findings have likely to be attributed to an impaired penetration of the compound through the "outer membrane" of the recipient strains.

AB  == the larvae of pimpla turionellae, that develop in pupae of various lepidoptera, discharged through their anus up to 8 microliters/h of a hyaline liquid, which is termed "anal secretion". it exerted a strong bacteriostatic effect on enterobacter cloacae, a highly virulent intestinal microorganism isolated from the midgut of the host pupa, pieris brassicae. growth inhibition of escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus and pseudomonas phaseolicola was also evident, but less  pronounced. inhibition depended upon the concentration of the anal secretion. this was also true regarding the effect on growth of beauveria bassiana, a fungus pathogenic on insects. the antimycotic action of the anal secretion was less effective against chaetomium pululiferum, a soil-inhabiting fungus. growing hyphae of b. bassiana were malformed, exhibiting the so-called "curling effect",  when treated with anal secretion. parenteral injection of a low dose of enterobacter cloacae resulted in 100% mortality of non parasitized pupae of pieris brassicae; however, simultaneous injection of 3 microliters of anal secretion resulted in higher survival.

TI  == [n-formimidoyl-thienamycin: in vitro activity in bacteria with resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics or gentamicin].
AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of n-formimidoyl-thienamycin were determined for 25 strains each of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa which were resistant to gentamicin and/or acylureido penicillins or cefotaxime, cefoperazone or moxalactam, and for 38 strains of the group d streptococci. the drug was very active against the most frequently encountered gram-negative resistant causative organisms of nosocomial  infections. the mic ranged from 0.25-1 mg/l for multiresistant enterobacteriaceae, and from 0.5-4 mg/l for multiresistant p. aeruginosa. the group d streptococci (enterococci) showed a low mic (median: 0.75 mg/l); the median of the mbc was greater than 64 mg/l, however.

TI  == 6-acetylmethylenepenicillanic acid (ro 15-1903), a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. ii. antibacterial properties.
AB  == the beta-lactamase inhibitor ro 15-1903 showed low affinity for penicillin binding proteins (pbps) of escherichia coli. when used as a single compound, it displayed no substantial antibacterial activity but in combination with ampicillin, it was similar to clavulanic acid in conferring activity against ampicillin-resistant strains. some synergy between ro 15-1903 and piperacillin was found against high inocula of pseudomonas aeruginosa. ro 15-1903 markedly enhanced the activity of ceftriaxone against bacteroides fragilis. in keeping with the in vitro findings, the combination ro 15-1903 and ampicillin protected mice against systemic infections with beta-lactamase-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus sp. but not against those with enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and e. coli producing either chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of type i or plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase of type tem.

TI  == outer membrane permeation of beta-lactam antibiotics in escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == mutant strains lacking outer membrane protein(s) were isolated from escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae. the outer membrane protein(s)  of p. mirabilis and e. cloacae corresponding to e. coli porin were identified on  the basis of their function, namely, their ability to allow the permeation of glucose as demonstrated by [14c]glucose uptake by intact cells. p. mirabilis has  only one outer membrane pore protein (molecular weight, 40,000), but e. cloacae has at least two such proteins (molecular weights, 37,000 and 39,000 to 40,000).  when the bacteria lost these proteins or porin, the outer membrane permeation of  cefazolin was found to be greatly reduced in these three species. such a change in the outer membrane permeation closely correlated with a significant decrease in the bacterial susceptibility to cephalosporins, including cefoxitin. these results suggested that the main pathway for cephalosporin permeation is the pore  made up of these proteins. the 39,000- to 40,000-molecular-weight protein in e. cloacae was also assumed to play an important role in the outer membrane permeation of tetracycline and chloramphenicol. on the other hand, the permeation route of penicillins was obscure. the susceptibility to penicillins, except in some cases, was little influenced by the absence of the proteins. ampicillin was  found to pass through the outer membrane via the same route as the cephalosporins, but the possibility that ampicillin and other penicillins possess another unknown route for outer membrane permeation could not be ruled out.

TI  == insect immunity: isolation and structure of cecropins b and d from pupae of the chinese oak silk moth, antheraea pernyi.
AB  == the immune system in the chinese oak silk moth, antheraea pernyi, has been compared with that of the cecropia moth which has been characterized earlier. antibacterial activity against escherichia coli was induced in diapausing pupae by injection of viable e. coli or enterobacter cloacae. the activity reached a maximum on day 7-8 after which the response gradually declined. the pupae produced a set of immune proteins with p4 and p5 as major labelled components similar to that earlier found in cecropia. the major antibacterial factor in a. pernyi was cecropin d. a procedure is described for the isolation of cecropin b and d, which is in principle similar to the one used for the isolation of the corresponding cecropins from cecropia pupae. amino acid sequence analyses of the  a. pernyi cecropins show the d form to contain 36 amino acid residues and that both cecropins have blocked c-termini. the general structure of cecropins having  a charged n-terminal region (residues 1-21) followed by a long hydrophobic stretch (residues 22-32) is well conserved. cecropin b and d from a. pernyi differ from the corresponding proteins in cecropia by four and three conservative amino acid replacements, respectively. the homology between the cecropins from the two insects suggests that they orginate from a single ancestral gene. the antibacterial activity was tested against nine different bacterial species. evolutionary aspects of the cecropins are discussed.

TI  == comparative activity of cefotaxime and selected beta-lactam antibiotics against haemophilus influenzae and aerobic gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == the activity of cefotaxime was compared with that of ampicillin, moxalactam, and  cefoperozone against 50 isolates of haemophilus influenzae and with that of ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefamandole, cefazolin, and several other established and investigational beta-lactam antibiotics against several hundred isolates of gram-negative aerobic enteric bacilli. minimal inhibitory concentrations of the drugs were determined by the agar plate dilution technique for h. influenzae and by the microtiter broth dilution technique for the other pathogens. cefotaxime was the most active agent against h. influenzae;  it was 20 times more active than ampicillin. it was also the most active agent against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, nontyphoid salmonella species, and yersinia enterocolitica. cefotaxime was among the most active agents against  enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter species, shigella species, proteus mirabilis, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. none of the new cephalosporins or penicillin inhibited greater than 90% of the isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa at concentrations of less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml; these drugs were, however, more active than carbenicillin.

TI  == properties and proteolysis of ferric enterobactin outer membrane receptor in escherichia coli k12.
AB  == a protein with a relative subunit molecular weight of 81000 (81k) has been isolated in virtually pure form from the outer membrane of low iron grown cells of escherichia coli k12. the 81k protein, which is part of the receptor complex for translocation of the siderophore ferric enterobactin, displays activity in vitro for binding both ferric enterobactin and colicin b. the dissociation constant for the 81k-ferric enterobactin compound at 4 degrees c in 2% triton-0.1 m tris, ph 7, was determined to be 10 nm. the n-terminal amino acid was identified as phenylalanine, and the amino acid composition was shown to be similar to that published for the ferric aerobactin-cloacin receptor of enterobacter cloacae. a plasmid-bearing strain of e. coli was employed to confirm that degradation of 81k to a slightly smaller, inactive form (81k) is performed by a second outer membrane component, protein a. the endoproteolytic action of protein a was verified by the finding of alanine as the n-terminal residue of 81k. a survey of enteric species suggests that the 81k-protein a interaction is confined to the k12 strain of e. coli.

TI  == resistance to cefamandole: derepression of beta-lactamases by cefoxitin and mutation in enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == studies were performed to characterize resistance to cefamandole in two strains of enterobacter cloacae. susceptible wild-type cells were exposed either to cefamandole to select stably resistant mutants or to cefoxitin to induce unstable resistance. the two types of resistant cells inactivated cefamandole, and their beta-lactamases had identical isoelectric focusing patterns and substrate profiles. studies of the beta-lactamases of these resistant cells indicated that  the enzymes belonged to the richmond and sykes group i and suggested that their production in wild-type cells is under repressor control. the resistant mutants appeared to be stably derepressed at the locus for beta-lactamase expression, whereas cefoxitin-induced cells were reversibly derepressed wild-type cells. transfer of plasmids from one mutant colony to recipient escherichia coli cells did not transfer resistance. these two types of resistance to cefamandole may explain the widely discrepant results obtained during in vitro and in vivo studies, as well as the rapid emergence of resistance that has been observed during clinical use.

AB  == thirty-five patients underwent 38 treatment courses with cefotaxime. documented infections included 11 bacteremias, 7 cases of nosocomial pneumonia, 6 surgical wound infections, 3 bone infections, 1 biliary infection, and 1 urinary tract infection. granulocytopenic patients with fever received 15 courses of empiric cefotaxime therapy alone; in 8 courses, no definite site of infection or pathogen was isolated. broad-spectrum antibiotics had been administered to 23 patients before cefotaxime. thirty-seven bacterial pathogens were isolated from 25 patients. three such pathogens were resistant to cefotaxime and required alternative therapies. pathogenic isolates included 13 serratia marcescens, 12 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 escherichia coli, 2 klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 providencia stuartii, 1 enterobacter cloacae, 1 haemophilus influenzae, 1 enterococcus, and 1 staphylococcus aureus. of the treatment courses, 25 of 38 resulted in a favorable response to cefotaxime, including 9 of 15 in granulocytopenic patients. superinfection was seen in one patient. the emergence  of resistance was documented in another patient. of 15 patients with multiply resistant pathogens, 12 improved with cefotaxime. of 12 patients with pseudomonas aeruginosa, 6 favorably responded. possible complications of cefotaxime were observed in 14 of 42 treatment courses. cefotaxime is most useful in treatment of infections due to multiply resistant, gram-negative pathogens other than pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == complementary activity of mezlocillin and the combination of amoxicillin with clavulanic acid on enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == the mics of amoxicillin, mezlocillin and brl 25,000, a combination of two parts amoxicillin and one part clavulanic acid (2am + 1ca), were measured for 331 enterobacteriaceae strains which produced beta-lactamases as demonstrated by nitrocefin. the mic values for mezlocillin and the combination 2am + 1ca were very similar for the total number of the strains investigated. when investigated  separately according to the bacterial species, three different sensitivity groups were established for the above-mentioned preparations: 1) species with the same or similar sensitivity to mezlocillin and 2am + 1ca (escherichia coli and shigella spp., amoxicillin-resistant strains); 2) species which were more sensitive to mezlocillin than to the combination 2am + 1ca (citrobacter spp., enterobacter cloacae, serratia spp. and indole-positive proteus as well as strains of e. coli and shigella spp. which produce a cephalosporinase and are sensitive to amoxicillin); 3) species which are more sensitive to 2am + 1ca than  to mezlocillin (amoxicillin-resistant salmonella spp., proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae). this complementary activity of mezlocillin and 2am + 1ca  against enterobacteriaceae depended on the beta-lactamases produced.

TI  == effect of clindamycin prophylaxis on the colonic microflora in patients undergoing colorectal surgery.
AB  == clindamycin was given intravenously to 15 patients undergoing colorectal surgery  in an initial dose of 600 mg, given at induction of anesthesia followed by 6 doses of 600 mg at 8-h intervals. series of serum samples and fecal specimens were taken for analysis of clindamycin concentrations. tissue samples from the gut wall were taken at surgery. the highest serum concentrations observed occurred 30 min after administration of clindamycin and varied between 6.8 and 37.9 microgram/ml (mean, 14.8 +/- 2.0 [standard error] microgram/ml). the clindamycin concentrations in the tissue samples were between 1.8 and 13.0 microgram/g. clindamycin concentration in the fecal samples varied between 2.1 and 460 microgram/g. fecal samples were also collected during the investigation period for cultivation of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. among the aerobic bacteria, enterococci and streptococci decreased during the prophylaxis period. anaerobic bacteria also decreased significantly during the same period. after the clindamycin administration period, enterococci, streptococci and anaerobic bacteria proliferated. no anaerobic strains resistant to clindamycin were isolated. postoperative infections due to streptococcus faecalis and different enterobacteria such as escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and klebsiella occurred in five patients.

TI  == the inhibition of beta-lactamases from gram-negative bacteria by clavulanic acid.
AB  == the beta-lactamase from klebsiella pneumoniae e70 behaved in a similar fashion to the tem-2 plasmid mediated enzyme on reaction with clavulanic acid. both enzymes  produced two types of enzyme-clavulanate complex, a transiently stable species (t((1/2))=4min at ph7.3 and 37 degrees c) and irreversibly inhibited enzyme. in the initial rapid reaction (2.5min) the enzymes partitioned between the transient and irreversible complexes in the ratios 3:1 for tem-2 beta-lactamase and 1:1 for klebsiella beta-lactamase. biphasic inactivation was observed for both enzymes and the slower second phase was rate limited by the decay of the transiently stable complex. this decay released free enzyme for further reaction with fresh clavulanic acid, the products again partitioning between transiently stable and irreversibly inhibited enzyme. this cycle continued until all the enzyme had been irreversibly inhibited. a 115 molar excess of inhibitor was required to achieve complete inactivation of tem-2 beta-lactamase. hydrolysis of clavulanic acid with product release appeared to occur with the inhibition reaction, which explained this degree of clavulanic acid turnover. the stoichiometry of the interaction with klebsiella beta-lactamase was not examined. the penicillinase from proteus mirabilis c889 was rapidly inhibited by low concentrations of clavulanic acid. the major product was a moderately stable complex (t((1/2))=40min at ph7.3 and 37 degrees c); the proportion of the enzyme that was irreversibly inactivated was small. the cephalosporinase from enterobacter cloacae p99 had low affinity for the inhibitor and only reacted with high concentrations of clavulanic acid (k=4.0m(-1).s(-1)) to produce a relatively stable complex (t((1/2))=180min at ph7.3 and 37 degrees c). no irreversible inactivation of this enzyme was detected. the rates of decay of the clavulanate-enzyme complexes produced in reactions with proteus and enterobacter enzymes were markedly increased at acid ph.

TI  == the in-vivo antibacterial activity of ceftazidime (gr 20263)--a comparison with other new beta-lactam antibiotics and gentamicin.
AB  == ceftazidime was compared with cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefmenoxime, cefotiam, cefoperazone, moxalactam, piperacillin, carbenicillin, mezlocillin, cefsulodin and the aminoglycoside antibiotic gentamicin in a series of mouse protection tests. ceftazidime, together with the other cephalosporin antibiotics and moxalactam were equally effective against infections caused by staphylococcus aureus with ed50 values ranging from 3.5 to 25 mg/kg. gentamicin was the most active antibiotic with ed50 values of 0.4 and 1.6 mg/kg. ceftazidime showed excellent activity against enterobacteriaceae with ed50 values ranging from 0.2-0.9 mg/kg for escherichia coli strains, 1.1-13.8 mg/kg for indole positive and negative proteus spp, and 0.1-25 for enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia spp. similar activity against many of the test strains of enterobacteriaceae was found for gentamicin, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefmenoxime and moxalactam, although cefotiam and cefoperazone were significantly less active than ceftazidime. ceftazidime was significantly more active than the other beta-lactam antibiotics tested against pseudomonas aeruginosa infections with ed50 values ranging from 02-108 mg/kg. only the aminoglycoside antibiotic gentamicin, with ed(50,s) 0.6-6.3 mg/kg, was as effective as ceftazidime. very poor activity was found for moxalactam, cefoperazone, piperacillin, carbenicillin and mezlocillin against the majority of the test strains of pseudomonas. the results of these in-vivo indicate that ceftazidime is a promising potential alternative to aminoglycoside antibiotics.

TI  == antibacterial activity of ceftazidime (gr 20263) against routine hospital isolates and highly resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == ceftazidime was found to be highly active against routine hospital isolates of strains of enterobacteriaceae such as escherichia coli, klebsiella aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis, with the mean mics varying between 0.11 and 0.75 mg/l. it had marked activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa with a  mean mic of 1.8 mg/l which was comparable to tobramycin (11 mg/l) and superior to other aminoglycosides, penicillins and cefotaxime. although ceftazidime was considerably more active than cefuroxime and cefamandole against e. coli, k. aerogenes and ent. cloacae, its activity against strains with multi-antibiotic resistance and marked beta-lactamase production was much diminished, with mean mics between 5 and 21 mg/l. these results with ceftazidime suggest it will be a valuable parenteral compound in the treatment of severe bacterial infections due  to strains of the enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == successful treatment of gram-negative bacillary meningitis with moxalactam.
AB  == meningitis caused by enteric gram-negative bacilli is relatively uncommon but is  very difficult to treat despite susceptibility in vitro to many antimicrobics. a  major problem appears to be poor entry of many drugs into the central nervous system. moxalactam is an investigational cephalosporin that attains concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid that are 15% to 30% of contemporaneous  serum concentrations; moreover, it is quite active against many of the enteric gram-negative bacilli. we used moxalactam to treat meningitis caused by enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli in four adults  and one child, giving up to 100 mg/kg body weight per day by intravenous injection. the concentrations of moxalactam in serum, lumbar, and ventricular cerebrospinal fluid exceeded the minimal lethal concentrations of all causative bacteria. the patients were cured. in this small series, moxalactam, when administered intravenously as the sole agent of therapy, was effective in the treatment of meningitis caused by susceptible gram-negative bacilli.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of fr-31564, a phosphonic acid antimicrobial agent.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo activity of fr-31564 [sodium hydrogen 3-(n-hydroxyformamido)propylphosphate] against gram-positive and -negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was investigated and compared with that of fosfomycin, cephalexin, carbenicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. the in  vitro activity of fr-31564 was markedly enhanced when combined with glucose 6-phosphate or fructose 6-phosphate, but not when combined with ribose phosphate, adenosine monophosphate, or glycerol phosphate. in vitro activity of fr-31564 also was enhanced by human or horse blood, but not by human serum. the type of medium had a great effect on the minimal inhibitory concentration, with the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations achieved on nutrient agar, 8- to 16-fold less than with mueller-hinton, heart infusion, or trypticase soy agars. fr-31564  was more active than fosfomycin, cephalexin, carbenicillin, or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, enterobacter cloacae, e. aerogenes, and citrobacter. it was less active than fosfomycin against serratia marcescens and proteus mirabilis and did not inhibit gram-positive cocci or anaerobic species. fr-31564 inhibited a number of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and some pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to the other agents. in the presence and absence of human blood fr-31564 showed bactericidal activity, and p. aeruginosa exposed to fr-31564 for  3 h showed a 6-h lag in regrowth. fr-31564 administered by the subcutaneous route was more active in protecting mice challenged with p. aeruginosa than was fosfomycin, carbenicillin, or cefoperazone. it was as active by the oral route in protecting mice challenged with e. coli as was fosfomycin, ampicillin, cephalexin, or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole.

TI  == biochemical characteristics and identification of enterobacteriaceae isolated from meats.
AB  == the isolation and identification of 2,220 enterobacteriaceae from meats indicated that escherichia coli biotype i, enterobacter agglomerans, and serratia liquefaciens were the principal types to be differentiated in meats. citrobacter  freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and enterobacter hafniae were also commonly identified. identification of isolates by the encise ii (roche diagnostics inc., nutley, n.j.) and minitek (bbl microbiology systems, cockeysville, md.) coding systems gave similar results with only 255 (11.5%) discrepancies in identity, but both systems required large numbers of supplementary tests for identification of the isolates. not only the distribution of enterobacteriaceae types isolated from meats but also some of the biochemical  reactions of the isolates differed from those of clinical isolates. the minitek technique is recommended because of its versatility. however, with the addition of cellobiose and salicin disks and the inclusion of methyl red to the minitek test and the use of the voges-proskauer test and gas production in ec medium at elevated temperature as standard tests, the identification of these enterobacteriaceae from meats would be greatly facilitated. the inclusion of the  motility test, for example, using nitrate motility agar, would also be of value to enterobacteriaceae identification.

AB  == antibody-coated bacteria tests, using fluorescein-conjugated rabbit anti-canine immunoglobulin (ig)g and anti-iga, were conducted on 77 specimens of bladder urine obtained by antepubic cystocentesis from 25 dogs with urinary tract infections. urine specimens from 3 dogs infected with staphylococcus aureus were  tested a total of 27 times, specimens from 10 dogs infected with escherichia coli were tested 25 times, urine from 6 dogs infected with proteus mirabilis was sampled and tested 18 times, urine from 3 dogs with klebsiella pneumoniae was sampled and tested 4 times, and specimens from 3 dogs infected with p rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, or streptococcus faecalis were tested once each. specimens  of urine from the renal pelves of each dogs were obtained by percutaneous nephropyelocentesis at the same time as the specimens of bladder urine. the results of bacterial cultures of these specimens were compared with the results of the corresponding antibody-coated bacteria tests. false-positive results (ie,  evidence of antibody coating of bladder urine bacteria but no bacterial growth from corresponding renal pelvis urine specimens) were obtained in 13 of 22 (59%)  tests of dogs infected with s aureus, 12 of 13 (92%) tests in dogs infected with  p mirabiis, 5 of 18(28%) tests in dogs infected with e coli, and 1 of 4 (25%) tests in dogs infected with k pneumoniae. false-negative results (ie, bacterial growth from renal pelvis urine specimens but no evidence of antibody coating of bacteria in the corresponding specimen of bladder urine) occurred in 5 of 7 (71%) specimens infected with e coli, in 4 of 5 (80%) specimens infected with p mirabilis, and in 5 of 5 (100%) specimens infected with s aureus. it was concluded that the antibody-coated bacteria test does not provide accurate information to support the diagnosis of pyelonephritis in the dog.

TI  == antibacterial activity of ceftizoxime, a beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ceftizoxime was compared with that of other beta-lactam  antibiotics against 538 isolates. ceftizoxime was the most active agent tested against escherichia coli and klebsiella, inhibiting 80% at 0.025 microgram/ml. it was more active than cefotaxime against enterobacter cloacae and e. aerogenes. ceftizoxime was more active than cefoxitin, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, and carbenicillin against proteus mirabilis and indole-positive proteus. it inhibited 97% of multiresistant serratia isolates at 12.5 microgram/ml, whereas cefotaxime  inhibited only 19%. ceftizoxime was less active than cefotaxime and cefoperazone  against pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was more active than carbenicillin. it was more active than cefotaxime and cefoxitin against bacteroides. it was not appreciably destroyed by beta-lactamases of staphylococcus aureus, enterobacteriaceae, or pseudomonas.

AB  == two gram-positive and five gram-negative species of bacteria commonly isolated from clinical specimens were used in 704 different inoculum ratios against 11 antimicrobial agents to study the effect of contamination levels on the susceptibility patterns of mixed cultures. staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae were used in 12 combinations of two each. the pure culture inoculum tubes were prepared according to autobac i (pfizer inc.) instructions. various amounts from 0.01 to 2.0 ml of one bacterial  inoculum were mixed with various amounts of the other bacterial inoculum to form  16 mixtures to low-thymidine eugonic broth. in the majority of cases, susceptibility to antimicrobial agents started to change at 12.5% contamination level. of 1,936 mixtures with 5% contamination levels, 98.5 to 99.2% exhibited the same susceptibilities as did the pure cultures. these results suggest that generally contamination levels of more than 5% or 70,000 to 150,000 bacteria per  ml, are responsible for a significant change in apparent drug susceptibility.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of cefoperazone (t-1551), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin.
AB  == cefoperazone, a new semisynthetic cephalosporin, has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. it is as active as cefazolin and cefamandole against gram-positive bacteria and is more active than cefazolin and cefamandole against  such gram-negative bacilli as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, and  serratia marcescens. the superiority of cefoperazone over cefazolin and cefamandole with respect to activity against p. aeruginosa by more than 200-fold  was especially remarkable. as with other beta-lactam antibiotics, there was only  a small spread between the minimum inhibitory concentrations and the minimum bactericidal concentrations of cefoperazone and a significant decrease in activity with an increase in inoculum size. activity was not altered significantly by the addition of human serum to the test medium. cefoperazone is  relatively stable to hydrolysis to beta-lactamases produced by gram-negative bacteria. relative rates of hydrolysis of cefoperazone by cephalosporinases are 7.0 to 0.01, with reference to cephaloridine hydrolysis (base, 100). cefoperazone is also more stable than penicillin g and cephaloridine to various types of penicillinases.

AB  == gentamicin resistance in klebsiella pneumoniae involved in an outbreak at the minneapolis veterans administration hospital was due to a transmissible r plasmid. in addition to gentamicin, this plasmid conferred resistance to tobramycin, kanamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, and sulfathiazole. r plasmids which transferred this complex antibiogram were identified in several clinical isolates, including four different serotypes of k. pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus morganii. the covalently closed circular form of all r plasmids isolated had a sedimentation coefficient of 76s to 77s, corresponding to a molecular weight of 58 x 10(6). the possibility that a single r plasmid was responsible for the dissemination of multiple drug resistance among all of these different clinical strains was examined by characterizing the plasmids by using ecori restriction endonuclease.  the same 15 fragments were obtained from each of the 10 plasmids analyzed. their  molecular weights ranged from 4 x 10(5) to 11 x 10(6). thus, we conclude that each of the 10 plasmids present in the various clinical strains isolated from the hospital over a 7-month period originated from a common source and that r plasmid transfer was important in their spread.

TI  == rapid enumeration of fecal coliforms in water by a colorimetric beta-galactosidase assay.
AB  == the colorimetric beta-galactosidase assay is based upon the enzymatic hydrolysis  of the substrate o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactoside (onpg) by fecal coliforms. this technique provides an estimate of the fecal coliform concentration within 8 to 20 h. a 100-ml portion of test sample was passed through a 0.45 micrometer membrane  filter. this filter was then incubated at 37 degrees c for 1 h in ec medium followed by the addition of filter-sterilized onpg. the incubation was continued  at 44.5 degrees c until a half-maximum absorbance (at 420 nm) was reached. the time between the start of incubation and the half-maximum absorbance was proportional to the concentration of fecal coliforms present. escherichia coli (k-12) was used to measure the kinetics of substrate hydrolysis and the response  time of different cell concentrations. high cell densities produced an immediate  response, whereas 1 cell/ml will produce a response in less than 20 h. in field studies in which samples were taken from a range of grossly polluted streams to relatively clean lake water, a linear correlation between onpg hydrolysis times and fecal coliform most-probable-number values was established. a total of 302 isolates randomly selected from positive onpg-ec media, which were derived from 11 different habitats, were identified as e. coli (96.69 percent), enterobacter cloacae (2.32 percent), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.66 percent), and citrobacter freundii (0.33 percent).

TI  == lytic activity of a new cephalosporin, cefuroxime, against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == cefuroxime, a new cephalosporin antibiotic, was inhibitory at low concentrations  to several types of gram-negative bacteria. it was considerably more stable than  cephaloridine or cephalothin to the beta-lactamases produced by escherichia coli  (rp1), klebsiella aerogenes k1 and enterobacter cloacae p99. concentrations of cefuroxime much greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) were usually necessary to induce lysis of beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producers. in contrast, cephaloridine, cephalothin and ampicillin were rapidly bacteriolytic at, or near, the respective mic against non-beta-lactamase producers, whereas the activity of these three antibiotics was considerably reduced against beta-lactamase-producing strains.

TI  == enterotoxin-producing bacteria stools from swedish united nations soldiers in cyprus.
AB  == a study was designed to establish the role of heat-labile enterotoxin producing escherichia coli and other intestinal pathogens in diarrhoeal disease in swedish  soldiers of the united nations' force in cyprus. before leaving sweden for cyprus, no enteropathogens were isolated from the soldiers. the study was performed from october 1975 through january 1976 and in august 1976. enterotoxigenic strains of e. coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae were the intestinal pathogens most frequently isolated  from the cases of diarrhoea. such strains were found in 14 of 79 diarrhoeal cases (18%) but also in 6 of 66 (9%) of next-bed-fellow controls and in 7 of 139 (5%) of healthy cypriotic civilians. few other pathogens were identified in the soldiers, but 9 of 139 (6%) of the cypriots were carriers of cysts of giardia lamblia. the results indicate that enterotoxigenic bacteria were probably the most important cause of diarrhoea of those agents identified among the swedish un soldiers on cyprus. several soldiers were colonized with these strains without contracting diarrhoea.

TI  == host-dependent, thermosensitive replication of an r plasmid, pjy5, isolated from  enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == the thermosensitive replication of an r plasmid, pjy5, isolated from enterobacter cloacae, was studied. pjy5 consisted of 61 million daltons of covalently closed circular (ccc) deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) with a buoyant density of 1.714 g/cm3  (55 mol % guanine plus cytosine). in escherichia coli, this plasmid replicated stringently at 32 degrees c, but ceased its ccc dna replication after a short incubation at 42 degrees c, resulting in production of r- segregants. the thermosensitive replication of pjy5 was not overcome by the coexistence of non-thermosensitive r plasmids. the plasmid manifested an inhibitory effect on host bacterial cell growth at 42 degrees c, although the effect was less prominent than that of r plasmids belonging to the t-incompatibility group, rts1, r401, and r402. when the pjy5 plasmid was transferred into e. cloacae, however, no r- segregants were detected at any culture temperature, even 42 degrees c. alkaline sucrose gradient analysis revealed that a significant amount of pjy5 ccc dna was synthesized in e. cloacae at the high temperature but not in e. coli. furthermore, the growth-inhibitory effect of pjy5 on hosts at 42 degrees c was not observed in e. cloacae. on the other hand, rts1 and r401 were found to be thermosensitive in e. cloacae as well as in e. coli.

TI  == in vitro activities of five oral cephalosporins against aerobic pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == cefaclor (lilly 99638) and cefatrizine (bl-s640, sk&f 70771) are orally absorbed, broad-spectrum semisynthetic cephalosporins. they were compared in vitro with cephalexin, cephaloglycin, and cepharadine against a variety of aerobic pathogenic bacteria by an agar dilution procedure. cefaclor and cefatrizine were  found to be similar or superior to cephalexin, cephaloglycin, and cephradine in terms of activity against gram-positive cocci other than enterococci. only cefatrizine demonstrated any potentially useful activity against some susceptible isolates of enterococci. cefaclor and cefatrizine also were highly active, equally or more so than the other oral cephalosporins, against several gram-negative species including escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, and klebsiella pneumoniae. none of the cephalosporins were particularly active against enterobacter cloacae. both cefaclor and cefatrizine were active against proteus mirabilis; cefatrizine was uniquely active against indolepositive proteus species.

TI  == the growth and respiration of bacterial colonies.
AB  == young colonies of two swarming organisms, bacillus subtilis and proteus vulgaris, grew about as quickly on solid media as in liquid culture whilst four non-swarming organisms, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli and staphylococcus albus, all grew slower on solid than in liquid media. oxygen uptake by young colonies of b. subtilis, followed manometrically, increased exponentially at about the same rate as unrestricted aerobic growth. all other colonies demonstrated accelerating respiration which was either not strictly exponential or, in the case of s. albus, definitely biphasic, with a fast then a  slow exponential rate of increase. actual and potential respiration was determined for each species by measuring oxygen uptake before and after resuspending the colony in liquid medium. the ratio of actual to potential respiration was largest in the flat, spreading b. subtilis and smallest in the small, hemispherical s. albus. calculations suggest that oxygen penetrates between 31 and 41 micron into colonies of b. cereus, ent. cloacae and e. coli and only 9 micron into colonies of s. albus.

TI  == immunological interrelationships between cholera toxin and the heat-labile and heat-stable enterotoxins of coliform bacteria.
AB  == cholera toxin (ct) and the heat-labile (lt) toxin of escherichia coli are known to share antigenic properties. the present study examined the immunological relationship of ct and the lt and heat-stable (st) toxins of e. coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae. the neutralizing capacity of equine ct antiserum and of antiserum raised in rabbits to the lt toxin of the three species of coliform bacteria was evaluated by determining their capacity to inhibit the action of purified ct and semipurified ultrafiltration preparations of the coliform lt and st toxins in inducing water secretion as assayed by the in vivo marker perfusion technique in the rat jejunum. one milliliter of antiserum to ct  and to e. coli and klebsiella lt completely neutralized the secretory action of each of these three toxins; effective serial dilutions of ct antiserum extended to 1 to 4, whereas those of the antisera to lt were limited to 1 to 2 in most instances. one milliliter of antiserum to e. cloacae lt partially neutralized each of the three coliform lt toxins; serial dilutions were inactive. antiserum to e. cloacae lt did not neutralize ct. antiserum to ct and to each of the three  coliform lt toxins also had a weak neutralizing effect on the st toxins of e. coli and klebsiella, but they did not affect e. cloacae st. adsorption of the antiserum to ct and to each of the three lt toxins by incubation with a heat-inactivated preparation of either the homologous or a heterologous lt toxin  completely abolished the neutralizing capacity of the antisera towards both lt and st. these observations indicate that the immunological interrelationship of ct and e. coli lt extends to the lt toxins of klebsiella and e. cloacae and, further, that these immunological properties are shared to a lesser extent by the st toxins of e. coli and klebsiella.

TI  == a polyvalent human gamma-globulin immune to pseudomonas aeruginosa: passive protection of mice against lethal infection.
AB  == as a means to development of guidelines for therapeutic application to human disease, preparations of human polyvalent gamma-globulin immune to pseudomonas aeruginosa (pg) were studied in acute infections in mice. pg was highly effective in controlling lethal infections induced in mice by the major immunotypes of p. aeruginosa; greater than or equal to 10 microgram of of gamma-globulin per mouse  protected against challenge with less than or equal to 10(6) 50% lethal doses of  p. aeruginosa. pg was less than or equal to 57 times more effective than normal human gamma-globulin. the active antibody component is specific for each immunotype; it is of the igg type and undoubltedly is directed against the o-antigen. pg was was not protective against challenge with escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, or klebsiella pneumoniae; a low degree of cross-protection was seen against serratia marcescens. in a model infection involving mice in a terminal stage of advanced p. aeruginosa infection, human plasma immune to p. aeruginosa proved ineffective, but the gamma-globulin component showed moderate activity. the apparent irreversibility of this late-stage infection is not clearly ascribable to a toxin. it is postulated that  the successful treatment of advanced p. aeruginosa infections in humans would require multiple therapeutic approaches, including passive immunization with a high-potency, specifically immune globulin.

TI  == synergy between ticarcillin and tobramycin against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == the antibacterial activities of ticarcillin, carbenicillin, tobramycin, and gentamicin and of combinations of these antibiotics were measured against pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli in vitro and in experimental mouse infections. synergistic effects were produced by the penicillin/aminoglycoside combinations in growth inhibition tests and in bactericidal tests against many of the bacteria tested. combinations of ticarcillin + tobramycin were more active in vitro than carbenicillin + gentamicin against p. aeruginosa but were no more active than the latter against  other gram-negative bacilli. ticarcillin + tobramycin and carbenicillin + gentamicin also demonstrated synergistic activities against p. aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and enterobacter cloacae in experimental mouse infection models. thus, the penicillin/aminoglycoside combinations produced greater protective effects than the individual antibiotics against lethal intraperitoneal infections and also were more effective in reducing kidney counts of viable bacteria and kidney abscess formation in experimental pyelonephritis infections.  as was the case in vitro, ticarcillin + tobramycin was more effective than carbenicillin + gentamicin against the experimental p. aeruginosa infections. the results of these in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that combined therapy with  ticarcillin and tobramycin may be warranted in the treatment of serious infections due to p. aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae.

AB  == a novel beta-lactamase inhibitor has been isolated from streptomyces clavuligerus atcc 27064 and given the name clavulanic acid. conditions for the cultivation of  the organism and detection and isolation of clavulanic acid are described. this compound resembles the nucleus of a penicillin but differs in having no acylamino side chain, having oxygen instead of sulfur, and containing a beta-hydroxyethylidine substituent in the oxazolidine ring. clavulanic acid is a  potent inhibitor of many beta-lactamases, including those found in escherichia coli (plasmid mediated), klebsiella aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus, the inhibition being of a progressive type. the cephalosporinase type of beta-lactamase found in pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae p99 and the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of e. coli are less well inhibited. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin and  cephaloridine against beta-lactamase-producing, penicillin-resistant strains of s. aureus, k. aerogenes, p. mirabilis, and e. coli have been shown to be considerably reduced by the addition of low concentrations of clavulanic acid.

TI  == interference by neisseria gonorrhoeae growth by other bacterial species.
AB  == growth of neisseria gonorrhoeae from clinical specimens has been enhanced by the  use of selective media that inhibit the simultaneous growth of other microorganisms. one explanation for this enhancement could be that certain other  bacteria inhibit gonococcal growth. this hypothesis was examined by testing 167 bacterial isolates for in vitro gonococcal inhibition; 34.1% of the isolates failed to inhibit the gonococcus, but 12.0% produced weak inhibition and 53.9% strongly inhibited n. gonorrhoeae. the pattern of in vitro gonococcal inhibition  was consistently the same for all the individual isolates within some species, but individual isolates within other bacterial species varied in their ability to inhibit the gonococcus. consistently strong in vitro n. gonorrhoeae inhibitors were citrobacter diversus, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas. the in vivo significance of gonococcal interference was demonstrated in the subcutaneous chamber model of n. gonorrhoeae infection.

AB  == the regulatory properties of partially purified adenosine 5'-diphosphate-(adp) glucose pyrophosphorylase from two serratia marcescens strains (atcc 274 and atcc 15365) have been studied. slight or negligible activation by fructose-p2, pyridoxal-phosphate, or reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (nadph) was observed. these compounds were previously shown to be potent activators of the adpglucose pyrophosphorylases from the enterics, salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii,  escherichia aurescens, shigella dysenteriae, and escherichia coli. phosphoenolpyruvate stimulated the rate of adpglucose synthesis catalyzed by serratia adpglucose pyrophosphorylase about 1.5- to 2-fold but did not affect the s0.5 values (concentration of substrate required for 50% maximal stimulation) of  the substrates, alpha-glucose-1-phosphate, and adenosine 5'-triphosphate. adenosine 5'-monophosphate (amp), a potent inhibitor of the enteric adpglucose pyrophosphorylase, is an effective inhibitor of the s. marcescens enzyme. adp also inhibits but is not as effective as amp. activators of the enteric enzyme counteract the inhibition caused by amp. this is in contrast to what is observed  for the s. marcescens enzyme. neither phosphoenolpyruvate, fructose-diphosphate,  pyridoxal-phosphate, nadph, 3-phosphoglycerate, fructose-6-phosphate, nor pyruvate effect the inhibition caused by amp. the properties of the s. marcescens hy strain and serratia liquefaciens adpglucose pyrophosphorylase were found to be similar to the above two s. marcescens enzymes with respect to activation and inhibition. these observations provide another example where the properties of an enzyme found in the genus serratia have been found to be different from the properties of the same enzyme present in the enteric genera escherichia, salmonella, shigella, citrobacter, and enterobacter.

AB  == cell free preparations of the whole-cell lysate and ultrafiltration (uf) fractions of broth cultures of a strain of enterobacter cloacae, isolated from a  puerto rican with tropical sprue, were assayed for their ability to induce in vivo net water secretion in the rat jejunum. the whole-cell lysate and um-10 retentate of broth cultures were inactive. the um-2 retentate and filtrate were active at a concentration of 100 mug/ml or more; the toxigenic activity was entirely retained, and increased to 1 mug/ml, by a um-05 membrane; washing this retentate yielded a fraction with an activity of 10 ng/ml. stationary aerobic culture conditions yielded the most active uf fractions when ammonium sulfate was used as the precipitating agent, whereas anaerobic culture conditions produced the most active fractions in broth cultures precipitated by acetone. passage of the active acetone-precipitated uf fractions through a sephadex g-25 column yielded eluate pools with enhanced toxigenic activity in, or adjacent to, the void volume, but maximum activity of the ammonium sulfate-precipitated um-05 retentate eluated at a kav of 0.38 to 0.52. neither of the most active gel filtration elution fractions of the um-05 retentates contained detectable carbohydrate, suggesting that the toxin is not associated with endotoxin. toxigenic activity was unaltered by exposure to a temperature of 100c for 30 min, lowering the ph to 1, or incubation with either pronase or trypsin. these observations indicate that the strain of e. cloacae under study elaborates a heat-stable enterotoxin htat has approximately the same molecular weight and shares many of the characteristics of the heat-stable enterotoxin produced by some strains of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae.

AB  == we have previously shown that pupae of the giant silkmoth samia cynthia have a humoral antibacterial activity, which was induced by viable, nonpathogenic gram-negative bacteria (h.g. boman et al., 1974). we show here that this activity was formed simultaneously with a selective incorporation of amino acids into eight polypeptide chains characterized by their electrophoretic behavior. if actinomycin d or cycloheximide were given at an early time, no antibacterial activity was found. if the inhibitors were given at the time of maximum activity, there was no effect with actinomycin d but a rapid decrease of the activity in the case of cycloheximide. the results imply that the messenger ribonucleic acid  was stable, but that at least one protein component was turning over. hemolymph from immunized pupae of another giant silkmoth, hyalophora cecropia, was fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. this procedure, together with the isotope distribution after co-electrophoresis in polyarylamide gels, was used for comparing the response to injury and to different infections. almost identical polypeptide patterns were obtained as a response to an infection with either viable enterobacter cloacae or bacillus subtilis. these patterns differed both qualitatively and quantitatively from the injury effect created by an injection as such. there was only a low antibacterial activity in each of the four fractions obtained by ammonium sulfate precipitation. however, a combination of three fractions restored a high killing activity. fractionation of hemolymph from untreated pupae provided evidence for at least one preexisting factor which stimulated the killing of escherichia coli. the osmotic pressure of the bacteria  contributed to the antibacterial activity towards e. coli, but not towards b. subtitlis. the killing of e. coli was inhibited by liped a and, to a lesser extent, by an inhibitor of proteolytic enzymes. the similarities and differences  with the mammalian complement system are discussed.

TI  == antibodies against enteric bacteria in brown bullhead catfish (ictalurus nebulosus, lesueur) inhabiting contaminated waters.
AB  == brown bullhead catfish were collected from sewage- and acid mine waste-polluted waters in an attempt to detect antibodies against human enteric bacteria in their sera and to investigate the association of antibody response with environmental conditions. agglutination antigens prepared from isolates obtained from water collected at the same locations as the fish habitats were used to demonstrate such antibodies. the results showed large percentages of reactive sera for common isolates such as escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae as well as lesser incidences of antibodies to other, less common isolates. in general, fish with the highest titres were collected from habitats with higher coliform counts. acid mine drainage reduced the total coliform counts, but did not appear to affect the titers of sera from fish collected from water so affected. it was concluded that  the bottom-feeding catfish might be a better subject for the study of fish as an  ecological indicator of fecal pollution in acid-polluted waters.

AB  == cefatrizine (sk&f 60771), a new orally-active semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, was compared with cephalexin and cefazolin for in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetic behavior in laboratory animals. the average mic values obtained with cefatrizine against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were superior to those obtained with cephalexin and somewhat poorer than those of cefazolin. in addition, a large percentage of the enterobacter and enterococcus isolates were found to be susceptible. cefatrizine had a longer biological half-life and a higher peak serum level than either cefazolin or cephalexin when administered parenterally or orally to mice at 20 mg/kg. it had striking in vivo protective activity in mice infected with escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, hemophilus influenzae, proteus morganii or staphylococcus aureus reflecting its superior pharmacokinetic profile in this animal species. a  variable pharmacokinetic response between animal species was observed when cefatrizine was administered either orally or parenterally to dogs, squirrel monkeys or rabbits.

TI  == membrane filter procedure for enumerating the component genera of the coliform group in seawater.
AB  == a facile, quantitative, membrane filter procedure (mc) for defining the distribution of coliform populations in seawater according to the component genera was developed. the procedure, which utilizes a series of in situ substrate tests to obviate the picking of colonies for identification, also provides an estimate of the total coliform density. when pure cultures of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae were suspended in seawater and held at 4 c for 24 h, between 56 and 100% of the cells which grew on nutrient agar spread plates at 35 c could be recovered by the mc procedure. confirmation as coliforms of typical colonies from natural samples was about 95%. assay variability was found to be insignificant. the recovery of coliforms from marine  waters by the mc procedure was comparable to those obtainable by current methods. klebsiella was differentiated by the urease reaction and e. coli by its ability to form indole. the confirmation frequencies for colonies designated as klebsiella and e. coli by the in situ tests approached 95% for the former and 98% for the latter.

TI  == in-use contamination of intravenous infusion fluid.
AB  == during the 1970 to 1971 nationwide epidemic of septicemias caused by enterobacter cloacae and enterobacter agglomerans traced to intrinsic contamination of abbott  intravenous infusion products, 94 infusion systems manufactured by baxter laboratories were studied microbiologically and epidemiologically during hospital use. intravenous fluid from 10 systems (11%) contained microorganisms, usually staphylococcus or bacillus species; one infusion was heavily contaminated with klebsiella pneumoniae. no national epidemic organisms, e. cloacae or e. agglomerans (formerly erwinia), were recovered, suggesting that during this period frequent contamination with these organisms was unique to abbott's infusion products. contamination in this study appeared to be extrinsic in origin (introduced during clinical use) and related to the duration of continuous intravenous therapy. nine of 61 systems (15%) that had been used longer than 48 h were contaminated, whereas only 1 of 33 used less than 48 h (3%) contained microorganisms. this study and the recent national outbreak indicate that contamination of infusion fluid, both from intrinsic and extrinsic sources, must  be recognized as an additional risk of intravenous therapy; however, a once-daily replacement of the delivery apparatus can significantly diminish this hazard.

TI  == transferrable resistance to tobramycin in klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter  cloacae associated with enzymatic acetylation of tobramycin.
AB  == among gram-negative bacilli isolated from burn wound cultures, some strains of enterobacteriaceae were resistant to tobramycin (minimal inhibitory concentration [mic]>/= 20 mug/ml) but susceptible to gentamicin (mic </= 5 mug/ml). one klebsiella pneumoniae and two enterobacter cloacae strains were selected for studies on their mechanisms of resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics. resistance to high concentrations of tobramycin (mics of 25 to 50 mug/ml) was conjugally transferred to a susceptible escherichia coli strain at rates of 1.2 x 10(-4) to 2.8 to 10(-4) per donor cell, suggesting that resistance is controlled  by r factors. resistances to tobramycin, kanamycin, and neomycin were cotransferred. enzymatic activities were present that acetylated tobramycin, gentamicin, and kanamycin in osmotic lysates from the donor and transcipient strains. enzymatic adenylylation of these aminoglycosides was not observed. the aminoglycoside-acetylating activities from k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae resembled kanamycin acetyltransferase (kat) in their specificity for aminoglycoside substrates. not all isolates of bacteria that produce kat are resistant to tobramycin, but the factors that determine susceptibility or resistance to tobramycin in kat-producing bacteria have not yet been established.

TI  == insect immunity. i. characteristics of an inducible cell-free antibacterial reaction in hemolymph of samia cynthia pupae.
AB  == pupae of the silk moth, samia cynthia, were found to contain an inducible antibacterial activity in their hemolymph. this immunity response was provoked by primary infections with either escherichia coli k-12 or enterobacter cloacae. in  both cases the antibacterial activity was directed chiefly towards e. coli. during standard conditions, 1% of hemolymph could kill 10(3) to 10(4) viable e. coli, strain d31, within 5 min. a lower level of antibacterial activity was induced by injections of a sterile salt solution. the killing of strain d31 followed single-hit kinetics, and increasing rate constants were obtained for increasing amounts of hemolymph. the reaction was sensitive to pretreatment with  trypsin and it was protected by reducing agents. the activity was inhibited by microgram quantities of lipopolysaccharide (lps) prepared from certain lps mutants of e. coli k-12. a comparison of the susceptibility showed that "heptose-less" lps mutants were more sensitive to killing than other strains. during standard conditions hemolymph will lyse both e. coli and micrococcus lysodeikticus. lysis of e. coli followed a multi-hit kinetics and it was inhibited by lps, whereas lysis of m. lysodeikticus was unaffected by lps. hemolymph was fractionated on sephadex g-200, and the lytic activities were recovered in partly overlapping peaks. reconstitution with pooled fractions gave  synergistic effects with the killing assay.

TI  == cefoxitin, a semisynthetic cephamycin antibiotic: resistance to beta-lactamase inactivation.
AB  == cefoxitin is a new, cephalosporin-like antibiotic which is highly resistant to hydrolysis by beta-lactamase. ninety-one cultures were selected either for their  general resistance to cephalosporin antibiotics or for their ability to produce beta-lactamase. some of these cultures were resistant to cefoxitin. the capacity  of each of the 91 strains to hydrolyze cefoxitin with beta-lactamase was determined. only seven of the cultures degraded the antibiotic as determined by a general assay for beta-lactamase. several others were able to hydrolyze cefoxitin after enzyme was induced by low concentrations of the antibiotic. the role of the constitutive and inducible enzyme in bacterial resistance to the antibiotic was investigated. enzymatic destruction of cefoxitin was found to be an important factor contributing to bacterial resistance. however, the complete and rapid degradation of cefoxitin is not essential to resistance since one strain, enterobacter cloacae 1316, hydrolyzed the antibiotic very slowly but was able to  grow unaffected in the presence of cefoxitin. the presence of the enzyme is not necessarily sufficient to confer resistance since another culture, klebsiella d535, readily hydrolyzed the antibiotic but was susceptible to it.

TI  == enterobacteria in feedlot waste and runoff.
AB  == samples of beef cattle feedlot waste (flw), runoff from the pens, and water from  a large drainage ditch at the feedlot were examined for enterobacteriaceae. the drainage ditch receives the runoff but contains primarily subsurface drainage from fields on which flw is spread for disposal. planting and enrichment techniques with seven different media were used to isolate 553 cultures of enterobacteria. flw contains about 50 million enterobacteria/g dry weight. more than 90% of these were escherichia coli, none of which were enteropathogenic types as determined with multivalent sera. citrobacter and enterobacter cloacae were other organisms present in moderate numbers. application of enrichment techniques broadened the spectrum of enterobacteria isolates to include the four  proteus spp., both providencia spp., klebsiella, enterobacter aerogenes, arizona, and a single isolate of salmonella (serological group c(2)). shigella was not isolated. the wide spectrum of enterobacteria in flw may be a hazard if unsterilized waste is refed. fewer enterobacteria occurred in the runoff and in the drainage ditch; the most numerous species in flw also were most numerous at these sites. however, neither salmonella nor arizona was isolated from runoff or  drainage-ditch waters.

AB  == the occurrence of a chloramphenicol-acetylating enzyme, similar to that found in  escherichia coli, carrying an r factor was investigated in various gram-negative  bacilli. the acetylated products of chloramphenicol were identified by chromatography and quantitatively assayed after benzene extraction. the investigated strains were of the salmonella-arizona group, the klebsiella-aerobacter group, serratia marcescens, the proteus group, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, most of which were isolated from 1947 to 1957. both chloramphenicol-sensitive and -resistant strains were included, but none of them  was able to transfer chloramphenicol resistance by conjugation. in the proteus group, a significant level of a chloramphenicol-acetylating enzyme was found in most strains, whether they were sensitive or resistant to chloramphenicol; the resistant strains showed higher levels of the enzyme. some chloramphenicol-sensitive strains lacked this enzyme. only the sensitive strains  containing the enzyme could easily produce chloramphenicol-resistant mutants with higher enzyme activity. thus, the chloramphenicol resistance of this group can be reasonably explained on the basis of the chloramphenicol-acetylating enzyme. all  of the pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were resistant to chloramphenicol, and most strains showed low levels of the enzyme (which, however, did not appear sufficient to explain their resistance). all of the strains of the other groups (except one strain of enterobacter cloacae) lacked the enzyme, although most strains of the klebsiella-aerobacter group and of s. marcescens were resistant to chloramphenicol. with respect to the origin of the resistance gene of the r factor, it is noteworthy that the strains of proteus mirabilis isolated in 1947 possessed this enzyme before the discovery of chloramphenicol.

AB  == cultures of coliform and proteus bacteria, mostly from foods, were tested for their effect on growth of staphylococcus aureus in trypticase soy broth. inhibition of the staphylococcus by these competitors increased with increasing proportions of inhibiting (effector) bacteria in the inoculum and decreasing incubation temperatures (37 to 10 c). time required for 2 x 10(4) staphylococci to increase to 5 x 10(6) cells per milliliter, the minimal number assumed to be necessary for food poisoning, varied with the species of effector, the original ratio of effector bacteria to staphylococci in the medium, and the incubation temperature. when the original ratio was 100:1, the staphylococci did not reach 5 x 10(6) cells per milliliter at 10, 15, 22, or 30 c (with one exception), when growing with cultures representing six species of coliform bacteria and two of proteus. when the ratio was 1:1, all effectors either greatly delayed the staphylococcus or prevented it from reaching hazardous numbers at 15 c, six of the eight caused a delay of 2 to 3 hr at 22 c, and only escherichia coli delayed  the coccus at 30 c. all effectors were ineffective at 22 and 30 c when original numbers of effectors and staphylococci were in the ratio 1:100. greatest overall  inhibition was by e. coli, e. freundii, and proteus vulgaris, and these species were more effective than the others at 22 and 30 c. aerobacter cloacae and paracolobactrum aerogenoides were more effective at 15 c. in general, results were similar with different strains of a species. except for aerobacter aerogenes, klebsiella sp., and p. aerogenoides, which apparently did not compete  for nutrients, inhibition of the staphylococcus was by a combination of antibiotic substances and competition for nutrients.

AB  == a study of the coliforms found on sugarcane plants throughout the growing season  indicated that members of the genus aerobacter comprise a part of the epiphytic microflora. when quantitative determinations were made of the coliforms by means  of the most probable number technique, no completed tests were obtained on young  sugarcane plants during the test period of february through may; however, paracolobactrum aerogenoides was isolated frequently. nine different imvic types  of coliforms were identified among the 198 isolates chosen for study. the predominating coliform found at the top, middle, and bottom portions of the sugarcane plants was a. cloacae, but the type predominating in leaf-sheath water  was a. aerogenes. only once was escherichia coli found associated with the plants at the high dilutions necessary for determining most probable numbers. the numbers of different coliforms occurring in sugarcane juice were generally divided equally among a. aerogenes, a. cloacae, and e. coli. more variety among the imvic types seemed to occur on the cane plants than in the leaf-sheath water  or the cane juice in the mill.
