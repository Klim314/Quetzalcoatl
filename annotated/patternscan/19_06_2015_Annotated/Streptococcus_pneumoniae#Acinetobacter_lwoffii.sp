TI  == the use of multiplex real-time pcr improves the detection of the bacterial etiology of community acquired pneumonia.
AB  == community-acquired pneumonia (cap) is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality especially to children and compromised hosts, such as the old and those with underlying chronic diseases. knowledge of pathogens causing cap constitutes  the basis for selection of antimicrobial treatment. previous data have shown that etiological agents can be identified in only up to 50% of patients, but this figure can be improved by using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). this study was designed to evaluate multiplex real-time pcr as a method for rapid differential detection of five bacterial causes of cap (streptococcus pneumoniae, burkholderia pseudomallei and atypical bacterial pathogens namely mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydophila pneumoniae and legionella pneumophila) in cap patients attending hospital tengku ampuan afzan (htaa)/ kuantan, pahang, malaysia. two previously developed multiplex real-time pcr assays, duplex for the differential detection of s. pneumoniae and b. pseudomallei and triplex for the atypical bacterial pathogens, were used to detect a bacterial cause of cap in blood and respiratory  samples. thus, 46 blood and 45 respiratory samples collected from 46 adult cap patients admitted to htaa were analysed by multiplex real-time pcr assays and conventional methods. the microbial etiology of cap could be established for 39.1% (18/46) of cap patients by conventional methods and this was increased to 65.2% (30/46) with the additional use of real-time pcr. the most frequently detected pathogens were s. pneumoniae (21.7% - all by pcr alone), klebsiella pneumoniae (17.3%), b. pseudomallei (13% - 83% of them positive by pcr alone and  17% by both culture and pcr), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.5%), m. pneumoniae (6.5%  - all by serology), c. pneumoniae (4.3% - all positive by both pcr and serology), l. pneumophila (2.1% - all by pcr alone), escherichia coli (4.3%). haemophilus infuenzae, acinetobacter lwoffii and acinetobacter baumannii were detected by conventional methods (2.1% for each).

TI  == antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil and methanol extracts of achillea millefolium subsp. millefolium afan. (asteraceae).
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of the essential oil and methanol extracts of achillea millefolium subsp. millefolium afan. (asteraceae) were investigated. gc-ms analysis of the essential oil resulted in the identification of 36 compounds constituting 90.8% of the total oil. eucalyptol, camphor, alpha-terpineol, beta-pinene, and borneol were the principal components  comprising 60.7% of the oil. the oil strongly reduced the diphenylpicrylhydrazyl  radical (ic(50)=1.56 micro g/ml) and exhibited hydroxyl radical scavenging effect in the fe(3+)-edta-h(2)o(2) deoxyribose system (ic(50)=2.7 micro g/ml). it also inhibited the nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation of rat liver homogenate (ic(50)=13.5 micro g/ml). the polar phase of the extract showed antioxidant activity. the oil showed antimicrobial activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, mycobacterium smegmatis, acinetobacter lwoffii and candida krusei while water-insoluble parts of the methanolic extracts exhibited slight or no activity. this study confirms that the essential oil of achillea millefolium possesses antioxidant and antimicrobial properties in vitro.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == [clinical examination of ceftibuten in acute bronchitis].
AB  == clinical evaluation of ceftibuten (cetb, 7432-s) was performed in 20 patients with acute bronchitis. they were consisted of 10 males and 10 females aged from 20 to 80 years old. cetb was given orally in daily dose of 300 mg (18 cases) or 600 mg (2 cases) in three divided portions. the duration of administration was 3  to 14 days. especially they were given for 7 days in 16 cases. a total of 11 strains comprising 4 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 2 strains of beta-streptococcus and 1 strain each of streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii were  identified from sputa before administration. all of the above bacteria were eradicated but, in 1 case, a strain of streptococcus pyogenes appeared after the  treatment (eradication ratio = 100%). the clinical efficacy rate was 100%: responses were excellent in 3 cases and good in 17 cases. there was no side effect and no abnormal changes in laboratory test results. from the avobe results, it is concluded that cetb is effective, safe and useful new oral cephem  on acute bronchitis.
