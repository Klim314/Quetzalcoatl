arsh is an organoarsenical oxidase that confers resistance to trivalent forms of  the herbicide monosodium methylarsenate and the poultry growth promoter roxarsone.
environmental organoarsenicals are produced by microorganisms and are introduced  anthropogenically as herbicides and antimicrobial growth promoters for poultry and swine. nearly every prokaryote has an ars (arsenic resistance) operon, and some have an arsh gene encoding an atypical flavodoxin. the role of arsh in arsenic resistance has been unclear. here we demonstrate that arsh is an organoarsenical oxidase that detoxifies trivalent methylated and aromatic arsenicals by oxidation to pentavalent species. escherichia coli, which does not have an arsh gene, is very sensitive to the trivalent forms of the herbicide monosodium methylarsenate [msma or mas(v)] and antimicrobial growth promoter roxarsone [rox(v)], as well as to phenylarsenite [phas(iii), also called phenylarsine oxide or pao]. pseudomonas putida has two chromosomally encoded arsh genes and is highly resistant to the trivalent forms of these organoarsenicals. a derivative of p. putida with both arsh genes deleted is sensitive to mas(iii), phas(iii) or rox(iii). p. putida arsh expressed in e. coli conferred resistance to each trivalent organoarsenical. cells expressing pparsh oxidized the trivalent organoarsenicals. pparsh was purified, and the enzyme in vitro similarly oxidized the trivalent organoarsenicals. these results suggest that arsh catalyzes a novel biotransformation that confers resistance to environmental methylated and aromatic arsenicals.
detoxification of the veterinary antibiotic chloramphenicol using electron beam irradiation.
electron beam irradiation has shown potential as an alternative process for the treatment of industrial effluents that contain toxic organic chemicals. this study investigated the effectiveness of electron beam in degrading chloramphenicol (cap) in aqueous solution. the degradation efficiency was 32.4 % at 1 kgy, 86.9 % at 5 kgy, and 100 % at 10 kgy. the total organic carbon (toc) of cap in aqueous solution declined 4.6 % at 1 kgy, 12.1 % at 5 kgy, and 17.1 % at 10 kgy of irradiation with electron beam. the cap degradation products after irradiation were cap1 ([m + h] m/z 307.1), cap2 ([m + h] m/z 291.1), and cap3 ([m + h] m/z 321.1). the degradation products were tested for microbial toxicity against escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, and bacillus subtilis and did not show any toxic antimicrobial effects caused by the cap degradation products after irradiation with electron beam. the results of this study suggest that electron beam irradiation is the best technology for the comprehensive treatment of veterinary antibiotics at wastewater treatment plants.
detection and characterization of a bacteriocin, putadicin t01, produced by pseudomonas putida isolated from hot spring water.
pseudomonas strains isolated from hot spring water were tested for bacteriocin-like substance (bls) production using a target panel of closely related microorganisms and other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. molecular identification was carried out through specific pcr and 16s rna sequence analysis. isolates were identified as brevundimonas diminuta and pseudomonas putida, the latter exhibited antimicrobial activity. pseudomonas putida strains produce an inhibitory substance against other pseudomonas strains and other species including food-borne pathogens. the bls was sensitive to the proteolytic action of proteinase k, pronase e and trypsin but resistant to alpha-amylase, rnase and lipase c, reflecting its proteinaceous nature. the bls was stable at 100 degrees c and also after thermal treatment at 121 degrees c for 15 min. additionally, it was stable within a wide range of ph (2-10). the substance from p. putida t01 strain was bactericidal to escherichia coli. sds-page analysis of the partial purified supernatant of strain t01 revealed a bls with an approximate molecular mass of 8 kda. therefore, the results of this study show that p. putida strain t01 produces a bls with a higher activity spectrum, which may find application in human medicine and in minimally processed food preservation.
decomposition reaction of the veterinary antibiotic ciprofloxacin using electron  ionizing energy.
the application of electron ionizing energy for degrading veterinary antibiotic ciprofloxacin (cfx) in aqueous solution was elucidated. the degradation efficiency of cfx after irradiation with electron ionizing energy was 38% at 1 kgy, 80% at 5kgy, and 97% at 10 kgy. total organic carbon of cfx in aqueous solution after irradiation with electron ionizing energy decreased 2% at 1 kgy, 18% at 5 kgy, and 53% at 10 kgy. the cfx degradation products after irradiation with electron ionizing energy were cfx1 ([m+h] m/z 330), cfx2 ([m+h] m/z 314), and cfx3 ([m+h] m/z 263). cfx1 had an f atom substituted with oh and cfx2 was expected to originate from cfx via loss of f or h2o. cfx3 was expected to originate from cfx via loss of the piperazynilic ring. among the several radicals, hydrate electron (eaq(-)) is expected to play an important role in degradation of veterinary antibiotic during irradiation with electron ionizing energy. the toxicity of the degraded products formed during irradiation with electron ionizing energy was evaluated using microbes such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, and bacillus subtilis, and the results revealed that the toxicity decreased with irradiation. these results demonstrate that irradiation technology using electron ionizing energy is an effective was to remove veterinary antibiotics from an aquatic ecosystem.
biochemical and structural analysis of rraa proteins to decipher their relationships with 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-oxoglutarate/4-carboxy-4-hydroxy-2-oxoadipate aldolases.
4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-oxoglutarate (hmg)/4-carboxy-4-hydroxy-2-oxoadipate (cha) aldolases are class ii (divalent metal ion dependent) pyruvate aldolases from the meta cleavage pathways of protocatechuate and gallate. the enzyme from pseudomonas putida f1 is structurally similar to a group of proteins termed regulators of rnase e activity a (rraa) that bind to the regulatory domain of rnase e and inhibit the ribonuclease activity in certain bacteria. analysis of homologous rraa-like proteins from varying species revealed that they share sequence conservation within the active site of hmg/cha aldolase. in particular, the p. putida f1 hmg/cha aldolase has a d-x20-r-d motif, whereas a g-x20-r-d-x2-e/d motif is observed in the structures of the rraa-like proteins from thermus thermophilus hb8 (ttrraa) and saccharomyces cerevisiae s288c (yer010cp) that may support metal binding. ttrraa and yer010cp were found to contain hmg aldolase and oxaloacetate decarboxylase activities. similar to the p. putida f1 hmg/cha aldolase, both ttrraa and yer010cp enzymes required divalent metal ions for activity and were competitively inhibited by oxalate, a pyruvate enolate analogue, suggesting a common mechanism among the enzymes. the rraa from escherichia coli (ecrraa) lacked detectable c-c lyase activity. upon restoration of the g-x20-r-d-x2-e/d motif, by site-specific mutagenesis, the ecrraa variant was able to catalyze oxaloacetate decarboxylation. sequence analysis of rraa-like gene products found across all the domains of life revealed conservation of the metal binding motifs that can likely support a divalent metal ion-dependent enzyme reaction either in addition to or in place of the putative rraa function.
particle-cell contact enhances antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticles.
background: it is generally accepted that antibacterial properties of ag nanoparticles (agnps) are dictated by their dissolved fraction. however, dissolution-based concept alone does not fully explain the toxic potency of nanoparticulate silver compared to silver ions. methodology/principal findings: herein, we demonstrated that the direct contact between bacterial cell and agnps' surface enhanced the toxicity of nanosilver. more specifically, cell-np contact increased the cellular uptake of particle-associated ag ions - the single and ultimate cause of toxicity. to prove that, we evaluated the toxicity of three different agnps (uncoated, pvp-coated and protein-coated) to six bacterial strains: gram-negative escherichia coli, pseudomonas fluorescens, p. putida and p. aeruginosa and gram-positive bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus. while the toxicity of agno3 to these bacteria varied only slightly (the 4-h ec50 ranged from 0.3 to 1.2 mg ag/l), the 4-h ec50 values of protein-coated agnps for various bacterial strains differed remarkably, from 0.35 to 46 mg ag/l. by systematically comparing the intracellular and extracellular free ag(+) liberated from agnps, we demonstrated that not only extracellular dissolution in the bacterial test environment but also additional dissolution taking place at the particle-cell interface played an essential role in antibacterial action of agnps. the role of the np-cell contact in dictating the antibacterial activity of ag-nps was additionally proven by the following observations: (i) separation of bacterial cells from agnps by particle-impermeable membrane (cut-off 20 kda, approximately 4 nm) significantly reduced the toxicity of agnps and (ii) p. aeruginosa cells which tended to attach onto agnps, exhibited the highest sensitivity to all forms of nanoparticulate ag. conclusions/significance: our findings provide new insights into the mode of antibacterial action of nanosilver and explain some discrepancies in this field, showing that "ag-ion" and "particle-specific" mechanisms are not controversial but, rather, are two faces of the same coin.
inhibitory effect of pseudomonas putida nitrogen-related phosphotransferase system on conjugative transfer of incp-9 plasmid from escherichia coli.
conjugative plasmid transfer systems have been well studied, but very little is known about the recipient factors that control horizontal transmission. a self-transmissible incp-9 naphthalene catabolic plasmid, nah7, carries the traf gene, whose product is considered to be a host-range modifier of nah7, because its traf deletion mutant (nah7df) is transmissible from pseudomonas putida to p. putida and escherichia coli and from e. coli to e. coli, but not from e. coli to p. putida. in this study, transposon mutagenesis of p. putida kt2440 was performed to isolate the mutants that could receive nah7df from e. coli. the mutants had the transposon insertions in ptsp or ptso, encoding two of three components of the nitrogen-related phosphotransferase system (pts(ntr) ). the kt2440 derivative lacking ptsn, encoding the remaining component of pts(ntr) , was also able to receive nah7df. these results indicated that the pts(ntr) in p. putida is involved in inhibition of conjugative transfer of nah7df from e. coli. our further experiments using site-directed mutants suggested the indirect involvement of the phosphorylated form of ptso in the inhibition of the conjugative transfer. conjugative transfer of nah7 and another incp-9 plasmid, pww0, from e. coli was partially inhibited by the ptso function in kt2440.
effects of shear on initial bacterial attachment in slow flowing systems.
initial bacterial attachment, likely affected by local shear, could influence biofilm formation. however, there are contradictory reports for the shear effects on attachment of different bacteria onto different surfaces. in this study, four bacteria, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, and escherichia coli, were examined for their attachment to glass and octadecyltrichlorosilane (ots) modified glass under different shears. polystyrene particles were used to verify that their shear dependent attachment on glass and ots could be interpreted using an analysis based on the extended derjaguin-landau-verwey-overbeek (xdlvo) theory. in particular, the critical shear force (f(c-shear)) could correlate with the maximum attractive force (f(max)(xdlvo)) toward the secondary energy minimum as f(c-shear)=cf(max)(xdlvo). for these particles, c of ~1 was obtained, the value was within the coefficient range (0.1-1) of substances sliding over glass. for s. epidermidis, e. coli and p. aeruginosa on glass, c was 0.3, <0.6 and 0.2, respectively. when considering potential protein adsorption on ots during bacterial attachment, c of these species on ots was slightly above 1. a greatly enhanced attachment of p. aeruginosa on ots was also observed, probably due to the presence of flagella. for p. putida, the attachment first decreased slightly or maintained with shear and then increased. such behaviors were probably caused by the increased secretion of extracellular polymeric substances (eps) at higher shears by p. putida. the results from this study suggested that, without complications from surface features/eps, the analysis based on the xdlvo theory could provide a basis for understanding shear effect on initial bacterial attachment.
targeted disinfection of e. coli via bioconjugation to photoreactive tio2.
the selective control of pathogenic bacteria is an ongoing challenge. a strategy  is proposed that combines targeted binding of the bacterium, using antibodies, with their photoactivated oxidative destruction. photoactive colloidal tio2 was first derivatized with e. coli antibodies (ea-tio2). when mixtures of the organisms e. coli and pseudomonas putida ( p. putida ) were exposed to modified ea-tio2, the particles preferentially selected e. coli for surface binding. two consequences arose from surface bioconjugation: bacteria were found to flocculate upon mixing at appropriate ratios of ea-tio2/ e. coli , and ea-tio2-bound e. coli underwent cell death after exposure to uv light. in the former case, flocculation of the bacteria was optimal at ~50 ea-tio2 particles per e. coli . selective flocculation provides an alternative strategy for pathogen removal. with respect to uv disinfection, as few as 26 ea-tio2 particles per e. coli gave a 10 000-fold decrease in viable bacteria. thus, it is possible to selectively target and kill one type of bacteria in a mixture of pathogens. the results give support to the proposal that photocatalytic tio2 most effectively delivers an oxidizing agent when the titania is bound to the bacterial surface.
proteomic analysis of pseudomonas putida reveals an organic solvent tolerance-related gene mmsb.
organic solvents are toxic to most microorganisms. however, some organic-solvent-tolerant (ost) bacteria tolerate the destructive effects of organic solvent through various accommodative mechanisms. in this work, we developed an ost adapted strain pseudomonas putida juct1 that could grow in the presence of 60% (v/v) cyclohexane. two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to compare and analyze the total cellular protein of p. putida juct1 growing with or without 60% (v/v) cyclohexane. under different solvent conditions, five high-abundance protein spots whose intensity values show over 60% discrepancies were identified by maldi-tof/tof spectra. specifically, they are arginine deiminase, carbon-nitrogen hydrolase family putative hydrolase, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase, protein chain elongation factor ef-ts, and isochorismatase superfamily hydrolase. the corresponding genes of the latter three proteins, mmsb, tsf, and pseen0851, were separately expressed in escherichia coli to evaluate their effect on ost properties of the host strain. in the presence of 4% (v/v) cyclohexane, e. coli harboring mmsb could grow to 1.70 od(660), whereas cell growth of e. coli jm109 (the control) was completely inhibited by 2% (v/v) cyclohexane. transformants carrying tsf or pseen0851 also showed an increased resistance to cyclohexane and other organic solvents compared with the control. of these three genes, mmsb exhibited the most prominent effect on increasing ost of e. coli. less oxidation product of cyclohexane was detected because mmsb transformants might help keep a lower intracellular cyclohexane level. this study demonstrates a feasible approach for elucidating ost mechanisms of microorganisms, and provides molecular basis to construct organic-solvent-tolerant strains for industrial applications.
bacteriostatic effect of sequential hydrodynamic and ultrasound-induced stress.
aims: to elucidate the mechanism of action of a nonchemical microbial control technology employing coupled hydrodynamic and ultrasound-induced stress. methods & results: the effects of a laboratory model system using a commercial nonchemical device on pseudomonas putida revealed growth and respiration were inhibited without a loss of viability from the treated population. damage to cell membranes was evident using fluorescent microscopy and a reporter strain containing lux genes fused with a membrane damage stress-response promoter. other reporter strains also indicated the possible involvement of dna and protein repair systems. a consequence of treatment was a reduced ability to form biofilms. conclusions: the nonchemical device caused a biostatic effect on treated cells induced by sublethal damage to several cellular systems, including cell membranes. significance and impact of the study: the study demonstrates that biostasis can be an effective mechanism for microbial control in some industrial systems and provides insight into understanding and applying this device and other nonchemical microbial control technologies to real-world problems of microbial contamination.
effect of rhamnolipids on initial attachment of bacteria on glass and octadecyltrichlorosilane-modified glass.
bacterial attachment on solid surfaces has various implications in environmental, industrial and medical applications. in this study, the effects of rhamnolipid biosurfactants on initial attachment of bacteria on hydrophilic glass and hydrophobic octadecyltrichlorosilane (ots) modified glass were evaluated under continuous-flow conditions. the bacteria investigated were three gram-negative species pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, and escherichia coli, and two gram-positive species staphylcoccus epidermidis and bacillus subtilis. rhamnolipids, at 10 and 200 mg/l, significantly reduced the attachment of all but s. epidermidis on both glass and ots-modified glass. for s. epidermidis rhamnolipids reduced the attachment on ots-modified glass but not on glass. studies were further done to identify the mechanism(s) by which rhamnolipids reduced the cell attachment. the following potential properties of rhamnolipids were investigated: inhibition of microbial growth, change of cell surface hydrophobicity, easier detachment of cells already attached to substratum, and modification of substratum surface properties. results showed that rhamnolipids were ineffective for the latter two effects. rhamnolipids, up to 200mg/l, inhibited the growth of b. subtilis, s. epidermidis and p. aeruginosa pao1 but not the growth of e. coli, p. putida and p. aeruginosa e0340. also, rhamnolipids tended to increase the hydrophobicity of p. aeruginosa pao1 and e. coli, decrease the hydrophobicity of p. putida and s. epidermidis, and have no clear effect on the hydrophobicity of b. subtillis. these trends however did not correlate with the observed trend of cell attachment reduction. the responsible mechanism(s) remained unknown.
ecotoxicity and biodegradability of antielectrostatic dicephalic cationic surfactants.
four series of dicephalic cationic surfactants, considered as new antielectrostatic agents have been investigated in order to establish their toxicity and biodegradability. among them n,n-bis[3,3'-(dimethylamine)propyl]alkylamides, n,n-bis[3,3'-(dimethylamine)propyl]alkylamide dihydrochlorides, n,n-bis[3,3'-(trimethylammonio)propyl]alkylamide dibromides and n,n-bis[3,3'-(trimethylammonio)propyl]alkylamide dimethylsulphates with different hydrophobic chain length (n-c(9)h(19) to n-c(15)h(31)) and type of counterion (chloride, bromide and methylsulfate) have been studied. the inhibitory effect against microorganisms has been examined using model gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, and yeasts. none of the tested surfactants have shown antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida) and yeasts (saccharomyces cerevisiae, rhodotorula glutinis) at a concentration below 1000 mug ml(-1), however some of them were moderately active against gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis). the microtox(r) test was successfully applied to measure ec(50) values of the studied dicephalic cationic surfactants. their toxicity to vibrio fischeri depended upon the alkanoyl chain length with the ec(50) values in a range of 2.6-980 mg l(-1). n,n-bis[3,3'-(dimethylamine)propyl]alkylamide dihydrochlorides 2a-b and n,n-bis[3,3'-(trimethylammonio)propyl]alkylamide dibromides 3a-b comprising n-decanoyl and n-dodecanoyl hydrophobic tails appeared to be the least toxic. furthermore, the biodegradability under aerobic conditions of 2a-b, 3a-b was evaluated using oecd method 301f. according to the obtained results 2a, 3a-3b can be considered as almost readily biodegradable and they are not expected to be persistent in the environment. additionally, partial biodegradation was observed for 2b, indicating its possible biodegradation in wastewater treatment systems.
novel polymer anchored cr(iii) schiff base complexes: synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial properties.
new polymer-bound schiff bases and cr(iii) complexes have been synthesized by the reaction of 4-benzyloxybenzaldehyde, polymer-bound with 2-aminophenol, 2-amino-4-chlorophenol and 2-amino-4-methylphenol. the structure of polymeric-schiff bases and their cr(iii) complexes have been characterized by elemental analyses, magnetic measurements, ir, uv-vis, tg-dta and (1)h-nmr. all these compounds have also been investigated for antibacterial activity by the well-diffusion method against staphylococcus aureus (rskk-07035), shigella dysenteria type 10 (rskk 1036), listeria monocytogenes 4b(atcc 19115, escherichia coli (atcc 1230), salmonella typhi h (nctc 901.8394), staphylococcus epidermis (atcc 12228), brucella abortus (rskk-03026), micrococcs luteus (atcc 93419, bacillus cereus sp., pseudomonas putida sp. and for antifungal activity against candida albicans (y-1200-nih).
fis regulates the competitiveness of pseudomonas putida on barley roots by inducing biofilm formation.
an important link between the environment and the physiological state of bacteria is the regulation of the transcription of a large number of genes by global transcription factors. one of the global regulators, fis (factor for inversion stimulation), is well studied in escherichia coli, but the role of this protein in pseudomonads has only been examined briefly. according to studies in enterobacteriaceae, fis regulates positively the flagellar movement of bacteria. in pseudomonads, flagellar movement is an important trait for the colonization of plant roots. therefore we were interested in the role of the fis protein in pseudomonas putida, especially the possible regulation of the colonization of plant roots. we observed that fis reduced the migration of p. putida onto the apices of barley roots and thereby the competitiveness of bacteria on the roots. moreover, we observed that overexpression of fis drastically reduced swimming motility and facilitated p. putida biofilm formation, which could be the reason for the decreased migration of bacteria onto the root apices. it is possible that the elevated expression of fis is important in the adaptation of p. putida during colonization of plant roots by promoting biofilm formation when the migration of bacteria is no longer favoured.
optimization of fenton process for decoloration and cod removal in tobacco wastewater and toxicological evaluation of the effluent.
decoloration and chemical oxygen demand (cod) removal in tobacco wastewater by fenton process has been optimized under 25 +/- 2 degrees c. the results showed that the optimal range of conditions were ph 4.13-4.66, fe(2+) 0.29-0.34 g/l and h2o2 > or = 2.73 g/l. within this range, up to 95% of colour and 90% of cod was removed. in an enlarged system, setting the optimal conditions as ph 4.50, fe(2+) 0.34 g/l and h2o2 4.00 g/l, the colour removal rate was 96.03 +/- 2.57%, with cod removal rate of 93.30 +/- 2.92%. the residual cod of 73.67 +/- 19.70 mg/l in effluent had hit the state's first-class standard for the industrial discharge in china (< 100 mg/l cod, gb8978-1996). the ecological safety of fenton process has also been evaluated. when reaction completed, the content of hydroxyl free radical (oh) was 3.26 +/- 0.44 mg/l. there was no inhibition of fenton effluent in growth of escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas sp. hf-1, acinetobacter sp. tw and sphingomonas sp. ty. no oxidative stress was induced on strain hf-1 by fenton effluent. thus, fenton process was one of high-efficiency and ecologically safe strategy for tobacco wastewater advanced treatment.
idling time of motile bacteria contributes to retardation and dispersion in sand  porous medium.
the motility of microorganisms affects their transport in natural systems by altering their interactions with the solid phase of the soil matrix. to assess the effect of these interactions on transport parameters, a series of breakthrough curves (btcs) for motile and nonmotile bacteria, including e. coli and p. putida species, were measured from a homogeneously packed sand column under three different interstitial velocities of 1 m/d, 5 m/d, and 10 m/d. btcs for the nonmotile bacteria were nearly identical for all three flow rates, except that the recovery percentage at 1 m/d was reduced by 5% compared to the higher flow rates. in contrast, for the motile bacteria, the recovery percentages were not affected by flow rate, but their btcs exhibited a higher degree of retardation and dispersion as the flow velocity decreased, which was consistent with increased idling times of the motile strains. the smooth-swimming mutant e. coli hcb437, which is unable to change its swimming direction after encountering the solid surfaces and thus has the largest idling time, also exhibited the greatest degree of retardation and dispersion. all of the experimental observations were compared to results from an advection-dispersion transport model with three fitting parameters: retardation factor (r), longitudinal dispersivity (alpha(l)), and attachment rate coefficient (k(att)). in addition, the single-collector efficiency (eta(0)) and collision efficiency (alpha) were calculated according to the colloid filtration theory (cft), and confirmed that motile bacteria had lower collision efficiencies than nonmotile bacteria. this is consistent with previously reported observations that motile bacteria can avoid attachment to a solid surface by their active swimming capabilities. by quantifying the effect of bacterial motility on various transport parameters, more robust fate and transport models can be developed for decision-making related to environmental remediation strategies and risk assessment.
complex evaluation of ecotoxicity and genotoxicity of antimicrobials oxytetracycline and flumequine used in aquaculture.
ecotoxicity and genotoxicity of widely used veterinary antimicrobials oxytetracycline and flumequine was studied with six model organisms (vibrio fischeri, pseudomonas putida, pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, lemna minor, daphnia magna, escherichia coli). overall median effective concentration (ec50) values ranged from 0.22 mg/l to 86 mg/l. pseudomonas putida was the most sensitive organism (ec50 values for 16-h growth inhibition were 0.22 and 0.82 mg/l for oxytetracycline and flumequine, respectively), followed by duckweed lemna minor (7-d growth inhibition, ec50 2.1 and 3.0 mg/l) and green alga pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (4-d growth inhibition, ec50 3.1 and 2.6 mg/l). the least sensitive organism was daphnia magna (48-h immobilization, lowest-observed-effect concentration [loec] of oxytetracycline of 400 mg/l). oxytetracycline showed limited genotoxicity (sos-chromotest with escherichia coli, minimal genotoxic concentration of 500 mg/l), and flumequine was genotoxic at 0.25 mg/l. based on the reported measured concentrations (mecs) and predicted no-effect concentrations (pnecs), oxytetracycline may be concluded to be of ecotoxicological concern (calculated risk quotient = 8), whereas flumequine seems to represent lower risk.
stability, bioavailability, and bacterial toxicity of zno and iron-doped zno nanoparticles in aquatic media.
the stability and bioavailability of nanoparticles is governed by the interfacial properties that nanoparticles acquire when immersed in a particular aquatic media as well as the type of organism or cell under consideration. herein, high-throughput screening (hts) was used to elucidate zno nanoparticle stability, bioavailability, and antibacterial mechanisms as a function of iron doping level (in the zno nanoparticles), aquatic chemistry, and bacterial cell type. zeta-potential and aggregation state of dispersed zno nanoparticles was strongly influenced by iron doping in addition to electrolyte composition and dissolved organic matter; however, bacterial inactivation by zno nanoparticles was most significantly influenced by zn(2+) ions dissolution, cell type, and organic matter. nanoparticle ic(50) values determined for bacillus subtilis and escherichia coli were on the order of 0.3-0.5 and 15-43 mg/l (as zn(2+)), while the ic(50) for zn(2+) tolerant pseudomonas putida was always >500 mg/l. tannic acid decreased toxicity of zno nanoparticles more than humic, fulvic, and alginic acid, because it complexed the most free zn(2+) ions, thereby reducing their bioavailability. these results underscore the complexities and challenges regulators face in assessing potential environmental impacts of nanotechnology; however, the high-throughput and combinatorial methods employed promise to rapidly expand the knowledge base needed to develop an appropriate risk assessment framework.
scale-up of baeyer-villiger monooxygenase-catalyzed synthesis of enantiopure compounds.
several baeyer-villiger monooxygenases converting a wide spectrum of substrates have been discovered, cloned, and characterized throughout the last few years. still, only a few of them are applicable for large-scale conversion predominantly due to their sensitivity towards high substrate and/or product concentrations. the recently cloned and characterized 4-hydroxyacetophenone monooxygenase from pseudomonas putida jd1 shows excellent enantioselectivity towards 3-phenyl-2-butanone with e > 100 but is inhibited by concentrations >10 mm of both substrate and product. this obstacle could be circumvented by in situ substrate feed and product removal using a hydrophobic lewatit(r) adsorbent resin. thus, the concentration of 3-phenyl-2-butanone could be increased from 1.4 to >26 mm without significant reduction in conversion.
antimicrobial effect of silver-impregnated cellulose: potential for antimicrobial therapy.
background: silver has long been known to have antimicrobial activity. to incorporate this property into multiple applications, a silver-impregnated cellulose (sic) with low cytotoxicity to human cells was developed. sic differs from other silver treatment methods in that the leaching of silver particles is non-existent and the release of ionic silver is highly controlled. results: candida albicans, micrococcus luteu, pseudomonas putida, and escherichia coli were used for antimicrobial testing. no microbial cells were able to grow in the presence of sic at concentrations above 0.0035 ag w/v %. even at a concentration of 0.00035 ag w/v %, p. putida and m. luteu failed to grow, and c. albicans and e. coli exhibited diminished growth. to determine the cytotoxic effect of silver on human cells, five different concentrations of sic were tested on human fibroblasts. in sic concentrations of 0.035 ag w/v % and below, no cytotoxicity was observed. conclusion: the optimal concentration of sic for a broad range of anti-microbial activity and low or negligible cytotoxicity was 0.0035 ag w/v %. although the highly controlled releasing characteristics of sic would prove a substantial improvement over current technologies, further investigation for genotoxicity and other biocompatibility test will be required.
effect of cell-surface hydrophobicity on bacterial conversion of water-immiscible chemicals in two-liquid-phase culture systems.
the effect of bacterial cell-surface hydrophobicity on the bioconversion of water-immiscible chemicals in an aqueous-organic (a/o) two-liquid-phase culture system was investigated. escherichia coli jm109 and rhodococcus opacus b-4 were used as hydrophilic and hydrophobic whole-cell catalysts, respectively. hydroxylation reactions of monoaromatics, including toluene (log p(ow)=2.9), ethylbenzene (3.1), n-propylbenzene (3.4), and sec-butylbenzene (3.7), were employed as model conversions. when the todc1c2ba genes encoding pseudomonas putida toluene dioxygenase were expressed in e. coli jm109, the yield of hydroxylated monoaromatics decreased with increasing substrate hydrophobicity. by contrast, r. opacus transformants, which expressed the todc1c2ba genes, showed high performance in the hydroxylation of monoaromatics, irrespective of substrate hydrophobicity. when the r. opacus transformants were examined for their ability to hydroxylate monoaromatics in an aqueous single-liquid-phase culture, the reaction velocity was markedly lower than that observed in the a/o two-liquid-phase culture. these results suggested that r. opacus b-4 accessed the hydrophobic substrates in the oil phase, thus making it more effective for the bioconversion reactions.
solubility enhancement of aggregation-prone heterologous proteins by fusion expression using stress-responsive escherichia coli protein, rpos.
background: the most efficient method for enhancing solubility of recombinant proteins appears to use the fusion expression partners. although commercial fusion partners including maltose binding protein and glutathione-s-transferase have shown good performance in enhancing the solubility, they cannot be used for the proprietory production of commercially value-added proteins and likely cannot serve as universal helpers to solve all protein solubility and folding issues. thus, novel fusion partners will continue to be developed through systematic investigations including proteome mining presented in this study. results: we analyzed the escherichia coli proteome response to the exogenous stress of guanidine hydrochloride using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and found that rpos (rna polymerase sigma factor) was significantly stress responsive. while under the stress condition the total number of soluble proteins decreased by about 7 %, but a 6-fold increase in the level of rpos was observed, indicating that rpos is a stress-induced protein. as an n-terminus fusion expression partner, rpos increased significantly the solubility of many aggregation-prone heterologous proteins in e. coli cytoplasm, indicating that rpos is a very effective solubility enhancer for the synthesis of many recombinant proteins. rpos was also well suited for the production of a biologically active fusion mutant of pseudomonas putida cutinase. conclusion: rpos is highly effective as a strong solubility enhancer for aggregation-prone heterologous proteins when it is used as a fusion expression partner in an e. coli expression system. the results of these findings may, therefore, be useful in the production of other biologically active industrial enzymes, as successfully demonstrated by cutinase.
[changes in electrophysical characteristics of azospirillum brasilense sp7 cells  during their interaction with polyclonal antibodies].
electrooptical characteristics of azospirillum brasilense sp7 cells during their  specific interaction with polyclonal rabbit antibodies were studied. dependence of optical density of cell suspension during electroorientation of cells from frequency of orienting field in interval 10, 100, 250, and 500 khz was evaluated. itwas shown that electrooptical (eo) characteristics of bacterial suspensions change during interaction of a. brasilense cells with antibodies, and maximal changes occur when frequency of oriented field amounts 100-250 khz. during interaction of a. brasilense sp7 with strain-specific polyclonal antibodies in the presence of escherichia coli k-12 and pseudomonas putida c-11 decrease of amplitude of analytic signal was observed but detection of a. brasilense sp7 cells was possible. possibility of detection of microorganisms by eo analysis during their interaction with antibodies was shown.
escherichia coli malate dehydrogenase, a novel solubility enhancer for heterologous proteins synthesized in escherichia coli.
using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the escherichia coli proteome response to a heat-shock stress was analyzed and a 1.6-fold increase of malate dehydrogenase was observed even under the heat-shock condition where the total number of soluble proteins decreased by about 5%. we subsequently demonstrated that, as an n-terminus fusion expression partner, malate dehydrogenase facilitated the folding of, and dramatically increased the solubility of, many aggregation-prone heterologous proteins in e. coli cytoplasm. therefore, malate dehydrogenase is well suited for production of a biologically active fusion mutant of cutinase (pseudomonas putida origin) that is currently of considerable to biotechnology and commercial industries.
analysis of novel soluble chromate and uranyl reductases and generation of an improved enzyme by directed evolution.
most polluted sites contain mixed waste. this is especially true of the u.s. department of energy (doe) waste sites which hold a complex mixture of heavy metals, radionuclides, and organic solvents. in such environments enzymes that can remediate multiple pollutants are advantageous. we report here evolution of an enzyme, chrr6 (formerly referred to as y6), which shows a markedly enhanced capacity for remediating two of the most serious and prevalent doe contaminants, chromate and uranyl. chrr6 is a soluble enzyme and reduces chromate and uranyl intracellularly. thus, the reduced product is at least partially sequestered and nucleated, minimizing the chances of reoxidation. only one amino acid change, (tyr)128(asn), was responsible for the observed improvement. we show here that chrr6 makes pseudomonas putida and escherichia coli more efficient agents for bioremediation if the cellular permeability barrier to the metals is decreased.
proteins with ggdef and eal domains regulate pseudomonas putida biofilm formation and dispersal.
microbial biofilm formation often causes problems in medical and industrial settings, and knowledge about the factors that are involved in biofilm development and dispersion is useful for creating strategies to control the processes. in this report, we present evidence that proteins with ggdef and eal domains are involved in the regulation of biofilm formation and biofilm dispersion in pseudomonas putida. overexpression in p. putida of the escherichia coli yedq protein, which contains a ggdef domain, resulted in increased biofilm formation. overexpression in p. putida of the e. coli yhjh protein, which contains an eal domain, strongly inhibited biofilm formation. induction of yhjh expression in p. putida cells situated in established biofilms led to rapid dispersion of the biofilms. these results support the emerging theme that ggdef-domain and eal-domain proteins are involved in regulating the transition of bacteria between a roaming lifestyle and a sessile biofilm lifestyle.
expression, crystallization and preliminary diffraction studies of the pseudomonas putida cytochrome p450cam operon repressor camr.
the pseudomonas putida cam repressor (camr) is a homodimeric protein that binds to the camo dna operator to inhibit the transcription of the cytochrome p450cam operon camdcab. camr has two functional domains: a regulatory domain and a dna-binding domain. the binding of the inducer d-camphor to the regulatory domain renders the dna-binding domain unable to bind camo. native camr and its selenomethionyl derivative have been overproduced in escherichia coli and purified. native camr was crystallized under the following conditions: (i) 12-14% peg 4000, 50 mm na pipes, 0.1 m kcl, 1% glycerol ph 7.3 at 288 k with and without camphor and (ii) 1.6 m p(i), 50 mm na pipes, 2 mm camphor ph 6.7 at 278 k. the selenomethionyl derivative camr did not crystallize under either of these conditions, but did crystallize using 12.5% peg mme 550, 25 mm na pipes, 2.5 mm mgcl2 ph 7.3 at 298 k. preliminary x-ray diffraction studies revealed the space group to be orthorhombic (p2(1)2(1)2), with unit-cell parameters a = 48.0, b = 73.3, c = 105.7 a. native and selenomethionyl derivative data sets were collected to 3 a resolution at spring-8 and the photon factory.
influence of growth phase on bacterial cell electrokinetic characteristics examined by soft particle electrophoresis theory.
the influence of incubation time on the electrokinetic properties of escherichia  coli, pseudomonas putida, alcaligenes faecalis, and alcaligenes sp., was examined by electrophoretic mobility measurements and the results were discussed based on ohshima's soft particle theory. the electrophoretic mobility of e. coli plotted against incubation time revealed that the mobility gradually increased from the outset of incubation to 7 h, which corresponded to the exponential growth and early stationary phase, and then decreased. for all strains, electrophoretic mobility leveled off to nonzero values in accordance with the increase in ionic concentration, which was a characteristic feature of soft particles. soft particle analysis was carried out at the outset of incubation and the time when mobility reached a maximum in order to obtain the spatial charge density (zn) and cell surface softness (1/lambda). zn at the maximum electrophoretic mobility was more negative than that at the outset of incubation for e. coli, p. putida, and a. faecalis, while the zn of alcaligenes sp. almost remained unchanged. 1/lambda decreased for e. coli, but increased for alcaligenes sp. and a. faecalis. these findings indicated that the cell growth phase affects both zn and 1/lambda, although the dependencies of these parameters are unique to each bacterial strain.
antibacterial effect of bulbophyllum neilgherrense wt. (orchidaceae). an in vitro study.
the antibacterial activity of bulbophyllum neilgherrense was tested against five  species of bacteria, viz., escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus pumilus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas putida aqueous, ethanolic and chloroform soluble extracts of leaf and pseudobulb (5.50 w/v) were screened for their antibacterial potential. the zone of inhibition was seen to be largest when alcoholic extract was used.
stress-related pseudomonas genes involved in production of bacteriocin llpa.
pseudomonas sp. bw11m1 produces a novel type of bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of pseudomonas putida gr12-2r3 and some phytopathogenic fluorescent pseudomonas. a collection of mutants was screened for altered bacteriocin production phenotypes. strongly reduced bacteriocin production was found to be caused by inactivation of the reca gene or the spot gene. conversely, in a recj mutant, the bacteriocin was constitutively overproduced. the same phenotype was observed for a mutant hit in a gene of unknown function. the predicted gene product belongs to a distinct subgroup of prokaryotic helicase-like proteins within the swi/snf family of regulatory proteins. one mutant that also exhibited a bacteriocin overproducer phenotype was deficient in the production of the peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein oprl. this study shows that various environmental stress response pathways are involved in controlling expression of the pseudomonas sp. bw11m1 bacteriocin.
biocatalytic synthesis of polycatechols from toxic aromatic compounds.
a process is described in which toxic aromatic compounds are converted by toluene dioxygenase and in turn toluene cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase to catechols which are further polymerized by peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation producing polycatechols. three approaches for obtaining catechols were employed: (1) addition of halogenated aromatics to p. putida f1, resulting in the accumulation of halogenated catechols; (2) inhibition of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase of p. putida f1 by known aromatic and aliphatic inhibitors; and (3) overexpression of toluene dioxygenase and toluene cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase genes in e. coli jm109. the process is suitable for producing novel catechols that upon oxidation may yield polymers with unique properties, presenting a tool for producing tailor-made biopolymers. formation of 3-chlorocatechol from chlorobenzene, 3,4-dichlorocatechol from 1,2-dichlorobenzene, and catechol from benzene and their subsequent oxidation and polymerization was demonstrated. oxidation of catechol yielded polymers with molecular weights of up to 4000 daltons. their apparently high water solubility eliminates the need for water-miscible solvents. in aqueous solution oxidation of catechols was rapid, yet the presence of 20%, 30%, and 40% ethanol, resulted in a rate decrease of 31%, 95%, and 93%, respectively. the advantage is that significantly less peroxidase is required for performing the reactions if miscible solvents are not employed. furthermore, water-soluble polymers may be desirable for many applications.
[derivation of the tn5-induced mutants of the plasmid-containing naphthalene- and salicylate-degrading strains of pseudomonas putida bs394(pbs216) and the inhibition of their growth on different substrates by low temperatures].

antimicrobial potential of immobilized lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis atcc 11454 against selected bacteria.
immobilization of living cells of lactic acid bacteria could be an alternative or complementary method of immobilizing organic acids and bacteriocins and inhibit undesirable bacteria in foods. this study evaluated the inhibition potential of immobilized lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis atcc 11454 on selected bacteria by a modified method of the agar spot test. l. lactis was immobilized in calcium alginate (1 to 2%)-whey protein concentrate (0 and 1%) beads. the antimicrobial potential of immobilized l. lactis was evaluated in microbiological media against pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, salmonella, and staphylococcus aureus) or pseudomonas putida, a natural meat contaminant, and against seven gram-positive bacteria used as indicator strains. results obtained in this study indicated that immobilized l. lactis inhibited the growth of s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus sakei, kocuria varians, and pediococcus acidilactici. only 4 h of incubation at 35 degrees c resulted in a clear inhibition zone around the beads that increased with time. with the addition of 10 mm of a chelating agent (edta) to the media, results showed growth inhibition of e. coli; however, p. putida and salmonella typhi were unaffected by this treatment. these results indicate that immobilized lactic acid bacteria strains can be successfully used to produce nisin and inhibit bacterial growth in semisolid synthetic media.
genetically modified bacterial strains and novel bacterial artificial chromosome  shuttle vectors for constructing environmental libraries and detecting heterologous natural products in multiple expression hosts.
the enormous diversity of uncultured microorganisms in soil and other environments provides a potentially rich source of novel natural products, which is critically important for drug discovery efforts. our investigators reported previously on the creation and screening of an escherichia coli library containing soil dna cloned and expressed in a bacterial artificial chromosome (bac) vector. in that initial study, our group identified novel enzyme activities and a family of antibacterial small molecules encoded by soil dna cloned and expressed in e. coli. to continue our pilot study of the utility and feasibility of this approach to natural product drug discovery, we have expanded our technology to include streptomyces lividans and pseudomonas putida as additional hosts with different expression capabilities, and herein we describe the tools we developed for transferring environmental libraries into all three expression hosts and screening for novel activities. these tools include derivatives of s. lividans that contain complete and unmarked deletions of the act and red endogenous pigment gene clusters, a derivative of p. putida that can accept environmental dna vectors and integrate the heterologous dna into the chromosome, and new bac shuttle vectors for transferring large fragments of environmental dna from e. coli to both s. lividans and p. putida by high-throughput conjugation. finally, we used these tools to confirm that the three hosts have different expression capabilities for some known gene clusters.
recombinant escherichia coli for the biomonitoring of benzene and its derivatives in the air.
for protection against environmental deterioration, pollutants should be reduced  as much as possible. therefore, a sensitive detection method for air pollutants is required, particularly for benzene, a compound with mutagenic, teratogenic, and carcinogenic properties. some microorganisms have a number of enzymes that degrade organic compounds. the genetic information for many of these enzymes is codified in plasmids that usually comprise some elements such as proteins and rna for their replication, and proteins for cell division control. some plasmids have been obtained from pseudomonas putida, a ubiquitous microorganism that is able to degrade biologic and inorganic compounds. p. putida contains the tol plasmid, responsible for the degradation of benzene and its derivatives. the tol plasmid has been fused with the gene for firefly luciferase (ptns316 plasmid) to produce a luminescent bacterium (escherichia coli hb101), which can be applied to the environmental monitoring of these chemicals. the recombinant e. coli transformed with the plasmid (e. coli hb101-ptns316) was applied to the environmental biosensing of benzene and its derivatives. measurement of bacteria-generated photons was done using a color-coded device to estimate quantitatively the pollutant concentration. the expression of luciferase was induced in the presence of aromatic compounds but the e. coli sensitivity has a detection limit: this bacterium dies if the benzene concentration is higher than 0.5 ppm and at this concentration the luminescence decreases so it is impossible to detect. another limit for this biodevice is that the microorganism, very likely, accumulates the benzene and its derivatives, and therefore it is very important to consider the time of exposure. this biomonitor potentially offers a rapid, inexpensive, and sensitive technique for environmental detection of aromatic pollutant compounds.
synthesis and activity of 5'-uridinyl dipeptide analogues mimicking the amino terminal peptide chain of nucleoside antibiotic mureidomycin a.
a series of 5'-uridinyl dipeptides were synthesised which mimic the amino terminal chain of nucleoside antibiotic mureido omycin a. aminoacyl-beta-alanyl- and aminoacyl-n-methyl-beta-alanyl- dipeptides were attached either via an ester linkage to the 5'-hydroxyl of uridine, or via an amide linkage to 5'-amino-5'-deoxyuridine. the most active inhibitor of escherichia coli phospho-murnac-pentapeptide translocase (mray) was 5'-o-(l-ala-n-methyl-beta-alanyl)-uridine (13l), which also showed 97% enzyme inhibition at 2.35 mm concentration, and showed antibacterial activity at 100 microg/ml concentration against pseudomonas putida. both the central n-methyl amide linkage and a 5' uridine ester linkage were required for highest biological activity. enzyme inhibition was shown to be competitive with mg(2+). it is proposed that the primary amino terminus of the inhibitor binds in place of the mg(2+) cofactor at the mray active site, positioned via a cis-n-methyl amide linkage.
secondary metabolites of flustra foliacea and their influence on bacteria.
the north sea bryozoan flustra foliacea was investigated to determine its secondary metabolite content. gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of a dichloromethane extract of the bryozoan enabled 11 compounds to be identified. preparative high-performance liquid chromatography of the extract resulted in the isolation of 10 brominated alkaloids (compounds 1 to 10) and one diterpene (compound 11). all of these compounds were tested to determine their activities in agar diffusion assays against bacteria derived from marine and terrestrial environments. compounds 1, 3 to 7, 10, and 11 exhibited significant activities against one or more marine bacterial strains originally isolated from f. foliacea but only weak activities against all of the terrestrial bacteria. by using the biosensors pseudomonas putida(pkr-c12), p. putida(pas-c8), and escherichia coli(psb403) the antagonistic effect on n-acyl-homoserine lactone-dependent quorum-sensing systems was investigated. compounds 8 and 10 caused reductions in the signal intensities in these bioassays ranging from 50 to 20% at a concentration of 20 micro g/ml.
long-term reduction of cold hardiness following ingestion of ice-nucleating bacteria in the colorado potato beetle, leptinotarsa decemlineata.
we investigated the effect of ingestion of ice-nucleating bacteria on the supercooling capacity and cold hardiness of the colorado potato beetle (leptinotarsa decemlineata say), a freeze-intolerant species that overwinters as adults in shallow, terrestrial burrows. ingestion of ice-nucleating bacteria (enterobacter agglomerans, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas syringae), fed on slices of potato tuber, caused an abrupt decrease in supercooling capacity. no change occurred in the supercooling capacity of beetles fed escherichia coli, as this species lacks ice-nucleating activity. ingestion rates showed that tubers treated with different species were equally palatable. during diapause induction beetles evacuated food from their guts, but nevertheless retained sufficient ice-nucleating bacteria to diminish supercooling. beetles fed p. fluorescens and p. putida exhibited reduced supercooling even after an 8-wk exposure to simulated winter conditions. furthermore, p. fluorescens was isolated 10-wk post-ingestion from diapausing beetles. our data suggest that ingested bacteria may be retained by insects during entry into diapause and that the cold hardiness of candidate crop pests, such as l. decemlineata, may be reduced by feeding them ice-nucleating bacteria prior to winter diapause.
imp-12, a new plasmid-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase from a pseudomonas putida clinical isolate.
a pseudomonas putida strain showing broad-spectrum resistance to beta-lactams, including expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenems, was isolated from a patient with a urinary tract infection at the university hospital of varese in northern italy. the isolate was found to produce metallo-beta-lactamase activity and to harbor a 50-kb plasmid, named pva758, carrying a new bla(imp) determinant, named bla(imp-12). plasmid pva758 was not self-transferable by conjugation to either escherichia coli or pseudomonas aeruginosa but could be introduced by electroporation and maintained in the latter host, where it conferred resistance or decreased susceptibility to various beta-lactams. the imp-12 enzyme is quite divergent from other imp variants: its closest relatives are imp-8 and imp-2 (89 and 88% sequence identity, respectively), and imp-1 is 85% identical to imp-12. the bla(imp-12) determinant is carried on an integron-borne gene cassette whose attc recombination site is related to those present in cassettes containing bla(imp-1), bla(imp-6), bla(imp-7), bla(imp-10), and bla(imp-11) and unrelated to that present in cassettes containing bla(imp-2) and bla(imp-8). imp-12 was overproduced in e. coli by using a t7-based expression system and was purified by cation-exchange chromatography followed by gel filtration. kinetic analysis revealed that, like other imp variants, imp-12 exhibits an overall preference for cephalosporins and carbapenems rather than for penicillins and does not hydrolyze temocillin and aztreonam. however, imp-12 also exhibits some notable functional differences from other imp variants, including uniformly poor activity toward penicillins (k(cat)/k(m) values, around 10(4) m(-1). s(-1)) and a remarkably high k(m) (around 900 micro m) for imipenem.
a constructed microbial consortium for biodegradation of the organophosphorus insecticide parathion.
a consortium comprised of two engineered microorganisms was assembled for biodegradation of the organophosphate insecticide parathion. escherichia coli sd2 harbored two plasmids, one encoding a gene for parathion hydrolase and a second carrying a green fluorescent protein marker. pseudomonas putida kt2440 psb337 contained a p-nitrophenol-inducible plasmid-borne operon encoding the genes for p-nitrophenol mineralization. the co-culture effectively hydrolyzed 500 microm parathion (146 mg l(-1)) and prevented the accumulation of p-nitrophenol in suspended culture. kinetic analyses were conducted to characterize the growth and substrate utilization of the consortium members. parathion hydrolysis by e. coli sd2 followed michaelis-menten kinetics. p-nitrophenol mineralization by p. putida kt2440 psb337 exhibited substrate-inhibition kinetics. the growth of both strains was inhibited by increasing concentrations of p-nitrophenol, with e. coli sd2 completely inhibited by 600 microm p-nitrophenol (83 mg l(-1)) and p. putida kt2440 psb337 inhibited by 1,000 microm p-nitrophenol (139 mg l(-1)). cultivation of the consortium as a biofilm indicated that the two species could cohabit as a population of attached cells. analysis by confocal microscopy showed that the biofilm was predominantly comprised of p. putida kt2440 psb337 and that the distribution of e. coli sd2 within the biofilm was heterogeneous. the use of biofilms for the construction of degradative consortia may prove beneficial.
microbial toxicity tests and chemical analysis as monitoring parameters at composting of creosote-contaminated soil.
traditionally, chemical analyses are used in the assessment of contaminated soil  and in monitoring the efficiency of soil remediation processes. we investigated if chemical analysis could be supported and even partly replaced by biological toxicity tests. in two case studies creosote-contaminated soil was composted outdoors in 5- and 100-m3 windrows. degradation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) was followed by chemical analysis and toxicity tests. polyaromatic hydrocarbons were quantified and identified by hplc. because the soil was also contaminated by copper-, chromium-, and arsenic-containing fungicides, these elements were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry. the toxicity of soil samples was assessed by a soil-contact modification of the luminescent bacteria (vibrio fischeri) test and in the other case also by enzyme synthesis inhibition (toxi-chromopad test, escherichia coli). the toxicity of soil water extracts was measured by the standard luminescent bacteria (v. fischeri) test and bacterial (pseudomonas putida) growth inhibition test. after the first 4 months of the composting period the total amount of pahs was reduced in all windrows, and in particular, the loss of two- and some three-ring compounds was high, almost 90%. toxicity decreased concurrently with the decrease in pah concentration during composting, but after 4 months, one of the piles inoculated with mycobacteria and containing more three- and four-ring compounds was found to be more toxic than at the beginning. after the next summer, total pah content was further reduced but some four-ring or heavier compounds were demonstrated to be poorly degraded. the toxicity was also reduced to the same level as in the control pile. the total pah content and the toxicity were both reduced significantly during 5 months of composting.
plant lectin-like bacteriocin from a rhizosphere-colonizing pseudomonas isolate.
rhizosphere isolate pseudomonas sp. strain bw11m1, which belongs to the pseudomonas putida cluster, secretes a heat- and protease-sensitive bacteriocin which kills p. putida gr12-2r3. the production of this bacteriocin is enhanced by dna-damaging treatment of producer cells. we isolated a tnmod mutant of strain bw11m1 that had lost the capacity to inhibit the growth of strain gr12-2r3. a wild-type genomic fragment encompassing the transposon insertion site was shown to confer the bacteriocin phenotype when it was introduced into escherichia coli cells. the bacteriocin structural gene was identified by defining the minimal region required for expression in e. coli. this gene was designated llpa (lectin-like putidacin) on the basis of significant homology of its 276-amino-acid product with mannose-binding lectins from monocotyledonous plants. llpa is composed of two monocot mannose-binding lectin (mmbl) domains. several uncharacterized bacterial genes encoding diverse proteins containing one or two mmbl domains were identified. a phylogenetic analysis of the mmbl domains present in eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins assigned the putidacin domains to a new bacterial clade within the mmbl-containing protein family. heterologous expression of the llpa gene also conveyed bacteriocin production to several pseudomonas fluorescens strains. in addition, we demonstrated that strain bw11m1 and heterologous hosts secrete llpa into the growth medium without requiring a cleavable signal sequence. most likely, the mode of action of this lectin-like bacteriocin is different from the modes of action of previously described pseudomonas bacteriocins.
characterization of wastewater toxicity by means of a whole-cell bacterial biosensor, using pseudomonas putida, in conjunction with chemical analysis.
a new amperometric biosensor based on inhibition of pseudomonas putida has been developed to assess the acute toxicity of wastewater. this system uses the biological component immobilized on disposable screen-printed electrodes. the responses for a selected group of polar organic standard substances were studied using pseudomonas putida as biological component. the results have been compared with responses obtained using the same system and escherichia coli as biological component and with the bioluminescence inhibition of vibrio fisheri using toxalert 100. different properties, e.g. the standard deviation (sd) of the data, the goodness of fit (r2) and the standard deviation (syx) of the vertical distances of the points from the inhibition curve, the 50% effective concentration (ec50) and the toxicity units (tii50) of the standard substance, were calculated and compared. this biosensor was used to assess the acute toxicity of real wastewater samples collected at different wastewater treatment plants (wwtp). finally, a sequential solid-phase extraction (sspe) procedure followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (lc-ms) was used to determine the polar organic toxic substances present in the wastewater samples.
the tol plasmid pww0 xyln gene product from pseudomonas putida is involved in m-xylene uptake.
the upper operon of the tol plasmid pww0 of pseudomonas putida encodes a set of enzymes involved in the conversion of toluene and xylenes to their carboxylic acid derivatives. the last gene of the upper operon, xyln, encodes a 465-amino-acid polypeptide which exhibits significant sequence similarity to fadl, an outer membrane protein involved in fatty acid transport in escherichia coli. to analyze the role of the xyln gene product, xyln on tol plasmid pww0 was disrupted by inserting a kanamycin resistance gene, and the phenotypes of p. putida harboring the wild-type and xyln mutant tol plasmids were characterized. the growth of p. putida harboring the wild-type tol plasmid was inhibited by a high concentration of m-xylene, while that of p. putida harboring the xyln mutant tol plasmid was not. the apparent k(s) value for the oxidation of m-xylene in intact cells of the xyln mutant was fourfold higher than that of the wild-type strain, although the tol catabolic enzyme activities in cell extracts from the two strains were almost identical. we therefore presume that the xyln gene product is a porin involved in the transport of m-xylene and its analogues across the outer membrane. western blot analysis confirmed the localization of xyln in the outer membrane.
comparison of response of six different luminescent bacterial bioassays to bioremediation of five contrasting oils.
the performance of six different bioluminescent bacteria for the assessment of oil bioremediation was compared. three contained lux genes linked to promoters from hydrocarbon degradation pathways: pseudomonas fluorescens hk44 (putk21), escherichia coli hms174 (pos25) and e. coli dh5 alpha (pgec74, pjama7), responding to naphthalene, isopropylbenzene and octane, respectively. the other three expressed lux constitutively: e. coli hb101 (pucd607) and p. putida f1 (pucd607) are genetically engineered, while vibrio fischeri is naturally bioluminescent and was included to facilitate comparison with previous work. five different oils (four crude oils plus diesel) were spiked into soil, and the progress of remediation was followed over a period of 119 d by monitoring both hydrocarbon disappearance and changes in the microbial response to soil extracts. the octane bioassay was the only one of the hydrocarbon-responsive bacterial assays to show any appreciable response, with up to 20-fold induction by light crude oils. heavy crude oil and diesel elicited a much weaker response. the metabolic (lux constitutively expressed) bioassays showed that there was a general increase in toxicity over the course of the experiment, although toxicity to e. coli hb101 (pucd607) appeared to be decreasing by the final sampling point. the metabolic bioassay response was much less variable between the different oils than for the first three, catabolic, strains.
accumulation of methylglyoxal in anaerobically grown escherichia coli and its detoxification by expression of the pseudomonas putida glyoxalase i gene.
anaerobic glycerol fermentation by escherichia coli strains expressing genes from the klebsiella pneumoniae dha regulon showed that cell growth and 1,3-propanediol (1,3-pd) production are significantly inhibited when 5 g/l or higher of glycerol is initially present. one reason for this inhibition may be methylglyoxal (mg) accumulation. assays of both intracellular and extracellular mg levels indicated an accumulation of mg in anaerobic glycerol fermentation of transgenic e. coli. pseudomonas putida glyoxalase i was expressed in the transgenic e. coli to enhance mg detoxification. the activity of glyoxalase i in the transgenic e. coli with the p. putida glyoxalase i under anaerobic conditions was 12-fold higher than that in the control cells. compared to the control cells, the transgenic cells with the p. putida glyoxalase i displayed a reduction of 35-43% in intracellular mg and a decrease of 30% in extracellular mg. these decreases were statistically significant (p>94). furthermore, the expression of the p. putida glyoxalase i in the transgenic e. coli markedly improved cell growth and resulted in a 50% increase in 1,3-pd production.
role of fatty acid de novo biosynthesis in polyhydroxyalkanoic acid (pha) and rhamnolipid synthesis by pseudomonads: establishment of the transacylase (phag)-mediated pathway for pha biosynthesis in escherichia coli.
since pseudomonas aeruginosa is capable of biosynthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoic acid (pha) and rhamnolipids, which contain lipid moieties that are derived from fatty acid biosynthesis, we investigated various fab mutants from p. aeruginosa with respect to biosynthesis of phas and rhamnolipids. all isogenic faba, fabb, fabi, rhlg, and phag mutants from p. aeruginosa showed decreased pha accumulation and rhamnolipid production. in the phag (encoding transacylase) mutant rhamnolipid production was only slightly decreased. expression of phag from pseudomonas putida and expression of the beta-ketoacyl reductase gene rhlg from p. aeruginosa in these mutants indicated that phag catalyzes diversion of intermediates of fatty acid de novo biosynthesis towards pha biosynthesis, whereas rhlg catalyzes diversion towards rhamnolipid biosynthesis. these data suggested that both biosynthesis pathways are competitive. in order to investigate whether phag is the only linking enzyme between fatty acid de novo biosynthesis and pha biosynthesis, we generated five tn5 mutants of p. putida strongly impaired in pha production from gluconate. all mutants were complemented by the phag gene from p. putida, indicating that the transacylase-mediated pha biosynthesis route represents the only metabolic link between fatty acid de novo biosynthesis and pha biosynthesis in this bacterium. the transacylase-mediated pha biosynthesis route from gluconate was established in recombinant e. coli, coexpressing the class ii pha synthase gene phac1 together with the phag gene from p. putida, only when fatty acid de novo biosynthesis was partially inhibited by triclosan. the accumulated pha contributed to 2 to 3% of cellular dry weight.
regulation of rpos gene expression in pseudomonas: involvement of a tetr family regulator.
the rpos gene encodes the sigma factor which was identified in several gram-negative bacteria as a central regulator during stationary phase. rpos gene regulation is known to respond to cell density, showing higher expression in stationary phase. for pseudomonas aeruginosa, it has been demonstrated that the cell-density-dependent regulation response known as quorum sensing interacts with this regulatory response. using the rpos promoter of p. putida, we identified a genomic tn5 insertion mutant of p. putida which showed a 90% decrease in rpos promoter activity, resulting in less rpos being present in a cell at stationary phase. molecular analysis revealed that this mutant carried a tn5 insertion in a gene, designated psra (pseudomonas sigma regulator), which codes for a protein (psra) of 26.3 kda. psra contains a helix-turn-helix motif typical of dna binding proteins and belongs to the tetr family of bacterial regulators. the homolog of the psra gene was identified in p. aeruginosa; the protein showed 90% identity to psra of p. putida. a psra::tn5 insertion mutant of p. aeruginosa was constructed. in both pseudomonas species, psra was genetically linked to the sos lexa repressor gene. similar to what was observed for p. putida, a psra null mutant of p. aeruginosa also showed a 90% reduction in rpos promoter activity; both mutants could be complemented for rpos promoter activity when the psra gene was provided in trans. psra mutants of both pseudomonas species lost the ability to induce rpos expression at stationary phase, but they retained the ability to produce quorum-sensing autoinducer molecules. psra was demonstrated to negatively regulate psra gene expression in pseudomonas and in escherichia coli as well as to be capable of activating the rpos promoter in e. coli. our data suggest that psra is an important regulatory protein of pseudomonas spp. involved in the regulatory cascade controlling rpos gene regulation in response to cell density.
cell envelope mutants of pseudomonas putida: physiological characterization and analysis of their ability to survive in soil.
to generate mutants with altered lipopolysaccharides (lps) of the wild-type pseudomonas putida kt2442, we used the mini-tn5luxab-km transposon. a mutant was found among luminescent colonies and selected as a negative clone in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) with monoclonal antibody (mab) 7.3b, which recognizes the o-antigen of p. putida lps. the dna region of the lps mutant interrupted by the minitransposon insertion was cloned and sequenced. comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with protein sequence databases showed similarity to the o-antigen polymerase (wzy) of salmonella enterica (muenchen). the wild-type gene was rescued by polymerase chain reaction (pcr), cloned into a broad-host-range plasmid and used to carry out complementation assays. the cloned gene was able to restore the wild-type phenotype of the p. putida wzy mutant. we constructed an isogenic mutant of the luminescent wzy mutant to which an oprl mutation was transferred by homologous recombination with an oprl::xyle cassette. the wzy mutants of p. putida were more sensitive to sds, deoxycholate and edta than the corresponding parental strains. we analysed the ability of wzy, oprl and wzy oprl mutants of p. putida to colonize soil. in comparison with the wild-type strain, the ability of single mutants to colonize soil decreased; this characteristic was more evident for the double mutant, especially at high temperatures.
a battery of toxicity tests as indicators of decontamination in composting oily waste.
heterogeneous oily waste from an old dumping site was composted in three windrows constructed from different proportions of waste, sewage sludge, and bark. the objectives of this pilot study were to examine the usefulness of composting as a treatment method for this particular waste and to study decontamination in the composting process by using a battery of toxicity tests. five samples from the windrow having intermediate oil concentrations were tested with toxicity tests based on microbes (pseudomonas putida growth inhibition test, toxichromotest, metplate, and three different modifications of a luminescent bacterial test), enzyme inhibition (reverse electron transport), plants (duckweed growth inhibition and red clover seed germination), and soil animals (folsomia candida, enchytraeus albidus, and enchytraeus sp.). the luminescent bacterial tests were used as prescreening tests. chemical analyses of samples were carried out simultaneously. both toxicity and oil concentration, including those of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (pahs), were reduced during composting and soil quality improved significantly. the total oil hydrocarbon concentration decreased from 90,000 to 19,000 mg/kg, measured with the ir method, in 4 months, and from 86,000 to 1400 mg/kg, measured with gc method. the concentration of pahs decreased from 135 to 23.5 mg/kg. during the fourth month of composting (stabilization stage), the proportion of the heaviest oil fractions (asphaltenes) became dominant. toxicity varied between different samples and between different bioassays; however, the first sample was significantly more toxic than the others, and most of the tests revealed a decrease in toxicity during the composting process.
trfa-dependent inner membrane-associated plasmid rk2 dna synthesis and association of trfa with membranes of different gram-negative hosts.
trfa, the replication initiator protein of broad-host-range plasmid rk2, was tested for its ability to bind to the membrane of four different gram-negative hosts in addition to escherichia coli: pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and rhodobacter sphaeroides. cells harboring trfa-encoding plasmids were fractionated into soluble, inner membrane, and outer membrane fractions. the fractions were subjected to western blotting, and the blots were probed with antibody to the trfa proteins. trfa was found to fractionate with the cell membranes of all species tested. when the two membrane fractions of these species were tested for their ability to synthesize plasmid dna endogenously (i.e., without added template or enzymes), only the inner membrane fraction was capable of extensive synthesis that was inhibited by anti-trfa antibody in a manner similar to that of the original host species, e. coli. in addition, although dna synthesis did occur in the outer membrane fraction, it was much less extensive than that exhibited by the inner membrane fraction and only slightly affected by anti-trfa antibody. plasmid dna synthesized by the inner membrane fraction of one representative species, p. aeruginosa, was characteristic of supercoil and intermediate forms of the plasmid. extensive dna synthesis was observed in the soluble fraction of another representative species, r. sphaeroides, but it was completely unaffected by anti-trfa antibody, suggesting that such synthesis was due to repair and/or nonspecific chain extension of plasmid dna fragments.
the anti-sigma factors.
a mechanism for regulating gene expression at the level of transcription utilizes an antagonist of the sigma transcription factor known as the anti-sigma (anti-sigma) factor. the cytoplasmic class of anti-sigma factors has been well characterized. the class includes asia form bacteriophage t4, which inhibits escherichia coli sigma 70; flgm, present in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which inhibits the flagella sigma factor sigma 28; spoiiab, which inhibits the sporulation-specific sigma factor, sigma f and sigma g, of bacillus subtilis; rbsw of b. subtilis, which inhibits stress response sigma factor sigma b; and dnak, a general regulator of the heat shock response, which in bacteria inhibits the heat shock sigma factor sigma 32. in addition to this class of well-characterized cytoplasmic anti-sigma factors, a new class of homologous, inner-membrane-bound anti-sigma factors has recently been discovered in a variety of eubacteria. this new class of anti-sigma factors regulates the expression of so-called extracytoplasmic functions, and hence is known as the ecf subfamily of anti-sigma factors. the range of cell processes regulated by anti-sigma factors is highly varied and includes bacteriophage phage growth, sporulation, stress response, flagellar biosynthesis, pigment production, ion transport, and virulence.
choice of microbial host for the naphthalene dioxygenase bioconversion.
the use of whole cell biotransformations for single and multistep enzyme conversions is gaining widespread application. in this study the naphthalene dioxygenase nah a gene was transferred into pseudomonas aeruginosa pac 1r, escherichia coli jm107 and pseudomonas putida ppg 277. the effect of ethanol on these genetically engineered gram-negative bacteria was studied by measurement of enzyme activity, stability and cell integrity. ethanol has been used in biotransformations as a co-substrate carbon source for co-factor recycling and as a co-solvent increasing dissolved substrate and product levels. ethanol increased the dissolved substrate (naphthalene) concentration slightly and dissolved product ((+)-cis-(1r,2s)-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene) by approximately 30% at 4% (w/v) ethanol. both p. aeruginosa pac 1r and p. putida ppg 277 showed decreased activity with increasing ethanol concentration whilst e. coli enzyme activity increased with increasing ethanol concentration being comparable to that when glucose was used as a carbon source. this project highlighted the many factors involved in the selection of microbial hosts for whole cell biotransformation processes.
carbon source-dependent inhibition of xyl operon expression of the pseudomonas putida tol plasmid.
tol plasmid-encoded degradation of benzyl alcohol by pseudomonas putida is inhibited by glucose and other compounds related to the main carbohydrate metabolism in pseudomonas species. we report here that this effect is exerted at the level of expression of the xyl catabolic operons, and two xyl promoters, pu and ps, were identified as the primary targets of this inhibition. xyl promoter activation was also inhibited by glucose in the heterologous escherichia coli system, apparently not however by the classical mechanism of enteric catabolite repression.
antimicrobial activity and biosynthesis of indole antibiotics produced by xenorhabdus nematophilus.
we have investigated the mechanism of action and physiology of production of the  indole derivative antibiotics produced by the nematode-associated, entomopathogenic bacterium xenorhabdus nematophilus. maximum antibiotic concentration was reached during the late stationary phase of growth, and the antibiotic yield was appreciably enhanced by supplementation with tryptophan. antibiotic biosynthesis apparently involved the removal of the side-chain carboxyl (c-1) carbon of tryptophan. the c-3 methylene carbon of tryptophan, on the other hand, was retained. the purified indole antibiotic was effective against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria at low to moderate concentrations causing a severe inhibition of rna synthesis, accompanied by a less severe effect on protein synthesis. an isogenic pair of escherichia coli strains differing at the rela locus was used to demonstrate that the swift reduction in total rna synthesis is related to an antibiotic-induced accumulation of the regulatory nucleotide, ppgpp, in susceptible bacteria. the e. coli rela mutant, which does not exhibit any discernible increase in ppgpp upon antibiotic treatment, showed no decrease in growth or rna synthesis. using this antibiotic, it was also observed that ppgpp may be employed as a metabolic regulator in bacteria such as pseudomonas putida, which have not previously been reported to employ ppgpp as a regulatory molecule. we propose that the indole derivative antibiotic exerts growth inhibitory control in susceptible bacteria by greatly enhancing synthesis of ppgpp, resulting in a rapid inhibition of rna synthesis.
application of a tetrazolium salt with a water-soluble formazan as an indicator of viability in respiring bacteria.
the tetrazolium salt sodium 3'-{1-[(phenylamino)-carbonyl]-3,4-tetrazolium}-bis (4-methoxy-6-nitro)benzene-sulfonic acid hydrate (xtt) was examined for use as a colorimetric indicator of viability in respiring bacteria. xtt was reduced to an orange, water-soluble formazan product by methylosinus trichosporium ob3b, pseudomonas putida, escherichia coli, and bacillus subtilis. formazan production was proportional to live cell biomass, and xtt was reduced by all cultures in the absence of added electron-coupling agents. xtt reduction by m. trichosporium ob3b was linear over several hours and was stimulated by the presence of an exogenous substrate (methanol). addition of cyanide to cultures incubated under oxic conditions gave an initial 10-fold increase in xtt reduction. viability of bacteria incubated in the absence of exogenous carbon substrates was measured as xtt reduction and compared with viability estimates from plate counts. results obtained with the two methods were generally comparable, but the xtt assay was superior when cell recovery on plates was low. incubation of e. coli for 7 days in the absence of exogenous carbon substrates decreased viability by 90%, whereas the corresponding decreases for cultures of m. trichosporium ob3b, p. putida, and b. subtilis were less than 40%.
an upstream xylr- and ihf-induced nucleoprotein complex regulates the sigma 54-dependent pu promoter of tol plasmid.
transcription from promoter pu of the upper catabolic operon of the pseudomonas putida tol plasmid which specifies conversion of toluene/xylenes to benzoate/toluates is activated by the tol-encoded regulator xylr protein in the presence of substrates of the catabolic pathway and in conjunction with the sigma 54(ntra)-containing form of rna polymerase. this regulatory circuit was faithfully reproduced in escherichia coli in single copy gene dosage by integrating the corresponding controlling determinants into the chromosomes of several k12 derivatives by means of specialized transposons. in vivo monitoring of the activity of a pu-lacz fusion in e. coli strains with different genetic backgrounds demonstrated that integration host factor (ihf) is involved in pu regulation and that hyperproduction of the xylr protein leads to a decrease of pu activity in a manner in which deletion of the putative dna-binding domain of the xylr does not impair its inhibitory effect when hyperproduced. one discrete ihf binding site and two potential xylr sites (consensus sequence 5'-ttgancaaatc-3'), bracketted by short stretches of dnase i-hypersensitive bonds, were detected upstream of the transcription initiation site. a model accounting for the features found is proposed which includes the ihf-promoted looping of upstream xylr-dna complexes so that they contact the sigma 54(ntra)-rna polymerase bound at -12/-24 positions.
trichloroethylene degradation by escherichia coli containing the cloned pseudomonas putida f1 toluene dioxygenase genes.
toluene dioxygenase from pseudomonas putida f1 has been implicated as an enzyme capable of degrading trichloroethylene. this has now been confirmed with escherichia coli jm109(pdtg601) that contains the structural genes (todc1c2ba) of toluene dioxygenase under the control of the tac promoter. the extent of trichloroethylene degradation by the recombinant organism depended on the cell concentration and the concentration of trichloroethylene. a linear rate of trichloroethylene degradation was observed with the e. coli recombinant strain. in contrast, p. putida f39/d, a mutant strain of p. putida f1 that does not contain cis-toluene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, showed a much faster initial rate of trichloroethylene degradation which decreased over time.
putidaredoxin competitively inhibits cytochrome b5-cytochrome p-450cam association: a proposed molecular model for a cytochrome p-450cam electron-transfer complex.
cytochrome b5 has been genetically engineered to afford a fluorescent derivative  capable of monitoring its association with cytochrome p-450cam from pseudomonas putida [stayton, p. s., fisher, m. t., & sligar, s. g. (1988) j. biol. chem. 263, 13544-13548]. in the mutant cytochrome b5, threonine is replaced by a cysteine at position 65 (t65c) and has been labeled with the environmentally sensitive fluorophore acrylodan. in this paper, the physiological p-450cam reductant putidaredoxin, an fe2s2.cys4 iron-sulfur protein, is shown to competitively inhibit the cytochrome b5 association, suggesting that cytochrome b5 and putidaredoxin bind to a similar site on the cytochrome p-450cam surface. since the crystal structures for both cytochrome b5 and cytochrome p-450cam have been solved to high resolution, the complex has been computer modeled, and a good fit was found on the proximal surface of nearest approach to the p-450cam heme prosthetic group. the proposed model includes electrostatic contacts between conserved cytochrome b5 carboxylates glu-44, glu-48, asp-60, and the exposed heme propionate with cytochrome p-450cam basic residues lys-344, arg-72, arg-112, and arg-364, respectively. putidaredoxin has similarly been shown to contain a carboxylate-based binding surface, and the current results suggest that if the model is correct, then it also interacts at the proposed site, probably utilizing similar p-450cam electrostatic contacts.
physiological comparison of d-cysteine desulfhydrase of escherichia coli with 3-chloro-d-alanine dehydrochlorinase of pseudomonas putida cr 1-1.
d-cysteine desulfhydrase of escherichia coli w3110 delta trped102/f' delta trped102 was physiologically characterized. it was found to be located in the cytosolic fraction, as 3-chloro-d-alanine dehydrochlorinase is. d-cysteine desulfhydrase catalyzed not only the alpha, beta-elimination reaction of o-acetyl-d-serine to form pyruvate, acetic acid and ammonia, but also the beta-replacement reaction of o-acetyl-d-serine with sulfide to form d-cysteine. however, these reactions appeared not to proceed in vivo. no other activity of d-cysteine synthesis from o-acetyl-d-serine and sulfide was detected in a crude cell extract of e. coli which was immunotitrated with antibodies raised against the purified d-cysteine desulfhydrase. although d-cysteine desulfhydrase catalyzes the degradation (alpha, beta-elimination reaction) of 3-chloro-d-alanine, which is an effective antibacterial agent, e. coli w3110 delta trped102/f' delta trped102 did not show resistance against 3-chloro-d-alanine. therefore, d-cysteine desulfhydrase does not contribute to 3-chloro-d-alanine detoxification in vivo.
molecular cloning of the pseudomonas putida glyoxalase i gene in escherichia coli.
the glyoxalase i gene of pseudomonas putida was cloned onto a vector plasmid pbr  322 as a 7.5 kilobase sau 3ai fragment of chromosomal dna and the hybrid plasmid was designated pgi 318. the gene responsible for the glyoxalase i activity in pgi 318 was recloned in pbr 322 as a 2.2 kilobase hin diii fragment and was designated pgi 423. the p. putida glyoxalase i gene on pgi 318 and pgi 423 was highly expressed in e. coli cells and the glyoxalase i activity level was increased more than 150 fold in the pgi 423 bearing strain compared with that of e. coli cells without pgi 423. the e. coli transformants harboring pgi 318 or pgi 423 could grow normally in the presence of methylglyoxal, although the e. coli cells without plasmid were inhibited to grow and showed the extremely elongated cell shape.
[ability to survive and interactions of selected bacterial species in activated carbon filters].
the survival and the interactions of selected, hygienically relevant bacterial species in activated carbon filters was investigated. the numbers of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and p. putida increased in previously sterilized filters. after inoculation all bacteria (10(6] were adsorbed. during a period of 6-10 days the filter effluent contained no detectable bacteria. after that the colony numbers increased to a constant level of 10(4)-10(5) colony forming units (cfu)/ml effluent and 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g activated carbon. klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis died off in the filter system. if the filters were inoculated simultaneously with two species, p. putida and p. aeruginosa remained at a constant level between 10(4) and 10(5) cfu/ml. e. coli was suppressed by p. aeruginosa and died off in the presence of p. putida. as in-vitro tests indicated, p. putida did not produce inhibitory substances against p. aeruginosa or e. coli. on the other hand, p. aeruginosa showed antagonistic activities against e. coli.
survival of selected bacterial species in sterilized activated carbon filters and biological activated carbon filters.
the survival of selected hygienically relevant bacterial species in activated carbon (ac) filters on a bench scale was investigated. the results revealed that after inoculation of the test strains the previously sterilized ac absorbed all bacteria (10(6) to 10(7)). after a period of 6 to 13 days without countable bacteria in the effluent, the numbers of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and pseudomonas putida increased up to 10(4) to 10(5) cfu/ml of effluent and 10(6) to 10(7) cfu/g of ac. when klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis were used, no growth in filters could be observed. the numbers of e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and p. putida, however, decreased immediately and showed no regrowth in nonsterile ac from a filter which had been continuously connected to running tap water for 2 months. under these conditions an autochthonous microflora developed on the carbon surface which could be demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy and culturing methods (heterotrophic plate count). these bacteria reduced e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and p. putida densities in the effluent by a factor of more than 10(5) within 1 to 5 days. the hypothesis that antagonistic substances of the autochthonous microflora were responsible for the elimination of the artificial contamination could not be confirmed because less than 1% of the isolates of the autochthonous microflora were able to produce such substances as indicated by in vitro tests. competition for limiting nutrients was thought to be the reason for the observed effects.
analysis of the vegetative replication origin of broad-host-range plasmid rk2 by  transposon mutagenesis.
a range of tn1723 transposon mutants of the oriv region of broad-host-range plasmid rk2 have been isolated, and the internal ecori fragment of the transposon has been deleted from each to reduce the insertion size from 9.6 kb (tn1723) to 35 bp (delta tn1723). sequencing from the delta tn1723-derived ecori site has allowed the precise mapping of these insertions to various points dispersed through the origin region. using these mutants we have determined which regions of oriv rk2 are of functional importance to plasmid establishment following transformation of the host species escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, and p. aeruginosa. insertions into an a/t-rich region, and a region containing five direct repeat sequences prevented successful transformation of each host species tested, but the continuity of sequences adjacent to the five repeats were essential only in e. coli and p. putida. the establishment and maintenance in e. coli of a mini-rk2 replicon was found to be inhibited by transcription from an inducible promoter positioned to read into oriv rk2 against the direction of replication. assays of transcription emerging from tn1723 demonstrated significant levels from one end of the transposon only. four mutants with insertions downstream of oriv rk2 were unable to become established in e. coli, and contained tn1723 in the orientation which would supply transcription toward the oriv rk2 region. these results demonstrate both that the sequence requirements for oriv rk2 function differ between host bacterial species, and that origin function may be further influenced by the genetic environment in which it lies.
impact of cefotaxime on the fecal flora in children.
a differential quantitative analysis was used to study the effect of cefotaxime on the fecal flora in 26 hospitalized children ranging from two days to four years of age. fecal specimens were obtained before, during and after therapy. this study was evaluated in comparison to 41 patients of the same age and from the same environment without antibiotic treatment or signs of infection. the fecal flora of the control group showed qualitative and quantitative stability. two groups of species were distinguished: a group in which the upper limit was less than or equal to 10(7) bacteria/g of stool (klebsiella, enterobacter, other enterobacteria, staphylococcus, pseudomonas) and a group with less than or equal to 10(10) bacteria/g of stool (anaerobes, escherichia coli, streptococcus d). this stability of the control group of subjects allowed us to interpret the variations of microbial concentrations during and after cefotaxime treatment. in previous studies, we showed in the newborn a substantial risk of septicemia of intestinal origin when overgrowth occurred, especially with klebsiella. with cefotaxime there was a decrease or a disappearance in 65% of e. coli and a slight decrease of klebsiella and enterobacter. this fact was of great interest in the treatment of endogenous secondary septicemia. we observed an appearance of pseudomonas (nine pseudomonas aeruginosa, two pseudomonas putida, one pseudomonas fluorescens) in 12 cases among the 26 children treated.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
[study of the microbial multiplication in the muscle just after slaughter (author's transl)].
the bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity of the serum, the muscle and the rabbit meat juice was followed after slaughter on animals vaccinated or not against e. coli, p. putida, cl. perfringens. rabbit serum is bactericidal against gram negative bacteria, p. putida and e. coli. on the contrary it is without effect on cl. perfringens. muscle has no inhibitory effect against e. coli and cl. perfringens on animals vaccinated or not. p. putida is inhibited or partially eliminated from rabbit muscle just after slaughter. vaccination does not increase the bacteriostatic or bactericidal activities of the sera, the meat juices and intact muscles.
