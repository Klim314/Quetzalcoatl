competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
objective: to investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. material and methods: the antimicrobial activity of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains. four probiotic bacterial species (lactobacillus bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium) were isolated from yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. results: fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. in addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', streptococcus sanguinis. the competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. when probiotics were inoculated first, bifidobacterium inhibited porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas circumdentaria, and prevotella nigrescens; l. acidophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. circumdentaria, p. nigrescens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius; l. bulgaricus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. nigrescens; and s. thermophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and p. nigrescens. however, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens) were inoculated simultaneously. when periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, prevotella intermedia inhibited bifidobacterium and s. thermophilus. conclusions: the results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.
in vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. this study aimed to obtain recombinant hbd3 (rhbd3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of hbd3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. genetic engineering was used to obtain active rhbd3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals, including fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans. in an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rhbd3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. the ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. we conclude that hbd3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.
the use of pcr for the identification and characterisation of bacteriocin genes from bacterial strains isolated from rumen or caecal contents of cattle and sheep.
pcr primers were designed to amplify the gene that encodes bovicin 255 from streptococcus gallolyticus lrc0255 and the bacteriocin genes from butyrivibrio fibrisolvens strains ar10 and or79a (bvid and bvi79a) in order to screen for their incidence in rumen and caecal b. fibrisolvens and streptococcus bovis-like isolates from new zealand and north american ruminants. none of the b. fibrisolvens-like strains (n=34) isolated from new zealand or north america had the genes encoding for butyrivibriocins ar10 (bvid) or or79 (bvi79a). however, seven s. bovis isolates from new zealand ruminants and three from north american animals had the bovicin 255 gene. sequence comparison of cloned bovicin 255 pcr products indicated a 92.9-95.7% similarity to that of the corresponding bovicin 255 gene sequence of s. gallolyticus. four of the new zealand bovicin 255 positive s. bovis isolates were from the caecal contents of the same sheep and had identical pfge profiles. two other s. bovis isolates sharing the same pfge profile were isolated from a separate animal from the same flock. pfge analysis of the north american strains indicated that all three were closely related as two of three had identical pfge profiles with the remaining isolate differing only by a single band position. the 16s rrna gene sequences of the 10 isolates were at least 99.8% identical to s. bovis. all 10 s. bovis isolates having the gene for bovicin 255 produced bacteriocin activity that inhibited the growth of peptostreptococcus anaerobius d1 in a deferred antagonism plating (dap) assay. certain s. bovis isolates obtained from ruminants have bacteriocin activity associated with a distinct bovicin 255 gene sequence but it appears that bacteriocin production by the rumen anaerobe b. fibrisolvens may be uncommon in strains isolated from cattle and sheep in new zealand.
