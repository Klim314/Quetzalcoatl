TI  == characterization of the tet m determinants in urogenital and respiratory bacteria.
AB  == tetracycline-resistant fusobacterium nucleatum, haemophilus ducreyi, mycoplasma hominis, peptostreptococcus spp., ureaplasma urealyticum, and veillonella parvula had dna sequences which showed homology throughout the length of the tet m transposon, tn916. in contrast, gardnerella vaginalis, commensal neisseria spp.,  and the 25.2-megadalton plasmid family lacked the complete transposon.

TI  == differentiation of some species of neisseriaceae and other bacterial groups by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == dna-dna hybridization using total genomic dna probes may represent a way of differentiating between miscellaneous bacterial species. this was studied with type and reference strains of 20 species in moraxella, kingella, and other selected gram-negative groups. both radioactive and biotin labelling were employed. most of the species examined were easily distinguished, such as moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, m.(b.) ovis, m. atlantae, m. phenylpyruvica, m. osloensis, neisseria elongata, n. meningitidis, kingella kingae, k. indologenes, k. dentrificans, oligella urethralis, eikenella corrodens, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus aphrophilus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, gardnerella vaginalis, and df-2. this reflected the extent of the genetic distances between them as a basis for identification by hybridization. there was some clustering in the moraxella group. especially the closely related moraxella nonliquefaciens, m. lacunata and m. bovis showed strong hybridization affinities. this leads to potential problems in distinguishing these three species from each other by dna-dna hybridization with total genomic probes alone.

TI  == identification of neisseria spp., haemophilus spp., and other fastidious gram-negative bacteria with the microscan haemophilus-neisseria identification panel.
AB  == the haemophilus-neisseria identification (hnid) panel (american microscan, sacramento, calif.) is a 4-h microdilution format system for identification of haemophilus and neisseria spp., branhamella (moraxella) catarrhalis, and gardnerella vaginalis. the hnid panel was evaluated by using 423 clinical isolates and stock strains of these organisms, and hnid identifications were compared with those obtained by conventional methods. in addition, 32 isolates representing six genera not included in the hnid data base were tested to determine whether these organisms would produce unique biotype numbers for possible inclusion in the data base. the hnid panel correctly identified 95.3% of 86 neisseria gonorrhoeae strains, 96% of 25 g. vaginalis strains, and 100% of 28  neisseria lactamica strains and 48 b. catarrhalis strains. only 64.7% of 68 neisseria meningitidis isolates were identified correctly owing to false-negative or equivocal carbohydrate and/or aminopeptidase reactions. among the haemophilus  spp., 98.8% of 83 h. influenzae strains, 97.1% of 34 h. parainfluenzae strains, and 80% of 15 h. aphrophilus and h. paraphrophilus strains were correctly identified. eight strains of neisseria cinerea, a species not included in the data base, produced profiles identical with those for b. catarrhalis and n. gonorrhoeae. isolates of other species not included in the data base, including eikenella corrodens, kingella spp., and cardiobacterium hominis, produced unique  biochemical reaction patterns on the panel. modification of interpretative criteria for certain tests, expansion of the data base to include other species,  and suggestions for additional confirmatory tests will increase the accuracy and  utility of the hnid panel.

TI  == clinical evaluation of the vitek neisseria-haemophilus identification card.
AB  == a clinical evaluation of the vitek neisseria-haemophilus identification (nhi) card (vitek systems, inc., hazelwood, mo.) was performed with 480 clinical isolates and stock strains of neisseria spp., haemophilus spp., and other fastidious microorganisms included in the data base of the system. identifications obtained with the nhi card were compared with those determined by conventional methods. the card identified 83.2% of 244 neisseria spp. and branhamella catarrhalis, 54.9% of 164 haemophilus spp., and 84.7% of 72 fastidious gram-negative species with no further testing required. some isolates  produced good confidence-marginal separation identifications, in which the correct identification was listed with one or two other possible identifications  and extra tests were required and suggested. when isolates producing good confidence-marginal separation identifications were included, correct identifications of these organism groups increased to 97.1, 92.7, and 94.4%, respectively. among the commonly isolated microorganisms, the nhi card identified 99.1% of 110 n. gonorrhoeae, 98.5% of 68 n. meningitidis, 93.9% of 98 h. influenzae, and 95.6% of 46 h. parainfluenzae strains. all of these organisms produced excellent to very good confidence level identifications except for h. influenzae biotypes ii, iii, and vii, for which hemolytic reactions were required for differentiation from h. haemolyticus. the nhi card reliably identified other  fastidious gram-negative species, including h. aphrophilus, eikenella corrodens,  gardnerella vaginalis, and kingella denitrificans.

TI  == measurement of microbial alpha-amylases with p-nitrophenyl glycosides as the substrate complex.
AB  == the detection of alpha-amylase is commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories to aid in differentiating streptococcus bovis from other streptococci. it is also useful in identifying eikenella corrodens and the gravis subspecies of corynebacterium diphtheriae and in separating species of the genera bacteroides, clostridium, actinomyces, and bacillus. currently, the most frequently used procedure utilizes starch as the substrate and iodine as the indicator. starch is incorporated into a agar medium, the isolate is inoculated on the surface, and the medium is incubated for 24 to 48 h. a 15-min test containing p-nitrophenyl polyglycosides as the substrate complex was developed to yield results comparable with the agar-based starch test. the reagent was made in liquid form, 0.20 ml per tube, and could be incubated either in ambient air or at 35 degrees c. when dried, the p-nitrophenyl polyglycoside reagent could be stored at 0 degrees c for 4 weeks.
