TI  == characterization of atpase activity of the aaa arc from bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis.
AB  == bifidobacteria are considered to be probiotics that exist in the large intestine  and are helpful to maintain human health. oral administration of bifidobacteria may be effective in improving the intestinal flora and environment, stimulating the immune response and possibly preventing cancer. however, for consistent and positive results, further well-controlled studies are urgently needed to describe the basic mechanisms of this microorganism. analysis of the proteasome-lacking bifidobacterium longum genome reveals that it possesses a gene, ipr003593 aaa atpase core, which codes a 56 kda protein containing one aaa atpase domain. phylogenetic classification made by clans, positioned this sequence into the arc  divergent branch of the aaa atpase family of proteins. n-terminal analysis of the sequence indicates this protein is closely related to other atpases such as the rhodococcus erythropolis arc, archaeoglobus fulgidus pan, mycobacterium tuberculosis mpa and the human proteasomal rpt1 subunit. this gene was cloned, the full-length recombinant protein was overexpressed in escherichia coli, purified as a high-molecular size complex and named bl-arc. enzymatic characterization showed that bl-arc atpase is active, mg+2-dependent and sensitive to n-ethylmaleimide. gene organization positions bl-arc in a region flanked by a cluster of genes that includes pup, dop and pafa genes. these findings point to a possible function as a chaperone in the degradation pathway via pupylation.

TI  == intestinal microbiota and allergic diseases: a systematic review.
AB  == evidence suggests that possible imbalances in intestinal microbiota composition may be implicated in the occurrence of allergic diseases. although several studies published until 2006 indicated a correlation between microbiota composition and allergic symptoms, it has not been possible to distinguish protective microorganisms from those associated with increased risk of allergic diseases. therefore, the objective of this study was to review the studies published since 2007 that address the intestinal microbiota in allergic diseases. twenty-one studies were identified after excluding those that performed a clinical intervention before stool collection. in the early microbiota of children who later developed allergies, lower bacterial diversity was observed, with a predominance of firmicutes; a higher count of bacteroidaceae; a higher prevalence of the anaerobic bacteria bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum, and  bifidobacterium longum; and a lower prevalence of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, and lactobacillus. in the microbiota of allergic children whose intestinal microbiota was assessed at the onset of allergic symptoms, there was a higher count of bacteroides; a lower count of akkermansia muciniphila, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and clostridium; a higher prevalence of b. adolescentis; a lower prevalence of b. catenulatum and staphylococcus aureus; and a lower bacterial diversity.

TI  == activation of the chromosomally encoded mazef(bif) locus of bifidobacterium longum under acid stress.
AB  == toxin-antitoxin (ta) systems are distributed within the genomes of almost all free-living bacteria. although the roles of chromosomally encoded ta systems are  still under debate, they are suspected to be involved in various stress responses. here, we provide the first report of a type ii ta system in the probiotic bacterium bifidobacterium longum. bioinformatic analysis of the b. longum jdm301 genome identified a pair of linked genes encoding a mazef-like ta system at the locus blj_811-blj_812. our results showed that b. longum mazef(bif) genes form a bicistronic operon. the over-expression of mazf(bif) was toxic to escherichia coli and could be neutralized by the co-expression of its cognate antitoxin maze(bif). we demonstrated that mazef(bif) was activated during acid stress, which would most likely be encountered in the gastrointestinal tract. in  addition, we found that the protease clppx(bif), in addition to mazef(bif), was induced under acid stress. furthermore, we examined antitoxin levels over time for mazef(bif) and observed that the antitoxin maze(bif) was degraded by clppx(bif), which suggested that mazef(bif) was activated through the hydrolysis  of maze(bif) by clpp1x(bif) and clpp2x(bif) under acid stress. our results suggest that the mazef(bif) ta module may play an important role in cell physiology and may represent a cell growth modulator that helps bacteria to cope  with acid stress in the gastrointestinal tract and environment.

TI  == lactobacillus gasseri ks-13, bifidobacterium bifidum g9-1, and bifidobacterium longum mm-2 ingestion induces a less inflammatory cytokine profile and a potentially beneficial shift in gut microbiota in older adults: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study.
AB  == objective: this study determined whether older adults who consumed a probiotic mixture would have a greater proportion of circulating cd4+ lymphocytes, altered  cytokine production, and a shift in intestinal microbiota toward a healthier microbial community. methods: participants (70 +/- 1 years [mean +/- sem]; n = 32) consumed a probiotic (lactobacillus gasseri ks-13, bifidobacterium bifidum g9-1, and bifidobacterium longum mm2) or a placebo twice daily for 3 weeks with a 5-week washout period between intervention periods. blood and stools were collected before and after each intervention. the percentage of circulating cd4+  lymphocytes and ex vivo mitogen-stimulated cell cytokine production were measured. in stools, specific bacterial targets were quantified via quantitative  polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) and community composition was determined via pyrosequencing. results: during the first period of the crossover the percentage  of cd4+ cells decreased with the placebo (48% +/- 3% to 31% +/- 3%, p < 0.01) but did not change with the probiotic (44% +/- 3% to 42% +/- 3%) and log-transformed  concentrations of interleukin-10 increased with the probiotic (1.7 +/- 0.2 to 3.4 +/- 0.2, p < 0.0001) but not the placebo (1.7 +/- 0.2 to 2.1 +/- 0.2). with the probiotic versus the placebo a higher percentage of participants had an increase  in fecal bifidobacteria (48% versus 30%, p < 0.05) and lactic acid bacteria (55%  versus 43%, p < 0.05) and a decrease in escherichia coli (52% versus 27%, p < 0.05). several bacterial groups matching faeacalibactierium prausnitzii were more prevalent in stool samples with the probiotic versus placebo. conclusions: the probiotic maintained cd4+ lymphocytes and produced a less inflammatory cytokine profile possibly due to the changes in the microbial communities, which more closely resembled those reported in healthy younger populations.

TI  == nitrate reduction to nitrite, nitric oxide and ammonia by gut bacteria under physiological conditions.
AB  == the biological nitrogen cycle involves step-wise reduction of nitrogen oxides to  ammonium salts and oxidation of ammonia back to nitrites and nitrates by plants and bacteria. neither process has been thought to have relevance to mammalian physiology; however in recent years the salivary bacterial reduction of nitrate to nitrite has been recognized as an important metabolic conversion in humans. several enteric bacteria have also shown the ability of catalytic reduction of nitrate to ammonia via nitrite during dissimilatory respiration; however, the importance of this pathway in bacterial species colonizing the human intestine has been little studied. we measured nitrite, nitric oxide (no) and ammonia formation in cultures of escherichia coli, lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species grown at different sodium nitrate concentrations and oxygen levels. we found that the presence of 5 mm nitrate provided a growth benefit and induced both nitrite and ammonia generation in e.coli and l.plantarum bacteria grown at oxygen concentrations compatible with the content in the gastrointestinal tract.  nitrite and ammonia accumulated in the growth medium when at least 2.5 mm nitrate was present. time-course curves suggest that nitrate is first converted to nitrite and subsequently to ammonia. strains of l.rhamnosus, l.acidophilus and b.longum infantis grown with nitrate produced minor changes in nitrite or ammonia levels in the cultures. however, when supplied with exogenous nitrite, no gas was readily produced independently of added nitrate. bacterial production of lactic acid causes medium acidification that in turn generates no by non-enzymatic nitrite reduction. in contrast, nitrite was converted to no by e.coli cultures even at neutral ph. we suggest that the bacterial nitrate reduction to ammonia, as well as the related no formation in the gut, could be an important aspect of the overall mammalian nitrate/nitrite/no metabolism and is yet another way in which the microbiome links diet and health.

TI  == cocktails of probiotics pre-adapted to multiple stress factors are more robust under simulated gastrointestinal conditions than their parental counterparts and  exhibit enhanced antagonistic capabilities against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == background: the success of the probiotics in delivery of health benefits depends  on their ability to withstand the technological and gastrointestinal conditions;  hence development of robust cultures is critical to the probiotic industry. combinations of probiotic cultures have proven to be more effective than the use  of single cultures for treatment and prevention of heterogeneous diseases. we investigated the effect of pre- adaptation of probiotics to multiple stresses on  their stability under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and the effect of their singular as well as their synergistic antagonistic effect against selected  enteric pathogens. methods: probiotic cultures were inoculated into mrs broth adjusted to ph 2 and incubated for 2 h at 37 degrees c. survivors of ph 2 were subcultured into 2% bile acid for 1 h at 37 degrees c. cells that showed growth after exposure to 2% bile acid for 1 h were finally inoculated in fresh mrs broth and incubated at 55 degrees c for 2 h. the cells surviving were then used as stress adapted cultures. the adapted cultures were exposed to simulated gastrointestinal conditions and their non- adapted counterparts were used to compare the effects of stress adaptation. the combination cultures were tested for their antipathogenic effects on escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. results: acid and bile tolerances of most of the stress-adapted cells were higher than of the non-adapted cells. viable counts of all the stress-adapted lactobacilli and bifidobacterium longum lmg 13197 were higher after sequential exposure to simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. however, for b. longum bb46  and b. bifidum lmg 13197, viability of non-adapted cells was higher than for adapted cells after exposure to these fluids. a cocktail containing l. plantarum  + b. longum bb46 + b. longum lmg 13197 best inhibited s. aureus while e. coli was best inhibited by a combination containing l. acidophilus la14 150b + b. longum bb46 + b. bifidum lmg 11041. a cocktail containing the six non- adapted cultures  was the least effective in inhibiting the pathogens. conclusion: multi-stress pre-adaptation enhances viability of probiotics under simulated gastrointestinal  conditions; and formulations containing a mixture of multi stress-adapted cells exhibits enhanced synergistic effects against foodborne pathogens.

TI  == isolation and transposition properties of isblo11, an active insertion sequence belonging to the is3 family, from bifidobacterium longum 105-a.
AB  == transposon mutagenesis systems are still under development in bifidobacteria, partly because intrinsic active insertion sequences are not well characterized in bifidobacteria. here, we isolated an active insertion sequence, isblo11, from bifidobacterium longum 105-a using a sacb-based counterselection system, which is generally used to screen for active insertion sequences from bacterial genomes. isblo11 is 1432 bp long and belongs to the is3 family. it has a single orf encoding a transposase and 25-bp inverted repeats at its termini. full-length copies of isblo11 are specifically conserved among certain b. longum genomes and  exist in different sites. transposition analysis of an artificial isblo11 transposon using an escherichia coli conjugation system revealed that isblo11 has adequate transposition activity, comparable to the reported activity of is629, another is3 family element initially isolated from shigella sonnei. isblo11 also  showed low transposition selectivity for non-conserved 3- or 4-bp target sequences. these characteristics of isblo11 seem suitable for the development of  a new transposon mutagenesis system in bifidobacteria.

TI  == bacterial community structure associated with elective cesarean section versus vaginal delivery in chinese newborns.
AB  == objectives: increasing attention is being paid to the potential for cesarean birth to influence the taxa of the bacteria that compose the infant intestinal microbiota. the present study characterized the diversity of the intestinal microbiota in newborn infants delivered vaginally (vd) or by cesarean section (cd). methods: a cross-sectional study was performed using fecal specimens collected on days 2 and 4 of postnatal life from 25 vd infants and 16 cd infants. profiles of the fecal microbiota were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis in combination with 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene sequencing of the clones corresponding to the degenerating gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) bands. results: on days 2 and 4 of postnatal  life, vd and cd infants did not differ in the richness and evenness of the fecal  bacterial community; however, the taxa of the fecal microbiota were significantly different between the 2 groups. in vd infants, escherichia coli, bacteroides sp,  and bifidobacterium longum were the dominant microbes. in cd infants, staphylococcus sp, clostridium sp, enterobacter sp, and streptococcus sp were more common. conclusions: these results demonstrate that delivery method has a profound influence on the structure of the intestinal microbiota in chinese newborn infants. this is in accordance with data reported in other regions.

TI  == multi-functional glycoside hydrolase: blon_0625 from bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis atcc 15697.
AB  == we here describe a unique beta-d-glucosidase (bgl; blon_0625) derived from bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis atcc 15697. the blon_0625 gene was expressed by recombinant escherichia coli. purified recombinant blon_0625 retains hydrolyzing activity against both p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside (pnpg; 17.3+/-0.24umg(-1)) and p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-xylopyranoside (pnpx; 16.7+/-0.32umg(-1)) at ph 6.0, 30 degrees c. to best of our knowledge, no previously described bgl retains the same level of both pnpgase and pnpxase activity. furthermore, blon_0625 also retains the activity against 4-nitrophenyl-alpha-l-arabinofranoside (pnpaf; 5.6+/-0.09umg(-1)). in addition, the results of the degradation of phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (pasc) or xylan using endoglucanase from thermobifida fusca yx (tfu_0901) or xylanase from  kitasatospora setae km-6054 (kse_59480) show that blon_0625 acts as a bgl and as  a beta-d-xylosidase (xyl) for hydrolyzing oligosaccharides. these results clearly indicate that blon_0625 is a multi-functional glycoside hydrolase which retains the activity of bgl, xyl, and also alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase. therefore, the utilization of multi-functional blon_0625 may contribute to facilitating the efficient degradation of lignocellulosic materials and help enhance bioconversion processes.

TI  == the effect of a multi-strain probiotic on the resistance toward escherichia coli  challenge in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind intervention study.
AB  == background: several probiotic strains have been shown to enhance human resistance to infectious disease. it is speculated that these strains may impose this effect by excretion of anti-microbial components, by competing with pathogens for intestinal nutrients and/or mucosal adhesion sites or modulating the immune system. objective: a parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled 4-week intervention was performed in healthy males, to study the effect of a blend of probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus helveticus rosell-52, lactobacillus rhamnosus rosell-11, bifidobacterium longum ssp. longum rosell-175) and a probiotic yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae var boulardii cncm i-1079) on enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) challenge. primary outcomes studied were fecal etec excretion and total fecal output per day. subjects/methods: subjects were randomized to the probiotic (5 x 10(9) colony-forming units (cfus); twice daily;  n=30) or placebo group (twice daily; n=30). after 2 weeks, subjects were orally challenged with a live attenuated etec (3 x 10(9) cfu), previously demonstrated to induce mild, short-lived symptoms of a foodborne infection. before and after etec challenge, subjects collected 24 h fecal samples. compliance to study guidelines, stool consistency (bristol stool score), stool frequency, and frequency and severity of gastrointestinal (gi) complaints were recorded by the subjects on a daily record questionnaire. results: etec challenge induced a significant increase in fecal etec excretion in both groups. however, a statistically significant increase in fecal output was only observed in the probiotic group. etec challenge resulted in a decrease in the percentage of fecal dry weight, and an increase in reported bristol stool score, stool frequency and  gi complaints. dietary probiotics significantly decreased the percentage of fecal dry weight. in addition, etec increased c-reactive protein, total secretory immunoglobulin a (iga) and immunoglobulin g colonization factor antigen ii. conclusion: dietary probiotics did not increase resistance to oral attenuated etec challenge in human subjects.

TI  == prebiotic oligosaccharides: comparative evaluation using in vitro cultures of infants' fecal microbiomes.
AB  == the objective of this study was to systematically assess the bifidogenic effect of three commonly used prebiotic products using in vitro cultures of infant fecal samples. fresh stool samples collected from six term infants, each exclusively fed human milk (n = 3) or infant formula (n = 3), at 28 days of age were used as  inocula. the following prebiotic products were added at concentrations applicable to infant formula: vivinal gos 15 (containing 28.5% galacto-oligosaccharide [gos]) at 7.2 g/liter, beneo hp (99.5% long-chain inulin [in]) at 0.8 g/liter, beneo synergy 1 (enriched oligofructose and inulin [of-in]) at 4 g/liter, and a combination of vivinal gos 15 (7.2 g/liter) and beneo hp (0.8 g/liter) (gos-in).  the growth of total bacteria, bifidobacterium, bacteroides, bifidobacterium longum, and escherichia coli was quantified using specific quantitative pcr (qpcr). bifidobacterium was also enumerated on selective beerens agar plates, with representative colonies identified by sequencing of their 16s rrna genes. volatile fatty acids (vfa) and ph in the cultures were also determined. irrespective of the feeding methods, the gos product, either alone or in combination with beneo hp, resulted in substantially higher growth of total bifidobacteria, and much of this growth was attributed to growth of b. longum. beneo synergy 1 also increased the abundance of total bifidobacteria and b. longum. corresponding to the increases in these two bacterial groups, acetic acid concentrations were higher, while there was a trend of lower e. coli levels and ph. the lower ph and higher acetic acid concentration might be directly responsible for the lower e. coli population. at the concentrations studied, the  gos product was more bifidogenic and potent in inhibiting e. coli than the other  products tested. these results suggest that supplementation of infant formula with gos may increase intestinal bifidobacteria and benefit infant health.

TI  == effect of kcl substitution on bacterial viability of escherichia coli (atcc 25922) and selected probiotics.
AB  == excessive intake of nacl has been associated with the increased risk of several diseases, particularly hypertension. strategies to reduce sodium intake include substitution of nacl with other salts, such as kcl. in this study, the effects of nacl reduction and its substitution with kcl on cell membranes of a cheese starter bacterium (lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis), probiotic bacteria (bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei), and a pathogenic bacterium (escherichia coli) were investigated using fourier-transform infrared (ftir) spectroscopy. a critical nacl concentration that inhibited the viability of e. coli without affecting the viability of probiotic bacteria significantly was determined. to find the critical nacl concentration, de man, rogosa, and sharpe (mrs) broth was supplemented with a range of nacl concentrations [0 (control), 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0%], and the effect on cell viability and ftir spectra was monitored for all bacteria. a nacl concentration of 2.5% was found to be the critical level of nacl to inhibit e. coli without significantly affecting the viability of most of the probiotic bacteria and the cheese starter bacterium. the ftir spectral analysis also highlighted the changes that occurred mainly in the amide regions upon increasing the nacl concentration from 2.5 to 3.0% in most of  the bacteria. escherichia coli and b. longum were more sensitive to substitution  of nacl with kcl, compared with lb. acidophilus, lb. casei, and lc. lactis ssp. lactis. to evaluate the effect of substitution of nacl with kcl, substitution was carried out at the critical total salt concentration (2.5%, wt/vol) at varying concentrations (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% kcl). the findings suggest that 50% substitution of nacl with kcl, at 2.5% total salt, could inhibit e. coli without  affecting the probiotic bacteria.

TI  == functional analysis of bifidobacterial promoters in bifidobacterium longum and escherichia coli using the alpha-galactosidase gene as a reporter.
AB  == heterologous gene expression in bifidobacteria requires weak, strong, and inducible promoters depending on the objectives of different expression studies.  weak promoters in escherichia coli can also be desirable for stable heterologous  gene cloning. here, we developed a reporter system using the bifidobacterium longum alpha-galactosidase gene and investigated the activity and inducibility of seven bifidobacterial promoters in b. longum and their activities in e. coli. these studies revealed diverse promoter activities. three promoters were highly active in b. longum, but only slightly active in e. coli. among these, two phosphoketolase gene (xfp) promoters exhibited strong activity in b. longum cells grown on glucose. in contrast, the promoter activity of the fructose transporter  operon (fruekfg) was strongly induced by carbohydrates other than glucose, including fructose, xylose, and ribose. these promoters will allow strong or highly inducible expression in bifidobacteria and stable gene cloning in e. coli. in contrast to the functions of these promoters, the promoter of sucrose-utilization operon cscba showed very high activity in e. coli but low activity in b. longum. other three promoters were functional in both b. longum and e. coli. in particular, two sucrose phosphorylase gene (scrp) promoters showed inducible activity by sucrose and raffinose in b. longum, indicating their applicability for regulated expression studies. the diverse promoter functions revealed in this study will contribute to enabling the regulated expression of heterologous genes in bifidobacteria research.

TI  == influence of bovine lactoferrin on the growth of selected probiotic bacteria under aerobic conditions.
AB  == bovine lactoferrin (blf) is a natural glycoprotein, and it shows broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. however, reports on the influences of blf on probiotic bacteria have been mixed. we examined the effects of apo-blf (between 0.25 and 128 mg/ml) on both aerobic and anaerobic cultures of probiotics. we found that blf had similar effects on the growth of probiotics under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, and that it actively and significantly (at concentrations of >0.25 mg/ml) retarded the growth rate of bifidobacterium bifidum (atcc 29521), b. longum (atcc 15707), b. lactis (bcrc 17394), b. infantis (atcc 15697), lactobacillus reuteri (atcc 23272), l. rhamnosus (atcc 53103), and l. coryniformis (atcc 25602) in a dose-dependent manner. otherwise, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were 128 or >128 mg/ml against b. bifidum, b. longum, b. lactis, l. reuteri, and l. rhamnosus (atcc 53103). with regard to mics, blf showed at least four-fold lower inhibitory effect on probiotics than on pathogens. intriguingly, blf (>0.25 mg/ml) significantly enhanced the growth of rhamnosus (atcc 7469) and l. acidophilus (bcrc 14065) by approximately 40-200 %,  during their late periods of growth. supernatants produced from aerobic but not anaerobic cultures of l. acidophilus reduced the growth of escherichia coli by about 20 %. thus, blf displayed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the growth  of most probiotic strains under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. an antibacterial supernatant prepared from the aerobic cultures may have significant practical use.

TI  == bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum exo-beta-1,3-galactanase, an enzyme for the  degradation of type ii arabinogalactan.
AB  == type ii arabinogalactan (ag-ii) is a suitable carbohydrate source for bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, but the degradative enzymes have never been characterized. in this study, we characterized an exo-beta-1,3-galactanase, bllj_1840, belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 43 from b. longum subsp. longum jcm1217. the recombinant bllj_1840 expressed in escherichia coli hydrolyzed beta-1,3-linked galactooligosaccharides but not beta-1,4- and beta-1,6-linked galactooligosaccharides. the enzyme also hydrolyzed larch wood arabinogalactan (lwag), which comprises a beta-1,3-linked galactan backbone with  beta-1,6-linked galactan side chains. the kcat/km ratio of dearabinosylated lwag  was 24-fold higher than that of beta-1,3-galactan. bllj_1840 is a novel type of exo-beta-1,3-galactanase with a higher affinity for the beta-1,6-substituted beta-1,3-galactan than for nonsubstituted beta-1,3-galactan. bllj_1840 has 27% to 28% identities with other characterized exo--1,3-galactanases from bacteria and fungi. the homologous genes are conserved in several strains of b. longum subsp.  longum and b. longum subsp. infantis but not in other bifidobacteria. transcriptional analysis revealed that bllj_1840 is intensively induced with bllj_1841, an endo-beta-1,6-galactanase candidate, in the presence of lwag. this  is the first report of exo-beta-1,3-galactanase in bifidobacteria, which is an enzyme used for the acquisition of ag-ii in b. longum subsp. longum.

TI  == bifidobacteria exhibit luxs-dependent autoinducer 2 activity and biofilm formation.
AB  == autoinducer-2 (ai-2) molecules are one class of signalling molecules involved in  gene regulation dependent on population density in a mechanism commonly referred  to as quorum sensing (qs). ai-2 is produced by the methylthioadenosine/s-adenosyl-homocysteine nucleosidase luxs. in the present study, we characterise the function of bifidobacterial luxs proteins to address the question whether these economically important bacteria are able to perform qs communication. all publically available genome sequences of bifidobacteria harbour putative luxs genes. the deduced amino acid sequences are well conserved  in the genus and show good homology to the luxs protein of the prototypical ai-2  producer vibrio harveyi. the luxs genes of three bifidobacterial strains were successfully expressed in ai-2-negative escherichia coli dh5alpha. supernatants of these recombinant e. coli strains contained significant ai-2 activity. in initial experiments, we failed to detect ai-2 activity in supernatants of bifidobacteria grown in mrsc. high concentration of glucose as well as acidic ph  had strong inhibitory effects on ai-2 activity. ai-2 activity could be detected when lower volumes of supernatants were used in the assay. homologous overexpression of luxs in bifidobacterium longum ncc2705 increased ai-2 levels in the supernatant. furthermore, over-expression of luxs or supplementation with ai-2-containing supernatants enhanced biofilm formation of b. longum ncc2705. collectively, these results suggest that bifidobacteria indeed harbour functional luxs genes that are involved in the production of ai-2-like molecules. to the best of our knowledge, this represents the first report on ai-2 activity produced by bifidobacteria. self-produced ai-2 activity as well as ai-2-like molecules of  other bacteria of the intestinal tract may have a regulatory function in biofilm  formation and host colonization by bifidobacteria.

AB  == the gnb/lnb (galacto-n-biose/lacto-n-biose) pathway plays a crucial role in bifidobacteria during growth on human milk or mucin from epithelial cells. it is  thought to be the major route for galactose utilization in bifidobacterium longum as it is an energy-saving variant of the leloir pathway. both pathways are present in b. bifidum, and galactose 1-phosphate (gal1p) is considered to play a  key role. due to its toxic nature, gal1p is further converted into its activated  udp-sugar through the action of poorly characterized uridylyltransferases. in this study, three uridylyltransferases (galt1, galt2, and ugpa) from bifidobacterium bifidum were cloned in an escherichia coli mutant and screened for activity on the key intermediate gal1p. galt1 and galt2 showed udp-glucose-hexose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase activity (ec 2.7.7.12), whereas ugpa showed promiscuous utp-hexose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase activity (ec 2.7.7.10). the activity of ugpa toward glucose 1-phosphate was about 33-fold higher than that toward gal1p. galt1, as part of the bifidobacterial leloir pathway, was about 357-fold more active than galt2, the functional analog  in the gnb/lnb pathway. these results suggest that galt1 plays a more significant role than previously thought and predominates when b. bifidum grows on lactose and human milk oligosaccharides. galt2 activity is required only during growth on substrates with a gnb core such as mucin glycans.

TI  == utilization of major fucosylated and sialylated human milk oligosaccharides by isolated human gut microbes.
AB  == human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) are not digested in the proximal intestine. in distal intestine, hmos collectively modify the microbiota, but the response of individual bacteria to individual components of the hmos is not well defined. here, each of 25 major isolates of the human intestinal microbiota was fed individual major fucosylated and sialylated hmos in anaerobic culture. this allowed for an assessment of the influence of specific hmos on the growth and metabolic products of individual microbiota bacteria. most bifidobacteria spp. and bacteroides spp. grew, induced alpha-l-fucosidase activity, and produced abundant lactate or short-chain fatty acids (scfas) when fed 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-fl), 3-fl, and lactodifucotetraose (ldft). lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc7830, enterococcus faecalis atcc19433, and streptococcus thermophilus atcc19258 exhibited slight growth, ph reduction, and lactate production when supplemented with 2'-fl or 3-fl, but not ldft. supplementation with 3'-sialyllactose (3'-sl) and 6'-sl promoted moderate growth of bifidobacterium longum jcm7007, 7009, 7010, 7011, 1272, 11347, atcc15708, bacteroides vulgatus atcc8482, and b. thetaiotaomicron atcc29148; accordingly, these bacteria exhibited greater neuraminidase activity and produced copious lactate, scfa, or both. lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc7830 also consumed 6'-sl. in contrast, clostridium spp., l. rhamnosus atcc53103, e. faecalis atcc29200, staphylococcus spp., enterobacter spp., and escherichia coli k12 did not consume milk oligosaccharides nor produce appreciable acidic fermentation products. specific bifidobacteria and bacteroides differentially digest specific individual hmos, with the major fucosylated milk oligosaccharides most strongly stimulating key species of mutualist symbionts. this suggests strategies for treating dysbiosis of the microbiota and associated inflammatory disorders.

TI  == probiotics improve survival of septic rats by suppressing conditioned pathogens in ascites.
AB  == aim: to investigate the benefits of probiotics treatment in septic rats. methods: the septic rats were induced by cecal ligation and puncture. the animals of control, septic model and probiotics treated groups were treated with vehicle and mixed probiotics, respectively. the mixture of probiotics included bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus.  we observed the survival of septic rats using different amounts of mixed probiotics. we also detected the bacterial population in ascites and blood of experimental sepsis using cultivation and real-time polymerase chain reaction. the severity of mucosal inflammation in colonic tissues was determined. results:  probiotics treatment improved survival of the rats significantly and this effect  was dose dependent. the survival rate was 30% for vehicle-treated septic model group. however, 1 and 1/4 doses of probiotics treatment increased survival rate significantly compared with septic model group (80% and 55% vs 30%, p < 0.05). the total viable counts of bacteria in ascites decreased significantly in probiotics treated group compared with septic model group (5.20 +/- 0.57 vs 9.81  +/- 0.67, p < 0.05). the total positive rate of hemoculture decreased significantly in probiotics treated group compared with septic model group (33.3% vs 100.0%, p < 0.05). the population of escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus in ascites of probiotics treated group were decreased significantly compared with that of septic model group (3.93 +/- 0.73 vs 8.80 +/- 0.83, p < 0.05; 2.80 +/- 1.04 vs 5.39 +/- 1.21, p < 0.05). with probiotics treatment, there was a decrease in the scores of inflammatory cell infiltration into the intestinal mucosa in septic animals (1.50 +/- 0.25 vs 2.88 +/- 0.14, p < 0.01). conclusion: escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus may be primary pathogens in septic rats. probiotics improve survival of septic rats by suppressing these conditioned pathogens.

TI  == immunoregulatory effect of bifidobacteria strains in porcine intestinal epithelial cells through modulation of ubiquitin-editing enzyme a20 expression.
AB  == background: we previously showed that evaluation of anti-inflammatory activities  of lactic acid bacteria in porcine intestinal epithelial (pie) cells is useful for selecting potentially immunobiotic strains. objective: the aims of the present study were: i) to select potentially immunomodulatory bifidobacteria that beneficially modulate the toll-like receptor (tlr)-4-triggered inflammatory response in pie cells and; ii) to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in the anti-inflammatory effect of immunobiotics by evaluating the role  of tlr2 and tlr negative regulators in the modulation of proinflammatory cytokine production and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) and nuclear  factor-kappab (nf-kappab) pathways in pie cells. results: bifidobacteria longum bb536 and b. breve m-16v strains significantly downregulated levels of interleukin (il)-8, monocyte chemotactic protein (mcp)-1 and il-6 in pie cells challenged with heat-killed enterotoxigenic escherichia coli. moreover, bb536 and m-16v strains attenuated the proinflammatory response by modulating the nf-kappab and mapk pathways. in addition, our findings provide evidence for a key role for  the ubiquitin-editing enzyme a20 in the anti-inflammatory effect of immunobiotic  bifidobacteria in pie cells. conclusions: we show new data regarding the mechanism involved in the anti-inflammatory effect of immunobiotics. several strains with immunoregulatory capabilities used a common mechanism to induce tolerance in pie cells. immunoregulatory strains interacted with tlr2, upregulated the expression of a20 in pie cells, and beneficially modulated the subsequent tlr4 activation by reducing the activation of mapk and nf-kappab pathways and the production of proinflammatory cytokines. we also show that the combination of tlr2 activation and a20 induction can be used as biomarkers to screen and select potential immunoregulatory bifidobacteria strains.

TI  == crystal structure of a type ii dehydroquinate dehydratase-like protein from bifidobacterium longum.
AB  == dehydroquinate dehydratase (dhqd) catalyzes the third step in the biosynthetic shikimate pathway. here we identify a bifidobacterium longum protein with high sequence homology to type ii dhqds but no detectable dhqd activity under standard assay conditions. a crystal structure reveals that the b. longum protein adopts a dhqd-like tertiary structure but a distinct quaternary state. apparently forming  a dimer, the b. longum protein lacks the active site aspartic acid contributed from a neighboring protomer in the type ii dhqd dodecamer. relating to the absence of protein-protein interactions established in the type ii dhqd dodecameric assembly, substantial conformational changes distinguish the would-be active site of the b. longum protein. as b. longum possess no other genes with homology to known dhqds, these findings imply a unique dhqd activity within b. longum.

TI  == efficacy of different probiotic combinations on death and necrotizing enterocolitis in a premature rat model.
AB  == objective: the aim of the present study was to investigate the most effective probiotic combinations to prevent death and necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) in a  premature rat model. methods: one hundred fifty-eight premature sprague-dawley premature rats were enrolled. probiotic strains bifidobacterium bifidum, b longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, l plantarum, and b breve were fed as a single  strain or mixture with 2 or 3 strains for a total of 9 study groups; control groups received no exogenous probiotic supplement. fecal samples were collected for 72 hours to detect probiotic strains and pathologic strains by real-time polymerase chain reaction. colony counts of probiotic strains escherichia coli and klebsiella were compared between groups before and after 36 hours of the study period. the incidence of death and nec were compared via fisher exact test  between groups. results: the results demonstrated that l plantarum alone (p = 0.0026) and b bifidum with b longum together (p = 0.0017) were more effective in  reducing nec as compared with the control group. all of the study groups except b breve and b bifidum with b breve definitely prevented death compared with controls. b bifidum and b longum together had significantly lower mortality than  the control group (p < 0.0001). colony counts of e coli and klebsiella in stool samples were significantly decreased in the b bifidum, b longum, and l plantarum  group compared with the other study and control groups after 36 hours. conclusions: administration of a mixture of probiotic strains with b bifidum and  b longum was most effective in preventing death and nec in this animal model, and these observations provide an evidence-based strategy for designing further neonatal clinical trials.

TI  == effects of antibiotics on bacterial species composition and metabolic activities  in chemostats containing defined populations of human gut microorganisms.
AB  == the composition and metabolic activities of the human colonic microbiota are modulated by a number of external factors, including diet and antibiotic therapy. changes in the structure and metabolism of the gut microbiota may have long-term  consequences for host health. the large intestine harbors a complex microbial ecosystem comprising several hundreds of different bacterial species, which complicates investigations on intestinal physiology and ecology. to facilitate such studies, a highly simplified microbiota consisting of 14 anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic organisms (bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, clostridium butyricum, c. perfringens, c. bifermentans, c. innocuum, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus) was used in this investigation. ampicillin [9.2 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to two chemostats  operated at different dilution rates (d; 0.10 h(-1) and 0.21 h(-1)), and metronidazole [76.9 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to a third vessel (d = 0.21 h(-1)). perturbations in bacterial physiology and metabolism were sampled over a  48-h period. lactobacillus acidophilus and c. bifermentans populations did not establish in the fermentors under the imposed growth conditions. ampicillin resulted in substantial reductions in bacteroides and c. perfringens populations  at both dilution rates. metronidazole strongly affected bacteroides communities but had no effect on bifidobacterial communities. the bacteriostatic effect of ampicillin on bifidobacterial species was growth rate dependent. several metabolic activities were affected by antibiotic addition, including fermentation product formation and enzyme synthesis. the growth of antibiotic-resistant bifidobacteria in the large bowel may enable them to occupy ecological niches left vacant after antibiotic administration, preventing colonization by pathogenic species.

TI  == development of antimicrobial synbiotics using potentially-probiotic faecal isolates of lactobacillus fermentum and bifidobacterium longum.
AB  == the aims of the present study were to investigate in vitro the antimicrobial activity of lactobacillus fermentum and bifidobacterium longum, isolated from faeces of healthy elderly individuals, against enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli (e. coli o157:h7) and enteropathogenic e. coli (e. coli o86), to determine the capability of the selected strains to tolerate acid and bile in vitro, to select suitable carbohydrates in order to enhance the growth and maximise antimicrobial activity of the putative probiotic organisms and examine the adhesion properties of the synbiotics. antimicrobial activity of the putative probiotics and synbiotics was investigated by a microtitre method using cell-free culture supernatants (cfcs). results of the antimicrobial assay showed that both  putative probiotic strains produced compounds at ph 5 that lead to higher lag phases of both e. coli o157:h7 and e. coli o86. when half the quantity of cell-free culture supernatants of both probiotic strains was used at ph 5, b. longum maintained the same antimicrobial effect against both strains of e. coli,  whereas l. fermentum lead to a higher lag phase of e. coli o86 only. neutralization of the culture supernatants with alkali reduced the antimicrobial  effect with only cell-free supernatant of l. fermentum causing lower maximum growth rates of e. coli o157:h7 and e. coli o86. l. fermentum appeared to be acid tolerant whereas b. longum was more susceptible to acid and both isolates were bile tolerant. a short chain fructooligosaccharide (scfos) and an isomalto-oligosaccharide (imo) proved to be the most effective substrates, enhancing antimicrobial activity for l. fermentum and b. longum respectively. the adhesion of the synbiotic combinations showed that l. fermentum, exhibited higher percentage of adhesion when grown on glucose and as a synbiotic combination with  scfos whereas b. longum exhibited lowest percentage of adhesion when grown on both glucose and imo.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == the pyre gene as a bidirectional selection marker in bifidobacterium longum 105-a.
AB  == we constructed a deletion mutant of the pyre gene in bifidobacterium longum 105-a. a pyre knockout cassette was cloned into pkkt427, a bifidobacterium-escherichia coli shuttle vector, and then introduced into b. longum 105-a by electroporation. the transformants were propagated and spread onto mrs plates containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-foa) and uracil. 5-foa-resistant mutants were obtained at a frequency of 4.7 x 10(-5) integrations per cell. to perform pyre gene complementation, the pyre gene was amplified by pcr and used to construct a complementation plasmid (pkkt427-pyre (+)). b. longum 105-a pyre harboring this plasmid could not grow on mrs plates containing 5-foa,  uracil and spectinomycin. we also developed a chemically defined medium (bifidobacterial minimal medium; bmm) containing inorganic salts, glucose, vitamins, isoleucine and tyrosine for positive selection of pyre transformants. b. longum 105-a pyre could not grow on bmm agar, but the same strain harboring pkkt427-pyre (+) could. thus, pyre can be used as a counterselection marker in b. longum 105-a and potentially other bifidobacterium species as well. we demonstrated the effectiveness of this system by constructing a knockout mutant of the xynf gene in b. longum 105-a by using the pyre gene as a counterselection  marker. this pyre-based selection system will contribute to genetic studies of bifidobacteria.

TI  == developing an efficient and reproducible conjugation-based gene transfer system for bifidobacteria.
AB  == bifidobacteria are widely used as probiotics and have attracted increasing research interest worldwide. however, molecular techniques are still very scarce  mainly due to the low efficiencies and strain-specific electroporation protocols  that have been developed. bacterial conjugation enables the transfer of genetic material among a relatively wide range of organisms and with virtually no size limitation. a conjugation protocol was developed based on the rp4 conjugative machinery in the escherichia coli strain wm3064(pbb109). using this machinery, the newly constructed transmissible e. coli-bifidobacterium shuttle vector, pdojhr-wd2, was successfully and consistently transferred into several strains representing four bifidobacterium species at efficiencies which correlated with the e. coli to bifidobacteria ratios. higher ratios were found to significantly improve transfer frequency per recipient, with almost 100 % transfer frequency occurring when the ratio was 10(5) : 1. the incompatible resident plasmid, pdojh10s, in bifidobacterium longum djo10a was able to coexist, albeit at lower copy numbers, with the incoming vector pdojhr-wd2 even though they possess the same ori. in some cases the copy number of this resident plasmid was too low to observe via gel electrophoresis, but it could be detected by southern hybridization. plasmid curing resulted in a strain, djo10a-w3, that had lost both plasmids and this showed a one-log increase in conjugation efficiency due to the  lack of plasmid incompatibility. in conclusion, this novel conjugative gene transfer protocol can be used for the introduction of genetic material (without size restriction) into bifdobacterium species and is particularly useful for strains that are recalcitrant to electroporation.

TI  == bifidobacterial alpha-galactosidase with unique carbohydrate-binding module specifically acts on blood group b antigen.
AB  == bifidobacterium bifidum is one of the most frequently found bifidobacteria in the intestines of newborn infants. we previously reported that b. bifidum possesses unique metabolic pathways for o-linked glycans on gastrointestinal mucin (yoshida e, sakurama h, kiyohara m, nakajima m, kitaoka m, ashida h, hirose j, katayama t, yamamoto k, kumagai h. 2012. bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis uses two different beta-galactosidases for selectively degrading type-1 and type-2 human milk oligosaccharides. glycobiology. 22:361-368). the nonreducing termini of o-linked glycans on mucin are frequently covered with histo-blood group antigens. here, we identified a gene agabb from b. bifidum jcm 1254, which encodes glycoside hydrolase (gh) family 110 alpha-galactosidase. agabb is a 1289-amino acid polypeptide containing an n-terminal signal sequence, a gh110 domain, a carbohydrate-binding module (cbm) 51 domain, a bacterial ig-like (big) 2 domain and a c-terminal transmembrane region, in this order. the recombinant enzyme expressed in escherichia coli hydrolyzed alpha1,3-linked gal in branched blood group b antigen [galalpha1-3(fucalpha1-2)galbeta1-r], but not in a linear xenotransplantation antigen (galalpha1-3galbeta1-r). the enzyme also acted on group b human salivary mucin and erythrocytes. we also revealed that cbm51 specifically bound blood group b antigen using both isothermal titration calorimetry and a solid-phase binding assay, and it enhanced the affinity of the  enzyme toward substrates with multivalent b antigens. we suggest that this enzyme plays an important role in degrading b antigens to acquire nutrients from mucin oligosaccharides in the gastrointestinal tracts.

TI  == the principal fucosylated oligosaccharides of human milk exhibit prebiotic properties on cultured infant microbiota.
AB  == breast-fed infant microbiota is typically rich in bifidobacteria. herein, major human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) are assessed for their ability to promote the  growth of bifidobacteria and to acidify their environment, key features of prebiotics. during in vitro anaerobic fermentation of infant microbiota, supplementation by hmos significantly decreased the ph even greater than supplementation by fructooligosaccharide (fos), a prebiotic positive control. hmos elevated lactate concentrations, increased the proportion of bifidobacterium spp. in culture, and through their fermentation into organic acids, decreased the proportion of escherichia and clostridium perfringens. three principal components of hmos, 2'-fucosyllactose, lactodifucotetraose and 3-fucosyllactose, were consumed in these cultures. these three principal oligosaccharides of human milk  were then individually tested as supplements for in vitro growth of four individual representative strains of infant gut microbes. bifidobacterium longum  jcm7007 and b. longum atcc15697 efficiently consumed oligosaccharides and produced abundant lactate and short-chain fatty acids, resulting in significant ph reduction. the specificity of fermentation differed by microbe species and strain and by oligosaccharide structure. escherichia coli k12 and c. perfringens  did not utilize appreciable fucosylated oligosaccharides, and a typical mixture of organic acid fermentation products inhibited their growth. in summary, 2'-fucosyllactose, lactodifucotetraose, and 3-fucosyllactose, when cultured with  b. longum jcm7007 and b. longum atcc15697, exhibit key characteristics of a prebiotic in vitro. if these bifidobacteria are representative of pioneering or keystone species for human microbiota, fucosylated hmos could strongly promote colonization and maintenance of a mutualist symbiotic microbiome. thus, these simple glycans could mediate beneficial effects of human milk on infant health.

AB  == different ways of treating bran by baking enzymes prior to dough making and the baking process were used to increase the amount of water-soluble dietary fiber (df) in wheat bread with added bran. soluble df was extracted from the bread with water and separated from the digestible material with gastrointestinal tract enzymes and by solvent precipitation. the baking enzyme mixtures tested (xylanase and glucanase/cellulase, with and without lipase) increased the amounts of soluble arabinoxylan and protein resistant to digestion. the isolated fiber was used as a growth substrate for 11 probiotic and intestinal bifidobacterium strains, for commensal strains of bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli, and  for potential intestinal pathogenic strains of e. coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, and clostridium perfringens. fermentation analyses indicated that the tested strains had varying capacity to grow in the presence of the extracted  fiber. of the tested probiotic strains b. longum species generally showed the highest ability to utilize the fiber extracts, although the potential pathogens tested also showed an ability to grow on these fiber extracts. in sum, the enzymes used to improve the baking process for high-fiber bread can also be used  to produce in situ soluble fiber material, which in turn can exert prebiotic effects on certain potentially beneficial microbes.

AB  == bifidobacteria are the main component of the human microflora. we constructed a temperature-sensitive (ts) plasmid by random mutagenesis of the bifidobacterium-escherichia coli shuttle vector pkkt427 using error-prone pcr. mutant plasmids were introduced into bifidobacterium longum 105-a and, after screening approximately 3,000 colonies, candidate clones that grew at 30 degrees  c but not at 42 degrees c were selected. according to dna sequence analysis of the ts plasmid, five silent and one missense mutations were found in the repb region. the site-directed mutagenesis showed only the missense mutation to be relevant to the ts phenotype. we designated this plasmid pko403. the ts phenotype was also observed in b. longum ncc2705 and bifidobacterium adolescentis atcc15703. single-crossover homologous-recombination experiments were carried out to determine the relationship between the length of homologous sequences encoded  on the plasmid and recombination frequency: fragments greater than 1 kb gave an efficiency of more than 10(3) integrations per cell. we performed gene knockout experiments using this ts plasmid. we obtained gene knockout mutants of the pyre  region of b. longum 105-a, and determined that double-crossover homologous recombination occurred at an efficiency of 1.8 %. this knockout method also worked for the bl0033 gene in b. longum ncc2705.

AB  == to understand the role of intestinal microflora in expressing the pharmacological effect of ginsenoside rb1, the metabolic activity of ginsenoside rb1 by 148 fecal specimens was measured and its metabolizing beta-glucosidase was cloned. the average activities for p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside and ginsenoside rb1 were 0.097+/-0.059 mumol/min/mg and 0.311+/-0.118 pmol/min/mg, respectively. these enzyme activities were not different between male and female, or between ages. a gene encoding beta-d-glucosidase (bglx) was cloned from bifidobacterium longum h-1, which transformed ginsenoside rb1 to compound k. the probe for cloning was synthesized from the genes encoding a beta-d-glucosidase of previously reported b. longum djo10a. the sequences of the cloned gene revealed 2364 bp open reading frame (orf) encoding a protein containing 787 amino acids (molecular weight of 95 kda). the gene exhibited 99% homology (identities) to that of b. longum. the cloned gene was expressed under t7 promoter of the expression vector, pet-39b(+), in escherichia coli bl21(de3), and the expressed enzyme was purified by using hitrap immobilized metal affinity chromatography (imac) hp. the enzyme potently biotransformed ginsenoside rb1, loganin, arctiin and arbutin to ginsenoside rd, loganetin, arctigenin and hydroquinone, respectively, but was not active in the case of hesperidin, and kakkalide. this is the first report on cloning and expression of beta-d-glucosidase from b. longum. based on these findings, ginsenoside rb1 may be metabolized to bioactive  compound(s) by exo-beta-d-glucosidase(s) produced from the intestinal bacteria and its pharmacological effects may be dependent on intestinal bacterial exo-beta-d-glucosidase(s) activity.

AB  == the immunomodulatory effects of probiotics were assessed following exposure of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc), cord blood cells and the spleen-derived monocyte/macrophage cell line crl-9850 to lactobacillus acidophilus lavri-a1, lb. rhamnosus gg, exopolysaccharides (eps)-producing streptococcus thermophilus st1275, bifidobacteriun longum bl536, b. lactis b94 and escherichia coli tg1 strains. the production of a panel of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines by pbmc following bacterial stimulation was measured, using live, heat-killed or mock gastrointestinal tract (git)-exposed bacteria, and results show that (i) all bacterial strains investigated induced significant  secretion of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines from pbmc-derived monocytes/macrophages; and (ii) cytokine levels increased relative to the expansion of bacterial cell numbers over time for cells exposed to live cultures. bifidobacteria and s. thermophilus stimulated significant concentrations of transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta, an interleukin necessary for the differentiation of regulatory t cells (t(reg) )/t helper type 17 (th17) cells and, as such, the study further examined the induction of th17 and t(reg) cells after pbmc exposure to selected bacteria for 96 h. data show a significant increase in the numbers of both cell types in the exposed populations, measured by cell surface marker expression and by cytokine production. probiotics have been shown to induce cytokines from a range of immune cells following ingestion of these organisms. these studies suggest that probiotics' interaction with immune-competent cells produces a cytokine milieu, exerting immunomodulatory effects on local effector cells, as well as potently inducing differentiation of  th17 and t(reg) cells.

TI  == preoperative probiotics decrease postoperative infectious complications of colorectal cancer.
AB  == background: the objective is to elucidate the effects of oral bifid triple viable probiotics among patients with colorectal cancer. methods: sixty patients undergoing radical colorectal resection were randomly assigned to 3-day (days -5  to -3) preoperative probiotics (group a, n = 30) or placebo (group b, n = 30) treatment. the alteration of intestinal flora was evaluated by fecal cultures of  escherichia coli, bifidobacterium longum and intestinal fungi; the gut barrier function by serum endotoxins and d-lactic acids and the immune and stress responses by peripheral blood immunoglobins, interleukin-6 and c-reactive protein. postoperative infections were documented physically, radiologically and  microbiologically. results: inverted bifidobacterium/escherichia ratios were preoperatively and postoperatively present in group b (both p < 0.05). bifidobacterium counts increased significantly, whereas escherichia counts decreased significantly on postoperative days 3 to 5 (p < 0.05), along with reversing the bifidobacterium/escherichia ratio inversion until postoperative days 3 to 5 in group a. group a also had lower levels of endotoxins, d-lactic acids, serum interleukin-6 and c-reactive protein but higher levels of serum igg  and siga (all p < 0.05) than group b. the incidences of postoperative infectious  complications were 3.3% to 6.7% and 3.3% to 30% in groups a and b (overall, 10.0% versus 33.3%, p < 0.05), respectively. conclusion: the preoperative oral bifid triple viable probiotics minimize the postoperative occurrence of infectious complications, with possible mechanisms attributed to the maintenance of the intestinal flora and restriction of bacterial translocation from the intestine. it was representative of the enhancement of systemic/localized immunity and concurrent attenuation of systemic stress response.

TI  == cloning and characterization of alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase and bifunctional alpha-l-arabinopyranosidase/beta-d-galactopyranosidase from bifidobacterium longum h-1.
AB  == aims: this study focused on the cloning, expression and characterization of recombinant alpha-l-arabinosidases from bifidobacterium longum h-1. methods and results: alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase (afub-h1) and bifunctional alpha-l-arabinopyranosidase/beta-d-galactosidase (apy-h1) from b. longum h-1 were identified by southern blotting, and their recombinant enzymes were overexpressed in escherichia coli bl21 (de3). recombinant afub-h1 (rafub-h1) was purified by single-step ni(2+) -affinity column chromatography, whereas recombinant apy-h1 (rapy-h1) was purified by serial q-hp and ni(2+) -affinity column chromatography. enzymatic properties and substrate specificities of the two enzymes were assessed, and their kinetic constants were calculated. according to the results,  rafub-h1 hydrolysed p-nitrophenyl-alpha-l-arabinofuranoside (pnp-alphal-af) and ginsenoside rc, but did not hydrolyse p-nitrophenyl-alpha-l-arabinopyranoside (pnp-alphal-ap). on the other hand, rapy-h1 hydrolysed pnp-alphal-ap, p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside (pnp-betad-ga) and ginsenoside rb2. conclusions: ginsenoside-metabolizing bifidobacterial rafub-h1 and rapy-h1 were successfully cloned, expressed, and characterized. rafub-h1 specifically recognized the alpha-l-arabinofuranoside, whereas rapy-h1 had dual functions, that is, it could hydrolyse both beta-d-galactopyranoside and alpha-l-arabinopyranoside. significance and impact of the study: these findings suggest that the biochemical properties and substrate specificities of these recombinant enzymes differ from those of previously identified alpha-l-arabinosidases from bifidobacterium breve k-110 and clostridium cellulovorans.

TI  == substrate promiscuity of n-acetylhexosamine 1-kinases.
AB  == n-acetylhexosamine 1-kinase (nahk) catalyzes the direct addition of a phosphate from adenosine 5'-triphosphate (atp) to the anomeric position of n-acetylhexosamine and shows similar activity towards n-acetylglucosamine (glcnac) and n-acetylgalactosamine (galnac). herein we report the cloning, characterization, and substrate specificity studies of two nahks from bifidobacterium infantis atcc15697 and bifidobacterium longum atcc55813, respectively. a new capillary electrophoresis assay method has been developed for enzyme activity assays. both enzymes have a good expression level in e. coli (180-185 mg/l culture) and can tolerate diverse modifications at c2 of glcnac and galnac. various glcnac derivatives with c6, both c2 and c6, as well as both c2 and c3 modifications are tolerable substrates for the newly cloned nahks. quite interestingly, despite of their low activities toward glucose and galactose, the  activities of both nahks are much higher for mannose and some of its c2, c4, and  c6 derivatives. these nahks are excellent catalysts for enzymatic and chemoenzymatic synthesis of carbohydrates.

TI  == temporal variations in early gut microbial colonization are associated with allergen-specific immunoglobulin e but not atopic eczema at 2 years of age.
AB  == background: intestinal microbiota undergoes substantial development during the first 2 years of life, important for intestinal immunologic development and maturation influencing systemic immune responses. objective: we aimed to investigate, using a prospective study design, whether allergen-specific ige (sige) and atopic eczema are associated with variations in gut microbial colonization patterns in an unselected population during the first 2 years of life. methods: faeces from 94 infants were repeatedly sampled from 10 days, 4 months, 1 and 2 years postnatal and analysed for 12 different bacterial species by quantitative real-time pcr. venous blood samples from the infants were collected at 2 years of age and were analysed for sige for 12 specific allergens. the temporal gut colonization patterns for 42 sige-positive (sige>/=0.35 ku/l) and 52 sige-negative children (sige<0.1 ku/l) were then compared. the association between colonization pattern and phenotype as atopic eczema according to uk working party (ukwp) criteria were also described. results: subjects with atopic  sensitization had lower levels of escherichia coli at 4 months and 1 year, higher levels of bifidobacterium longum at 1 year and lower levels of bacteroides fragilis at 2 years. for e. coli and b. longum, the differences were only transient and had disappeared by 2 years of age. for other species, there were no differences in colonization patterns, and we found no association between colonization pattern and atopic eczema. conclusions and clinical relevance: we found temporal and transient variations in gut microbial colonization patterns associated with differences in sige sensitization at 2 years of age. a full understanding of the principles and mechanisms that underlie intestinal microbial colonization and diversity and host-microbiota relationships will be pivotal for  the development of therapeutic approaches that manipulate the intestinal microbiota to maintain human health.

TI  == faecal bifidobacteria in indian neonates & the effect of asymptomatic rotavirus infection during the first month of life.
AB  == background and objectives: bifidobacteria colonize the gut after the first week of life and remain an important component of the gut microbiota in infancy. this  study was carried out to characterize the diversity and number of bifidobacteria  colonizing the gut in indian neonates and to investigate whether asymptomatic infection with rotavirus in the first month of life affected gut colonization by  bifidobacteria. methods: dna was isolated from faeces of 14 term-born neonates who were under surveillance for rotavirus infection. bacterial and bifidobacterial diversity was evaluated by temporal temperature gradient electrophoresis (ttge) of 16s rdna amplified using total bacteria and bifidobacteria-specific primers. real time pcr, targeting 16s rdna, was used to quantitate faecal bifidobacteria and enterobacteria. results: ttge of conserved bacterial 16s rdna showed 3 dominant bands of which escherichia coli (family enterobacteriaceae) and bifidobacterium (family bifidobacteriaceae) were constant. ttge of bifidobacterium genus-specific dna showed a single band in all  neonates identified by sequencing as bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis. faecal bifidobacterial counts (log 10 cfu/g faeces) ranged from 6.1 to 9.3 and enterobacterial counts from 6.3 to 9.5. neonates without and with rotavirus infection in the first week of life did not show significant differences in the median count of bifidobacteria (log 10 count 7.48 vs. 7.41) or enterobacteria (log 10 count 8.79 vs. 7.92). interpretation and conclusions: b. longum subsp. infantis was the sole bifidobacterial species colonizing the gut of indian neonates. asymptomatic rotavirus infection in the first month of life was not associated with alteration in faecal bifidobacteria or enterobacteria.

TI  == dynamic omics approach identifies nutrition-mediated microbial interactions.
AB  == "omics" studies reported to date have dealt with either thoroughly characterized  single species or poorly explored meta-microbial communities. however, these techniques are capable of producing highly informative data for the analysis of interactions between two organisms. we examined the bacterial interaction between escherichia coli o157:h7 (o157) and bifidobacterium longum (bl) as a pathogenic-commensal bacterial model creating a minimum microbial ecosystem in the gut using dynamic omics approaches, consisting of improved time-lapse 2d-nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) metabolic profiling, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses. our study revealed that the minimum ecosystem was established by bacterial adaptation to the changes in the extracellular environment, primarily by o157, but not by bl. additionally, the relationship between bl and o157 could be partially regarded as that between a producer and a consumer of nutrients, respectively, especially with regard to serine and aspartate metabolism. taken together, our profiling system can provide a new insight into the primary metabolic dynamics in microbial ecosystems.

TI  == an exo-alpha-sialidase from bifidobacteria involved in the degradation of sialyloligosaccharides in human milk and intestinal glycoconjugates.
AB  == bifidobacteria are health-promoting enteric commensals that are assumed to proliferate predominantly in the intestines of breast-fed infants by assimilating human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) that are frequently fucosylated and/or sialylated. we previously identified two different alpha-l-fucosidases in bifidobacterium bifidum and showed that the strain furnishes an extracellular degradation pathway for fucosylated hmos. however, the catabolism of sialylated hmos by bifidobacteria has remained unresolved. here we describe the identification and characterization of an exo-alpha-sialidase in bifidobacteria.  by expression cloning, we isolated a novel exo-alpha-sialidase gene (siabb2) from b. bifidum jcm1254, which encodes a protein (siabb2) consisting of 835-amino-acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 87 kda. siabb2 possesses an n-terminal signal sequence, a sialidase catalytic domain classified into the glycoside hydrolase family 33 (gh33) and a c-terminal transmembrane region, indicating that the mature siabb2 is an extracellular membrane-anchored enzyme. the recombinant enzyme expressed in escherichia coli showed the highest activity  in an acidic ph range from 4.0 to 5.0, and at 50 degrees c. notably, 80% activity remained after 30 min incubation at 80 degrees c, indicating that the enzyme is highly thermostable. siabb2 liberated sialic acids from sialyloligosaccharides, gangliosides, glycoproteins and colominic acid; however, the linkage preference of the enzyme was remarkably biased toward the alpha2,3-linkage rather than alpha2,6- and alpha2,8-linkages. expression of siabb2 in b. longum 105-a, which has no endogenous exo-alpha-sialidase, enabled this strain to degrade sialyloligosaccharides present in human milk. our results suggest that siabb2 plays a crucial role in bifidobacterial catabolism of sialylated hmos.

TI  == immunomodulatory impact of a synbiotic in t(h)1 and t(h)2 models of infection.
AB  == background and methods: the immunomodulatory activity of a synbiotic combination  containing three bacterial strains (lactobacillus helveticus r0052, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis r0033 and bifidobacterium bifidum r0071) and short-chain fructooligosaccharide was examined in two distinct infectious rat models. in the t(h)1 model, wistar rats were administered the synbiotic combination for 2 weeks prior to challenge with a single oral dose of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli or vehicle. in the t(h)2 model, pretreated rats  were challenged with a single subcutaneous dose of hook worm, nippostrongylus brasiliensis. blood samples were collected 3 hours or 4 days postchallenge and serum levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were measured. results: significant reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (il)-1alpha, il-1beta, il-6, and tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha were observed in both models suggesting a single, unifying mode of action on an upstream regulator. the n. brasiliensis study also compared the effect of the individual strains to synbiotic. for most of cytokines the combination appeared to average the effect of the individual strains with the exception of il-4 and il-10 where there was apparent synergy for the combination. furthermore, the cytokine response varied by strain. conclusions: it was concluded that this synbiotic combination of these three microbes could be beneficial in both t(h)1 and t(h)2 diseases.

TI  == dietary glycosaminoglycans interfere in bacterial adhesion and gliadin-induced pro-inflammatory response in intestinal epithelial (caco-2) cells.
AB  == dietary components may have an important role in maintaining a balanced gut microbiota composition. celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy caused by gliadins, and has been associated with a reduced proportion of bifidobacterium in gut microbiota. this study evaluates the influence of glycosaminoglycans (gags) on bacterial adhesion and their contribution in the gliadins-induced inflammatory response. the adhesion of potential probiotic (bifidobacterium longum cect 7347 and bifidobacterium bifidum cect 7365), commensal (escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis) and pathogenic (salmonella enterica cect 443 and listeria monocytogenes cect 935) bacteria to mucin and caco-2 cell cultures was determined. gliadins were subjected to in vitro digestion (pepsin/pancreatin-bile), with/out gags, and the presence or not of cell suspensions of b. longum (10(8) cfu/ml). b. longum, e. coli, and l. monocytogenes, markedly interact with the high-sulphur-containing fraction of gags. the gags reduced the gliadins-mediated production of interleukin-1beta, but not tumour necrosis factor-alpha. the results suggest that gags may ameliorate gliadin-induced inflammatory response, though they also slightly interfere with the action of b. longum.

TI  == in vitro binding of mutagenic heterocyclic aromatic amines by bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum g4.
AB  == consumption of probiotics has been associated with decreased risk of colon cancer and reported to have antimutagenic/ anti-carcinogenic properties. one possible mechanism for this effect involves physical binding of the mutagenic compounds, such as heterocyclic amines (hcas), to the bacteria. therefore, the objective of  this study was to examine the binding capacity of bifidobacterial strains of human origin on mutagenic heterocyclic amines which are suspected to play a role  in human cancers. in vitro binding of the mutagens trp-p-2, iq, meiqx, 7,8dimeiqx and phip by three bacterial strains in two media of different ph was analysed using high performance liquid chromatography. bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum g4 showed the highest decrease in the total hcas content, followed by bifidobacterium longum, and escherichia coli. ph affects binding capacity; the highest binding was obtained at ph 6.8. gram-positive tested strains were found to be consistently more effective than the gram-negative strain. there were significant decreases in the amount of hcas in the presence of different cell concentrations of b. pseudocatenulatum g4; the highest decrease was detected at the concentration of 10(10) cfu/ml. the results showed that hcas were able to bind with all bacterial strains tested in vitro, thus it may be possible to decrease their absorption by human intestine and increase their elimination via faeces.

TI  == consumption of human milk oligosaccharides by gut-related microbes.
AB  == human milk contains large amounts of complex oligosaccharides that putatively modulate the intestinal microbiota of breast-fed infants by acting as decoy binding sites for pathogens and as prebiotics for enrichment of beneficial bacteria. several bifidobacterial species have been shown to grow well on human milk oligosaccharides. however, few data exist on other bacterial species. this work examined 16 bacterial strains belonging to 10 different genera for growth on human milk oligosaccharides. for this propose, a chemically defined medium, zmb1, was used, which allows vigorous growth of a number of gut-related microorganisms  in a fashion similar to complex media. interestingly, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, bacteroides fragilis , and bacteroides vulgatus strains were able to metabolize milk oligosaccharides with high efficiency, whereas enterococcus , streptococcus , veillonella , eubacterium , clostridium , and escherichia coli strains grew less well or not at all. mass spectrometry-based glycoprofiling of the oligosaccharide consumption behavior revealed a specific preference for fucosylated oligosaccharides by bi. longum subsp. infantis and ba. vulgatus. this work expands the current knowledge of human milk oligosaccharide consumption by gut microbes, revealing bacteroides as avid consumers of this substrate. these results provide insight on how human milk oligosaccharides shape the infant intestinal microbiota.

TI  == characterization of recombinant beta-fructofuranosidase from bifidobacterium adolescentis g1.
AB  == background: we have previously reported on purification and characterization of beta-fructofuranosidase (beta-ffase) from bifidobacterium adolescentis g1. this enzyme showed high activity of hydrolysis on fructo-oligosaccharides with a low degree of polymerization. recently, genome sequences of b. longum ncc2705 and b.  adolescentis atcc 15703 were determined, and csca gene in the both genome sequences encoding beta-ffase was predicted. here, cloning of csca gene encoding  putative beta-ffase from b. adolescentis g1, its expression in e. coli and properties of the recombinant protein are described. results: using the information of csca gene from bifidobacterium adolescentis atcc 15703, csca gene  from b. adolescentis g1 was cloned and sequenced. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of purified beta-ffase from b. adolescentis g1 was identical to the deduced amino acid sequences of csca gene from b. adolescentis g1. to confirm the translated product of the csca gene, the recombinant protein was expressed in escherichia coli. molecular mass of the purified recombinant enzyme was estimated to be about 66,000 by sds-page and 60,300 by maldi tof-ms. the optimum ph of the  enzyme was 5.7 and the enzyme was stable at ph 5.0-8.6. the thermostability of the enzyme was up to 50 degrees c. the k(m) (mm), vmax (micromol/mg of protein/min), k0 (sec(-1)) and k0/k(m)(mm(-1) sec(-1)) for 1-kestose, neokestose, nystose, fructosylnystose, sucrose and inulin were 1.7, 107, 107.5, 63.2, and 1.7, 142, 142.7, 83.9, and 3.9, 152, 152.8, 39.2, and 2.2, 75, 75.4, 34.3, and 38, 79, 79.4, 2.1, and 25.9, 77, 77.4, 3.0, respectively. the hydrolytic activity was strongly inhibited by agno3, sds, and hgcl2. conclusion: the recombinant enzyme had similar specificity to the native enzyme, high affinity for 1-kestose, and low affinity for sucrose and inulin, although properties of the recombinant enzyme showed slight difference from those of the native one previously described.

TI  == human intestinal microbiota: characterization of a simplified and stable gnotobiotic rat model.
AB  == the study of host microbe interactions is hampered by the complexity and inter-individual variability of the human gut microbiota. therefore, a simplified human intestinal microbiota (sihumi) consisting of seven bacterial species was introduced into germfree rats. species selection was based on numerical importance and fermentative abilities in the human gut. association of the rats with the sihumi (anaerostipes caccae, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bifidobacterium longum, blautia producta, clostridium ramosum, escherichia coli and lactobacillus plantarum) resulted in increased faecal concentrations of short chain fatty acids compared to germfree animals. since the faecal butyrate concentration was low (0.9 +/- 0.5 micromol/g dry matter) the sihumi was complemented with clostridium butyricum. this extended bacterial community (sihumix) led to an increased faecal butyrate concentration of 1.5 +/- 0.7 micromol/g dry matter. besides forming scfa, the sihumix was capable of degrading mucins, beta-aspartylglycine and bilirubin. these features are characteristic of  conventional animals but not observed in germfree animals. dietary interventions  with modifications in fibre and fat content led to changes in the proportion of community members. the relative increase of one member of this community in response to a high-fat diet reflects the situation reported for obese mice and human subjects. the strength of the model communities is their remarkable stability over time and their easy transfer to the offspring.

TI  == prevention of escherichia coli o157:h7 infection in gnotobiotic mice associated with bifidobacterium strains.

TI  == a mesocosm of lactobacillus johnsonii, bifidobacterium longum, and escherichia coli in the mouse gut.
AB  == the relative contribution of competition and cooperation at the microbe-microbe level is not well understood for the bacteria constituting the gut microbiota. the high number and variability of human gut commensals have hampered the analysis. to get some insight into the question how so many different bacterial species can coexist in the mammalian gut, we studied the interaction between three human gut commensals (escherichia coli k-12, lactobacillus johnsonii ncc533, and bifidobacterium longum ncc2705) in the intestine of gnotobiotic mice. the bacterial titers and their anatomical distribution were studied in the colonized mice. l. johnsonii achieved the highest cell counts in the stomach, while b. longum dominated the colon. the colon was also the intestinal location in which b. longum displayed the highest number of expressed genes, followed by the cecum and the small intestine. addition of further bacterial strains led to strikingly different results. a lactobacillus paracasei strain coexisted, while a second b. longum strain was excluded from the system. notably, this strain lacked an operon involved in the degradation, import, and metabolism of mannosylated glycans. subsequent introduction of the e. coli nissle strain resulted in the elimination of l. johnsonii ncc533 and e. coli k-12, while b. longum ncc2705 showed a transient decrease in population size, demonstrating the dynamic nature  of microbe-microbe interactions. the study of such simple interacting bacterial systems might help to derive some basic rules governing microbial ecology within  the mammalian gut.

AB  == bifidobacteria are predominant bacteria present in the intestines of breast-fed infants and offer important health benefits for the host. human milk oligosaccharides are one of the most important growth factors for bifidobacteria  and are frequently fucosylated at their non-reducing termini. previously, we identified 1,2-alpha-l-fucosidase (afca) belonging to the novel glycoside hydrolase (gh) family 95, from bifidobacterium bifidum jcm1254 (katayama t, sakuma a, kimura t, makimura y, hiratake j, sakata k, yamanoi t, kumagai h, yamamoto k. 2004. molecular cloning and characterization of bifidobacterium bifidum 1,2-alpha-l-fucosidase (afca), a novel inverting glycosidase (glycoside hydrolase family 95). j bacteriol. 186:4885-4893). here, we identified a gene encoding a novel 1,3-1,4-alpha-l-fucosidase from the same strain and termed it afcb. the afcb gene encodes a 1493-amino acid polypeptide containing an n-terminal signal sequence, a gh29 alpha-l-fucosidase domain, a carbohydrate binding module (cbm) 32 domain, a found-in-various-architectures (fivar) domain and a c-terminal transmembrane region, in this order. the recombinant enzyme was  expressed in escherichia coli and was characterized. the enzyme specifically released alpha1,3- and alpha1,4-linked fucosyl residues from 3-fucosyllactose, various lewis blood group substances (a, b, x, and y types), and lacto-n-fucopentaose ii and iii. however, the enzyme did not act on glycoconjugates containing alpha1,2-fucosyl residue or on synthetic alpha-fucoside (p-nitrophenyl-alpha-l-fucoside). the afca and afcb genes were introduced into the b. longum 105-a strain, which has no intrinsic alpha-l-fucosidase. the transformant carrying afca could utilize 2'-fucosyllactose as the sole carbon source, whereas that carrying afcb was able  to utilize 3-fucosyllactose and lacto-n-fucopentaose ii. we suggest that afca and afcb play essential roles in degrading alpha1,2- and alpha1,3/4-fucosylated milk  oligosaccharides, respectively, and also glycoconjugates, in the gastrointestinal tracts.

TI  == effects of a gluten-free diet on gut microbiota and immune function in healthy adult human subjects.
AB  == diet influences the composition of the gut microbiota and host's health, particularly in patients suffering from food-related diseases. coeliac disease (cd) is a permanent intolerance to cereal gluten proteins and the only therapy for the patients is to adhere to a life-long gluten-free diet (gfd). in the present preliminary study, the effects of a gfd on the composition and immune function of the gut microbiota were analysed in ten healthy subjects (mean age 30.3 years) over 1 month. faecal microbiota was analysed by fluorescence in situ  hybridisation (fish) and quantitative pcr (qpcr). the ability of faecal bacteria  to stimulate cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) was determined by elisa. no significant differences in dietary intake were found before and after the gfd except for reductions (p = 0.001) in polysaccharides. bifidobacterium, clostridium lituseburense and faecalibacterium prausnitzii proportions decreased (p = 0.007, p = 0.031 and p = 0.009, respectively) as a result of the gfd analysed by fish. bifidobacterium, lactobacillus and bifidobacterium longum counts decreased (p = 0.020, p = 0.001 and p = 0.017, respectively), while enterobacteriaceae and escherichia coli counts increased (p  = 0.005 and p = 0.003) after the gfd assessed by qpcr. tnf-alpha, interferon-gamma, il-10 and il-8 production by pbmc stimulated with faecal samples was also reduced (p = 0.021, p = 0.037, p = 0.002 and p = 0.007, respectively) after the diet. therefore, the gfd led to reductions in beneficial  gut bacteria populations and the ability of faecal samples to stimulate the host's immunity. thus, the gfd may constitute an environmental variable to be considered in treated cd patients for its possible effects on gut health.

TI  == bile-inducible efflux transporter from bifidobacterium longum ncc2705, conferring bile resistance.
AB  == bifidobacteria are normal inhabitants of the human gut. some strains of this genus are considered health promoting or probiotic, being included in numerous food products. in order to exert their health benefits, these bacteria must overcome biological barriers, including bile salts, to colonize and survive in specific parts of the intestinal tract. the role of multidrug resistance (mdr) transporters in bile resistance of probiotic bacteria and the effect of bile on probiotic gene expression are not fully understood. in the present study, the effect of subinhibitory concentrations of bile on the expression levels of predicted mdr genes from three different bifidobacterial strains, belonging to bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium  animalis subsp. lactis, was tested. in this way, two putative mdr genes whose expression was induced by bile, bl0920 from b. longum and its homolog, bbr0838, from b. breve, were identified. the expression of the bl0920 gene in escherichia  coli was shown to confer resistance to bile, likely to be mediated by active efflux from the cells. to the best of our knowledge, this represents the first identified bifidobacterial bile efflux pump whose expression is induced by bile.

TI  == effects of probiotic bacteria and their genomic dna on th1/th2-cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) of healthy and allergic  subjects.
AB  == among the factors potentially involved in the increased prevalence of allergic diseases, modification of the intestinal flora or lack of microbial exposure during childhood has been proposed. t(h)2-cytokines increase the production of ige and stimulate mast cells and eosinophils, whereas t(h)1-cytokines, such as ifn-gamma, may suppress ige synthesis and stimulate the expression of the secretory piece of iga. thus, a dysregulation in the expression of t(h)1- and t(h)2-cytokines may contribute to the initiation and maintenance of allergic diseases. lactobacilli belonging to the natural intestinal microflora were reported to reduce the incidence of atopic dermatitis and the severity of allergic manifestations and to modulate t(h)1/t(h)2 responses. the mechanisms still remain to be elucidated. we sought to assess the effect of different probiotics, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus gasseri (pa16/8), bifidobacterium bifidum (mp20/5), and bifidobacterium longum (sp07/3), on the t(h)1 and t(h)2 responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) from healthy subjects and from patients with allergy against house dust mite to staphylococcus enterotoxin a (sea) and dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (dpt). to elucidate the molecular basis of these effects, the effects of bacterial genomic  dna were compared with the effects of viable bacteria. pbmcs from allergic patients and from healthy donors were incubated for 24 or 48 h, respectively, with or without sea and dpt allergens. the effects of preincubation with live probiotic bacteria and the effect of their genomic dna, added simultaneously to cultures and incubated for 24h, were assessed by measuring t(h)1/t(h)2-cytokine production. the tested live gram-positive probiotic bacteria and their genomic dna inhibited sea- and dpt-stimulated secretion of t(h)2-cytokines (il-4 and il-5) and enhanced the stimulation of ifn-gamma. this effect was dose-dependent with a dosage-optimum, which was identical for all lactic acid producing bacteria (lab) tested (10 bacteria per pbmc) and their dna (75 ng/ml). based on the maximal effects achieved with lab and their dna, more than 50% of the effects seem to be contributed by dna. no significant effect was induced by the control,  gram-negative escherichia coli tg1. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria reduced sea-stimulated il-4 and il-5 production more effectively in pbmcs from healthy subjects than from allergic patients. in contrast to this, inhibition of dpt-stimulated il-4- and il-5-secretion was more pronounced in cells from allergic subjects. compared with living lab, bacterial dna inhibited il-4- and il-5-secretion in a similar manner. sea- and even more so dpt-stimulated ifn-gamma stimulation by living lab was less pronounced in allergic than in healthy subjects, whereas ifn-gamma stimulation by their dna was more pronounced  in allergic subjects. the tested probiotic bacteria as well as their genomic dna  modulated the t(h)1/t(h)2 response to some allergens dose-dependently. dna seems  to contribute to 50% of the effect exerted by living bacteria in this in vitro model. the magnitude of the probiotic effects differed between healthy and allergic subjects. whether the modulation found for the tested strains might be useful for the prevention and treatment of allergic diseases has to be assessed in clinical trials.

TI  == in vitro effects of selected synbiotics on the human faecal microbiota composition.
AB  == synbiotics are recognized means of modulating gut microbiota composition and activities. however, whether synbiotics are superior to prebiotics and probiotics alone in moderating the gut microbiota towards a purportedly healthy composition  has not been determined. eight selected synbiotics (short-chain fructooligosaccharides or fructooligosaccharides, each combined with one of four  probiotics, lactobacillus fermentum me-3, lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1, lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2 or bifidobacterium longum 46) were added to 24-h ph-controlled anaerobic faecal batch cultures. the prebiotic and probiotic components were also tested alone to determine their respective role within the synbiotic for modulation of the faecal microbiota. effects upon major groups of the microbiota were evaluated using fish. rifampicin variant probiotic strains were used to assess probiotic levels. synbiotic and prebiotics increased bifidobacteria and the eubacterium rectale-clostridium coccoides group. lower levels of escherichia coli were retrieved with these combinations after 5 and 10  h of fermentation. probiotics alone had little effect upon the groups, however. multivariate analysis revealed that the effect of synbiotics differed from the prebiotics as higher levels of lactobacillus-enterococcus were observed when the  probiotic was stimulated by the prebiotic component. here, the synbiotic approach was more effective than prebiotic or probiotic alone to modulate the gut microbiota.

TI  == characterization of plasmids from human infant bifidobacterium strains: sequence  analysis and construction of e. coli-bifidobacterium shuttle vectors.
AB  == a survey of infant fecal bifidobacterium isolates for plasmid dna revealed that a significant portion of the strains, 17.6%, carry small plasmids. the majority of  plasmid-harboring strains belonged to the bifidobacterium longum/infantis group.  most of the plasmids could be assigned into two groups based on their sizes and the restriction profiles. three plasmids, pb44 (3.6 kb) from b. longum, pb80 (4.9 kb) from bifidobacterium bifidum, and pb21a (5.2kb) from bifidobacterium breve were sequenced. while the former two plasmids were found to be highly similar to  previously characterized rolling-circle replicating pkj36 and pkj56, respectively, the third plasmid, pb21a, does not share significant nucleotide homology with known plasmids. however, it might be placed into the pcibb1-like group of bifidobacterial rolling-plasmids based on the homology of its rep protein and the overall molecular organization. two sets of escherichia coli-bifidobacterium shuttle vectors constructed based on pb44 and pb80 replicons were capable of transforming b. bifidum and b. breve strains with efficiency up to 3x10(4)cfu/microg dna. additionally, an attempt was made to employ a broad host range conjugation element, rp4, in developing of e. coli-bifidobacterium gene transfer system.

TI  == therapeutic potential of two probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease as observed in the trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid model of colitis.
AB  == purpose: the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease is thought to be a multifactorial process. one of the leading hypotheses is that an imbalance in normal gut flora induces an excessive immune response and contributes to inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. administration of probiotic bacteria  reduces symptoms in patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases, probably via both manipulation of the microflora and stimulation of the intestinal immune  system. in the current study the therapeutic potential of two different probiotics-lactobacillus gg and a mixture of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium longum (yo-mix y 109 fro 1000)--in a rat model of colitis were evaluated. methods: male wistar rats were administered probiotics for three days simultaneously with colitis induction. colonic damage was evaluated histologically and biochemically and colonic tissues, as well as fecal samples, were used for bacterial studies using 16s rrna gene primers. results: probiotics administration reduced the relative amounts of  the pathogenic bacteria aeromonas and escherichia coli in the colonic tissue. however, whereas both probiotics affected colon morphology, only lactobacillus gg administration reduced myeloperoxidase activity. conclusions: we report the therapeutic rather than preventive potential of two different probiotics in an animal model of colitis.

TI  == dendritic cells from peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes differ from spleen dendritic cells in their response to commensal gut bacteria.
AB  == commensal gut bacteria have potent effects on the immune system, which are partially mediated by intestinal dendritic cells (dc). distinct commensals confer different properties to in vitro-generated dc. the aim of the present study was to reveal strain-dependent maturation patterns in primary dc. to this end, we compared the response of mouse peyer's patch (pp) dc, mesenteric lymph node (mln) dc and spleen dc to the commensal bacteria, bifidobacterium longum q46, lactobacillus acidophilus x37 and escherichia coli nissle 1917. bacterial maturation of dc occurred independently of tissue origin. expression of ccr7 and  cd103 on the surface of mln dc, necessary for the induction of gut-homing regulatory t cells, increased with stimulation by gram-positive commensals. bacteria-dependent cytokine production (il-6, il-10 and tnf-alpha) was similar in spleen and mln dc, and contaminant cells in these dc preparations produced ifn-gamma in response to l. acidophilus. in contrast, pp dc produced il-6 only in response to e. coli, little il-10 and no tnf-alpha, and this low cytokine production was not due to inhibition by il-10 or tgf-beta. bifidobacteria downregulate il-6, tnf-alpha and il-12 production induced in in vitro-generated dc by l. acidophilus. similar inhibition was observed in splenic dc, but not in mln dc. mln cells responded to bacterial stimulation with higher ifn-gamma production than spleen cells, possibly due to the presence of more responsive natural killer cells. commensal bacteria therefore play specific roles in the gut immune system distinguishable from the effect they would have if recognized by the systemic immune system.

TI  == improved cloning vectors for bifidobacteria, based on the bifidobacterium catenulatum pbc1 replicon.
AB  == this study reports the development of several cloning vectors for bifidobacteria  based on the replicon of pbc1, a cryptic plasmid from bifidobacterium catenulatum l48 thought to replicate via the theta mode. these vectors, in which antibiotic resistance genes encoding either erythromycin or tetracycline resistance acted as selection markers, were able to replicate in a series of eight bifidobacterium species at frequencies ranging from 4.0 x 10(1) to 1.0 x 10(5) transformants microg(-1) but not in lactococcus lactis or lactobacillus casei. they showed a relative copy number of around 30 molecules per chromosome equivalent and a good  segregational stability, with more than 95% of the cells retaining the vectors after 80 to 100 generations in the absence of selection. vectors contain multiple cloning sites of different lengths, and the laczalpha peptide gene was introduced into one of the molecules, thus allowing the easy selection of colonies harboring recombinant plasmids in escherichia coli. the functionality of the vectors for engineering bifidobacterium strains was assessed by cloning and examining the expression of an alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase gene belonging to bifidobacterium longum. e. coli and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum recombinant clones were stable and showed an increase in alpha-arabinofuranosidase activity of over 100-fold compared to that of the untransformed hosts.

TI  == exopolysaccharides produced by intestinal bifidobacterium strains act as fermentable substrates for human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == eleven exopolysaccharides (eps) isolated from different human intestinal bifidobacterium strains were tested in fecal slurry batch cultures and compared with glucose and the prebiotic inulin for their abilities to act as fermentable substrates for intestinal bacteria. during incubation, the increases in levels of short-chain fatty acids (scfa) were considerably more pronounced in cultures with eps, glucose, and inulin than in controls without carbohydrates added, indicating that the substrates assayed were fermented by intestinal bacteria. shifts in molar proportions of scfa during incubation with eps and inulin caused a decrease in the acetic acid-to-propionic acid ratio, a possible indicator of the hypolipidemic effect of prebiotics, with the lowest values for this parameter being obtained for eps from the species bifidobacterium longum and from bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum strain c52. this behavior was contrary to that  found with glucose, a carbohydrate not considered to be a prebiotic and for which a clear increase of this ratio was obtained during incubation. quantitative real-time pcr showed that eps exerted a moderate bifidogenic effect, which was comparable to that of inulin for some polymers but which was lower than that found for glucose. pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 16s rrna gene fragments using universal primers was employed to analyze microbial groups other  than bifidobacteria. changes in banding patterns during incubation with eps indicated microbial rearrangements of bacteroides and escherichia coli relatives. moreover, the use of eps from b. pseudocatenulatum in fecal cultures from some individuals accounted for the prevalence of desulfovibrio and faecalibacterium prausnitzii, whereas incubation with eps from b. longum supported populations close to anaerostipes, prevotella, and/or oscillospira. thus, eps synthesized by  intestinal bifidobacteria could act as fermentable substrates for microorganisms  in the human gut environment, modifying interactions among intestinal populations.

TI  == interaction of probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains with human intestinal epithelial cells: adhesion properties, competition against enteropathogens and modulation of il-8 production.
AB  == the human intestinal microbiota plays a pivotal role in human nutrition and health by promoting the supply of nutrients, preventing pathogen colonization and shaping and maintaining normal mucosal immunity. the depletion of the individual  microbiota can result in a higher susceptibility to enteropathogenic bacteria infection. in order to reduce this risk, the use of food supplements containing probiotic bacteria has been recently addressed. in this paper, we investigate the protective role toward enteropathogen infection of probiotic strains belonging to lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. according to our experimental data, lactobacillus acidophilus bar13, l. plantarum bar10, bifidobacterium longum bar33 and b. lactis bar30 were effective in displacing the enteropathogens salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli h10407 from a caco-2 cell layer. moreover, l. acidophilus bar13 and b. longum bar33 have been assessed for their immunomodulatory activity on il-8 production by ht29 cells. both strains showed the potential to protect enterocytes from an acute inflammatory response. these probiotic strains are potential candidates for the development of new functional  foods helpful in counteracting enteropathogen infections.

TI  == characterisation of glutamine fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (ec 2.6.1.16) and n-acetylglucosamine metabolism in bifidobacterium.
AB  == bifidobacterium bifidum, in contrast to other bifidobacterial species, is auxotrophic for n-acetylglucosamine. growth experiments revealed assimilation of  radiolabelled n-acetylglucosamine in bacterial cell walls and in acetate, an end-product of central metabolism via the bifidobacterial d: -fructose-6-phosphate shunt. while supplementation with fructose led to reduced n-acetylglucosamine assimilation via the d: -fructose-6-phosphate shunt, no significant difference was observed in levels of radiolabelled n-acetylglucosamine incorporated into cell walls. considering the central role played by glutamine fructose-6-phosphate transaminase (glms) in linking the biosynthetic pathway for n-acetylglucosamine to hexose metabolism, the glms of bifidobacterium was characterized. the genes encoding the putative glms of b. longum dsm20219 and b. bifidum dsm20082 were cloned and sequenced. bioinformatic  analyses of the predicted proteins revealed 43% amino acid identity with the escherichia coli glms, with conservation of key amino acids in the catalytic domain. the b. longum glms was over-produced as a histidine-tagged fusion protein. the purified c-terminal his-tagged glms possessed glutamine fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase activity as demonstrated by synthesis of glucosamine-6-phosphate from fructose-6-phosphate and glutamine. it also possesses an independent glutaminase activity, converting glutamine to glutamate  in the absence of fructose-6-phosphate. this is of interest considering the apparently reduced coding potential in bifidobacteria for enzymes associated with glutamine metabolism.

AB  == goals: assessment of the presence of probiotic bacteria in feces after oral ingestion. background: probiotic bacteria are said to have beneficial effects on  the host. as a precondition for any effect, probiotic strains must survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract. study: the feces of seven volunteers  were analyzed for the presence of probiotic strains after one week's oral ingestion of each of six commercially available products: e. coli nissle 0.5-5 x  10(9) cells (mutaflor), enterococcus faecium sf 68 7.5 x 10(7) cells (bioflorin), lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium infantis both 1 x 10(9) cells (infloran), lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium longum both 1 x 10(8) cells (omniflora), lactobacillus casei rhamnosus 1 x 10(9) cells (antibiophilus), and yoghurt enriched with lactobacillus casei immunitas 1 x 10(10) cells (actimel). ten colonies were selected from each stool sample, and dna was extracted and typed using random amplification of polymorphic dna (rapd). typing patterns of the ingested probiotics and the fecal isolates were compared. results: fingerprints identical to the ingested probiotic strains were recovered from fecal samples of 4/7 volunteers after one week of mutaflor, from 4/6 after taking bioflorin, and from 1/6 after infloran. cultivation of strains of the same species from fecal specimens was negative after consumption of antibiophilus, omniflora and actimel. conclusions: after oral consumption of probiotics, e. coli and enterococci could be detected in stool samples (57% and 67%, respectively). in contrast, with only one exception, ingested lactobacilli and bifidobacteria could not be detected in human feces.

TI  == identification of n-acetylhexosamine 1-kinase in the complete lacto-n-biose i/galacto-n-biose metabolic pathway in bifidobacterium longum.
AB  == we have determined the functions of the enzymes encoded by the lnpb, lnpc, and lnpd genes, located downstream of the lacto-n-biose phosphorylase gene (lnpa), in bifidobacterium longum jcm1217. the lnpb gene encodes a novel kinase, n-acetylhexosamine 1-kinase, which produces n-acetylhexosamine 1-phosphate; the lnpc gene encodes udp-glucose hexose 1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, which is also active on n-acetylhexosamine 1-phosphate; and the lnpd gene encodes a udp-glucose 4-epimerase, which is active on both udp-galactose and udp-n-acetylgalactosamine. these results suggest that the gene operon lnpabcd encodes a previously undescribed lacto-n-biose i/galacto-n-biose metabolic pathway that is involved in the intestinal colonization of bifidobacteria and that utilizes lacto-n-biose i from human milk oligosaccharides or galacto-n-biose from mucin sugars.

AB  == a dipeptidase was purified from a cell extract of bifidobacterium longum bori by  ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography on deae-cellulose and q-sepharose columns. the purified dipeptidase had a molecular mass of about 49 kda and was optimally active at ph 8.0 and 50 degrees c. the enzyme was a strict  dipeptidase, being capable of hydrolyzing a range of dipeptides but not tri- and  tetrapeptides, p-nitroanilide derivatives of amino acids, or n- or c-terminus-blocked dipeptides. a search of the amino acid sequence of an internal tryptic fragment against protein sequences deduced from the total genome sequence of b. longum ncc2705 revealed that it was identical to an internal sequence of the dipeptidase gene (pepd), which comprised 1,602 nucleotides encoding 533 amino acids with a molecular mass of 60 kda, and thereby differed considerably from the 49-kda mass of the purified dipeptidase. to understand this discrepancy, pepd was cloned into an escherichia coli expression vector (pbad-topo derivative) to generate the recombinant plasmids pbad-pepd and pbad-pepd-his (note that his in the plasmid designation stands for a polyhistidine coding region). both plasmids  were successfully expressed in e. coli, and the recombinant protein pepd-his was  purified using nickel-chelating affinity chromatography and reconfirmed by internal amino acid sequencing. the pepd sequence was highly homologous to those  of the u34 family of peptidases, suggesting that the b. longum bori dipeptidase is a type of cysteine-type n-terminal nucleophile hydrolase and has a beta-hairpin motif similar to that of penicillin v acylase, which is activated by autoproteolytic processing.

AB  == escherichia coli o157:h7 is capable of surviving the rigorous processing steps during the manufacture of dry fermented sausages. the effect of adding two probiotic organisms, lactobacillus reuteri and bifidobacterium longum as co-cultures with the meat starter cultures pediococcus pentosaceus and staphylococcus carnosus on the viability of e. coli o157:h7 in dry fermented sausages was studied. a 5 strain cocktail of e. coli o157:h7 was added at 7.4 log cfu/g to the sausage batter and challenged with either or both lb. reuteri or b.  longum before or after they were micro-encapsulated. sausages were fermented at < or = 26 degrees c and 88% relative humidity (rh) followed by drying at 75% rh and 13 degrees c for 25 d. the ph, water activity (aw), protein, moisture, and numbers of all inoculated organisms were monitored during processing. the ph and  aw decreased from 5.7 and 0.98 to 4.9 and 0.88 at the end of fermentation and drying, respectively. these processes reduced e. coli o157:h7 by 1.0 and 0.7 log  cfu/g at the end of fermentation and drying, respectively. unencapsulated lb. reuteri with or without b. longum reduced e. coli o157:h7 by 3.0 log cfu/g and b. longum caused a 1.9 log cfu/g reduction. while micro-encapsulation increased survival of lb. reuteri and b. longum, it reduced their inhibitory action against e. coli o157:h7.

TI  == [construction of escherichia coli-bifidobacterium longum shuttle vector and expression of tumor suppressor gene pten in b. longum].
AB  == it was reported that bifidobacterium longum accumulated specifically in hypoxic solid tumors, therefore could be used as a delivery system for cancer-specific gene therapy. furthermore, construction of e.coli-b. longum shuttle vectors was proved by other research to be an efficient way for stable gene expression in b.  longum. to obtain a shuttle vector and analyze the inhibition on mice solid tumors by genetically engineered b. longum, 48 primers with mutual overlaps were  designed, assisted by software package oligo 6.0. by pcr with the above primers,  a linear plasmid was synthesized, which consists of pmb1 and hu gene promoter, both from b. longum. pmb-hu was constructed by cloning the synthesized linear plasmid into e.coli vector pmd 18-t, and was proved to be stably replicated in both e.coli dh5alpha and b. longum l17. by inserting pten cdna into pmb-hu, expression vector pmb-hu-pten was obtained, in which pten gene was reported as a  major tumor suppressor gene encoding a dual-specificity phosphatase. pmb-hu-pten  was then transferred into b. longum l17 by electroporation. after transformation, an effective expression of pten in b. longum l17 was confirmed by western blot, and significant inhibition on growth of mice solid tumors was also observed with  the above genetically engineered b. longum. those obtained results have laid foundation for tumor-targeting gene therapy with b. longum.

TI  == exopolysaccharides produced by probiotic strains modify the adhesion of probiotics and enteropathogens to human intestinal mucus.
AB  == exopolysaccharides (epss) are exocellular polymers present in the surface of many bacteria, including lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. the genome sequence of several strains revealed the presence of eps-encoding genes. however, the physiological role that epss play in the bacterial ecology still remains uncertain. in this study, we have assessed the effect of epss produced by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium longum nb667, and bifidobacterium animalis ipla-r1 on the adhesion of probiotic and enteropathogen strains to human intestinal mucus. the eps fraction gg had no significant effect on the adhesion of l. rhamnosus gg and b. animalis ipla-r1. however, the eps fractions nb667 and  ipla-r1 significantly reduced the adherence of both probiotic strains. in contrast, the three eps fractions increased the adhesion of enterobacter sakazakii atcc 29544 and escherichia coli nctc 8603. higher adherence of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 29631 and clostridium difficile atcc 9689 was detected in the presence of the eps fractions gg and nb667. in general,  these effects were obtained at eps concentrations of up to 5 mg/ml, and they were eps dose dependent. the competitive exclusion of probiotics in the presence of eps could suggest the involvement of these biopolymers in the adhesion to mucus.  the increase in the adherence of enteropathogens could be explained if components of the pathogen surface are able to bind to specific epss and the bound epss are  able to adhere to mucus. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work reporting the effect of epss from probiotics on bacterial adhesion properties.

TI  == adhesion properties and competitive pathogen exclusion ability of bifidobacteria  with acquired acid resistance.
AB  == the adhesion properties of bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium catenulatum strains with an acquired resistance to acid and their ability to competitively exclude salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, enterobacter sakazakii, and clostridium difficile from adhering to human intestinal mucus were evaluated and compared with the results when the same experiments were run with the original acid-sensitive strains. in half of the four studied cases, the acid-resistant derivative showed a greater ability to adhere to human intestinal mucus than the original strain. the ability of bifidobacteria to inhibit pathogen adhesion to mucus was not generally improved by the acquisition of acid resistance. in contrast, three of the four acid-resistant strains showed a greater ability to displace preadhered pathogens  than the original strains, especially preadhered salmonella typhimurium and c. difficile. overall, the induction of acid resistance in bifidobacteria could be a strategy when selecting strains with enhanced stability and improved surface properties that favor their potential functionality as probiotics against specific pathogens.

TI  == antagonistic activity of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria against entero- and uropathogens.
AB  == aim: to develop in vitro assays for comparing the antagonistic properties and anti-oxidative activity of probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains against various entero- and urinary pathogens. methods and results: the antagonistic activity of five probiotic lactobacilli (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus fermentum me-3, lactobacillus acidophilus la5, lactobacillus plantarum 299v and lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2) and two bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium lactis bb12, bifidobacterium longum 46) against six target pathogens was estimated using different assays (solid and liquid media, anaerobic and microaerobic cultivation) and ranked (low, intermediate and high). bacterial  fermentation products were determined by gas chromatography, and the total anti-oxidative activity of probiotics was measured using linolenic acid test. pyelonephritic escherichia coli was highly suppressed by gg and both bifidobacteria strains. lactobacilli strains 8700:2, 299v and me-3 were the most  effective against salmonella enterica ssp. enterica in microaerobic while me-3 and both bifidobacteria expressed high activity against shigella sonnei in anaerobic milieu. lact. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. plantarum strains showed intermediate antagonistic activity against helicobacter pylori under microaerobic conditions on solid media. the highest anti-oxidative activity was characteristic for lact. fermentum me-3 (p < 0.05). no efficient antagonist against clostridium difficile was found. the positive correlations between the ph, lactic acid production and anti-microbial activity for all tested probiotics  were assessed. conclusions: developed experimental assays enable to compare the anti-microbial and -oxidative activity of lactobacillus and/or bifidobacterium probiotics, which have been claimed to possess the ability of suppressing the growth of various enteric and urinary pathogens. significance and impact of the study: screening lactobacillus and bifidobacterium sp. strains according to their activity in various environmental conditions could precede the clinical efficacy  studies for adjunct treatment with probiotics in cure of different gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections.

TI  == a serpin from the gut bacterium bifidobacterium longum inhibits eukaryotic elastase-like serine proteases.
AB  == serpins form a large class of protease inhibitors involved in regulation of a wide spectrum of physiological processes. recently identified prokaryotic members of this protein family may provide a key to the evolutionary origins of the unique serpin fold and the associated inhibitory mechanism. we performed a biochemical characterization of a serpin from bifidobacterium longum, an anaerobic gram-positive bacterium that naturally colonizes human gastrointestinal tract. the b. longum serpin was shown to efficiently inhibit eukaryotic elastase-like proteases with a stoichiometry of inhibition close to 1. porcine pancreatic elastase and human neutrophil elastase were inhibited with the second  order association constants of 4.7 x 10(4) m(-1) s(-1) and 2.1 x 10(4) m(-1) s(-1), respectively. the b. longum serpin is expected to be active in the gastrointestinal tract, because incubation of the purified recombinant serpin with mouse feces produces a stable covalent serpin-protease adduct readily detectable by sds-page. bifidobacteria may encounter both pancreatic elastase and neutrophil elastase in their natural habitat and protection against exogenous proteolysis may play an important role in the interaction between these commensal bacteria and their host.

TI  == a functional analysis of the bifidobacterium longum csca and scrp genes in sucrose utilization.
AB  == the role of genes involved in sucrose catabolism was investigated with a view to  designing effective prebiotic substrates to encourage the growth of bifidobacterium in the gut. two gene clusters coding for sucrose utilisation in bifidobacterium longum ncc2705 were identified in the published genome. the genes encoding putative sucrose degrading enzymes, namely, the scrp (sucrose phosphorylase) and the csca (beta-fructofuranosidase), were cloned from b. longum ncimb 702259(t) and expressed in escherichia coli dh5alpha. both complemented the sucrase negative phenotype of untransformed cells and showed specific sucrase activity. transcriptional analysis of the expression of the genes in b. longum grown in the presence of various carbohydrate substrates showed induction of scrp gene expression in the presence of sucrose and raffinose, but not in the presence of glucose. the csca gene showed no increased transcription in b. longum grown in the presence of any of the carbohydrates tested. phylogenetic analysis indicates  that the b. longum csca protein belongs to a distinct phylogenetic cluster of intracellular fructosidases, which specifically cleave the shorter fructose oligosaccharides.

TI  == lactose-over-glucose preference in bifidobacterium longum ncc2705: glcp, encoding a glucose transporter, is subject to lactose repression.
AB  == analysis of culture supernatants obtained from bifidobacterium longum ncc2705 grown on glucose and lactose revealed that glucose utilization is impaired until  depletion of lactose. thus, unlike many other bacteria, b. longum preferentially  uses lactose rather than glucose as the primary carbon source. glucose uptake experiments with b. longum cells showed that glucose transport was repressed in the presence of lactose. a comparative analysis of global gene expression profiling using dna arrays led to the identification of only one gene repressed by lactose, the putative glucose transporter gene glcp. the functionality of glcp as glucose transporter was demonstrated by heterologous complementation of a glucose transport-deficient escherichia coli strain. additionally, glcp exhibited the highest substrate specificity for glucose. primer extension and real-time pcr analyses confirmed that expression of glcp was mediated by lactose. hence, our data demonstrate that the presence of lactose in culture medium leads to the repression of glucose transport and transcriptional down-regulation of the glucose transporter gene glcp. this may reflect the highly adapted life-style of  b. longum in the gastrointestinal tract of mammals.

TI  == characterization of the genus bifidobacterium by automated ribotyping and 16s rrna gene sequences.
AB  == in order to characterize the genus bifidobacterium, ribopatterns and approximately 500 bp (escherichia coli positions 27 to 520) of 16s rrna gene sequences of 28 type strains and 64 reference strains of the genus bifidobacterium were determined. ribopatterns obtained from bifidobacterium strains were divided into nine clusters (clusters i-ix) with a similarity of 60%. cluster v, containing 17 species, was further subdivided into 22 subclusters with a similarity of 90%. in the genus bifidobacterium, four groups were shown according to miyake et al.: (i) the bifidobacterium longum infantis-longum-suis type group, (ii) the b. catenulatum-pseudocatenulatum group, (iii) the b. gallinarum-saeculare-pullorum group, and (iv) the b. coryneforme-indicum group, which showed higher than 97% similarity of the 16s rrna gene sequences in each group. using ribotyping analysis, unique ribopatterns were obtained from these species, and they could be separated by cluster analysis. ribopatterns of six b.  adolescentis strains were separated into different clusters, and also showed diversity in 16s rrna gene sequences. b. adolescentis consisted of heterogeneous  strains. the nine strains of b. pseudolongum subsp. pseudolongum were divided into five subclusters. each type strain of b. pseudolongum subsp. pseudolongum and b. pseudolongum subsp. globosum and two intermediate groups, which were suggested by yaeshima et al., consisted of individual clusters. b. animalis subsp. animalis and b. animalis subsp. lactis could not be separated by ribotyping using eco ri. we conclude that ribotyping is able to provide another characteristic of bifidobacterium strains in addition to 16s rrna gene sequence phylogenetic analysis, and this information suggests that ribotyping analysis is  a useful tool for the characterization of bifidobacterium species in combination  with other techniques for taxonomic characterization.

TI  == sequence analysis of two cryptic plasmids from bifidobacterium longum djo10a and  construction of a shuttle cloning vector.
AB  == bifidobacterium longum djo10a is a recent human isolate with probiotic characteristics and contains two plasmids, designated pdojh10l and pdojh10s. the  complete sequences of both these plasmids have now been determined and consist of two circular dna molecules of 10,073 and 3,661 bp, with g+c contents of 62.2% and 66.2%, respectively. plasmid pdojh10l is a cointegrate plasmid consisting of dna  regions exhibiting very high sequence identity to two other b. longum plasmids, pnac2 (98%) and pkj50 (96%), together with another region. interestingly, the rolling circular replication (rcr) regions of both the pnac2- and pkj50-like plasmids were disrupted during the recombination event leading to a further recombination event to acquire a functional replicon. this consists of a new fused rep gene and an rcr-type ori consisting of a conserved dnaa box in an at-rich region followed by four contiguous repeated sequences consistent with an  iteron structure and an inverted repeat. the smaller pdojh10s had no sequence similarity to any other characterized plasmid from bifidobacteria. in addition, it did not contain any features consistent with rcr, which is the replication mechanism proposed for all the bifidobacteria plasmids characterized to date. it  did exhibit sequence similarity with several theta replication-related replication proteins from other gram-positive, high-g+c bacteria, with the closest match from a rhodococcus rhodochrous plasmid, suggesting a theta mechanism of replication. s1 nuclease analysis of both plasmids in b. longum djo10a revealed single-strand dna intermediates for pdojh10l, which is consistent for rcr, but none were detected for pdojh10s. as the g+c content of pdojh10s is similar to that of rhodococcus rhodochrous (67%) and significantly higher than that of b. longum (60.1%), it may have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer from a rhodococcus species, as both genera are members of the actinomycetes and are intestinal inhabitants. an escherichia coli-b. longum shuttle cloning vector was constructed from pdojh10s and the e. coli ori region of p15a, a lacz gene with a multiple cloning site of puc18, and a chloramphenicol resistance gene (cat) of pci372 and was transformed successfully into e. coli and b. longum. it could not be introduced into lactic acid bacteria (lactococcus and  lactobacillus), showing it was not very promiscuous. it was stably maintained in  b. longum in the absence of antibiotic pressure for 92 generations, which is consistent with the segregational stability of theta-replicating plasmids in gram-positive bacteria. this is the first cloning vector for bifidobacteria that  does not utilize rcr and should be useful for the stable introduction of heterologous genes into these dominant inhabitants of the large intestine.

AB  == the proteolytic system of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis was analyzed, and an intracellular endopeptidase (pepo) was identified and characterized. this  work reports the first complete cloning, purification, and characterization of a  proteolytic enzyme in bifidobacterium spp. aminopeptidase activities (general aminopeptidases, proline iminopeptidase, x-prolyl dipeptidylaminopeptidase) found in cell extracts of b. animalis subsp. lactis were higher for cells that had been grown in a milk-based medium than for those grown in mrs. a high specific proline iminopeptidase activity was observed in b. animalis subsp. lactis. whole cells and cell wall-bound protein fractions showed no caseinolytic activity; however, the combined action of intracellular proteolytic enzymes could hydrolyze casein fractions rapidly. the endopeptidase activity of b. animalis subsp. lactis was examined in more detail, and the gene encoding an endopeptidase o in b. animalis  subsp. lactis was cloned and overexpressed in escherichia coli. the deduced amino acid sequence for b. animalis subsp. lactis pepo indicated that it is a member of the m13 peptidase family of zinc metallopeptidases and displays 67.4% sequence homology with the predicted pepo protein from bifidobacterium longum. the recombinant enzyme was shown to be a 74-kda monomer. activity of b. animalis subsp. lactis pepo was found with oligopeptide substrates of at least 5 amino acid residues, such as met-enkephalin, and with larger substrates, such as the 23-amino-acid peptide alpha s1-casein(f1-23). the predominant peptide bond cleaved by b. animalis subsp. lactis pepo was on the n-terminal side of phenylalanine residues. the enzyme also showed a post-proline secondary cleavage  site.

TI  == bifidobacterium longum endogalactanase liberates galactotriose from type i galactans.
AB  == a putative endogalactanase gene classified into glycoside hydrolase family 53 was revealed from the genome sequence of bifidobacterium longum strain ncc2705 (schell et al., proc. natl. acad. sci. usa 99:14422-14427, 2002). since only a few endo-acting enzymes from bifidobacteria have been described, we have cloned this gene and characterized the enzyme in detail. the deduced amino acid sequence suggested that this enzyme was located extracellularly and anchored to the cell membrane. gala was cloned without the transmembrane domain into the pbluescript sk(-) vector and expressed in escherichia coli. the enzyme was purified from the  cell extract by anion-exchange and size exclusion chromatography. the purified enzyme had a native molecular mass of 329 kda, and the subunits had a molecular mass of 94 kda, which indicated that the enzyme occurred as a tetramer. the optimal ph of endogalactanase activity was 5.0, and the optimal temperature was 37 degrees c, using azurine-cross-linked galactan (azcl-galactan) as a substrate. the k(m) and v(max) for azcl-galactan were 1.62 mm and 99 u/mg, respectively. the enzyme was able to liberate galactotrisaccharides from (beta1-->4)galactans and (beta1-->4)galactooligosaccharides, probably by a processive mechanism, moving toward the reducing end of the galactan chain after an initial midchain cleavage. gala's mode of action was found to be different from that of an endogalactanase from aspergillus aculeatus. the enzyme seemed to be able to cleave (beta1-->3) linkages. arabinosyl side chains in, for example, potato galactan hindered gala.

TI  == identification and molecular cloning of a novel glycoside hydrolase family of core 1 type o-glycan-specific endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase from bifidobacterium longum.
AB  == we found endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase in most bifidobacterial strains, which are predominant bacteria in the human colon. this enzyme catalyzes the liberation of galactosyl beta1,3-n-acetyl-d-galactosamine (galbeta1,3galnac) alpha-linked to serine or threonine residues from mucin-type glycoproteins. the gene (engbf) encoding the enzyme has been cloned from bifidobacterium longum jcm  1217. the protein consisted of 1,966 amino acid residues, and the central domain  (590-1381 amino acid residues) exhibited 31-53% identity to hypothetical proteins of several bacteria including clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pneumoniae. the recombinant protein expressed in escherichia coli liberated galbeta1,3galnac disaccharide from galbeta1,3galnacalpha1pnp and asialofetuin, but did not release galnac, galbeta1,3(glcnacbeta1,6)galnac, glcnacbeta1,3galnac, and galbeta1,3glcnac from each p-nitrophenyl (pnp) substrate, and also did not release sialo-oligosaccharides from fetuin, indicating its strict substrate specificity for the core 1-type structure. the stereochemical course of hydrolysis was determined by (1)h nmr and was found to be retention. site-directed mutagenesis of a total of 22 conserved asp and glu residues suggested that asp-682 and asp-789 are critical residues for the catalytic activity of the enzyme. the enzyme also exhibited transglycosylation activity toward various mono- and disaccharides and 1-alkanols, demonstrating its potential to synthesize neoglycoconjugates. this is the first report for the isolation of a gene encoding endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase from any organisms and for the establishment of a new glycoside hydrolase family (gh family 101).

TI  == beneficial effects of bifidobacteria in a gastroresistant seamless capsule on hyperhomocysteinemia in hemodialysis patients.
AB  == intestinal microflora is deranged in hemodialysis (hd) patients as an increase in aerobic bacteria such as escherichia coli and a decrease in anaerobic bacteria such as bifidobacterium . bifidobacteria ferment carbohydrates to produce acetic  acid and lactic acid, which inhibit the intestinal putrefaction. thus, intake of  bifidobacteria effectively restores the disturbed microflora to normal. however,  bifidobacteria in most medical products and healthy foods cannot usually survive  because of exposure to gastric juices before it reaches the intestines. a gastroresistant seamless capsule prevents bifidobacteria from inactivation by acidic gastric juice and allows it to be active in the intestines. we showed that the oral administration of bifidobacterium longum in a gastroresistant seamless capsule to hd patients is effective in decreasing the pre-hd serum levels of homocysteine, indoxyl sulfate, and triglyceride. the reduction in the serum level of homocysteine is mainly attributable to the supply of folate produced by bifidobacterium longum in the human intestines.

TI  == bifidobacterium longum requires a fructokinase (frk; atp:d-fructose 6-phosphotransferase, ec 2.7.1.4) for fructose catabolism.
AB  == although the ability of bifidobacterium spp. to grow on fructose as a unique carbon source has been demonstrated, the enzyme(s) needed to incorporate fructose into a catabolic pathway has hitherto not been defined. this work demonstrates that intracellular fructose is metabolized via the fructose-6-p phosphoketolase pathway and suggests that a fructokinase (frk; ec 2.7.1.4) is the enzyme that is  necessary and sufficient for the assimilation of fructose into this catabolic route in bifidobacterium longum. the b. longum a10c fructokinase-encoding gene (frk) was expressed in escherichia coli from a pet28 vector with an attached n-terminal histidine tag. the expressed enzyme was purified by affinity chromatography on a co(2+)-based column, and the ph and temperature optima were determined. a biochemical analysis revealed that frk displays the same affinity for fructose and atp (km(fructose) = 0.739 +/- 0.18 mm and km(atp) = 0.756 +/- 0.08 mm), is highly specific for d-fructose, and is inhibited by an excess of atp (>12 mm). it was also found that frk is inducible by fructose and is subject to glucose-mediated repression. consequently, this work presents the first characterization at the molecular and biochemical level of a fructokinase from a  gram-positive bacterium that is highly specific for d-fructose.

AB  == different methods are used to study bacterial adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells, which is an important step in pathogenic infection as well as in probiotic colonization of the intestinal tract. the aim of this study was to compare the elisa-based method with more conventional plate count and radiolabeling methods for bacterial adhesion detection. an elisa-based assay was optimized for the detection of bifidobacterium longum and escherichia coli o157:h7, which are low and highly adherent bacteria, respectively. in agreement with previous investigations, a percentage of adhesion below 1% was obtained for b. longum with elisa. however, high nonspecific background and low positive signals were measured due to the use of polyclonal antibodies and the low adhesion capacity with this strain. in contrast, the elisa-based method developed for e. coli adhesion detected a high adhesion percentage (15%). for this bacterium the three  methods tested gave similar results for the highest bacterial concentrations (6.8 log cfu added bacteria/well). however, differences among methods increased with the addition of decreased bacterial concentration due to different detection thresholds (5.9, 5.6 and 2.9 log cfu adherent bacteria/well for radioactivity, elisa and plate count methods, respectively). the elisa-based method was shown to be a good predictor for bacterial adhesion compared to the radiolabeling method when good quality specific antibodies were used. this technique is convenient and allows handling of numerous samples.

AB  == the ability of the beta-fructofuranosidase (ec 3.2.1.26) from bifidobacterium lactis dsm 10140t to cleave a variety of fructooligosaccharides was characterised. we identified its gene on a cloned chromosomal dna fragment by sequence similarity (69% identity) to the putative csca protein encoded in the bifidobacterium longum genome. the deduced amino acid sequence of 532 residues (59.4 kda) appeared to be identical to the beta-fructofuranosidase from the same  strain recently described by ehrmann et al. (curr. microbiol. 2003, 46, 391-397). however, the characterisation of the heterologously expressed enzyme showed several discrepancies to the referred study. first, the b. lactis beta-fructofuranosidase gene was found to have 41% identity with csca from e. coli in contrast to the 16% reported, therefore it was assigned to as csca protein instead of bfra. second, we observed only low activity of the enzyme towards sucrose (6%) instead of the 100% previously reported. instead, we measured highest activity (100%) of the enzyme with the oligofructose raftilose as a substrate compared with the inulin of low degree of polymerisation raftiline ls (29%) and the highly polymerised raftiline hp (10%). altogether, the enzyme showed high affinity to terminal beta(2-1) glycosyl linkages between fructose moieties. the km values obtained for raftilose, raftiline ls and sucrose were 0.12, 7.08 and 8.37 mm, respectively, and v(max) values for the conversion to fructose were calculated to be 5, 21 and 17 micromol/min per mg of protein, respectively. growth of b. lactis was supported by fructans of low degree of polymerisation (raftilose and raftiline ls), whereas we observed no growth with highly polymerised inulin (raftiline hp).

TI  == bifidobacterium in gastro-resistant seamless capsule reduces serum levels of indoxyl sulfate in patients on hemodialysis.
AB  == background: intestinal microflora is deranged in hemodialysis (hd) patients as increased aerobacteria such as escherichia coli, and decreased anaerobacteria such as bifidobacteria. indole, a precursor of indoxyl sulfate, is produced by e  coli but not by bifidobacteria. the serum levels of indoxyl sulfate are increased markedly in hd patients and cannot be reduced efficiently by hd because of its albumin binding. methods: to compare the effect of oral administration of bifidobacterium longum in gastro-resistant seamless capsule (bifina) on indoxyl sulfate levels with that of bifidobacteria in powder formulation (lac b), bifina  was administered to 11 hd patients for 5 weeks, and lac b to another group of 11  hd patients for 5 weeks. the authors measured the serum level of indoxyl sulfate  by using high-performance liquid chromatography. results: the pre-hd serum levels of indoxyl sulfate significantly decreased in bifina-treated patients (before, 4.9 +/- 1.7 mg/dl, 4.5 mg/dl, mean +/- sd, median, after 5 weeks, 3.5 +/- 1.3 mg/dl, 3.8 mg/dl; p < 0.005). however, they did not decrease in the lac b-treated patients (before, 4.8 +/- 1.4 mg/dl, 4.5 mg/dl, after 5 weeks, 5.2 +/- 2.0 mg/dl, 5.1 mg/dl). conclusion: oral administration of bifina to hd patients is effective in reducing the serum levels of indoxyl sulfate by correcting the intestinal microflora. gastro-resistant seamless capsule prevents bifidobacteria from its inactivation in acidic gastric juice, and allows it to be actived in the intestine.

TI  == development of a membrane-array method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == a membrane-array method was developed for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples without using the expensive microarray-arrayer and laser-scanner. the 16s rdna sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to nitrocellulose membranes. digoxigenin (dig)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or pure cultured bacteria using two universal primers, and were hybridized to the membrane-array. hybridization signals were read by nbt/bcip color development. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, b. fragilis, b. distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, c. leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, r. bromii, r. callidus, r. albus, bifidobacterium  longum, b. adolescentis, b. infantis, eubacterium biforme, e. aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus,escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the membrane-array method is a reliable technique for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples. the result was also confirmed by  using specific pcr methods for these bacteria.

TI  == inhibitory activity of bifidobacterium longum hy8001 against vero cytotoxin of escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == vero cytotoxin (vt)-producing escherichia coli (vtec), such as e. coli o157:h7, are emerging foodborne pathogens worldwide. vts are associated with hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome in humans. attachment of the b subunit of vts to its receptor, globotriaosylceramide (gb3), at gut epithelium is the primary step and, consequently, the a subunit of vts inhibits protein synthesis in the target cell. proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha and interleukin (il)-1beta, up-regulate gb3 expression, increase sensitivity to vts, and enhance vt action in developing disease. currently, there is a growing interest in probiotics, given the increasing occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. in particular, much work on bifidobacteria among probiotics, regarded as microorganisms targeted for technological and therapeutic applications, has been performed. in korea, the neutralizing effect of the culture supernatant of bifidobacterium longum hy8001, korean isolate, against the vts from e. coli o157:h7 was found. therefore, this study focused on the raveling of the inhibitory effect of b. longum hy8001 against vts, through the interference b subunit of vts and gb3 interaction. mice were inoculated intragastrically with b. longum hy8001 culture supernatant before and after challenge with e. coli o157:h7. control mice were inoculated intragastrically only with e. coli o157:h7. cytokine, tnf-alpha, and il-1beta levels in sera and expression of their mrna were decreased, and expression of gb3 in renal tubular epithelial cells was reduced in mice treated with b. longum hy8001 culture supernatant. in competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisas), the culture supernatant of b. longum hy8001 primarily binds vts to interfere the vts  with gb3 interaction. these results suggest that soluble substance(s) in b. longum hy8001 culture supernatant may have inhibitory activity on the expression  of gb3, vt-gb3 interaction, or both. further study should be done to elucidate the property of soluble substances in b. longum hy8001 culture supernatant.

TI  == purification and characterization of a novel protein produced by bifidobacterium  longum sbt2928 that inhibits the binding of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli pb176 (cfa/ii) to gangliotetraosylceramide.
AB  == a novel protein (bif) which shows inhibitory activity on the binding of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli pb176 (etec with colonization factor antigen (cfa) ii, which consists of coli surface-associated antigens cs1 and cs3) to gangliotetraosylceramide (asialo gm1 or ga1) was isolated from the culture supernatant fluid of bifidobacterium longum sbt2928 (bl2928) at its stationary phase. the homogeneity of the final preparation of bif was demonstrated by sds-page, polyacrylamide gel electrofocusing and n-terminal amino acid sequencing. the bif was characterized as (i) a protein with an m(r) of approximately 104 kda when chromatographed on a gel filtration column, and 52 kda when separated on sds-page, and (ii) having an isoelectric point of 5.9. no change in size was produced by thiol reduction. these results suggest that bif is a homodimer consisting of identical 52 kda monomers. the purified bif at the concentration of 25 micrograms protein ml-1 caused a 50% reduction in binding of  the etec strain to ga1.

TI  == oligofructose contributes to the protective role of bifidobacteria in experimental necrotising enterocolitis in quails.
AB  == bifidobacteria are dominant in the gut of full-term infants, although colonisation by them is often delayed in preterm neonates. bifidobacteria are recognised to have beneficial effects on digestive disorders and they might prevent neonatal necrotising enterocolitis (nec), a gastrointestinal disease that predominantly affects premature infants. they have been shown to protect gnotobiotic quails against nec-like lesions when the birds were inoculated with faecal flora from preterm infants, decreasing the clostridial population. the present study was designed to investigate whether oligofructose, which stimulates the activity of bifidobacteria, may enhance their protective role. experiments were done in eight groups of germ-free quails for 28 days. the groups differed as to their bacterial status, diet and environment. quails were inoculated with one  of two flora from premature twins. the first flora included bifidobacterium pseudo-catenulatum, escherichia coli and no clostridia. the second flora included clostridial species and was associated with b. infantis-longum. caecal bacterial  population and metabolism changes were investigated with a lactose (6%) diet versus a lactose-oligofructose (3%-3%) diet, either in a gnotobiotic environment  or in an ordinary environment permitting post-colonisation by exogenous bacteria. in both environments and with both flora, oligofructose significantly increased the level of bifidobacteria and this was associated with a decrease of e. coli or c. perfringens and c. ramosum. the bacterial changes in the ordinary environment  depended on the initial composition of the microflora and the colonisation resistance against exogenous bacteria was more efficient with the flora that included b. pseudo-catenulatum. the changes in caecal ph and short-chain fatty acids were minimal. it was demonstrated that, irrespective of the environmental conditions, the use of oligofructose helped to prevent the overgrowth of bacteria implicated in necrotising enterocolitis in preterm neonates.

TI  == growth of a human intestinal desulfovibrio desulfuricans in continuous cultures containing defined populations of saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting bacteria.
AB  == ecological and physiological effects of the sulphate-reducing bacterium (srb) desulfovibrio desulfuricans on other intestinal organisms were investigated in anaerobic chemostats (dilution rate approximately 0.2 h-1). reproducible defined  bacterial communities were used in these experiments, comprising 14 different saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting species: bifidobacterium longum, bif. adolescentis, bif. pseudolongum, bif. infantis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bact. vulgatus, lactobacillus acidophilus, enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, cl. butyricum, cl. innocuum, cl. bifermentans. lactobacillus and cl. bifermentans populations never rose above minimum detection limits (log10 2.0 and 4.0, respectively) under the experimental conditions employed in these studies. inclusion of des. desulfuricans in bacterial cultures (c. log10 8.4 viable cells ml-1) resulted in marked reductions (i.e. greater than 1 log) in planktonic cell population densities of several species, particularly bif. longum, cl. perfringens and bif. pseudolongum. the two bacteroides species were unaffected by des. desulfuricans, while numbers of cl. butyricum increased. extensive wall growth developed in the srb culture, consisting mainly of des. desulfuricans (log10 9.2 viable cells ml-1), bact. thetaiotaomicron and bact. vulgatus, with lesser numbers of facultative anaerobes, cl. perfringens and bif. longum. wall growth was associated with a reduction in planktonic cell mass and increased acid production by the cultures.  chemotaxonomic study of chemostat microbiotas, on the basis of cellular fatty acid methyl ester (fame) analyses, showed the existence of characteristic bacteroides (c15) and bifidobacterial (c18) markers, but desulfovibrio markers (i-c15:0, c16:0, i-c17:1) could be identified. the metabolic activities of saccharolytic organisms were altered in the srb chemostat, including synthesis of a number of hydrolytic enzymes involved in carbohydrate breakdown, such as alpha-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase, together with several mucinolytic enzymes. high concentrations of sulphide (8.2 mmol 1-1) were  detected in the srb chemostat, suggesting that this metabolite may have been inhibitory to some species. saccharolytic organisms growing in the srb fermenter  utilized more starch, but less galactose-containing polymers, which correlated with the observed glycosidase activities. profound differences were also recorded with respect to fermentation product formation in the chemostats, where a major switch to acetate production occurred in the srb culture, with concomitant reductions in propionate, butyrate and lactate, which is an important electron donor for desulfovibrios.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

AB  == the recombinant plasmids pdli41, pdga7 and pdco7 were constructed by cloning in pdg7, a vector based on bifidobacterium longum replicon pmb1, the following heterologous genes: pseudomonas fluorescens lipase, bacillus licheniformis alpha-amylase and streptomyces sp. cholesterol oxidase. the hybrid plasmids efficiently transformed bifidobacterium belonging to five different species. a novel escherichia coli-bifidobacterium set of shuttle vectors based on the replicon pmb1 (plf5, pclj15, pspec1) featuring chloramphenicol, erythromycin and  spectinomycin resistance genetic determinants as selection marker for bifidobacteria, was developed. the plasmid ptre3, a derivative of plf5, was the smallest (2.8 kb) bifidobacterium vector, possessed a convenient multicloning site and presented high structural and segregational stability.

TI  == inhibition of bacterial translocation from the gastrointestinal tract of mice by  oral administration of a culture condensate of bifidobacterium longum.
AB  == bacterial translocation occurs when viable bacteria pass through the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract to the mesenteric lymph nodes (mln) and other organs.  the ability of a diet containing 1% culture condensate of bifidobacterium longum  (mb) to inhibit bacterial translocation from the gastrointestinal tract was tested using antibiotic-decontaminated specific-pathogen-free (spf) mice and germ-free mice, both of which were monoassociated with escherichia coli c25. feeding of mb diet decreased the number of e.coli c25 translocating to mln to about half the number of the control diet group, but did not reduce the incidence of translocation to mln. mb diet ingestion also decreased the number of e.coli c25 translocating to mln in the spf mice injected with zymosan, but it could not  prevent bacteria translocation in mice receiving a 30% thermal injury.

TI  == bifidobacteria and human health: regulatory effect of indigenous bifidobacteria on escherichia coli intestinal colonization.
AB  == bifidobacteria are assumed to exert colonization resistance to enteric pathogens. we associated c3h germfree mice with either bifidobacterium longum or escherichia coli or both strains and studied how they settled in the gut and the lymphoid organs as well as their effect on mucus composition. within 24 he. coli colonized the gut of germfree or b. longum ex-germfree mice. in contrast,b. longum was established in the intestine of e. coli ex-germfree mice only 1 month after inoculation whereas it colonized the germfree gut within 24 h. although b. longum did not exert colonization resistance to e. coli, the establishing of bifidobacteria in the gut partly prevented changes in the e. coli cell wall. after colonization of the germfree or b. longum mono-associated mice, e. coli lipopolysaccharide exhibited a higher concentration of kdo and the o-antigen side chain disappeared. a reduction in kdo content was observed within 1 month in e. coli-b. longum diassociated mice whereas it remained at a high level in e. coli mono-associated mice. association in a second step with b. longum led to kdo reduction. changes in e. coli lps might be related to mucus modification. inoculation of either bacterium led to a slow increase in mucus protein content which was however twice as high after e. coli implantation. inoculation of b. longum in a second step led to a reduction in protein content before b. longum colonized the intestine at a high level suggesting that the protein concentration in the mucus was controlled by the host itself. a new glycoprotein of 200-230 kda detected during the period preceeding colonization seemed to be broken down by b. longum. the resulting end product might participate in the restoration of e. coli lps. finally,b. longum inoculation led to the disappearance of e. coli from kidneys, liver, spleen and lung. the organs were cleared of e. coli before b. longum highly colonized the intestine suggesting that high intestinal colonization by b. longum was not required. regulation of e. coli invasion seemed to depend on the ability of b. longum to stimulate the immune system.

TI  == proteinaceous factor(s) in culture supernatant fluids of bifidobacteria which prevents the binding of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli to gangliotetraosylceramide.
AB  == we have examined the competitive binding of several species of bifidobacterium and escherichia coli pb176, an enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) strain, to gangliotetraosylceramide (asialo gm1 or ga1), a common bacterium-binding structure, and identified a factor(s) in the bifidobacterium culture supernatant  fluid that inhibits the binding of e. coli pb176 to ga1. the etec strain we used  expresses colonization factor antigen (cfa) ii, which consists of coli surface-associated antigens cs1 and cs3. competitive exclusion of etec from ga1 molecules by bifidobacterium cells was found by an in vitro thin-layer chromatography overlay binding suppression assay. however, the etec cells were less effective in blocking the adherence of bifidobacterium cells to ga1. these findings suggest that the two bacterial species recognize different binding sites on the ga1 molecule and that the mechanism of competitive exclusion is not due to specific blockage of a common binding site on the molecule. the neutralized culture supernatant fluids of bifidobacterium species, including that of bifidobacterium longum sbt 2928 (bl2928), showed remarkable inhibition of the etec binding to ga1. our results suggest that the binding inhibitor produced by bl2928 is a proteinaceous molecule(s) with a molecular weight around or over 100,000 and a neutral isoelectric point. the binding inhibitor produced by bl2928 and other bifidobacterium species is estimated to contribute to their normal anti-infectious activities by preventing the binding of pathogenic strains of e.  coli to ga1 on the surface of the human intestinal mucosa.

TI  == allosteric activation of l-lactate dehydrogenase analyzed by hybrid enzymes with  effector-sensitive and -insensitive subunits.
AB  == subunit-hybrid enzymes of mutant tetrameric l-lactate dehydrogenases from bifidobacterium longum were studied in an examination of the mechanism of allosteric activation by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. we earlier developed an in vivo method for subunit hybridization in escherichia coli and the hybrids formed  were a mixture with different subunit compositions. the b. longum hybrids were separated by anion-exchange chromatography with a mutational tag. hybrids formed  between fructose 1,6-bisphosphate-desensitized subunits and wild-type subunits and also between fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate-desensitized subunits and catalytically inactive subunits. kinetic analyses of the hybrid enzymes showed that (i) those residues from two symmetrically related subunits that constituted  the fructose 1,6-bisphosphate-binding site could bind fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and activate the enzyme only if intact, (ii) hybrids with only one functional fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate-binding site were fully sensitive to fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate, but the allosteric equilibrium had shifted partially, and (iii) activation by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate at the fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate-binding site was transmitted to the active sites through a quaternary structural change,  not through direct conformational change within a subunit. these results are evidence of the validity of the concerted allosteric model of this enzyme based on t- and r-state structures in the same crystal lattice proposed earlier.

TI  == characterization of the plasmid pmb1 from bifidobacterium longum and its use for  shuttle vector construction.

AB  == urine of mutant ddy/dao- mice lacking d-amino-acid oxidase contained 13 times more d-alanine than that of normal ddy/dao+ mice. because d-alanine is a component of bacterial cell walls, the possibility that the urinary d-alanine came from intestinal bacteria was examined. in ddy/dao- mice that were made germ  free at birth and reared in a germ-free environment, the quantity of urinary d-alanine was found to be at a low level comparable to that of the normal mice. when these germ-free mice were made gnotobiotic by inoculation with gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli and bacteroides vulgatus), the urinary d-alanine increased to a high level. when these gnotobiotic mice were further inoculated with gram-positive bacteria (bifidobacterium longum and eubacterium aerofaciens), the urinary d-alanine increased further. these results indicate that most of the  urinary d-alanine of the conventionally reared ddy/dao- mice is of gastrointestinal bacterial origin.

TI  == mechanism of allosteric transition of bacterial l-lactate dehydrogenase.
AB  == the allosteric behaviour of l-lactate dehydrogenase (l-lactate:nad+oxidoreductase, ec 1.1.1.27, ldh) from bifidobacterium longum am101-2 was studied by means of the subunit hybridization technique as well as x-ray crystallography. homotropic allosteric response of the ldh activity was found against the concentration of its substrate, pyruvate. heterotropic allosteric activation of the enzyme was induced by the addition of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (fbp). two mutant enzymes, which had either altered sensitivity  to fbp or altered substrate specificity from pyruvate to oxaloacetate, were made  by site-directed mutagenesis. hybrid ldhs, between the wild and the mutant ldhs,  were made by in vivo subunit hybridization using double transformation of escherichia coli with two plasmids carrying either the gene of wild or mutant ldh. introduction of only one desensitized mutant subunit to the ldh changed the  characteristic of the wild enzyme to that of the mutant ldh. kinetic studies on hybrid enzymes consisting of subunits having different substrate specificity indicated that there was a strong cooperative interaction among subunits. these results strongly support the idea that the allosteric change of the ldh fits the  concerted-symmetry model proposed by monod, wyman, and changeux. we analysed the  crystallographic structure of the ldh having low affinity to substrate at 1.9 a resolution. by the comparison of the structure with that of other ldhs, we concluded that the conformational transition of the ldh was mainly caused by concerted rotations of subunits.

AB  == the predominance of bifidobacteria in normal breast-fed babies is well established. even under unfavourable hygienic conditions of delivery and during the breast-feeding period bifidobacteria develop and colonize the intestinal tract at high concentrations. in the present study we investigated the interaction between bifidobacterium longum and a pathogenic e. coli strain in the germ-free rat. sequential counts of the two bacterial strains allowed their proliferation to be followed. electron microscopic as well as light microscopic examinations of selected intestinal mucosa segments revealed minor morphological  changes. bifidobacterium completely protected the rats against mortality from a consecutive infection with e. coli. repeated inoculation of bifidobacteria even decreased and kept down the initial e. coli population. thus it appears that the  germ-free rat is an appropriate model to study the development and interaction of both bacterial species and that the sequence of inoculation is most important.

AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.

TI  == assessment of bifidobacteria as indicators of human fecal pollution.
AB  == the distribution of bifidobacteria in the environment has been examined by using  yn-6 medium. although feces of humans, chickens, cows, dogs, pigs, horses, cats,  sheep, beavers, goats, and turkeys were examined, bifidobacteria were isolated only from the feces of humans and swine. the frequency and distribution of component species of human fecal isolates were as in isolates from raw sewage. bifidobacterium longum and b. adolescentis were most often isolated and in the highest densities. the levels of bifidobacteria in raw sewage were in the range of 10(6) organisms/100 ml, and the effect of primary and secondary sewage treatment on the number of viable organisms present was not significant. high densities of bifidobacteria were found in all samples from septic tanks. it was found that bifidobacteria did not survive as well as escherichia coli in either fresh or marine waters. the ratio of bifidobacteria to e. coli is an indication of the age and of the effectiveness of treatment of sewage effluent.

TI  == inhibitory effect of some intestinal bacteria on liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice.
AB  == liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice was markedly promoted by association with a bacterial combination of escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, and clostridium paraputrificum. this study demonstrated that this promoting effect was suppressed by addition of certain intestinal bacteria, such  as bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, and eubacterium rectale.
